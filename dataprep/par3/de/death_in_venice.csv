"Da tauchte zur Rechten die flache Küste auf, Fischerboote belebten das Meer, die Bäderinsel erschien, der Dampfer ließ sie zur Linken, glitt verlangsamten Ganges durch den schmalen Port, der nach ihr benannt ist, und auf der Lagune, angesichts bunt armseliger Behausungen hielt er ganz, da die Barke des Sanitätsdienstes erwartet werden mußte.","Then the flat coast appeared on the right, fishing boats enlivened the sea, the bathing island appeared, the steamer left her on the left, slid down the Ganges through the narrow port that is named after her, and on the lagoon, in the face of colorful miserable dwellings, he stopped quite as the bark of the medical service had to be expected.","Then the flat coast emerged on the right; the sea was alive with fishing smacks; the bathers' island appeared; it dropped behind to the left, the steamer slowly entered the narrow port which is named after it; and on the lagoon, facing gay ramshackle houses, it stopped completely, since it had to wait for the barque of the health department.","Then, to the right, the flat coastline hove in sight, the sea came alive with fishing boats, and the island with its swimming baths appeared. The steamer put the island on its port side and glided at reduced speed through the narrow channel that bore its name, coming to a halt in the lagoon opposite some colorfully dilapidated dwellings, there to await the launch of the health authorities.","There, to his right, the flat coastline began to emerge, fishing boats dotted the sea, and the island resort appeared. The steamer passed it on the left, sailing at reduced speed into the narrow port of the same name. Then it came to a full stop in the Lagoon in front of some picturesque ramshackle structures to await the quarantine authorities’ skiff."
"Was war zu tun? Allein auf der Flut mit dem sonderbar unbotmäßigen, unheimlich entschlossenen Menschen, sah der Reisende kein Mittel, seinen Willen durchzusetzen. Wie weich er übrigens ruhen durfte, wenn er sich nicht empörte. Hatte er nicht gewünscht, daß die Fahrt lange, daß sie immer dauern möge? Es war das Klügste, den Dingen ihren Lauf zu lassen, und es war hauptsächlich höchst angenehm. Ein Bann der Trägheit schien auszugehen von seinem Sitz, von diesem niedrigen, schwarzgepolsterten Armstuhl, so sanft gewiegt von den Ruderschlägen des eigenmächtigen Gondoliers in seinem Rücken. Die Vorstellung, einem Verbrecher in die Hände gefallen zu sein, streifte träumerisch Aschenbachs Sinn,—unvermögend, seine Gedanken zu tätiger Abwehr aufzurufen. Verdrießlicher schien die Möglichkeit, daß alles auf simple Geldschneiderei angelegt sei. Eine Art Pflichtgefühl oder Stolz, die Erinnerung gleichsam, daß man dem vorbeugen müsse, vermochte ihn, sich noch einmal aufzuraffen. Er fragte:","What was to be done? Alone on the tide with the strangely insubordinate, incredibly determined man, the traveler saw no means of getting his way. By the way, how softly he could rest if he didn't rebel. Hadn't he wished that the journey would be long, that it would last forever? It was the wisest thing to let things take their course, and mostly it was most enjoyable. A spell of inertia seemed to emanate from his seat, from that low, black-upholstered armchair, rocked so gently by the oars of the high-handed gondolier behind him. The idea of having fallen into the hands of a criminal dreamily touched Aschenbach's mind—unable to summon his thoughts to active defense. More vexatious seemed the possibility that everything was designed for simple money-making. A kind of sense of duty or pride, the reminder, as it were, that one had to prevent this, enabled him to pull himself together again. He asked:","What was to be done? This man was strangely insolent, and had an uncanny decisiveness; the traveller, alone with him on the water, saw no way of getting what he wanted. And besides, how softly he could rest, if only he did not become excited! Hadn't he wanted the trip to go on and on for ever? It was wisest to let things take their course, and the main thing was that he was comfortable. The poison of inertia seemed to be issuing from the seat, from this low, black-upholstered arm-chair, so gently cradled by the oar strokes of the imperious gondolier behind him. The notion that he had fallen into the hands of a criminal passed dreamily across Aschenbach's mind—without the ability to summon his thoughts to an active defence. The possibility that it was all simply a plan for cheating him seemed more abhorrent. A feeling of duty or pride, a kind of recollection that one should prevent such things, gave him the strength to arouse himself once more. He asked: ""What are you asking for the trip?""","What was he to do? Alone on the water with this oddly obstreperous, uncannily determined man, the traveler saw no way of imposing his will. Besides, what a nice rest he could have if he did not lose his temper! Had he not wished the trip to last longer, last forever? It was wisest to let things take their course; what is more, it was highly pleasant. A spellbinding indolence seemed to emanate from his seat, that low armchair upholstered in black, so gently rocked by the oar strokes of the self-willed gondolier behind him. The idea that he had fallen into the hands of a criminal drifted dreamily through Aschenbach’s mind, but it was powerless to stir him to active resistance. More upsetting was the possibility that it could all be put down to simple money grubbing. A sense of duty or pride, the recollection, as it were, that one might forestall such things, moved him to pull himself together, and he asked, “What do you charge for the trip?”","What was there to do? Alone, swept along by the current with this oddly insubordinate, eerily determined man, the traveler could see no way to enforce his will. And anyway, how very comfortable he could make himself, so long as he didn’t cause a fuss! Hadn’t he wished that the trip would take longer, that it would go on forever? It was wisest and, more to the point, most agreeable to let things take their course. A spell of lethargy seemed to emanate from his seat, from this low-slung, black-upholstered armchair that was gently rocked by the oar strokes of the all-powerful gondolier behind him. The idea of having fallen into criminal hands flashed through Aschenbach’s mind like a dream but was incapable of rousing his conscious mind to any act of self-defense. The more irritating possibility was that it was all just an attempt at petty extortion. Some feeling related to duty or pride—akin to the suddenly remembered necessity of taking heed, lest one or the other flare up—allowed Aschenbach to gather himself once more. He asked:"
"Es war am folgenden Morgen, daß er, im Begriff das Hotel zu verlassen, von der Freitreppe aus gewahrte, wie Tadzio, schon unterwegs zum Meere—und zwar allein,—sich eben der Strandsperre näherte. Der Wunsch, der einfache Gedanke, die Gelegenheit zu nutzen und mit dem, der ihm unwissentlich so viel Erhebung und Bewegung bereitet, leichte, heitere Bekanntschaft zu machen, ihn anzureden, sich seiner Antwort, seines Blickes zu erfreuen, lag nahe und drängte sich auf. Der Schöne ging schlendernd, er war einzuholen, und Aschenbach beschleunigte seine Schritte. Er erreicht ihn auf dem Brettersteig hinter den Hütten, er will ihm die Hand aufs Haupt, auf die Schulter legen und irgend ein Wort, eine freundliche französische Phrase schwebt ihm auf den Lippen: da fühlt er, daß sein Herz, vielleicht auch vom schnellen Gang, wie ein Hammer schlägt, daß er, so knapp bei Atem, nur gepreßt und bebend wird sprechen können; er zögert, er sucht sich zu beherrschen, er fürchtet plötzlich, schon zu lange dicht hinter dem Schönen zu gehen, fürchtet sein Aufmerksamwerden, sein fragendes Umschauen, nimmt noch einen Anlauf, versagt, verzichtet und geht gesenkten Hauptes vorüber.","It was the following morning when he was about to leave the hotel when he saw from the outside staircase how Tadzio, who was already on his way to the sea—and alone—was just approaching the beach barrier. The wish, the simple thought, to seize the opportunity and make an easy, cheerful acquaintance with the one who unknowingly causes him so much elevation and movement, to speak to him, to enjoy his answer, his look, was obvious and forced itself on him . The handsome man was strolling, he could be caught, and Aschenbach quickened his steps. He reaches him on the boardwalk behind the huts, he wants to put his hand on his head, on his shoulder and a word, a friendly French phrase floats on his lips: then he feels that his heart, perhaps also from the fast pace bangs like a hammer, so that he, so short of breath, will only be able to speak tightly and trembling; he hesitates, he tries to control himself, he suddenly fears that he has been walking close behind the beautiful for too long, fears that he will pay attention, that he will look around questioningly, makes another attempt, fails, renounces and passes by with his head bowed.","The following morning, as he was about to leave the hotel, he looked off from the steps and noticed that Tadzio, who was alone and was already on his way towards the sea, was just approaching the private beach. He was half tempted by the simple notion of seizing this opportunity to strike up a casual friendly acquaintanceship with the boy who had been the unconscious source of so much agitation and upheaval; he wanted to address him, and enjoy the answering look in his eyes. The boy was sauntering along, he could be overtaken; and Aschenbach quickened his pace. He reached him on the boardwalk behind the bathing houses; was about to lay a hand on his head and shoulders; and some word or other, an amiable phrase in French, was on the tip of his tongue. But he felt that his heart, due also perhaps to his rapid stride, was beating like a hammer; and he was so short of breath that his voice would have been tight and trembling. He hesitated, he tried to get himself under control. Suddenly he became afraid that he had been walking too long so close behind the boy. He was afraid of arousing curiosity and causing him to look back questioningly. He made one more spurt, failed, surrendered, and passed with bowed head.","The following morning he was going down the front steps, about to leave the hotel, when he spied Tadzio—alone—nearing the beach gate on his way to the sea. The desire, the mere thought of taking the opportunity to make the casual, offhand acquaintance of the beautiful boy who had unknowingly so elated and moved him, to address him and take pleasure in his response and the look in his eyes—nothing could be more natural, more obvious. The boy was ambling slowly—he could easily be overtaken—and Aschenbach merely accelerated his pace. He caught up to him on the boardwalk in back of the cabanas and was on the point of laying his hand on his head or shoulder—a phrase, some friendly words in French on his lips—when he felt his heart hammering wildly, from the quick pace perhaps, and he was so breathless that his voice would have been hoarse and strained had he tried to speak. He paused and struggled to get hold of himself, but suddenly feared he had been walking too long just behind the boy, feared the boy would notice, turn and look at him questioningly, so he had one more go at it, failed, surrendered, and walked past with downcast eyes.","It was on the following morning when, in the process of leaving the hotel, he noticed from atop the front steps that the already ocean-bound Tadzio was approaching—alone—the gate that led to the beach. He was seized by a wish, an ever so simple plan. He could exploit the opportunity and establish easy, friendly contact with the unwitting cause of his great inner uprising and turmoil. He could address the boy, then bask in the attention when he responded. The beautiful boy was ambling along, he was slow enough to be overtaken, and Aschenbach hurried his steps. He catches up with him on the wooden stairs to the rear of the huts, he’s determined to lay a hand on the boy’s head or clap him on the shoulders and say something; an amiable French phrase is on the tip of his tongue. But then he feels his heart beating like a hammer—perhaps this is also due to the physical exertion—and senses how panting and tremulous his voice will sound with him breathing so heavily. He hesitates, tries to regain composure and suddenly fears that he has trailed the boy for too long, that something will attract his attention and make him turn around. He begins another approach and breaks it off, before finally giving up and walking past his quarry with his head down."
"Wunderlich unglaubhaftes, beschämendes, komisch traumartiges Abenteuer: Stätten, von denen man eben in tiefster Wehmut Abschied auf immer genommen, vom Schicksal umgewandt und zurückverschlagen, in derselben Stunde noch wiederzusehen! Schaum vor dem Buge, drollig behend zwischen Gondeln und Dampfern lavierend, schoß das kleine, eilfertige Fahrzeug seinem Ziele zu, indes sein Passagier unter der Maske ärgerlicher Resignation die ängstlich-übermütige Erregung eines entlaufenen Knaben verbarg. Noch immer, von Zeit zu Zeit, ward seine Brust bewegt von Lachen über dies Mißgeschick, das, wie er sich sagte, ein Sonntagskind nicht gefälliger hätte heimsuchen können. Es waren Erklärungen zu geben, erstaunte Gesichter zu bestehen,—dann war, so sagte er sich, alles wieder gut, dann war ein Unglück verhütet, ein schwerer Irrtum richtig gestellt, und alles, was er im Rücken zu lassen geglaubt hatte, eröffnete sich ihm wieder, war auf beliebige Zeit wieder sein… Täuschte ihn übrigens die rasche Fahrt oder kam wirklich zum Überfluß der Wind nun dennoch vom Meere her?","Wonderfully unbelievable, shameful, comically dreamlike adventure: places from which one has just said goodbye in the deepest melancholy, turned around by fate and thrown back, to see again in the same hour! Foaming at the bow, navigating drollly nimbly between gondolas and steamers, the small, hasty craft shot toward its destination, while its passenger hid the anxious, high-spirited excitement of a runaway boy under the mask of angry resignation. Still, from time to time, his heart was stirred with laughter at that misfortune, which, he told himself, could not have visited a Sunday child more agreeably. There were explanations to be given, astonished faces to be passed—then, he told himself, everything would be all right again, then an accident would be avoided, a serious mistake corrected, and everything that he had thought he had left behind would be revealed him again, was his again at any time… By the way, was he deceived by the rapid journey, or was the wind blowing from the sea?","Here was an adventure, wonderful, abashing, and comically dreamlike beyond belief: places which he had just bid farewell to for ever in the most abject misery—yet he had been turned and driven back by fate, and was seeing them again in the same hour! The spray from the bow, washing between gondolas and steamers with an absurd agility, shot the speedy little craft ahead to its goal, while the one passenger was hiding the nervousness and ebullience of a truant boy under the mask of resigned anger. From time to time he shook with laughter at this mishap which, as he told himself, could not have turned out better for a child of destiny. There were explanations to be given, expressions of astonishment to be faced—and then, he told himself, everything would be all right; then a misfortune would be avoided, a grave error rectified. And all that he had thought he was leaving behind him would be open to him again, there at his disposal. . . . And to cap it all, was the rapidity of the ride deceiving him, or was the wind really coming from the sea?","What an oddly improbable, humiliating, comically dreamlike adventure: taking brokenhearted leave of places forever and then, turned round and spirited back by a quirk of fate, seeing them again within the hour! Spray at the prow, tacking with playful agility between gondolas and vaporetti, the swift little vessel raced towards its destination, its sole passenger concealing beneath a mask of resigned indignation the anxious yet high-spirited agitation of a child who has run away from home. From time to time his breast still shook with laughter at the thought of this mishap, which, he said to himself, could not have befallen even the luckiest of men at a more opportune moment There were explanations to give, astonished faces to confront, but then, he said to himself, everything would be fine again, a disaster averted, a grievous error rectified, and everything he thought he had left behind would once more open up before him, his to enjoy for as long as he so desired…And was it only the speed of the launch or was there actually, on top of it all, a breeze blowing in from the sea?","An unbelievably strange, humbling adventure! An absurd interlude from a dream! To stand again before the very stations from which you have just parted forever, in the deepest of sorrow! To stand there less than an hour later, because fate has turned you round and sent you back! Dodging gondola and vaporetti in a series of amusingly nimble back-and-forth tacks, the eager little boat proceeded toward its destination, spray before its bow, its lone passenger concealing the anxious exuberance of a truant schoolboy under a mask of irritated resignation. Now and then, his sides still shook with laughter at his mishap, which, as he told himself, couldn’t have come at a more opportune time. Explanations would have to be given, surprised looks endured—but then, as he told himself, everything would be put right, a disaster averted, a serious mistake rectified, and all that he thought he had left behind would open up once more before him, to be had at his leisure. What’s more, did the speed of the motorboat deceive him, or was the wind now, to top it all off, indeed really blowing in from the sea?"
"Aus diesem Traum erwachte der Heimgesuchte entnervt, zerrüttet und kraftlos dem Dämon verfallen. Er scheute nicht mehr die beobachtenden Blicke der Menschen; ob er sich ihrem Verdacht aussetze, kümmerte ihn nicht. Auch flohen sie ja, reisten ab; zahlreiche Strandhütten standen leer, die Besetzung des Speisesaals wies größere Lücken auf, und in der Stadt sah man selten noch einen Fremden. Die Wahrheit schien durchgesickert, die Panik, trotz zähen Zusammenhaltens der Interessenten, nicht länger hintanzuhalten. Aber die Frau im Perlenschmuck blieb mit den Ihren, sei es, weil die Gerüchte nicht zu ihr drangen, oder weil sie zu stolz und furchtlos war, um ihnen zu weichen: Tadzio blieb; und jenem, in seiner Umfangenheit, war es zuweilen, als könne Flucht und Tod alles störende Leben in der Runde entfernen und er allein mit dem Schönen auf dieser Insel zurückbleiben,—ja, wenn vormittags am Meere sein Blick schwer, unverantwortlich, unverwandt auf dem Begehrten ruhte, wenn er bei sinkendem Tage durch Gassen, in denen verheimlichterweise das ekle Sterben umging, ihm unwürdig nachfolgte, so schien das Ungeheuerliche ihm aussichtsreich und hinfällig das Sittengesetz.","From this dream, the afflicted woke up unnerved, shattered and powerless, succumbed to the demon. He no longer shied away from people's observing looks; whether he exposed himself to their suspicions did not concern him. They too fled, departed; numerous beach huts stood empty, the dining room was vacant, and a stranger was seldom seen in town. The truth seemed to have leaked out, and the panic could no longer be held back, despite the interested parties' tenacious solidarity. But the woman in pearl jewelry stayed with her, either because the rumors didn't reach her or because she was too proud and fearless to give way to them: Tadzio stayed; and to that one, in his expansiveness, it sometimes felt as if flight and death could remove all disturbing life around and he could remain alone with the beautiful things on this island—yes, if in the morning at the sea his gaze was heavy, irresponsible, fixed on the When the day was setting he followed him unworthily through streets in which disgusting dying was secretly going about, the monstrous seemed promising and the moral law was invalid.","When he awakened from the affliction of this dream he was unnerved, shattered, and hopelessly under the power of the demon. He no longer avoided the inquisitive glances of other people; he did not care if he was exciting their suspicions. And as a matter of fact they were fleeing, travelling elsewhere. Numerous bathing houses stood empty, the occupants of the dining-hall became more and more scattered, and in the city now one rarely saw a foreigner. The truth seemed to have leaked out; the panic, despite the reticence of those whose interests were involved, seemed no longer avoidable. But the woman with the pearls remained with her family, either because the rumours had not yet reached her, or because she was too proud and fearless to heed them. Tadzio remained. And to Aschenbach, in his infatuation, it seemed at times as though flight and death might remove all the disturbing elements of life around them, and he stay here alone with the boy. Yes, by the sea in the forenoon when his eyes rested heavily, irresponsibly, unwaveringly on the thing he coveted, or when, as the day was ending, he followed shamelessly after him through streets where the hideous death lurked in secret—at such times the atrocious seemed to him rich in possibilities, and laws of morality had dropped away.","The stricken man awoke from his dream unnerved and shaken, powerless in the demon’s thrall. He no longer shunned the curious glances of the people around him: whether he aroused their suspicion was of no concern to him. They were fleeing, were they not, leaving Venice: many of the cabanas were vacant, a number of tables in the dining room unoccupied, and in the city there was scarcely a foreigner to be seen. The truth seemed to have leaked out despite the tenacious solidarity among interested parties in their attempt to ward off panic. But the woman in pearls stayed on with her family either because the rumors had not reached her or because she was too proud and fearless to heed them. Thus Tadzio stayed on, and Aschenbach, in his beleaguered state, occasionally had the feeling that flight and death might eliminate all life standing in his way and leave him alone on this island with the beautiful boy; indeed, when he sat in the morning by the sea, his gaze—heavy, injudicious, and fixed—resting on the object of his desire, or when, as evening fell, he resumed his undignified pursuit through the narrow streets clandestinely haunted by loathsome dying, things monstrous seemed auspicious and the moral code null and void.","The stricken Aschenbach awoke from this dream unnerved and shattered, delivered up helplessly to the demon. He no longer avoided the observant eyes of others; whether he exposed himself to their suspicions was now entirely irrelevant. In any case, they were taking flight, traveling on. Many of the changing huts now stood unoccupied, larger gaps had opened up between patrons in the dining room, and foreigners were a rare sight in the city. The truth seemed to have seeped out, and despite the dogged solidarity of the interested parties, panic could no longer be averted. Yet the lady with the pearl necklace stayed on with her family. Perhaps she didn’t hear the rumors; perhaps she was too proud and fearless to budge. In any case Tadzio remained, and to Aschenbach in his rapture, it sometimes seemed as if departure and death might remove all other disturbing presences from their midst, leaving him alone on the island with the beautiful boy. Indeed, every morning by the sea, as his eye dwelt with a hard, reckless, fixed stare on the object of his desire, or at sunset, as he ignobly followed that object through the alleys where the progress of the vile plague was being concealed, monstrosities began to seem propitious, moral law invalid."
"Das ist wahr, dachte Aschenbach und spannte sich ab. Das ist wahr, du fährst mich gut. Selbst, wenn du es auf meine Barschaft abgesehen hast und mich hinterrücks mit einem Ruderschlage ins Haus des Aides schickst, wirst du mich gut gefahren haben. Allein nichts dergleichen geschah. Sogar Gesellschaft stellte sich ein, ein Boot mit musikalischen Wegelagerern, Männern und Weibern, die zur Guitarre, zur Mandoline sangen, aufdringlich Bord an Bord mit der Gondel fuhren und die Stille über den Wassern mit ihrer gewinnsüchtigen Fremdenpoesie erfüllten. Aschenbach warf Geld in den hingehaltenen Hut. Sie schwiegen dann und fuhren davon. Und das Flüstern des Gondoliers war wieder wahrnehmbar, der stoßweise und abgerissen mit sich selber sprach.","That's true, Aschenbach thought and relaxed. That's true, you drive me fine. Even if you're after my cash and send me back with an oar to the Aides' house, you'll have driven me well. But nothing of the sort happened. There was even company, a boat with musical highwaymen, men and women who sang to the guitar and the mandolin, obstinately rode the gondola on board and filled the stillness above the waters with their lucrative foreign poetry. Aschenbach threw money into the hat he was holding out. Then they fell silent and drove away. And the whispering of the gondolier was audible again, speaking raggedly and jerkily to himself.","That is so, Aschenbach thought, and relaxed. That is so; you are rowing me well. Even if you do have designs on my cash, and send me down to Pluto with a blow of your oar from behind, you will have rowed me well. But nothing like that happened. They were even joined by others: a boatload of musical brigands, men and women, who sang to guitar and mandolin, riding persistently side by side with the gondola and filling the silence over the water with their covetous foreign poetry. A hat was held out, and Aschenbach threw in money. Then they stopped singing, and rowed away. And again the muttering of the gondolier could be heard as he talked fitfully and jerkily to himself.","Fair enough, thought Aschenbach, relaxing. Fair enough. You are rowing me well. Even if you are after my purse and send me to the House of Hades with a bash of the oar from behind, you will have rowed me well. But nothing of the sort occurred. They even had company: a boatload of musical highwaymen, men and women both, singing to a guitar and a mandolin and sailing solicitously alongside the gondola, filling the stillness over the waters with their venal for-foreigners-only poetry. Aschenbach tossed some money into the hat they held out. They immediately fell silent and departed, whereupon he could hear the gondolier whispering again, carrying on his intermittent conversation with himself.","That’s the truth, thought Aschenbach, giving up. You are taking me well, no doubt about that. You may just be out for the money I’m carrying, you may clobber me from behind with your oar and send me to Pluto’s dark domain, but you’ll have taken me well. Only nothing of the sort happened. On the contrary, they even had company, a boatload of musical pirates, both men and women, singing to guitar and mandolin. They pushed their way hard alongside the gondola and shattered the silence on the water with profit-hungry tourist lyrics. Aschenbach threw some money into their outstretched hat, and they ceased playing immediately and moved off. Once again the gondolier could be heard, talking to himself in spasmodic, panting breaths."
"Wenn dann die Menge durch die geöffneten Portale hinausströmte auf den leuchtenden, von Tauben wimmelnden Platz, verbarg sich der Betörte in der Vorhalle, er versteckte sich, er legte sich auf die Lauer. Er sah die Polen die Kirche verlassen, sah, wie die Geschwister sich auf zeremoniöse Art von der Mutter verabschiedeten und wie diese sich heimkehrend zur Piazzetta wandte; er stellte fest, daß der Schöne, die klösterlichen Schwestern und die Gouvernante den Weg zur Rechten durch das Tor des Uhrturmes und in die Merceria einschlugen, und nachdem er sie einigen Vorsprung hatte gewinnen lassen, folgte er ihnen, folgte ihnen verstohlen auf ihrem Spaziergang durch Venedig.","Then when the crowd streamed out through the open portals onto the luminous square teeming with pigeons, the besotted man hid himself in the vestibule, he hid himself, he lay in wait. He saw the Poles leaving the church, saw the brothers and sisters ceremonially saying goodbye to their mother and how she turned to the Piazzetta on her way home; he found the fair one, the monastic sisters, and the governess turning right through the gate of the clock tower and into the Merceria, and after letting them gain some headway, he followed them, surreptitiously following them as they walked through Venice.","When the crowd was streaming out through the opened portals into the brilliant square with its swarms of pigeons, the lover hid in the vestibule; he kept trader cover, he lay in wait. He saw the Poles quit the church, saw how the children took ceremonious leave of their mother, and how she turned towards the Piazzetta on her way home. He made sure that the boy, the nunlike sisters, and the governess took the road to the right through the gateway of the dock tower and into the Merceria. And after giving them a slight start, he followed, followed them furtively on their walk through Venice.","Then, as the crowd poured through the opened portals into the radiant square teeming with pigeons, the beguiled traveler would lurk in the vestibule, hiding, lying in ambush. He would watch the Poles go out of the church, watch the siblings take ceremonious leave of their mother, who then set off for home in the direction of the Piazzetta. Having ascertained that the boy, his nunlike sisters, and their governess would turn right and proceed through the clock tower gateway into the Merceria, he gave them a head start and then followed them, followed them furtively on their stroll through Venice.","Then, when the giant doors opened and the crowds streamed out onto the bright Piazza, aswarm with pigeons, the enthralled Aschenbach hid in the vestibule, lying in wait. He watched the Polish family depart from church, watched the children take ceremonious leave of their mother, who turned into the Piazetta toward home. He confirmed that the beautiful boy, the cloistral sisters and their governess had turned right through the gateway of the clock tower into the Merceria; and, after letting them get a head start, he followed them, followed them surreptitiously as they strolled through Venice."
"Der wohlige Gleichtakt dieses Daseins hatte ihn schon in seinen Bann gezogen, die weiche und glänzende Milde dieser Lebensführung ihn rasch berückt. Welch ein Aufenthalt in der Tat, der die Reize eines gepflegten Badelebens an südlichem Strande mit der traulich bereiten Nähe der wunderlich-wundersamen Stadt verbindet! Aschenbach liebte nicht den Genuß. Wann immer und wo es galt, zu feiern, der Ruhe zu pflegen, sich gute Tage zu machen, verlangte ihn bald—und namentlich in jüngeren Jahren war dies so gewesen—mit Unruhe und Widerwillen zurück in die hohe Mühsal, den heilig nüchternen Dienst seines Alltags. Nur dieser Ort verzauberte ihn, entspannte sein Wollen, machte ihn glücklich. Manchmal vormittags, unter dem Schattentuch seiner Hütte, hinträumend über die Bläue des Südmeers, oder bei lauer Nacht auch wohl, gelehnt in die Kissen der Gondel, die ihn vom Markusplatz, wo er sich lange verweilt, unter dem groß gestirnten Himmel heimwärts zum Lido führte—und die bunten Lichter, die schmelzenden Klänge der Serenade blieben zurück,—erinnerte er sich seines Landsitzes in den Bergen, der Stätte seines sommerlichen Ringens, wo die Wolken tief durch den Garten zogen, fürchterliche Gewitter am Abend das Licht des Hauses löschten und die Raben, die er fütterte, sich in den Wipfeln der Fichten schwangen. Dann schien es ihm wohl, als sei er entrückt ins elysische Land, an die Grenzen der Erde, wo leichtestes Leben den Menschen beschert ist, wo nicht Schnee ist und Winter noch Sturm und strömender Regen, sondern immer sanft kühlenden Anhauch Okeanos aufsteigen läßt und in seliger Muße die Tage verrinnen, mühelos, kampflos und ganz nur der Sonne und ihren Festen geweiht.","The pleasant synchronicity of this existence had already drawn him under its spell, the soft and shining gentleness of this way of life quickly captivated him. What a stay indeed, which combines the charms of a well-groomed bathing life on a southern beach with the cozy, ready proximity of the wondrous, wondrous city! Aschenbach did not like pleasure. Whenever and wherever there was a need to celebrate, to keep calm, to have a good day, he soon demanded—and this had been the case especially when he was younger—with restlessness and reluctance to return to the great toil, the holy, sober service of his everyday Only this place enchanted him, relaxed his will, made him happy. Sometimes in the morning, under the shady cloth of his hut, daydreaming about the blue of the South Sea, or on a mild night, too, leaning on the cushions of the gondola that took him home from St. Mark's Square, where he lingered for a long time, under the starry sky to the Lido —and the colorful lights, the melting sounds of the serenade remained behind,—he remembered his country estate in the mountains, the site of his summer struggle, where the clouds drifted low through the garden, terrible thunderstorms in the evening put out the light in the house and the ravens, which he fed, swung in the tops of the spruces. Then it seemed to him as if he had been transported to Elysian land, to the borders of the earth, where the easiest life is bestowed on people, where there is no snow and winter, nor storm and pouring rain, but always lets the gently cooling breath of Ocean rise and in the days pass in blissful leisure, effortlessly, without a fight and entirely dedicated to the sun and its festivals.","The comfortable rhythm of this life had already cast its spell over him; he was soon enticed by the ease, the mild splendour, of his programme. Indeed, what a place to be in, when the usual allurement of living in watering places on southern shores was coupled with the immediate nearness of the most wonderful of all cities! Aschenbach was not a lover of pleasure. Whenever that was some call for him to take a holiday, to indulge himself, to have a good time—and this was especially true at an earlier age— restlessness and repugnance soon drove him back to his rigorous toil, the faithful sober efforts of his daily routine. Except that this place was bewitching him, relaxing his will, making him happy. In the mornings, under the shelter of his bathing house, letting his eyes roam dreamily in the blue of the southern sea; or on a warm night as he leaned back against the cushions of the gondola carrying him under the broad starry sky home to the Lido from the Piazza di San Marco after long hours of idleness—and the brilliant lights, the melting notes of the serenade were being left behind—he often recalled his place in the mountains, the scene of his battles in the summer, where the clouds blew low across his garden, and terrifying storms put out the lamps at night, and the crows which he fed were swinging in the tops of the pine trees. Then everything seemed just right to him, as though he were lifted into the Elysian fields, on the borders of the earth, where man enjoys the easiest life, where there is no snow or winter, nor storms and pouring rains, but where Oceanus continually sends forth gentle cooling breezes, and the days pass in a blessed inactivity, without work, without effort, devoted wholly to the sun and to the feast days of the sun.","The soothing regularity of this existence quickly cast a spell over him: he was charmed by the soft, resplendent benignancy of it all. What a place indeed, combining as it did the appeal of a refined southern seaside resort with a strange, wondrous city in intimate proximity! Aschenbach did not care for pleasure. Whenever and wherever he was called upon to let his hair down, take things easy, enjoy himself, he soon—especially in his younger years—felt restless and ill at ease and could not wait to return to his noble travail, the sober sanctuary of his daily routine. It was the only place that could enchant him, relax his will, make him happy. There were times when in the morning, gazing dreamily at the blue of the southern sea from under the awning of his cabana, or on a halcyon night, reclining on the cushion of the gondola taking him home to the Lido from Saint Mark’s Square beneath the vast, starry firmament—the colorful lights, the mellifluous strains of the serenade fading into the distance—he would recall his house in the mountains, scene of his summer labors, where clouds drifted low through the garden, violent storms blew out the evening house lights, and the ravens, which he fed, soared to the tops of the spruces. Then he would feel he had indeed been whisked off to the land of Elysium, to the ends of the earth, where man is granted a life of ease, where there is no snow nor yet winter, no tempest, no pouring rain, but only the cool gentle breath released by Oceanus, and the days flow past in blissful idleness, effortless, free of strife, and consecrated solely to the sun and its feasts.","The comfortably constant rhythm of this existence had put him under its spell, and he was quickly captivated by the soft luxurious ease of his newfound way of life. And what a place it is that combines the charms of a cultivated Southern European seaside resort with the constant proximity of such a strange and wonderful city! Aschenbach was no great fun lover. Whenever and wherever it was necessary to stop working, recover his peace of mind and take a few days off, restlessness and dissatisfaction would soon compel him to resume his noble toil and devoutly austere daily routine. This had been especially true of him as a young man. Venice alone had enchanted him, relaxed his ambition and made him feel happy. There were times when he thought back: in the morning, as he sat before his hut in the shadow of the awning dreaming off into the blue of the southern sea, or on mild nights under the great starry sky, as he leaned back into the cushions of the gondola ferrying him home after a long evening on the Piazza, the bright lights and fluid melodies of serenades receding behind him. He thought back to his country house in the mountains, the site of his annual summer battles. He remembered the low drifting of the clouds over the yard, the power outages in the house after violent evening thunderstorms and the flight of the ravens he fed into the tops of the pines. And it seemed to him in such moments that he had been transported to Elysium, to the very end of the earth, where mortal men were blessed with lives of utmost ease, where, instead of snow and winter, storms and pounding rain, Oceanus forever blew his gentle cooling breath and the days trickled away in blissful indolence, effortlessly, without struggle, entirely given over to the sun and its rituals."
"Es war Anfang Mai und, nach naßkalten Wochen, ein falscher Hochsommer eingefallen. Der Englische Garten, obgleich nur erst zart belaubt, war dumpfig wie im August und in der Nähe der Stadt voller Wagen und Spaziergänger gewesen. Beim Aumeister, wohin stillere und stillere Wege ihn geführt, hatte Aschenbach eine kleine Weile den volkstümlich belebten Wirtsgarten überblickt, an dessen Rande einige Droschken und Equipagen hielten, hatte von dort bei sinkender Sonne seinen Heimweg außerhalb des Parks über die offene Flur genommen und erwartete, da er sich müde fühlte und über Föhring Gewitter drohte, am Nördlichen Friedhof die Tram, die ihn in gerader Linie zur Stadt zurückbringen sollte. Zufällig fand er den Halteplatz und seine Umgebung von Menschen leer. Weder auf der gepflasterten Ungererstraße, deren Schienengeleise sich einsam gleißend gegen Schwabing erstreckten, noch auf der Föhringer Chaussee war ein Fuhrwerk zu sehen; hinter den Zäunen der Steinmetzereien, wo zu Kauf stehende Kreuze, Gedächtnistafeln und Monumente ein zweites, unbehaustes Gräberfeld bilden, regte sich nichts, und das byzantinische Bauwerk der Aussegnungshalle gegenüber lag schweigend im Abglanz des scheidenden Tages. Ihre Stirnseite, mit griechischen Kreuzen und hieratischen Schildereien in lichten Farben geschmückt, weist überdies symmetrisch angeordnete Inschriften in Goldlettern auf, ausgewählte, das jenseitige Leben betreffende Schriftworte wie etwa: »Sie gehen ein in die Wohnung Gottes« oder: »Das ewige Licht leuchte ihnen«; und der Wartende hatte während einiger Minuten eine ernste Zerstreuung darin gefunden, die Formeln abzulesen und sein geistiges Auge in ihrer durchscheinenden Mystik sich verlieren zu lassen, als er, aus seinen Träumereien zurückkehrend, im Portikus, oberhalb der beiden apokalyptischen Tiere, welche die Freitreppe bewachen, einen Mann bemerkte, dessen nicht ganz gewöhnliche Erscheinung seinen Gedanken eine völlig andere Richtung gab.","It was early May and, after wet and cold weeks, a false midsummer had set in. The Englischer Garten, though only faintly leafy, was muggy as in August, and near town it was full of carriages and strollers. At the Aumeister, where quieter and quieter paths led him, Aschenbach had looked out for a little while at the popular inn garden, on the edge of which a few cabs and carriages were stopping, had taken his way home outside the park across the open field and expected since he felt tired and thunderstorms threatened over Föhring, the tram at the Northern Cemetery that was supposed to bring him back to town in a straight line. He happened to find the stopping place and its surroundings empty of people. There was no cart to be seen either on the paved Ungererstrasse, whose gleaming railroad tracks stretched lonely towards Schwabing, or on the Föhringer Chaussee; behind the fences of the stonemasons, where crosses, memorial plaques and monuments for sale form a second, uninhabited burial ground, nothing stirred, and the Byzantine building opposite the mortuary lay silent in the reflection of the departing day. Its front side, decorated with Greek crosses and hieratic signs in light colours, also shows symmetrically arranged inscriptions in gold letters, selected scriptural words relating to the afterlife, such as: ""You are entering the dwelling place of God"" or: ""The eternal light shine on you «; and the waiter had for a few minutes found a solemn distraction in reading the formulas and letting his mind's eye get lost in their translucent mysticism, when, returning from his reverie, he was in the portico, above the two apocalyptic beasts guarding the stairway , noticed a man whose not-so-ordinary appearance sent his thoughts in an entirely different direction.","It was the beginning of May, and after cold, damp weeks a false midsummer had set in. The English Gardens, although the foliage was still fresh and sparse, were as pungent as in August, and in the parts nearer the city had been full of conveyances and promenaders. At the Aumeister, which he had reached by quieter and quieter paths, Aschenbach had surveyed for a short time the Wirtsgarten with its lively crowds and its border of cabs and carriages. From here, as the sun was sinking, he had started home, outside the park, across the open fields; and since he felt tired and a storm was threatening from the direction of Föhring, he waited at the North Cemetery for the tram which would take him directly back to the city. It happened that he found no one in the station or its vicinity. There was not a vehicle to be seen, either on the paved Ungererstrasse, with its solitary glistening rails stretching out towards Schwabing, or on the Föhringer Chaussee. Behind the fences of the stone-masons' establishments, where the crosses, memorial tablets, and monuments standing for sale formed a second, uninhabited burial ground, there was no sign of life; and opposite him the Byzantine structure of the Funeral Hall lay silent in the reflection of the departing day; its façade, ornamented in luminous colours with Greek crosses and hieratic paintings, above which were displayed inscriptions symmetrically arranged in gold letters, and texts chosen to bear on the life beyond; such as, ""They enter into the dwelling of the Lord,"" or, ""The light of eternity shall shine upon them."" And for some time as he stood waiting he found a grave diversion in spelling out the formulas and letting his mind's eye lose itself in their transparent mysticism, when, returning from his reveries, he noticed in the portico, above the two apocalyptic animals guarding the steps, a man whose somewhat unusual appearance gave his thoughts an entirely new direction.","It was early May, and after a few cold, wet weeks a mock summer had set in. The Englischer Garten, though as yet in tender bud, was as muggy as in August and full of vehicles and pedestrians on the city side. At Aumeister, to which he had been led by ever more solitary paths, Aschenbach briefly scanned the crowded and lively open-air restaurant and the cabs and carriages along its edge, then, the sun beginning to sink, headed home across the open fields beyond the park, but feeling tired and noticing a storm brewing over Föhring, he stopped at the Northern Cemetery to wait for the tram that would take him straight back to town. As it happened, there was no one at the tram stop or thereabouts. Nor was any vehicle to be seen on the paved roadway of the Ungererstrasse—whose gleaming tracks stretched solitary in the direction of Schwabing—or on the road to Föhring. There was nothing stirring behind the stonemasons’ fences, where crosses, headstones, and monuments for sale formed a second, uninhabited graveyard, and the mortuary’s Byzantine structure opposite stood silent in the glow of the waning day. Its façade, decorated with Greek crosses and brightly hued hieratic patterns, also displayed a selection of symmetrically arranged gilt-lettered inscriptions concerning the afterlife, such as “They Enter into the Dwelling Place of the Lord” or “May the Light Everlasting Shine upon Them,” and reading the formulas, letting his mind’s eye lose itself in the mysticism emanating from them, served to distract the waiting man for several minutes until, resurfacing from his reveries, he noticed a figure in the portico above the two apocalyptic beasts guarding the staircase, and something slightly out of the ordinary in the figure’s appearance gave his thoughts an entirely new turn.","It was the beginning of May and after weeks of damp and cold, a false summer had set in. Though the leaves were hardly out, the Englischer Garten had nonetheless felt late-summer sultry, and its city end had been teeming with carriages and strollers. In front of the Aumeister, where paths of increasing solitude had led him, Aschenbach had paused a short while to survey the crowded restaurant garden, which had a few idle brougham cabs and equipages at its edge. Then, with the sun beginning to set, he had started home via the open field outside the park, stopping, on account of fatigue and storm clouds over Föhring, by the north cemetery to await the tram that would take him via the direct route back to the city. As it happened, the tram stop and surrounding area were deserted. Neither on the paved Ungererstraße, with its train tracks stretching solitary and gleaming toward Schwabing, nor on the old Föhringer Chaussee was a single vehicle to be seen. Nothing stirred behind the fences of those stonemasons’ yards where the crosses, headstones and other monuments on display make up a second, unoccupied graveyard. Across the way, the funeral chapel with its Byzantine architecture stood silently in the reflected light of the dying sun. To the fore, said chapel, which is decorated with Greek crosses and brightly colored hieratic ornamentation, bears symmetrically arranged inscriptions in gold lettering, selected biblical sayings concerning life in the afterworld, things like “They shall enter the house of God” or “May the Eternal Light suffuse them.” For some time the waiting Aschenbach had been deriving solemn pleasure in reading those formulae and allowing his mind’s eye to wander about in their shimmering mysticism, when, awakened from his dreamy musings, he noticed a man in the portico, above the pair of apocalyptic beasts that guard the outside stairs, a man whose not entirely everyday appearance turned his thoughts in a completely new direction."
phantastischem Aufwand kam in ihre Erscheinung einzig durch ihren,fantastic effort came into her appearance solely through her,"Except that her jewellery added something fantastically lavish to her appearance; indeed, it was almost priceless, and consisted of ear pendants and a very long triple chain of softly glowing pearls, as large as cherries.","The only aspect of her appearance evincing a certain fanciful sense of luxury was the jewelry, which was in fact nearly worthless and consisted of earrings plus a very long triple strand of gently shimmering pearls the size of cherries.","The only element of the extraordinary or the luxurious in her appearance was her jewelry, a pair of dangling earrings and three very long strands of gently shimmering pearls, as big as cherries, all of which were literally priceless."
"»Ein wenig«, antwortete der Mensch. »Nämlich durch Schuld einer kleinen Vernachlässigung, einer Indifferenz in äußerlichen Dingen, die bei bedeutenden Personen begreiflich ist, die man aber doch nicht unbedingt loben kann und zwar umso weniger, als gerade solchen Personen Vorurteile in Sachen des Natürlichen oder Künstlichen wenig angemessen sind. Würde sich die Sittenstrenge gewisser Leute gegenüber der kosmetischen Kunst logischerweise auch auf ihre Zähne erstrecken, so würden sie nicht wenig Anstoß erregen. Schließlich sind wir so alt, wie unser Geist, unser Herz sich fühlen, und graues Haar bedeutet unter Umständen eine wirklichere Unwahrheit, als die verschmähte Korrektur bedeuten würde. In Ihrem Falle, mein Herr, hat man ein Recht auf seine natürliche Haarfarbe. Sie erlauben mir, Ihnen die Ihrige einfach zurückzugeben?«","""A little,"" the human replied. “Namely through the fault of a little neglect, an indifference in external things, which is understandable in important people, but which one cannot necessarily praise, and all the less because such people have little appropriate prejudices in matters of the natural or artificial. If the rigor of certain people towards the art of cosmetics were logically extended to their teeth, they would cause no little offense. After all, we are as old as our minds, our hearts feel, and gray hair may mean a more real untruth than the scorned correction would mean. In your case, sir, you have a right to your natural hair color. Will you allow me to simply give you back yours?”","""A little,"" the man answered. ""Due entirely to a slight neglect, an indifference to outward things, which is conceivable in people of importance, but it is not exactly praiseworthy. And all the less so since such persons are above prejudice in matters of nature or art. If the moral objections of certain people to the art of cosmetics were to be logically extended to the care of the teeth, they would give no slight offence. And after all, we are just as old as we feel, and under some circumstances grey hair would actually stand for more of an untruth than the despised correction. In your case, sir, you are entitled to the natural colour of your hair. Will you permit me simply to return what belongs to you?""","“Slightly,” the fellow replied. “And all for a wee bit of negligence, a disregard for externals, which, understandable though it is in important personages, is not altogether commendable, especially as it is precisely those persons who should rise above such distinctions as ‘natural’ and ‘artificial.’ Were the strictures of certain individuals visà-vis the cosmetic art extended logically to include the teeth, the result would be more than a bit repellent. After all, we are only as old as we feel in our minds and hearts, and in certain circumstances gray hair can be more of an untruth than the disparaged corrective. A man like you, sir, has every right to his natural hair color. Will you permit me simply to restore to you what is yours?”","“A touch,” the man answered. “And where does the fault lie? A minor lapse, a neglect of external matters. Understandable, though hardly commendable, among persons of importance. Especially since they are precisely the ones who should be above little prejudices about what is natural and what is not. Some of these people and their moral objections to the art of cosmetics—if you extend the same logic to teeth, you see how offensive it is. Ultimately we are only as old as we feel in our hearts and minds. In certain cases keeping your hair gray actually involves more of a deception than the corrective some people see fit to scorn. A man in your position has a right to his natural hair color. Will you permit me simply to give you back what is yours?”"
"Mehrere Geschäfte weltlicher und literarischer Natur hielten den Reiselustigen noch etwa zwei Wochen nach jenem Spaziergang in München zurück. Er gab endlich Auftrag, sein Landhaus binnen vier Wochen zum Einzuge instandzusetzen und reiste an einem Tage zwischen Mitte und Ende des Mai mit dem Nachtzuge nach Triest, wo er nur vierundzwanzig Stunden verweilte und sich am nächstfolgenden Morgen nach Pola einschiffte. Was er suchte, war das Fremdartige und Bezuglose, welches jedoch rasch zu erreichen wäre, und so nahm er Aufenthalt auf einer seit einigen Jahren gerühmten Insel der Adria, unfern der istrischen Küste gelegen, mit farbig zerlumptem, in wildfremden Lauten redendem Landvolk und schön zerrissenen Klippenpartien dort, wo das Meer offen war. Allein Regen und schwere Luft, eine kleinweltliche, geschlossen österreichische Hotelgesellschaft und der Mangel jenes ruhevoll innigen Verhältnisses zum Meere, das nur ein sanfter, sandiger Strand gewährt, verdrossen ihn, ließen ihn nicht das Bewußtsein gewinnen, den Ort seiner Bestimmung getroffen zu haben; ein Zug seines Innern, ihm war noch nicht deutlich, wohin, beunruhigte ihn, er studierte Schiffsverbindungen, er blickte suchend umher, und auf einmal, zugleich überraschend und selbstverständlich, stand ihm sein Ziel vor Augen. Wenn man über Nacht das Unvergleichliche, das märchenhaft Abweichende zu erreichen wünschte, wohin ging man? Aber das war klar. Was sollte er hier? Er war fehlgegangen. Dorthin hatte er reisen wollen. Er säumte nicht, den irrigen Aufenthalt zu kündigen. Anderthalb Wochen nach seiner Ankunft auf der Insel trug ein geschwindes Motorboot ihn und sein Gepäck in dunstiger Frühe über die Wasser in den Kriegshafen zurück, und er ging dort nur an Land, um sogleich über einen Brettersteg das feuchte Verdeck eines Schiffes zu beschreiten, das unter Dampf zur Fahrt nach Venedig lag.","Several business of a secular and literary nature kept the travel enthusiast about two weeks after that walk in Munich. He finally gave the order to prepare his country house within four weeks for moving in and traveled one day between the middle and the end of May by night train to Trieste, where he stayed only twenty-four hours and embarked for Pola the next morning. What he was looking for was something strange and unrelated, which, however, could be reached quickly, and so he stayed on an island in the Adriatic, which had been famous for a few years, not far from the Istrian coast, with colorfully ragged country folk talking in strange sounds and beautifully torn Cliffs where the sea was open. But rain and heavy air, a petty-worldly, closed Austrian hotel company and the lack of that peaceful, intimate relationship with the sea that only a gentle, sandy beach affords, vexed him and made him unaware that he had found the place of his destiny; an inner trait, he wasn't yet sure where to go, worried him, he studied ship connections, he looked around searchingly, and suddenly, surprisingly and naturally, his goal stood before his eyes. If one wished to achieve the incomparable, the fabulously different overnight, where did one go? But that was clear. What was he doing here? He had failed. That's where he'd wanted to go. He did not delay in announcing the erroneous stay. A week and a half after his arrival on the island, a fast motorboat carried him and his luggage back across the water to the naval port in the hazy morning, and he only went ashore there to immediately step onto the damp deck of a ship that was sinking via a boardwalk steam for the trip to Venice.","Various matters of a literary and social nature delayed his departure until about two weeks after that walk in Munich. Finally he gave orders to have his country house ready for occupancy within a month; and one day between the middle and the end of May he took the night train for Trieste, where he made a stop-over of only twenty-four hours, and embarked the following morning for Pola. What he was hunting was something foreign and unrelated to himself which would at the same time be quickly within reach; and so he stopped at an island in the Adriatic which had become well-known in recent years. It lay not far off the Istrian coast, with beautifully rugged cliffs fronting the open sea, and natives who dressed in variegated tatters and made strange sounds when they spoke. But rain and a heavy atmosphere, a provincial and exclusively Austrian patronage at the hotel, and the lack of that restfully intimate association with the sea which can be gotten only by a soft, sandy beach, irritated him, and prevented him from feeling that he had found the place he was looking for. Something within was disturbing him, and drawing him he was not sure where. He studied sailing dates, he looked about him questioningly, and of a sudden, as a thing both astounding and self-evident, his goal was before him. If you wanted to reach over night the unique, the fabulously different, where did you go? But that was plain. What was he doing here? He had lost the trail. He had wanted to go there. He did not delay in giving notice of his mistake in stopping here. In the early morning mist, a week and a half after his arrival on the island, a fast motorboat was carrying him and his luggage back over the water to the naval port, and he landed there just long enough to cross the gangplank to the damp deck of a ship which was lying under steam ready for the voyage to Venice.","Several matters of a mundane and literary nature kept him in Munich for approximately a fortnight after that walk, eager though he was to be on his way, but at last he gave orders for his country house to be made ready for occupancy within four weeks, and on a day between mid and late May he set off by night train for Trieste, where he tarried only twenty-four hours, boarding the ship for Pola the next morning. What he sought was something exotic and distinctive yet of easy access, and so he stopped at an island in the Adriatic, not far from the coast of Istria, one that had acquired a following in recent years and featured colorful raggle-taggle rustics speaking an outlandish tongue and beautifully jagged cliffs facing the open sea. But rain, a heavy atmosphere, the provincial closed society of the Austrian hotel guests, and the lack of a peaceful, intimate rapport with the sea that only a soft, sandy beach can provide had soured him and kept him from feeling he had found his final destination. He was troubled by an impulse to go he knew not quite where, and he was studying the ships’ timetables and looking hither and yon when all at once his goal, surprising yet at the same time self-evident, stared him in the face. Where did one go when one wished to travel overnight to a unique, fairy-tale-like location? Why, that was obvious. What was he doing here? He had come to the wrong place. That is where he should have gone. He lost no time in announcing his departure. A week and a half after his arrival on the island a swift motorboat bore him and his luggage across the misty morning water back to the naval base and he disembarked only to mount a gangplank leading to the damp deck of a steamer about to weigh anchor for Venice.","Several matters, literary and practical, kept the eager traveler in Munich for an additional fortnight after that fateful walk. He finally ordered that his country house be made ready for habitation within four weeks’ time and departed one day between the middle and the end of May, taking the night train to Trieste, where he delayed only twenty-four hours before embarking for Pola the following morning. He was looking for something exotic and disconnected, but within quick reach, so he took up residence on an Adriatic island not far from the Istrian coast, highly praised of late, with natives in colorful rags babbling wild sounds and beautiful sets of jagged cliffs wherever there was access to the sea. But the rain, the humidity, a self-contained hotel clientele of provincial Austrians and the lack of that peacefully intimate contact with the sea which only a soft, sandy beach can provide conspired to oppress his mood and never allowed him to feel as though he had found the place he was meant to be. Some impulse within—toward what he didn’t know—made him restless. He began studying ship schedules and inquiring around when, suddenly, the surprising but obvious destination materialized before his eyes. Where did you go when you wanted to arrive, overnight, somewhere incomparable, somewhere fairy tale–like and exotic? It was clear as day. What was he doing here? He’d gotten off track. He’d wanted to go there all along. He wasted no time canceling his ill-made reservations. A week and a half after his arrival on the island a speedy motorboat was carrying him through the early morning mists back to that wartime harbor. He only stepped foot on land long enough to walk up the gangplank onto the damp deck of a passenger ship waiting under steam to depart for Venice."
"Mandoline, Guitarre, Harmonika und eine quinkelierende Geige waren unter den Händen der Bettelvirtuosen in Tätigkeit. Mit instrumentalen Durchführungen wechselten Gesangsnummern, wie denn das jüngere der Weiber, scharf und quäkend von Stimme, sich mit dem süß falsettierenden Tenor zu einem verlangenden Liebesduett zusammentat. Aber als das eigentliche Talent und Haupt der Vereinigung zeigte sich unzweideutig der andere der Männer, Inhaber der Guitarre und im Charakter eine Art Baryton-Buffo, fast ohne Stimme dabei, aber mimisch begabt und von bemerkenswerter komischer Energie. Oftmals löste er sich, sein großes Instrument im Arm, von der Gruppe der anderen los und drang agierend gegen die Rampe vor, wo man seine Eulenspiegeleien mit aufmunterndem Lachen belohnte. Namentlich die Russen, in ihrem Parterre, zeigten sich entzückt über soviel südliche Beweglichkeit und ermutigten ihn durch Beifall und Zurufe, immer kecker und sicherer aus sich heraus zu gehen.","Mandolin, guitar, accordion, and a quacking violin were at work in the hands of the mendicant virtuosos. Singing numbers alternated with instrumental developments, as the younger of the women, with a sharp and squeaky voice, teamed up with the sweetly falsetto tenor in a demanding love duet. But the real talent and head of the union was unequivocally shown to be the other of the men, the owner of the guitar and a kind of baryton buffo in character, almost without a voice, but gifted in mimicry and of remarkable comic energy. Often he broke away from the group of others, his large instrument in his arm, and actively pushed forward towards the ramp, where his quibbling was rewarded with encouraging laughter. The Russians in particular, on their ground floor, were delighted with so much southern mobility and encouraged him with applause and shouts to be more bold and self-assured.","Mandolin, guitar, harmonica, and a squeaky violin were responding to the touch of the virtuoso beggars. Instrumental numbers alternated with songs, as when the younger of the women, with a sharp trembling voice, joined with the sweetly falsetto tenor in a languishing love duet. But the real talent and leader of the group was undoubtedly the other of the two men, the one with the guitar. He was a kind of buffo baritone, with not much of a voice, although he did have a gift for pantomime, and a remarkable comic energy. Often, with his large instrument under his arm, he would leave the rest of the group and, still acting, would intrude on the platform, where his antics were rewarded with encouraging laughter. Especially the Russians in their seats down front seemed to be enchanted with so much southern mobility, and their applause incited him to let himself out more and more boldly and assertively.","Mandolin, guitar, accordion, and squeaky fiddle soon came to life under the fingers of the beggar virtuosi. Instrumental pieces alternated with vocal numbers, one of which featured the younger of the women with her harsh rasp of a voice and the tenor’s sugary falsetto in a passionate love duet. But the true talent and leader of the ensemble was unequivocally the other man—the one with the guitar and a kind of baritone-buffo character—who, though he had no voice to speak of, was a gifted mime and possessed of remarkable comic energy. He often broke away from the group, his large instrument in tow, and made his way forward, where his highjinks were rewarded with laughter and encouragement. The Russians in their front-row seats took particular pleasure in so much southern vivacity and exhorted him, clapping and cheering, to ever bolder and brasher antics.","Mandolin, guitar, harmonica and a squawking violin began to sound under the hands of the busker virtuosi. Vocal numbers alternated with elaborate instrumentals, the younger woman, for instance, lending her sharp squeak to the tenor’s sweet falsetto in a searching love ballad. The main talent and leader of the ensemble, however, proved to be without doubt the other man, the one with the guitar, a baritone-buffo of a character. He had hardly any voice at all but was a highly skilled mimic and possessed a remarkable comic energy. Often he would detach himself from the others, his giant instrument in his arms, to advance demonstratively toward the sloping terrace wall, where his machinations were rewarded with encouraging laughter. Particularly the Russians in their orchestra seats showed delight at such displays of Mediterranean inventiveness, bolstering his courage and self-confidence with applause and shouts, urging him on to make an even greater spectacle of himself."
"Nun lenkte Tag für Tag der Gott mit den hitzigen Wangen nackend sein gluthauchendes Viergespann durch die Räume des Himmels und sein gelbes Gelock flatterte im zugleich ausstürmenden Ostwind. Weißlich seidiger Glanz lag auf den Weiten des träge wallenden Pontos. Der Sand glühte. Unter der silbrig flirrenden Bläue des Äthers waren rostfarbene Segeltücher vor den Strandhütten ausgespannt, und auf dem scharf umgrenzten Schattenfleck, den sie boten, verbrachte man die Vormittagsstunden. Aber köstlich war auch der Abend, wenn die Pflanzen des Parks balsamisch dufteten, die Gestirne droben ihren Reigen schritten und das Murmeln des umnachteten Meeres, leise heraufdringend, die Seele besprach. Solch ein Abend trug in sich die freudige Gewähr eines neuen Sonnentages von leicht geordneter Muße und geschmückt mit zahllosen, dicht beieinander liegenden Möglichkeiten lieblichen Zufalls.","Day after day the naked god with the hot cheeks steered his glowing four-horse chariot through the spaces of heaven and his yellow locks fluttered in the simultaneously rushing east wind. A whitish, silky sheen lay on the expanses of the lazily undulating Pontus. The sand glowed. Rust-colored sailcloths were stretched out in front of the beach huts under the silvery, shimmering blue of the ether, and the morning hours were spent on the sharply defined patch of shade they offered. But the evening was delicious, too, when the plants in the park gave off a balmy scent, the stars danced overhead and the murmur of the darkened sea softly pierced the surface and soothed the soul. Such an evening carried within itself the joyful guarantee of a new sunny day of easily ordered leisure and adorned with countless close-knit possibilities of lovely chance.","Day after day now the naked god with the hot cheeks drove his fire-breathing quadriga across the expanses of the sky, and his yellow locks fluttered in the assault of the east wind. A white silk sheen stretched over the slowly simmering Ponto. The sand glowed. Beneath the quaking silver blue of the ether rust-coloured canvasses were spread in front of the beach bathing houses, and the afternoons were spent in the sharply demarcated spots of shade which they cast. But it was also delightful in the evening, when the vegetation in the park had the smell of balsam, and the stars were working through their courses above, and the soft persistent murmur of the sea came up enchantingly through the night. Such evenings contained the cheering promise that more sunny days of casual idleness would follow, dotted with countless closely interspersed possibilities of well-timed accidents.","Day after day now the god with the flaming cheeks soared upward naked, driving his team of four fire-breathing horses through heaven’s acres, his yellow ringlets fluttering wild in the gale of the east wind. A silky white sheen overlay the expanse of slow-swelling Pontos. The sand fairly glowed. Beneath the quivering silvery blue of the ether, rust-colored canvas awnings jutted out before each cabana, and mornings were spent on the sharply outlined patch of shade they created. But evenings were lovely as well, the plants in the park exuding their balm, the heavenly bodies dancing their round, the soft sighs of the night-shrouded sea rising up, casting spells on the soul. Evenings like these bore the joyful promise of a new sunny day of loosely ordered leisure and ornamented with countless and closely packed prospects of pleasant encounters.","Every day now, the bare-skinned, fiery-cheeked god piloted his heat-breathing chariot across the sky’s expanse, his golden locks waving in the simultaneously storming east wind. Silky white radiance hung over the slow swells of the pontos. The sand was glowing hot. Before the changing huts, rust-colored canvas awnings were unfurled beneath the silvery glimmering blue of the ether, and the morning hours were passed in the sharply defined patches of shade they provided. Exquisite, too, was the night, when the park flora gave off soothing fragrances, the stars above danced in lines and the softly insistent murmur of the darkened sea conjured over the soul. Each evening contained the joyful promise of another sunny day of easily disposed leisure, a day made more attractive still by sweet fortune’s dense and infinite assortment of possibilities."
"Sein Schlaf war flüchtig; die köstlich einförmigen Tage waren getrennt durch kurze Nächte voll glücklicher Unruhe. Zwar zog er sich zeitig zurück, denn um neun Uhr, wenn Tadzio vom Schauplatz verschwunden war, schien der Tag ihm beendet. Aber ums erste Morgengrauen weckte ihn ein zart durchdringendes Erschrecken, sein Herz erinnerte sich seines Abenteuers, es litt ihn nicht mehr in den Kissen, er erhob sich, und leicht eingehüllt gegen die Schauer der Frühe setzte er sich ans offene Fenster, den Aufgang der Sonne zu erwarten. Das wundervolle Ereignis erfüllte seine vom Schlafe geweihte Seele mit Andacht. Noch lagen Himmel, Erde und Meer in geisterhaft glasiger Dämmerblässe; noch schwamm ein vergehender Stern im Wesenlosen. Aber ein Wehen kam, eine beschwingte Kunde von unnahbaren Wohnplätzen, daß Eos sich von der Seite des Gatten erhebe, und jenes erste, süße Erröten der fernsten Himmels-und Meeresstriche geschah, durch welches das Sinnlichwerden der Schöpfung sich anzeigt. Die Göttin nahte, die Jünglingsentführerin, die den Kleitos, den Kephalos raubte und dem Neide aller Olympischen trotzend die Liebe des schönen Orion genoß. Ein Rosenstreuen begann da am Rande der Welt, ein unsäglich holdes Scheinen und Blühen, kindliche Wolken, verklärt, durchleuchtet, schwebten gleich dienenden Amoretten im rosigen, bläulichen Duft, Purpur fiel auf das Meer, das ihn wallend vorwärts zu schwemmen schien, goldene Speere zuckten von unten zur Höhe des Himmels hinauf, der Glanz ward zum Brande, lautlos, mit göttlicher Übergewalt wälzten sich Glut und Brunst und lodernde Flammen herauf, und mit raffenden Hufen stiegen des Bruders heilige Renner über den Erdkreis empor. Angestrahlt von der Pracht des Gottes saß der Einsam-Wache, er schloß die Augen und ließ von der Glorie seine Lider küssen. Ehemalige Gefühle, frühe, köstliche Drangsale des Herzens, die im strengen Dienst seines Lebens erstorben waren und nun so sonderbar gewandelt zurückkehrten,—er erkannte sie mit verwirrtem, verwundertem Lächeln. Er sann, er träumte, langsam bildeten seine Lippen einen Namen, und noch immer lächelnd, mit aufwärts gekehrtem Antlitz, die Hände im Schöße gefaltet, entschlummerte er in seinem Sessel noch einmal.","His sleep was fleeting; the deliciously monotonous days were separated by short nights of happy restlessness. It is true that he withdrew early, because at nine o'clock, when Tadzio had disappeared from the scene, the day seemed over to him. But at dawn he was awakened by a delicate, penetrating shock, his heart remembered his adventure, he could no longer bear his pillows, he got up, and lightly wrapped up against the shivers of the early morning, he sat down at the open window, watching the sun rise expected. The wondrous event filled his sleep-consecrated soul with devotion. Sky, earth and sea still lay in a ghostly glassy twilight pallor; a dying star was still swimming in the unsubstantial. But a breath came, a buoyant tiding of unapproachable dwelling places, that Eos was rising from the husband's side, and that first, sweet blushing of the farthest reaches of heaven and sea occurred, through which the sensuality of creation is indicated. The goddess approached, the kidnapper who kidnapped Cleitos and Cephalos and, despite the envy of all Olympians, enjoyed the love of the beautiful Orion. A scattering of roses began there at the edge of the world, an inexpressibly lovely shining and blooming, childlike clouds, transfigured, illuminated, hovered like serving cupids in the rosy, bluish scent, crimson fell on the sea, which seemed to be undulating to wash him forward, golden spears twitched from below up to the heights of heaven, the shine became a fire, silently, with divine might, fervor and blazing flames rolled up, and with clawing hooves the brother's holy racers climbed up over the world. Illuminated by the splendor of the god, the lonely guard sat, he closed his eyes and let the glory kiss his lids. Former feelings, early, delicious tribulations of the heart, which had died away in the rigorous service of his life and now returned so strangely changed—he recognized them with a bewildered, astonished smile. He thought, he dreamed, slowly his lips formed a name, and still smiling, face upturned, hands folded in his lap, he fell asleep once more in his chair.","His sleep was fitful; the preciously uniform days were separated by short nights of happy unrest. He did retire early, for at nine o'clock, when Tadzio had disappeared from the scene, the day seemed over. But at the first grey of dawn he was awakened by a gently insistent shock; he suddenly remembered his adventure, he could no longer remain in bed; he arose, and clad lightly against the chill of morning, he sat down by the open window to await the rising of the sun. Revived by his sleep, he watched this miraculous event with reverence. Sky, earth, and sea still lay in glassy, ghost-like twilight; a dying star still floated in the emptiness of space But a breeze started up, a winged message from habitations beyond reach, telling that Eros was rising from beside her husband. And that first sweet reddening in the farthest stretches of sky and sea took place by which the sentiency of creation is announced. The goddess was approaching, the seductress of youth who stole Cleitus and Cephalus, and despite the envy of all the Olympians enjoyed the love of handsome Orion. A strewing of roses began there on the edge of the world, an unutterably pure glowing and blooming. Childish clouds, lighted and shined through, floated like busy little Cupids in the rosy, bluish mist. Purple fell upon the sea, which seemed to be simmering, and washing the colour towards him. Golden spears shot up into the sky from behind. The splendour caught fire, silently, and with godlike power an intense flame of licking tongues broke out—and with rattling hoofs the brother's sacred chargers mounted the horizon. Lighted by the god's brilliance, he sat there, keeping watch alone. He closed his eyes, letting this glory play against the lids. Past emotions, precious early afflictions and yearnings which had been stifled by his rigorous programme of living, were now returning in such strange new forms. With an embarrassed, astonished smile, he recognized them. He was thinking, dreaming; slowly his lips formed a name. And still smiling, with his face turned upwards, hands folded in his lap, he fell asleep again in his chair.","He slept fitfully, the delightfully uniform days separated by brief, agreeably restless nights. True, he would retire early, because at nine, when Tadzio disappeared from the scene, the day seemed over to him, but at the first hint of dawn he would be awakened by a sweet panic, his heart would recall its adventure, and, finding it impossible to remain in bed, he would rise and, lightly clad against the morning chill, await the sunrise at the open window. This wondrous event would fill his soul, exalted yet from sleep, with great awe. Sky, earth, and sea still lay in the ghostly, glassy pallor of dawn; a fading star still hovered in the insubstantial heights. But a wind would waft in, a sprightly herald from abodes inaccessible to man, to say that Eos was rising from her husband’s side, and then came that first sweet blush of the remotest stretches of sky and sea, presaging the Creation’s reappearance to the senses. It was the goddess approaching, the seductress of youths, who had carried off Cleitus and Cephalus and, defying the envy of all Olympus, enjoyed the love of the beautiful Orion. At the edge of the world there was a strewing of roses, an ineffably beautiful shining and flowering, there were childlike clouds, transfigured, translucent, floating like attending amoretti in the rosy-blue haze, and a crimson radiance fell upon the sea, its rolling waves seeming to drive it forward, and golden spears flashed from below to the heavenly heights, the gleam turning to fire, soundlessly, the glow and heat and blazing flames billowing skyward with godlike potency, as the sacred steeds of her brother rose with grappling hooves over the planet. Illumined by the god’s splendor, Aschenbach, alone and awake, would shut his eyes and let his eyelids be kissed by the aura. Emotions from the past, early, delightful dolors of the heart swallowed up by the strict discipline of his life were now reappearing in the strangest of permutations—he recognized them with a perplexed and puzzled smile. He mused, he dreamed, his lips slowly shaping a name, and, still smiling, his face uplifted, his hands folded in his lap, he would doze off again in his armchair.","He slept in short bursts, his exquisitely uniform days broken up by short nights of happy restlessness. Although he always retired early—for him, the day seemed over by nine o’clock, when Tadzio disappeared—he awoke suddenly, as though from a light shock, at the break of dawn. His heart recalled its ongoing adventure, it drove him from his pillows, and he got up, wrapped in a light robe against the morning chill, to sit by his open window waiting for sunrise. That miraculous event filled his soul, still solemn from sleep, with pious reverence. Sky, earth and sea lay motionless behind a ghostly, glassy pale; one dying star still floated visible against the void. Then a breeze came up, a giddy harbinger from unapproachable domains, announcing Eos’ imminent rise from her husband’s side, and that first sweet blush of the furthest stretches of sea and sky began, indicating that things were to become knowable to the senses. The goddess approached, that seductress of young men, that thief of Cleitus and Cephalus, who, braving the envy of all Olympus, had reveled in the love of beautiful Orion. Roses were strewn at the edge of the world. There was a shining and blossoming too fair for words. Infant clouds, transfigured and illuminated, hovered like attending amoretti in the pinkish blue haze. Crimson descended over the sea, whose waves seemed to wash it shoreward. Golden spears shot from below toward the highest reaches of heaven, their radiance igniting. Silent, driven by a superior force of divinity, heat and fire and burning flames surged upward, and the heavenly coursers of brother Apollo tucked their hooves and ascended over the surface of the earth. Basking in the god’s splendor, Aschenbach sat alone and awake, his eyes shut, letting glory kiss his lids. Emotions once felt—precious heartaches from the past that had perished before his life’s strict sense of duty—now returned, strangely transformed. He recognized them with a smile of confusion and astonishment. He pondered, he daydreamed, slowly a name formed on his lips, and, still smiling, with his face upturned and his hands folded in his lap, he fell asleep again in his armchair."
"Wie dem auch sei! Eine Entwicklung ist ein Schicksal; und wie sollte nicht diejenige anders verlaufen, die von der Teilnahme, dem Massenzutrauen einer weiten Öffentlichkeit begleitet wird, als jene, die sich ohne den Glanz und die Verbindlichkeiten des Ruhmes vollzieht? Nur ewiges Zigeunertum findet es langweilig und ist zu spotten geneigt, wenn ein großes Talent dem libertinischen Puppenstande entwächst, die Würde des Geistes ausdrucksvoll wahrzunehmen sich gewöhnt und die Hofsitten einer Einsamkeit annimmt, die voll unberatener, hart selbständiger Leiden und Kämpfe war und es zu Macht und Ehren unter den Menschen brachte. Wieviel Spiel, Trotz, Genuß ist übrigens in der Selbstgestaltung des Talentes! Etwas Amtlich-Erzieherisches trat mit der Zeit in Gustav Aschenbachs Vorführungen ein, sein Stil entriet in späteren Jahren der unmittelbaren Kühnheiten, der subtilen und neuen Abschattungen, er wandelte sich ins Mustergültig-Feststehende, Geschliffen-Herkömmliche, Erhaltende, Formelle, selbst Formelhafte, und wie die Überlieferung es von Ludwig dem Vierzehnten wissen will, so verbannte der Alternde aus seiner Sprachweise jedes gemeine Wort: Damals geschah es, daß die Unterrichtsbehörde ausgewählte Seiten von ihm in die vorgeschriebenen Schullesebücher übernahm. Es war ihm innerlich gemäß, und er lehnte nicht ab, als ein deutscher Fürst, soeben zum Throne gelangt, dem Dichter des »Friedrich« zu seinem fünfzigsten Geburtstag den persönlichen Adel verlieh.","Anyway! A development is a destiny; and how should that which is accompanied by the participation, the mass confidence of a wide public, not be different from that which takes place without the splendor and obligations of fame? Only eternal gypsyism finds it boring and is inclined to scoff when a great talent outgrows the libertine puppet status, becomes accustomed to expressively perceiving the dignity of the spirit and adopts the court customs of a loneliness, which was full of unadvised, hard independent suffering and struggles and made it to power and honors among men. Incidentally, how much play, defiance, and enjoyment there is in the self-creation of talent! Over time, something official and educational entered Gustav Aschenbach's performances, in later years his style eschewed direct boldness, subtle and new shades, it changed into the exemplary-fixed, polished-conventional, preserving, formal, even As tradition has it, Louis the fourteenth banished every common word from his way of speaking when he got older. It was then that the educational authorities included selected pages from him in the prescribed school textbooks. Inwardly it suited him, and he did not refuse when a German prince, who had just ascended the throne, conferred personal nobility on the poet of Friedrich on his fiftieth birthday.","Be that as it may. An evolution is a destiny; and why should his evolution, which had been upheld by the general confidence of a vast public, not run through a different course from one accomplished outside the lustre and the entanglements of fame? Only chronic vagabondage will find it tedious and be inclined to scoff when a great talent outgrows the libertine chrysalis-stage, learns to seize upon and express the dignity of the mind, and superimposes a formal etiquette upon a solitude which had been filled with unchastened and rigidly isolated sufferings and struggles and had brought all this to a point of power and honour among men. Further, how much sport, defiance, indulgence there is in the self-formation of a talent! Gradually something official, didactic crept into Gustav Aschenbach's productions, his style in later life fought shy of any abruptness and boldness, any subtle and unexpected contrasts; he inclined towards the fixed and standardized, the conventionally elegant, the conservative, the formal, the formulated, nearly. And, as is traditionally said of Louis XIV, with the advancing years he came to omit every common word from his vocabulary. At about this time it happened that the educational authorities included selected pages by him in their prescribed school readers. This was deeply sympathetic to his nature, and he did not decline when a German prince who had just mounted to the throne raised the author of the Frederick to nobility on the occasion of his fiftieth birthday.","Is it not moral and immoral at once—moral as the outcome and expression of discipline, yet immoral, even antimoral, insofar as it is by its very nature indifferent to morality, indeed, strives to bend morality beneath its proud and absolute scepter? Be that as it may, development is destiny, and should it not take one course if lacking in the glamour and obligations of fame and another if attended by the interest and trust of a broad audience? Only incorrigible bohemians find it boring or laughable when a man of talent outgrows the libertine chrysalis stage and begins to perceive and express the dignity of the intellect, adopting the courtly ways of a solitude replete with bitter suffering and inner battles though eventually gaining a position of power and honor among men. And what sport, what bravado, what pleasure there is in fashioning one’s own talent! As time progressed, Gustav Aschenbach’s creations took on an official, didactic tone: in later years his style lost its brashness, its fresh, subtle nuances; it became fixed and exemplary, polished and conventional, conservative, formal, even formulaic, with the result that the aging man—like Louis XIV, if we are to believe tradition—banned all prosaic words from his vocabulary. It was then that school officials began including selected passages from his works in the textbooks they prescribed. He found it only fitting that a German prince who had just ascended the throne should confer nobility upon the author of Frederick on his fiftieth birthday, and he did not decline the honor.","Be that as it may. Development is destiny—and how could one unfolding to the applause and mass faith of a broad popular audience not be different from one transpiring without the luster and gratitudes of fame? Only the eternal vagabond yawns and tries to scoff when a great talent outgrows its libertinistic incubation period, expressly affiliates itself with the dignity of the human imagination and claims the court privileges attending a lonely existence full of solitary, unshared suffering in battle, which has brought societal influence and accolades. How much playfulness, spite and sheer pleasure is there anyway in talent in its formative stages? With time, something official, pedagogical, crept into the public Gustav Aschenbach. His style dispensed in later years with boldfaced audacities, subtle and original nuances, to become paradigmatic and solid, polished and familiar, conservative, formal, even formulaic. Moreover, like the Louis XIV of historical record, the older he got, the more he purged his vocabulary of words with vulgar associations. At this point it happened that the ministry of education adopted select passages from his work as mandatory school reading. His own inner sense of himself was confirmed—and he did not demur—when a newly crowned German prince wished to honor the creator of Frederick by bestowing upon him, on the occasion of his fiftieth birthday, the title of personal nobility."
"Zum zweitenmal und nun endgültig war es erwiesen, daß diese Stadt bei dieser Witterung ihm höchst schädlich war. Eigensinniges Ausharren erschien vernunftwidrig, die Aussicht auf ein Umschlagen des Windes ganz ungewiß. Es galt rasche Entscheidung. Schon jetzt nach Hause zurückzukehren, verbot sich. Weder Sommer-noch Winterquartier war bereit, ihn aufzunehmen. Aber nicht nur hier gab es Meer und Strand, und anderwärts fanden sie sich ohne die böse Zutat der Lagune und ihres Fieberdunstes. Er erinnerte sich eines kleinen Seebades nicht weit von Triest, das man ihm rühmlich genannt hatte. Warum nicht dorthin? Und zwar ohne Verzug, damit der abermalige Aufenthaltswechsel sich noch lohne. Er erklärte sich für entschlossen und stand auf. Am nächsten Gondelhalteplatz nahm er ein Fahrzeug und ließ sich durch das trübe Labyrinth der Kanäle, unter zierlichen Marmorbalkonen hin, die von Löwenbildern flankiert waren, um glitschige Mauerecken, vorbei an trauernden Palastfassaden, die große Firmenschilder im Abfall schaukelnden Wasser spiegelten, nach San Marco leiten. Er hatte Mühe, dorthin zu gelangen, denn der Gondolier, der mit Spitzenfabriken und Glasbläsereien im Bunde stand, versuchte überall, ihn zu Besichtigung und Einkauf abzusetzen, und wenn die bizarre Fahrt durch Venedig ihren Zauber zu üben begann, so tat der beutelschneiderische Geschäftsgeist der gesunkenen Königin das seine, den Sinn wieder verdrießlich zu ernüchtern.","For the second time and now finally it was proven that this city was extremely harmful to him in this weather. Willful perseverance seemed irrational, the prospect of a turning tide quite uncertain. It was a quick decision. Going home now was out of the question. Neither summer nor winter quarters were prepared to take him in. But it was not only here that there was sea and sand, and elsewhere they found themselves without the evil ingredient of the lagoon and its feverish haze. He remembered a small seaside resort not far from Trieste, which had been praised to him. Why not there? And without delay, so that the repeated change of residence is still worthwhile. He declared himself determined and got up. At the nearest gondola stop he took a vehicle and let himself be guided through the murky labyrinth of canals, beneath dainty marble balconies flanked by images of lions, around slippery wall corners, past mourning palace facades that reflected large company signs in the refuse swaying water, to San Marco . He had trouble getting there, for the gondolier, associated with lace factories and glass-blowing workshops, tried everywhere to drop him off for sightseeing and shopping, and when the bizarre journey through Venice began to work its magic, so did the bag-cutting commercial spirit of sunken queen his own, to sober up the mood again sulkily.","For the second and last time it had been demonstrated that this city in this kind of weather was decidedly unhealthy for him. It seemed foolish to attempt a stubborn resistance, while the prospects for a change of wind were completely uncertain. A quick decision was called for. It was not possible to go home this soon. Neither summer nor winter quarters were prepared to receive him. But this was not the only place where there were sea and beach; and elsewhere these could be found without the lagoon and its malarial mists. He remembered a little watering place not far from Trieste which had been praised to him. Why not there? And without delay, so that this new change of location would still have time to do him some good. He pronounced this as good as settled, and stood up. At the next gondola station he took a boat back to San Marco, and was led through the dreary labyrinth of canals, under fancy marble balconies flanked with lions, around the corners of smooth walls, past the sorrowing façades of palaces which mirrored large dilapidated business-signs in the pulsing water. He had trouble arriving there, for the gondolier, who was in league with lace-makers and glass-blowers, was always trying to land him for inspections and purchases; and just as the bizarre trip through Venice would begin to cast its spell, the greedy business sense of the sunken Queen did all it could to destroy the illusion.","For the second time—and this time definitively—the city had proved itself extremely harmful to him in such weather. Braving it out obstinately seemed unreasonable, the prospect of a shift in the wind being quite uncertain. An immediate decision was of the essence. Returning home was out of the question at this point: neither his summer nor his winter quarters were ready. But this was not the only place with sea and sand, and elsewhere they were to be had without the nefarious admixture of the lagoon and its feverous vapors. He recalled having heard the praises of a small seaside resort not far from Trieste. Why not go there? And without delay, to make the move to yet another locale worth the effort. He rose, resolute, to his feet. At the next gondola stop he boarded a boat and was rowed through the murky labyrinth of the canals under graceful marble balconies flanked by carved lions, around corners of slimy masonry, past funereal palazzo façades, their large commercial signs mirrored in the bobbing water strewn with refuse, and on to San Marco. He had some difficulty getting there, because the gondolier, in league as he was with the lace factories and glass works, kept trying to stop so he might view and purchase their wares, and whenever the bizarre journey through Venice began to cast its spell upon him the cutpurse mercantilism of the sunken queen did its part to bring him painfully back to his senses.","Twice, and now definitively, it had been demonstrated that this city could be quite harmful to him in this weather. Obstinately sticking it out seemed irrational—there was no guarantee the wind would shift. A quick decision was required. To go home so soon was out of the question. Neither his summer nor his winter quarters stood ready to receive him. But there were other beaches on the sea, and elsewhere they came without the harmful additives of the Lagoon and its febrile vapors. He remembered the name of a small seaside spa not far from Trieste that had been recommended to him. Why not go there? Yes, indeed, without delay, while the repeated change of locale still made sense. He told himself his mind was made up and rose to his feet. At the next stop, he hired a gondola to ferry him through the gloomy labyrinth of canals back toward the Piazza San Marco. It took him under ornate marble balconies flanked by sculpted lions, around corners of slimy stone walls and past mournful facades of pallazi topped by giant advertising signs that were reflected in the rippling bilge water. He had difficulty reaching his destination, for the gondolier was in league with various lace factories and glassworks and kept trying to drop him off to see and buy things. Thus, whenever the bizarre excursion through Venice began to cast a magic spell, the cutthroat commercialism of this sunken queen of cities did its irritating best to restore his senses to sobriety."
»Oft veränderten Schmuck und warme Bäder und Ruhe.«,»Often altered jewelry and warm baths and rest.«,"And suddenly exhilarated, he recited to himself the line: ""A frequent change of dress; warm baths, and rest.""","“Oft did they change their garments and bathe in warm water, reclining.”","changes of dress, warm baths and repose.”"

"Lebendige, geistig unverbindliche Greifbarkeit der Gestaltung bildet das Ergötzen der bürgerlichen Massen, aber leidenschaftlich unbedingte Jugend wird nur durch das Problematische gefesselt: und Aschenbach war problematisch, war unbedingt gewesen wie nur irgendein Jüngling. Er hatte dem Geiste gefrönt, mit der Erkenntnis Raubbau getrieben, Saatfrucht vermahlen, Geheimnisse preisgegeben, das Talent verdächtigt, die Kunst verraten,—ja, während seine Bildwerke die gläubig Genießenden unterhielten, erhoben, belebten, hatte er, der jugendliche Künstler, die Zwanzigjährigen durch seine Zynismen über das fragwürdige Wesen der Kunst, des Künstlertums selbst in Atem gehalten.","The bourgeois masses were delighted by the lively, intellectually non-committal tangibility of the design, but passionate, unconditional youth is only captivated by the problematic: and Aschenbach was problematic, had been unconditional like any other youth. He had indulged the spirit, overexploited knowledge, ground seed, divulged secrets, suspected talent, betrayed art—yes, while his sculptures entertained, uplifted, animated those who enjoyed believingly, he, the youthful artist, had the twenty-year-olds kept in suspense by his cynicism about the questionable nature of art, of artistry itself.","The general masses are satisfied by vigour and tangibility of treatment rather than by any close intellectual processes; but youth, with its passion for the absolute, can be arrested only by the problematical. And Aschenbach had been absolute, problematical, as only a youth could be. He had been a slave to the intellect, had played havoc with knowledge, had ground up his seed crops, had divulged secrets, had discredited talent, had betrayed art—yes, while his modellings were entertaining the faithful votaries, filling them with enthusiasm, making their lives more keen, this youthful artist was taking the breath away from the generation then in its twenties by his cynicisms on the questionable nature of art, and of artistry itself.","Lively, intellectually undemanding formulations are the delight of the bourgeois masses, while passionately unbending youth is excited only by the problematic, and Aschenbach was as problematic and unbending as any youth. He had overindulged the intellect, overcultivated erudition and ground up the seed corn, revealed secrets, defamed talent, betrayed art; yes, even as his works entertained, elevated, and animated the gullible reader, he, the youthful artist, held the twenty-year-olds in thrall to his cynical remarks about the questionable nature of art and artistic genius.","Easily comprehensible fiction that is filled with lively figures and does not unduly tax the reading mind may delight the middle-of-the-road masses, but youth, with its uncompromising passion, can only be captivated by what is problematic. Aschenbach had certainly been problematic, and as uncompromising as any boy. He had indulged the imagination, strip-mined the intellect, pulverized promising seeds, revealed secrets, incriminated talent and exposed art itself. Indeed, even as his verbal sculptures had entertained, exalted and inspired the devout enthusiasts, the young artist had also held the twenty-year-olds breathlessly enthralled with his cynical pronouncements about the dubious nature of art and the artist himself."
"Ob er nun aus dem Innern der Halle durch das bronzene Tor hervorgetreten oder von außen unversehens heran und hinauf gelangt war, blieb ungewiß. Aschenbach, ohne sich sonderlich in die Frage zu vertiefen, neigte zur ersteren Annahme. Mäßig hochgewachsen, mager, bartlos und auffallend stumpfnäsig, gehörte der Mann zum rothaarigen Typ und besaß dessen milchige und sommersprossige Haut. Offenbar war er durchaus nicht bajuwarischen Schlages: wie denn wenigstens der breit und gerade gerandete Basthut, der ihm den Kopf bedeckte, seinem Aussehen ein Gepräge des Fremdländischen und Weitherkommenden verlieh. Freilich trug er dazu den landesüblichen Rucksack um die Schultern geschnallt, einen gelblichen Gurtanzug aus Lodenstoff, wie es schien, einen grauen Wetterkragen über dem linken Unterarm, den er in die Weiche gestützt hielt, und in der Rechten einen mit eiserner Spitze versehenen Stock, welchen er schräg gegen den Boden stemmte und auf dessen Krücke er, bei gekreuzten Füßen, die Hüfte lehnte. Erhobenen Hauptes, so daß an seinem hager dem losen Sporthemd entwachsenden Halse der Adamsapfel stark und nackt hervortrat, blickte er mit farblosen, rot bewimperten Augen, zwischen denen, sonderbar genug zu seiner kurz aufgeworfenen Nase passend, zwei senkrechte, energische Furchen standen, scharf spähend ins Weite. So—und vielleicht trug sein erhöhter und erhöhender Standort zu diesem Eindruck bei—hatte seine Haltung etwas herrisch Überschauendes, Kühnes oder selbst Wildes; denn sei es, daß er, geblendet, gegen die untergehende Sonne grimassierte oder daß es sich um eine dauernde physiognomische Entstellung handelte: seine Lippen schienen zu kurz, sie waren völlig von den Zähnen zurückgezogen, dergestalt, daß diese, bis zum Zahnfleisch bloßgelegt, weiß und lang dazwischen hervorbleckten.","It remained uncertain whether he had emerged from the interior of the hall through the bronze gate or had inadvertently come up and up from the outside. Aschenbach, without delving too deeply into the question, was inclined to the former assumption. Moderately tall, thin, beardless and conspicuously snub-nosed, the man belonged to the red-haired type and possessed his milky and freckled skin. Apparently he was not of the Bavarian type at all: at least the broad, straight-brimmed raffia hat that covered his head gave his appearance a stamp of the foreign and far-flung. Of course he also wore the customary rucksack strapped around his shoulders, what appeared to be a yellowish harness made of loden fabric, a gray weather collar over his left forearm, which he held in the crotch, and in his right an iron-tipped cane, which he leaned diagonally against the ground and on whose crutch he leaned his hips, feet crossed. With his head raised so that the Adam's apple protruded strongly and bare on his gaunt neck growing out of his loose sports shirt, he looked with colorless, red lashed eyes, between which, oddly enough, matching his short, turned-up nose, stood two vertical, energetic furrows, peering keenly into the distance. So—and perhaps his elevated and exalting position contributed to this impression—there was something imperiously surveying, bold, or even wild about his bearing; for whether he was blinded, grimacing at the setting sun, or whether it was a question of a permanent physiognomic deformity: his lips seemed too short, they were completely pulled back from his teeth in such a way that, bared to the gums, they were white and peeked out long in between.","Whether he had just now come out from the inside through the bronze door, or had approached and mounted from the outside unobserved, remained uncertain. Aschenbach, without applying himself especially to the matter, was inclined to believe the former. Of medium height, thin, smooth-shaven, and noticeably pug-nosed, the man belonged to the red-haired type and possessed the appropriate fresh milky complexion. Obviously, he was not of Bavarian extraction, since at least the white and straight-brimmed straw hat that covered his head gave his appearance the stamp of a foreigner, of someone who had come from a long distance. To be sure, he was wearing the customary knapsack strapped across his shoulders, and a belted suit of rough yellow wool; his left arm was resting on his thigh, and his grey storm cape was thrown across it. In his right hand he held a cane with an iron ferrule, which he had stuck diagonally into the ground, and, with his feet crossed, was leaning his hip against the crook. His head was raised so that the Adam's-apple protruded hard and bare on a scrawny neck emerging from a loose sport-shirt. And he was staring sharply off into the distance, with colourless, red-lidded eyes between which stood two strong, vertical wrinkles peculiarly suited to his short, turned-up nose. Thus—and perhaps his elevated position helped to give the impression—his bearing had something majestic and commanding about it, something bold, or even savage. For whether he was grimacing because he was blinded by the setting sun, or whether it was a case of a permanent distortion of the physiognomy, his lips seemed too short, they were so completely pulled back from his teeth that these were exposed even to the gums, and stood out white and long.","Whether the man had emerged from the chapel’s inner sanctum through the bronze gate or mounted the steps unobtrusively from outside was uncertain. Without giving the matter much thought, Aschenbach inclined towards the first hypothesis. The man—of medium height, thin, beardless, and strikingly snub-nosed—was the red-haired type and had its milky, freckled pigmentation. He was clearly not of Bavarian stock and, if nothing else, the broad, straight-brimmed bast hat covering his head lent him a distinctly foreign, exotic air. He did, however, have the customary knapsack strapped to his shoulders, wore a yellowish belted suit of what appeared to be loden, and carried a gray waterproof over his left forearm, which he pressed to his side, and an iron-tipped walking stick in his right hand, and having thrust the stick diagonally into the ground, he had crossed his feet and braced one hip on its crook. Holding his head high and thus exposing a strong, bare Adam’s apple on the thin neck rising out of his loose, open shirt, he gazed alert into the distance with colorless, red-lashed eyes, the two pronounced vertical furrows between them oddly suited to the short, turned-up nose. Thus—and perhaps his elevated and elevating position contributed to the impression—there was something of the overseer, something lordly, bold, even wild in his demeanor, for be it that he was grimacing, blinded by the setting sun, or that he had a permanent facial deformity, his lips seemed too short: they pulled all the way back, baring his long, white teeth to the gums.","It was unclear whether he had just emerged from inside the chapel through the bronze door or whether suddenly, out of nowhere, he had climbed up there from the outside. Without being especially absorbed by the question, Aschenbach was inclined toward the former. Of moderate height, skinny, unwhiskered and possessing a remarkably snub nose, the man was one of those redheads with milky-white, freckled skin. To judge from external details, he was not of Old Bavarian stock: the wide, straight-brimmed raffia hat on his head, at least, made his appearance seem alien and faraway. Nonetheless, he was wearing the indigenous rucksack around his shoulders and a yellowish belted suit of what seemed to be loden, with a gray overcoat slung over his left forearm, which he held tightly pressed just below the ribs, and a metal-tipped cane in his right hand, against whose handle he leaned, feet crossed, with his hip. Head held high, so that his Adam’s apple emerged stark and bare from the wiry neck protruding from his loose tennis shirt , he peered with sharp, colorless eyes under red lashes out into the distance. Between them, there were two vigorous, perpendicular furrows that matched oddly with his short, upturned nose. Standing there like that—perhaps being elevated contributed to this impression—he had the imperious bearing of someone gazing down from on high, bold or even savage. Whether because he had to squint against the blinding effects of the setting sun or because his features were permanently distended, his lips seemed not to reach far enough down. Indeed they were so completely retracted from his teeth that the latter, bared to the gums, flashed out long and white."
—Aber nicht mit Ihnen.,—But not with you.,"""But not with you.""",“But not with you.”,“But not with you.”
"Dennoch war sich der Einsame eines besonderen Anrechtes bewußt, an dem Geheimnis teil zu haben, und, gleichwohl ausgeschlossen, fand er eine bizarre Genugtuung darin, die Wissenden mit verfänglichen Fragen anzugehen und sie, die zum Schweigen verbündet waren, zur ausdrücklichen Lüge zu nötigen. Eines Tages beim Frühstück im großen Speisesaal stellte er so den Geschäftsführer zur Rede, jenen kleinen, leise auftretenden Menschen im französischen Gehrock, der sich grüßend und beaufsichtigend zwischen den Speisenden bewegte und auch an Aschenbachs Tischchen zu einigen Plauderworten Halt machte. Warum man denn eigentlich, fragte der Gast in lässiger und beiläufiger Weise, warum in aller Welt, man seit einiger Zeit Venedig desinfiziere?—»Es handelt sich«, antwortete der Schleicher, »um eine Maßnahme der Polizei, bestimmt, allerlei Unzuträglichkeiten oder Störungen der öffentlichen Gesundheit, welche durch die brütende und ausnehmend warme Witterung erzeugt werden möchten, pflichtgemäß und beizeiten hintanzuhalten.«—»Die Polizei ist zu loben«, erwiderte Aschenbach, und nach Austausch einiger meteorologischer Bemerkungen empfahl sich der Manager.","Still, the lonely man felt a special right to share in the mystery, and, while excluded, found a bizarre satisfaction in questioning those who knew, and in forcing those who were allied in silence to outright lies. One day at breakfast in the large dining room, he confronted the manager, the small, soft-spoken person in a French frock coat, who moved among the diners, greeting and supervising, and also stopped at Aschenbach's table for a few chats. Why then, the guest asked in a nonchalant and casual way, why on earth have Venice been disinfected for some time now? ""It's a question,"" answered the Schleicher, ""a measure taken by the police, definitely all sorts of inconveniences or disturbances ""The police are to be commended,"" replied Aschenbach, and after exchanging a few meteorological remarks the manager took his leave.","Nevertheless the lone man felt especially entitled to participate in the secret; and although he was excluded, he derived a grotesque satisfaction from putting embarrassing questions to those who did know, and as they were pledged to silence, forcing them into deliberate lies. One day at breakfast in the large dining-hall he entered into a conversation with the manager, that softly-treading little man in the French frock coat who was moving amiably and solicitously about among the diners and had stopped at Aschenbach's table for a few passing words. Just why, the guest asked negligently and casually, had disinfectants become so prevalent in Venice recently? ""It has to do,"" was the evasive answer, ""with a police regulation, and is intended to prevent any inconveniences or disturbances to the public health which might result from the exceptionally warm and threatening weather."" . . . ""The police are to be congratulated,"" Aschenbach answered; and after the exchange of a few remarks on the weather, the manager left.","And yet the solitary traveler felt he had a special claim on the secret and, though excluded, took a bizarre pleasure in approaching insiders with insidious questions and forcing them, pledged as they were to silence, to tell outright lies. One day at breakfast in the main dining room he confronted the manager, the light-footed little man in the French frock coat who would circulate among the diners, greeting them and ensuring that things were as they should be, and had stopped at Aschenbach’s table for a few words. Why is it, the guest asked casually, as if by the by, why in the world have they been disinfecting Venice all this time? “It is a police precaution,” answered the hypocrite, “an official measure designed to forestall any situation injurious to the public health that might arise as a result of the sultry and unseasonably warm weather.” “The police are to be commended,” Aschenbach replied, and after a brief exchange of meteorological observations the manager excused himself.","Nevertheless, the solitary Aschenbach felt a special personal entitlement to share in the secret and, being kept in the dark, took a perverse pleasure in entrapping those in the know with loaded questions, forcing the conspirators into out-and-out lies. One day at breakfast in the main dining room, he conducted such an interrogation with the hotel manager, the small soft-spoken man in the French frock coat, who was moving around greeting the guests and supervising the service and had stopped at Aschenbach’s table to exchange a few idle words. Why, the guest asked in passing, why on earth had they recently begun spreading disinfectant in Venice? — “It’s just official precaution,” answered the slippery fellow. “It’s the authorities’ duty to take such measures in advance to prevent any disruptions or other breakdowns in public health that might result from the unusual heat and humidity.” — “The authorities are to be commended,” responded Aschenbach, and after the exchange of a few meteorological observations, the manager took his leave."
"Er war der teuren Erscheinung nicht gewärtig gewesen, sie kam unverhofft, er hatte nicht Zeit gehabt, seine Miene zu Ruhe und Würde zu befestigen. Freude, Überraschung, Bewunderung mochten sich offen darin malen, als sein Blick dem des Vermißten begegnete,—und in dieser Sekunde geschah es, daß Tadzio lächelte: ihn anlächelte, sprechend, vertraut, liebreizend und unverhohlen, mit Lippen, die sich im Lächeln erst langsam öffneten. Es war das Lächeln des Narziß, der sich über das spiegelnde Wasser neigt, jenes tiefe, bezauberte, hingezogene Lächeln, mit dem er nach dem Widerschein der eigenen Schönheit die Arme streckt,—ein ganz wenig verzerrtes Lächeln, verzerrt von der Aussichtslosigkeit seines Trachtens, die holden Lippen seines Schattens zu küssen, kokett, neugierig und leise gequält, betört und betörend.","He hadn't expected the expensive apparition, it had come unexpectedly, he hadn't had time to settle his face into calm and dignity. Joy, surprise, admiration could be openly painted in it when his gaze met that of the missing person—and in that second it happened that Tadzio smiled: smiled at him, speaking, familiarly, charmingly and openly, with lips that only curled in the smile slowly opened. It was the smile of Narcissus, who bends over the reflecting water, that deep, enchanted, drawn-in smile with which he stretches out his arms after the reflection of his own beauty—a very slightly distorted smile, distorted by the hopelessness of his aspirations, to kiss the lovely lips of his shadow, coquettishly, curiously and gently tormented, infatuated and beguiling.","He had not been prepared for this rich spectacle; it came unhoped for. He had no time to entrench himself behind an expression of repose and dignity. Pleasure, surprise, admiration must have shown on his face as his eyes met those of the boy—and at this moment it happened that Tadzio smiled, smiled to him, eloquently, familiarly, charmingly, without concealment; and during the smile his lips slowly opened. It was the smile of Narcissus bent over the reflecting water, that deep, fascinated, magnetic smile with which he stretches out his arms to the image of his own beauty—a smile distorted ever so little, distorted at the hopelessness of his efforts to kiss the pure lips of the shadow. It was coquettish, inquisitive, and slightly tortured. It was infatuated, and infatuating.","He was unprepared for the precious apparition: it had come unexpectedly, and he had not had time to put on a calm, dignified expression. Joy, surprise, and admiration may thus have shown openly in his face when his eyes met those of the boy who had disappeared, and at that instant it happened: Tadzio smiled, smiled at him, with an effusive, intimate, charming, unabashed smile, his lips opening slowly. It was the smile of Narcissus bending over the water mirror, the deep, enchanted, protracted smile with which he stretched out his arms to the reflection of his own beauty, an ever so slightly contorted smile—contorted by the hopelessness of his endeavor to kiss the lovely lips of his shadow—and coquettish, inquisitive and mildly pained, beguiled and beguiling.","He was unprepared for this priceless apparition. It came unannounced, leaving him no time to assume an expression of composed dignity. Joy, surprise and wonder must have been splashed across his face as his eye met that of the missing boy, for at precisely that second it happened that Tadzio smiled, smiled at him with an insinuating, familiar, charming and unabashed smile, his lips parting only slowly at the end. It was the smile of Narcissus bending down over his reflection in the water, that deep, mesmerized, prolonged smile with which he reaches out toward the reflection of his own beauty—an ever so slightly off-kilter smile, distorted by the futility of wanting to kiss the fair lips of his own shadow, coquettish, curious and a bit troubled, enthralled and enthralling."
"Er sah ihn kommen, von links, am Rande des Meeres daher, sah ihn von rückwärts zwischen den Hütten hervortreten oder fand auch wohl plötzlich und nicht ohne ein frohes Erschrecken, daß er sein Kommen versäumt und daß er schon da war, schon in dem blau und weißen Badeanzug, der jetzt am Strand seine einzige Kleidung war, sein gewohntes Treiben in Sonne und Sand wieder aufgenommen hatte,—dies lieblich nichtige, müßig unstete Leben, das Spiel war und Ruhe, ein Schlendern, Waten, Graben, Haschen, Lagern und Schwimmen, bewacht, berufen von den Frauen auf der Plattform, die mit Kopfstimmen seinen Namen ertönen ließen: »Tadziu! Tadziu!« und zu denen er mit eifrigem Gebärdenspiel gelaufen kam, ihnen zu erzählen, was er erlebt, ihnen zu zeigen, was er gefunden, gefangen: Muscheln, Seepferdchen, Quallen und seitlich laufende Krebse. Aschenbach verstand nicht ein Wort von dem, was er sagte, und mochte es das Alltäglichste sein, es war verschwommener Wohllaut in seinem Ohr. So erhob Fremdheit des Knaben Rede zur Musik, eine übermütige Sonne goß verschwenderischen Glanz über ihn aus, und die erhabene Tiefsicht des Meeres war immer seiner Erscheinung Folie und Hintergrund.","He saw him coming from the left, along the edge of the sea, saw him stepping out from behind between the huts, or he suddenly and not without a happy shock found that he had missed his coming and that he was already there, already in the blue and white bathing suit, which was now his only clothing on the beach, had resumed his usual hustle and bustle in the sun and sand—this lovely vain, idle, unsteady life that was play and rest, a stroll, wading, digging, catching, lounging and Swim, guarded, summoned by the women on the platform, who chanted his name with head voices: 'Tadziu! Tadziu!' and to whom he ran with eager gestures to tell them what he was experiencing, to show them what he had caught: mussels, seahorses, jellyfish and crabs running sideways. Aschenbach didn't understand a word of what he said, and even if it was the most commonplace, there was a blurry euphony in his ear. Thus the boy's strangeness raised speech to music, a high-spirited sun poured out lavish splendor over him, and the sublime deep view of the sea was always the foil and background of his appearance.","He saw him approaching from the left, along the edge of the sea; he saw him as he stepped out backwards from among the cabins; or he would suddenly find, with a shock of pleasure, that he had missed his coming, that he was already here in the blue and white bathing suit which was his only garment now while on the beach, that he had already commenced his usual activities in the sun and the sand—a pleasantly trifling, idle, and unstable manner of living, a mixture of rest and play. Tadzio would saunter about, wade, dig, catch things, lie down, go for a swim, all the while being kept under surveillance by the women on the platform who made his name ring out in their falsetto voices: ""Tadziu! Tadziu!"" Then he would come running to them with a look of eagerness, to tell them what he had seen, what he had experienced, or to show them what he had found or caught: mussels, sea-horses, jelly-fish, and crabs that ran sideways. Aschenbach did not understand a word he said, and though it might have been the most ordinary thing in the world, it was a vague harmony in his ear. So the foreignness of the boy's speech turned it into music, a wanton sun poured its prodigal splendour down over him, and his figure was always set off against the background of an intense sea-blue.","He would see him coming, from the left, along the shore, see him emerge from between cabanas, or he might suddenly realize—not without a pleasant shock—that he had missed his arrival, that he was already there, already in the blue-and-white bathing costume that was now his sole beach attire, and that he had resumed his customary sun-and-sand activities—the charmingly frivolous, idly bustling existence that with its ambling, wading, digging, grabbing, lolling, and swimming was both play and rest—overseen by the women on the platform calling “Tadziu! Tadziu!” to him in their high-pitched voices, and he would run up to them, gesturing animatedly, and tell them what he had been doing, show them what he had found or caught: mussels, sea horses, jellyfish, crabs that go sideways. Aschenbach understood not a word of what he said, yet humdrum as it might be it was mellifluent harmony to his ear. Thus the foreignness of the boy’s speech transformed it into music, the exuberant sun poured its copious rays over him, and the sea and its sublime depths provided a constant foil and backdrop for his presence.","He would see him approaching from the left along the edge of the sea. He would suddenly spy his back emerging from between the huts or sometimes he would discover, not without joyous alarm, that he had missed the boy’s arrival, that he was already there and had already resumed, in the blue-and-white-striped swimsuit that had become his exclusive beach attire, his usual sun-and-sand activities—that delightfully trivial, idly restless life of play and relaxation, one long span of strolling, wading, digging, chasing, lying and swimming, watched over and summoned by the women on the deck, who kept shouting his name “Tadziu! Tadziu!” in falsetto and to whom he came running, gesturing with excitement, to tell of his adventures and show his various finds and catches: mussels, tiny sea horses, jellyfish, sideways scuttling crabs. Aschenbach didn’t understand a single word of what he said, but however commonplace it might have been, the sounds were a lovely warm blur in his ear. The impenetrability of the foreign tongue turned the boy’s speech to music, an irrepressible sun bathed him in luxuriant glow and the sublimely deep view of the sea provided a constant backdrop and background against which he appeared."
"»Es wäre nun nur noch«, sagte er, »die Gesichtshaut ein wenig aufzufrischen.«","""Now all that remains,"" he said, ""is to freshen up the skin of your face a little.""","""All that is left now,"" he said, ""would be to freshen up the skin a little.""","“All that is left to be done,” he said, “is to freshen up the face a bit.”","“The only thing left,” he said, “would be to put a little color in your complexion.”"
"Angst war der Anfang, Angst und Lust und eine entsetzte Neugier nach dem, was kommen wollte. Nacht herrschte, und seine Sinne lauschten; denn weither näherte sich Getümmel, Getöse, ein Gemisch von Lärm: Rasseln, Schmettern und dumpfes Donnern, schrilles Jauchzen dazu und ein bestimmtes Geheul im gezogenen u-Laut, alles durchsetzt und grauenhaft süß übertönt von tief girrendem, ruchlos beharrlichen Flötenspiel, welches auf schamlos zudringende Art die Eingeweide bezauberte. Aber er wußte ein Wort, dunkel, doch das benennend was kam: »Der fremde Gott!« Qualmige Glut glomm auf: da erkannte er Bergland, ähnlich dem um sein Sommerhaus. Und in zerrissenem Licht, von bewaldeter Höhe, zwischen Stämmen und moosigen Felstrümmern wälzte es sich und stürzte wirbelnd herab: Menschen, Tiere, ein Schwarm, eine tobende Rotte, und überschwemmte die Halde mit Leibern, Flammen, Tumult und taumelndem Rundtanz. Weiber, strauchelnd über zu lange Fellgewänder, die ihnen vom Gürtel hingen, schüttelten Schellentrommeln über ihren stöhnend zurückgeworfenen Häuptern, schwangen stiebende Fackelbrände und nackte Dolche, hielten züngelnde Schlangen in der Mitte des Leibes erfaßt oder trugen schreiend ihre Brüste in beiden Händen. Männer, Hörner über den Stirnen, mit Pelzwerk geschürzt und zottig von Haut, beugten die Nacken und hoben Arme und Schenkel, ließen eherne Becken erdröhnen und schlugen wütend auf Pauken, während glatte Knaben mit umlaubten Stäben Böcke stachelten, an deren Hörner sie sich klammerten und von deren Sprüngen sie sich jauchzend schleifen ließen. Und die Begeisterten heulten den Ruf aus weichen Mitlauten und gezogenem u-Ruf am Ende, süß und wild zugleich, wie kein jemals erhörter: hier klang er auf, in die Lüfte geröhrt, wie von Hirschen, und dort gab man ihn wieder, vielstimmig, in wüstem Triumph, hetzte einander damit zum Tanz und Schleudern der Glieder und ließ ihn niemals verstummen. Aber alles durchdrang und beherrschte der tiefe, lockende Flötenton. Lockte er nicht auch ihn, den widerstrebend Erlebenden, schamlos beharrlich zum Fest und Unmaß des äußersten Opfers? Groß war sein Abscheu, groß seine Furcht, redlich sein Wille, bis zuletzt das Seine zu schützen gegen den Fremden, den Feind des gefaßten und würdigen Geistes. Aber der Lärm, das Geheul, vervielfacht von hallender Bergwand, wuchs, nahm Überhand, schwoll zu hinreißendem Wahnsinn. Dünste bedrängten den Sinn, der beizende Ruch der Böcke, Witterung keuchender Leiber und ein Hauch wie von faulenden Wassern, dazu ein anderer noch, vertraut: nach Wunden und umlaufender Krankheit. Mit den Paukenschlägen dröhnte sein Herz, sein Gehirn kreiste, Wut ergriff ihn, Verblendung, betäubende Wollust, und seine Seele begehrte, sich anzuschließen dem Reigen des Gottes. Das obszöne Symbol, riesig, aus Holz, ward enthüllt und erhöht: da heulten sie zügelloser die Losung. Schaum vor den Lippen tobten sie, reizten einander mit geilen Gebärden und buhlenden Händen, lachend und ächzend,—stießen die Stachelstäbe einander ins Fleisch und leckten das Blut von den Gliedern. Aber mit ihnen, in ihnen war der Träumende nun und dem fremden Gotte gehörig. Ja, sie waren er selbst, als sie reißend und mordend sich auf die Tiere hinwarfen und dampfende Fetzen verschlangen, als auf zerwühltem Moosgrund grenzenlose Vermischung begann, dem Gotte zum Opfer. Und seine Seele kostete Unzucht und Raserei des Unterganges.","Fear was the beginning, fear and lust and a terrified curiosity about what was to come. Night reigned and his senses listened; for far away there was a tumult, a tumult, a mixture of noise: rattling, crashing and dull thunder, shrill whoops and a certain howling in the drawn u-sound, everything interspersed and horribly sweet drowned out by deeply cooing, ruthlessly persistent flute playing, which on shameless intrusive manner charmed the bowels. But he knew a word, obscure, but naming what was coming: ""The foreign god!"" A smoky glow smoldered: then he recognized mountains, similar to that around his summer house. And in torn light, from wooded heights, among trunks and mossy rocky debris, it rolled and tumbled down whirling: men, beasts, a swarm, a raging pack, and flooded the heap with bodies, flames, tumult and tumbling round dance. Women, stumbling over too-long fur garments that hung from their belts, shook tambourines over their moaning, thrown back heads, brandished spurting torches and naked daggers, held tongues of serpents in the middle of their bodies, or carried their breasts in both hands, screaming. Men, horns on their foreheads, draped in furs and shaggy with skin, bowed their necks and lifted arms and thighs, banged brazen cymbals and banged furiously on drums, while sleek boys with leafy staffs goaded goats, clinging to their horns and by whose leaps they let themselves be dragged, rejoicing. And the enthusiastic ones howled the call from soft consonant sounds and a drawn u-call at the end, sweet and wild at the same time, like no one had ever heard: here it sounded, roared into the air, as if by deer, and there it was played again, in many voices, in wild triumph, rousing each other to dance and hurling their limbs with it, and never let it stop. But the deep, alluring sound of the flute penetrated and dominated everything. Did he not also lure him, the reluctant experiencer, shamelessly persistently to the feast and immoderation of the utmost sacrifice? Great was his disgust, great his fear, honest his will to protect his own to the end against the stranger, the enemy of the composed and worthy spirit. But the noise, the howl, multiplied by the echoing mountain wall, grew, took over, swelled to ravishing madness. Vapors oppressed the senses, the stinging smell of the goats, the scent of panting bodies and a whiff of rotting water, plus another familiar one: after wounds and circulating illness. His heart pounded with drumbeats, his brain spun, anger seized him, blindness, numbing lust, and his soul longed to join the god's dance. The obscene symbol, huge, made of wood, was unveiled and exalted: then they howled the slogan more unrestrained. They raged, foaming at the lips, teasing each other with lewd gestures and courting hands, laughing and groaning—the spiked rods poked each other in the flesh and licked the blood from their limbs. But with them, in them, the dreaming was now and belonged to the foreign god. Yes, they were himself when, tearing and murdering, they threw themselves down on the animals and devoured steaming rags, when boundless mixing began on the torn-up moss ground, sacrificed to the god. And his soul tasted fornication and frenzy of destruction.","It began with anguish, anguish and desire, and a frightened curiosity as to what was coming. It was night, and his senses were on the watch. From far off a grumble, an uproar, was approaching, a jumble of noises. Clanking, blaring, and dull thunder, with shrill shouts and a definite whine in a long drawn out u-sound—all this was sweetly, ominously interspersed and dominated by the deep cooing of wickedly persistent flutes which charmed the bowels in a shamelessly penetrative manner. But he knew one word; it was veiled, and yet would name what was approaching: "" The foreign god!"" Vaporous fire began to glow; then he recognized mountains like those about his summer house. And in the scattered light, from high up in the woods, among tree trunks and crumbling moss-grown rocks—people, beasts, a throng, a raging mob plunged twisting and whirling downwards, and made the hill swarm with bodies, flames, tumult, and a riotous round dance. Women, tripped by over-long fur draperies which hung from their waists, were holding up tambourines and beating on them, their groaning heads flung back. Others swung sparking firebrands and bare daggers, or wore hissing snakes about the middle of their bodies, or shrieking held their breasts in their two hands. Men with horns on their foreheads, shaggy-haired, girded with hides, bent back their necks and raised their arms and thighs, clashed brass cymbals and beat furiously at kettledrums, while smooth boys prodded he-goats with wreathed sticks, climbing on their horns and falling off with shouts when they bounded. And the bacchantes wailed the word with the soft consonants and the drawn out u-sound, at once sweet and savage, like nothing ever heard before. In one place it rang out as though piped into the air by stags, and it was echoed in another by many voices, in wild triumph—with it they incited one another to dance and to fling out their arms and legs, and it was never silent. But everything was pierced and dominated by the deep coaxing flute. He who was fighting against this experience—did it not coax him too with its shameless penetration, into the feast and the excesses of the extreme sacrifice? His repugnance, his fear, were keen—he was honourably set on defending himself to the very last against the barbarian, the foe to intellectual poise and dignity. But the noise, the howling, multiplied by the resonant walls of the hills, grew, took the upper hand, swelled to a fury of rapture. Odours oppressed the senses, the pungent smell of the bucks, the scent of moist bodies, and a waft of stagnant water, with another smell, something familiar, the smell of wounds and prevalent disease. At the beating of the drum his heart fluttered, his head was spinning, he was caught in a frenzy, in a blinding deafening lewdness—and he yearned to join the ranks of the god. The obscene symbol, huge, wooden, was uncovered and raised up; then they howled the magic word with more abandon. Foaming at the mouth, they raged, teased one another with ruttish gestures and caressing hands; laughing and groaning, they stuck the goads into one another's flesh and licked the blood from their limbs. But the dreamer now was with them, in them, and he belonged to the foreign god. Yes, they were he himself, as they hurled themselves biting and tearing upon the animals, got entangled in steaming rags, and fell in promiscuous unions on the torn moss, in sacrifice to their god. And his soul tasted the unchastity and fury of decay.","It began with fear, fear and desire and a dire curiosity about what was to come. Night reigned, yet his senses were vigilant, for from afar there approached a din, a racket, a jumble of noise: a rattling, a blaring and muffled thundering, a shrill cheering as well, and a kind of howl in the form of a long-drawn-out u—all of it permeated with, overlain by the eerily sweet tones of a deep-cooing, insidiously persistent flute casting its shamelessly tenacious spell on his innermost being. But he knew a word, obscure yet naming what was to come: “the strangergod.” In the glow of some smoky embers he discerned a mountainous region similar to the one in which his summerhouse was located, and down from the wooded heights, in the spotty light, past tree trunks and mossy boulders, down tumbled whirling men and beasts, a swarm, a raging horde, inundating the slope with bodies, flames, bedlam, a reeling round-dance: women, stumbling over long hide garments hanging free from the waist, shaking tambourines over heads flung back and moaning, brandishing blazing, sparking torches and naked daggers, holding up snakes with flickering tongues by the middle of their bodies, or cupping their breasts in both hands and shrieking; men with horns coming out of their foreheads, fur loincloths, and shaggy torsos, with necks bent and arms and thighs raised, with a pounding of brazen cymbals and the frenzied beating of drums; smooth-skinned youths prodding he-goats with leafy staffs, clutching their horns, letting themselves be dragged along and whooping at each leap. And the elated revelers howled out their call of soft consonants ending in a long-drawn-out u—sweet and wild at once, like none heard ever before, here resounding in the air like the belling of a stag, there resumed by a multitude of voices in boisterous triumph—and goading one another on to dance and fling their limbs about they never let it fade. Yet infusing it all, dominating it all, were the deep alluring tones of the flute. Did they not lure him too, much as he resisted the experience , did they not lure him with shameless resolve to the festivities and the enormity of the ultimate sacrifice? Great was his repugnance, great his fear, honorable his intention to defend his domain against the stranger, the enemy of the serene and dignified intellect. But the noise, the howling, intensified many times over by the reverberating mountainside, grew out of control and swelled into raging madness. His mind was muddled by fumes: the goats’ pungent stench, the reek of panting bodies, a smell like that of stagnant waters, and another smell, likewise familiar—the smell of sores and rampant disease. His heart throbbed to the drumbeats, his brain reeled, he was seized by wrath, by blindness, by numbing lust, and his soul longed to join in the round-dance of the god. The obscene symbol, gigantic and made of wood, was bared and raised with a roar of their watchword more ferocious than ever. On they raged, mouths foaming, enflaming one another with lascivious gestures and licentious hands, laughing and groaning, thrusting the goads into one another’s flesh and licking the blood from their limbs. But the dreamer was now with them, within them: he belonged to the strangergod. Yes, they were now his own self as they hurled themselves upon the animals, lacerating them, slaughtering them, devouring gobbets of steaming flesh, as they dropped to the trampled mossy ground for unbridled coupling, an offering to the god. And his soul savored the debauchery and delirium of doom.","Fear was the beginning, fear and desire and a horrified curiosity about what was about to transpire. Night had descended, and his senses were alert, for, from far away, came turbulence, turmoil, a terrible violent racket—rustling, smashing and dull rumbling, shrill cheering, too, and a certain howl like a drawn-out u—all permeated and at times drowned out by the deep warbling of a gruesomely sweet, ruthlessly insistent flute, which mesmerized his very innards with its shamelessly cloying tone. Still he knew a phrase, albeit obscure, to describe what was approaching: the Other God! Smoky flames began to glow: he could make out mountainous land, similar to that around his country house. And in this refracted light, through the branches and the mossy boulders, something began to thrash and spin its way down from the wooded peak—humans, animals, a swarm, a raging herd. The slope was inundated with bodies, flames, tumult and frenzied circles of dance. Wailing women stumbled over clumsily long animal hides secured by belts and shook tambourines over each other’s upturned, moaning heads, swung spark-laden torches and unsheathed daggers, carried fork-tongued snakes coiled around their waists and clutched at their breasts with both hands. Men—with horns above their brows, animal-hide loincloths and hairy skin—bowed their heads, exposed their necks, lifted their arms and thighs in the air, banged iron cymbals and furiously pounded drums, while smooth-skinned boys prodded goats with leaf-wound staffs, clinging to the animals’ antlers and crying out with joy as they were dragged around in leaps. What’s more, the revellers were all howling out that word with the soft consonants and the drawn-out u at the end, simultaneously sweet and wild, like nothing ever heard. It sounded first here, bellowed into the air as though by rutting stags, then there, a chorus of voices adopting it as a rowdy chant of triumph, inciting each other to dance and flail their limbs, never letting it fade. Meanwhile the low seductive sounds of the flute ran through and above it all. Was it not also trying to seduce him, the reluctant spectator, enticing him with shameless tenacity to join in the wanton festivity of utmost sacrifice? His revulsion was great, great, too, his fear, and he was sincerely determined to defend what was his to the last against the Other God, the enemy of his composed and dignified intellect. But the noise and the howling kept increasing, amplified by the echoing mountainside, drowning out everything else, swelling into irresistible insanity. Odors assaulted his nose: the bitter stench of the goats, excrescent bodily scents, a whiff of something like stagnant waters, and, along with them, yet another familiar smell—that of wounds and rampant disease. His heart pounded to the drumbeats, his mind whirled, rage seized him, blindness, numbing lust, and his soul craved to join the dancing circle of the god. The obscene symbol, a giant piece of wood, was unveiled and raised, at which the revelers all began to howl their battle cry with greater abandon. Frothing at the mouth, they raged, clawing with lurid expressions and ravenous hands, laughing and moaning, stabbing each other with prods and licking the blood from each other’s limbs. But now, with them, among them, was the dreaming Aschenbach. He had given himself over to the Other God. Yes, he was one of them as they attacked and slaughtered the animals, tearing them to dripping shreds and devouring the remains, and again, as free and open copulation in honor of the god began everywhere on the mossy ground. And his soul tasted descent’s orgiastic fury."
"Nach einigen Jahren der Unruhe, einigen Versuchsaufenthalten da und dort wählte er frühzeitig München zum dauernden Wohnsitz und lebte dort in bürgerlichem Ehrenstande, wie er dem Geiste in besonderen Einzelfällen zuteil wird. Die Ehe, die er in noch jugendlichem Alter mit einem Mädchen aus gelehrter Familie eingegangen, wurde nach kurzer Glücksfrist durch den Tod getrennt. Eine Tochter, schon Gattin, war ihm geblieben. Einen Sohn hatte er nie besessen.","After a few years of restlessness, a few experimental stays here and there, he chose Munich as his permanent residence early on and lived there in the civil status of honor that is bestowed upon the spirit in special individual cases. The marriage he entered into at a young age with a girl from a learned family was separated by death after a short period of happiness. One daughter, already a wife, remained with him. He had never had a son.","After a few years of unrest, a few tentative stopping-places here and there, he soon chose Munich as his permanent home, and lived there in a state of middle-class respectability such as fits in with the life of the mind in certain individual instances. The marriage which, when still young, he had contracted with a girl of an educated family came to an end with her death after a short period of happiness. He was left with a daughter, now married. He had never had a son.","After several restless years of testing this place and that, he eventually chose Munich as his permanent residence and led a solid bourgeois existence there, enjoying the respect that is in certain cases vouchsafed the intellect. The marriage he had contracted in his youth with a girl from a scholarly family was cut short, following a brief period of bliss, by the girl’s death. It left him with a daughter, who was now married. He had had no son.","Early on, after a few unsettled years trying out various locations, he selected Munich as his permanent residence and lived there enjoying a position of the highest bourgeois respect, the sort of respect that is occasionally granted to men of intellect in certain exceptional cases. The marriage he concluded while still a young man, to a girl from an academic family, ended after a few short years of happiness with her death. He was left with a daughter, already married. He had no son."
"Wohl möglich, daß Aschenbach es bei seiner halb zerstreuten, halb inquisitiven Musterung des Fremden an Rücksicht hatte fehlen lassen; denn plötzlich ward er gewahr, daß jener seinen Blick erwiderte und zwar so kriegerisch, so gerade ins Auge hinein, so offenkundig gesonnen, die Sache aufs Äußerste zu treiben und den Blick des andern zum Abzug zu zwingen, daß Aschenbach, peinlich berührt, sich abwandte und einen Gang die Zäune entlang begann, mit dem beiläufigen Entschluß, des Menschen nicht weiter achtzuhaben. Er hatte ihn in der nächsten Minute vergessen. Mochte nun aber das Wandererhafte in der Erscheinung des Fremden auf seine Einbildungskraft gewirkt haben oder sonst irgendein physischer oder seelischer Einfluß im Spiele sein: eine seltsame Ausweitung seines Innern ward ihm ganz überraschend bewußt, eine Art schweifender Unruhe, ein jugendlich durstiges Verlangen in die Ferne, ein Gefühl, so lebhaft, so neu oder doch so längst entwöhnt und verlernt, daß er, die Hände auf dem Rücken und den Blick am Boden, gefesselt stehen blieb, um die Empfindung auf Wesen und Ziel zu prüfen. Es war Reiselust, nichts weiter; aber wahrhaft als Anfall auftretend und ins Leidenschaftliche, ja bis zur Sinnestäuschung gesteigert. Er sah nämlich, als Beispiel gleichsam für alle Wunder und Schrecken der mannigfaltigen Erde, die seine Begierde sich auf einmal vorzustellen trachtete,—sah wie mit leiblichem Auge eine ungeheuere Landschaft, ein tropisches Sumpfgebiet unter dickdunstigem Himmel, feucht, üppig und ungesund, eine von Menschen gemiedene Urweltwildnis aus Inseln, Morästen und Schlamm führenden Wasserarmen. Die flachen Eilande, deren Boden mit Blättern, so dick wie Hände, mit riesigen Farnen, mit fettem, gequollenem und abenteuerlich blühendem Pflanzenwerk überwuchert war, sandten haarige Palmenschäfte empor, und wunderlich ungestalte Bäume, deren Wurzeln dem Stamm entwuchsen und sich durch die Luft in den Boden, ins Wasser senkten, bildeten verworrene Waldungen. Auf der stockenden, grünschattig spiegelnden Flut schwammen, wie Schüsseln groß, milchweiße Blumen; Vögel von fremder Art, hochschultrig, mit unförmigen Schnäbeln, standen auf hohen Beinen im Seichten und blickten unbeweglich zur Seite, während durch ausgedehnte Schilffelder ein klapperndes Wetzen und Rauschen ging, wie durch Heere von Geharnischten; dem Schauenden war es, als hauchte der laue, mephitische Odem dieser geilen und untauglichen Öde ihn an, die in einem ungeheuerlichen Zustande von Werden oder Vergehen zu schweben schien, zwischen den knotigen Rohrstämmen eines Bambusdickichts glaubte er einen Augenblick die phosphoreszierenden Lichter des Tigers funkeln zu sehen—und fühlte sein Herz pochen vor Entsetzen und rätselhaftem Verlangen. Dann wich das Gesicht; und mit einem Kopfschütteln nahm Aschenbach seine Promenade an den Zäunen der Grabsteinmetzereien wieder auf.","It is quite possible that Aschenbach had failed to show consideration in his half-absent, half-inquisitive examination of the stranger; for suddenly he became aware that the other returned his gaze and so warily, so straight in the eye, so obviously intent on taking the matter to the extreme and forcing the other's gaze to deviate, that Aschenbach, embarrassed, turned away and began a walk along the fences, casually deciding not to pay any further attention to the human being. He'd forgotten about it in the next minute. But whether the vagrant aspect of the stranger's appearance might have had an effect on his imagination, or some other physical or mental influence might be at play: he became quite surprisingly aware of a strange expansion of his inner being, a kind of wandering unrest, a youthful, thirsty longing for far-off places, a feeling so vivid, so new, or at least so long unfamiliar and unlearned, that he remained standing with his hands behind his back and his eyes on the floor, in order to examine the nature and purpose of the sensation. It was wanderlust, nothing more; but really occurring as an attack and intensified to the point of passion, even to the point of delusion. For he saw, as an example, as it were, of all the wonders and horrors of the diverse earth which his desire sought at once to imagine—saw, as with the physical eye, an immense landscape, a tropical swamp under a thick, hazy sky, damp, luxuriant, and unhealthy, one of People avoided primeval wilderness of islands, swamps and mud-filled arms of water. The flat isles, whose bottom was overgrown with leaves as thick as hands, with gigantic ferns, with fat, swollen, and strangely blooming plants, sent up hairy shafts of palms, and strangely shapeless trees, whose roots grew out of the trunk and spread through the air in the ground, lowered into the water, formed tangled forests. Milky-white flowers, as big as bowls, swam on the stagnant, green-shaded, reflecting tide; Birds of a strange kind, high-shouldered, with misshapen beaks, stood on high legs in the shallows and looked motionless to the side, while a clattering whizzing and rustling went through vast fields of reeds, as through armies of armored men; it was as if the lukewarm, mephitic breath of this horny and useless wasteland, which seemed to hover in a monstrous state of becoming or passing away, seemed to breathe on him. Between the gnarled trunks of a bamboo thicket he thought for a moment the phosphorescent lights of the tiger were twinkling on him see—and felt his heart pound with terror and mysterious longing. Then the face left; and with a shake of his head, Aschenbach resumed his promenade along the fences of the tombstone masons.","It is quite possible that Aschenbach, in his half-distracted, half-inquisitive examination of the stranger, had been somewhat inconsiderate, for he suddenly became aware that his look was being answered, and indeed so militantly, so straight in the eye, so plainly with the intention of driving the thing through to the very end and compelling him to capitulate, that he turned away uncomfortably and began walking along by the fences, deciding casually that he would pay no further attention to the man. The next minute he had forgotten him. But perhaps the exotic element in the stranger's appearance had worked on his imagination; or a new physical or spiritual influence of some sort had come into play. He was quite astonished to note a peculiar inner expansion, a kind of roving unrest, a youthful longing after far-off places: a feeling so vivid, so new, or so long dormant and neglected, that, with his hands behind his back and his eyes on the ground, he came to a sudden stop, and examined into the nature and purport of this emotion. It was the desire for travel, nothing more; although, to be sure, it had attacked him violently, and was heightened to a passion, even to the point of an hallucination. His yearnings crystallized; his imagination, still in ferment from his hours of work, actually pictured all the marvels and terrors of a manifold world which it was suddenly struggling to conceive. He saw a landscape, a tropical swampland under a heavy, murky sky, damp, luxuriant, and enormous, a kind of prehistoric wilderness of islands, bogs, and arms of water, sluggish with mud; he saw, near him and in the distance, the hairy shafts of palms rising out of a rank lecherous thicket, out of places where the plant-life was fat, swollen, and blossoming exorbitantly; he saw strangely misshapen trees sending their roots into the ground, into stagnant pools with greenish reflections; and here, between floating flowers which were milk-white and large as dishes, birds of a strange nature, high-shouldered, with crooked bills, were standing in the muck, and looking motionlessly to one side; between dense, knotted stalks of bamboo he saw the glint from the eyes of a crouching tiger—and he felt his heart knocking with fear and with puzzling desires. Then the image disappeared; and with a shake of his head Aschenbach resumed his walk along past the fences of the stone-masons' establishments.","Aschenbach’s half-distracted, half-inquisitive scrutiny of the stranger may have been lacking in discretion, for he suddenly perceived that the man was returning his stare and was indeed so belligerently, so directly, so blatantly determined to challenge him publicly and force him to withdraw it that Aschenbach, embarrassed, turned away and set off along the fence, vaguely resolved to take no further notice of him. A minute later he had forgotten the man. It may have been the stranger’s perambulatory appearance that acted upon his imagination or some other physical or psychological influence coming into play, but much to his surprise he grew aware of a strange expansion of his inner being, a kind of restive anxiety, a fervent youthful craving for faraway places, a feeling so vivid, so new or else so long outgrown and forgotten that he came to a standstill and—hands behind his back, eyes on the ground, rooted to the spot—examined the nature and purport of the feeling. It was wanderlust, pure and simple, yet it had come upon him like a seizure and grown into a passion— no, more, an hallucination. His desire sprouted eyes, his imagination, as yet unstilled from its morning labors, conjured forth the earth’s manifold wonders and horrors in his attempt to visualize them: he saw. He saw a landscape, a tropical quagmire beneath a steamy sky—sultry, luxuriant, and monstrous—a kind of primordial wilderness of islands, marshes, and alluvial channels; saw hairy palm shafts thrusting upward, near and far, from rank clusters of bracken, from beds of thick, swollen, and bizarrely burgeoning flora; saw fantastically malformed trees plunge their roots through the air into the soil, into stagnant, shadow-green, looking-glass waters, where, amidst milk-white flowers bobbing like bowls, outlandish stoop-shouldered birds with misshapen beaks stood stock-still in the shallows, peering off to one side; saw the eyes of a crouching tiger gleam out of the knotty canes of a bamboo thicket—and felt his heart pound with terror and an enigmatic craving. Then the vision faded, and with a shake of the head Aschenbach resumed his promenade along the gravestone cutters’ fences.","It could have been that, in taking stock of this alien figure in his half-distracted, half-inquisitive way, Aschenbach had overstepped the bounds of polite restraint. He suddenly became aware of the man staring back at him, so militantly, so directly and so obviously intent upon escalating the matter and forcing the opponent to avert his eyes, that he turned away, smarting, and began to walk along the fences, resolving as he did to take no further notice of the fellow. A minute later he had forgotten him. Nonetheless, be it that the traveler-like aspects of the alien figure’s appearance had worked upon his imagination, or that some other physical or mental influence was at play, he suddenly became conscious, to his surprise, of a strange expansion within him, a kind of roving unease, a youthful thirst for distance. This was so vital and new—or at least so long ago outgrown and forgotten—that he stopped in his tracks with his head down and his hands behind his back to ponder what this sensation was and where it was heading. It was the desire to get away, nothing more, though it veritably attacked him in the form of a visual longing, a near hallucination. Craving had gained the power of sight, and his imagination, which had still not calmed down after his hours of hard work, was creating for itself a single emblematic scene, laboring to picture all the wonders and terrors of the multifarious world at one and the same time. He saw . . . saw a landscape, a tropical swamp under a sky thick with vapor, damp, lush and monstrous, a kind of primeval wilderness of islands, bogs and sediment-carrying channels . . . saw hairy trunks of palm trees pushing up near and far from fecund tangles of fern and beds of oily, swollen, outlandishly blooming flora . . . saw bizarrely deformed trees with roots growing down through the air into the earth, into the green shadows reflected in sluggish floodwaters where, between floating, milky-white flowers the size of plates, birds of some alien species stood in the shadows with hunched shoulders and clumsily shaped beaks and stared immovably off to one side . . . saw through the knotted shoots of a bamboo thicket the glint from the eyes of a crouching tiger . . . and felt his heart pound with horror and inexplicable longing. Then the tiger vision dissolved, and, shaking his head, Aschenbach resumed his deliberate walking along the stonemasons’ fences."
"Da er also die Aufgaben, mit denen sein Talent ihn belud, auf zarten Schultern tragen und weit gehen wollte, so bedurfte er höchlich der Zucht,—und Zucht war ja zum Glücke sein eingeborenes Erbteil von väterlicher Seite. Mit vierzig, mit fünfzig Jahren wie schon in einem Alter, wo andere verschwenden, schwärmen, die Ausführung großer Pläne getrost verschieben, begann er seinen Tag beizeiten mit Stürzen kalten Wassers über Brust und Rücken und brachte dann, ein Paar hoher Wachskerzen in silbernen Leuchtern zu Häupten des Manuskripts, die Kräfte, die er im Schlaf gesammelt, in zwei oder drei inbrünstig gewissenhaften Morgenstunden der Kunst zum Opfer dar. Es war verzeihlich, ja, es bedeutete recht eigentlich den Sieg seiner Moralität, wenn Unkundige die Maja-Welt oder die epischen Massen, in denen sich Friedrichs Heldenleben entrollte, für das Erzeugnis gedrungener Kraft und eines langen Atems hielten, während sie vielmehr in kleinen Tagewerken aus hundert Einzelinspirationen zur Größe emporgeschichtet und nur darum so durchaus und an jedem Punkte vortrefflich waren, weil ihr Schöpfer mit einer Willensdauer und Zähigkeit, derjenigen ähnlich, die seine Heimatprovinz eroberte, jahrelang unter der Spannung eines und desselben Werkes ausgehalten und an die eigentliche Herstellung ausschließlich seine stärksten und würdigsten Stunden gewandt hatte.","Since he wanted to carry the tasks with which his talent charged him on gentle shoulders and go far, he was in great need of discipline—and discipline, fortunately, was his native inheritance from his father. At forty, at fifty, as at an age when others squander, rave, confidently postpone the execution of great plans, he began his day early with sloshes of cold water over his chest and back, and then spent a pair of tall wax candles in silver candlesticks head of the manuscript, sacrificed the powers he had gathered in his sleep in two or three fervently conscientious morning hours to art. It was forgivable, yes, it really meant the victory of his morality, when uninformed people explored the world of Maya or the epic Masses, in which Frederick's heroic life unfolded, considered the product of stubborn strength and staying power, while they were rather piled up in small daily works from a hundred individual inspirations to greatness and were only so thorough and excellent at every point because their creator had a will and toughness similar to that which conquered his native province, years under tension endured one and the same work and devoted only his strongest and most worthwhile hours to the actual production.","Since he must carry the responsibilities of his talent on frail shoulders, and wanted to go a long way, the primary requirement was discipline—and fortunately discipline was his direct inheritance from his father's side. By forty, fifty, or at an earlier age when others are still slashing about with enthusiasm, and are contentedly putting off to some later date the execution of plans on a large scale, he would start the day early, dashing cold water over his chest and back, and then with a couple of tall wax candles in silver candlesticks at the head of his manuscript, he would pay out to his art, in two or three eager, scrupulous morning hours, the strength which he had accumulated in sleep. It was pardonable, indeed it was a direct tribute to the effectiveness of his moral scheme, that the uninitiated took his Maya world, and the massive epic machinery upon which the life of the hero Frederick was unrolled, as evidence of long breath and sustaining power. While actually they had been built up layer by layer, in small daily allotments, through hundreds and hundreds of single inspirations. And if they were so excellent in both composition and texture, it was solely because their creator had held out for years under the strain of one single work, with a steadiness of will and a tenacity comparable to that which conquered his native province; and because, finally, he had turned over his most vital and valuable hours to the problem of minute revision.","Wishing to bear on such frail shoulders the burdens imposed by his talent and wishing to go far, he had great need of discipline, and discipline was fortunately an inborn quality he had inherited from his father’s side of the family. At forty, at fifty, and even when younger, at an age when others dissipate their talents, wax rhapsodic, or blissfully defer their grand projects, he would start his day early by dashing cold water over his chest and back; then, having set a pair of tall wax candles in silver holders at the head of his manuscript, he would spend two or three fervent, conscientious hours offering up to art the strength he had garnered in sleep. It was a forgivable error—indeed, it betokened a victory for his moral stance—that the uninitiated should take the world of his Maya or the epic background against which Frederick’s feats unfolded as the product of prodigious strength and unending stamina, but in fact they grew out of daily increments of hundreds upon hundreds of bits of inspiration, and the only reason they were so perfect—overall and in every detail—was that their creator had held out for years under the strain of a single work with a fortitude and tenacity analogous to those Frederick had used to conquer his native province, and that he had devoted only his most vibrant and vital hours to its composition.","In order to carry the burdens talent had loaded upon his frail shoulders and to travel the great distances he wanted with them, he needed discipline. This he was lucky enough to inherit from his father’s side of the family. As a forty- or fifty-year-old, at that age when others begin to squander, daydream and self-contentedly postpone the execution of great plans, he would start his morning off early, with splashes of cold water across his chest and down his back. Then he would work for two or three ardently conscientious hours by the light of a pair of tall candles in silver holders at the head of his manuscript, sacrificing to art all the strength he had gathered from sleep. It was pardonable—in fact it was actually a mark of the great triumph of his work ethic—that noninitiates often mistook the world of his Maya or the epic blocks in which Frederick’s heroic life unfolded for products of coiled strength and a massive wind. In reality such lofty edifices had been built up piecemeal, layer for layer, from hundreds of isolated inspirations, the whole and each of its parts only attaining such excellence because their creator possessed an iron-willed tenacity such as had once conquered his native Silesia and had endured the strain of year-long labor on one lone project, devoting exclusively his strongest, worthiest hours to the actual production process."
"Einige Tage später verließ Gustav von Aschenbach, da er sich leidend fühlte, das Bäder-Hotel zu späterer Morgenstunde als gewöhnlich. Er hatte mit gewissen, nur halb körperlichen Schwindelanfällen zu kämpfen, die von einer heftig aufsteigenden Angst und Ratlosigkeit begleitet waren, einem Gefühl der Ausweg-und Aussichtslosigkeit, von dem nicht klar wurde, ob es sich auf die äußere Welt oder auf seine eigene Existenz bezog. In der Halle bemerkte er eine große Menge zum Transport bereitliegenden Gepäcks, fragte einen Türhüter, wer es sei, der reise, und erhielt zur Antwort den polnischen Adelsnamen, dessen er insgeheim gewärtig gewesen war. Er empfing ihn, ohne daß seine verfallenen Gesichtszüge sich verändert hätten, mit jener kurzen Hebung des Kopfes, mit der man etwas, was man nicht zu wissen brauchte, beiläufig zur Kenntnis nimmt, und fragte noch: »Wann?« Man antwortete ihm: »Nach dem Lunch.« Er nickte und ging zum Meere.","A few days later Gustav von Aschenbach left the Baeder Hotel later in the morning than usual because he felt ill. He was struggling with certain, only semi-physical, dizzy spells, which were accompanied by violently rising fear and helplessness, a feeling of hopelessness and hopelessness, which it was not clear whether related to the outside world or to his own existence . In the hall he noticed a large quantity of baggage ready for transport, asked a doorman who it was who was traveling, and received in reply the Polish noble name which he had secretly known. He received him without changing his decrepit features, with that brief lift of the head with which one casually acknowledges something one does not need to know, and then asked: ""When?"" They answered him: "" After lunch.” He nodded and went to the sea.","A few days later, as Gustav von Aschenbach was not feeling well, he left the beach hotel at a later hour in the morning than usual. He had to fight against certain attacks of vertigo which were only partially physical and were accompanied by a pronounced malaise, a feeling of bafflement and hopelessness—while he was not certain whether this had to do with conditions outside him or with his own nature. In the lobby he noticed a large pile of luggage ready for shipment; he asked the door-keeper who it was that was leaving, and heard in answer the Polish title which he had learned secretly. He accepted this without any alteration of his sunken features, with that curt elevation of the head by which one acknowledges something he does not need to know. Then he asked, ""When?"" The answer was, ""After lunch."" He nodded, and went to the beach.","Several days thereafter Gustav von Aschenbach left the Hôtel des Bains later in the morning than usual, as he had been feeling indisposed. He was suffering from dizzy spells that were only partly physical: they were accompanied by a precipitously mounting anxiety and feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, though whether those feelings were contingent upon the outside world or his own existence was unclear. He noticed a large assemblage of luggage waiting to be dispatched in the lobby, asked a doorman which guests were departing, and was given the aristocratic Polish name he had secretly expected to hear. He received the news with no change in his sunken features but with that slight lift of the head one uses to show one has registered something one does not need to know, and then asked, “When?” “After lunch,” he was told, and he nodded and went down to the sea.","Several days later Gustav von Aschenbach, feeling sick, left the beach hotel later than usual in the morning. He had been forced to battle against definite, if only semiphysical, attacks of nausea, which were accompanied by an acute mounting anxiety, a feeling of hopelessness and futility impossible to pinpoint either to the world at large or to his own personal life. In the lobby he noticed a great many bags standing ready for departure. He asked a doorman who was traveling on and received as an answer the aristocratic Polish family name he had secretly been expecting. He took in the information without a flinch of his sunken features, curtly raising his chin as people do to acknowledge learning something they didn’t need to know, and added: “When?” The answer came: “After lunch.” He nodded and walked down to the sea."
"Er mußte stehen bleiben, wenn sie sich verweilten, mußte in Garküchen und Höfe flüchten, um die Umkehrenden vorüber zu lassen; er verlor sie, suchte erhitzt und erschöpft nach ihnen über Brücken und in schmutzigen Sackgassen und erduldete Minuten tödlicher Pein, wenn er sie plötzlich in enger Passage, wo kein Ausweichen möglich war, sich entgegenkommen sah. Dennoch kann man nicht sagen, daß er litt. Haupt und Herz waren ihm trunken, und seine Schritte folgten den Weisungen des Dämons, dem es Lust ist, des Menschen Vernunft und Würde unter seine Füße zu treten.","He had to stop when they lingered, had to flee to cookshops and courtyards to let those turning back pass; he lost them, hot and weary he searched for them over bridges and in filthy cul-de-sacs, enduring minutes of mortal torment when he suddenly saw them coming toward him in narrow passages where there was no avoidance. Yet one cannot say that he suffered. His head and heart were intoxicated, and his steps followed the instructions of the demon, who takes pleasure in trampling on human reason and dignity under his feet.","He had to stand still when they stopped, had to take flight in shops and courts to let them pass when they turned back. He lost them; hot and exhausted, he hunted them over bridges and down dirty blind-alleys—and he underwent minutes of deadly agony when suddenly he saw them coming towards him in a narrow passage where escape was impossible. Yet it could not be said that he suffered. He was drunk, and his steps followed the promptings of the demon who delights in treading human reason and dignity under foot.","He had to stop when they tarried, duck into food stalls and courtyards when they doubled back; he would lose them, pursue them, hot and exhausted, over bridges and along filthy culs-de-sac, and endure moments of mortal shame when seeing them suddenly come towards him in a narrow passageway from which there was no escape. Yet it cannot be said he was suffering: he was drunk in both head and heart, and his steps followed the dictates of the demon whose delight it is to trample human reason and dignity underfoot.","He had to stop whenever they lingered, had to duck into snack shops and courtyards every time they changed direction; he would lose them and search in frantic exhaustion, over bridges and in dirty dead-end alleys, only to endure minutes of mortal agony whenever he suddenly spotted them coming toward him in a narrow passage with no possible escape. Nonetheless, you couldn’t say that he suffered. His head and his heart were drunk, and his steps were directed by that demon who takes pleasure at trampling man’s reason and dignity underfoot."
"Bald kannte der Betrachtende jede Linie und Pose dieses so gehobenen, so frei sich darstellenden Körpers, begrüßte freudig jede schon vertraute Schönheit aufs Neue und fand der Bewunderung, der zarten Sinneslust kein Ende. Man rief den Knaben, einen Gast zu begrüßen, der den Frauen bei der Hütte aufwartete; er lief herbei, lief naß vielleicht aus der Flut, er warf die Locken, und indem er die Hand reichte, auf einem Beine ruhend, den anderen Fuß auf die Zehenspitzen gestellt, hatte er eine reizende Drehung und Wendung des Körpers, anmutig spannungsvoll, verschämt aus Liebenswürdigkeit, gefallsüchtig aus adeliger Pflicht. Er lag ausgestreckt, das Badetuch um die Brust geschlungen, den zart gemeißelten Arm in den Sand gestützt, das Kinn in der hohlen Hand; der, welcher »Jaschu« gerufen wurde, saß kauernd bei ihm und tat ihm schön, und nichts konnte bezaubernder sein, als das Lächeln der Augen und Lippen, mit dem der Ausgezeichnete zu dem Geringeren, Dienenden aufblickte. Er stand am Rande der See, allein, abseits von den Seinen, ganz nahe bei Aschenbach,—aufrecht, die Hände im Nacken verschlungen, langsam sich auf den Fußballen schaukelnd, und träumte ins Blaue, während kleine Wellen, die anliefen, seine Zehen badeten. Sein honigfarbenes Haar schmiegte sich in Ringeln an die Schläfen und in den Nacken, die Sonne erleuchtete den Flaum des oberen Rückgrates, die feine Zeichnung der Rippen, das Gleichmaß der Brust traten durch die knappe Umhüllung des Rumpfes hervor, seine Achselhöhlen waren noch glatt wie bei einer Statue, seine Kniekehlen glänzten, und ihr bläuliches Geäder ließ seinen Körper wie aus klarerem Stoffe gebildet erscheinen. Welch eine Zucht, welche Präzision des Gedankens war ausgedrückt in diesem gestreckten und jugendlich vollkommenen Leibe! Der strenge und reine Wille jedoch, der, dunkel tätig, dies göttliche Bildwerk ans Licht zu treiben vermocht hatte,—war er nicht ihm, dem Künstler, bekannt und vertraut? Wirkte er nicht auch in ihm, wenn er, besonnener Leidenschaft voll, aus der Marmormasse der Sprache die schlanke Form befreite, die er im Geiste geschaut und die er als Standbild und Spiegel geistiger Schönheit den Menschen darstellte?","Soon the viewer knew every line and pose of this so elevated, so freely presented body, joyfully greeted every new beauty that was already familiar, and found no end to the admiration, the tender sensual pleasure. The boy was called to greet a guest who was waiting for the women at the hut; he ran up, perhaps ran wet out of the tide, he tossed his curls, and holding out his hand, resting on one leg, the other foot on tiptoe, he had a lovely twist and turn of the body, gracefully tense, bashful out of kindness, coquettish out of noble duty. He lay stretched out, his towel wrapped around his chest, his delicately chiseled arm propped on the sand, his chin in his cupped hands; the one who was called ""Jaschu"" sat crouching by him and did him good, and nothing could be more enchanting than the smile on the eyes and lips with which the distinguished one looked up at the lesser, servant. He stood at the edge of the sea, alone, away from his family, very close to Aschenbach—upright, his hands clasped behind his neck, slowly rocking himself on the balls of his feet, and daydreamed in the blue while little waves that rushed in bathed his toes . His honey-colored hair nestled in ringlets on his temples and on the back of his neck, the sun illuminated the downy down of his upper spine, the fine drawing of his ribs, the regularity of his chest stood out through the tight covering of his torso, his armpits were still smooth as with of a statue, the hollows of his knees gleamed, and her bluish veins made his body seem made of clearer stuff. What discipline, what precision of thought was expressed in this stretched and youthfully perfect body! The strict and pure will, however, which, working obscurely, had been able to bring this divine sculpture to light—was it not known and familiar to him, the artist? Wasn't it also working in him when, full of calm passion, he freed from the marble mass of language the slender form which he had seen in his spirit and which he presented to man as a statue and mirror of spiritual beauty?","This piquant body was so freely exhibited that his eyes soon knew every line and posture. He was continually rediscovering with new pleasure all this familiar beauty, and his astonishment at its delicate appeal to his senses was unending. The boy was called to greet a guest who was paying his respects to the ladies at the bathing house. He came running, running wet perhaps out of the water, tossed back his curls, and as he held out his hand, resting on one leg and raising his other foot on the toes, the set of his body was delightful; it had a charming expectancy about it, a well-meaning shyness, a winsomeness which showed his aristocratic training. . . . He lay stretched full length, his bath towel slung across his shoulders, his delicately chiselled arm supported in the sand, his chin in his palm; the boy called Jaschu was squatting near him and making up to him—and nothing could be more enchanting than the smile of his eyes and lips when the leader glanced up at his inferior, his servant. . . . He stood on the edge of the sea, alone, apart from his people, quite near to Aschenbach—erect, his hands locked across the back of his neck, he swayed slowly on the balls of his feet, looked dreamily into the blueness of sea and sky, while tiny waves rolled up and bathed his feet. His honey-coloured hair clung in rings about his neck and temples. The sun made the down on his back glitter; the fine etching of the ribs, the symmetry of the chest, were emphasized by the tightness of the suit across the buttocks. His arm-pits were still as smooth as those of a statue; the hollows of his knees glistened, and their bluish veins made his body seem built of some clearer stuff. What rigour, what precision of thought, were expressed in this erect, youthfully perfect body! Yet the pure and strenuous will which, darkly at work, could bring such godlike sculpture to the light—was not he, the artist, familiar with this? Did it not operate in him too when he, under the press of frugal passions, would free from the marble mass of speech some slender form which he had seen in the mind and which he put before his fellows as a statue and a mirror of intellectual beauty?","Soon the observer knew every line and pose of that body so noble, so freely exposed, joyfully welcoming anew each already familiar aspect of his beauty, and his wonderment and delicate sensual delight knew no bounds. Summoned to greet a guest paying his respects to the ladies at the cabana, the boy would run up out of the water—dripping wet perhaps, tossing back his curls—hold out his hand and—one foot planted on the ground, the other on tiptoe—execute a charming twist and turn of the body, gracefully restless, graciously diffident, and obliging from a sense of noblesse oblige. He would lie full length with his towel wrapped round his chest, a delicately chiseled arm resting in the sand, a hand cupping the chin, while the boy addressed as Jasiu squatted at his side, playing up to him, and there could be nothing more tantalizing than the smiling eyes and lips of the chosen one looking up at his inferior, his servant. He would stand at the edge of the sea, alone, removed from his family, quite near Aschenbach, erect, his hands clasped behind his neck, slowly rocking on the balls of his feet, staring out into the blue in reverie, while little waves rolled up and bathed his toes. The honey-colored hair fell gracefully in ringlets at the temples and the back of the neck, the sun glimmered in the down of the upper spine, the fine delineation of the ribs and symmetry of the chest stood out through the torso’s scanty cover, the armpits were still as smooth as a statue’s, the hollows of the knees glistened, and their bluish veins made the body look translucent. What discipline, what precision of thought was conveyed by that tall, youthfully perfect physique! Yet the austere and pure will laboring in obscurity to bring the godlike statue to light—was it not known to him, familiar to him as an artist? Was it not at work in him when, chiseling with sober passion at the marble block of language, he released the slender form he had beheld in his mind and would present to the world as an effigy and mirror of spiritual beauty?","Soon the observant Aschenbach knew every line and pose of this so superior, uninhibited body, joyously welcoming each feature of its already familiar beauty anew and knowing no end for either his admiration or the gentle desire of his senses. A voice might summon the boy to greet a guest waiting upon the women at their hut. He would run by, perhaps wet from the sea, tossing his locks, and as he shook hands, he would rotate his body in a most charming way, in one graceful taut twist—one leg bearing his full weight, the other extending its toes—embarrassed at being so adorable, anxious to fulfill his aristocratic duty and please the visitor. Or he might lie outstretched, a beach towel wrapped around his chest, his finely sculpted arm braced in the sand, his hand cupping his chin. The one called “Yashu” would squat to the side, doting on him, and nothing could have been more enchanting than the chosen one, with a smile in his eyes and on his lips, looking up at his vassal, his servant. Or he might stand there at the edge of the sea, alone, away from his family, quite near Aschenbach, tall, slowly rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet, his hands clasped behind his neck, dreaming off into the blue, while tiny in-rolling waves bathed his toes. His honey-colored hair curled in ringlets around his temples and neck, the down on his upper spine gleamed in the sun, the fine contours of his ribs and his even chest emerged through the thin wrapping around his torso, his armpits ran smooth as a statue’s, the hollows of his knees glistened and, thanks to their bluish veins, his entire body appeared to be made of some more translucent material. What discipline, what precision of thought was expressed in this youthful body, stretched out in all its perfection! The strength and purity of that will, whose obscure activity had succeeded in realizing this divine sculpture—did not he, as artist, know it through and through? Was it not also at work within him, as he chipped away, full of sober passion, at the marble block of language to release that sleek form glimpsed in his imagination, which he then presented to his fellow man as a model and mirror of sublime beauty?"
"Dennoch fehlte es nicht an Augenblicken des Innehaltens und der halben Besinnung. Auf welchen Wegen! dachte er dann mit Bestürzung. Auf welchen Wegen! Wie jeder Mann, dem natürliche Verdienste ein aristokratisches Interesse für seine Abstammung einflößen, war er gewohnt, bei den Leistungen und Erfolgen seines Lebens der Vorfahren zu gedenken, sich ihrer Zustimmung, ihrer Genugtuung, ihrer notgedrungenen Achtung im Geiste zu versichern. Er dachte ihrer auch jetzt und hier, verstrickt in ein so unstatthaftes Erlebnis, begriffen in so exotischen Ausschweifungen des Gefühls; gedachte der haltungsvollen Strenge, der anständigen Männlichkeit ihres Wesens und lächelte schwermütig. Was würden sie sagen? Aber freilich, was hätten sie zu seinem ganzen Leben gesagt, das von dem ihren so bis zur Entartung abgewichen war, zu diesem Leben im Banne der Kunst, über das er selbst einst, im Bürgersinne der Väter, so spöttische Jünglingserkenntnisse hatte verlauten lassen und das dem ihren im Grunde so ähnlich gewesen war! Auch er hatte gedient, auch er sich in harter Zucht geübt; auch er war Soldat und Kriegsmann gewesen, gleich manchen von ihnen,—denn die Kunst war ein Krieg, ein aufreibender Kampf, für welchen man heute nicht lange taugte. Ein Leben der Selbstüberwindung und des Trotzdem, ein herbes, standhaftes und enthaltsames Leben, das er zum Sinnbild für einen zarten und zeitgemäßen Heroismus gestaltet hatte,—wohl durfte er es männlich, durfte es tapfer nennen, und es wollte ihm scheinen, als sei der Eros, der sich seiner bemeistert, einem solchen Leben auf irgendeine Weise besonders gemäß und geneigt. Hatte er nicht bei den tapfersten Völkern vorzüglich in Ansehen gestanden, ja, hieß es nicht, daß er durch Tapferkeit in ihren Städten geblüht habe? Zahlreiche Kriegshelden der Vorzeit hatten willig sein Joch getragen, denn gar keine Erniedrigung galt, die der Gott verhängte, und Taten, die als Merkmale der Feigheit wären gescholten worden, wenn sie um anderer Zwecke willen geschehen wären: Fußfälle, Schwüre, inständige Bitten und sklavisches Wesen, solche gereichten dem Liebenden nicht zur Schande, sondern er erntete vielmehr noch Lob dafür.","Nevertheless, there was no lack of moments of pause and half-reflection. In what ways! he thought then with dismay. In what ways! Like every man whose natural merit inspires an aristocratic interest in his lineage, he was accustomed to remembering his ancestors in the accomplishments and successes of his life, to mentally securing their approval, their satisfaction, their inevitable respect. He thought of her here and now, entangled in such an inadmissible experience, caught up in such exotic excesses of feeling; thought of the restrained austerity, the decent masculinity of her nature and smiled melancholy. what would you say But of course, what would they have said about his whole life, which had deviated from theirs to the point of degeneracy, about this life under the spell of art, about which he himself had once, in the civic sense of his fathers, let such mocking youthful remarks be heard and all that basically so similar to hers! He too had served, he too had practiced hard discipline; he, too, had been a soldier and a man of war, like some of them—for art was a war, a grueling struggle for which one was not fit for long today. A life of self-conquest and defiance, a harsh, steadfast and abstemious life, which he had fashioned into a symbol for a tender and contemporary heroism—he was allowed to call it manly, brave, and it seemed to him that he was Eros mastering himself, in some way particularly suited and inclined to such a life. Hadn't he been well respected by the bravest peoples, yes, wasn't it said that through bravery he had flourished in their cities? Numerous war-heroes of old had willingly borne his yoke, for no humiliation was inflicted by the god, and acts which, had they been done for other purposes, would have been reproached as marks of cowardice: footfalls, oaths, entreaties, and slavery Beings, such did not bring shame to the lover, but rather he earned praise for it.","Yet there were still moments of relief when he came partly to his senses. "" Where to!"" he would think, alarmed. "" Where to!"" Like every man whose natural abilities stimulate an aristocratic interest in his ancestry, he was accustomed to think of his forbears in connexion with the accomplishments and successes of his life, to assure himself of their approval, their satisfaction, their undeniable respect. He thought of them now, entangled as he was in such an illicit experience, caught in such exotic transgressions. He thought of their characteristic rigidity of principle, their scrupulous masculinity—and he smiled dejectedly. What would they say? But then, what would they have said to his whole life, which was almost degenerate in its departure from theirs, this life under the bane of art—a life against which he himself had once issued such youthful mockeries out of loyalty to his fathers, but which at bottom had been so much like theirs! He too had served, he too had been a soldier and a warrior like many of them—for art was a war, a destructive battle, and one was not equal to it for long these days. A life of self-conquest and of in-spite-offs, a rigid, sober, and unyielding life which he had formed into the symbol of a delicate and timely heroism. He might well call it masculine, or brave; and it almost seemed as though the Eros mastering him were somehow peculiarly adapted and inclined to such a life. Had not this Eros stood in high repute among the bravest of peoples; was it not true that precisely through bravery he had flourished in their cities? Numerous war heroes of antiquity had willingly borne his yoke, for nothing was deemed a disgrace which the god imposed; and acts which would Have been rebuked as the sign of cowardice if they had been done for other purposes—prostrations, oaths, entreaties, abjectness—such things did not bring shame upon the lover, but rather he reaped praise for them.","Yet he still had moments of pause and near lucidity. Where is this taking me? he would think then with alarm. Where is this taking me? Like any man whose natural gifts aroused an aristocratic interest in his ancestry, he habitually called to mind his forebears during his periods of achievement and success, assuring himself of their approval, gratification, and ineluctable esteem. He thought of them again here and now —enmeshed as he was in so illicit an experience, involved in such exotic extravagances of emotion— thought of their imposing fortitude, their upstanding manliness of character and gave a dour smile. What would they say? But what for that matter would they have said about his life as a whole, a life diverging from theirs to the point of degeneracy, lived under the spell of art, a life about which he himself, in line with the bourgeois disposition of those forefathers, had made mocking pronouncements as a young man, yet which basically so resembled their own! He too had served; he too, like so many of them, had been soldier and warrior, for art was war, a grueling struggle that people these days were not up to for long. A life of self-domination, of “despites,” a grim, dogged, abstemious life he had shaped into the emblem of a frail heroism for the times—might he not call it manly, might he not call it brave? Besides, he had the feeling that the eros which had taken possession of him was in a way singularly appropriate and suited to such a life. Had it not been held in particular esteem amongst the bravest of nations? Indeed, was it not said to have flourished in their cities as a consequence of bravery? Countless warrior heroes in older times had willingly borne its yoke, for no action imposed by a god could be deemed humiliating, and actions that might otherwise have been condemned as signs of cowardice—genuflections, oaths, importunate supplications, and servile behavior—such actions were accounted no shame to a lover but rather earned him praise.","Nonetheless, he did have moments of introspection and partial consideration of potential consequences. How far! he would think at such moments, crestfallen. How far he’d come! Like any man in whom natural merit has instilled an aristocratic interest in personal ancestry, Aschenbach often thought about his forefathers in times of achievement and triumph, assuring himself of their imagined approval, their satisfaction and hard-won respect. He thought of them also here and now, entangled as he was in such an unseemly adventure, in the grip of such exotic emotional extravagance. He recalled their dignified severity, the respectable masculinity that was their very essence, and smiled gravely. What would they say? But then again, what would they have said about his whole life, which deviated from theirs to the point of degeneracy, this life under the spell of art, which he himself, speaking from his ancestors’ perspective of civic responsibility, had once publicly ridiculed in a youthful polemic and which nonetheless had been so fundamentally similar to their own? He, too, had served. He, too, had been a soldier and a warrior like many of them—for art was war, a gritty struggle full of wear and tear to which these days it was hard to stay long equal. A life of self-conquest, a life “in spite of,” dry, steadfast and abstinent, which he had transformed into a model for the frail heroism of the times—he was well entitled to call it masculine, to call it courageous. It seemed to him that the Eros that had overcome him was somehow especially suited and inclined to this sort of life. Hadn’t the god enjoyed an excellent reputation among the bravest of peoples? Indeed, was it not written that he had thrived in their cities on account of his courage? Various heroic warriors of yore had willingly borne his yoke, for nothing ordained by God could bring disgrace, and actions that would have been castigated as signs of cowardice, had one engaged in them for other reasons—kneeling, oaths, desperate pleading and slavish protestation—such things brought no shame to the lover. On the contrary, one reaped great praise for them."
"Neuerdings begnügte er sich nicht damit, Nähe und Anblick des Schönen der Tagesregel und dem Glücke zu danken; er verfolgte ihn, er stellte ihm nach. Sonntags zum Beispiel erschienen die Polen niemals am Strande; er erriet, daß sie die Messe in San Marco besuchten, er eilte dorthin, und aus der Glut des Platzes in die goldene Dämmerung des Heiligtums eintretend, fand er den Entbehrten, über ein Betpult gebeugt beim Gottesdienst. Dann stand er im Hintergrunde, auf zerklüftetem Mosaikboden, inmitten knieenden, murmelnden, kreuzschlagenden Volkes, und die gedrungene Pracht des morgenländischen Tempels lastete üppig auf seinen Sinnen. Vorn wandelte, hantierte und sang der schwergeschmückte Priester, Weihrauch quoll auf, er umnebelte die kraftlosen Flämmchen der Altarkerzen, und in den dumpfsüßen Opferduft schien sich leise ein anderer zu mischen: der Geruch der erkrankten Stadt. Aber durch Dunst und Gefunkel sah Aschenbach, wie der Schöne dort vorn den Kopf wandte, ihn suchte und ihn erblickte.","Lately he has not contented himself with thanking the nearness and sight of beauty, the rule of the day, and luck; he pursued him, he pursued him. On Sundays, for example, the Poles never appeared on the beach; he guessed that they were attending mass in San Marco, he hurried there, and emerging from the glow of the square into the golden twilight of the sanctuary, he found the deprived man bent over a prayer desk at the service. Then he stood in the background, on a jagged mosaic floor, in the midst of kneeling, murmuring, cross-beating people, and the squat splendor of the oriental temple weighed heavily on his senses. In front the heavily decorated priest walked, worked and sang, incense rose up, it misted the feeble flames of the altar candles, and in the dull-sweet sacrificial scent something else seemed to mingle: the smell of the diseased city. But through the haze and the sparkle, Aschenbach saw the handsome man turning his head, looking for him and seeing him.","Lately he had not been relying simply on good luck and the daily routine for his chances to be near the boy and look at him. He pursued him, stalked him. On Sundays, for instance, the Poles never appeared on the beach. He guessed that they must be attending mass at San Marco. He hurried there; and stepping from the heat of the square into the golden twilight of the church, he found the boy he was hunting, bowed over a prie-dieu, praying. Then he stood in the background, on the cracked mosaic floor, with people on all sides kneeling, murmuring, and making the sign of the cross. And the compact grandeur of this oriental temple weighed heavily on his senses. In front, the richly ornamented priest was conducting the office, moving about and singing; incense poured forth, clouding the weak little flame of the candle on the altar—and with the sweet, stuffy sacrificial odour another seemed to commingle faintly: the smell of the infested city. But through the smoke and the sparkle Aschenbach saw how the boy there in front turned his head, hunted him out, and looked at him.","He had not been content of late to leave the possibility of seeing and being near the beautiful boy to chance or daily routine; he had pursued him, tracked him down. On Sundays, for instance, the Poles never came to the beach. Having surmised that they would be attending mass at San Marco, he would hurry there and, entering the golden dusk of the sanctuary from the square’s torrid heat, locate the boy he had so missed, his head bowed at worship over a prie-dieu. He would then stand at the back on the cracked mosaic floor amidst a host of people kneeling, murmuring, and crossing themselves, the massive splendor of the oriental temple weighing opulently on his senses. At the front the heavily bedizened priest walked to and fro, officiating and chanting, the incense billowing up and clouding the feeble flames of the altar tapers, and the sweet and stuffy sacrificial odor seemed to mingle with another: the odor of the diseased city. But through the haze and flicker Aschenbach would see the beautiful boy turn his head, seek him out, and sight him.","By now, he was no longer content to trust daily routine and luck to put the beautiful boy within visible proximity. He had taken to following him, even shadowing him. On Sundays, for example, the Polish family never appeared on the beach. Having guessed that they attended mass at San Marco, he had rushed over and, escaping the Piazza’s midday heat into the golden dusk of that holy shrine, had found the sorely missed Tadzio kneeling over a prie-dieu saying his prayers. Now every week he stood at the rear on the cracked mosaic floor amidst a crowd of kneeling, murmuring and cross-making worshippers, the solid grandeur of the Oriental basilica impressing itself upon him in all its opulence. Up front the ornately vested priest walked back and forth, handling objects and singing, billowing incense enshrouded the tiny hapless flames of the votive candles, and another faint scent seemed to mingle with the musty, sweetly sacrificial air: the odor of the contaminated city. But through the smoke and twinkling lights Aschenbach could see the beautiful boy up in front turn his head and search him out."
"In der vierten Woche seines Aufenthalts auf dem Lido machte Gustav von Aschenbach einige die Außenwelt betreffende unheimliche Wahrnehmungen. Erstens schien es ihm, als ob bei steigender Jahreszeit die Frequenz seines Gasthofes eher ab-als zunähme, und, insbesondere, als ob die deutsche Sprache um ihn her versiege und verstumme, so daß bei Tisch und am Strand endlich nur noch fremde Laute sein Ohr trafen. Eines Tages dann fing er beim Coiffeur, den er jetzt häufig besuchte, im Gespräche ein Wort auf, das ihn stutzig machte. Der Mann hatte einer deutschen Familie erwähnt, die soeben nach kurzem Verweilen abgereist war und setzte plaudernd und schmeichelnd hinzu: »Sie bleiben, mein Herr; Sie haben keine Furcht vor dem Übel.« Aschenbach sah ihn an. »Dem Übel?« wiederholte er. Der Schwätzer verstummte, tat beschäftigt, überhörte die Frage, und als sie dringlicher gestellt ward, erklärte er, er wisse von nichts und suchte mit verlegener Beredsamkeit abzulenken.","In the fourth week of his stay on the Lido, Gustav von Aschenbach made some uncanny observations concerning the outside world. First of all, it seemed to him as if the frequency of his inn decreased rather than increased with the rising season, and, in particular, as if the German language around him dried up and fell silent, so that at last at table and on the beach only unfamiliar sounds could be heard met Then one day, while talking to the hairdresser, whom he now frequented, he caught a word that made him suspicious. The man had mentioned a German family who had just left after a short stay, and added chatteringly and flatteringly: ""You stay, sir; You have no fear of evil.” Aschenbach looked at him. ""The evil?"" he repeated. The chatterer fell silent, pretended to be busy, ignored the question, and when it was more urgently asked, declared that he knew nothing, and tried to divert attention with embarrassed eloquence.","During his fourth week at the Lido Gustav von Aschenbach made several sinister observations touching on the world about him. First, it seemed to him that as the season progressed the number of guests at the hotel was diminishing rather than increasing; and German especially seemed to be dropping away, so that finally he heard nothing but foreign sounds at table and on the beach. Then one day in conversation with the barber, whom he visited often, he caught a word which startled him. The man had mentioned a German family that left soon after their arrival; he added glibly and flatteringly, ""But you are staying, sir. You have no fear of the plague. "" Aschenbach looked at him. "" The plague?"" he repeated. The gossiper was silent, made out as though busy with other things, ignored the question. When it was put more insistently, he declared that he knew nothing, and with embarrassing volubility he tried to change the subject.","During the fourth week of his stay at the Lido, Gustav von Aschenbach observed some peculiar developments taking place in the world around him. First of all, it struck him that even as the season advanced, the number of guests at his hotel was falling rather than rising and, in particular, the use of German around him had so ebbed and waned that the only sounds reaching his ear at meals and on the beach were foreign. Then one day while conversing with the barber, whom he now patronized frequently, he gleaned a rather unsettling piece of news. Having mentioned a German family that had just departed after a short stay, he added in his chatty, unctuous manner, “But you are staying on, sir. You have no fear of the disease.” Aschenbach looked at him. “The disease?” The prattler did not reply, acted busy, disregarded the question, and when it was put to him with more urgency he claimed to know nothing and attempted with embarrassed eloquence to change the subject.","During the fourth week of his stay on the Lido, Gustav von Aschenbach made several troubling realizations concerning the world at large. To begin with, it seemed to him as if, with the height of the tourist season approaching, the number of guests were actually on the decline, and in particular as if the German language were fading into silence around him, to the point where, whether at his table or on the beach, only foreign sounds reached his ear. Then one day in conversation with the coiffeur, to whom he was now paying regular visits, he seized upon a word that aroused his suspicions. The man mentioned a German family who had departed suddenly after a short stay, adding as a bit of conversational flattery: “But you’re staying, sir. You’re not scared of any affliction.” Aschenbach looked at him. “Affliction,” he repeated. The gossip fell silent, fiddled with something, ignored the question. Then, when Aschenbach posed it again, more forcefully, he declared he knew nothing and tried with sheepish eloquence to change the subject."
"Der Platz lag in sonnenloser Schwüle. Unwissende Fremde saßen vor den Cafés oder standen, ganz von Tauben bedeckt, vor der Kirche und sahen zu, wie die Tiere, wimmelnd, flügelschlagend, einander verdrängend, nach den in hohlen Händen dargebotenen Maiskörnern pickten. In fiebriger Erregung, triumphierend im Besitze der Wahrheit, einen Geschmack von Ekel dabei auf der Zunge und ein phantastisches Grauen im Herzen, schritt der Einsame die Fliesen des Prachthofes auf und nieder. Er erwog eine reinigende und anständige Handlung. Er konnte heute Abend nach dem Diner der perlengeschmückten Frau sich nähern und zu ihr sprechen, was er wörtlich entwarf: »Gestatten Sie dem Fremden, Madame, Ihnen mit einem Rat, einer Warnung zu dienen, die der Eigennutz Ihnen vorenthält. Reisen Sie ab, sogleich, mit Tadzio und Ihren Töchtern! Venedig ist verseucht.« Er konnte dann dem Werkzeug einer höhnischen Gottheit zum Abschied die Hand aufs Haupt legen, sich wegwenden und diesem Sumpfe entfliehen. Aber er fühlte zugleich, daß er unendlich weit entfernt war, einen solchen Schritt im Ernste zu wollen. Er würde ihn zurückführen, würde ihn sich selber wiedergeben; aber wer außer sich ist, verabscheut nichts mehr, als wieder in sich zu gehen. Er erinnerte sich eines weißen Bauwerks, geschmückt mit abendlich gleißenden Inschriften, in deren durchscheinender Mystik das Auge seines Geistes sich verloren hatte; jener seltsamen Wandrergestalt sodann, die dem Alternden schweifende Jünglingssehnsucht ins Weite und Fremde erweckt hatte; und der Gedanke an Heimkehr, an Besonnenheit, Nüchternheit, Mühsal und Meisterschaft, widerte ihn in solchem Maße, daß sein Gesicht sich zum Ausdruck physischer Übelkeit verzerrte. »Man soll schweigen!« flüsterte er heftig. Und: »Ich werde schweigen!« Das Bewußtsein seiner Mitwisserschaft, seiner Mitschuld berauschte ihn, wie geringe Mengen Weines ein müdes Hirn berauschen. Das Bild der heimgesuchten und verwahrlosten Stadt, wüst seinem Geiste vorschwebend, entzündete in ihm Hoffnungen, unsagbar, die Vernunft überschreitend, und von ungeheuerlicher Süßigkeit. Was war ihm das zarte Glück, von dem er vorhin einen Augenblick geträumt, verglichen mit diesen Erwartungen? Was galt ihm noch Kunst und Tugend gegenüber den Vorteilen des Chaos? Er schwieg und blieb.","The place lay in a sunless, muggy state. Ignorant strangers sat in front of the cafés or stood in front of the church, completely covered with pigeons, and watched as the animals, swarming, flapping their wings, crowding each other out, pecked at the corn kernels offered in cupped hands. Feverishly excited, triumphant in possession of the truth, a taste of disgust on the tongue and a fantastic dread in the heart, the lonely man paced up and down the flagstones of the magnificent courtyard. He considered a purifying and decent action. He was able to approach the beaded woman after dinner tonight and speak to her what he drafted verbatim: 'Allow the stranger, madame, to serve you with an advice, a warning which self-interest withholds from you. Leave, at once, with Tadzio and your daughters! Venice is contaminated.' He could then lay his hand on the head of the tool of a scornful deity in farewell, turn away and escape from this swamp. But at the same time he felt that he was infinitely far from wanting such a step in earnest. He would lead him back, would restore him to himself; but when you're out of your mind, there's nothing you hate more than coming back to yourself. He remembered a white building, adorned with inscriptions gleaming in the evening, in whose translucent mysticism the eye of his spirit had lost itself; then that strange wandering figure that had awakened the aging man's wandering youthful longing for far and wide; and the thought of homecoming, of prudence, sobriety, toil, and mastery, repelled him to such an extent that his face contorted into an expression of physical nausea. ""One should be silent!"" he whispered violently. And: ""I will keep quiet!"" The consciousness of his complicity, his complicity, intoxicated him as small amounts of wine intoxicate a tired brain. The image of the haunted and neglected city, hovering desolately before his mind, kindled in him hopes unspeakable, transcending reason, and of immense sweetness. What was the tender happiness he had dreamed of for a moment compared to these expectations? What was art and virtue worth to him compared to the advantages of chaos? He said nothing and stayed.","The square lay sunless and stifling. Unsuspecting foreigners sat in front of the cafés, or stood among the pigeons in front of the church and watched the swarms of birds flapping their wings, crowding one another, and pecking at grains of corn offered them in open palms. The recluse was feverishly excited, triumphant in his possession of the truth. But it had left him with a bad taste in his mouth, and a weird horror in his heart. As he walked up and down the flagstones of the gorgeous court he was weighing an action which would meet the situation and would absolve him. This evening after dinner he could approach the woman with the pearls and make her a speech; he had figured it out word for word: ""Permit a foreigner, madam, to give you some useful advice, a warning, which is being withheld from you through self-interest. Leave immediately with Tadzio and your daughters! Venice is full of the plague. "" Then he could lay a farewell hand on the head of this tool of a mocking divinity, turn away, and flee this morass. But he felt at the same time that he was very far from seriously desiring such a move. He would retract it, would disengage himself from it. . . . But when we are distracted we loathe most the thought of retracing our steps. He recalled a white building, ornamented with inscriptions which glistened in the evening and in whose transparent mysticism his mind's eye had lost itself—and then that strange wanderer's form which had awakened in the aging man the roving hankerings of youth after the foreign and the remote. And the thought of return, the thought of prudence and soberness, effort, mastery, disgusted him to such an extent that his face was distorted with an expression of physical nausea. ""It must be kept silent!"" he whispered heavily. And: ""I will keep silent!"" The consciousness of his share in the facts and the guilt intoxicated him, much as a little wine intoxicates a tired brain. The picture of the diseased and neglected city hovering desolately before him aroused vague hopes beyond the bounds of reason, but with an egregious sweetness. What was the scant happiness he had dreamed of a moment ago, compared with these expectations? What were art and virtue worth to him, over against the advantages of chaos? He kept silent, and remained in Venice.","The square lay in sunless swelter. Unsuspecting foreigners sat in cafés or stood covered with pigeons in front of the church, watching the birds swarm, beat their wings, or push one another out of the way to peck at the grains of maize they held out in the palms of their hands. Feverish with agitation, triumphant in his possession of the truth, a repulsive taste in his mouth, and fantastic horror in his heart, the solitary traveler paced up and down the flagstones of the magnificent square. He was trying to come up with a decent and purificatory mode of action. After dinner that evening he could go over to the woman in pearls and deliver the speech he was now formulating: “ Permit me, Madam, stranger that I am, to give you a piece of advice, a warning withheld from you by self-serving interests. You must leave, leave immediately, with Tadzio and your daughters! Venice is infested.” He might then lay a farewell hand on the head of that taunting deity’s agent, turn on his heel, and flee the quagmire. Yet at the same time he felt infinitely far from seriously wishing to take such a step. It would lead him back, restore him to himself, but there is nothing so distasteful as being restored to oneself when one is beside oneself. He recalled a white structure adorned with inscriptions glistening in the evening light and beckoning his mind’s eye to lose itself in their pellucid mysticism, then the curious figure of the wayfarer who had aroused a youthful longing for travel and strange, faraway places in an aging man, and the thought of returning home, of coming to his senses, sobering up, resuming his drudgery and craft was so abhorrent to him that his face twisted into an expression of physical revulsion. “Nothing is to be said about it!” he whispered wildly. And added, “I shall say nothing.” The consciousness of his collusion, his share of guilt intoxicated him as small quantities of wine intoxicate the weary brain. The image of the infested and abandoned city throbbing wildly in his mind kindled hopes unfathomable, beyond reason, and outrageously sweet. What was that serene happiness he had dreamed of a moment before compared with such expectations? What were art and virtue to him given the advantages of chaos? He said nothing and stayed on.","The Piazza San Marco lay in overcast humidity. Oblivious foreigners sat in the cafés or stood literally covered by pigeons in front of the cathedral, watching the swarming birds beat their wings and jostle each other to peck at the cupped hands offering corn seed. Feverish with excitement, triumphant in possession of the truth, but also with a disgusting taste on his tongue and an uncanny horror in his heart, the solitary Aschenbach paced up and down the tiles of that splendid square. He was considering an action of cleansing decency. This evening after dinner he would approach the lady with the pearls and deliver the speech he was already rehearsing: “Please permit a stranger to be of service, Madame, and pass along a piece of advice, a warning, about something which is being kept from you out of self-interest. Leave here at once with Tadzio and your daughters! Venice is in the throes of the plague.” Then, as a gesture of farewell, he could lay his hand on the head of that instrument of a scornful divinity and turn around and flee this miserable swamp himself. At the same time, however, he sensed how infinitely far he was from any genuine desire to take such a step. It would lead him back, restore him to himself, but when you’re beside yourself, the last thing you want is come to in this way. He recalled a white building adorned with inscriptions glinting in the twilight in whose radiant mysticism his mind’s eye had wandered about. He remembered the strange traveler who had awakened in him at his advanced age an errant youthful desire for distance and exotic surroundings. And the thought of returning home—of self-control, sobriety, labor and expertise—revolted him so deeply that his face took on a look of physical illness. “It’s to be kept quiet!” he whispered vehemently. “Then I’ll keep it quiet.” Consciousness of his shared knowledge, shared guilt, intoxicated him in precisely the way that small quantities of wine can intoxicate a tired mind. The image of the disease-stricken, decimated city suspended desolate in his imagination raised hopes that were incomprehensible, beyond all rational understanding, abominably sweet. What was the delicate happiness of which he had just now dreamt for an instant, measured against prospects like these? What good were art and virtue to him, he who enjoyed the prospects of chaos? He kept quiet and stayed on."
Und über ihn hinsehend antwortete der Gondolier:,And looking over him the gondolier answered:,"Looking down upon him, the gondolier answered: ""You will pay.""","Looking straight past him, the gondolier answered, “You will pay.”","Staring into the distance above his head, the gondolier answered:"
"In dem Raum herrschte die feierliche Stille, die zum Ehrgeiz der großen Hotels gehört. Die bedienenden Kellner gingen auf leisen Sohlen umher. Ein Klappern des Teegerätes, ein halbgeflüstertes Wort war alles, was man vernahm. In einem Winkel, schräg gegenüber der Tür und zwei Tische von seinem entfernt, bemerkte Aschenbach die polnischen Mädchen mit ihrer Erzieherin. Sehr aufrecht, das aschblonde Haar neu geglättet und mit geröteten Augen, in steifen blauleinenen Kleidern mit kleinen weißen Fallkrägen und Manschetten saßen sie da und reichten einander ein Glas mit Eingemachtem. Sie waren mit ihrem Frühstück fast fertig. Der Knabe fehlte.","The room was filled with the solemn stillness that belongs to the ambitions of large hotels. The serving waiters walked about quietly. A clatter of the tea set, a word half whispered, was all that was heard. In a corner, diagonally across from the door and two tables away from his, Aschenbach noticed the Polish girls with their governess. They sat very erect, their ash-blonde hair newly straightened and their eyes reddened, in stiff blue linen dresses with little white collars and cuffs, and handed each other a jar of preserves. They were almost done with their breakfast. The boy was missing.","That formal silence reigned here which is the ambition of large hotels. The waiters who were serving walked about on soft soles. Nothing was audible but the tinkling of the tea-things, a word half-whispered. In one corner, obliquely across from the door, and two tables removed from his own, Aschenbach observed the Polish girls with their governess. Erect and red-eyed, their ash-blond hair freshly smoothed down, dressed in stiff blue linen with little white cuffs and turned-down collars—they were sitting there, handing around a glass of marmalade. They had almost finished their breakfast. The boy was missing.","The ceremonious silence on which grand hotels pride themselves prevailed. The waiters moved about the room noiselessly, on tiptoe. The clatter of tea things and a half-whispered word were the only sounds audible. In a corner diagonally opposite the door and two tables removed from his own, Aschenbach saw the Polish girls with their governess. Their ash-blond hair freshly plastered down, their eyes red, they sat perfectly erect in their stiff blue-linen dress with the small white turndown collars and cuffs, passing a jar of preserves round the table. The boy was absent.","The air there was dominated by the solemn quiet great hotels pride themselves on. The waiters tiptoed back and forth serving the guests, and nothing could be heard beyond a rattle of the teapot and a half-whispered word. In a corner, diagonally across from the door, two tables down from his own, Aschenbach spotted the Polish girls with their governess. Bolt upright, their ash blond hair freshly slicked back, they sat with bloodshot eyes in stiff blue linen frocks with tiny white turndown collars and cuffs and passed around a jar of preserves. They had almost finished their breakfast. The boy was nowhere to be seen."
"Schon am folgenden Tage, nachmittags, tat der Starrsinnige einen neuen Schritt zur Versuchung der Außenwelt und diesmal mit allem möglichen Erfolge. Er trat nämlich vom Markusplatz in das dort gelegene englische Reisebureau, und nachdem er an der Kasse einiges Geld gewechselt, richtete er mit der Miene des mißtrauischen Fremden an den ihn bedienenden Clerk seine fatale Frage. Es war ein wollig gekleideter Brite, noch jung, mit in der Mitte geteiltem Haar, nahe bei einander liegenden Augen und von jener gesetzten Loyalität des Wesens, die im spitzbübisch behenden Süden so fremd, so merkwürdig anmutet. Er fing an: »Kein Grund zur Besorgnis, Sir. Eine Maßregel ohne ernste Bedeutung. Solche Anordnungen werden häufig getroffen, um gesundheitsschädlichen Wirkungen der Hitze und des Scirocco vorzubeugen…« Aber seine blauen Augen aufschlagend, begegnete er dem Blicke des Fremden, einem müden und etwas traurigen Blick, der mit leichter Verachtung auf seine Lippen gerichtet war. Da errötete der Engländer. »Dies ist«, fuhr er halblaut und in einiger Bewegung fort, »die amtliche Erklärung, auf der zu bestehen man hier für gut befindet. Ich werde Ihnen sagen, daß noch etwas anderes dahinter steckt.« Und dann sagte er in seiner redlichen und bequemen Sprache die Wahrheit.","Already on the following day, in the afternoon, the stubborn man took a new step toward temptation from the outside world, and this time with every possible success. He went from St. Mark's Square to the English travel agency there, and after he had changed some money at the till, with the air of a suspicious stranger he addressed his fatal question to the clerk who served him. It was a woolly-clad Briton, still young, with hair parted in the middle, eyes set close together, and of that settled loyalty of nature which seems so foreign, so strange, in the mischievously nimble South. He began, 'No need to worry, sir. A measure of no serious importance. Such arrangements are often made to prevent the harmful effects of the heat and the sirocco...' But opening his blue eyes, he met the stranger's gaze, a weary and somewhat sad look fixed on his lips with a touch of contempt. Then the Englishman blushed. 'This is,' he went on in a low voice, with some movement, 'the official statement on which it is well decided here to insist. I'll tell you there's something else behind it.' And then, in his honest and comfortable language, he told the truth.","As early as the following day, in the afternoon, he had made new progress in his obstinate baiting of the people he met—and this time he had all possible success. He walked from the Piazza of St. Mark's into the English travelling bureau located there; and after changing some money at the cash desk, he put on the expression of a distrustful foreigner and launched his fatal question at the attendant clerk. He was a Britisher; he wore a woollen suit, and was still young, with close-set eyes, and had that characteristic stolid reliability which is so peculiarly and strikingly appealing in the tricky, nimble-witted South. He began, ""No reason for alarm, sir. A regulation without any serious significance. Such measures are often taken to anticipate the unhealthy effects of the heat and the sirocco . . . "" But as he raised his blue eyes, he met the stare of the foreigner, a tired and somewhat unhappy stare focussed on his lips with a touch of scorn. Then the Englishman blushed. ""At least,"" he continued in an emotional undertone, ""that is the official explanation which people here are content to accept. I will admit that there is something more behind it."" And then in his frank and leisurely manner he told the truth.","In the afternoon of the very next day the ever obstinate traveler took another step in his investigation of the outside world, and this time with the utmost success: he went into the British travel agency located just off Saint Mark’s Square and, after changing some money at the cash desk, assumed the expression of a suspicious foreigner and asked his awkward question of the clerk who had waited on him. The clerk was an Englishman in a tweed suit, still young, with hair parted down the middle, close-set eyes, and that sober trustworthiness so alien to and unusual in the spry and roguish South. “No cause for alarm, sir,” he began. “A routine measure, nothing serious. They often issue such orders to forestall the deleterious effects of the heat and the sirocco…” But when his blue eyes met the stranger’s weary, somewhat mournful gaze directed at his lips with mild contempt, the Englishman blushed. “That,” he went on in a low voice and with a certain animation, “is the official explanation, which one finds it expedient to accept here. But I can tell you that there is more to it than meets the eye.” And then in his honest, genial way he told Aschenbach the truth.","The very next day, during the afternoon, the stubborn Aschenbach made another attempt at provoking the world at large, this time with complete success. Specifically, he paid a visit to the English travel agency located on the Piazza San Marco, where, after changing money at the counter, he assumed the expression of a mistrustful foreigner, posing his fateful question to the clerk who had waited on him. It was a cardigan-wearing Englishman, still young, with middle-parted hair and closely set eyes, who was surrounded by that air of solid fidelity that seems so alien and misplaced amidst the mischievous cleverness of the Mediterranean. “Nothing to be concerned about, sir,” he began. “Official policy, nothing serious. Such measures are often taken to prevent unhealthy effects from the heat and the sirocco . . .” But when he raised his blue eyes, he was met by a stare from the foreign tourist, a tired and rather sad stare with a trace of contempt, which was directed at his own lips. At this the Englishman blushed. “At least,” he said in a whisper, visibly agitated, “that’s the official explanation people here see fit to stick by. I can tell you, though, that there’s more to it than that.” And then, in his frank and easy language, he revealed the truth."
"Verstimmung befiel ihn. Schon in diesem Augenblick dachte er an Abreise. Einmal, vor Jahren, hatte nach zwei heiteren Frühlingswochen hier dies Wetter ihn heimgesucht und sein Befinden so schwer geschädigt, daß er Venedig wie ein Fliehender hatte verlassen müssen. Stellte nicht schon wieder die fiebrige Unlust von damals, der Druck in den Schläfen, die Schwere der Augenlider sich ein? Noch einmal den Aufenthalt zu wechseln würde lästig sein; wenn aber der Wind nicht umschlug, so war seines Bleibens hier nicht. Er packte zur Sicherheit nicht völlig aus. Um neun Uhr frühstückte er in dem hierfür vorbehaltenen Büfettzimmer zwischen Halle und Speisesaal.","Annoyance seized him. At that moment he was already thinking of leaving. Once, years ago, after two clear spring weeks here, this weather had come upon him and damaged his health so badly that he had had to leave Venice like a fugitive. Wasn't that feverish listlessness from back then, the pressure in your temples, the heaviness of your eyelids, returning? Changing residence again would be a nuisance; but if the wind didn't change, he wasn't going to stay here. To be on the safe side, he didn't fully unpack. At nine o'clock he breakfasted in the buffet room reserved for this purpose between the hall and the dining room.","He felt depressed. He thought already of leaving. Once, years ago, after several weeks of spring here, this same weather had afflicted him, and impaired his health so seriously that he had to abandon Venice like a fugitive. Was not this old feverish unrest again setting in, the pressure in the temples, the heaviness of the eyelids? It would be annoying to change his residence still another time; but if the wind did not turn, he could not stay here. To be safe, he did not unpack completely. He breakfasted at nine in the buffet-room provided for this purpose between the lobby and the dining-room.","A sudden despondency came over him. He considered leaving then and there. Once, years before, after weeks of a beautiful spring, he had been visited by this sort of weather and it so affected his health he had been obliged to flee. Was not the same listless fever setting in? The pressure in the temples, the heavy eyelids? Changing hotels again would be a nuisance, but if the wind failed to shift he could not possibly remain here. To be on the safe side, he did not unpack everything. At nine he went to breakfast in the specially designated buffet between the lobby and the dining room.","His mood was bleak. He was already thinking about leaving. Once, years ago, following several bright weeks of springtime, he had been subjected to this sort of weather, with such adverse effects on his health that he had had to flee Venice like a refugee. Was this not the same listless fever, the same pressure behind the temples, the same heaviness in the eyelids? Changing locale again would be a bother, but if the wind didn’t shift, his stay was up. To play it safe, he didn’t unpack completely. At nine o’clock he ate breakfast in the buffet room between the parlor and the main dining area."
"Ermüdet, betäubt von dem Wirbel dieses seltsamen Vormittags, ließ er sich, nachdem er den Inhalt seiner Handtasche im Zimmer verteilt, in einem Lehnstuhl am offenen Fenster nieder. Das Meer hatte eine blaßgrüne Färbung angenommen, die Luft schien dünner und reiner, der Strand mit seinen Hütten und Booten farbiger, obgleich der Himmel noch grau war. Aschenbach blickte hinaus, die Hände im Schoß gefaltet, zufrieden, wieder hier zu sein, kopfschüttelnd unzufrieden über seinen Wankelmut, seine Unkenntnis der eigenen Wünsche. So saß er wohl eine Stunde, ruhend und gedankenlos träumend. Um Mittag erblickte er Tadzio, der in gestreiftem Leinenanzug mit roter Masche, vom Meere her, durch die Strandsperre und die Bretterwege entlang zum Hotel zurückkehrte. Aschenbach erkannte ihn aus seiner Höhe sofort, bevor er ihn eigentlich ins Auge gefaßt, und wollte etwas denken, wie: »Sieh, Tadzio, da bist ja auch du wieder!« Aber im gleichen Augenblick fühlte er, wie der lässige Gruß vor der Wahrheit seines Herzens hinsank und verstummte,—fühlte die Begeisterung seines Blutes, die Freude, den Schmerz seiner Seele und erkannte, daß ihm um Tadzios willen der Abschied so schwer geworden war.","Tired, stunned by the excitement of this strange morning, after scattering the contents of his handbag around the room, he sat down in an armchair by the open window. The sea had taken on a pale green hue, the air seemed thinner and cleaner, the beach with its huts and boats more colorful, although the sky was still gray. Aschenbach looked out, hands folded in his lap, happy to be back, shaking his head, dissatisfied with his fickleness and ignorance of his own desires. He sat like that for an hour, resting and dreaming thoughtlessly. At noon he saw Tadzio, in a striped linen suit with a red bow tie, returning from the sea through the beach barrier and along the boardwalk to the hotel. Aschenbach recognized him from his height, before he had actually set his eyes on him, and wanted to think something like: ""Look, Tadzio, there you are again!"" But at the same moment he felt like the casual greeting before the truth his heart sank and fell silent—felt the enthusiasm in his blood, the joy, the pain in his soul and recognized that for Tadzio's sake it had become so difficult for him to say goodbye.","Tired out by the confusion of this strange forenoon, he distributed the contents of his hand-bag about the room and dropped into an arm-chair by the open window. The sea had become a pale green, the air seemed thinner and purer; the beach, with its cabins and boats, seemed to have colour, although the sky was still grey. Aschenbach looked out, his hands folded in his lap; he was content to be back, but shook his head disapprovingly at his irresolution, his failure to know his own mind. He sat here for the better part of an hour, resting and dreaming vaguely. About noon he saw Tadzio in a striped linen suit with a red tie, coming back from the sea across the private beach and along the boardwalk to the hotel. Aschenbach recognized him from this altitude before he had actually set eyes on him; he was about to think some such words as ""Well, Tadzio, there you are again!"" but at the same moment he felt this careless greeting go dumb before the truth in his heart. He felt the exhilaration of his blood, a conflict of pain and pleasure, and he realized that it was Tadzio who had made it so difficult for him to leave.","Exhausted and benumbed by the strange morning’s turmoil, he distributed the contents of his bag about the room and settled into a reclining chair at the open window. The sea had turned a pale green, the air seemed thinner and purer, the beach with its boats and cabanas more colorful, though the sky was still gray. Aschenbach gazed out of the window, his hands folded in his lap, pleased to be back, but shaking his head in displeasure at his fickle nature, his ignorance of his own wishes. He sat thus for perhaps an hour in repose and idle reverie. At noon he spotted Tadzio in his striped linen outfit and red bow returning from the sea to the hotel through the beach gate and along the boardwalks. From his lofty vantage point Aschenbach recognized him immediately, even before getting a clear view of him, and was on the point of thinking something like: So you’re still here, too, Tadzio. But at that very moment he felt the casual greeting fade and vanish before the truth of his heart, he felt the rapture of his blood, the joy and agony of his soul, and acknowledged to himself that it was Tadzio who had made it so hard for him to leave.","He distributed the contents of his hand luggage about the room and then sank, exhausted and numb from the whirlwind of activity on this extraordinary morning, into an easy chair near the window. The sea had taken on a pale green tint, the air seemed fresher and less thick, and the beach with its huts and boats looked more colorful, even though the sky was still gray. Aschenbach gazed out, his hands folded in his lap, content to be there once more, shaking his head at having been so fickle, at not having known what he really wanted. Thus he sat for at least an hour, resting and daydreaming, undisturbed by any real thoughts. Around noon he caught sight of Tadzio in the striped linen outfit with the red breast-knot, emerging from the sea, exiting the beach, then coming up the boardwalk back to the hotel. From his elevated vantage point, Aschenbach recognized him at once, before the boy had actually become fully visible, and was about to think something like: why, Tadzio, there you are again, too! But in that very instant he felt the flippant greeting die on his lips, sinking down before the truth in his heart. He felt the quickening of his blood, the joy and pain within his soul, and he realized that Tadzio was the reason it had been so difficult to leave."
"Aber der Tag, der so feurig-festlich begann, war im ganzen seltsam gehoben und mythisch verwandelt. Woher kam und stammte der Hauch, der auf einmal so sanft und bedeutend, höherer Einflüsterung gleich, Schläfe und Ohr umspielte? Weiße Federwölkchen standen in verbreiteten Scharen am Himmel, gleich weidenden Herden der Götter. Stärkerer Wind erhob sich, und die Rosse Poseidons liefen, sich bäumend, daher, Stiere auch wohl, dem Bläulichgelockten gehörig, welche mit Brüllen anrennend die Hörner senkten. Zwischen dem Felsengeröll des entfernteren Strandes jedoch hüpften die Wellen empor als springende Ziegen. Eine heilig entstellte Welt voll panischen Lebens schloß den Berückten ein, und sein Herz träumte zarte Fabeln. Mehrmals, wenn hinter Venedig die Sonne sank, saß er auf einer Bank im Park, um Tadzio zuzuschauen, der sich, weiß gekleidet und farbig gegürtet, auf dem gewalzten Kiesplatz mit Ballspiel vergnügte, und Hyakinthos war es, den er zu sehen glaubte, und der sterben mußte, weil zwei Götter ihn liebten. Ja, er empfand Zephyrs schmerzenden Neid auf den Nebenbuhler, der des Orakels, des Bogens und der Kithara vergaß, um immer mit dem Schönen zu spielen; er sah die Wurfscheibe, von grausamer Eifersucht gelenkt, das liebliche Haupt treffen, er empfing, erblassend auch er, den geknickten Leib, und die Blume, dem süßen Blute entsprossen, trug die Inschrift seiner unendlichen Klage…","But the day, which began so fiercely and festively, was on the whole strangely exalted and transformed into myth. Where did the breath come from that suddenly played so softly and significantly, like a higher suggestion, around temples and ears? White feather clouds stood in widespread flocks in the sky, like grazing herds of the gods. A stronger wind arose, and Poseidon's horses ran rearing, along with bulls, too, belonging to the blue-haired one, who lowered their horns, running at them with a roar. Between the rocky scree of the farther beach, however, the waves bobbed up like leaping goats. A holy, distorted world full of panic-stricken life enclosed the enraptured man, and his heart dreamed tender fables. Several times, when the sun was sinking behind Venice, he would sit on a bench in the park to watch Tadzio, dressed in white and wearing a colorful belt, playing ball on the paved gravel field, and it was Hyakinthos he thought he saw, and who had to die because two gods loved him. Yes, he felt Zephyr's painful envy of the rival who forgot the oracle, the bow, and the cithara, in order always to play with beauty; he saw the throwing disc, guided by cruel jealousy, hit the lovely head, he received, paling, he too, the bruised body, and the flower, sprouted from the sweet blood, bore the inscription of his endless lamentation...","But the day which began with such fiery solemnity underwent a strange mythical transformation. Where did the breeze originate which suddenly began playing so gently and insinuatingly, like some whispered suggestion, about his ears and temples? Little white choppy clouds stood in the sky in scattered clumps, like the pasturing herds of the gods. A stronger wind arose, and the steeds of Poseidon came prancing up, and along with them the steers which belonged to the blue-locked god, bellowing and lowering their horns as they ran. Yet among the detritus of the more distant beach waves were hopping forward like agile goats. He was caught in the enchantment of a sacredly distorted world full of Panic life—and he dreamed delicate legends. Often, when the sun was sinking behind Venice, he would sit on a bench in the park observing Tadzio who was dressed in a white suit with a coloured sash and was playing ball on the smooth gravel—and it was Hyacinth that he seemed to be watching. Hyacinth who was to die because two gods loved him. Yes, he felt Zephyr's aching jealousy of the rival who forgot the oracle, the bow, and the lyre, in order to play for ever with this beauty. He saw the discus, guided by a pitiless envy, strike the lovely head; he too, growing pale, caught the drooping body—and the flower, sprung from this sweet blood, bore the inscription of his unending grief.","Not only did the day begin with fiery festivities, however; it remained curiously feverish, metamorphosed by myth. Whence did it come, what was its source, the sudden breath of air that played so gently and tellingly about his temples and ears like an afflatus from on high? Clouds fleecy white dotted the sky like the gods’ own flocks out to pasture. A stiffer wind came up, and Poseidon’s steeds reared and shot forward; his bulls, too, the bulls of the blue-curled god, bellowed and charged, their horns lowered. Waves gamboled high like frisky goats amidst the rocks on the beach farther off. A world sacredly deformed and imbued with the spirit of Pan surrounded the spellbound observer, and his heart dreamed soothing fables. At times, as the sun sank behind Venice, he would sit on a bench in the park watching Tadzio, clad in white and with a bright-colored sash, play ball on the rolled gravel court, but seeing Hyacinth who, loved by two gods, was doomed to death. He could fairly feel Zephyr’s painful envy of his rival, who neglected his oracle, bow, and zither the better to sport with the beautiful youth; he could see the discus, flung out of cruel jealousy, striking the exquisite head; he, too, turned pale as he caught the buckled body, and the flower which sprang from that sweet blood bore the imprint of his undying plaint…","But the day that began with such fiery ceremony continued on strangely exalted, mythically transformed. Where did that breeze come from, which played, all at once, like a higher intimation, so gently yet so significantly around his temples and ears? Bands of feathery white clouds stood scattered across the sky like the grazing herds of the gods. The wind increased, and the steeds of Poseidon reared up and ran, bulls, no doubt, too, also property of the blue-haired god, which lowered their horns and bellowed as they charged. On the other hand, among the scree of the more distant beach, the waves sprang in the air like mountain goats. A world full of Panically driven life enveloped the captivated Aschenbach, and his heart dreamt tender fables. More than once, as the sun set behind Venice, he sat on a bench in the hotel park and watched as Tadzio played happily with a ball on the rolled gravel courtyard in a white outfit with a colorful belt. He could have sworn he was watching Hyacinth, who was fated to die young because a pair of gods loved him. He could literally feel Zephyr’s agonized jealousy at how his competitor neglected oracle, bow and zither in order to play endlessly with the beautiful boy. He could see the discus, directed by terrible envy, strike the boy’s adorable head. Turning pale himself, he caught the twisted body, and the flower that bloomed from the boy’s sweet blood was inscribed with his never-ending lament."
"Eine Art Zartgefühl oder Erschrockenheit, etwas wie Achtung und Scham, veranlaßte Aschenbach, sich abzuwenden, als ob er nichts gesehen hätte; denn dem ernsten Zufallsbeobachter der Leidenschaft widerstrebt es, von seinen Wahrnehmungen auch nur vor sich selber Gebrauch zu machen. Er war aber erheitert und erschüttert zugleich, das heißt: beglückt. Dieser kindische Fanatismus, gerichtet gegen das gutmütigste Stück Leben,—er stellte das Göttlich-Nichtssagende in menschliche Beziehungen; er ließ ein kostbares Bildwerk der Natur, das nur zur Augenweide getaugt hatte, einer tieferen Teilnahme wert erscheinen; und er verlieh der ohnehin durch Schönheit bedeutenden Gestalt des Halbwüchsigen eine politisch-geschichtliche Folie, die gestattete, ihn über seine Jahre ernst zu nehmen.","A kind of tenderness or shock, something like respect and shame, caused Aschenbach to turn away as if he hadn't seen anything; for the serious casual observer of passion is reluctant to make use of his perceptions, even to himself. But he was amused and shaken at the same time, that is: delighted. This childish fanaticism, directed against the most good-natured piece of life—it placed the divinely meaningless in human relations; he made a precious sculpture of nature, which was only good for the eyes, seem worthy of a deeper sympathy; and he gave the figure of the adolescent, who was already significant because of his beauty, a political and historical background that allowed him to be taken seriously over his years.","A kind of pudency or confusion, something like respect and shyness, caused Aschenbach to turn away as though he had seen nothing. For the earnest-minded who have been casual observers of some passion, struggle against making use, even to themselves, of what they have seen. But he was both cheered and unstrung—which is to say, he was happy. This childish fanaticism, directed against the most good-natured possible aspect of life—it brought the divinely arbitrary into human relationships; it made a delightful natural picture which had appealed only to the eye now seem worthy of a deeper sympathy; and it gave the figure of this half-grown boy, who had already been important enough by his sheer beauty, something to offset him still further, and to make one take him more seriously than his years justified.","A kind of delicacy or apprehension, something akin to deference or modesty, caused Aschenbach to turn away, as if he had seen nothing. Any serious individual who chances to observe a moment of passion is loath to make personal use of what he has witnessed. Yet he was cheered and shaken at the same time, in other words, elated. This childish fanaticism aimed at so benign a target gave the boy’s mute divinity a human perspective: it made an exquisite work of nature—a statue, a mere feast for the eyes—something worthy of deeper consideration and placed the figure of an adolescent, already remarkable for his beauty, against a background enabling one to take him seriously beyond his years.","A sudden pang of delicacy or scandalization, something between respect and shame, caused Aschenbach to turn away as though he had seen nothing, for it goes against the grain of any mature person to exploit, even for private consumption, an accidentally observed moment of passion. Nevertheless, Aschenbach was simultaneously heartened and surprised, that is to say, delighted. This childish extremism, which had been directed against such a good-natured embodiment of life, humanized the boy’s divine impenetrability. It made an exquisite natural sculpture, which until now had been merely a feast for the eyes, suddenly seem worthy of a deeper interest. It gave this half-grown adolescent, already remarkable for his beauty, an external layer that allowed him to be taken more seriously than his years."
"Er kam durch die Glastür und ging in der Stille schräg durch den Raum zum Tisch seiner Schwestern. Sein Gehen war sowohl in der Haltung des Oberkörpers wie in der Bewegung der Kniee, dem Aufsetzen des weißbeschuhten Fußes von außerordentlicher Anmut, sehr leicht, zugleich zart und stolz und verschönt noch durch die kindliche Verschämtheit, in welcher er zweimal unterwegs, mit einer Kopfwendung in den Saal, die Augen aufschlug und senkte. Lächelnd, mit einem halblauten Wort in seiner weich verschwommenen Sprache nahm er seinen Platz ein, und jetzt zumal, da er dem Schauenden sein genaues Profil zuwandte, erstaunte dieser aufs neue, ja erschrak über die wahrhaft gottähnliche Schönheit des Menschenkindes. Der Knabe trug heute einen leichten Blusenanzug aus blau und weiß gestreiftem Waschstoff mit rotseidener Masche auf der Brust und am Halse von einem einfachen weißen Stehkragen abgeschlossen. Auf diesem Kragen aber, der nicht einmal sonderlich elegant zum Charakter des Anzugs passen wollte, ruhte die Blüte des Hauptes in unvergleichlichem Liebreiz,—das Haupt des Eros, vom gelblichen Schmelze parischen Marmors, mit feinen und ernsten Brauen, Schläfen und Ohr vom rechtwinklig einspringenden Geringel des Haares dunkel und weich bedeckt.","He came through the glass door and in the silence walked diagonally across the room to his sisters' table. His walking was exceptionally graceful, both in the posture of his upper body and in the movement of his knees, the placing of his white-shod foot, very light, at the same time delicate and proud and embellished by the childish bashfulness in which he walked twice, turning his head to the hall, eyes opened and lowered. Smiling, with a half-spoken word in his soft, slurred speech, he took his seat, and now that he turned his exact profile towards the viewer, the latter was again astonished, even frightened, at the truly godlike beauty of the human child. Today the boy was wearing a light blouse suit made of blue and white striped linen with a red silk bow tie on the chest and a simple white stand-up collar at the neck. On this collar, however, which did not even want to go particularly elegantly with the character of the suit, the flower of the head rested in incomparable charm—the head of Eros, made of yellowish melted Parian marble, with fine and serious brows, temples and ears of the one that protruded at right angles Ringlets of hair dark and softly covered.","He came through the glass door and crossed the room in silence to his sisters' table. His approach—the way he held the upper part of his body, and bent his knees, the movement of his white-shod feet—had an extraordinary charm; he walked very lightly, at once timid and proud, and this became still more lovely through the childish embarrassment with which, twice as he proceeded, he turned his face towards the centre of the room, raising and lowering his eyes. Smiling, with something half-muttered in his soft vague tongue, he took his place; and now, as he turned his full profile to the observer, Aschenbach was again astonished, terrified even, by the really godlike beauty of this human child. To-day the boy was wearing a light blouse of blue and white striped cotton goods, with a red silk tie in front, and closed at the neck by a plain white high collar. This collar lacked the distinctiveness of the blouse, but above it the flowering head was poised with an incomparable seductiveness—the head of an Eros, in blended yellows of Parian marble, with fine serious brows, the temples and ears covered softly by the abrupt encroachment of his curls.","He came through the glass door and walked straight across the quiet room to his sisters’ table. His gait was extraordinarily graceful both in the way he held his upper torso and in the way he moved his knees and white-shod feet; it was a very light gait, at once delicate and proud, and embellished by the childlike modesty with which, twice on his way across the room, he turned his head and raised, then lowered his eyes. Smiling and murmuring a word in his soft, fuzzy language, he took his seat, and now, especially as he had turned his full profile to the observer, the latter was once more amazed, indeed, startled by the truly godlike beauty of this mortal being. Today the boy was wearing a lightweight, washable outfit with a blue-and-white-striped middy blouse that had a red silk bow at the chest and a plain white stand-up collar. The collar, though none too elegant a match for the rest of the outfit, showed off the boy’s fair, blossoming head in its consummate charm, the head of an Eros with the creamy glaze of Parian marble, eyebrows serious and finely traced, temples and ear covered darkly and softly at right angles by encroaching ringlets.","The boy entered through the glass door and passed silently across the room to his sisters’ table. In everything from the carriage of his upper body to the bend in his knees to the tread of his feet in their white shoes, his walk was extraordinarily graceful. It was quite light, delicate yet proud, and was made more beautiful still by the childlike modesty with which he twice batted his eyes and turned his head toward the dining room as he went along. Smiling, murmuring something half-audible in his softly liquid native tongue, he took his seat. At that moment the boy’s full profile was facing in his direction, and the observing Aschenbach again marveled, indeed shuddered, at the truly godlike beauty of this mortal child. Today the boy was wearing a thin blue-and-white stitched-blend uniform with a red silk breast-knot finishing at the neck in a simple white standing collar. Though this collar did not set off the rest of the outfit with particular elegance, his head floated atop it with incomparably charming beauty, like a flower in bloom. It was the head of Eros, its skin the lustrous yellow of Parian marble, its eyebrows well defined and earnest, both temples and one ear gently silhouetted by a perpendicular ringlet of hair."
Frau eines hohen deutschen Beamten sein können. Etwas von,can be the wife of a high German official. Something of,"She might have been the wife of some high German official. Except that her jewellery added something fantastically lavish to her appearance; indeed, it was almost priceless, and consisted of ear pendants and a very long triple chain of softly glowing pearls, as large as cherries.","She could have been the wife of a high-ranking German official. The only aspect of her appearance evincing a certain fanciful sense of luxury was the jewelry, which was in fact nearly worthless and consisted of earrings plus a very long triple strand of gently shimmering pearls the size of cherries.","In Germany she could have been the wife of an important governmental officer. The only element of the extraordinary or the luxurious in her appearance was her jewelry, a pair of dangling earrings and three very long strands of gently shimmering pearls, as big as cherries, all of which were literally priceless."
"Gustav von Aschenbach war ein wenig unter Mittelgröße, brünett, rasiert. Sein Kopf erschien ein wenig zu groß im Verhältnis zu der fast zierlichen Gestalt. Sein rückwärts gebürstetes Haar, am Scheitel gelichtet, an den Schläfen sehr voll und stark ergraut, umrahmte eine hohe, zerklüftete und gleichsam narbige Stirn. Der Bügel einer Goldbrille mit randlosen Gläsern schnitt in die Wurzel der gedrungenen, edel gebogenen Nase ein. Der Mund war groß, oft schlaff, oft plötzlich schmal und gespannt; die Wangenpartie mager und gefurcht, das wohlausgebildete Kinn weich gespalten. Bedeutende Schicksale schienen über dies meist leidend seitwärts geneigte Haupt hinweggegangen zu sein, und doch war die Kunst es gewesen, die hier jene physiognomische Durchbildung übernommen hatte, welche sonst das Werk eines schweren, bewegten Lebens ist. Hinter dieser Stirn waren die blitzenden Repliken des Gesprächs zwischen Voltaire und dem Könige über den Krieg geboren; diese Augen, müde und tief durch die Gläser blickend, hatten das blutige Inferno der Lazarette des Siebenjährigen Krieges gesehen. Auch persönlich genommen ist ja die Kunst ein erhöhtes Leben. Sie beglückt tiefer, sie verzehrt rascher. Sie gräbt in das Antlitz ihres Dieners die Spuren imaginärer und geistiger Abenteuer, und sie erzeugt, selbst bei klösterlicher Stille des äußeren Daseins, auf die Dauer eine Verwöhntheit, Überfeinerung, Müdigkeit und Neugier der Nerven, wie ein Leben voll ausschweifendster Leidenschaften und Genüsse sie kaum hervorzubringen vermag.","Gustav von Aschenbach was a little under medium height, brunette, shaved. His head seemed a little too big in relation to the almost petite figure. His hair, which was brushed backwards and thinned at the crown, very full and very gray at the temples, framed a high, jagged and almost scarred forehead. The arm of a pair of rimless gold glasses cut into the root of the squat, nobly curved nose. The mouth was large, often slack, often suddenly narrow and tense; the cheeks lean and furrowed, the well-formed chin softly cleft. Significant fates seemed to have passed over this head, which was usually bent sideways in suffering, and yet it was art that had taken over that physiognomic development that is otherwise the work of a difficult, eventful life. Behind this forehead were born the sparkling replicas of the conversation between Voltaire and the king about the war; those eyes, tired and looking deeply through the glasses, had seen the bloody inferno of the hospitals of the Seven Years' War. Taken personally, too, art is an elevated life. It delights deeper, it consumes faster. She digs into the face of her servant the traces of imaginary and spiritual adventures, and even in the monastic silence of outer existence she produces in the long run a drowsiness, over-refining, weariness and curiosity of the nerves, such as a life full of the most extravagant passions and pleasures able to produce.","Gustav von Aschenbach was somewhat below average height, dark, and smooth-shaven. His head seemed a bit too large in comparison with his almost dapper figure. His hair was brushed straight back, thinning out towards the crown, but very full about the temples, and strongly marked with grey; it framed a high, ridged forehead. Gold spectacles with rimless lenses cut into the bridge of his bold, heavy nose. The mouth was big, sometimes drooping, sometimes suddenly pinched and firm. His cheeks were thin and wrinkled, his well-formed chin had a slight cleft. This head, usually bent patiently to one side, seemed to have gone through momentous experiences, and yet it was his art which had produced those effects in his face, effects which are elsewhere the result of hard and agitated living. Behind this brow the brilliant repartee of the dialogue on war between Voltaire and the king had been born; these eyes, peering steadily and wearily from behind their glasses, had seen the bloody inferno of the lazaret in the Seven Years' War. Even as it applies to the individual, art is a heightened mode of existence. It gives deeper pleasures, it consumes more quickly. It carves into its servants' faces the marks of imaginary and spiritual adventures, and though their external activities may be as quiet as a cloister, it produces a lasting voluptuousness, over-refinement, fatigue, and curiosity of the nerves such as can barely result from a life filled with illicit passions and enjoyments.","Gustav von Aschenbach was of somewhat less than medium height, dark, and clean-shaven. The head seemed a bit too large for the almost dainty physique. The hair, brushed back, was thin at the crown but very thick and gray at the temples and framed a high, rugged, scarred-looking forehead. The gold frame of the rimless spectacles cut into the root of a strong, nobly aquiline nose. The mouth was large—now slack, now suddenly narrow and tight—the cheeks sunken and furrowed, the well-shaped chin slightly cleft. Important destinies must have passed through that head, which was often tilted dolefully, yet it was art—not, as is commonly the case, a hard and turbulent life—that had formed the physiognomy. The dazzling give and take of the interchange between Voltaire and the king on the subject of war had been conceived behind that brow; those eyes, wearily peering out through their lenses, had seen the gory inferno of the sick bays in the Seven Years War. On a personal level, too, art is life intensified: it delights more deeply, consumes more rapidly; it engraves the traces of imaginary and intellectual adventure on the countenance of its servant and in the long run, for all the monastic calm of his external existence, leads to self-indulgence, overrefinement, lethargy, and a restless curiosity that a lifetime of wild passions and pleasures could scarcely engender.","Gustav von Aschenbach was slightly below average height, clean-shaven and brunet. His head looked a bit too large for the almost delicate figure he cut. His brushed-back hair, thinning on top, quite thick and heavily gray at the temples, framed a high, lined, perhaps even scarred forehead. The bow from a pair of rimless gold glasses dug into the base of his stout Roman nose. He had a wide mouth equally wont to droop and suddenly tense up and purse, a set of cheeks gaunt and furrowed, and a clearly defined chin with a delicate cleft. Great moments of destiny seemed to have passed over this head, which he usually held at somewhat of an angle, as though in pain. It had been art, though, that had taken over the work, otherwise associated with a difficult and stormy life, of wringing these physiological changes. Behind these brows had been born the lightninglike exchanges between Voltaire and the king as they debated war; these eyes, gazing with such weary depth through those glass lenses, had seen the bloody inferno of the lazaretti during the Seven Years’ War. Art—understood as personal experience, too—is life raised to a higher power. It gives a deeper pleasure and exacts a quicker toll. It etches the real traces of the imaginative mind’s adventures onto the face of its servant and produces, though that servant may lead an external existence of monastic calm, nerves that in the long run are overindulged, hypersensitive, exhausted and perennially craving, such as a lifetime of dissipate passions and pleasures can hardly equal."
"Brauen schob sie ihren Stuhl zurück und verneigte sich, als eine große",Brows she pushed her chair back and bowed as a big one,"With lifted brows, she pushed back her chair and bowed, as a large woman dressed in grey and richly jewelled with pearls entered the lobby.","Arching her brows, she pushed her chair back and bowed when a tall woman dressed in grayish white and richly adorned with pearls entered the lobby.","Brows arched, she pushed her chair back and bowed as a tall woman wearing a light gray evening gown and a rich set of pearls entered the parlor."
Aschenbach lächelte. Nun kleiner Phäake! dachte er. Du scheinst vor diesen das Vorrecht beliebigen Ausschlafens zu genießen. Und plötzlich aufgeheitert rezitierte er bei sich selbst den Vers:,"Aschenbach smiled. Well, little Phaeace! he thought. You seem to enjoy the privilege of sleeping in before them. And suddenly cheered up, he recited the verse to himself:","Aschenbach smiled. "" Well, little Phaeacian!"" he thought. ""You seem to be enjoying the pleasant privilege of having your sleep out."" And suddenly exhilarated, he recited to himself the line: ""A frequent change of dress; warm baths, and rest.""","Aschenbach smiled. Well, well, little Phaeacian! he thought. You seem to be the only one privileged to sleep his fill. And brightening suddenly, he recited the following line to himself:","Aschenbach smiled. So, my little Phaeacian. It seems you alone enjoy the privilege of sleeping in. And cheering up suddenly, he recited to himself the line: “. . ."
"Es stand fest, was hierauf zurückzugeben war. Aschenbach sagte mechanisch:",It was clear what was to be returned. Aschenbach said mechanically:,"It was plain how this should be answered. Aschenbach said mechanically: ""I shall pay nothing, absolutely nothing, if you don't take me where I want to go.""","The response called for was clear. “I shall not pay a thing,” Aschenbach answered mechanically, “not a thing if you take me where I do not want to go.”",His response was prescribed. Aschenbach said mechanically:
"Wie still und stiller es um ihn wurde! Nichts war zu vernehmen als das Plätschern des Ruders, das hohle Aufschlagen der Wellen gegen den Schnabel der Barke, der steil, schwarz und an der Spitze hellebardenartig bewehrt über dem Wasser stand und noch ein Drittes, ein Reden, ein Raunen,—das Flüstern des Gondoliers, der zwischen den Zähnen, stoßweise, in Lauten, die von der Arbeit seiner Arme gepreßt waren, zu sich selber sprach. Aschenbach blickte auf, und mit leichter Befremdung gewahrte er, daß um ihn her die Lagune sich weitete und seine Fahrt dem offenen Meere zugekehrt war. Es schien folglich, daß er nicht allzu sehr ruhen dürfe, sondern auf den Vollzug seines Willens ein wenig bedacht sein müsse.","How still and still it became around him! Nothing could be heard but the splashing of the rudder, the hollow pounding of the waves against the beak of the barge, which stood steeply, black and armed like halberds at the tip above the water, and a third thing, a talking, a murmuring—the whispering of the gondolier, speaking to himself between his teeth, in fits and starts, in sounds strained by the labor of his arms. Aschenbach looked up, and with a little dismay he saw that the lagoon was widening around him and his voyage was facing the open sea. It seemed consequently that he must not rest too much, but must be a little thoughtful about carrying out his will.","It became quieter and quieter around him! There was nothing to be heard but the splashing of the oar, the hollow slapping of the waves against the prow of the boat as it stood above the water black and bold and armed with its halberd-like tip, and a third sound, of speaking, of whispering—the whispering of the gondolier, who was talking to himself between his teeth, fitfully, in words that were pressed out by the exertion of his arms. Aschenbach looked up, and was slightly astonished to discover that the lagoon was widening, and he was headed for the open sea. This seemed to indicate that he ought not to rest too much, but should see to it that his wishes were carried out.","How calm and yet calmer his surroundings became! There was nothing to be heard but the plash of the oar and the hollow thump of the waves against the prow, which rose up over the water, steep and black and reinforced at the tip like a halberd, and yet a third sound, a mutter, a murmur, the whisper of the gondolier talking to himself through clenched teeth, in fits and starts, the sounds extracted by the effort of his arms. Aschenbach glanced up and noted not without consternation that the lagoon was widening about him and the gondola making for the open sea. Clearly he could not relax all that much; he would have to see to the execution of his wishes.","How quiet it was growing around him! Nothing could be heard except the soft splash of the oar, the dull slap of the waves against the prow—which stuck up from the water, stiff, black and spiked like a halberd—and a third sound as well, a murmuring, a muttering: the hissing of the gondolier through his teeth. He was talking to himself in spasmodic phrases muted by his laboring arms. Aschenbach opened his eyes and was rather startled to find the Lagoon growing wider and the boat heading out toward the open sea. It seemed he couldn’t relax too much; some attention was required to ensure that his requests were indeed carried out."
"Halle betrat. Die Haltung dieser Frau war kühl und gemessen, die",entered the hall. This woman's attitude was cool and measured,"With lifted brows, she pushed back her chair and bowed, as a large woman dressed in grey and richly jewelled with pearls entered the lobby. This woman was advancing with coolness and precision; her lightly powdered hair and the lines of her dress were arranged with the simplicity which always signifies taste in those quarters where devoutness is taken as one element of dignity.","Arching her brows, she pushed her chair back and bowed when a tall woman dressed in grayish white and richly adorned with pearls entered the lobby. The woman’s demeanor was cool and dignified; the look of her lightly powdered coiffure and the cut of her dress displayed the simplicity that prescribes taste wherever piety is deemed an attribute of aristocracy.","Brows arched, she pushed her chair back and bowed as a tall woman wearing a light gray evening gown and a rich set of pearls entered the parlor. The woman’s manner was cool and measured, her lightly powdered hair arranged and her gown designed with that simplicity of fashion to be found wherever piety represents an essential component of nobility."
"Ins Hotel zurückgekehrt, begab er sich sogleich in die Halle zum Zeitungstisch und hielt in den Blättern Umschau. Er fand in den fremdsprachigen nichts. Die heimatlichen verzeichneten Gerüchte, führten schwankende Ziffern an, gaben amtliche Ableugnungen wieder und bezweifelten deren Wahrhaftigkeit. So erklärte sich der Abzug des deutschen und österreichischen Elementes. Die Angehörigen der übrigen Nationen wußten offenbar nichts, ahnten nichts, waren noch nicht beunruhigt. »Man soll schweigen!« dachte Aschenbach erregt, indem er die Journale auf den Tisch zurückwarf. »Man soll das verschweigen!« Aber zugleich füllte sein Herz sich mit Genugtuung über das Abenteuer, in welches die Außenwelt geraten wollte. Denn der Leidenschaft ist, wie dem Verbrechen, die gesicherte Ordnung und Wohlfahrt des Alltags nicht gemäß, und jede Lockerung des bürgerlichen Gefüges, jede Verwirrung und Heimsuchung der Welt muß ihr willkommen sein, weil sie ihren Vorteil dabei zu finden unbestimmt hoffen kann. So empfand Aschenbach eine dunkle Zufriedenheit über die obrigkeitlich bemäntelten Vorgänge in den schmutzigen Gäßchen Venedigs,—dieses schlimme Geheimnis der Stadt, das mit seinem eigensten Geheimnis verschmolz, und an dessen Bewahrung auch ihm so sehr gelegen war. Denn der Verliebte besorgte nichts, als daß Tadzio abreisen könnte und erkannte nicht ohne Entsetzen, daß er nicht mehr zu leben wissen werde, wenn das geschähe.","When he got back to the hotel, he immediately went to the newspaper table in the hall and looked around at the papers. He found nothing in the foreign language. The rumors recorded at home quoted fluctuating numbers, reproduced official denials and doubted their truthfulness. This explains the withdrawal of the German and Austrian elements. The members of the other nations evidently knew nothing, suspected nothing, were not yet alarmed. ""One should be silent!"" thought Aschenbach excitedly, throwing the journals back on the table. ""One should keep quiet about it!"" But at the same time his heart was filled with satisfaction at the adventure the outside world was about to embark on. For passion, like crime, is not in keeping with the secure order and well-being of everyday life, and every loosening of the bourgeois structure, every confusion and affliction of the world must be welcome to it, because it can vaguely hope to find an advantage in it. So Aschenbach felt a dark contentment about what was happening in the filthy little streets of Venice in the cloak of authority—this terrible secret of the city, which merged with his own secret, and which he too was so keen to preserve. For the lover worried only that Tadzio could leave, and realized, not without horror, that if that happened he would no longer be able to live.","Returning to the hotel, he went immediately to the periodical stand in the lobby and ran through the papers. He found nothing in the foreign language press. The domestic press spoke of rumours, produced hazy statistics, repeated official denials and questioned their truthfulness. This explained the departure of the German and Austrian guests. Obviously, the subjects of the other nations knew nothing, suspected nothing, were not yet uneasy. "" To keep it quiet!"" Aschenbach thought angrily, as he threw the papers back on the table. "" To keep that quiet!"" But at the same moment he was filled with satisfaction over the adventure that was to befall the world about him. For passion, like crime, is not suited to the secure daily rounds of order and well-being; and every slackening in the bourgeois structure, every disorder and affliction of the world, must be held welcome, since they bring with them a vague promise of advantage. So Aschenbach felt a dark contentment with what was taking place, under cover of the authorities, in the dirty alleys of Venice. This wicked secret of the city was welded with his own secret, and he too was involved in keeping it hidden. For in his infatuation he cared about nothing but the possibility of Tadzio's leaving, and he realized with something like terror that he would not know how to go on living if this occurred.","Back at the hotel, he headed straight for the newspaper table in the lobby and made a survey of what was available. He found nothing in the foreign-language papers. Those in his own language reported rumors, cited fluctuating figures, reproduced official denials, and questioned their veracity. That explained the departure of the German and Austrian element. Nationals of other countries evidently knew nothing, suspected nothing, and were not yet concerned. “Nothing is to be said about it!” thought Aschenbach anxiously, tossing the papers back on the table. “It is to be hushed up!” Yet at the same time his heart swelled with delight over the adventure the outside world was about to embark upon. For passion, like crime, is antithetical to the smooth operation and prosperity of day-to-day existence, and can only welcome every loosening of the fabric of society, every upheaval and disaster in the world, since it can vaguely hope to profit thereby. And so Aschenbach felt a morose satisfaction at the officially concealed goings-on in the dirty alleyways of Venice, that nasty secret which had merged with his own innermost secret and which he, too, was so intent on keeping: he was in love and concerned only that Tadzio might leave, and he realized not without horror that in the event he would not know what to make of his life.","Back at the hotel he went straight to the reading table in the lobby with the newspapers and flipped through several of them. He found nothing in the non-German ones. Those from home, however, offered up rumors, cited contradictory statistics, quoted official denials and questioned their veracity. That explained the sudden disappearance of the German and Austrian contingents. The guests of other nationalities apparently knew nothing; unsuspecting, they felt no need for alarm. This is supposed to be a secret, the excited Aschenbach thought, tossing the papers back on the table. It’s being kept quiet. But at the same time his heart was filled with happiness at the adventure the outside world was getting into, for passion, like criminality, cannot abide the security and welfare of everyday proceedings. It welcomes any relaxation of bourgeois law and order, any chaos and disruption in the world at large, cherishing the nebulous hope of finding some advantage. Thus Aschenbach felt a vague satisfaction at what was going on under the cover of official silence in the squalid alleys of Venice—at the merger of this terrible citywide secret with his own most personal one, which had been so important for him to protect. Being in love, he worried only that Tadzio might leave, recognizing with a trace of horror that he might not know how to go on living if that should happen."
"Was er gesehen, war gewiß in keiner Einzelheit auffallend gewesen. Man war nicht vor der Mutter zu Tische gegangen, man hatte sie erwartet, sie ehrerbietig begrüßt und beim Eintritt in den Saal gebräuchliche Formen beobachtet. Allein das alles hatte sich so ausdrücklich, mit einem solchen Akzent von Zucht, Verpflichtung und Selbstachtung dargestellt, daß Aschenbach sich sonderbar ergriffen fühlte. Er zögerte noch einige Augenblicke, ging dann auch seinerseits in den Speisesaal hinüber und ließ sich sein Tischchen anweisen, das, wie er mit einer kurzen Regung des Bedauerns feststellte, sehr weit von dem der polnischen Familie entfernt war.","Certainly no detail of what he saw was striking. They hadn't eaten in front of their mother, they had waited for her, greeted her respectfully, and observed the usual forms as they entered the hall. But all of this was presented so explicitly, with such an emphasis on discipline, obligation, and self-respect, that Aschenbach felt strangely moved. He hesitated a few more moments, then went over to the dining room and asked to be seated at his table, which, as he realized with a momentary regret, was very far from that of the Polish family.","What he saw had not been unusual in the slightest detail. They had not preceded the mother to the table; they had waited, greeted her with respect, and observed the customary forms on entering the room. But it had taken place so pointedly, with such an accent of training, duty, and self-respect, that Aschenbach felt peculiarly touched by it all. He delayed for a few moments, then he too crossed into the dining-room, and was assigned to his table, which, as he noted with a brief touch of regret, was very far removed from that of the Polish family.","There was certainly nothing the least bit remarkable about what he had seen. The children had not gone in before their mother; they had waited for her, greeted her deferentially, and observed the customary formalities when entering the dining room. Yet it had all been done so deliberately, with such concern for discipline, duty, and self-esteem that Aschenbach felt strangely moved. He hesitated a few moments more, then he too made his way to the dining room and was shown to his table, which, he noted with a brief stir of regret, was at some remove from that of the Polish family.","As far as the details were concerned, there was nothing particularly remarkable about what he had witnessed. One doesn’t sit down at table before mother has arrived; one waits for her, greeting her respectfully before going to dine, in observance of correct etiquette. Yet the whole ceremony had been performed so decisively, with such a strong accent of good breeding, devotion to duty and self-respect, that Aschenbach found it strangely arresting. He lingered a few moments longer. Then he, too, entered the dining room and was shown to his table, which, he noticed with a fleeting pang of regret, was quite far from the one where the Polish family was seated."

"Damit ein bedeutendes Geistesprodukt auf der Stelle eine breite und tiefe Wirkung zu üben vermöge, muß eine tiefe Verwandtschaft, ja Übereinstimmung zwischen dem persönlichen Schicksal seines Urhebers und dem allgemeinen des mitlebenden Geschlechtes bestehen. Die Menschen wissen nicht, warum sie einem Kunstwerk Ruhm bereiten. Weit entfernt von Kennerschaft, glauben sie hundert Vorzüge daran zu entdecken, um so viel Teilnahme zu rechtfertigen; aber der eigentliche Grund ihres Beifalls ist ein Unwägbares, ist Sympathie. Aschenbach hatte es einmal an wenig sichtbarer Stelle unmittelbar ausgesprochen, daß beinahe alles Große, was dastehe, als ein Trotzdem dastehe, trotz Kummer und Qual, Armut, Verlassenheit, Körperschwäche, Laster, Leidenschaft und tausend Hemmnissen zustande gekommen sei. Aber das war mehr als eine Bemerkung, es war eine Erfahrung, war geradezu die Formel seines Lebens und Ruhmes, der Schlüssel zu seinem Werk; und was Wunder also, wenn es auch der sittliche Charakter, die äußere Gebärde seiner eigentümlichsten Figuren war?","In order for an important intellectual product to be able to exert a broad and deep effect on the spot, there must be a deep relationship, even agreement, between the personal fate of its author and the general fate of the living generation. People don't know why they give glory to a work of art. Far from connoisseurship, they think they discover a hundred merits to justify so much participation; but the real reason for their applause is something imponderable, it is sympathy. Aschenbach once said in an inconspicuous place that almost everything great that is there, as a nevertheless, has come about despite grief and torment, poverty, loneliness, physical weakness, vice, passion and a thousand obstacles. But that was more than a remark, it was an experience, it was the very formula of his life and fame, the key to his work; and what wonder, then, if it was also the moral character, the outward gestures of his most peculiar figures?","In order that a significant work of the mind may exert immediately some broad and deep effect, a secret relationship, or even conformity, must exist between the personal destiny of the author and the common destiny of his contemporaries. People do not know why they raise a work of art to fame. Far from being connoisseurs, they believe that they see in it hundreds of virtues which justify so much interest; but the true reason for their applause is an unconscious sympathy. Aschenbach had once stated quite plainly in some remote place that nearly everything great which comes into being does so in spite of something—in spite of sorrow or suffering, poverty, destitution, physical weakness, depravity, passion, or a thousand other handicaps. But that was not merely an observation; it was a discovery, the formula of his life and reputation, the key to his work. And what wonder then that it was also the distinguishing moral trait, the dominating gesture, of his most characteristic figures?","For a major product of the intellect to make an immediate broad and deep impact it must rest upon a secret affinity, indeed, a congruence between the personal destiny of its author and the collective destiny of his generation. The people do not know why they bestow fame upon a given work of art. Though far from connoisseurs, they believe they have discovered a hundred virtues to justify such enthusiasm, yet the true basis for their acclaim is an imponderable, mere affinity. Once, in a less than conspicuous passage, Aschenbach stated outright that nearly everything great owes its existence to “despites”: despite misery and affliction, poverty, desolation, physical debility, vice, passion, and a thousand other obstacles. But it was more than an observation; it was his experience, the very formula of his life and fame, the key to his work. Was it any wonder, therefore, that it likewise informed the moral makeup and external demeanor of his most representative protagonists?","For an imaginative work of any significance to make an on-the-spot impact that is both broad and deep, there must be some unspoken affinity, indeed basic agreement between the individual destiny of the author and the general one of his contemporaries and fellow citizens. People don’t know why they celebrate a particular work of art. Far removed from any expert knowledge, they convince themselves of having uncovered a hundred different examples of its superiority, which then serve to justify their enthusiasm. But the real reason for their praise is something incalculable—sympathetic attraction. Once, in a relatively obscure passage, Aschenbach had stated as much outright, writing that practically everything great that exists does so in spite, having come into existence in spite of worry and anguish, of poverty, isolation, physical weakness, vice, overheated passions and various thousands of other obstacles. This was more than a remark. It was personal experience; it was almost the magic formula for his life and fame, the key to his work. Can there be any wonder, then, that it was also the personal ethos, the public comportment of those characters most idiosyncratically his own?"
"—Allerdings. Aber ich habe die Gondel nur genommen, um mich nach San",-However. But I only took the gondola to go to San,"Aschenbach replied: ""Of course. But I have just taken the gondola to get me across to San Marco.","“I am,” Aschenbach parried, “but I hired the gondola to take me only as far as San Marco.",“Yes indeed. But I only hired the gondola to take me over to San Marco.
"—Das ist meine Sache. Vielleicht will ich mein Gepäck in Verwahrung geben. Sie werden umkehren. Er blieb still. Das Ruder plätscherte, das Wasser schlug dumpf an den Bug. Und das Reden und Raunen begann wieder: der Gondolier sprach zwischen den Zähnen mit sich selbst.","-That's my thing. Maybe I want to put my luggage in custody. You will turn back. He remained silent. The oar splashed, the water hit the bow with a dull thump. And the talking and murmuring began again: the gondolier was talking to himself between his teeth.","He said: ""That is my affair. Perhaps I want to put my things in storage. You will turn back. "" There was silence. The oar splashed, the water thudded against the bow. And the talking and whispering began again. The gondolier was talking to himself between his teeth.","“That is my business,” he said. “Perhaps I wish to deposit my luggage there. You will turn back.” Silence. The oar plashed; the water thudded against the prow. Presently the muttering and murmuring commenced again: the gondolier was talking to himself between his teeth.","“That’s my affair. Perhaps I want to store my luggage. You’ll turn around immediately.” Silence ensued. The oar splashed, and the water lapped dully against the prow. And the murmuring and muttering began again: the gondolier had resumed talking to himself through his teeth."
"Einmal jedoch, eines Abends, begab es sich anders. Die polnischen Geschwister hatten nebst ihrer Gouvernante bei der Hauptmahlzeit im großen Saale gefehlt,—mit Besorgnis hatte Aschenbach es wahrgenommen. Er erging sich nach Tische, sehr unruhig über ihren Verbleib, in Abendanzug und Strohhut vor dem Hotel, zu Füßen der Terrasse, als er plötzlich die nonnenähnlichen Schwestern mit der Erzieherin und vier Schritte hinter ihnen Tadzio im Lichte der Bogenlampen auftauchen sah. Offenbar kamen sie von der Dampferbrücke, nachdem sie aus irgendeinem Grunde in der Stadt gespeist. Auf dem Wasser war es wohl kühl gewesen; Tadzio trug eine dunkelblaue Seemanns-Überjacke mit goldenen Knöpfen und auf dem Kopf eine zugehörige Mütze. Sonne und Seeluft verbrannten ihn nicht, seine Hautfarbe war marmorhaft gelblich geblieben wie zu Beginn; doch schien er blässer heute als sonst, sei es infolge der Kühle oder durch den bleichenden Mondschein der Lampen. Seine ebenmäßigen Brauen zeichneten sich schärfer ab, seine Augen dunkelten tief. Er war schöner, als es sich sagen läßt, und Aschenbach empfand wie schon oftmals mit Schmerzen, daß das Wort die sinnliche Schönheit nur zu preisen, nicht wiederzugeben vermag.","But once, one evening, things happened differently. The Polish siblings, along with their governess, were absent from the main meal in the large hall—Aschenbach noticed this with concern. He was walking towards the table, very worried about their whereabouts, in evening suit and straw hat in front of the hotel, at the foot of the terrace, when he suddenly saw the nun-like sisters with the governess and Tadzio four paces behind them appear in the light of the arc lamps. Apparently they came from the steamer bridge, having fed into town for some reason. It must have been cool on the water; Tadzio was wearing a dark blue seaman's overcoat with gold buttons and a matching cap on his head. Sun and sea air did not burn him, his skin color remained marble-like yellowish as at the beginning; but he seemed paler today than usual, either from the coolness or from the paling moonlight of the lamps. His even brows stood out more sharply, his eyes darkened deeply. He was more beautiful than can be said, and Aschenbach was painfully aware, as so often before, that words can only praise sensual beauty, not render it.","Once, however, one evening, things turned out differently. The Polish children and their governess had been missing at dinner in the large hall; Aschenbach had noted this uneasily. After the meal, disturbed by their absence, Aschenbach was walking in evening dress and straw hat in front of the hotel at the foot of the terrace, when suddenly he saw the nunlike sisters appear in the light of the arc-lamp, accompanied by their governess and with Tadzio a few steps behind. Evidently they were coming from the steamer pier after having dined for some reason in the city. It must have been cool on the water; Tadzio was wearing a dark blue sailor overcoat with gold buttons, and on his head he had a cap to match. The sun and sea air had not browned him; his skin still had the same yellow marble colour as at first. It even seemed paler to-day than usual, whether from the coolness or from the blanching moonlight of the lamps. His regular eyebrows showed up more sharply, the darkness of his eyes was deeper. It is hard to say how beautiful he was; and Aschenbach was distressed, as he had often been before, by the thought that words can only evaluate sensuous beauty, but not re-give it.","Once, however, one evening, something different happened. The Polish boy and his sisters together with their governess had failed to come to dinner in the main dining room, as Aschenbach noted with alarm. After the meal, worried about their absence, he was pacing in evening dress and a straw hat in front of the hotel at the foot of the terrace when all at once he spied the nunlike sisters with their companion and, four steps behind them, Tadzio, emerging into the light of the arc lamps. They were obviously on their way from the vaporetto landing, having dined in the city for some reason. It must have been cool on the water: Tadzio was wearing a navy blue pea jacket with gold buttons and a matching cap. Sunshine and sea air did not tan him, and his skin had the same yellowish marble hue as at the outset, but today he looked paler than usual, whether because of the cool air or the bleaching effect of the lamps’ lunar light. His symmetrical eyebrows stood out more sharply; his eyes were a deep, dark shade. He was more beautiful than words can convey, and Aschenbach felt acutely, as he had often felt before, that language can only praise physical beauty, not reproduce it.","On one occasion, however, in the evening, things turned out differently. The Polish children and their governess had been absent from dinner in the main dining room—a fact that Aschenbach had noted with great concern. He was getting some fresh air after the meal, strolling in formal evening attire and a straw hat at the foot of the hotel’s front terrace, feeling quite uneasy about their whereabouts, when he suddenly saw the nunlike sisters and their tutor appear in the light of the arc lamps. Tadzio was four steps behind. They were obviously returning from the vaporetto landing, having dined, for whatever reason, in the city. It must have been cool out on the water. Tadzio wore a dark blue seaman’s jacket with gold buttons and a matching cap on his head. He seemed to be impervious to the burning sun and the harsh sea air—his skin retained its original marble yellow—but today he appeared even paler than usual, either because of the chill or the bleaching effect of the artificial moonlight. His even brows emerged more sharply, and his eyes shone deep and black. He was more beautiful than words can express, and Aschenbach was painfully aware, as so often before, that words can only praise physical beauty, not reproduce it."
"weißblühende Allee, welche, Tavernen, Bazare, Pensionen zu beiden","white-flowered avenue, which, taverns, bazaars, inns to both","He gave instructions to have his luggage taken to the beach hotel, and followed the cart through the avenue, the white-blossomed avenue which, lined on both sides with taverns, shops, and boarding houses, runs across the island to the shore.","He gave instructions for his luggage to be taken to the Hôtel des Bains and followed the cart along the avenue, the white-blossoming tree-lined avenue which, flanked by taverns, bazaars, and boardinghouses, ran straight across the island to the beach.","He instructed the man to take his luggage to the beach hotel, then followed the cart down the avenue, that white-blossomed avenue lined on both sides with taverns, bazaars and pensioni that runs straight across the island to the beach."
"Es war ein Lied, das jemals gehört zu haben der Einsame sich nicht erinnerte; ein dreister Schlager in unverständlichem Dialekt und ausgestattet mit einem Lach-Refrain, in den die Bande regelmäßig aus vollem Halse einfiel. Es hörten hierbei sowohl die Worte wie auch die Begleitung der Instrumente auf, und nichts blieb übrig als ein rhythmisch irgendwie geordnetes, aber sehr natürlich behandeltes Lachen, das namentlich der Solist mit großem Talent zu täuschendster Lebendigkeit zu gestalten wußte. Er hatte bei wiederhergestelltem künstlerischen Abstand zwischen ihm und den Herrschaften seine ganze Frechheit wiedergefunden, und sein Kunstlachen, unverschämt zur Terrasse emporgesandt, war Hohngelächter. Schon gegen das Ende des artikulierten Teiles der Strophe schien er mit einem unwiderstehlichen Kitzel zu kämpfen. Er schluchzte, seine Stimme schwankte, er preßte die Hand gegen den Mund, er verzog die Schultern, und im gegebenen Augenblick brach, heulte und platzte das unbändige Lachen aus ihm hervor, mit solcher Wahrheit, daß es ansteckend wirkte und sich den Zuhörern mitteilte, daß auch auf der Terrasse eine gegenstandslose und nur von sich selbst lebende Heiterkeit um sich griff. Dies aber eben schien des Sängers Ausgelassenheit zu verdoppeln. Er beugte die Knie, er schlug die Schenkel, er hielt sich die Seiten, er wollte sich ausschütten, er lachte nicht mehr, er schrie; er wies mit dem Finger hinauf, als gäbe es nichts Komischeres, als die lachende Gesellschaft dort oben, und endlich lachte dann alles im Garten und auf der Veranda, bis zu den Kellnern, Liftboys und Hausdienern in den Türen.","It was a song the lonely one did not remember ever having heard; a brazen hit in an incomprehensible dialect and equipped with a laugh chorus, which the gang regularly joined in at the top of their lungs. At this point, both the words and the accompaniment of the instruments ended, and nothing remained but a rhythmically somehow ordered, but treated very naturally laughter, which the soloist in particular knew how to shape with great talent to the most deceptive liveliness. When the artistic distance between himself and the gentlemen had been restored, he had regained all his impudence, and his artificial laughter, sent impudently up to the terrace, was derisive laughter. Even towards the end of the articulated part of the verse he seemed to be struggling with an irresistible thrill. He sobbed, his voice shook, he pressed his hand to his mouth, he hunched his shoulders, and at the right moment he broke, howled and burst out in unbridled laughter, with such truth that it was contagious and communicated to the listeners, that even on the terrace a non-objective cheerfulness, living only from itself, was spreading. But this seemed to double the exuberance of the singer. He bent his knees, he hit his thighs, he held his sides, he wanted to throw himself out, he stopped laughing, he screamed; he pointed his finger as if there was nothing funnier than the laughing company up there, and then finally everyone in the garden and on the veranda laughed, down to the waiters, elevator boys and house servants in the doors.","It was a rousing song which the recluse never recalled having heard before, a ""big number"" in incomprehensible dialect, with a laugh refrain in which the troupe joined regularly at the tops of their voices. At this point both the words and the accompaniment of the instruments stopped, with nothing left but a laugh which was somehow arranged rhythmically although very naturally done—and the soloist especially showed great talent in giving it a most deceptive vitality. At the renewal of his professional distance from the audience he had recovered all his boldness again, and the artificial laugh that he directed up towards the terrace was derisive. Even before the end of the articulate portion of the strophe, he seemed to struggle against an irresistible tickling. He gulped, his voice trembled, he pressed his hand over his mouth, he contorted his shoulders; and at the proper moment the ungovernable laugh broke out of him, burst into such real cackles that it was infectious and communicated itself to the audience, so that on the terrace also an unfounded hilarity, living off itself alone, started up. But this seemed to double the singer's exuberance. He bent his knees, he slapped his thighs, he nearly split himself; he no longer laughed, he shrieked. He pointed up with his finger, as though nothing were more comic than the laughing guests there, and finally everyone in the garden and on the verandah was laughing, even to the waiters, bell boys, and house-servants in the doorways.","It was a song the solitary traveler could not recall having heard before, a brash popular number in an unintelligible dialect and with a refrain of laughter blared out at regular intervals by all four. Words and accompaniment both would then cease, giving way to a rhythmic laughter, patterned in its way, yet very natural-sounding, and made to seem especially lifelike by the talent of the soloist. The artistic distance between him and the distinguished guests having now been reestablished, all his impudence returned, and the artificial laughter he shamelessly aimed up at the terrace was a laughter of mockery. Each time he came to the end of the words in a stanza, he seemed to be battling against an uncontrollable urge: he would choke, his voice would falter, he would press his hand to his mouth and hunch his shoulders till at just the proper moment an unbridled laugh would break, burst, bellow out of him and with such verisimilitude that it had a contagious effect on the audience, causing an objectless, self-perpetuating hilarity to take hold on the terrace as well. This seemed only to redouble the singer’s exuberance. He bent his knees, slapped his thighs, clutched his sides, he nearly exploded, shrieking now rather than laughing; he pointed to the terrace, as if there were nothing more amusing than the people laughing up there, and before long everyone was laughing, everyone in the garden and on the verandah, including the waiters, lift attendants, and porters in the doorways.","It was a song the solitary Aschenbach could never remember having heard before, an audacious novelty number, sung in incomprehensible dialect and topped by a chorus in which the entire ensemble laughed as hard as it could. Each time that part came round, lyrics as well as accompaniment ceased, leaving nothing but laughing, which was somehow organized yet still performed quite naturally, especially by the soloist with his great talent for imitation. With the artistic distance between himself and his patrons now restored, he had rediscovered his former insolence, and the simulated laughter he directed unabashedly up at the terrace was that of mockery. Even before the end of every articulated verse, he seemed to be struggling against an irresistible tickle. He sobbed, his voice wavered, he pressed hand to mouth and coiled his shoulders, and at the proper moment unconstrained laughter burst, escaped and howled forth so true to life that it became infectious and spread among the audience, so that the terrace as well was seized by a hilarity without object, feeding only on itself. This just seemed to make the soloist doubly boisterous. He bent his knees, slapped his thighs, held his sides and generally split a gut, no longer laughing, but screaming. He pointed his finger in the air as if there were nothing more comical than the laughing audience above, and in the end everyone in the garden and on the veranda was laughing, right down to the waiters, elevator boys and servants in the doorways."
* * * * *,* * * * *,"You stay here; and when you no longer see me, then you go too.""","And when thou seest me no more, then thou too shalt go.”","You stay here, and only when you see me no more, are you to go, too.”"
"Aschenbach war versucht, ihm mit dem Finger zu drohen. »Dir aber rat ich Kritobulos«, dachte er lächelnd, »geh ein Jahr auf Reisen! Denn soviel brauchst du mindestens Zeit zur Genesung.« Und dann frühstückte er große, vollreife Erdbeeren, die er von einem Händler erstand. Es war sehr warm geworden, obgleich die Sonne die Dunstschicht des Himmels nicht zu durchdringen vermochte. Trägheit fesselte den Geist, indes die Sinne die ungeheure und betäubende Unterhaltung der Meeresstille genossen. Zu erraten, zu erforschen, welcher Name es sei, der ungefähr »Adgio« lautete, schien dem ernsten Mann eine angemessene, vollkommen ausfüllende Aufgabe und Beschäftigung. Und mit Hilfe einiger polnischer Erinnerungen stellte er fest, daß »Tadzio« gemeint sein müsse, die Abkürzung von »Tadeusz« und im Anrufe »Tadziu« lautend. Tadzio badete. Aschenbach, der ihn aus den Augen verloren hatte, entdeckte seinen Kopf, seinen Arm, mit dem er rudernd ausholte, weit draußen im Meer; denn das Meer mochte flach sein bis weit hinaus. Aber schon schien man besorgt um ihn, schon riefen Frauenstimmen nach ihm von den Hütten, stießen wiederum diesen Namen aus, der den Strand beinahe wie eine Losung beherrschte und mit seinen weichen Mitlauten, seinem gezogenen u-Ruf am Ende, etwas zugleich Süßes und Wildes hatte: »Tadziu, Tadziu!« Er gehorchte, er lief, das widerstrebende Wasser mit den Beinen zu Schaum schlagend, zurückgeworfenen Kopfes durch die Flut; und zu sehen, wie die lebendige Gestalt, vormännlich hold und herb, mit triefenden Locken und schön wie ein zarter Gott, herkommend aus den Tiefen von Himmel und Meer, dem Elemente entstieg und entrann: Dieser Anblick gab mythische Vorstellungen ein, er war wie Dichterkunde von anfänglichen Zeiten, vom Ursprung der Form und von der Geburt der Götter. Aschenbach lauschte mit geschlossenen Augen auf diesen in seinem Innern antönenden Gesang; und abermals dachte er, daß es hier gut sei und daß er bleiben wolle.","Aschenbach was tempted to threaten him with his finger. ""But I advise you, Kritobulos,"" he thought with a smile, ""go on a journey for a year! Because that's the minimum time you need to recover.” And then he ate breakfast, large, ripe strawberries that he bought from a vendor. It had become very warm, although the sun could not penetrate the haze of the sky. Inertia enthralled the mind while the senses enjoyed the immense and stupefying amusement of the stillness of the sea. To guess, to research what name it was that read something like ""Adgio,"" seemed to the serious man an adequate, completely fulfilling task and occupation. And with the help of some Polish memories, he established that ""Tadzio"" must be meant, the abbreviation of ""Tadeusz"" and in the phone call ""Tadziu"". Tadzio bathed. Aschenbach, who had lost sight of him, discovered his head, his arm, with which he was rowing, far out in the sea; for the sea might be flat far out. But already people seemed worried about him, women's voices were already calling him from the huts, again uttering this name, which dominated the beach almost like a slogan and with its soft consonants, its drawn u-call at the end, something sweet and wild at the same time had: ""Tadziu, Tadziu!"" He obeyed, he ran, beating the resisting water to foam with his legs, his head thrown back through the flood; and to see how the living figure, gentle and austere before a man, with flowing curls and beautiful like a delicate god, coming from the depths of sky and sea, rose from the elements and escaped: This sight inspired mythical ideas, it was like poetry of beginning times, of the origin of form, and of the birth of the gods. With his eyes closed, Aschenbach listened to the singing that sounded within him; and again he thought that it was good here and that he would stay.","Aschenbach was half minded to raise a warning finger. ""I advise you, Cristobulus,"" he thought, smiling, ""to travel for a year! For you need that much time at least to get over it."" And then he breakfasted on large ripe strawberries which he got from a peddler. It had become very warm, although the sun could no longer penetrate the blanket of mist in the sky. Laziness clogged his brain, even while his senses delighted in the numbing, drugging distractions of the ocean's stillness. To guess, to puzzle out just what name it was that sounded something like ""Adgio,"" seemed to the sober man an appropriate ambition, a thoroughly comprehensive pursuit. And with the aid of a few scrappy recollections of Polish he decided that they must mean Tadzio, the shortened form of Tadeusz, and sounding like Tadziu when it is called. Tadzio was bathing. Aschenbach, who had lost sight of him, spied his head and the arm with which he was propelling himself, far out in the water; for the sea must have been smooth for a long distance out. But already people seemed worried about him; women's voices were calling after him from the bathing houses, uttering this name again and again. It almost dominated the beach like a battle-cry, and with its soft consonants, its long drawn u-note at the end, it had something at once sweet and wild about it: ""Tadziu! Tadziu!"" He turned back; beating the resistent water into a foam with his legs he hurried, his head bent down over the waves. And to see how this living figure, graceful and clean-cut in its advance, with dripping curls, and lovely as some frail god, came up out of the depths of sky and sea, rose and separated from the elements—this spectacle aroused a sense of myth, it was like some poet's recovery of time at its beginning, of the origin of forms and the birth of gods. Aschenbach listened with closed eyes to this song ringing within him, and he thought again that it was pleasant here, and that he would like to remain.","Aschenbach was tempted to shake a finger at them. “I advise you, Critobulus,” he thought with a smile, “to travel for a year. For you will need at least that long to recover.” Then he breakfasted on some large, fully ripe strawberries he had purchased from a peddler. It had grown very hot, though the sun was unable to pierce the layer of haze in the sky. Lethargy fettered the mind even as the senses enjoyed the vast, benumbing pleasure of the ocean’s calm. The serious Aschenbach found it a suitable, perfectly satisfying use of his time to guess at or postulate on the name that sounded like Adgio, and with the aid of some Polish reminiscences he determined that it must be Tadzio, the pet name for Tadeusz, which becomes Tadziu in direct address. * Tadzio was bathing. Aschenbach, who had lost sight of him, spotted his head, then his arm rising paddlelike from the water far out at sea, the sea being most likely shallow for quite a distance. But already he seemed a cause for concern; already women’s voices were calling out to him from the cabanas, once more shouting the name that dominated the beach almost like a catchword, its soft consonants and long-drawn-out final u making it at once sweet and wild: “Tadziu! Tadziu!” Back he came, running through the waves, his legs beating the resistant water into foam, his head flung back, and to see so vibrant a figure, with the grace and austerity of early manhood, locks dripping, fair as a gentle god, emerging from the depths of sea and sky, escaping the watery element—it was enough to inspire mythical associations, like the lay of a bard about times primeval, about the origin of form and the birth of the gods. His eyes closed, Aschenbach harkened to the chant welling up within him and thought again that being here was good and he would stay.","Aschenbach was sorely tempted to shake a finger at him. “And you, Critobulos,” he thought with a smile, “spend a year traveling. You’ll need at least that long to recover.” And then he ate a second breakfast, some large, perfectly ripe strawberries bought from a vendor. It had grown very hot, though the sun had never managed to break through the thin layer of mist in the sky. Laziness overcame his mind as his senses reveled in the vast, hypnotic spectacle of the sea. To guess or otherwise ascertain the Christian name corresponding to “Adgio” seemed like a perfectly appropriate and satisfying way for this serious man to spend his time. Thanks to some recollections about the Polish language, he succeeded in determining that the name had to be “Tadzio,” a shortened form of “Tadeusz” inflected to “Tadziu” as a form of address. Tadzio was swimming. Aschenbach, who had lost sight of him, spotted his head, then his arm, one hand waving with a paddling motion, far out in the water. The sea obviously remained shallow for some distance. Nonetheless, there was already concern for his safety, already women’s voices were calling out to him from the huts, repeatedly crying out that name, whose soft consonants and final drawn-out u dominated the beach almost like a battle cry, possessing something both sweet and wild: “Tadziu! Tadziu!” He turned and ran back against the current, his head thrown back, his legs beating the resisting water to foam. And to watch this mortal figure, boyishly fair yet precociously dour, emerge sprinting from the element with dripping locks, beautiful, like a tender young god born of the depths of air and sea—the sight conjured up mythic images. It was like something from a poetic saga about the dawn of time, when the universe was originally given form and the gods were born. Aschenbach shut his eyes and listened to the song playing within him, and once more he thought that it was good where he was and that he wanted to stay."
"Er war früh auf, wie sonst wohl bei pochendem Arbeitsdrange, und vor den meisten am Strand, wenn die Sonne noch milde war und das Meer weiß blendend in Morgenträumen lag. Er grüßte menschenfreundlich den Wächter der Sperre, grüßte auch vertraulich den barfüßigen Weißbart, der ihm die Stätte bereitet, das braune Schattentuch ausgespannt, die Möbel der Hütte hinaus auf die Plattform gerückt hatte, und ließ sich nieder. Drei Stunden oder vier waren dann sein, in denen die Sonne zur Höhe stieg und furchtbare Macht gewann, in denen das Meer tiefer und tiefer blaute und in denen er Tadzio sehen durfte.","He was up early, as usual with a throbbing urge to work, and on the beach before most people, when the sun was still mild and the sea was dazzling white in morning dreams. He politely greeted the guard of the barrier, also confidentially greeted the barefoot whitebeard who prepared the place for him, who had stretched out the brown shade cloth, pushed the furniture of the hut out onto the platform, and sat down. Then it was three or four hours, during which the sun rose high and gained terrible power, during which the sea blued deeper and deeper, and during which he was allowed to see Tadzio.","He was up as early as he used to be when under the driving pressure of work, and was on the beach before most people, when the sun was still mild and the sea lay blinding white in the dreaminess of morning. He spoke amiably to the guard of the private beach, and also spoke familiarly to the barefoot, white-bearded old man who had prepared his place for him, stretching the brown canopy and bringing the furniture of the cabin out on the platform. Then he took his seat. There would now be three or four hours in which the sun mounted and gained terrific strength, the sea a deeper and deeper blue, and he might look at Tadzio.","He would rise early—as was his wont when under the unrelenting pressure of his work—and was one of the first on the beach, when the sun was still mild and the sea a dazzling white, still dreaming. He would greet the gate attendant amiably and nod another friendly greeting to the barefoot graybeard who readied his place for him—pulled out the brown awning and moved the furniture out of the cabana—whereupon he settled in. He then had three or four hours during which the sun climbed to its zenith and grew to a frightening intensity, during which the sea turned a deeper and deeper blue, and during which he could watch Tadzio.","He would get up early, as though still driven by his compulsive work habits, and arrive at the beach before most of the others, when the sun was still mild and the sea dazzlingly white in morning dreams. He would amiably greet the attendant at the gate and would also exchange familiar hellos with the barefoot old-timer, who always had his spot well-prepared —brown awning unfurled, beach furniture removed and set up on deck—before settling into his chair. The next three or four hours would then be his, hours in which the sun climbed in the sky and took on a terrible intensity, in which the ocean turned a deeper and deeper blue and in which he was permitted to watch Tadzio."

"Eine Stunde verging, bis sie erschien. Man war angekommen und war es nicht; man hatte keine Eile und fühlte sich doch von Ungeduld getrieben. Die jungen Polenser, patriotisch angezogen auch wohl von den militärischen Hornsignalen, die aus der Gegend der öffentlichen Gärten her über das Wasser klangen, waren auf Deck gekommen, und, vom Asti begeistert, brachten sie Lebehochs auf die drüben exerzierenden Bersaglieri aus. Aber widerlich war es zu sehen, in welchen Zustand den aufgestutzten Greisen seine falsche Gemeinschaft mit der Jugend gebracht hatte. Sein altes Hirn hatte dem Weine nicht wie die jugendlich rüstigen Stand zu halten vermocht, er war kläglich betrunken. Verblödeten Blicks, eine Zigarette zwischen den zitternden Fingern, schwankte er, mühsam das Gleichgewicht haltend, auf der Stelle, vom Rausche vorwärts und rückwärts gezogen. Da er beim ersten Schritte gefallen wäre, getraute er sich nicht vom Fleck, doch zeigte er einen jammervollen Übermut, hielt jeden, der sich ihm näherte, am Knopfe fest, lallte, zwinkerte, kicherte, hob seinen beringten, runzeligen Zeigefinger zu alberner Neckerei und leckte auf abscheulich zweideutige Art mit der Zungenspitze die Mundwinkel. Aschenbach sah ihm mit finsteren Brauen zu, und wiederum kam ein Gefühl von Benommenheit ihn an, so, als zeige die Welt eine leichte, doch nicht zu hemmende Neigung, sich ins Sonderbare und Fratzenhafte zu entstellen; ein Gefühl, dem nachzuhängen freilich die Umstände ihn abhielten, da eben die stampfende Tätigkeit der Maschine aufs neue begann und das Schiff seine so nah dem Ziel unterbrochene Fahrt durch den Kanal von San Marco wieder aufnahm. So sah er ihn denn wieder, den erstaunlichsten Landungsplatz, jene blendende Komposition phantastischen Bauwerks, welche die Republik den ehrfürchtigen Blicken nahender Seefahrer entgegenstellte: die leichte Herrlichkeit des Palastes und die Seufzerbrücke, die Säulen mit Löw' und Heiligem am Ufer, die prunkend vortretende Flanke des Märchentempels, den Durchblick auf Torweg und Riesenuhr, und anschauend bedachte er, daß zu Lande, auf dem Bahnhof in Venedig anlangen, einen Palast durch eine Hintertür betreten heiße, und daß man nicht anders als wie nun er, als zu Schiffe, als über das hohe Meer die unwahrscheinlichste der Städte erreichen sollte.","An hour passed before she appeared. One had arrived and was not; one was in no hurry and yet one felt driven by impatience. The young Poles, patriotically attracted also by the military bugle calls that sounded across the water from the area around the public gardens, had come on deck, and, excited by the Asti, brought out cheers to the Bersaglieri on the other side, who were exercising. But it was disgusting to see the state in which his false association with youth had brought the pupated old man. His old brain had not been able to withstand the crying like the sprightly youthful ones, he was miserably drunk. Stunned eyes, a cigarette between his trembling fingers, he swayed, struggling to keep his balance, on the spot, pulled back and forth by the intoxication. As he would have fallen at the first step, he did not dare move, but he displayed a pitiful arrogance, grabbing the button of anyone who came near him, slurring, winking, giggling, raising his ringed, wrinkled index finger in silly teasing, and licked the corners of his mouth with the tip of his tongue in a hideously ambiguous way. Aschenbach watched him with dark brows, and again he felt dizzy, as if the world showed a slight but uncontrollable tendency to distort itself into the strange and grotesque; a feeling that circumstances prevented him from indulging in, just as the pounding activity of the engine began again and the ship resumed its journey through the San Marco Canal, which had been interrupted so near to its destination. So he saw it again, the most astonishing landing place, that dazzling composition of fantastic edifices, which the republic opposed to the reverent glances of approaching seafarers: the light splendor of the palace and the Bridge of Sighs, the columns with lions and saints on the bank, the magnificent protruding flank of the fairy tale temple, the view of the gateway and giant clock, and looking at it he thought that arriving at the train station in Venice on land means entering a palace through a back door, and that one cannot do otherwise than he does now, than on ships, than via the high seas should reach the most unlikely of cities.","An hour passed before it appeared. He had arrived, and yet he had not; no one was in any hurry, no one was driven by impatience. The young men from Pola, patriotically attracted by the military bugle calls which rang over the water from the vicinity of the public gardens, had come on deck, and warmed by their Asti, they burst out with cheers for the drilling bersagliere. But it was repulsive to see what a state the primped-up old man had been brought to by his comradeship with youth. His old head was not able to resist its wine like the young and robust: he was painfully drunk. With glazed eyes, a cigarette between his trembling fingers, he stood in one place, swaying backwards and forwards from giddiness, and balancing himself laboriously. Since he would have fallen at the first step, he did not trust himself from the spot—yet he showed a deplorable insolence, buttonholed everyone who came near him, stammered, winked, and tittered, lifted his wrinkled, ornamented index finger in a stupid attempt at bantering, while he licked the corers of his mouth with his tongue in the most abominably suggestive manner. Aschenbach observed him darkly, and a feeling of numbness came over him again, as though the world were displaying a faint but irresistible tendency to distort itself into the peculiar and the grotesque: a feeling which circumstances prevented him from surrendering himself to completely, for just then the pounding activity of the engines commenced again, and the ship, resuming a voyage which had been interrupted so near its completion, passed through the San Marco canal. So he saw it again, the most remarkable of landing places, that blinding composition of fantastic buildings which the Republic lays out before the eyes of approaching seafarers: the soft splendour of the palace, the Bridge of Sighs, on the bank the columns with lion and saint, the advancing, showy flank of the enchanted temple, the glimpse through to the archway, and the huge giant clock. And as he looked on he thought that to reach Venice by land, on the rail-road, was like entering a palace from the rear, and that the most unreal of cities should not be approached except as he was now doing, by ship, over the high seas.","It took the launch an hour to appear. The ship had arrived, yet it had not. There was no hurry, yet the passengers were impatient. The young men from Pola, their patriotism stimulated by the military bugle calls crossing the water from the vicinity of the Public Gardens, had come on deck and, full of Asti-induced ebullience, were cheering on the bersaglieri drilling there. But it was repugnant to behold the state to which the spruced-up fossil had been reduced by his spurious coalition with the young. His brain was too old to withstand the wine as his youthfully resilient companions had done: he was miserably drunk. Eyes glazed over, a cigarette between his trembling fingers, he swayed back and forth in his inebriation, laboriously keeping his balance. Since he would have fallen at the first step, he did not dare move, yet he displayed a pitiful exuberance, buttonholing everyone who came up to him, jabbering, winking, sniggering, lifting a wrinkled, ringed finger as a part of some fatuous teasing, and licking the corners of his mouth with the tip of his tongue in a revoltingly suggestive manner. Aschenbach watched him with a frown, and once more a feeling of numbness came over him, as if the world were moving ever so slightly yet intractably towards a strange and grotesque warping, a feeling which circumstances kept him from indulging in, however, because at that moment the pounding of the engine started up again and the ship, interrupted so near its destination, resumed its course through the San Marco Canal. And so he saw it once again, that most astounding of landing sites, that stunning composition of fantastic architecture offered up by the Republic to the reverent gaze of approaching seafarers, the ethereal splendor of the Palace and the Bridge of Sighs, the waterside columns with lion and saint, the majestically projecting flank of the fairy-tale basilica, and the view beyond of the gateway and giant clock, and taking it all in he mused that arriving in Venice by land, at the railway station, was tantamount to entering a palace by the back door and that one should approach this most improbable of cities only as he had now done by ship, over the seas.","An hour passed before it appeared. They had arrived and yet not arrived. There was no reason to hurry, yet they felt driven by impatience. The young clerks from Pola had had their usual patriotism excited by the bugle calls carrying across the water from the vicinity of the public gardens and had come up on deck. There, bolstered by asti spumante, they cheered on the bersaglieri exercising on the opposite shore. It was repulsive to observe the effect upon the aged fop of falsely kept company with youth. His old head had not stood the wine as those younger and hardier ones had, and he found himself in a lamentable state of drunkenness. Bleary-eyed, his cigarette trembling between his fingers, he swayed as he stood, struggling to maintain his balance against the back-and-forth pull of intoxication. He dared not take a step for fear of falling down, yet he still behaved with appalling presumption, grabbing at all who passed, babbling, winking, giggling, raising a wrinkled index finger and signet ring with each inane jest, his tongue flicking at the corners of his mouth all the while in a disgustingly suggestive manner. Aschenbach scowled at him and once again felt dazed, as if the world were subtly but relentlessly beginning to warp toward the bizarre and fragmentary. It was a feeling that external circumstances prevented him from pursuing, for at that very moment the engine resumed its pounding, and the ship, having stopped so short of its ultimate destination, started once more up the San Marco Canal. Thus he saw it again, that most awe-inspiring port, that dazzling arrangement of fantastic architecture with which the Republic has perennially greeted the reverent eyes of approaching seafarers: the easy majesty of the Palace of the Doges, the Bridge of Sighs, the pillars of the lion and saint by the Lagoon, the magnificent projected arm of the magical San Marco Basilica, the view beyond the gateway to the city and the giant clock. And he realized as he took this all in that arriving in Venice by land via the train station was like entering a palace through one of the back doors, that this most unlikely of cities should only be approached by ship, over high sea, as he was now doing."
"—Der Herr ist umsonst gefahren, sagte der Alte und hielt den Hut hin.","""The gentleman drove for free,"" said the old man, holding out his hat.","""The gentleman rode for nothing,"" the old man said, and held out his hat.","“You got a free ride, sir,” the old man said, holding his hat out.","“The gentleman has gotten a free ride,” the old man said, holding out his hat."
"Nach Mittag verließ er den Strand, kehrte ins Hotel zurück und ließ sich hinauf vor sein Zimmer fahren. Er verweilte dort drinnen längere Zeit vor dem Spiegel und betrachtete sein graues Haar, sein müdes und scharfes Gesicht. In diesem Augenblick dachte er an seinen Ruhm und daran, daß Viele ihn auf den Straßen kannten und ehrerbietig betrachteten, um seines sicher treffenden und mit Anmut gekrönten Wortes willen,—rief alle, äußeren Erfolge seines Talentes auf, die ihm irgend einfallen wollten und gedachte sogar seiner Nobilitierung. Er begab sich dann zum Lunch hinab in den Saal und speiste an seinem Tischchen. Als er nach beendeter Mahlzeit den Lift bestieg, drängte junges Volk, das gleichfalls vom Frühstück kam, ihm nach in das schwebende Kämmerchen, und auch Tadzio trat ein. Er stand ganz nahe bei Aschenbach, zum ersten Male so nah, daß dieser ihn nicht in bildmäßigem Abstand, sondern genau, mit den Einzelheiten seiner Menschlichkeit wahrnahm und erkannte. Der Knabe ward angeredet von irgend jemandem, und während er mit unbeschreiblich lieblichem Lächeln antwortete, trat er schon wieder aus, im ersten Stockwerk, rückwärts, mit niedergeschlagenen Augen. Schönheit macht schamhaft, dachte Aschenbach und bedachte sehr eindringlich, warum. Er hatte jedoch bemerkt, daß Tadzios Zähne nicht recht erfreulich waren: etwas zackig und blaß, ohne den Schmelz der Gesundheit und von eigentümlich spröder Durchsichtigkeit wie zuweilen bei Bleichsüchtigen. Er ist sehr zart, er ist kränklich, dachte Aschenbach. Er wird wahrscheinlich nicht alt werden. Und er verzichtete darauf, sich Rechenschaft über ein Gefühl der Genugtuung oder Beruhigung zu geben, das diesen Gedanken begleitete.","After noon he left the beach, returned to the hotel and had himself driven up to his room. He stayed in there for a long time in front of the mirror, looking at his gray hair, his tired and sharp face. At that moment he thought of his fame and of the fact that many knew him on the streets and looked at him respectfully, for the sake of his apt words, crowned with grace,—invoked all the outward successes of his talent that he could think of and thought of even its ennoblement. He then went down to the hall for lunch and ate at his little table. When he got into the elevator after the meal was over, young people, who were also coming from breakfast, pushed after him into the little suspended room, and Tadzio also entered. He was standing very close to Aschenbach, for the first time so close that Aschenbach saw and recognized him not from a pictorial distance, but precisely, with the details of his humanity. The boy was spoken to by someone, and while he answered with an indescribably lovely smile, he came out again, on the first floor, backwards, with downcast eyes. Beauty makes you bashful, Aschenbach thought and thought very hard why. He had noticed, however, that Tadzio's teeth were not particularly pleasing: somewhat jagged and pale, lacking the enamel of health and of a peculiarly brittle transparency, as is sometimes the case with people suffering from anaemia. He's very delicate, he's sickly, thought Aschenbach. He probably won't get old. And he refrained from accounting for any sense of satisfaction or reassurance that accompanied that thought.","A little past noon he left the beach, returned to the hotel, and was taken up to his room. He stayed there for some time in front of the mirror, looking at his grey hair, his tired sharp features. At this moment he thought of his reputation, and of the fact that he was often recognized on the streets and observed with respect, thanks to the sure aim and the appealing finish of his words. He called up all the exterior successes of his talent which he could think of, remembering also his elevation to the knighthood. Then he went down to the dining-hall for lunch, and ate at his little table. As he was riding up in the lift, after the meal was ended, a group of young people just coming from breakfast pressed into the swaying cage after him, and Tadzio entered too. He stood quite near to Aschenbach, for the first time so near that Aschenbach could see him, not with the aloofness of a picture, but in minute detail, in all his human particularities. The boy was addressed by someone or other, and as he was answering with an indescribably agreeable smile he stepped out again, on the second floor, walking backwards, and with his eyes lowered. "" Beauty makes modest,"" Aschenbach thought, and he tried insistently to explain why this was so. But he had noticed that Tadzio's teeth were not all they should be; they were somewhat jagged and pale. The enamel did not look healthy; it had a peculiar brittleness and transparency, as is often the case with anaemics. "" He is very frail, he is sickly,"" Aschenbach thought. ""In all probability he will not grow old."" And he refused to reckon with the feeling of gratification or reassurance which accompanied this notion.","After midday he left the beach, returned to the hotel, and went up to his room. There he spent quite some time before the mirror, studying his gray hair and pinched, weary face. Reflecting the while on his fame—people often recognized him on the street and gazed after him respectfully for the unerring precision and grace of his diction—he evoked all the outward signs of success he owed to his talent, even his noble title. He then went down to the dining room for lunch at his table. When he entered the lift after the meal, a group of young people also coming from lunch crowded into the floating cubicle after him, Tadzio amongst them. He stood quite close to Aschenbach, so close that for the first time he perceived him not as a distant work of art and, given the minute detail, acknowledged his human qualities. Someone addressed the boy, and while replying, with an indescribably winsome smile, he backed out at the next floor, his eyes cast down. Beauty breeds diffidence, thought Aschenbach, earnestly wondering why. He had noticed, however, that Tadzio’s teeth were less than attractive: a bit jagged and pale, lacking the gleam of health, and with that brittle, transparent quality sometimes found in anemics. He is very frail, he is sickly, thought Aschenbach. He’ll probably not live long. And he made no attempt to account for why he felt satisfied or consoled at the thought.","After twelve he left the beach, returned to the hotel and took the elevator up to his room. Inside, he stood before the mirror for some time gazing at his gray hair, at his weary and drawn face. He was thinking just then about his fame, about the people who recognized him on the street and stared with reverent awe, out of respect for his unerring, gracefully polished skill with words. He recalled every bit of worldly success he could muster and even reminisced about being awarded the title of nobility. He then went down to the dining room and ate lunch at his small table. Getting into the elevator after the meal, Aschenbach was pushed to the back of the suspended little cubicle by a crowd of young people, who had also just finished eating. Tadzio was among them. He was standing quite close to Aschenbach, closer than ever before, so that the latter, looking for the first time from a vantage other than that of picturesque distance, could see and observe him precisely, in human detail. Someone spoke to the boy as they reached the second floor, and although he was already getting off, he responded with an indescribably charming smile, stepping out backwards from the elevator and batting his eyes. Beauty makes bashful, Aschenbach thought, probing the question of why that should be the case. On the other hand, he had also noticed that Tadzio did not have the best of teeth: they were rather jagged and pale, lacking healthy luster and of that peculiar brittle translucence common among anemics. He’s quite delicate, even sickly, thought Aschenbach. He’s probably not long for this world. And he refused to analyze a certain feeling of satisfaction, or reassurance, which accompanied this thought."
—Zur Dampferstation also! sagte er mit einer halben Wendung rückwärts. Das Raunen verstummte. Er erhielt keine Antwort.,"—To the steamer station, then! he said with a half turn backwards. The murmuring stopped. He received no answer.","""To the steamer dock!"" he repeated, turning around completely and looking into the face of the gondolier who stood behind on a raised platform and towered up between him and the dun-coloured sky.","“To the vaporetto pier, I told you!” he said, half turning. The murmuring ceased, but no reply was forthcoming.","“See here, to the vaporetto landing,” he said over his shoulder. The muttering ceased, but he received no answer."
"Im Frisiermantel, unter den pflegenden Händen des Schwätzers im Stuhle zurückgelehnt, betrachtete er gequälten Blickes sein Spiegelbild.","In his peignoir, leaning back in his chair under the nurturing hands of the gossip, he looked at his reflection with a tormented look.","Beneath the barber's apron, leaning back in the chair under the gossiper's expert hands, he winced to observe his reflection in the mirror.","Draped in the hairdressing gown, leaning back in the chair under the prattler’s ministering hands, he peered in dismay at his image in the looking glass.","With a hairdressing gown draped over him, he leaned back in the chair under the latter’s soothing hands and stared at his reflection in a hand mirror, looking pained."
"Der Himmel war grau, der Wind feucht; Hafen und Inseln waren zurückgeblieben, und rasch verlor sich aus dem dunstigen Gesichtskreise alles Land.

"Der erste Blick fand ihn; die rote Masche auf seiner Brust war nicht zu verfehlen. Mit anderen beschäftigt, eine alte Planke als Brücke über den feuchten Graben der Sandburg zu legen, gab er rufend und mit dem Kopfe winkend seine Anweisungen zu diesem Werk. Es waren da mit ihm ungefähr zehn Genossen, Knaben und Mädchen, von seinem Alter und einige jünger, die in Zungen, polnisch, französisch und auch in Balkan-Idiomen durcheinander schwatzten. Aber sein Name war es, der am öftesten erklang. Offenbar war er begehrt, umworben, bewundert. Einer namentlich, Pole gleich ihm, ein stämmiger Bursche, der ähnlich wie »Jaschu« gerufen wurde, mit schwarzem, pomadisiertem Haar und leinenem Gürtelanzug, schien sein nächster Vasall und Freund. Sie gingen, als für diesmal die Arbeit am Sandbau beendigt war, umschlungen den Strand entlang, und der, welcher »Jaschu« gerufen wurde, küßte den Schönen.","The first look found him; you couldn't miss the red bow on his chest. Busy with others in laying an old plank as a bridge over the damp ditch of the sandcastle, he gave his instructions to the work, shouting and nodding his head. There were about ten comrades with him, boys and girls of his age and a few younger, chattering in tongues, Polish, French and also Balkan idioms. But it was his name that sounded the most. Apparently he was coveted, courted, admired. One in particular, Pole like him, a burly fellow, who was called something like ""Jaschu,"" with black, pomaded hair and a linen belt suit, seemed to be his closest vassal and friend. When the work on the sand was finished for the time being, they walked along the beach, embracing each other, and the one who was called ""Jaschu"" kissed the handsome man.","He was found at a glance; the red tie on his breast was not to be overlooked. Busied with the others in laying an old plank across the damp moat of the sand castle, he was nodding, and shouting instructions for this work. There were about ten companions with him, boys and girls of his age, and a few younger ones who were chattering with one another in Polish, French, and in several Balkan tongues. But it was his name which rang out most often. He was openly in demand, sought after, admired. One boy especially, like him a Pole, a stocky fellow who was called something like ""Jaschu,"" with sleek black hair and a belted linen coat, seemed to be his closest vassal and friend. When the work on the sand structure was finished for the time being, they walked aim in arm along the beach, and the boy who was called ""Jaschu"" kissed the beauty.","He located him at once: the red bow on his chest was unmistakable. Engaged with the others in laying an old plank as a bridge across the sand castle’s water-filled moat, he gave directions by shouts and head signals. He had ten or so companions, boys and girls—some his own age, some younger—chattering higgledy-piggledy in tongues: Polish, French, and even some Balkan languages. But his name was the most often heard. He was clearly sought after, courted, admired. One boy in particular, a Pole like him—a stocky fellow who was addressed as something like Jasiu and who had black, slicked-down hair and was wearing a belted linen suit—appeared to be his closest vassal and friend. When the current stage of work on the castle came to an end, they walked along the beach with their arms around each other, and the fellow addressed as Jasiu kissed the beautiful youth.","He located him at once—it was impossible to miss the red knot on his chest. Busy with some others laying down an old plank for a bridge across the castle’s damp moat, he called out instructions, nodding his head now and then. In addition to him, there were about ten other children, boys and girls, his own age and younger, who jabbered in tongues, mixing Polish, French and even Balkan languages. His name, however, was the one that was heard most often. Obviously he was coveted, courted, admired. One boy in particular, a fellow Pole called something like “Yashu,” seemed to be his highest vassal and closest friend: he was a strapping young lad with black pomaded hair in a linen jumpsuit. When work on the sandcastle had been temporarily completed, they walked arm in arm the length of the beach, with the one called “Yashu” kissing his beautiful friend."
"Wie irgend ein Liebender wünschte er, zu gefallen und empfand bittere Angst, daß es nicht möglich sein möchte. Er fügte seinem Anzüge jugendlich aufheiternde Einzelheiten hinzu, er legte Edelsteine an und benutzte Parfüms, er brauchte mehrmals am Tage viel Zeit für seine Toilette und kam geschmückt, erregt und gespannt zu Tische. Angesichts der süßen Jugend, die es ihm angetan, ekelte ihn sein alternder Leib, der Anblick seines grauen Haares, seiner scharfen Gesichtszüge stürzte ihn in Scham und Hoffnungslosigkeit. Es trieb ihn, sich körperlich zu erquicken und wiederherzustellen; er besuchte häufig den Coiffeur des Hauses.","Like any lover, he wished to please and felt bitter dread that it might not be possible. He added youthful cheering details to his suits, he wore jewels and used perfumes, he spent a lot of time at his toilet several times a day, and came to the table adorned, excited, and tense. Faced with the sweetness of youth that attracted him, his aging body disgusted him, the sight of his gray hair and sharp features plunged him into shame and hopelessness. He was driven to refresh and restore himself physically; he often visited the hairdresser of the house.","Like any lover, he wanted to please; and he felt a bitter anguish lest it might not be possible. He added bright youthful details to his dress, he put on jewels, and used perfumes. During the day he often spent much time over his toilet, and came to the table strikingly dressed, excited, and in suspense. In the light of the sweet youthfulness which had done this to him, he detested his aging body. The sight of his grey hair, his sharp features, plunged him into shame and hopelessness. It induced him to attempt rejuvenating his body and appearance. He often visited the hotel barber.","Like any lover, he wished to please and dreaded the thought that it might be impossible. He added cheery, youthful touches to his wardrobe, wore jewels, and used scent; he spent long hours several times a day at his toilet, coming to table bedizened, excited, and tense.

He felt an urge to revitalize himself, restore himself physically, and patronized the hotel barber with increasing frequency.","Like any lover, Aschenbach wished to please and was bitterly afraid of rejection. He livened up his attire with youthful little touches, he wore jewelry and used cologne, he fussed over his appearance repeatedly during the day and always turned up at dinner well dressed, jittery and anxious.

He felt he had to spruce up and restore his looks. He paid frequent visits to the gossipy hotel coiffeur."
"Er war jung und roh gewesen mit der Zeit und, schlecht beraten von ihr, war er öffentlich gestrauchelt, hatte Mißgriffe getan, sich bloßgestellt, Verstöße gegen Takt und Besonnenheit begangen in Wort und Werk. Aber er hatte die Würde gewonnen, nach welcher, wie er behauptete, jedem großen Talente ein natürlicher Drang und Stachel eingeboren ist, ja, man kann sagen, daß seine ganze Entwicklung ein bewußter und trotziger, alle Hemmungen des Zweifels und der Ironie zurücklassender Aufstieg zur Würde gewesen war.","He had been young and rough with the times, and badly advised by them, he had stumbled publicly, made mistakes, exposed himself, committed offenses against tact and prudence in word and deed. But he had gained the dignity after which, as he maintained, every great talent has an innate urge and thorn, indeed one may say that his whole development was a conscious and defiant, leaving behind all the restraints of doubt and irony, ascent to dignity had been.","In his time he had been young and raw; and misled by his age he had blundered in public. He had stumbled, had exposed himself; both in writing and in talk he had offended against caution and tact. But he had acquired the dignity which, as he insisted, is the innate goad and craving of every great talent; in fact, it could be said that his entire development had been a conscious undeviating progression away from the embarrassments of scepticism and irony, and towards dignity.","Young and green with the times and ill advised by them, he had stumbled in public, made false moves, made a fool of himself, violating tact and good sense in word and deed. Yet he eventually gained the dignity to which, as he maintained, every great talent feels instinctively drawn. One might even say that his entire development consisted in jettisoning the constraints of doubt and irony and making the conscious, defiant ascent to dignity.","He had been young and raw along with the times and, poorly guided by them, had publicly stumbled. He had blundered, embarrassed himself, violated tact and good judgment in both word and work. Nevertheless, he had also achieved the goal of dignity, toward which, in his way of thinking, all great talent possessed an inborn drive and impulse. Indeed you could say his entire development had been a conscious and hard-nosed climb toward dignity, to the ultimate abandonment of any inhibiting skepticism and irony."
"Das Wetter ließ sich am folgenden Tage nicht günstiger an. Landwind ging. Unter fahlem, bedecktem Himmel lag das Meer in stumpfer Ruhe, verschrumpft gleichsam, mit nüchtern nahem Horizont und so weit vom Strande zurückgetreten, daß es mehrere Reihen langer Sandbänke freiließ. Als Aschenbach sein Fenster öffnete, glaubte er den fauligen Geruch der Lagune zu spüren.","The weather was not more favorable the following day. land wind went. Under a sallow, overcast sky the sea lay in a dull calm, shrunken, as it were, with the horizon soberly close, and receded so far from the shore that it left several rows of long sandbanks uncovered. When Aschenbach opened his window, he thought he could smell the foul smell of the lagoon.","The weather did not improve any the following day. A land breeze was blowing. Under a cloudy ashen sky, the sea lay in dull peacefulness; it seemed shrivelled up, with a close dreary horizon, and it had retreated from the beach, baring the long ribs of several sandbanks. As Aschenbach opened his window he thought that he could detect the foul smell of the lagoon.","The weather had not improved the next morning. The wind came from the land. The sea was dull and calm, shrunken almost, under a pale, overcast sky, the horizon blandly close; the sea had retreated so far from the beach that it left several rows of long sandbanks exposed.

Under the pale overcast sky, the sea lay in dull silence, looking almost shrunken, the horizon sobering and close, the tides so far back from the beach that long rows of sandbars had been exposed.

"Tadzio, mit drei oder vier Gespielen, die ihm geblieben waren, bewegte sich zur Rechten vor der Hütte der Seinen, und, eine Decke über den Knieen, etwa in der Mitte zwischen dem Meer und der Reihe der Strandhütten in seinem Liegestuhl ruhend, sah Aschenbach ihm noch einmal zu. Das Spiel, das unbeaufsichtigt war, denn die Frauen mochten mit Reisevorbereitungen beschäftigt sein, schien regellos und artete aus. Jener Stämmige, im Gürtelanzug und mit schwarzem, pomadisiertem Haar, der »Jaschu« gerufen wurde, durch einen Sandwurf ins Gesicht gereizt und geblendet, zwang Tadzio zum Ringkampf, der rasch mit dem Fall des schwächeren Schönen endete. Aber als ob in der Abschiedsstunde das dienende Gefühl des Geringeren sich in grausame Roheit verkehre und für eine lange Sklaverei Rache zu nehmen trachte, ließ der Sieger auch dann noch nicht von dem Unterlegenen ab, sondern drückte, auf seinem Rücken knieend, dessen Gesicht so anhaltend in den Sand, daß Tadzio, ohnedies vom Kampf außer Atem, zu ersticken drohte. Seine Versuche, den Lastenden abzuschütteln, waren krampfhaft, sie unterblieben auf Augenblicke ganz und wiederholten sich nur noch als ein Zucken. Entsetzt wollte Aschenbach zur Rettung aufspringen, als der Gewalttätige endlich sein Opfer freigab. Tadzio, sehr bleich, richtete sich zur Hälfte auf und saß, auf einen Arm gestützt, mehrere Minuten lang unbeweglich, mit verwirrtem Haar und dunkelnden Augen. Dann stand er vollends auf und entfernte sich langsam. Man rief ihn, anfänglich munter, dann bänglich und bittend; er hörte nicht. Der Schwarze, den Reue über seine Ausschreitung sogleich erfaßt haben mochte, holte ihn ein und suchte ihn zu versöhnen. Eine Schulterbewegung wies ihn zurück. Tadzio ging schräg hinunter zum Wasser. Er war barfuß und trug seinen gestreiften Leinenanzug mit roter Schleife.","Tadzio, with three or four playmates who were left to him, moved to the right in front of the hut of his, and, a blanket over his knees, reclining in his lounge chair about halfway between the sea and the row of beach huts, saw Aschenbach to him again. The game, left unsupervised because the women might be busy making arrangements for travel, seemed disorderly and degenerated. The burly man, in a belt suit and with black, pomaded hair, who was called ""Jaschu"", irritated and blinded in the face by a sand throw, forced Tadzio into a wrestling match, which quickly ended with the fall of the weaker handsome man. But as if in the hour of farewell the serving feeling of the inferior had turned into cruel brutality and was trying to take revenge for a long slavery, the victor did not let go of the loser even then, but, kneeling on his back, pressed his face so firmly into the sand so that Tadzio, already out of breath from the fight, threatened to suffocate. His attempts to shake off the burden were spasmodic, they stopped altogether for a few moments and were repeated only as a twitch. Horrified, Aschenbach wanted to jump to the rescue when the violent man finally released his victim. Tadzio, very pale, half sat up and propped himself up on one arm, motionless for several minutes, his hair disheveled and his eyes darkening. Then he got up completely and slowly walked away. He was called, at first cheerfully, then anxiously and pleadingly; he didn't hear. The black man, who must have felt remorse at his excess, caught up with him and tried to reconcile him. A movement of his shoulders rejected him. Tadzio walked diagonally down to the water. He was barefoot and wearing his striped linen suit with a red bow.","Tadzio, with the three or four companions still left, was moving about to the right in front of his family's cabin. And midway between the sea and the row of bathing houses, lying back in his chair with a robe over his knees, Aschenbach looked at him once more. The game, which was not being supervised since the women were probably occupied with preparations for the journey, seemed to have no rules, and it was degenerating. The stocky boy with the sleek black hair who was called Jaschu had been angered and blinded by sand flung in his face. He forced Tadzio into a wrestling match which quickly ended in the fall of the beauty, who was weaker. But as though in the hour of parting the servile feelings of the inferior had turned to merciless brutality and were trying to get vengeance for a long period of slavery, the victor did not let go of the boy underneath, but knelt on his back and pressed his face so persistently into the sand that Tadzio, already breathless from the struggle, was in danger of strangling. His attempts to shake off the weight were fitful; for moments they stopped entirely and were resumed again as mere twitchings. Enraged, Aschenbach was about to spring to the rescue, when the torturer finally released his victim. Tadzio, very pale, raised himself halfway and sat motionless for several minutes, resting on one arm, with rumpled hair and glowering eyes. Then he stood up completely, and moved slowly away. They called him, cheerfully at first, then anxiously and imploringly; he did not listen. The swarthy boy, who seemed to regret his excesses immediately afterwards, caught up with him and tried to placate him. A movement of the shoulder put him at his distance. Tadzio went down obliquely to the water. He was barefoot, and wore his striped linen suit with the red bow.","Tadzio, with the three or four playmates left to him, was moving about on the right in front of the family cabana, and Aschenbach, resting on his chaise longue about midway between the sea and the row of cabanas, a blanket over his knees, was watching him once again. Their play, which went unsupervised, the women being presumably occupied with travel preparations, looked unruly and was getting out of hand. That stocky fellow with the belted linen suit and black, slicked-down hair—the one they addressed as Jasiu—aroused and blinded by a handful of sand thrown in his face, had forced Tadzio into a wrestling match, which ended in the swift defeat of the beautiful yet weaker boy. But now that it was time to part, the underling’s deferential sentiments seemed to have turned to brutal cruelty as he sought revenge for his long enslavement, and the victor, far from releasing his victim, knelt on his back and drove his face so relentlessly into the sand that Tadzio, already breathless from the struggle, appeared in danger of suffocating. His efforts at shaking off the burden of his attacker were convulsive and ceased for moments at a time, recurring only as twitches. Horrified, Aschenbach was about to spring to his aid when the ruffian finally let his quarry free. Tadzio, very pale, raised his body halfway and sat motionless for several minutes, leaning on one arm, hair disheveled and eyes darkening. Then he got to his feet and walked slowly off. The boys called out to him, cheerily at first, then anxiously, imploringly; he did not hear. The dark boy, who must have felt immediate remorse at having gone so far, ran after him and tried to make peace. A heave of the shoulder rebuffed him. Tadzio moved on at an angle towards the water. He was barefoot and wearing the striped linen suit with the red bow.","Tadzio, along with three or four remaining playmates, was running around to the right in front of his family’s hut. Aschenbach sat in a chair approximately halfway between the sea and the row of huts with a blanket over his knees and watched Tadzio one more time. The game was unsupervised (the women were apparently preparing for departure), seemed to have no rules and quickly got out of control. The strapping lad with the belted jumpsuit and the black pomaded hair called “Yashu,” enraged by some blinding sand thrown in his face, challenged Tadzio to a wrestling match. This soon ended with the beautiful but weaker combatant being pinned. Nevertheless, as though in this final hour the servile vassal had been transformed into a terrible brute who now sought revenge for his long subordination, the victorious “Yashu” refused to stop attacking his vanquished foe and instead kept one knee on his back, pressing his face into the sand. Tadzio, who was already out of breath from the fight, was near suffocation. His efforts to shake off the weight on top of him were convulsive, ceasing entirely for moments at a time, to return as mere twitching. Horrified, Aschenbach wanted to leap to the rescue, but just then the bully finally released his victim. Very pale, Tadzio got halfway up and sat motionless for several minutes, leaning on one arm, his hair mussed and his eyes glowering. Then he took to his feet and walked slowly off. His name was called, at first playfully, then apologetically and urgently, but he turned a deaf ear. The dark-haired boy, no doubt overcome with immediate regret at having gone too far, ran after him and tried to patch things up. A shoulder motioned for him to stay back. Tadzio walked diagonally down to the water. He was barefoot and wore his striped linen outfit with the red bow."
"So dachte er, während der Lärm der elektrischen Tram die Ungererstraße daher sich näherte, und einsteigend beschloß er, diesen Abend dem Studium von Karte und Kursbuch zu widmen. Auf der Plattform fiel ihm ein, nach dem Manne im Basthut, dem Genossen dieses immerhin folgereichen Aufenthaltes, Umschau zu halten. Doch wurde ihm dessen Verbleib nicht deutlich, da er weder an seinem vorherigen Standort, noch auf dem weiteren Halteplatz, noch auch im Wagen ausfindig zu machen war.","That's what he thought as the noise of the electric tram approached Ungererstrasse, and as he got on he decided to devote the evening to studying the map and course book. On the platform it occurred to him to look around for the man in the raffia hat, the comrade of what was, after all, a fruitful stay. However, his whereabouts were not clear to him, since he could not be found at his previous location, nor at the further stopping place, nor in the car.","He thought this out while the noise of the electric tram came nearer along the Ungererstrasse; and as he boarded it he decided to devote the evening to the study of maps and time-tables. On the platform it occurred to him to look around for the man in the straw hat, his companion during that most significant time spent waiting at the station. But his whereabouts remained uncertain, as he was not to be seen either at the place where he was formerly standing, or anywhere else in the vicinity of the station, or on the car itself.","Such were his reflections as the clang of the electric tram reached him along the Ungererstrasse, and mounting the platform he decided to spend the evening studying maps and timetables. He thought of looking back to find the man in the bast hat, his companion during what had turned into a fateful wait, but he was unable to determine the man’s whereabouts : he was neither at his previous location nor at the next stop nor in the tram.","Such were his thoughts as the noise from the tram on its wire advanced up Ungererstraße, and upon getting in, he decided to devote that evening to the study of maps and train schedules. On the tram steps, it occurred to him to look around for the man in the raffia hat, his companion during what had certainly been a most momentous wait. The man’s whereabouts, however, remained a mystery, for he was to be found neither in his previous location nor anywhere on the platform nor within the streetcar itself."
"Er verbrachte zwei Stunden auf seinem Zimmer und fuhr am Nachmittag mit dem Vaporetto über die faulriechende Lagune nach Venedig. Er stieg aus bei San Marco, nahm den Tee auf dem Platze und trat dann, seiner hiesigen Tagesordnung gemäß, einen Spaziergang durch die Straßen an. Es war jedoch dieser Gang, der einen völligen Umschwung seiner Stimmung, seiner Entschlüsse herbeiführte.","He spent two hours in his room and in the afternoon took the vaporetto across the foul-smelling lagoon to Venice.

But this stroll brought about a major change in his mood and intentions.","He spent two hours in his room that afternoon before taking the vaporetto across the foul-smelling Lagoon to Venice. He disembarked at San Marco, drank a cup of tea on the Piazza, then set off on a stroll through the streets, as he had done whenever he was there before. However, it was this routine walk that completely changed his mood and his plans."
"Gustav Aschenbach oder von Aschenbach, wie seit seinem fünfzigsten Geburtstag amtlich sein Name lautete, hatte an einem Frühlingsnachmittag des Jahres 19.., das unserem Kontinent monatelang eine so gefahrdrohende Miene zeigte, von seiner Wohnung in der Prinz-Regentenstraße zu München aus, allein einen weiteren Spaziergang unternommen. Überreizt von der schwierigen und gefährlichen, eben jetzt eine höchste Behutsamkeit, Umsicht, Eindringlichkeit und Genauigkeit des Willens erfordernden Arbeit der Vormittagsstunden, hatte der Schriftsteller dem Fortschwingen des produzierenden Triebwerks in seinem Innern, jenem »motus animi continuus«, worin nach Cicero das Wesen der Beredsamkeit besteht, auch nach der Mittagsmahlzeit nicht Einhalt zu tun vermocht und den entlastenden Schlummer nicht gefunden, der ihm, bei zunehmender Abnutzbarkeit seiner Kräfte, einmal untertags so nötig war. So hatte er bald nach dem Tee das Freie gesucht, in der Hoffnung, daß Luft und Bewegung ihn wieder herstellen und ihm zu einem ersprießlichen Abend verhelfen würden.","Gustav Aschenbach, or von Aschenbach, as his official name had been since his fiftieth birthday, had one alone on a spring afternoon in the year 19, which had been showing our continent such a menacing expression for months, from his apartment in the Prinz-Regentenstrasse in Munich took another walk. Overexcited by the difficult and dangerous work of the morning hours, which just now required the greatest caution, prudence, urgency and accuracy of will, the writer had to face the continuing vibration of the productive engine within himself, that ""motus animi continuus"" in which, according to Cicero, the essence of eloquence persists, was not able to stop even after midday meal and did not find the relieving slumber that was so necessary to him once during the day, given the increasing wear and tear of his strength. So soon after tea he had sought the outdoors in the hope that air and exercise would restore him and help him to a fruitful evening.","On a spring afternoon of the year 19—, when our continent lay under such threatening weather for whole months, Gustav Aschenbach, or von Aschenbach as his name read officially after his fiftieth birthday, had left his apartment on the Prinzregentenstrasse in Munich and had gone for a long walk. Overwrought by the trying and precarious work of the forenoon—which had demanded a maximum wariness, prudence, penetration, and rigour of the will—the writer had not been able even after the noon meal to break the impetus of the productive mechanism within him, that motus animi continuus which constitutes, according to Cicero, the foundation of eloquence; and he had not attained the healing sleep which—what with the increasing exhaustion of his strength—he needed in the middle of each day. So he had gone outdoors soon after tea, in the hopes that air and movement would restore him and prepare him for a profitable evening.","Gustav Aschenbach or von Aschenbach, as he had officially been known since his fiftieth birthday, set out alone from his residence in Munich’s Prinzre-gentenstrasse on a spring afternoon in 19.. —a year that for months had shown so ominous a countenance to our continent—with the intention of taking an extended walk. Overwrought from the difficult and dangerous labors of the late morning hours, labors demanding the utmost caution, prudence, tenacity, and precision of will, the writer had even after the midday meal been unable to halt the momentum of the inner mechanism—the motus animi continuus in which, according to Cicero, eloquence resides—and find the refreshing sleep that the growing wear and tear upon his forces had made a daily necessity. And so, shortly after tea he had sought the outdoors in the hope that open air and exercise might revive him and help him to enjoy a fruitful evening.","Gustav Aschenbach, or von Aschenbach, as had been his legal name since his fiftieth birthday, had begun a long solitary walk from his apartment on Munich’s Prinzregentenstraße during a spring afternoon in 19—, a year that had for months glared so menacingly at our European continent. Even after lunch, overstimulated by many morning hours of difficult work, full of pitfalls and especially now demanding the greatest caution, judiciousness, probing insistence and exactitude of will, the writer had been unable to put a halt to the relentlessly running machine within him—that “motus animi continuus” which for Cicero is the essence of eloquence—and had been denied the relief of the nap so increasingly necessary at some point each day with the progressive decline in his stamina. Therefore, not long after tea, he had sought the outdoors, hoping that a little fresh air and exercise might revive him and help him put his evening to worthwhile use."
"Ärztliche Fürsorge hatte den Knaben vom Schulbesuch ausgeschlossen und auf häuslichen Unterricht gedrungen. Einzeln, ohne Kameradschaft war er aufgewachsen und hatte doch zeitig erkennen müssen, daß er einem Geschlecht angehörte, in dem nicht das Talent, wohl aber die physische Basis eine Seltenheit war, deren das Talent zu seiner Erfüllung bedarf,—einem Geschlechte, das früh sein Bestes zu geben pflegt und in dem das Können es selten zu Jahren bringt. Aber sein Lieblingswort war »Durchhalten«,—er sah in seinem Friedrich-Roman nichts anderes als die Apotheose dieses Befehlswortes, das ihm als der Inbegriff-leitend-tätiger Tugend erschien. Auch wünschte er sehnlichst, alt zu werden, denn er hatte von jeher dafür gehalten, daß wahrhaft groß, umfassend, ja wahrhaft ehrenwert nur das Künstlertum zu nennen sei, dem es beschieden war, auf allen Stufen des Menschlichen charakteristisch fruchtbar zu sein.","Medical care had barred the boy from going to school and insisted on home schooling. He had grown up alone, without comradeship, and yet had to recognize early on that he belonged to a race in which talent was not a rarity, but rather the physical basis that talent required to be fulfilled—a race that was early who tends to give his best and in which ability rarely makes it to years. But his favorite word was ""persevere""—in his Friedrich novel he saw nothing other than the apotheosis of this command word, which he saw as the epitome of active, guiding virtue. He also longed fervently to grow old, for he had always believed that the only truly great, comprehensive, indeed truly honorable artistry was that which was destined to be characteristically fruitful at all levels of humanity.","Considerations of ill-health had kept him from attending school as a boy, and had compelled him to receive instruction at home. He had grown up alone, without comrades—and he was forced to realize soon enough that he belonged to a race which often lacked, not talent, but that physical substructure which talent relies on for its fullest fruition: a race accustomed to giving its best early, and seldom extending its faculties over the years. But his favourite phrase was ""carrying through""; in his novel on Frederick he saw the pure apotheosis of this command, which struck him as the essential concept of the virtuous in action and passion. Also, he wished earnestly to grow old, since he had always maintained that the only artistry which can be called truly great, comprehensive, yes even truly admirable, is that which is permitted to bear fruits characteristic of each stage in human development.","Medical concerns had kept the boy out of school and dependent on private tutoring. He had grown up solitary and friendless and must have realized early that he belonged to a species for which talent was less a rarity than physical strength—the strength needed to make something of the talent—a species that tended to make the most of its powers early, seldom developing them into old age. But his motto was Durchhalten, “Persevere,” and he regarded his Frederick-the-Great novel as nothing short of the apotheosis of this command, which he considered the essence of a cardinal virtue: action in the face of suffering. Then, too, he ardently desired to live to old age, for he had always believed that the only artistic gift that can be called truly great, all-encompassing, and, yes, truly praiseworthy is one that has been vouchsafed productivity at all stages of human existence.","Medical considerations had kept the adolescent Aschenbach from attending school and required him to be educated at home. He had grown up in solitude, without companionship, and had been forced to recognize himself early on as belonging to that breed of men who lacked, not talent, but the necessary physical foundation for the utmost development of talent—a breed of men who tend to do their best work when young and whose abilities rarely make it very far along in years. “To persevere through all,” however, had always been his motto. In his Frederick the Great novel he saw nothing less than the apotheosis of this imperative, which for him represented the essence of long-suffering, ever-toiling virtue. Moreover, it was one of his most passionate wishes to grow old, for he had always believed that the only artistic talent that could be deemed truly great, sweeping, indeed truly admirable, was that given the chance to bear characteristic fruit every step of the way throughout a human lifetime."
"Sein Kopf brannte, sein Körper war mit klebrigem Schweiß bedeckt, sein Genick zitterte, ein nicht mehr erträglicher Durst peinigte ihn, er sah sich nach irgendwelcher, nach augenblicklicher Labung um. Vor einem kleinen Gemüseladen kaufte er einige Früchte, Erdbeeren, überreife und weiche Ware und aß im Gehen davon. Ein kleiner Platz, verlassen, verwunschen anmutend, öffnete sich vor ihm, er erkannte ihn, es war hier gewesen, wo er vor Wochen den vereitelten Fluchtplan gefaßt hatte. Auf den Stufen der Zisterne, inmitten des Ortes, ließ er sich niedersinken und lehnte den Kopf an das steinerne Rund. Es war still, Gras wuchs zwischen dem Pflaster. Abfälle lagen umher. Unter den verwitterten, unregelmäßig hohen Häusern in der Runde erschien eines palastartig, mit Spitzbogenfenstern, hinter denen die Leere wohnte, und kleinen Löwenbalkonen. Im Erdgeschoß eines anderen befand sich eine Apotheke. Warme Windstöße brachten zuweilen Karbolgeruch.","His head was burning, his body was covered with sticky sweat, his neck was trembling, he was tormented by an unbearable thirst, he looked around for some sort of immediate refreshment. In front of a small greengrocer's he bought some fruits, strawberries, overripe and soft goods and ate them while walking. A small square, deserted, seemingly enchanted, opened up in front of him, he recognized it, it was here where he had conceived the failed escape plan weeks before. On the steps of the cistern, in the middle of the village, he let himself sink down and leaned his head on the round stone. It was quiet, grass was growing between the pavement. Garbage was lying around. Among the weathered, unevenly tall houses in the round one appeared palatial, with lancet windows behind which dwelt the emptiness and little lion balconies. On the ground floor of another was a pharmacy. Warm gusts of wind sometimes brought the smell of carbolic acid.","His head was on fire, his body was covered with a sticky sweat, his knees trembled. He could no longer endure the thirst that was torturing him, and he looked around for some immediate relief.

He recognized it; here he had made his frustrated plans for flight weeks ago. He let himself sink down on the steps of the cistern in the middle of the square, and laid his head against the stone cylinder. It was quiet; grass was growing up through the pavement; refuse was scattered about. Among the weather-beaten, unusually tall houses surrounding him there was one like a palace, with little lion-covered balconies, and Gothic windows with blank emptiness behind them. On the ground floor of another house was a drug store.

A small deserted square that seemed under a curse opened up before him, and he recognized it : it was there he had formulated his abortive escape plan a few weeks before. He sank down on the steps of the well in the middle of the square, resting his head against its iron rim. All was quiet. There was grass coming up between the cobblestones and litter lying about. Among the weathered buildings of unequal height ringing the square he noticed one resembling a palazzo and having Gothic arch windows with empty space behind them and balconies adorned by lions. There was an apothecary on the ground floor of another, and the smell of carbolic acid wafted over to him on an occasional gust of warm wind.","His head was on fire, his body was covered in feverish sweat, the nape of his neck tingled, a no longer bearable thirst now tortured him, and he looked around for anything that would bring instantaneous relief.

Among the weather-beaten, unevenly tall surrounding houses, one stood out like a palace with its lion-flanked balconies and arched windows, behind which dwelt only emptiness.

"Seit mehreren Jahren schon hatte die indische Cholera eine verstärkte Neigung zur Ausbreitung und Wanderung an den Tag gelegt. Erzeugt aus den warmen Morästen des Ganges-Deltas, aufgestiegen mit dem mephitischen Odem jener üppig-untauglichen, von Menschen gemiedenen Urwelt-und Inselwildnis, in deren Bambusdickichten der Tiger kauert, hatte die Seuche in ganz Hindustan andauernd und ungewöhnlich heftig gewütet, hatte östlich nach China, westlich nach Afghanistan und Persien übergegriffen und, den Hauptstraßen des Karawanenverkehrs folgend, ihre Schrecken bis Astrachan, ja selbst bis Moskau getragen. Aber während Europa zitterte, das Gespenst möchte von dort aus und zu Lande seinen Einzug halten, war es, von syrischen Kauffahrern übers Meer verschleppt, fast gleichzeitig in mehreren Mittelmeerhäfen aufgetaucht, hatte in Toulon und Malaga sein Haupt erhoben, in Palermo und Neapel mehrfach seine Maske gezeigt und schien aus ganz Calabrien und Apulien nicht mehr weichen zu wollen. Der Norden der Halbinsel war verschont geblieben. Jedoch Mitte Mai dieses Jahres fand man zu Venedig an ein und demselben Tage die furchtbaren Vibrionen in den ausgemergelten, schwärzlichen Leichnamen eines Schifferknechtes und einer Grünwarenhändlerin. Die Fälle wurden verheimlicht. Aber nach einer Woche waren es deren zehn, waren es zwanzig, dreißig und zwar in verschiedenen Quartieren. Ein Mann aus der österreichischen Provinz, der sich zu seinem Vergnügen einige Tage in Venedig aufgehalten, starb, in sein Heimatstädtchen zurückgekehrt, unter unzweideutigen Anzeichen, und so kam es, daß die ersten Gerüchte von der Heimsuchung der Lagunenstadt in deutsche Tagesblätter gelangten. Venedigs Obrigkeit ließ antworten, daß die Gesundheitsverhältnisse der Stadt nie besser gewesen seien und traf die notwendigsten Maßregeln zur Bekämpfung. Aber wahrscheinlich waren Nahrungsmittel infiziert worden. Gemüse, Fleisch oder Milch, denn geleugnet und vertuscht, fraß das Sterben in der Enge der Gäßchen um sich, und die vorzeitig eingefallene Sommerhitze, welche das Wasser der Kanäle laulich erwärmte, war der Verbreitung besonders günstig. Ja, es schien, als ob die Seuche eine Neubelebung ihrer Kräfte erfahren, als ob die Tenazität und Fruchtbarkeit ihrer Erreger sich verdoppelt hätte. Fälle der Genesung waren sehr selten; achtzig vom Hundert der Befallenen starben und zwar auf entsetzliche Weise, denn das Übel trat mit äußerster Wildheit auf und zeigte häufig jene gefährlichste Form, welche »die trockene« benannt ist. Hierbei vermochte der Körper das aus den Blutgefäßen massenhaft abgesonderte Wasser nicht einmal auszutreiben. Binnen wenigen Stunden verdorrte der Kranke und erstickte am pechartig zähe gewordenen Blut unter Krämpfen und heiseren Klagen. Wohl ihm, wenn, was zuweilen geschah, der Ausbruch nach leichtem Übelbefinden in Gestalt einer tiefen Ohnmacht erfolgte, aus der er nicht mehr oder kaum noch erwachte. Anfang Juni füllten sich in der Stille die Isolierbaracken des Ospedale civico, in den beiden Waisenhäusern begann es an Platz zu mangeln, und ein schauerlich reger Verkehr herrschte zwischen dem Kai der neuen Fundamente und San Michele, der Friedhofsinsel. Aber die Furcht vor allgemeiner Schädigung, die Rücksicht auf die kürzlich eröffnete Gemäldeausstellung in den öffentlichen Gärten, auf die gewaltigen Ausfälle, von denen im Falle der Panik und des Verrufes die Hotels, die Geschäfte, das ganze vielfältige Fremdengewerbe bedroht waren, zeigte sich mächtiger in der Stadt als Wahrheitsliebe und Achtung vor internationalen Abmachungen; sie vermochte die Behörde, ihre Politik des Verschweigens und des Ableugnens hartnäckig aufrecht zu erhalten. Der oberste Medizinalbeamte Venedigs, ein verdienter Mann, war entrüstet von seinem Posten zurückgetreten und unter der Hand durch eine gefügigere Persönlichkeit ersetzt worden. Das Volk wußte das; und die Korruption der Oberen zusammen mit der herrschenden Unsicherheit, dem Ausnahmezustand, in welchen der umgehende Tod die Stadt versetzte, brachte eine gewisse Entsittlichung der unteren Schichten hervor, eine Ermutigung lichtscheuer und antisozialer Triebe, die sich in Unmäßigkeit, Schamlosigkeit und wachsender Kriminalität bekundete. Gegen die Regel bemerkte man abends viele Betrunkene; bösartiges Gesindel machte, so hieß es, nachts die Straßen unsicher; räuberische Anfälle und selbst Mordtaten wiederholten sich, denn schon zweimal hatte sich erwiesen, daß angeblich der Seuche zum Opfer gefallene Personen vielmehr von ihren eigenen Anverwandten mit Gift aus dem Leben geräumt worden waren; und die gewerbsmäßige Liederlichkeit nahm aufdringliche und ausschweifende Formen an, wie sie sonst hier nicht bekannt und nur im Süden des Landes und im Orient zu Hause gewesen waren.","For several years, Indian cholera had shown an increased tendency to spread and migrate. Generated from the warm morass of the Ganges delta, rising with the Mephite breath of that luxuriant, useless, primeval world and island wilderness avoided by humans, in whose bamboo thickets the tiger crouches, the plague had raged continuously and unusually violently throughout Hindustan, had spread eastward China, encroached westward into Afghanistan and Persia and, following the main roads of caravan traffic, carried their horrors to Astrakhan and even to Moscow. But while Europe trembled, the specter would like to make its entry from there and by land, it had appeared almost simultaneously in several Mediterranean ports, had been dragged across the sea by Syrian merchantmen, had raised its head in Toulon and Malaga, and repeatedly in Palermo and Naples Mask shown and seemed not to want to leave the whole of Calabria and Apulia. The north of the peninsula was spared. However, in the middle of May of this year, on the same day in Venice, the terrible vibrios were found in the emaciated, blackened corpses of a ship's boy and a woman selling green goods. The cases were kept secret. But after a week there were ten, twenty, thirty in different quarters. A man from the Austrian provinces, who had spent a few days in Venice for his pleasure, died on his return to his home town, with unequivocal signs, and so it was that the first rumors of the visitation of the lagoon city made their way into German newspapers. Venice's authorities answered that the health of the city had never been better and took the most necessary measures to combat it. But food had probably been infected. Vegetables, meat or milk, because denied and hushed up, dying ate around in the narrow streets, and the premature summer heat, which lukewarmly warmed the water in the canals, was particularly favorable to the spread. Yes, it seemed as if the plague experienced a revival of its powers, as if the tenacity and fertility of its agents had doubled. Cases of recovery were very rare; Eighty per hundred of those afflicted died, and horribly so, for the affliction arose with the utmost ferocity, and often exhibited that most dangerous form which is called ""the dry one."" The body was not even able to expel the water that was excreted in large quantities from the blood vessels. Within a few hours the patient withered away and choked on the blood, which had become thick with pitch, with cramps and hoarse complaints. Good for him when, as sometimes happened, the outburst after feeling slightly ill took the form of a deep faint, from which he hardly or never woke up. At the beginning of June the isolation barracks of the Ospedale civico were quietly filling up, there was beginning to be a lack of space in the two orphanages, and there was horribly lively traffic between the quay of the new foundations and San Michele, the cemetery island. But the fear of general damage, the concern for the recently opened exhibition of paintings in the public gardens, for the massive losses which threatened the hotels, shops, and the whole diverse tourist trade in the event of panic and disrepute, showed themselves more powerfully of the city as a love of truth and respect for international agreements; she was able to stubbornly uphold the policy of silence and denial. The chief medical officer of Venice, a man of merit, had indignantly resigned his post and been secretly replaced by a more docile personality. The people knew that; and the corruption of the upper classes, together with the prevailing insecurity, the state of emergency in which impending death throws the city, produced a certain demoralization of the lower classes, an encouragement of unsolicited and antisocial instincts, which manifested itself in intemperance, shamelessness, and growing criminality. Contrary to the rule, many drunks were noticed in the evenings; malicious rabble, it was said, made the streets unsafe at night; attacks of robbery and even acts of murder were repeated, for it had already been shown twice that people who had allegedly fallen victim to the plague had actually been poisoned by their own relatives; and the commercial debauchery took on obtrusive and extravagant forms that were otherwise unknown here and were only at home in the south of the country and in the Orient.","For several years now Indian cholera had shown a heightened tendency to spread and migrate. Hatched in the warm swamps of the Ganges delta, rising with the noxious breath of that luxuriant, unfit primitive world and island wilderness which is shunned by humans and where the tiger crouches in the bamboo thickets, the plague had raged continuously and with unusual strength in Hindustan, had reached eastwards to China, westwards to Afghanistan and Persia, and following the chief caravan routes, had carried its terrors to Astrachan, and even to Moscow. But while Europe was trembling lest the spectre continue its advance from there across the country, it had been transported over the sea by Syrian merchantmen, and had turned up almost simultaneously in several Mediterranean ports, had raised its head in Toulon and Malaga, had showed its mask several times in Palermo and Naples, and seemed permanently entrenched through Calabria and Apulia. The north of the peninsula had been spared. Yet in the middle of this May in Venice the frightful vibrions were found on one and the same day in the blackish wasted bodies of a cabin boy and a woman who sold greengroceries. The cases were kept secret. But within a week there were ten, twenty, thirty more, and in various sections. A man from the Austrian provinces who had made a pleasure trip to Venice for a few days, returned to his home town and died with unmistakable symptoms—and that is how the first reports of the pestilence in the lagoon city got into the German newspapers. The Venetian authorities answered that the city's health conditions had never been better, and took the most necessary preventive measures. But probably the food supply had been infected. Denied and glossed over, death was eating its way along the narrow streets, and its dissemination was especially favoured by the premature summer heat which made the water of the canals lukewarm. Yes, it seemed as though the plague had got renewed strength, as though the tenacity and fruitfulness of its stimuli had doubled. Cases of recovery were rare. Out of a hundred attacks, eighty were fatal, and in the most horrible manner. For the plague moved with utter savagery, and often showed that most dangerous form, which is called ""the drying."" Water from the blood vessels collected in pockets, and the blood was unable to carry this off. Within a few hours the victim was parched, his blood became as thick as glue, and he stifled amid cramps and hoarse groans. Lucky for him if, as sometimes happened, the attack took the form of a light discomfiture followed by a profound coma from which he seldom or never awakened. At the beginning of June the pesthouse of the Ospedale Civico had quietly filled; there was not much room left in the two orphan asylums, and a frightfully active commerce was kept up between the wharf of the Fondamenta Nuove and San Michele, the burial island. But there was the fear of a general drop in prosperity. The recently opened art exhibit in the public gardens was to be considered, along with the heavy losses which in case of panic or unfavourable rumours, would threaten business, the hotels, the entire elaborate system for exploiting foreigners—and as these considerations evidently carried more weight than love of truth or respect for international agreements, the city authorities upheld obstinately their policy of silence and denial. The chief health officer had resigned from his post in indignation, and been promptly replaced by a more tractable personality. The people knew this; and the corruption of their superiors, together with the predominating insecurity, the exceptional condition into which the prevalence of death had plunged the city, induced a certain demoralization of the lower classes, encouraging shady and anti-social impulses which manifested themselves in licence, profligacy, and a rising crime wave. Contrary to custom, many drunkards were seen in the evenings; it was said that at night nasty mobs made the streets unsafe. Burglaries and even murders became frequent, for it had already been proved on two occasions that persons who had presumably fallen victim to the plague had in reality been dispatched with poison by their own relatives. And professional debauchery assumed abnormal and obtrusive proportions such as had never been known here before, and to an extent which is usually found only in the southern parts of the country and in the Orient.","For several years now Indian cholera had displayed a growing tendency to spread and migrate. Emanating from the humid marshes of the Ganges Delta, rising with the mephitic exhalations of that lush, uninhabitable, primordial island jungle shunned by man, where tigers crouch in bamboo thickets, the epidemic had long raged with unwonted virulence through Hindustan, then moved eastward to China, westward to Afghanistan and Persia, and, following the main caravan routes, borne its horrors as far as Astrakhan and even Moscow. But while Europe quaked at the thought of the specter invading from there by land, it had been transported by sea in the ships of Syrian merchants and shown up in several Mediterranean ports simultaneously: it had raised its head in Toulon and Málaga, donned its mask repeatedly in Palermo and Naples, and seemed to have taken up permanent residence throughout Calabria and Apulia. The northern part of the peninsula had been spared. Then in mid-May of this year, on one and the same day, the dread vibrios had been discovered in the blackened, wasted corpses of a ship’s boy and a grocer woman in Venice. The cases were kept secret. Within a week, however, there were ten of them, then twenty, thirty, and in different districts to boot. A man from a provincial town in Austria, returning home from a few days’ holiday in Venice, died with unmistakable symptoms, and the first rumors of an outbreak in the city on the lagoon made their way into the German press. The Venetian authorities issued a statement to the effect that health conditions had never been better, then took the most essential precautions against the disease. But some food must have been contaminated—vegetables, meat, or milk—because, denied or concealed as it was, death ate a path through the narrow streets, and the premature summer heat, which had warmed the water in the canals, was particularly conducive to its spread. The epidemic even seemed to be undergoing a revitalization; the tenacity and fertility of its pathogens appeared to have redoubled. Recovery was rare: eighty out of a hundred of those infected died, and died a horrible death, because the disease would strike with the utmost ferocity, often taking its most dangerous form, the “dry” form, as it was called. In such cases the body was unable to expel the massive amounts of water secreted by the blood vessels, and within a few hours the patient would shrivel up and choke—convulsed and groaning hoarsely—on his own blood, now thick as pitch. He was fortunate if, as occasionally happened, after a slight indisposition he fell into a deep coma, from which he seldom if ever awoke. By early June the isolation wards of the Ospedale Civile had quietly begun to fill up; room in the two orphanages became scarce, and there was an eerily brisk traffic between the quay of the Fondamente Nuove and San Michele, the cemetery island. But fear of the overall damage that would be done—concern over the recently opened art exhibition in the Public Gardens and the tremendous losses with which the hotels, the shops, the entire, multifaceted tourist trade would be threatened in case of panic and loss of confidence—proved stronger in the city than the love of truth and respect for international covenants: it made the authorities stick stubbornly to their policy of secrecy and denial. The chief medical officer of Venice, a man of outstanding merit, had resigned from his post in high dudgeon and been quietly replaced by a more pliable individual. The populace knew all this, and corruption in high places together with the prevailing insecurity and the state of emergency into which death stalking the streets had plunged the city led to a certain degeneracy among the lower classes, the encouragement of dark, antisocial impulses that made itself felt in self-indulgence, debauchery, and growing criminality. There was an unusually high number of drunkards abroad in the evening; vicious bands of rabble were said to make the streets unsafe at night; muggings were not uncommon and even murders, for it had been shown that on two occasions people who had allegedly fallen victim to the epidemic had in fact been done in, poisoned, by their relatives; and prostitution now assumed blatant and dissolute forms hitherto unknown here, at home only in the south of the country and the Orient.","For many years, Asiatic cholera had been both on the increase and on the move. Originating in the humid swamps of the Ganges delta, carried by the mephitic breath of that haughty and untameable primeval island jungle shunned by man, where the tiger crouches in his bamboo thicket, the epidemic had raged long and with unusual intensity throughout Hindustan, spreading east into China and west into Afghanistan and Persia. There, following the main caravan routes, it had brought its horrors as far as Astrakhan, even as far as Moscow. But while all of Europe watched with fearful eyes lest this specter continue its invasion by land, Syrian traders were already carrying it by sea. It appeared almost simultaneously in several Mediterranean ports, raising its head in Toulon and Málaga, showing its face in Palermo and Naples and digging in its heels throughout Calibri and Apulia. The northern half of the peninsula had been spared. But in mid-May of this year, the terrible vibrio bacilli had been discovered twice on the same day, in the emaciated, blackened corpses of a ship’s hand and a fruit-and-vegetable girl. Their cases were covered up. But within a week, there were ten, twenty, thirty of them, and worse still in various neighborhoods. A vacationer from provincial Austria who had spent several days in Venice died upon returning home, his symptoms unmistakable. That was why the first rumors of an outbreak in the Lagoon city had made their way into German newspapers. Venetian officials declared in response that health conditions in the city had never been better and ordered the most necessary precautionary measures. But apparently something in the food supply had been contaminated—vegetables, meat or milk—for, under the official silence of a cover-up, death had begun to eat its way out amidst the narrow alleyways. The premature summer heat, which raised the canal water to lukewarm temperatures, had proven especially conducive to spreading the disease, and it seemed as though the epidemic had in fact been reinvigorated, as if its bacteria had been made doubly tenacious and fertile. Instances of recovery were few. Eighty out of every hundred victims died, and indeed in terrible fashion, for the disease attacked with extreme ferocity, often in its most deadly form, known as the “dry type.” It left the body unable to evacuate the massive amounts of fluid sucked from the circulatory system, so that within a few hours, its victims became dehydrated, screaming in pain with cramps, and ultimately suffocated, their blood as thick as pitch. They could count themselves lucky if, as sometimes happened, they only felt slightly ill before the actual outbreak, lapsing into a coma from which they never or only very briefly awoke. By the beginning of June, the quarantine wards of the Ospedale Civile were quietly filling up, both orphanages had begun to run out of space, and traffic was becoming horrifically constant between the quay at the Fundamente Nuove and San Michele, the cemetery island. Nonetheless, fear about general detriment to the city, concern for the recently opened art exhibition in the public gardens and the serious losses facing hotels, shops and the whole diverse tourist trade, should people panic and word get out, had outweighed the city’s love of truth and respect for international treaties. The stubborn authorities were thus able to maintain their policies of silence and denial. Venice’s senior health official, a man of many years’ service, had resigned his post in indignation and had been quietly replaced by a more easily manipulated person. The public knew about it, and the corruption of their leaders, along with the prevalent uncertainty of the emergency situation in which the string of deaths had placed the city, had decidedly weakened moral standards among the lower classes, encouraging their darker, antisocial impulses. This had led to intemperance, licentiousness and increasing contempt for law and order. An unusual number of drunks could be seen every evening; vicious riffraff, it was said, had made the streets unsafe at night; and there were a rash of muggings and even murders, for twice already it had turned out that supposed victims of the epidemic had actually been dispatched with poison by their own relatives. Moreover commercial vice had taken on obtrusive and excessive forms that was previously unknown in the area, being usually found only in the Italian South and the Orient."

"Schmuck, der in der Tat kaum schätzbar war und aus Ohrgehängen, sowie","Jewelery which was in fact of little value and made of drop earrings, as well","Except that her jewellery added something fantastically lavish to her appearance; indeed, it was almost priceless, and consisted of ear pendants and a very long triple chain of softly glowing pearls, as large as cherries.","The only aspect of her appearance evincing a certain fanciful sense of luxury was the jewelry, which was in fact nearly worthless and consisted of earrings plus a very long triple strand of gently shimmering pearls the size of cherries.","The only element of the extraordinary or the luxurious in her appearance was her jewelry, a pair of dangling earrings and three very long strands of gently shimmering pearls, as big as cherries, all of which were literally priceless."
"In seinen Mantel geschlossen, ein Buch im Schoße, ruhte der Reisende, und die Stunden verrannen ihm unversehens. Es hatte zu regnen aufgehört; man entfernte das leinene Dach. Der Horizont war vollkommen. Unter der breiten Kuppel des Himmels dehnte sich rings die ungeheure Scheibe des öden Meeres; aber im leeren, ungegliederten Raume fehlt unserem Sinn auch das Maß der Zeit, und wir dämmern im Ungemessenen. Schattenhaft sonderbare Gestalten, der greise Geck, der Ziegenbart aus dem Schiffsinnern, gingen mit unbestimmten Gebärden, mit verwirrten Traumworten durch den Geist des Ruhenden, und er schlief ein.","Wrapped up in his cloak, a book in his lap, the traveler rested, and the hours passed by unexpectedly. It had stopped raining; the linen roof was removed. The horizon was perfect. Beneath the broad dome of heaven stretched round the vast disc of the barren sea; but in empty, unstructured space, our sense also lacks the measure of time, and we drowse in the unmeasured. Strange shadowy figures, the old fop, the goatee from inside the ship, walked through the mind of the resting man with indefinite gestures, with confused dream words, and he fell asleep.","Bundled up in his coat, a book in his lap, the traveller rested, and the hours passed unnoticed. It stopped raining; the canvas awning was removed. The horizon was unbroken. The sea, empty, like an enormous disk, lay stretched under the curve of the sky. But in empty inarticulate space our senses lose also the dimensions of time, and we slip into the incommensurate. As he rested, strange shadowy figures, the old dandy, the goatee from the inside cabin, passed through his mind, with vague gestures, muddled dream-words—and he was asleep.","Wrapped in his coat, a book in his lap, the traveler took his ease, the hours slipping by unnoticed. The rain had ceased; the awning been taken down. The horizon was now visible in its entirety. The vast disk of the barren sea stretched out beneath the turbid dome of the sky. But in empty, unarticulated space our senses lose the capacity to articulate time as well, and we sink into the immeasurable. Strange, shadowy figures—the superannuated dandy, the goateed purser from deep in the hold—passed through his quiescent mind with vague gestures and jumbled dreamlike utterances, and he fell asleep.","Wrapped in an overcoat, with a book in his lap, the traveler relaxed, not noticing the hours that passed. It had stopped raining, and the canvas awning was folded back up. The horizon was absolute and infinite. Under the gloomy dome of the sky an eerily immense surface of desolate sea stretched in every direction. When space is empty and undivided, we have no measure of time either and begin to lose ourselves in the sheer infinity. Strange shadowy figures, the old fop and the goateed man from the ship’s interior, passed through the resting Aschenbach’s mind, indistinctly gesturing and speaking some scrambled dream language. He fell asleep."
"Das war richtig; Aschenbach erinnerte sich. Er schwieg. Aber die schroffe, überhebliche, einem Fremden gegenüber so wenig landesübliche Art des Menschen schien unleidlich. Er sagte:","That was right; Aschenbach remembered. He stayed silent. But the brusque, arrogant manner of the man, so unusual when dealing with a stranger, seemed intolerable. He said:","That was so; Aschenbach remembered. He was silent. But the fellow's harsh, presumptuous manner, so unusual towards a foreigner here, seemed unbearable. He said: ""That is my affair.","That was so, Aschenbach remembered. He said nothing, but the gruff, preemptory manner, so unlike the treatment foreigners usually receive from the natives, he found disagreeable. “That is my business,” he said.","That was true, as Aschenbach now recalled. He fell silent. Nonetheless, the brusque arrogance the man displayed toward his foreign guest, so unlike Italy, struck him as intolerable. He said:"
"Seiten, quer über die Insel zum Strande läuft.","sides, runs across the island to the beach.","He gave instructions to have his luggage taken to the beach hotel, and followed the cart through the avenue, the white-blossomed avenue which, lined on both sides with taverns, shops, and boarding houses, runs across the island to the shore.","He gave instructions for his luggage to be taken to the Hôtel des Bains and followed the cart along the avenue, the white-blossoming tree-lined avenue which, flanked by taverns, bazaars, and boardinghouses, ran straight across the island to the beach.","He instructed the man to take his luggage to the beach hotel, then followed the cart down the avenue, that white-blossomed avenue lined on both sides with taverns, bazaars and pensioni that runs straight across the island to the beach."

"Ich will also bleiben, dachte Aschenbach. Wo wäre es besser? Und die Hände im Schoß gefaltet, ließ er seine Augen sich in den Weiten des Meeres verlieren, seinen Blick entgleiten, verschwimmen, sich brechen im eintönigen Dunst der Raumeswüste. Er liebte das Meer aus tiefen Gründen: aus dem Ruheverlangen des schwer arbeitenden Künstlers, der von der anspruchsvollen Vielgestalt der Erscheinungen an der Brust des Einfachen, Ungeheueren sich zu bergen begehrt; aus einem verbotenen, seiner Aufgabe gerade entgegengesetzten und eben darum verführerischen Hange zum Ungegliederten, Maßlosen, Ewigen, zum Nichts. Am Vollkommenen zu ruhen, ist die Sehnsucht dessen, der sich um das Vortreffliche müht; und ist nicht das Nichts eine Form des Vollkommenen? Wie er nun aber so tief ins Leere träumte, ward plötzlich die Horizontale des Ufersaumes von einer menschlichen Gestalt überschnitten, und als er seinen Blick aus dem Unbegrenzten einholte und sammelte, da war es der schöne Knabe, der von links kommend vor ihm im Sande vorüberging. Er ging barfuß, zum Waten bereit, die schlanken Beine bis über die Knie entblößt, langsam, aber so leicht und stolz, als sei er ohne Schuhwerk sich zu bewegen ganz gewöhnt, und schaute sich nach den querstehenden Hütten um. Kaum aber hatte er die russische Familie bemerkt, die dort in dankbarer Eintracht ihr Wesen trieb, als ein Unwetter zorniger Verachtung sein Gesicht überzog. Seine Stirn verfinsterte sich, sein Mund ward emporgehoben, von den Lippen nach einer Seite ging ein erbittertes Zerren, daß die Wange zerriß, und seine Brauen waren so schwer gerunzelt, daß unter ihrem Druck die Augen eingesunken schienen und böse und dunkel darunter hervor die Sprache des Hasses führten. Er blickte zu Boden, blickte noch einmal drohend zurück, tat dann mit der Schulter eine heftig wegwerfende Bewegung und ließ die Feinde im Rücken.","So I want to stay, thought Aschenbach. where would be better And with his hands folded in his lap, he let his eyes lose themselves in the vastness of the sea, his gaze slipping away, becoming blurred, broken in the monotonous haze of the spatial desert. He loved the sea for deep reasons: from the longing for rest of the hard-working artist who longs to hide from the demanding multiplicity of appearances on the breast of the simple, monstrous; out of a forbidden inclination to the unstructured, limitless, eternal, to nothingness, which is exactly the opposite of his task and for that very reason is seductive. To rest on the perfect is the longing of the one who strives for the excellent; and is not nothingness a form of perfection? But as he was dreaming so far into emptiness, the horizontal line of the shoreline was suddenly intersected by a human form, and when he caught his gaze from the limitless and collected it, it was the handsome boy, coming from the left, who passed in front of him in the sand . He walked barefoot, ready to wade, his slender legs bared above his knees, slowly but so lightly and proudly, as if he were quite accustomed to moving without shoes, and looked around at the huts across the way. But he had scarcely noticed the Russian family going about their business there in grateful unity, when a storm of angry contempt covered his face. His forehead darkened, his mouth lifted up, a bitter tug came from his lips to one side, tearing his cheek, and his brows were so heavily wrinkled that his eyes seemed sunken under their pressure, and the language emanated evil and dark from beneath of hate. He looked down, looked back menacingly, then made a violent shrugging motion with his shoulder, leaving the enemy behind.","""Yes, I shall stay,"" Aschenbach thought. ""Where would things be better?"" And his hands folded in his lap, he let his eyes lose themselves in the expanses of the sea, his gaze gliding, swimming, and failing in the monotone mist of the wilderness of space. He loved the ocean for deep-seated reasons: because of that yearning for rest, when the hard-pressed artist hungers to shut out the exacting multiplicities of experience and hide himself on the breast of the simple, the vast; and because of a forbidden hankering—seductive, by virtue of its being directly opposed to his obligations—after the incommunicable, the incommensurate, the eternal, the non-existent. To be at rest in the face of perfection is the hunger of everyone who is aiming at excellence; and what is the non-existent but a form of perfection? But now, just as his dreams were so far out in vacancy, suddenly the horizontal fringe of the sea was broken by a human figure; and as he brought his eyes back from the unbounded, and focussed them, it was the lovely boy who was there, coming from the left and passing him on the sand. He was barefooted, ready for wading, his slender legs exposed above the knees; he walked slowly, but as lightly and proudly as though it were the customary thing for him to move about without shoes; and he was looking around him towards the line of bathing houses opposite. But as soon as he had noticed the Russian family, occupied with their own harmony and contentment, a cloud of scorn and detestation passed over his face. His brow darkened, his mouth was compressed, he gave his lips an embittered twist to one side so that the cheek was distorted, and the forehead became so heavily furrowed that the eyes seemed sunken beneath its pressure: malicious and glowering, they spoke the language of hate. He looked down, looked back once more threateningly, then with his shoulder made an abrupt gesture of disdain and dismissal, and left the enemy behind him.","“I shall stay, then,” Aschenbach thought. “What better place could there be?” And folding his hands in his lap, he let his eyes run over the sea’s great expanse and set his gaze adrift till it blurred and broke in the monotonous mist of barren space. He loved the sea and for deep-seated reasons: the hardworking artist’s need for repose, the desire to take shelter from the demanding diversity of phenomena in the bosom of boundless simplicity, a propensity—proscribed and diametrically opposed to his mission in life and for that very reason seductive—a propensity for the unarticulated, the immoderate, the eternal, for nothingness. To repose in perfection is the desire of all those who strive for excellence, and is not nothingness a form of perfection? But as he dreamt his way deep into the void, the horizontal shoreline was suddenly intersected by a human form and, summoning his gaze back from the infinite and bringing it into focus, he saw none other than the beautiful boy coming from the left, walking past him in the sand. He was barefoot in preparation for wading, his slender legs exposed to above the knee, and while his gait was slow it was as light and proud as if he were quite accustomed to going about shoeless. He looked over at the cabanas in the perpendicular row, but no sooner did he spy the Russian family going about its business in cheerful harmony than a storm cloud of angry disdain came over his face: the forehead wrinkled into a dark frown; the mouth rose up, pulling the lips to one side in a bitter grimace that rent the cheek; the brows grew so deeply furrowed that the eyes seemed to have sunk under the pressure, glowering out from beneath them, speaking the language of hate. He looked down, looked back again ominously, then thrust one shoulder forward in a show of repulsion and rebuff, and left his enemies behind.","I’ll stay then, Aschenbach decided. Where could it be better? And with his hands folded in his lap, his eyes drifted over the expanse of the sea, his gaze slipping away, blurring and ultimately disintegrating in the monotone haze of desolate space. He had a profoundly motivated love of the sea. As an artist, burdened by an artist’s intense labors, he needed rest and longed to turn away from the taxing multiplicity of the external world, to bury his face in the breast of something simple and immense. At the same time, personally, he also felt a forbidden attraction—seductive precisely because it so directly contradicted his life’s mission—toward everything unstructured, excessive and endless, an attraction to nothingness. Every overachiever’s dream is the stasis of perfection. And is not nothingness a form of perfection? But as Aschenbach sat dreaming into the void, a human figure suddenly intersected with the horizontal of the shore’s edge. When he withdrew his eyes from the limitless distance and refocused them, there to the left the beautiful young boy passed before him in the sand. His pants were rolled up to his knees for wading, and his thin legs were exposed. He walked by slowly, but with graceful pride, as though quite accustomed to going around barefoot, staring over at the perpendicular row of huts. Yet hardly had he noticed the Russian family gratefully and peaceably going about their business, than a storm cloud of angry contempt passed across his face. His expression darkened, he grimaced, his mouth tensed, his lips bitterly curled to one side so that a wrinkle ran through his cheek, and his brows furrowed deeply enough for his eyes to appear sunken beneath their weight. They were dark and malevolent, speaking the language of hatred. He looked at the ground, then glanced back again menacingly, before an emphatically dismissive gesture of rejection with his shoulders ended the matter, and he turned his back upon his enemies."
"Leise schmeichelnd bedauerte er den Zwischenfall, nannte ihn äußerst peinlich für ihn und das Institut, billigte aber mit Überzeugung Aschenbachs Entschluß, das Gepäckstück hier zu erwarten. Freilich sei sein Zimmer vergeben, ein anderes jedoch, nicht schlechter, sogleich zur Verfügung. »Pas de chance, monsieur«, sagte der schweizerische Liftführer lächelnd, als man hinaufglitt. Und so wurde der Flüchtling wieder einquartiert, in einem Zimmer, das dem vorigen nach Lage und Einrichtung fast vollkommen glich.","Softly cajoling, he regretted the incident, called it extremely embarrassing for himself and the institute, but wholeheartedly approved of Aschenbach's decision to wait for the piece of luggage here. Of course his room was taken, but another one, no worse, was immediately available. ""Pas de chance, monsieur,"" said the Swiss lift operator with a smile as you glided up. And so the fugitive was billeted again in a room that was almost exactly the same as the previous one in terms of location and furnishings.","He ingratiatingly regretted the episode, spoke of it as highly painful to him and the establishment, but firmly approved of Aschenbach's decision to wait here for the baggage. Of course his room had been given up, but there was another one, just as good, which he could occupy immediately. "" Pas de chance, Monsieur,"" the Swiss elevator boy smiled as they were ascending. And so the fugitive was established again, in a room almost identical to the other in its location and furnishings.","He deplored the incident in his soft, wheedling way, calling it extremely awkward for him and the establishment, but unconditionally condoned Aschenbach’s decision to await the trunk there. His room had of course been occupied, but another, equally suitable, would be ready immediately. “Pas de chance, monsieur,” said the Swiss lift attendant with a smile as they rode up. And thus the fugitive was lodged once more, and in a room all but identical in situation and furnishing.","In soft-spoken sycophantic words he expressed his regret over the incident, calling it extremely embarrassing both for himself and his establishment, although he emphatically endorsed Aschenbach’s decision to remain there to await his luggage. His room had admittedly been given away, but another, just as good, was at his immediate disposal. “Pas de chance, monsieur,” said the Swiss elevator boy with a smile as they were swept upstairs. Thus the refugee was reinstalled in the hotel, in a room whose location and furnishings were almost identical to his earlier one."
