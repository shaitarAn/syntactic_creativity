"Sie betete viel; aber fast noch mehr überwachte sie, sooft sie bei Besinnung war, ihren Zustand, fühlte selbst ihren Puls, maß ihr Fieber, bekämpfte ihren Husten … Der Puls aber ging schlecht, das Fieber stieg desto höher, nachdem es ein wenig gefallen war und warf sie aus Schüttelfrösten in hitzige Delirien, der Husten, der mit inneren Schmerzen verbunden war und blutigen Auswurf zutage förderte, nahm zu, und Atemnot ängstigte sie. Das alles aber kam daher, daß jetzt nicht mehr nur ein Lappen der rechten Lunge, sondern die ganze rechte Lunge in Mitleidenschaft gezogen war, ja, daß, wenn nicht alles täuschte, auch schon an der linken Seite Spuren des Vorganges bemerkbar waren, den Doktor Langhals, indem er seine Fingernägel besah, »Hepatisation« nannte und über den Doktor Grabow sich lieber gar nicht weiter ausließ … Das Fieber zehrte unablässig.

But the pulse went bad, the fever rose the higher after it had fallen a little, and threw her up from chills to hot delirium, the coughing associated with internal pains and producing bloody sputum increased, and shortness of breath frightened her. But all of this was due to the fact that not just one lobe of the right lung was affected, but the entire right lung, yes, if you were not mistaken, traces of the process were also noticeable on the left side, the doctor Long-necked by examining his fingernails, calling them ""hepatization"" and preferring not to say anything more about Doctor Grabow ... The fever was constantly consuming. The stomach began to fail. Unstoppable, with tenacious slowness, the decline of strength progressed.","She prayed a great deal; but she spent even more of her conscious hours watching over her condition, feeling her pulse, measuring her fever, fighting off her cough. But her pulse was not good; her fever might go down, only to rise higher still, propelling her from chills into hectic delirium; her cough grew worse, and with each coughing fit there was more bloody mucus and a sharper pain deep inside; her shortness of breath alarmed her. And all because it was no longer just one lobe of her right lung, but her whole right lung that was infected ; indeed, if the doctors were not badly mistaken, the left side showed distinct signs of a process that Dr. Langhals—while gazing at his fingernails—called “hepatization” and about which Dr. Grabow preferred to say nothing whatever. The fever gnawed away at her unrelentingly. Her digestion began to fail. With stubborn slowness, her energies continued to wane.","She prayed much; but almost more she watched, as often as she was conscious, over her own condition: felt her pulse, took her temperature, and fought her cough. But the pulse was poor, the temperature mounted after falling a little, and she passed from chills to fever and delirium; her cough in- creased, bringing up a blood-impregnated mucous, and she was alarmed by the difficulty she had in breathing.

"Um fünf Uhr konnte der Kampf nicht mehr furchtbarer werden.

"Die Geschäfte hatten nach dem Tode des Konsuls ihren ununterbrochenen und soliden Gang genommen. Aber bald wurde bemerkbar, daß, seitdem Thomas Buddenbrook die Zügel in Händen hielt, ein genialerer, ein frischerer und unternehmenderer Geist den Betrieb beherrschte. Hie und da ward etwas gewagt, hie und da ward der Kredit des Hauses, der unter dem früheren régime eigentlich bloß ein Begriff, eine Theorie, ein Luxus gewesen war, mit Selbstbewußtsein angespannt und ausgenützt … Die Herren an der Börse nickten einander zu. »Buddenbrook will mit avec Geld verdienen«, sagten sie. Aber sie fanden es doch ganz gut, daß Thomas den ehrenfesten Herrn Friedrich Wilhelm Marcus wie eine Bleikugel am Fuße hinter sich drein zu ziehen hatte.

Er strich mit zwei Fingern sorgsam über seinen Schnurrbart, rückte mit peinlicher Ordnungsliebe seine Schreibutensilien und das Glas Wasser zurecht, das stets auf seinem Pulte stand, prüfte eine Sache mit abwesendem Gesichtsausdruck von mehreren Seiten und hatte übrigens die Gewohnheit, fünf- oder sechsmal während der Kontorzeit hinaus auf den Hof und in die Waschküche zu gehen, um seinen ganzen Kopf unter den Strahl der Wasserleitung zu halten und sich so zu erfrischen.","After the Consul's death, business had continued uninterruptedly and steadily. But it soon became apparent that since Thomas Buddenbrook had taken the reins, a more brilliant, a fresher and more enterprising spirit had ruled the business.

The gentlemen at the stock exchange nodded to each other. ""Buddenbrook wants to make money with avec,"" they said. But they thought it was a good thing that Thomas had to drag the honorable Herr Friedrich Wilhelm Marcus behind him like a lead ball by the foot. Herr Marcus' influence was the retarding element in the course of business. He carefully stroked his mustache with two fingers, arranged his writing utensils and the glass of water that always stood on his desk with painstaking love of order, examined a matter from several sides with a absent expression on his face, and incidentally had the habit of saying five or six times during the to go out into the yard and into the laundry room during office hours, to hold his whole head under the jet of water and refresh himself in this way.","The business had continued on its solid course, uninterrupted by the consul’s death.

He would carefully stroke his mustache with two fingers, compulsively rearrange his writing utensils and the glass of water that always stood on his desk, examine each issue from several sides, always with a wool-gathering look on his face; and he also had the habit of crossing the courtyard to the scullery, five or six times a day during office hours—where he would hold his head under the tap to refresh himself.","The business had taken its uninterrupted and solid course after the Consul's death. But soon after Thomas Bud den-brook seized the reins, a fresher and more enterprising spirit began to be noticeable in the management. Risks were taken now and then.

"»Ich glaube, er inkliniert nicht zum Solistentum«, sagte sie zu Herrn Pfühl, »und ich bin eigentlich froh darüber, denn es hat seine Schattenseiten. Ich rede nicht über die Abhängigkeit des Solisten von der Begleitung, obgleich sie unter Umständen sehr empfindlich werden kann, und wenn ich Sie nicht hätte … Aber dann besteht immer die Gefahr, daß man in mehr oder minder vollendetes Virtuosentum gerät … Sehen Sie, ich weiß ein Lied davon zu singen. Ich bekenne Ihnen offen, ich bin der Ansicht, daß für den Solisten eigentlich die Musik erst mit einem sehr hohen Grade von Können beginnt. Die angestrengte Konzentration auf die Oberstimme, ihre Phrasierung und Tonbildung, wobei die Polyphonie nur als etwas sehr Vages und Allgemeines zum Bewußtsein kommt, kann bei mittelmäßig Begabten ganz leicht eine Verkümmerung des harmonischen Sinnes und des Gedächtnisses für Harmonien zur Folge haben, die später schwer zu korrigieren ist. Ich liebe meine Geige und habe es ziemlich weit mit ihr gebracht, aber eigentlich steht das Klavier mir höher … Ich sage nur dies: die Vertrautheit mit dem Klavier, als mit einem Mittel, die vielfältigsten und reichsten Tongebilde zu resümieren, einem unübertrefflichen Mittel zur musikalischen Reproduktion, bedeutet für mich ein intimeres, klareres und umfassenderes Verhältnis zur Musik … Hören Sie, Pfühl, ich möchte Sie gleich selbst für ihn in Anspruch nehmen, seien Sie so gut! Ich weiß wohl, es gibt hier in der Stadt noch zwei oder drei Leute – ich glaube, weiblichen Geschlechts –, die Unterricht geben; aber das sind eben Klavierlehrerinnen … Sie verstehen mich … Es kommt so wenig darauf an, auf ein Instrument dressiert zu werden, sondern vielmehr darauf, ein wenig von Musik zu verstehen, nicht wahr?… Auf Sie verlasse ich mich. Sie nehmen die Sache ernster. Und Sie sollen sehen, Sie werden ganz guten Erfolg mit ihm haben. Er hat die Buddenbrookschen Hände … Die Buddenbrooks können alle Nonen und Dezimen greifen. – Aber sie haben noch niemals Gewicht darauf gelegt«, schloß sie lachend, und Herr Pfühl erklärte sich bereit, den Unterricht zu übernehmen.","""I don't think he's inclined to be a soloist,"" she said to Mr. Pfühl, ""and I'm actually glad about that, because it has its downsides. I'm not talking about the soloist's dependence on the accompaniment, although it can get very sensitive under certain circumstances, and if I didn't have it... But then there's always the danger of falling into more or less perfect virtuosity... You see, I know to sing a song about it. I admit to you openly that I am of the opinion that music really only begins for the soloist with a very high degree of ability. The strained concentration on the upper part, its phrasing and intonation, in which the polyphony is only conscious of something very vague and general, can easily lead to an atrophy of the harmonic sense and memory for harmonies in the case of the moderately gifted, which later becomes difficult to achieve correct is. I love my violin and have come quite a long way with it, but actually the piano ranks higher for me ... I will only say this: the familiarity with the piano as a means of summarizing the most varied and richest tonal structures, an unsurpassable means of musical For me, reproduction means a more intimate, clearer and more comprehensive relationship to the music... Listen, Pfühl, I would like to claim you for him right away, be so good! I know well there are two or three other people here in town - I think they are female - who teach; but they're piano teachers... You understand me... It's so little about being trained on an instrument as it is about understanding a little bit of music, isn't it?... I'm counting on you. You take things more seriously. And you shall see, you will have quite good success with it. He's got Buddenbrook's hands... The Buddenbrooks can grab all the ninths and tenths. - But they've never put any weight on it,' she concluded with a laugh, and Mr. Pfühl agreed to take over the lessons.","“I don’t think he will ever be a soloist,” she said to Herr Pfühl, “and actually I’m quite glad about that, because it has its drawbacks. By which I don’t mean the soloist’s dependence on accompaniment, although that can be distressing on occasion. And if I did not have you, Pfühl … But there is always the danger that one may get caught up in nothing but virtuosity of one kind or another. And I certainly could tell you a tale about that. To be frank, I must admit that it seems to me that music only really begins for the soloist when he has achieved a very high degree of skill. It requires intense concentration on the treble voice and the phrasing of the melodic line, whereas polyphony remains something only very vague and general, and in someone of mediocre talents that can mean the atrophy of any sense of harmony or the ability to retain harmonic structures, which is very difficult to correct later on. I love my violin and have come rather far with it, but I value the piano more. What I am saying is that, for me, familiarity with the piano—which in its ability to recapitulate the most complex and rich harmonies provides a unique means of musical reproduction—results in a clearer, more intimate and comprehensive relationship with music. Hear me out, Pfühl—I would like to enlist you to teach him. Please do me the favor. I know very well that there are two or three other people here in town—all of them women , I believe—who could instruct him, but they are mere piano teachers. You do understand, don’t you? It has little or nothing to do with training someone on an instrument, but, rather, with his understanding music. I trust you. You take the matter more seriously. And you shall see—you’ll have fine success with him. He has Buddenbrook hands—and Buddenbrooks can span ninths or tenths. But they’ve never considered it important,” she concluded with a laugh. And Herr Pfühl declared himself willing to give Hanno lessons.","""I hardly think,"" she told Herr Pfiihl, ""that he is suited for solo work; and on the whole I am glad, for it has its bad side apart from the dependence of the soloist upon his ac-companist, which can be very serious too;--if I did not have you, for instance!--there is always the danger of yielding to more or less complete virtuosity. You see, I know whereof I speak. I tell you frankly that, for the soloist, a high degree of ability is only the first step. The concentration on the tone and phrasing of the treble, which reduces the whole polyphony to something vague and indefinite in the consciousness, must surely spoil the feeling for harmony--unless the person is more than usually gifted--and the mem-ory as well, which is most difficult to correct later on. I love my violin, and I have accomplished a good deal with it; bui to tell the truth, I place the piano higher. What I mean is this: familiarity with the piano, as a means of summarizing the richest and most varied structures, as an incomparable instrument for musical reproduction, means for me a clearer, more intimate and comprehensive intercourse with music. Listen, Pf� hl. I would like to have you take him, if you will be so good. I know there are two or three people here in the town who give lessons--women, I think. But they are simply piano-teachers. You know what I mean. I feel that it matters so little whether one is trained upon an instrument, and so much whether one knows something about music. I depend upon you. And you will see, you will succeed with him. He has the Buddenbrook hand. The Buddenbrooks can all strike the ninths and tenths--only they have never set any store by it,"" she concluded, laughing.

Und während er es nun begreifen und erkennen durfte – nicht in Worten und aufeinanderfolgenden Gedanken, sondern in plötzlichen, beseligenden Erhellungen seines Inneren –, war er schon frei, war er ganz eigentlich schon erlöst und aller natürlichen wie künstlichen Schranken und Bande entledigt. Die Mauern seiner Vaterstadt, in denen er sich mit Willen und Bewußtsein eingeschlossen, taten sich auf und erschlossen seinem Blicke die Welt, die ganze Welt, von der er in jungen Jahren dies und jenes Stückchen gesehen, und die der Tod ihm ganz und gar zu schenken versprach. Die trügerischen Erkenntnisformen des Raumes, der Zeit und also der Geschichte, die Sorge um ein rühmliches, historisches Fortbestehen in der Person von Nachkommen, die Furcht vor irgendeiner endlichen historischen Auflösung und Zersetzung, – dies alles gab seinen Geist frei und hinderte ihn nicht mehr, die stete Ewigkeit zu begreifen. Nichts begann und nichts hörte auf.

And while he was now allowed to understand and recognize it - not in words and successive thoughts, but in sudden, blissful illuminations of his inner being - he was already free, he was actually already redeemed and rid of all natural and artificial barriers and bonds. The walls of his native city, in which he shut himself up willingly and consciously, opened up and revealed the world to his eyes, the whole world, of which he had seen this and that bit when he was young, and which death opened up to him completely promised to give.

"In der Tat, die vortrefflichen Gelehrten, die unter der freundlichen Herrschaft eines humanen, tabakschnupfenden, alten Direktors in den Gewölben der alten Schule – einer ehemaligen Klosterschule – ihres Amtes walteten, waren harmlose und gutmütige Leute, einig in der Ansicht, daß Wissenschaft und Heiterkeit einander nicht ausschlössen, und bestrebt, mit Wohlwollen und Behagen zu Werke zu gehen. Es war da in den mittleren Klassen ein ehemaliger Prediger, der im Lateinischen unterrichtete, ein gewisser Pastor Hirte, ein langer Herr mit braunem Backenbart und munteren Augen, dessen Lebensglück geradezu in dieser Übereinstimmung seines Namens mit seinem Titel bestand, und der nicht oft genug die Vokabel pastor sich übersetzen lassen konnte. Seine Lieblingsredensart lautete »grenzenlos borniert!« und es ist niemals aufgeklärt worden, ob dies ein bewußter Scherz war. Beabsichtigte er aber, seine Schüler völlig zu verblüffen, so gebot er über die Kunst, die Lippen in den Mund zu klemmen und sie wieder hinauszuschnellen, in einer Art, daß es knallte wie ein springender Champagnerpfropfen. Er liebte es, mit langen Schritten im Klassenzimmer umherzugehen und einzelnen Schülern mit ungeheurer Lebhaftigkeit ihr ganzes zukünftiges Leben zu erzählen, und zwar zu dem ausgesprochenen Zwecke, ihre Phantasie ein bißchen anzuregen. Dann aber ging er ernstlich zur Arbeit über, das heißt, er überhörte die Verse, die er über genus-Regeln – er sagte »Genußregeln« – und allerhand schwierige Konstruktionen mit wirklichem Geschick gedichtet hatte, Verse, die Pastor Hirte mit unaussprechlich triumphierender Betonung des Rhythmus und der Reime hervorbrachte …","Indeed, the excellent scholars who ministered under the friendly rule of a humane, tobacco-sniffing old headmaster in the vaults of the old school—a former convent school—were harmless and good-natured people, united in the belief that science and merriment not mutually exclusive, and striving to work with benevolence and ease. There was in the middle classes a former preacher who taught Latin, a certain Pastor Hirte, a tall gentleman with brown whiskers and bright eyes, whose happiness in life consisted in this correspondence of his name with his title, and who did not often enough word pastor could be translated.

He loved to walk about the classroom with long strides, and to tell individual students their whole future life with tremendous vivacity, with the express purpose of stimulating their imaginations a little. But then he went seriously to work, that is, he ignored the verses which he had composed with real skill about rules of genus - he said ""rules of enjoyment"" - and all sorts of difficult constructions, verses which Pastor Hirte had inexpressibly triumphantly emphasized the Rhythm and the rhymes produced...","Indeed, under the friendly, watchful eye of a humane, snuff-taking old director, the splendid scholars who did their duty beneath the Gothic arches of the Old School—a convent school in bygone years—were harmless and well-intentioned men, united in their view that science and good cheer were not mutually exclusive categories, and they set about their work with benevolence and gusto. In the middle grades there was a certain Pastor Shepherd, a retired cleric who taught Latin, a tall man with brown whiskers and merry eyes, whose greatest joy in life was that his last name and his title were synonymous and who never tired of having his charges translate the Latin word “pastor.” His favorite turn of phrase was “Inexhaustibly vacuous!,” and no one ever found out if he himself was aware of the joke.

He loved to pace about his classroom with long strides and grew astoundingly animated as he laid out for each student the future course of his life, always with the manifest purpose of stimulating his imagination. Then he would return to work in earnest, which is to say, he listened to their recitations of some very clever verses he had composed for explaining difficult constructions and the rules of gender—“What’s good for the goose is good for the gender,” he would say—and then repeat the verses himself, stressing each rhythm and rhyme with inexpressible triumph.","In truth, they were all admirable scholars, the masters who taught in the cloisters of the old school--once a monastic foundation--under the guidance of a kindly, snuff-taking old head.

His favourite expression was ""boundlessly limited""; but it was never quite clear whether this was actually meant for a joke or not!

He would go up and down with long strides in his class-room, prophesying to one boy or another, with great vividness, the course which his life would take. He did this avowedly with the purpose of stimulating their imaginations; and then he would set to work seriously on the business in hand, which was to repeat certain verses on the rules of gender and difficult constructions. He had composed these verses himself, with no little skill, and took much pride in declaiming them, with great attention to rhyme and rhythm."

"Hanno, nun elfjährig, war zu Ostern ebenso wie sein Freund, der kleine Graf Mölln, mit genauer Not und zwei Nachprüfungen, im Rechnen und in der Geographie, nach Quarta versetzt worden. Es stand fest, daß er die Realklassen besuchen sollte, denn daß er Kaufmann werden und dereinst die Firma übernehmen mußte, war selbstverständlich, und Fragen seines Vaters, ob er Lust zu seinem künftigen Berufe in sich verspüre, beantwortete er mit Ja … einem einfachen, etwas scheuen Ja ohne Zusatz, das der Senator durch weitere drängende Fragen ein wenig lebhafter und ausführlicher zu machen suchte – und zwar meistens vergebens.","Hanno, now eleven years old, had been transferred to Quarta at Easter, just like his friend, little Count Mölln, with exacting difficulties and two re-examinations in arithmetic and geography.

It was decided that he would now take modern, scientific classes, because, of course, he was to be a merchant and would take over the firm someday. In reply to his father’s questions about whether he was excited about the idea of such a future profession, he always answered yes—a simple, somewhat shy yes, nothing more. The senator would always try to elicit a little livelier, fuller answer—but usually to no avail.","Hanno was now eleven years old.

"Alle seine Kräfte nahmen ab; was sich in ihm verstärkte, war allein die Überzeugung, daß dies alles nicht lange währen könne, und daß sein Hintritt nahe bevorstehe. Es kamen ihm seltsame und ahnungsvolle Vorstellungen. Einige Male befiel ihn bei Tische die Empfindung, daß er schon nicht mehr eigentlich mit den Seinen zusammensitze, sondern, in eine gewisse, verschwommene Ferne entrückt, zu ihnen hinüberblicke … Ich werde sterben, sagte er sich, und er rief abermals Hanno zu sich und sprach auf ihn ein: »Ich kann früher dahingehen, als wir denken, mein Sohn.

"Die Sitzung war nicht eröffnet, aber die Debatte war äußerst rege. Alle Herren verfluchten diesen Skribifax, diesen Redakteur, diesen Rübsam, von dem man wußte, daß er die Menge aufgewiegelt habe … und zwar wozu? Man war hier, um festzustellen, ob das ständische Prinzip in der Volksvertretung beizubehalten oder das allgemeine und gleiche Wahlrecht einzuführen sei. Der Senat hatte bereits das letztere beantragt. Was aber wollte das Volk? Es wollte den Herren an den Kragen, das war alles. Es war, zum Teufel, die faulste Lage, in der sich die Herren jemals befunden hatten! Man umringte die Senatskommissare, um ihre Meinung zu erfahren. Man umringte auch Konsul Buddenbrook, der wissen mußte, wie Bürgermeister Överdieck sich zu der Sache verhielt; denn seitdem im vorigen Jahre Senator Doktor Överdieck, ein Schwager Konsul Justus Krögers, Senatspräsident geworden war, waren Buddenbrooks mit dem Bürgermeister verwandt, was sie in der öffentlichen Achtung beträchtlich hatte steigen lassen …","The session did not open, but the debate was extremely lively. All gentlemen cursed this Scribifax, this editor, this Rübsam, who was known to have incited the crowd ... and for what? They were here to determine whether the principle of estates should be retained in the people's representation or whether universal and equal suffrage should be introduced. The Senate had already requested the latter. But what did the people want? It wanted to get at the gentlemen, that was all. It was, hell, the laziest position these gentlemen had ever been in! The Senate commissioners were surrounded to get their opinions. They also surrounded Consul Buddenbrook, who must have known how Mayor Överdieck felt about the matter; since Senator Doctor Överdieck, a brother-in-law of Consul Justus Kröger, had become President of the Senate last year, the Buddenbrooks had been related to the Mayor, which had increased their public respect considerably...","The meeting had not yet been opened, but the debate was extraordinarily lively. The gentlemen cursed Rübsam—ink-slinger and editor—who they all knew had incited the mob. But to what end? They had assembled to determine whether to retain restricted voting rights or to introduce universal franchise. The senate had already proposed the latter. But what did the masses want? They wanted their hands on these gentlemen’s throats, that was all. Damn it, this was the unholiest mess in which these gentlemen had ever found themselves. They surrounded members of the senate delegation to hear their opinions. They also surrounded Consul Buddenbrook, who was sure to know how Mayor Oeverdieck felt about the matter, because the previous year Senator Dr. Oeverdieck, a brother-in-law of Consul Justus Kröger, had become president of the senate and mayor—and that meant that the Buddenbrooks were now related to the mayor, which greatly enhanced the esteem in which they were held.","The sitting was not yet opened, but debate was already lively.

The Senate had already proposed the lat-ter. But what did the people want? They wanted these gentlemen by the throats--no more and no less. It was the worst hole they had ever found themselves in, devil take it! The Senatorial Committee was surrounded, its members' opinion eagerly sought. They approached Consul Buddenbrook, as one who should know the attitude of Burgomaster Over-dieck; for since Senator Doctor Overdieck, Consul Justus Kroger's brother-in-law, had been made President last year, the Buddenbrooks were related to the Burgomaster; which had distinctly enhanced the regard in which they were held."

"Gräßliche Merkmale der beginnenden Auflösung zeigten sich, während die Organe, von einem zähen Willen in Gang gehalten, noch arbeiteten. Da, seit die Konsulin sich mit einem Katarrh hatte zu Bette legen müssen, Wochen vergangen waren, so hatten sich durch das Liegen an ihrem Körper mehrere Wunden gebildet, die sich nicht mehr schlossen und in einen fürchterlichen Zustand übergingen. Sie schlief nicht mehr; erstens, weil Schmerz, Husten und Atemnot sie daran hinderten, dann aber, weil sie selbst sich gegen den Schlaf auflehnte und sich an das Wachsein klammerte. Nur für Minuten ging ihr Bewußtsein im Fieber unter; aber auch bei bewußten Sinnen sprach sie laut mit Personen, die längst gestorben waren. Eines Nachmittags in der Dämmerung sagte sie plötzlich mit lauter, etwas ängstlicher, aber inbrünstiger Stimme: »Ja, mein lieber Jean, ich komme!« Und die Unmittelbarkeit dieser Antwort war so täuschend, daß man nachträglich die Stimme des verstorbenen Konsuls zu hören glaubte, der sie gerufen hatte.","Horrible signs of the beginning dissolution showed themselves while the organs, kept going by a tenacious will, were still working. Since weeks had passed since the consul had had to go to bed with catarrh, several wounds had formed on her body from lying down, which would not close and became a terrible condition. She slept no more; first because pain, coughing, and shortness of breath prevented her from doing so, but second because she herself rebelled against sleep and clung to wakefulness. For only minutes her consciousness was drowned in fever; but even with her conscious senses she spoke aloud to people who had long since died. One twilight afternoon she suddenly said in a loud, somewhat anxious but fervent voice: ""Yes, my dear Jean, I'm coming!"" who called her.","Ghastly signs that dissolution had begun were now apparent, but the bodily organs still functioned under the direction of a tenacious will. Weeks had passed now since Elisabeth Buddenbrook had taken to her bed with a catarrh, and several bedsores had developed that would not heal and looked truly odious. She no longer slept—at first because of pain, coughing fits, and shortness of breath, but later because she resisted sleep and fought to stay awake. She slipped into a fevered stupor for only a few minutes at a time, but even when fully conscious she would speak aloud to people long since dead. One afternoon, as twilight fell, she suddenly said in a loud, anxious, but passionate voice, “Yes, my dear Jean, I’m coming.” There had been something so strikingly immediate about her reply that they almost believed they had heard the voice of the late consul calling her.","Dreadful symptoms of the coming dissolution showed them-selves, even though the organs, still in command of a tenacious will, continued to function. It had now been weeks since Frau Consul first took to her bed with a cold; and she began to have bed sores. They would not heal, and grew worse and worse. She could not sleep, because of pain, coughing and shortness of breath, and also because she herself clung to con-sciousness with all her might. Only for minutes at a time did she lose herself in fever; but now she began, even when she was conscious, to talk to people who had long been dead. One afternoon, in the twilight, she said suddenly, in a loud, fervent, anxious voice, ""Yes, my dear Jean, I am coming!""

Und das ist nun schon die zweite, denn die erste Person, welche Kathi hieß, habe ich mir erlaubt, aus dem Hause zu schicken, weil sie immer gleich grob wurde; oder wenigstens schien es mir so, denn ich kann mich auch geirrt haben, wie ich nachträglich einsehe, denn man weiß hier nicht recht, ob die Leute eigentlich grob oder freundlich reden.

And that's already the second one, because I took the liberty of sending the first person, whose name was Kathi, out of the house because she always got rude; or at least that's how it seemed to me, because I could also have been wrong, as I see later, because here you don't really know whether people are actually talking rudely or kindly.

I took the liberty of firing the first one, a girl named Kathi, because she was always rude; or at least it seemed to me that she was, although in hindsight I may have been mistaken, because one is never quite sure here whether people are being rude or friendly.

"»Praktische Ideale … na, ja …« Der alte Buddenbrook spielte während einer Pause, die er seinen Kinnladen gönnte, mit seiner goldenen Dose. »Praktische Ideale … ne, ich bin da gar nich für!« Er verfiel vor Verdruß in den Dialekt. »Da schießen nun die gewerblichen Anstalten und die technischen Anstalten und die Handelsschulen aus der Erde, und das Gymnasium und die klassische Bildung sind plötzlich Bêtisen, und alle Welt denkt an nichts, als Bergwerke … und Industrie … und Geldverdienen … Brav, das alles, höchst brav! Aber ein bißchen stüpide, von der anderen Seite, so auf die Dauer – wie? Ich weiß nicht, warum es mir ein Affront ist … ich habe nichts gesagt, Jean … die Juli-Monarchie ist eine gute Sache …«","'Practical ideals ... well, yes ...' Old Buddenbrook played with his golden can during a break that he allowed his jaws to spread. “Practical ideals… no, I'm not for them at all!” He lapsed into dialect in frustration. »Then the commercial institutions and the technical institutions and the trade schools are springing up all of a sudden, and the grammar school and classical education are suddenly Bêtisen, and the whole world thinks of nothing but mines ... and industry ... and making money ... Brav, all that, very good! But a bit stubborn, from the other side, in the long run - huh? I don't know why it's an affront to me...I didn't say anything, Jean...the July monarchy is a good thing...""","“Practical ideals—well, yes …” Buddenbrook senior played with his gold snuffbox and rewarded his jaws with a little rest. “Practical ideals. Nope, set no store by ’em at all!” In his annoyance he had fallen back into Plattdeutsch. “Trade schools and technical schools and commercial schools are popping up like mushrooms, and grammar schools and classical education are suddenly all foolishness, and the whole world has nothing in its head but coal mines and factories and making money. Fine, fine, it’s all very fine. But on the other hand a bit stupide, over the long term—is it not? I don’t know why it offends me so much—though I’m not saying, Jean, that the July Monarchy isn’t a fine thing.…”","""Practical ideals-- well, yees--"" The elder Buddenbrook gave his jaws a moment's rest and played with his gold snuff-box. "" Practical ideals--well--h'm--they don't appeal to me in the least."" He dropped into dialect, out of sheer vex- ation. ""We have trade schools and technical schools and cummercial schools springing up on every corner; the high schools and the classical education suddenly turn out to be all foolishness, and the whole world thinks of nothing but mines and factories and making money.... That's all very fine, of course. But in the long run, pretty stupid, isn't it?... I don't know why, but it irritates me like the deuce.... I don't mean, Jean, that the July Monarchy is not an admirable regime...."""
"In der Tat, sie fand Herrn Grünlich, wenn sie nachmittags von einem Besuche, einer Mädchengesellschaft zurückkehrte, eingenistet im Landschaftszimmer, woselbst er der Konsulin aus Walter Scotts »Waverley« vorlas – und zwar mit mustergültiger Aussprache, denn die Reisen im Dienste seines regen Geschäftes hatten ihn, wie er berichtete, auch nach England geführt. Tony setzte sich seitab mit einem anderen Buche, und Herr Grünlich fragte mit weicher Stimme: »Es entspricht wohl nicht Ihrem Geschmacke, mein Fräulein, was ich lese?« Worauf sie mit zurückgeworfenem Kopf etwas recht spitzig Sarkastisches erwiderte, wie zum Beispiel: »Nicht im geringsten!«","In fact, when she returned in the afternoon from a visit to a girls' party, she found Herr Grünlich nested in the landscape room, where he read to the consul from Walter Scott's ""Waverley"" - and with exemplary pronunciation, for the trips were in the service of his brisk business had, as he reported, also brought him to England. Tony sat down to the side with another book, and Herr Grünlich asked in a soft voice, ""I suppose what I'm reading doesn't suit your taste, miss?"" To which, with her head thrown back, she replied something rather pointedly sarcastic, such as, ""No in the least!«","And, indeed, returning home one afternoon from a visit with other young ladies, she found Herr Grünlich ensconced in the landscape room, reading Walter Scott’s Waverley aloud to her mother—in impeccable English, because, as he explained, his flourishing business had meant many trips to England. Tony picked up a book and took a seat at the far end of the room. Herr Grünlich asked in a gentle voice, “Apparently what I am reading is not to your taste, Fräulein?” She tossed her head back and, in a pointed, sarcastic tone, replied something like, “Not in the least.”","And, sure enough, coining back one afternoon from a visit with some girl friends, she found Herr Gr�nlich cosily estab-lished in the landscape-room, reading aloud to the Frau Con-sul out of Sir Walter Scott's ""Waverly. "" His pronunciation was perfect, for, as he explained, his business trips had taken him to England. Tony sat down apart with another book, and Herr Gr�nlich softly questioned: ""Our book is not to your taste, Fraulein?"" To which -she replied, with her head in the air, something in a sarcastic vein, like ""Not in the very least."""
"»Fühlen Sie sich nicht ganz wohl, lieber Vater?« fragte er besorgt …","""Don't you feel quite well, dear father?"" he asked concerned...","“Aren’t you feeling well, Father?” he asked worriedly.","""Aren't you feeling well, dear Father?"" he asked anxiously."
"Und er kam. Er kam in einem nicht ganz neumodischen, aber feinen, glockenförmigen und faltigen Gehrock, der ihm einen Anstrich von Ernst und Solidität verlieh, – rosig übrigens und lächelnd, das spärliche Haar sorgfältig gescheitelt und mit duftig frisierten Favoris. Er aß Muschelragout, Juliennesuppe, gebackene Seezungen, Kalbsbraten mit Rahmkartoffeln und Blumenkohl, Marasquino-Pudding und Pumpernickel mit Roquefort und fand bei jedem Gerichte einen neuen Lobspruch, den er mit Delikatesse vorzubringen verstand. Er hob zum Beispiel seinen Dessertlöffel empor, blickte eine Statue der Tapete an und sprach laut zu sich selbst: »Gott verzeihe mir, ich kann nicht anders; ich habe ein großes Stück genossen, aber dieser Pudding ist gar zu prächtig gelungen; ich muß die gütige Wirtin noch um ein Stückchen ersuchen!« Worauf er der Konsulin schalkhaft zublinzelte. Er sprach mit dem Konsul über Geschäfte und Politik, wobei er ernste und tüchtige Grundsätze an den Tag legte, er plauderte mit der Konsulin über Theater, Gesellschaften und Toiletten; er hatte auch für Tom, Christian und die arme Klothilde, ja selbst für die kleine Klara und Mamsell Jungmann liebenswürdige Worte … Tony verhielt sich schweigsam, und er seinerseits unternahm es nicht, sich ihr zu nähern, sondern betrachtete sie nur dann und wann mit seitwärts geneigtem Kopfe und einem Blick, in dem sowohl Betrübnis wie Ermunterung lag.","And he came. He came in a not entirely new-fangled, but fine, bell-shaped and pleated frock coat, which gave him an air of seriousness and solidity - rosy, by the way, and smiling, his sparse hair carefully parted and with fragrantly coiffed favourites. He ate mussel stew, julienne soup, baked sole, roast veal with creamed potatoes and cauliflower, Marasquino pudding, and pumpernickel with Roquefort, and found a new praise for each dish that he knew how to utter with delicacy. For example, he would lift his dessert spoon, look at a statue on the wallpaper, and say aloud to himself, “God forgive me, I can't help it; I enjoyed a large piece, but this pudding turned out too splendidly; I still have to ask the kind landlady for a little more!' Whereupon he winked mischievously at the consul. He conferred with the Consul on business and politics, displaying serious and sound principles; he chatted with the Consul about theatre, society, and toilets; he also had kind words for Tom, Christian and poor Klothilde, yes even for little Klara and Mamsell Jungmann... Tony remained silent and for his part he did not attempt to approach her, but only looked at her sideways from time to time bowed head and a look in which was both sadness and encouragement.","And he came. He came in a bell-shaped pleated coat, not in the latest fashion but of the best quality, lending him an air of solidity and dignity—and smiling and pink-faced as always, his thinning hair carefully combed, his whiskers curled and scented. He ate mussel ragout, julienne soup, baked sole, roast veal with mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts, maraschino pudding, and pumpernickel with Roquefort cheese—and at each course he offered a new tribute appropriate to the delicacy. For example, raising his dessert spoon, he gazed at a statue woven into the wallpaper and said aloud to himself, “God forgive me, I can do no other; I’ve eaten a large serving, but this pudding is just too splendid. I simply must implore my hostess for a second helping.” And then he flashed Madame Buddenbrook a roguish look. He spoke with the consul about business and politics, propounding some very serious and germane principles; he chatted with the consul’s wife about fashions, balls, and the theater; he had kind words for Tom, Christian, and poor Klothilde, even for little Clara and Mamselle Jungmann. Tony kept her silence. He made no attempt to engage her attention, either, except that now and then he tilted his head to gaze at her with a look filled with both distress and encouragement.","And he came. He came in a not quite new-fashioned, rather wrinkled, but still handsome bell-shaped frock coat which gave him a solid, respectable look. He was rosy and smiling, his scant hair carefully parted, his whiskers curled and scented. He ate a ragout of shell-fish, julienne soup, fried soles, l oast veal with creamed potatoes and cauliflower, mara-schino pudding, and pumpernickel with roquefort; and he found a fresh and delicate compliment for each fresh course .101 Over the sweet he lifted his dessert-spoon, gazed at one of the tapestry statues, and spoke aloud to himself, thus: ""God forgive me, I have eaten far too well already. But this pud-ding--! It is too wonderful! I must beg my good hostess for another slice."" And he looked roguishly at the Consul's wife. With the Consul he talked business and politics, and spoke soundly and weightily. He discussed the theatre and the fashions with the Frau Consul, and he had a good word for Tom and Christian and Clothilde, and even for little Clara and Ida Jungmann. Tony sat in silence, and he did not un-dertake to engage her; only gazing at her now and then, with his head a little tilted, his face looking dejected and encouraged by turns."

"Der Konsulin war dies ganz einfach mitgeteilt worden. In den Briefen aber, die Frau Permaneder darüber an ihren Bruder geschrieben hatte, war der Schmerz zu erkennen gewesen, den sie empfand … arme Tony! ihre schlimmsten Befürchtungen waren weitaus übertroffen worden. Sie hatte zuvor gewußt, daß Herr Permaneder nichts von der »Regsamkeit« besaß, von der ihr erster Gatte zu viel an den Tag gelegt hatte; daß er aber so gänzlich die Erwartungen zuschanden machen werde, die sie noch am Vorabend ihrer Verlobung gegen Mamsell Jungmann ausgesprochen hatte, daß er so völlig die Verpflichtungen verkennen werde, die er übernahm, indem er eine Buddenbrook ehelichte, das hatte sie nicht geahnt …","The Consul had been told this quite simply. But in the letters Mrs. Permaneder had written to her brother about it, the pain she felt was evident...poor Tony! her worst fears had been far exceeded. She had known before that Herr Permaneder had none of the ""activity"" of which her first husband had shown too much; but that he would so completely spoil the expectations she had expressed to Mamsell Jungmann on the eve of her engagement, that he would so completely misjudge the obligations that he had assumed by marrying a Buddenbrook, she had not suspected...","Madame Buddenbrook was simply informed of the matter. But Frau Permaneder’s pain was evident in the letters she wrote her brother about what had happened. Poor Tony—her worst fears had been more than realized. She had known all along that Herr Permaneder had none of the industriousness that her first husband had displayed far too much of. But that he should so totally dash all the hopes she had shared with Mamselle Jungmann on the evening before her engagement, that he could fail so completely to recognize the obligations he had assumed in marrying a Buddenbrook— no, she had never dreamed of that.","The Frau Consul was notified quite simply of thia fact. But Frau Permaneder's distress was evident in the letters which she wrote to her brother. Poor Tony! Her worst fears were more than realized. She had always known that Herr Permaneder possessed none of that ""resourrefulness"" of which her first husband had had so much; but that he would so en-tirely confound the expectations she had expressed to Mam sell Jungmann on the eve of her betrothal--that he would so com-pletely fail to recognize the duties he had taken upon himself when he married a Buddenbrook--that she had never dreamed."
"Und kaum hat dieser Zustand eine Sekunde lang gedauert, als ein plötzlicher Stoß, eine ruckartige Bewegung durch die ganze Menschenansammlung geht, ein Schub, der sich von vorn nach hinten fortsetzt und die Vorderen gegen ihre Hintermänner lehnt, während zu gleicher Zeit dort hinten im Portale etwas Hellrotes aufblitzt … Die roten Röcke der beiden Ratsdiener, Kaspersen und Uhlefeldt, welche in Gala, mit Dreispitz, weißen Reithosen, gelben Stulpen und Galanteriedegen, Seite an Seite erscheinen und durch die zurückweichende Menge hindurch ihren Weg gehen.","And scarcely has this condition lasted for a second than a sudden jolt, a jerky movement goes through the whole crowd, a thrust which continues from front to back and the front leans against their backers, while at the same time there at the back in the portal something bright red flashes … The red skirts of the two council servants, Kaspersen and Uhlefeldt, who appear side by side in gala wear, with tricorne hats, white breeches, yellow cuffs and gallantry swords, and make their way through the retreating crowd.","This state of affairs lasts for a mere second—then the whole crowd lurches backward in a wave of shoving that moves from the front to the rear, so that everyone is leaning back against the person behind; and at the same time something bright red flashes just behind the door—the red coats of the two bailiffs, Kaspersen and Uhlefeldt, in full regalia: three-cornered hats, white riding breeches, wide yellow cuffs, and ceremonial swords. They walk side by side, making their way through the crowd, which pulls back as they pass.","This state of things has lasted a second or so, when there occurs a shouting and a backward jostling of the throng. It runs through the whole assemblage, as those in front press back those behind, and at the same time something red appears in the doorway. It is the coats of the bfarlles Kaspersen and Uhlefeldt. They are in full-dress uniform, with white riding breeches, three-cornered hats, yellow gaunt-let gloves, and short dress swords. They appear side by side, and make their way through the crowd, which falls back before them."
"Soeben war ich zum Kaffee bei Madame Käselau, in der Nähe; es sind angenehme Leute, und auch unsere Nachbarn linkerhand, namens Gußmann (aber die Häuser liegen ziemlich weit voneinander), sind umgängliche Menschen. Wir haben ein paar gute Hausfreunde, die beide ebenfalls hier draußen wohnen: den Doktor Klaaßen (von welchem ich Dir nachher noch werde erzählen müssen) und den Bankier Kesselmeyer, Grünlichs intimen Freund. Du glaubst nicht, was für ein komischer alter Herr das ist! Er hat einen weißen, geschorenen Backenbart und schwarz-weiße dünne Haare auf dem Kopf, die aussehen wie Flaumfedern und in jedem Luftzuge flattern. Da er auch so drollige Kopfbewegungen hat wie ein Vogel und ziemlich geschwätzig ist, nenne ich ihn immer »die Elster«; aber Grünlich verbietet mir dies, denn er sagt, die Elster stehle, Herr Kesselmeyer aber sei ein Ehrenmann. Beim Gehen bückt er sich und rudert mit den Armen. Seine Flaumfedern reichen nur bis zur Hälfte des Hinterkopfes, und von da an ist sein Nacken ganz rot und rissig. Er hat etwas so äußerst Fröhliches an sich! Manchmal klopft er mir auf die Wange und sagt: Sie gute kleine Frau, welch Gottessegen für Grünlich, daß er Sie bekommen hat! Dann sucht er einen Zwicker hervor (er hat stets drei davon bei sich, an langen Schnüren, die sich beständig auf seiner weißen Weste verwickeln), schlägt ihn sich auf die Nase, die er ganz kraus dabei macht, und sieht mich mit offenem Munde so vergnüglich an, daß ich ihm laut ins Gesicht lache. Aber das nimmt er gar nicht übel.","I was just having coffee at Madame Käselau's nearby; they are pleasant people, and our neighbors on the left, named Gußmann (but the houses are quite far apart), are sociable people. We have a couple of good family friends who both also live out here: Doctor Klaassen (whom I'll have to tell you about later) and banker Kesselmeyer, Grünlich's intimate friend. You won't believe what a funny old gentleman that is! He has trimmed white whiskers and thin black-and-white hair that looks like feathers and flutters in every breeze. Since he also has funny head movements like a bird and is quite talkative, I always call him ""the magpie""; but Grünlich forbids me to do so, because he says the magpie steals, but Herr Kesselmeyer is a man of honour. When walking, he bends down and flails his arms. His downy feathers only go halfway down the back of his head, and from there his neck is all red and cracked. There's something so very happy about him! Sometimes he slaps me on the cheek and says: You good little woman, what a godsend for Grünlich that he got you! Then he pulls out a pair of pince-nez (he always has three of them with him, on long cords that keep getting tangled on his white waistcoat), slaps them on his nose, which he crinkles all over, and gapes at me like that happily that I laugh out loud in his face. But he doesn't mind that at all.","I just returned from coffee with Madame Käselau, a neighbor. They’re pleasant people, and our neighbors on the left, the name is Gussmann (but our houses are rather far apart), are sociable, too.

You can’t imagine what a funny old man he is! He has close-trimmed white whiskers and salt-and-pepper hair on top of his head that looks like goose down and flutters in the breeze. He makes funny motions with his head, like a bird, and is something of a chatterbox, I call him “the magpie”; but Grünlich has forbidden me to say that, because magpies are thieves and Herr Kesselmeyer is an honest man. He walks all hunched over and rows with his arms. The goose down reaches only about halfway down the back of his neck, and his nape is bright red and all wrinkly. He has such a merry way about him. Sometimes he pats my cheek and says, What a good little wife, Grünlich can count his blessings that he got you! And then he pulls out his pince-nez (he always carries three of them, on long cords that dangle at his white vest and get all tangled up), sets it on his nose, which he wrinkles up tight, and stares at me pleased as punch, with his mouth wide open, so that I simply have to laugh at him. But he’s not at all offended.","I've just been to coffee at Madame Kaselau's, a neighbour of mine.

"Die Ärzte gingen, und Senator Buddenbrook wandte sich, um noch einmal in das Krankenzimmer zurückzukehren. Er überlegte, was Grabow gesagt hatte … Es hatte soviel Hinterhältiges darin gelegen … Man hatte gefühlt, wie er sich vor einer entschiedenen Äußerung hütete. Das einzige klare Wort war »Lungenentzündung« gewesen, und dieses Wort wurde nicht tröstlicher dadurch, daß Doktor Langhals es in die Sprache der Wissenschaft übersetzt hatte. Lungenentzündung in den Jahren der Konsulin … Schon, daß es zwei Ärzte waren, die kamen und gingen, gab der Sache einen beunruhigenden Aspekt. Grabow hatte das ganz leichthin und fast unmerklich arrangiert. Er gedenke, sich über kurz oder lang zur Ruhe zu setzen, hatte er gesagt, und da der junge Langhals berufen sei, seine Praxis zu übernehmen, so mache er – Grabow – sich ein Vergnügen daraus, ihn hie und da schon jetzt heranzuziehen und einzuführen …","The doctors left, and Senator Buddenbrook turned to return to the sickroom once more. He thought about what Grabow had said... There had been so much underhandedness in it... One could sense that he was wary of making a decisive statement. The only clear word had been ""pneumonia,"" and that word was no more comforting to have Dr. Longneck translate it into the language of science. Pneumonia in the Consul years... Just that there were two doctors coming and going gave it a worrying aspect. Grabow had arranged it very lightly and almost imperceptibly. He was thinking of retiring sooner or later, he had said, and since the young Longneck was called to take over his practice, he - Grabow - took pleasure in training and introducing him now and then ...","The doctors left, and Senator Buddenbrook turned around to go back to his mother’s sickroom. He thought about what Grabow had said—there had been so much that he had left unsaid. One felt as if he were avoiding saying anything definite. The only specific thing that had been said was “pneumonia”—and there was little comfort in the fact that Dr. Langhals had chosen the scientific term. Pneumonia at his mother’s age—the fact that there were two doctors in attendance was in itself disquieting. Grabow had managed it all quite casually, almost without his noticing. He was thinking, Grabow had said, of retiring sooner or later, and since his intention was for young Langhals to take over his practice, he enjoyed bringing him along on cases now and then, by way of introduction.","The physicians took their leave, and Senator Buddenbrook turned to go back to the sick-room. He revolved what Dr. Giabow had said. He had spoken with reserve--he gave die 163 impression of avoiding anything definite. The single plain word was ""inflammation of the lungs""; which became no more reassuring after Dr. Langhals added the scientific terminology. Pneumonia--at the Frau Consul's age. The fact that there were two physicians coming and going was in itself dis-quieting. Grabow had arranged that very unobtrusively. HP intended to retire before long, and as young Dr. Langhals would then be taking over the practice, he, Dr. Grabow, would be pleased if he might bring him in now and again."

"Das Burgtor, das Burgtor erst, und dabei war es vier Minuten vor acht! Während er sich in kalter Transpiration, in Schmerz, Übelkeit und Not durch die Straßen kämpfte, spähte er nach allen Seiten, ob nicht vielleicht noch andre Schüler zu sehen seien … Nein, nein, es kam niemand mehr. Alle waren an Ort und Stelle, und da begann es auch schon acht Uhr zu schlagen! Die Glocken klangen durch den Nebel von allen Türmen, und diejenigen von Sankt Marien spielten zur Feier des Augenblicks sogar »Nun danket alle Gott« … Sie spielten es grundfalsch, wie Hanno rasend vor Verzweiflung konstatierte, sie hatten keine Ahnung von Rhythmus und waren höchst mangelhaft gestimmt … Aber das war nun das wenigste, das wenigste! Ja, er kam zu spät, es war wohl keine Frage mehr. Die Schuluhr war ein wenig im Rückstande, aber er kam dennoch zu spät, es war sicher. Er starrte den Leuten ins Gesicht, die an ihm vorübergingen. Sie begaben sich in ihre Kontore und an ihre Geschäfte, sie eilten gar nicht sehr, und nichts drohte ihnen. Manche erwiderten seinen neidischen und klagenden Blick, musterten seine aufgelöste Erscheinung und lächelten. Er war außer sich über dieses Lächeln. Was dachten sie sich und wie beurteilten diese Ungeängstigten die Sachlage? Es beruht auf Roheit, hätte er ihnen zuschreien mögen, Ihr Lächeln, meine Herrschaften!

The bells rang out through the fog from all the towers, and those from Sankt Marien even played “Nun dankt alle Gott” to celebrate the moment… They played it fundamentally wrong, as Hanno, raging with despair, realized, they had no idea of rhythm and were grossly defective voted ... But that was the least, the least! Yes, he was too late, it was probably no longer a question. The school clock was a little late, but he was still late, that was for sure. He stared into the faces of people who passed him. They went to their offices and to their business, they were in no great hurry and nothing threatened them.

They rang through the fog from all the steeples, and to celebrate the occasion, those of St. Mary’s were even playing “Now thank we all our God.” And playing it off key, Hanno noticed in his mad despair, without any sense of rhythm, and very badly out of tune. But that was the least of his problems, the least! Yes, he would be late, there was no question of that now. The school clock was a little slow, but he would be late all the same, that was certain. He stared people in the eye as they passed. They were on their way to their offices and shops, not in all that much of a hurry, nothing was threatening them. Some of them returned his envious, plaintive gaze, studied his disheveled appearance—and smiled. Those smiles drove him to distraction. What were they thinking? How could people with no worries possibly judge his situation? “ Pure callousness,” he wanted to shout at them. “I mean your smiles, gentlemen. Perhaps you would enjoy collapsing dead in front of the closed school gates.”","The Castle Gate--wily the Castle Gate--and it was four minutes to eight! As he panted un through the streets, in an extremity of mingled pain, perspiration, and nausea, he looked on all sides for his fellow pupils.

Buchenwaldungen kamen in Sicht, der Wagen fuhr durch den Ort, über das Marktplätzchen mit seinem Ziehbrunnen, gelangte wieder ins Freie, rollte über die Brücke, die über das Flüßchen Au führt und hielt endlich vor dem einstöckigen Wirtshaus »Zum Riesebusch«. Dies war an der einen Seite eines flachen Platzes mit Grasflächen, sandigen Wegen und ländlichen Beeten gelegen, und jenseits dieses Platzes erhob sich amphitheatralisch aufsteigend der Wald.

The individual steps were connected by rough staircases, for which high tree roots and protruding rocks had been used, and on the floors, between the trees, were set up white-painted tables, benches and chairs.","They were in the Duchy of Oldenburg now. They could see groves of beech in the distance. They drove into the village, passing through the little market square with its fountain, and then back out into the countryside, and after rolling over the bridge across the little Au River, they finally halted at the Riesebusch, a low, one-story inn, flanked on one side by a level lawn with sandy paths and rustic flower beds, behind which rose an amphitheater of woods. Crude sets of stairs formed from protruding roots and jutting rocks led from one tier to the next, and at each level white wooden tables, benches, and chairs were set out among the trees.","They were in Oldenberg.

Fräulein Meyer-de la Grange aber zog die hübschen Brauen empor und fragte:,"""Now look at this Krischan Buddenbrook!"" screamed Consul Dohlmann with his broad accent. But Miss Meyer-de la Grange raised her pretty eyebrows and asked:","“Damned if it ain’t Krischan Buddenbrook!” Consul Döhlmann exclaimed in his thick Plattdeutsch.

"Mumme versank. Er sah aus wie das Unglück, und es gab in diesem Augenblicke niemanden im Zimmer, der ihn nicht verachtet hätte. Abermals stieg ein Widerwille, eine Art von Brechreiz in Hanno Buddenbrook auf und schnürte ihm die Kehle zusammen. Gleichzeitig aber beobachtete er mit entsetzlicher Klarheit, was vor sich ging. Doktor Mantelsack malte heftig ein Zeichen von böser Bedeutung hinter Mummes Namen und sah sich dann mit finsteren Brauen in seinem Notizbuch um. Aus Zorn ging er zur Tagesordnung über, sah nach, wer eigentlich an der Reihe war, es war klar! Und als Hanno von dieser Erkenntnis gerade gänzlich überwältigt war, hörte er auch schon seinen Namen, hörte ihn wie in einem bösen Traum.","Mumme sank. He looked like misfortune, and at that moment there was nobody in the room who didn't despise him. Again a disgust, a kind of nausea rose in Hanno Buddenbrook and made his throat tight. At the same time, however, he observed what was happening with terrifying clarity. Dr. Mantelsack vigorously drew a sign of evil meaning behind Vimes' name, then scowled at his notebook. Out of anger he went back to business as usual, checked whose turn it was, it was clear! And just as Hanno was completely overwhelmed by this realization, he heard his name as if in a bad dream.","Mumme foundered and went under. He looked like calamity personified, and at that moment there was no one in the room who did not despise him. But once again Hanno Buddenbrook felt something rebel inside him, sensed a queasiness that made his throat contract. At the same time, however, he realized with terrible clarity what was happening now. With a flourish, Dr. Mantelsack made a mark fraught with doom next to Mumme’s name and scowled as he paged through his notebook. It was only too clear—in his wrath, he had decided to go back to the regular order and was checking whose turn it actually was. And as Hanno sat there overwhelmed by this realization, he heard his name called—it was like a bad dream.","Mum me was overwhelmed. He looked the child of calam-ity, and at this moment everybody in the room despised him.

Dr. Mantelsack made a mark of sinister meaning after Mumme's name, and then looked through his notebook with frowning brows. He went over, in his disgust, to the order of the day, and looked to see whose turn it really was. There was no doubt that this was the case: and just as Hanno was over-powered by this knowledge, he heard his name--as if in a bad dream."
"Frau Schwarzkopf und ihr Sohn standen in der Tür; die erstere ahnungslos, mit dem Ordnen ihrer Schürze beschäftigt, Morten mit der Miene eines verstockten Sünders … Herr Grünlich hatte sich bei ihrem Eintritt keineswegs erhoben; er verharrte in gerader und ruhevoller Haltung fest in seinen Ülster geknöpft auf der Sofakante.","Frau Schwarzkopf and her son were standing in the doorway; the former unsuspecting, busy arranging her apron, Morten with the air of a stubborn sinner ...

"Der Tisch im Eßsaale vergrößerte sich noch mehr, und Tony erhielt neue Gelegenheit, sich auszusprechen, als Thomas im August dieses Jahres von Pau nach Hause zurückkehrte.

"Mit dem Tode des Konsuls Johann Buddenbrook war das gesellschaftliche Leben in der Mengstraße erloschen, und die Konsulin sah, abgesehen von dem Besuche dieses oder jenes Geistlichen, keine anderen Gäste mehr um sich als am Donnerstag die Glieder ihrer Familie. Ihr Sohn aber und seine Gattin hatten bereits ihr erstes Diner hinter sich, ein Diner, bei dem im Speise- und Wohnzimmer gedeckt worden war, ein Diner mit Kochfrau, Lohndienern und Kistenmakerschen Weinen, eine Mittagsgesellschaft, die um fünf Uhr begonnen, und deren Gerüche und Geräusche um elf Uhr noch fortgeherrscht hatten, bei der alle Langhals', Hagenströms, Huneus', Kistenmakers, Överdiecks und Möllendorpfs zugegen gewesen waren, Kaufleute und Gelehrte, Ehepaare und Suitiers, die mit Whist und ein paar Ohren voll Musik geschlossen hatte, und von der man an der Börse noch acht Tage lang in den lobendsten Ausdrücken sprach. Wahrhaftig, es hatte sich gezeigt, daß die junge Frau Konsulin zu repräsentieren verstand … Der Konsul hatte an jenem Abend, allein geblieben mit ihr in den von hinabgebrannten Kerzen erleuchteten Räumen, zwischen den durcheinandergerückten Möbeln, in dem dichten, süßen und schweren Dunst von feinen Speisen, Parfüms, Weinen, Kaffee, Zigarren und den Blumen der Toiletten und Tafelaufsätze, ihre Hände gedrückt und gesagt: »Sehr brav, Gerda! Wir haben uns nicht zu schämen brauchen. Dergleichen ist sehr wichtig … Ich habe gar keine Lust, mich viel mit Bällen abzugeben und die jungen Leute hier umherspringen zu lassen; dazu reicht auch der Raum nicht. Aber den gesetzten Leuten muß es schmecken bei uns. So ein Diner kostet ein wenig mehr … aber das ist nicht übel angelegt.«","With the death of Consul Johann Buddenbrook, social life in Mengstrasse came to an end, and apart from visits from this or that clergyman, the Consul saw no other guests around than the members of her family on Thursday. But her son and his wife had already had their first dinner, a dinner at which the dining room and living room had been set, a dinner with the cook's wife, hired servants and the crate-maker's wines, a midday party that began at five o'clock, and their smells and noises had still prevailed at eleven o'clock, at which all the Langhals, Hagenstroms, Huneus, Kistenmakers, Överdiecks and Möllendorpfs had been present, merchants and scholars, married couples and suitiers, who had closed with whist and a few ears full of music, and which was talked about in the most praising terms on the stock exchange for another eight days. Truly, it had been shown that the young woman knew how to represent the consul... That evening, the consul had stayed alone with her in the rooms lit by the candles that had burned down, among the jumbled furniture, in the dense, sweet and heavy haze of fine Food, perfumes, wines, coffee, cigars and the flowers of the toilets and centerpieces, squeezing her hands and saying: ""Very good, Gerda! We didn't need to be ashamed. That sort of thing is very important...I don't want to mess around with balls and let the young people jump around here; there is not enough space for that. But the settled people must like it here with us. A dinner like that costs a little more… but that's not a bad investment.”","With the death of Johann Buddenbrook, normal social life had also died on Meng Strasse, and apart from the visit of an occasional clergyman Elisabeth entertained no guests other than the members of her family, who gathered on Thursday evenings. Her son, however, and his wife already had their first dinner party behind them, with tables set in both the dining and sitting rooms, with cook, footmen, and wine from Kistenmaker’s—an affair that began at five in the evening, with odors and sounds still lingering when the clock struck eleven. All the Langhalses, Hagenströms, Huneuses, Kistenmakers, Oeverdiecks, and Möllendorpfs—whether business or professional men, couples or suitiers—had attended the party, which concluded with whist and several earfuls of music and was praised in the highest terms on the exchange for a good week afterward. And it was more than evident that the consul’s young wife knew how to entertain in style. That same evening, as they stood alone in the sitting room by the dim light of candles burning low now among furniture shoved this way and that—and enveloped in the sweet, heavy, thick odor of fine foods, perfumes, wines, coffee, cigars, and flowers that had adorned both the ladies and the tables—the consul squeezed her hands and said, “Well done, Gerda. We certainly have nothing to be ashamed of. This sort of thing is important. I have no great desire to throw a ball and have young people leaping around in here— there’s not room enough, anyway. But the more staid and settled folks should eat well at our table. A dinner like this costs a little more, but it’s money well invested.”","The social life of Meng Street had been extinguished with the death of Consul Johann Buddenbrook. Except for the visits of this or that man of God, the Frau Consul saw no guests but the members of her family, who still came on Thursday afternoons. But the first great dinner had already been given by the young pair in Broad Street. Tables were laid in both dining- and living-room, and there were a hired cook and waiters and Kistenmaker wines. It began at five o'clock, and its sounds and smells were still in the air at eleven. All the business and professional men were present, 305 BUDDENBRO DKS married pairs and bachelors as well: all the tribe of Langhals, Hag en stroms, Huneus', Kistenmakers, Overdiecks, and Mol-lendorpfs. It finished off with whist and music. They talked about it in glowing terms on the Bourse for a whole week. The young Frau Consul certainly knew how to entertain! When she and the Consul were alone, in the room lighted by burned-down candles, with the furniture disarranged and the air thick with heavy odours of rich food, wine, cigars, coffee, perfume, and the scent of the flowers from the ladies' toilettes and the table decorations, he pressed her hand and said: ""Very good, Gerda. We do not need to be ashamed. This sort of thing is necessary. I have no great fondness for balls, and having the young people jumping about here; and, be-sides, there is not room. But we must entertain the settled people. A dinner like that costs a bit more--but it is well spent."""

"Therese Weichbrodt war bucklig, sie war so bucklig, daß sie nicht viel höher war als ein Tisch.

Aber wundern muß ich mich doch, daß Mutter mit dem Amte nicht jemanden betraut hat, der mir nähersteht und mir brüderlicher zugetan ist als du …« Christian war nun ganz und gar außer sich; er fing an, Dinge zu sagen, wie er sie noch niemals hatte laut werden lassen. Er hatte sich über den Tisch gebeugt, pochte unaufhörlich mit der Spitze des gekrümmten Zeigefingers auf die Platte und starrte mit gesträubtem Schnurrbart und geröteten Augen zu seinem Bruder empor, der seinerseits aufrecht, bleich und mit halb gesenkten Lidern auf ihn hinabblickte.","'Well, you yourself will probably know best who caused mother to take this measure. But I have to be surprised that mother didn't entrust the office to someone who is closer to me and more brotherly to me than you...'

"»I donk scheen, Herr Nachbohr!« sagte Herr Permaneder kauend und merkte nichts von dem entsetzten Blick, den Mamsell Jungmann ihm zuwarf. Von dem Porter aber genoß er mit solcher Zurückhaltung, daß die Konsulin eine Bouteille Rotwein heraufkommen ließ, worauf er merklich munterer wurde und wieder mit Frau Grünlich zu plaudern begann. Er saß, des Bauches wegen, ziemlich weit vom Tische entfernt, hielt seine Beine weit voneinander entfernt und ließ meistens den einen seiner kurzen Arme mit der feisten, weißen Hand senkrecht an der Stuhllehne hinunterhängen, während er, den dicken Kopf mit dem Seehundsschnurrbart ein wenig zur Seite gelegt, mit dem Ausdruck einer verdrießlichen Behaglichkeit und einem treuherzigen Blinzeln seiner Augenritzen, Tonys Reden und Antworten anhörte.","""I don't care, Herr Nachbohr!"" said Herr Permaneder, chewing, and didn't notice the horrified look Mamsell Jungmann gave him. But he enjoyed the porter with such reticence that the Consul brought up a bottle of red wine, whereupon he became noticeably more cheerful and began chatting with Frau Grünlich again. Because of his stomach he sat quite far away from the table, kept his legs wide apart and usually let one of his short arms with his plump, white hand hang down vertically on the back of the chair, while he, his thick head with the seal's mustache a little laid to one side, listening to Tony's speeches and replies with an expression of sullen complacency and a candid blink of the chinks in his eyes.","“Thanks heaps, neighbor,” Herr Permaneder said, chewing away, not even noticing the shocked look on Mamselle Jungmann’s face. He was obviously only sipping at his porter, and so Madame Buddenbrook had a bottle of red wine brought in—which visibly cheered him up; and he began again to chat with Frau Grünlich. His paunch forced him to sit at some distance from the table with his legs spread wide, and most of the time he dangled one stout white hand at the end of its short arm over the back of his chair. The expression on his walrus face said that he was very much at home, almost annoyingly so. He had laid his round head to one side, and his guileless eyes sparkled in their little slits as he listened to everything Frau Grünlich said.","""Thank you kindly, neighbour,"" said Herr Permaneder, quite unaware of the outraged look Mams ell Jungmann cast at him. But he drank so moderately of the porter that the Frau Consul had a bottle of red wine brought up; whereat he grew visibly gayer and began to talk with Frau Gr�nlich again. He sat, on account of his prominent stomach, well away from the table, with his legs far apart, and one of his arms, with the plump white hand, hanging down over the chair-back. He put his round head with its walrus moustache on one side and blinked out of the cracks of his eyes naively as he listened to Tony's conversation. He looked offensively comfortable."
"Und dann erhob sich die Konsulin. Sie ergriff die Hand ihres Enkels Johann und die ihrer Urenkelin Elisabeth und schritt durch das Zimmer. Die alten Herrschaften schlossen sich an, die jüngeren folgten, in der Säulenhalle gesellten sich die Dienstboten und die Hausarmen hinzu, und während alles einmütig »O Tannebaum« anstimmte und Onkel Christian vorn die Kinder zum Lachen brachte, indem er beim Marschieren die Beine hob wie ein Hampelmann und albernerweise »O Tantebaum« sang, zog man mit geblendeten Augen und ein Lächeln auf dem Gesicht durch die weitgeöffnete hohe Flügeltür direkt in den Himmel hinein.","And then the Consul rose. She took the hand of her grandson Johann and that of her great-granddaughter Elisabeth and walked across the room. The old gentlemen followed, the younger ones followed, in the columned hall the servants and the house poor joined them, and while everyone chanted ""O Tannebaum"" in unison and Uncle Christian in front made the children laugh by raising his legs as he marched like a jumping jack and sillyly singing ""O Tantebaum,"" you were drawn through the wide-open, tall double doors straight into the sky with dazzled eyes and a smile on your face.","And now old Madame Buddenbrook stood up. She grasped the hands of her grandson, Johann, and her great-granddaughter, Elisabeth, and strode across the room. The older ladies and gentlemen closed ranks behind her, the younger ones followed and were joined in the columned hall by the servants and the “poor,” and they all lifted their voices in “O, Tannenbaum”—and Uncle Christian made the children laugh by lifting his legs like a funny, marching marionette and singing the silly words “Oh, Tinny Boom.” And, with every eye sparkling and a smile on every face, they marched through the wide-open folding doors into heaven.","Now the Frau Consul rose. She grasped the hands of her grandson Johann and her granddaughter Elisabeth, and pro-ceeded through the room.

"Erst als das Ehepaar Permaneder bereits einige Wochen in München lebte, hatte Konsul Buddenbrook die testamentarisch fixierte Mitgift seiner Schwester, das heißt 51000 Mark Kurant, flüssig machen können, und diese Summe war hierauf, in Gulden umgesetzt vollkommen richtig in Herrn Permaneders Hände gelangt. Herr Permaneder hatte sie sicher und nicht ungünstig deponiert. Was er aber dann, ohne Zögern und Erröten, seiner Gattin gesagt hatte, war dies: »Tonerl« – er nannte sie Tonerl – »Tonerl, mir war's gnua. Mehr brauchen mer nimmer.

Herr Permaneder had deposited them safely and not unfavorably. But what he then said to his wife, without hesitation or blushing, was this: ""Tonerl"" - he called her Tonerl - ""Tonerl, I didn't care. We never need more. I've always abused me, and now I want my rest, Himmi Sacrament. We rent the ground floor and the second floor, and here we have a good apartment and we can eat a knuckle of pork and we don't always need to get together and bang on... and in the evening I have the Hofbräuhaus. I'm not a percentage and I don't like to scrounge around a gold all the time; I like my comfort! From tomorrow on I'll quit and go private!""","The Permaneders had been living together in Munich as man and wife for several weeks when Consul Buddenbrook finally was able to convert into cash the amount specified in his father’s will for his sister’s dowry, a total of fifty-one thousand marks courant, which sum was then converted into guldens and was received intact by Herr Permaneder, who then transferred it to secure and profitable investments. But then, without the least hesitation or embarrassment, he had turned to his wife and said, “Tony gal”—he called her “Tony gal”—“Tony gal, that’ll do it. We don’t need nothin’ more. I’ve plugged away all my life, and now I want my peace ’n’ quiet. Damn if I don’t. We’ll rent out the ground floor, and the third floor, and we’ve got ourselves a nice ’partment here, ’n’ we can eat our ham hocks ’n’ don’t need all the rest of the fancy fiddle-faddle. And I can spend my evenin’s at the Hofbräuhaus. I’m not much for puttin’ on the dog or scrimpin’ and sockin’ away the money. I want to take things easy. So, startin’ t’morrow mornin’ , I’m callin’ it quits. I’m retirin’.”","Not until after the Permaneder couple had been some weeks in Munich had Consul Buddenbrook liquidated the sum fixed by his Father's will as his sister's second marriage portion. That sum, translated into gulden, had at last safely reached Herr Permaneder's hands, and Herr Permaneder had 361 invested it securely and not unprofitably. But then, what he had said, quite unblushingly and without embarrassment, to his wife, was this: ""Tonerl""--he called her ""Tonerl""--""Tonerl, that's good enough for me. What do we want of more? I been working my hide off all my days; now I'd like to sit down and have a little peace and quiet, damned if I wouldn't. Let's rent the parterre and the second floor, and still we'll have a good house, where we can sit and eat our bit of pig's meat without screwing ourselves up anil putting on so much lug. And in the evening I can go to the Hofbrau house. I'm no swell--I don't care about scraping money to-gether. I want my comfort. I quit to-morrow and go into private life."""

What might that mean? Probably only Ida Jungmann, Tony's governess and year-long confi-dante, knew that. Ida would say, ""Tony, my child, you will see: he'll rome."""
"Und der zweite Pate? Es ist dieser schneeweiße, würdige, alte Herr, der hier mit seiner hohen Halsbinde und seinem weichen, schwarzen Tuchrock, aus dessen hinterer Tasche stets der Zipfel eines roten Schnupftuches hervorhängt, sich in dem bequemsten Lehnstuhl über seinen Krückstock beugt: Bürgermeister Doktor Överdieck. Es ist ein Ereignis, ein Sieg! Manche Leute begreifen nicht, wie es zugegangen ist. Guter Gott, es ist doch kaum eine Verwandtschaft! Die Buddenbrooks haben den Alten an den Haaren herbeigezogen … Und in der Tat: es ist ein Streich, eine kleine Intrige, die der Konsul zusammen mit Mme. Permaneder eingefädelt hat. Eigentlich, in der ersten Freude, als Mutter und Kind in Sicherheit waren, ist es bloß ein Scherz gewesen. »Ein Junge, Tony! – Der soll den Bürgermeister zum Gevatter haben!« hat der Konsul gerufen; aber sie hat es aufgegriffen und ist mit Ernst darauf eingegangen, worauf auch er sich die Sache wohl überlegt und dann in einen Versuch gewilligt hat. So haben sie sich hinter Onkel Justus gesteckt, der seine Frau zu ihrer Schwägerin, der Gattin des Holzhändlers Överdieck, geschickt hat, die ihrerseits ihren greisen Schwiegervater ein wenig hat präparieren müssen. Dann hat ein ehrerbietiger Besuch Thomas Buddenbrooks bei dem Staatsoberhaupte das Seine getan …","And the second godfather? It is this snow-white, dignified old gentleman, with his high necktie and his soft, black cloth coat, from the back pocket of which the corner of a red handkerchief always hangs, bending over his cane in the most comfortable armchair: Mayor Doctor Överdieck. It's an event, a victory! Some people don't understand how it happened. Good God, it's hardly a relationship! The Buddenbrooks pulled the old man by the hair... And indeed: it's a prank, a little intrigue that the Consul engineered together with Mme. Permaneder. Actually, in the first joy when mother and child were safe, it was just a joke. 'A boy, Tony! ""He's supposed to have the mayor for his godfather!"" cried the consul; but she picked it up and went into it seriously, which made him think it over carefully and then agree to try it. So they threw themselves behind Uncle Justus, who sent his wife to her sister-in-law, the wife of the timber merchant Överdieck, who in turn had to do a little grooming for her aged father-in-law. Then a respectful visit by Thomas Buddenbrooks to the head of state did its part...","And the second godparent? It is this dignified old gentleman with snow-white hair, who is sitting in the most comfortable armchair, bent down over his cane and wearing a high neckband and a soft, black cloth coat with the tip of a red handkerchief peeking, as always, from its back pocket—it is Mayor Oeverdieck. What a coup, what a triumph! A great many people cannot understand how it was accomplished—good God, they were hardly related. The Buddenbrooks must have dragged the old man in by the hair. And, indeed, it was the result of a plot, a little scheme contrived by Madame Permaneder and the consul. Actually, it was only a joke at first, born out of the joy that both mother and child were safe and well. “It’s a boy, Tony! He should have the mayor for his godfather,” the consul shouted; but Tony picked up on the idea and developed it in earnest, and after due consideration Tom agreed to make the attempt. And so they hid behind Uncle Justus, who sent his wife to see her sister-in-law, who was the wife of Oeverdieck the lumber merchant, whose job it was to soften up her aged father-in-law. And then Thomas Buddenbrook did his part and paid a reverential visit to the head of state.","And the second god-father? It is this dignified old gentle-man with the snow-white hair, high neck-band, and soft black broadcloth coat with the red handkerchief sticking out of the back pocket, sitting here bent over his stick, in the most comfortable arm-chair in the house. It is, of course, Burgo-master Dr. Overdieck. It is a great event--a triumph! Good heavens, how could it have come about? he is hardly even a relative! The Buddenbrooks must have dragged the old man in by the hair! In fact, it is rather a feat: a little intrigue planned by the Consul and Madame Permaneder. At first it was merely a joke, born of the great relief of knowing that mother and child were safe. "" A boy, Tony,"" cried the Con-s'ul. "" He ought to have the Burgomaster for god-father!"" But she took it up in earnest, whereupon he considered the matter seriously and agreed to make a trial. They hid be-hind Uncle Justus, and got him to send his wife ta her sister-in-law, the wife of Ovcrdieck the lumber dealer. She ac-cepted the task of preparing the old father-in-law; then Thomas Buddenbrook made a visit to the head of the state and paid his respects--and the thing was done."

"»Ich … sehe mich veranlaßt, Ihnen zu eröffnen«, fuhr er mit leichthin trällernder Betonung fort, indem seine Augen mit ungeheurer Aufmerksamkeit von einem Punkt des Zimmers auf einen anderen und dann zum Fenster sprangen, »daß ich vor einiger Zeit um die Hand eben dieser Demoiselle Buddenbrook angehalten habe, daß ich mich im vollen Besitz der beiderseitigen elterlichen Zustimmung befinde, und daß das Fräulein selbst mir, ohne daß zwar die Verlobung bereits in aller Form stattgefunden hätte, mit unzweideutigen Worten Anrechte auf ihre Hand gegeben hat.«","'I this Demoiselle Buddenbrook, that I am in full possession of the parental consent of both parties, and that the young lady herself, although the engagement had not yet taken place in any formal way, gave me in unequivocal terms rights to her hand.""","“I … find myself constrained to reveal to you”—his voice took on a casual lilt now, and his eyes wandered about the room, fixing briefly with great attention on each point before taking a final leap to the window—“that some time ago I asked for the hand of Demoiselle Buddenbrook in marriage, that I possess the fullest consent of both parental parties, and that, although a formal betrothal has not yet taken place, the young lady has acknowledged in unambiguous terms my claim to her hand.”","""I am obliged to inform you,"" he went on in a sing-song tone, his sharp eyes jumping from one point in the room to another and then to the window, ""that some time ago I pro-posed for the hand of Mademoiselle Buddenbrook.

"Dieser Paroxysmus von Entrüstung entsprach nicht den Umständen! Nein, es waren nicht diese 127500 Kurantmark, die ihn in einen Zustand versetzten, wie ihn noch niemals irgend jemand an ihm beobachtet hatte! Es war vielmehr dies, daß in seinem vorher schon gereizten Empfinden sich auch dieser Fall noch der Kette von Niederlagen und Demütigungen anreihte, die er während der letzten Monate im Geschäft und in der Stadt hatte erfahren müssen … Nichts fügte sich mehr! Nichts ging mehr nach seinem Willen! War es so weit gekommen, daß man im Hause seiner Väter in den wichtigsten Angelegenheiten »über ihn hinwegging« …? Daß ein Rigaer Pastor ihn rücklings übertölpelte?… Er hätte es verhindern können, aber sein Einfluß war gar nicht erprobt worden! Die Ereignisse waren ohne ihn ihren Gang gegangen! Aber ihm schien, daß das früher nicht hätte geschehen können, daß es früher nicht gewagt haben würde, zu geschehen! Es war eine neue Erschütterung des eigenen Glaubens an sein Glück, seine Macht, seine Zukunft … Und es war nichts als seine innere Schwäche und Verzweiflung, die vor Mutter und Schwester während dieses Auftrittes hervorbrach.","This paroxysm of indignation did not correspond to the circumstances! No, it wasn't these 127,500 Kurantmarks that put him in a condition that no one had ever observed in him! Rather, it was that in his already irritated feeling, this case also added to the chain of defeats and humiliations that he had had to experience during the last few months in the shop and in the city... Nothing worked out! Nothing went according to his will! Had it gotten to the point that in the house of his fathers he was ""ignored"" in the most important matters...? That a Riga pastor duped him from behind?... He could have prevented it, but his influence had not been tested! Events had taken their course without him! But it seemed to him that this could not have happened before, that it would not have dared to happen before! It was a new shaking of one's belief in his happiness, his power, his future... And it was nothing but his inner weakness and desperation that erupted in front of his mother and sister during this performance.","This paroxysm of fury was out of proportion to the real circumstances. No, it wasn’t the 127,500 marks courant that had reduced him to a state in which no one had ever seen him before. It was, rather, that, given his general irritable mood, this was the last link in a chain of defeats and humiliations to which he had been subjected in his business and in civic affairs over the last few months. Nothing was going right. Nothing was turning out the way he wanted. Had things gone so far now that, when it came to the most crucial matters, people simply “went right over his head,” here in the house of his forefathers? That a pastor from Riga could swindle him behind his back? He could have prevented it, but his influence had not even been put to the test. Events had taken their course without him. But it seemed to him that this sort of thing could not have happened in the past, that it would not have dared happen in the past. It was another shock to his faith in his own good fortune, his authority, his future. And it was nothing more than his own inner weakness and desperation that erupted here in this scene with his mother and sister.","This paroxysm of anger was out of proportion to the cir-cumstances, No, it was not the hundred and twenty-seven thousand marks that had brought him to this unprecedented state of rage. It was rather that his irritated senses con-nected this case with the series of rebuffs and misfortunes which had lately attended him in both public and private 43 BUDDENBRDDK5 business. Nothing went well any more, Nothing turned out as he intended it should. And now, had it come to this, that in the house of his fathers they ""went over his head"" in mat-ters of the highest importance? That a pastor from Riga could thus bamboozle him behind his bark? He could have prevented it if he had only been told! But events had taken their course without him. It was this which he felt could not have happened earlier--would not have dared to happen earlier! Again his faith tottered--his faith in himself, his luck, his power, his future. And it was nothing but his own inward weakness and despair that broke out in this scene before mother and sister."

"»Oh, richtig, Sie sind Hopfenhändler, mein lieber Herr Permaneder! Noppe & Comp., nicht wahr? Seien Sie überzeugt, ich habe von meinem Sohne, dem Konsul, hie und da viel Vorteilhaftes über Ihre Firma gehört«, sagte die Konsulin höflich. Aber Herr Permaneder wehrte ab: »Is scho recht.

Ah, well, the main thing is that I always had the wish to pay my respects to your dear lady and to see Frau Grünlich again! Dos is Sach' gnua, to shy away from the trip!""","“Oh, right, you are in hops, Herr Permaneder. Noppe & Co., is that right? I can assure you that I’ve heard many good things about your firm from my son the consul,” Madame Buddenbrook said politely. But Herr Permaneder brushed this aside. “ ’tain’t nothin’ worth mentionin’. Main thing is, I been hank’rin’ to pay my respects to you, lovely lady, and to see Frau Grünlich again. That’s reason ’nuff to set out on such a long haul.”","""Dh, yes--you are hop merchants, of course, my dear Herr Pprmaneder: Noppe and Company, isn't it? I am sure I have heard good things of your firm from my son,"" said the' Frau Consul cordially. Again she felt as if she were almost upon firm ground. Herr Permaneder waved away the compliment. That was nothing to mention. No, the main thing was, he wanted to pay his respects to the Frau Consul 325 and --see Frau Sriinlich again. That was enough to make the journey repay the trouble it cost."
"»Ich glaube, ja«, sagte er. »Deine ernste und wichtige Angelegenheit scheint mir auf einen Vorschuß auf die Pöppenrader Ernte hinauszulaufen, wenn ich nicht irre? Aber da habt ihr euch, du und deine Freunde, nicht an den richtigen Mann gewandt, wie mich dünkt. Erstens nämlich habe ich noch niemals ein Geschäft mit Herrn von Maiboom gemacht, und dies wäre denn doch wohl eine ziemlich sonderbare Anknüpfung von Beziehungen. Zweitens haben wir, Urgroßvater, Großvater, Vater und ich, wohl hie und da den Landleuten Vorschüsse gezahlt, wenn anders sie durch ihre Persönlichkeit und sonstigen Verhältnisse eine gewisse Sicherheit boten … Wie du selbst mir aber vor zwei Minuten Herrn von Maibooms Persönlichkeit und Verhältnisse charakterisiert hast, kann doch von solcher Sicherheit hier kaum die Rede sein …«","""I think so,"" he said. ""Your serious and important matter seems to amount to an advance on the Poppenrader harvest, if I'm not mistaken? But you and your friends didn't turn to the right man, as I think. In the first place, I have never done business with Herr von Maiboom, and that would be a rather strange connection. Secondly, we, great-grandfather, grandfather, father and I, have paid advances to the country people here and there, if otherwise they offered a certain security through their personality and other circumstances ... As you yourself characterized Herr von Maiboom's personality and circumstances two minutes ago there can hardly be any talk of such security here...""","“I think I see, yes,” he said. “Your serious and important matter appears to come down to some sort of advance on the harvest at Pöppenrade, if I’m not mistaken. But I’m afraid that you, and your friends, have approached the wrong man. First, I’ve never done business with Herr von Maiboom before, and this would be a rather curious way to strike up a relationship. Second, although there have been occasions over the years when we—Great-grandfather, Grandfather, Father, and I—have provided advances to some of the landed gentry, we did so only if their character or other circumstances guaranteed us a certain security. But as you yourself described Herr von Maiboom’s character and circumstances not two minutes ago, any such guarantees are out of the question in this case.”","""I think so,"" he said. ""Your serious and important busi-ness evidently concerns an advance on the Poppenrade har-vest--if I am not mistaken. But you have come to the wrong man, I think, you and your friends. In the first plane, I have never done any business with Herr von Maiboom, and this would be a rather strange way to begin. In the second place--though, in the past, Grandfather, Father, and I my-self have made advances on occasion to the landed gentry, it was always when they offered a certain security, either per-sonally or through their connections. But to judge from the way you have just characterized Herr von Maiboom and his prospects, I should say there can be nu security in his case."""
"Beim Weggehen aber, schon in der Tür, wendet Frau Permaneder sich noch einmal um. Sie kehrt zu ihrem Bruder zurück, küßt ihn auf beide Wangen und sagt: »Das ist ein schöner Tag, Tom, ich bin so glücklich, wie seit manchem Jahr nicht mehr!

Jetzt, wo der kleine Johann da ist – es ist so schön, daß wir ihn wieder Johann genannt haben – jetzt ist mir, als ob noch einmal eine ganz neue Zeit kommen muß!«","But as she leaves, already in the doorway, Frau Permaneder turns around again. She returns to her brother, kisses him on both cheeks and says, ""It's a beautiful day, Tom, I'm happier than I've been in a year! We Buddenbrooks aren't on our last legs yet, thank God, whoever believes that is very much mistaken! Now that little Johann is here - it's so nice that we called him Johann again - now I feel as if a whole new era must come again!""","As they are leaving, however, and still standing in the doorway, Frau Permaneder turns around once more.

»Meine liebe Tony!,'My dear Tony!,"My dear Tony,","MY DEAR TONY,"
"Dann stand er, zwischen Schwester und Schwägerin, am Sterbebette. Er stand dort, mit seinem kahlen Schädel, seinen eingefallenen Wangen, seinem hängenden Schnurrbart und seiner ungeheuren, gehöckerten Nase, auf krummen und mageren Beinen, ein wenig geknickt, ein wenig fragezeichenartig, und seine kleinen, tiefliegenden Augen blickten in des Bruders Gesicht, das so schweigsam, kalt, ablehnend und einwandfrei, so sehr jedem menschlichen Urteil unzugänglich erschien … Thomas' Mundwinkel waren mit beinahe verächtlichem Ausdruck nach unten gezogen. Er, dem Christian vorgeworfen hatte, daß er bei seinem Tode nicht weinen werde, er war seinerseits tot, er war ohne ein Wort zu sagen ganz einfach gestorben, hatte sich vornehm und intakt ins Schweigen zurückgezogen und überließ den andern mitleidlos der Beschämung, wie so oft im Leben! Hatte er nun gut oder schnöde gehandelt, indem er den Leiden Christians, seiner »Qual«, dem nickenden Manne, der Spiritusflasche, dem offenen Fenster, stets nur kalte Verachtung entgegengesetzt hatte? Diese Frage fiel dahin, sie war sinnlos geworden, da der Tod in eigensinniger und unberechenbarer Parteilichkeit ihn, ihn ausgezeichnet und gerechtfertigt, ihn angenommen und aufgenommen, ihn ehrwürdig gemacht und ihm befehlshaberisch das allgemeine, scheue Interesse verschafft hatte, während er Christian verschmähte und nur fortfahren würde, ihn mit fünfzig Mätzchen und Schikanen zu hänseln, vor denen niemand Respekt hatte. Nie hatte Thomas Buddenbrook seinem Bruder mehr imponiert, als zu dieser Stunde. Der Erfolg ist ausschlaggebend. Der anderen Achtung vor unseren Leiden verschafft uns nur der Tod, und auch die kläglichsten Leiden werden ehrwürdig durch ihn. Du hast recht bekommen, ich beuge mich, dachte Christian, und mit einer raschen, unbeholfenen Bewegung ließ er sich auf ein Knie nieder und küßte die kalte Hand auf der Steppdecke. Dann trat er zurück und begann mit schweifenden Augen im Zimmer umherzugehen.","Then he stood between his sister and sister-in-law on his deathbed. He stood there, with his bald head, his sunken cheeks, his drooping mustache and his enormous humped nose, on crooked and lean legs, a little kinked, a little like a question mark, and his small, deep-set eyes looked into his brother's face, the so taciturn, cold, dismissive, and impeccable, so impervious to any human judgment... Thomas's mouth was drawn down in an almost contemptuous expression. He, whom Christian had reproached for not crying when he died, was dead himself, he had simply died without saying a word, had withdrawn into silence, noble and intact, leaving the others pitilessly to shame, like so often in life! Had he acted well or badly by always showing only cold contempt for Christian's suffering, his ""torment,"" the nodding man, the spirit bottle, the open window? This question fell away, it had become meaningless, since death, with obstinate and unpredictable partiality, had honored and justified him, accepted and received him, made him venerable and commandingly given him the general, shy interest, while he despised Christian and only would go on teasing him with fifty antics and harassment that no one had any respect for. Thomas Buddenbrook had never impressed his brother more than at this hour. Success is key. Only death gives us respect for our sufferings, and even the most pitiful sufferings become venerable through it. You were right, I'll bend, thought Christian, and with a quick, awkward movement he got down on one knee and kissed the cold hand on the quilt. Then he stepped back and began pacing the room, eyes wandering.","There he stood beside the deathbed, between his sister and sister-in-law—stood there with his bald head, sunken cheeks, drooping mustache, and immense hooked nose. He stood there on bowed legs, bent in a kind of question mark, and his little, deep-set eyes gazed at his brother’s face—and it was so silent, cold, dismissive, and impeccable, so totally beyond all human reproach. The corners of Thomas’s mouth were drawn down, lending him an almost contemptuous look. The man who Christian had predicted would not weep for him when he died, now lay dead—had simply died without saying a word, had wrapped himself in elegant and unruffled silence, and, as so often before, with no sympathy for anyone else, had left them all helpless in their shame. He had always shown nothing but cold disdain for Christian’s sufferings—his “ache,” the nodding man, the methylated alcohol, the open window. Had that been fair of him, or contemptible? But the question melted away now, had become meaningless, because death, choosing sides as it always did in its willful and unpredictable fashion, had chosen and vindicated him, accepted him, taken him in, bestowed great dignity upon him, and imperiously made him the center of general if reticent interest. Whereas death had scorned Christian and would only continue to tease him with fifty little tricks and pranks that would command no one’s respect. Never had Thomas Buddenbrook so impressed his brother as at this moment. Success is everything. Only death dignifies our sufferings in the eyes of others; death exalts even the most trifling of sufferings. “You’ve won—I give up,” Christian thought, and with a quick, awkward motion he let himself down on one knee and kissed the cold hand lying on the quilt. Then he stepped back and began to pace the room, while his eyes wandered here and there.","He stood at the bedside between his sister and his sister-in-law; with his bald head, his sunken cheeks, his drooping moustaches, and his huge beaked nose, he stood there on his bertt legs, looking a little like an interrogation-point, and gazed with his little round deep eyes into his brother's face, as it lay so silent, so cold, so detached and inaccessible. The corners of Thomas's mouth were drawn down in an expres-sion almost scornful. Here he lay, at whom once Christiari had flung the reproach that he was too heartless to iveep at H brother's death. He was dead now himself: he had simply withdrawn, silent, elegant, and irreproachable, into the here-after. He had, as so often in his life, left it to others to feel put in the wrong. No matter now, whether he had been right or wrong in his cold and scornful indifference toward his brother's afflictions, the ""misery,"" the nodding man, the spirit bottle, the open window. None of that mattered now; for death, with arbitrary and incomprehensible partiality, had singled him out, and taken him up, and given him an awe-some dignity and importance. And yet Death had rejected Christian, had held him off, and would not have him at any price--would only keep on making game of him and mocking him with all these tricks and antics whirh nobody took se-riously. Never in his life had Thomas Buddenbrook so im-287 pressed his brother as at this hour. Success is so definite, so conclusive! Death alone can make others respect our sufferings; and through dea/th the most pitiable sufferings acquire dignity. ""You have won--I give in,"" Christian thought. He knelt on one knee, with a sudden awkward gesture, and kissed the cold hand on the coverlet. Thpn he stepped back and moved about the room, his eyes darting bark and forth."
"Es war der Hochsommer des Jahres vierundsiebenzig. Silberweiße, rundliche Wolken zogen am tiefblauen Himmel über die zierliche Symmetrie des Stadtgartens hin, in den Zweigen des Walnußbaumes zwitscherten die Vögel mit fragender Betonung, der Springbrunnen plätscherte inmitten des Kranzes von hohen, lilafarbenen Schwertlilien, der ihn umgab, und der Duft des Flieders vermischte sich leider mit dem Sirupgeruch, den ein warmer Luftzug von der nahen Zuckerbrennerei herübertrug. Zum Erstaunen des Personals verließ der Senator jetzt oftmals in voller Arbeitszeit das Kontor, um sich, die Hände auf dem Rücken, in seinem Garten zu ergehen, den Kies zu harken, den Schlamm vom Springbrunnen zu fischen oder einen Rosenzweig zu stützen … Sein Gesicht, mit den hellen Brauen, von denen eine ein wenig emporgezogen war, schien ernst und aufmerksam bei diesen Beschäftigungen; aber seine Gedanken gingen weit fort im Dunklen, ihre eigenen, mühseligen Pfade.","It was midsummer in the year seventy-four. Silver-white, rounded clouds moved in the deep blue sky over the delicate symmetry of the city garden, in the branches of the walnut tree the birds chirped with questioning emphasis, the fountain splashed amidst the ring of tall purple irises that surrounded it, and the scent of lilacs mingled unfortunately with the smell of syrup that a warm breeze carried over from the nearby sugar distillery. To the astonishment of the staff, the senator would now often leave the office at full time to stroll with his hands behind his back in his garden, raking the gravel, fishing the mud from the fountain, or supporting a rose branch... His face, with the light eyebrows, one of which was raised a little, seemed serious and attentive in these occupations; but his thoughts went far away in the dark, their own toilsome paths.","It was the middle of the summer of 1874. Silver-white, rounded clouds drifted in the deep blue sky above the delicate symmetry of the garden. In the branches of the walnut tree, birds were singing, their chirps ending in questions. The fountain splashed in the center of a wreath of tall, lavender-colored irises, and the scent of lilac was mixed, unfortunately, with a syrupy odor floating in on the warm breeze from a nearby sugar factory. To the amazement of his staff, the senator frequently left his office now in the middle of working hours and strolled about his garden, his hands behind his back; he would rake gravel, fish the algae from the fountain, or prune a rosebush. His face, with one pale eyebrow slightly lifted, was earnest and alert as he went about these tasks; but his thoughts were far away, following their own dark, arduous path.","It was high summer of the year 1874. Silvery, high-piled clouds drifted across the deep blue sky above the garden's dainty symmetry. The birds twittered in the boughs of the walnut tree, the fountain splashed among the irises, and the scent of the lilacs floated on the breeze, mingled, alas, with the smell of hot syrup from a sugar-factory nearby. To the astonishment of the staff, the Senator now often left his work during office hours, to pace up and down in the garden with his hands behind his back, or to work about, raking the gravel paths, tying up the rose-bushes, or dredging mud out of the fountain.

"Es war zehn Minuten vor acht Uhr, als er den Vorgarten passierte, die kleine rote Villa zurückließ und nach rechts die winterliche Allee entlang zu hasten begann … Zehn, neun, acht Minuten nur noch. Und der Weg war weit. Und man konnte vor Nebel kaum sehen, wie weit man gekommen war! Er zog ihn ein und stieß ihn wieder aus, diesen dicken, eiskalten Nebel, mit der ganzen Kraft seiner schmalen Brust, stemmte die Zunge gegen den Zahn, der vom Kakao noch brannte, und tat den Muskeln seiner Beine eine unsinnige Gewalt an. Er war in Schweiß gebadet und fühlte sich dennoch erfroren in jedem Gliede. In seinen Seiten fing es an zu stechen. Das bißchen Frühstück revoltierte in seinem Magen bei diesem Morgenspaziergang, ihm ward übel, und sein Herz war nur noch ein bebendes und haltlos flatterndes Ding, das ihm den Atem nahm.","It was ten minutes to eight o'clock when he passed the front yard, left the little red villa behind, and began hurrying to the right down the wintry avenue... Only ten, nine, eight minutes to go. And the way was long. And you could hardly see how far you had come because of the fog! He drew it in and let it out again, that thick, icy mist, with all the strength of his narrow chest, pressing his tongue against the tooth that was still stinging from the cocoa, and doing insane violence to the muscles of his legs. He was bathed in sweat and yet felt frozen in every limb. His sides began to sting. What little breakfast he had on this morning walk turned his stomach upside down, he felt nauseous, and his heart was just a quivering and unrestrainedly fluttering thing that took his breath away.","It was ten minutes before eight as he crossed the front yard, left the little red-brick villa behind, and began to hurry down the wintry street. Ten, nine, eight minutes left. And it was a long way. And in this fog you could hardly tell where you were.

What little breakfast he had eaten rebelled in his stomach, he felt nauseated, and his heart was just a quivering, wildly fluttering mass that took his breath away.","It was ten minutes to eight when he leff the garden and the little brick villa behind him and dashed along the wintry avenue. Ten, nine, eight minutes more. And it was a long way. He could scarcely see for the fog.

He was bathed in perspiration; yet he felt frozen in every limb. He began to have a stitch in his side.

"Dann und wann besuchte man den kleinen Johann, legte den Arm um seinen Matrosenkragen und nahm seine Geschenke mit der ironisch übertriebenen Bewunderung in Augenschein, mit der man die Herrlichkeiten der Kinder zu bestaunen pflegt.

"Dann und wann, wenn die Familie beim Senator zu Tische gebeten war und Tante Antonie oder Onkel Christian nach alter Gewohnheit sich über die arme Tante Klothilde lustig zu machen und in der ihr eigenen langgedehnten und demütig-freundlichen Sprache mit ihr zu reden begannen, so konnte es geschehen, daß Hanno, unter der Einwirkung des unalltäglich schweren Rotweines, einen Augenblick auch seinerseits in diesen Ton geriet und sich mit irgendeiner Mokerie an Tante Klothilde wandte. Dann lachte Thomas Buddenbrook – ein lautes, herzliches, ermunterndes, fast dankbares Lachen, wie ein Mensch, dem eine hocherfreuliche, heitere Genugtuung zuteil geworden ist, ja, er fing an, seinen Sohn zu unterstützen und selbst in die Neckerei einzustimmen: und doch hatte er sich eigentlich seit Jahr und Tag dieses Tones gegen die arme Verwandte begeben. Es war so billig, so gänzlich gefahrlos, seine Überlegenheit über die beschränkte, demütige, magere und immer hungrige Klothilde geltend zu machen, daß er es trotz aller Harmlosigkeit, die dabei herrschte, als gemein empfand. Mit Widerstreben empfand er es so, mit jenem verzweifelten Widerstreben, das er alltäglich im praktischen Leben seiner skrupulösen Natur entgegensetzen mußte, wenn er es wieder einmal nicht fassen, nicht darüber hinwegkommen konnte, wie es möglich sei, eine Situation zu erkennen, zu durchschauen und sie dennoch ohne Schamempfindung auszunutzen … Aber die Situation ohne Schamgefühl auszunutzen, sagte er sich, das ist Lebenstüchtigkeit!","Now and then, when the family was asked to sit down with the senator and Aunt Antonie or Uncle Christian, as was their old habit, began to make fun of poor Aunt Klothilde and to talk to her in her own long-drawn-out, humbly friendly language, she could it happened that Hanno, under the influence of the uncommonly heavy red wine, got into the same tone for a moment and turned to Aunt Klothilde with some mockery. Then Thomas Buddenbrook laughed - a loud, hearty, encouraging, almost grateful laugh, like a man who has been bestowed a most gratifying, cheerful satisfaction, yes, he began to support his son and join in the banter himself: and yet he had he actually used this tone against the poor relatives for years and days. It was so cheap, so completely safe, to claim his superiority over the limited, humble, skinny and always hungry Klothilde that, despite all the harmlessness that prevailed, he found it mean. He felt it that way with reluctance, with that desperate reluctance that he had to counteract his scrupulous nature in practical life every day, when once again he couldn't grasp it, couldn't get over how it was possible to recognize a situation, see through it and nevertheless, to take advantage of it without shame... But to take advantage of the situation without shame, he said to himself, that's the ability to live!","Now and then, when the family was gathered around the table and Aunt Antonie or Uncle Christian would fall back into their old habit of making fun of poor Aunt Klothilde and begin speaking with her in her own drawling, meek, amiable fashion, it sometimes happened that Hanno, feeling the effects of the heavy red wine reserved for special occasions, would adopt that tone of voice himself for a moment and make some teasing remark of his own to Aunt Klothilde. And then Thomas Buddenbrook would laugh—a loud, heartfelt, encouraging, almost grateful laugh, like a man surprised by some very amusing stroke of good luck; he would even egg Johann on and join in the teasing—when in fact, for years now, he had protested against taking that tone with their poor cousin. It was so cheap, so safe, to assert one’s superiority over humble, dull, skinny, and eternally hungry Klothilde, and despite the general harmlessness of it all, the whole idea seemed rather mean-spirited. But he fought against that feeling, too, just as he had to fight desperately against his own scruples in the practical affairs of everyday life—when a situation would arise and once again he could not comprehend, simply could not get over, the fact that, although he understood the ramifications, was able to see through to the heart of the matter, he still had to use the situation for his own purposes without any sense of shame. But to use a situation without any sense of shame, he told himself, that is what it means to be fit for real life.","Sometimes when the family were invited to dinner, Aunt Antonie or Uncle Christian would begin to tease Aunt Clothilde and imitate her meek, drawling accents. Then little Johann, stimulated by the heavy red wine which they gave him, would ape his elders and make some remarks to Aunt Clothilde in the same vein. And then how Thomas Buddenbrook would laugh! He would give a loud, hearty, jovial roar, like a man put in high spirits by some un-231 BUDDENBRO DKS expected piece of good luck, and join in on his son's side against poor Aunt Clothilde, though for his own part he had long since given up these witticisms at the expense of his poor relative. It was so easy, so safe, to tease poor, limited, modest, lean and hungry Clothilde, that, harmless though it was, he felt it rather beneath him. But he wished he did not, for it was the same story over again: too many considerations, too many scruples. Why must he be for ever opposing these scruples against the hard, practical affairs of life? Why could he never learn that it was possible to grasp a situation, to see around it, as it were, and still to turn it to one's own ad-vantage without any feeling of shame? For precisely this, he said to himself, is the essence of a capacity for practical life!"

"Nun! dachte Tony Grünlich. Welcher Satan möchte die wohl verschlingen! Aber sie sagte nichts, hielt sich ihrerseits an den Pudding und dachte darüber nach, ob sie wohl auch dermaleinst so häßlich sein werde wie die beiden Fräulein Gerhardt.","So! thought Tony Grünlich. What Satan would want to devour them! But she said nothing, held on to the pudding for her part and wondered whether one day she would be as ugly as the two Miss Gerhardts.","“Well, now,” Tony Grünlich thought, “what sort of Satan would want to devour you?” But she said nothing, just went on devouring her own pudding and wondering if there would ever come a day when she would be as ugly as the two Miss Gerhardts.","""Goodness!"" thought Tony Gr�nlich, ""how could Satan want to swallow her?"" But she said nothing and devoted herself to"" the pudding, wondering if she herself would ever become as ugly as the two Miss Grerhardts."
"Und da Frau Erika Weinschenk, geb. Grünlich, hierauf unter Tränen, die alles mögliche bedeuten konnten, genau so pflichtgemäß antwortete, wie Tony selbst einstmals unter ähnlichen Umständen in ihrer Villa bei Hamburg ihrem Vater geantwortet hatte, so fing man an, mit einer nahen Trennung zu rechnen …","And since Frau Erika Weinschenk, née Grünlich, answered this with tears that could mean anything, just as dutifully as Tony himself had once answered his father under similar circumstances in her villa near Hamburg, one began with a close one Anticipate separation...","And in response Frau Erika Weinschenk, née Grünlich, broke into tears that could have meant almost anything and provided a dutiful answer—just like the one Tony had provided her father under similar circumstances in her villa near Hamburg—giving rise to the assumption that a separation was imminent.","And Frau Erica Wrinschrnk, amid tears that might have mrant anything at all, replied just as dutifully as Tony her-self, in similar circumstances, had once replied to the same question, in the villa outside Hamburg. So it was necessary to cnntrniplale a parting in the near future."
"»Schön«, antwortete Christian. Und dann folgte wieder ein längeres Schweigen, während sie, links herum, auf dem äußeren Wege, an der Rokokofassade des »Portals« vorbei, den Garten umschritten, der die ersten Knospen trieb. Schließlich sagte der Konsul nach einem schnellen Aufatmen mit lauter Stimme: »Ich habe eben schweren Ärger gehabt, und zwar infolge deines Betragens.«","""Nice,"" answered Christian. And then there was another longer silence while they turned left, on the outer path, past the rococo facade of the ""portal,"" and walked around the garden, which was sprouting the first buds. Finally, after a quick sigh of relief, the Consul said in a loud voice, ""I have just been in serious trouble as a result of your conduct.""","“Fine,” Christian replied. And then came a long silence, during which they followed the outside path, passing the rococo façade of the “Portal” and skirting the garden, which was just coming into bloom. Finally the consul took a quick breath and said in a loud voice, “I am terribly angry—on your account.”","""Good,"" answered Christian. Then there was a long silence again, while they turned to the left and walked, by the out-side way, past the rococo ""portal"" right round the garden, where the buds were beginning to swell. Finally the Consul said in a loud voice, with a long breath, ""I have just been very angry, on account of your behaviour."""
"Klothilde war zum Sterben erstaunt. »Gott! Tom –?« machte sie, und es war unbegreiflich, wie lang sie diese kurzen Silben zu ziehen vermochte. Tony duldete schweigend, denn Tom war ihr überlegen, da half nichts; er würde wieder eine Antwort finden und die Lacher auf seiner Seite haben. Sie zog nur mit geöffneten Nasenflügeln heftig die Luft ein und hob die Schultern empor. Als aber die Konsulin von dem bevorstehenden Ball bei Konsul Huneus zu sprechen begann und etwas über neue Lackschuhe fallen ließ, nahm Tony auch den anderen Ellenbogen vom Tisch und zeigte sich lebhaft bei der Sache.","Klothilde was amazed to die. ""God! Tom -?' she said, and it was incomprehensible how long she could draw out those short syllables. Tony endured in silence, because Tom was superior to her, there was no help; he would find an answer again and have the laughs on his side. She just sucked in the air sharply, nostrils open, and shrugged her shoulders. But when the Consul began to talk about the forthcoming ball at Consul Huneus' and dropped something about new patent leather shoes, Tony took his other elbow off the table and showed himself animated.","Klothilde was embarrassed to death. “O Lord, Tom—?” she said, and it was unbelievable how she could draw out those three brief syllables. Tony endured the remark in silence—it was no use, Tom was quicker than she. He would be sure to have a comeback that would make them all laugh. She merely took a deep breath through her flared nostrils and shrugged. But when her mother began to talk about the ball coming up at Consul Huneus’s and mentioned something about new patent-leather shoes, Tony took her other elbow off the table and joined eagerly in the conversation.",""" Good gracious, Tom,"" she said. It was inconceivable how she could drawl out the syllables. Tony bore the jeer in silence. It was never any use, Tom was more than a match for her. He could al-ways get the last word and have the laugh on his side. Her nostrils dilated a little, and she shrugged her shoulders. But when the Consul's wife began to talk of the coming dance at the house of Consul Huneus, and let fall something- about new patent leather shoes, Tony took the other elbow off the table and displayed a lively interest."

"Als Doktor Langhals zurückkehrte, der ein wenig nach Hause gegangen war, fand er alles beim alten. Er nahm nur eine kurze Rücksprache mit der Pflegerin und empfahl sich wieder.

"»Du hast es nicht sehr gut gehabt, Onkel Gotthold«, dachte er. »Du hast es zu spät gelernt, Zugeständnisse zu machen, Rücksicht zu nehmen … Aber das ist nötig … Wenn ich wäre wie du, hätte ich vor Jahr und Tag bereits einen Laden geheiratet … Die dehors wahren!… Wolltest du es überhaupt anders, als du es gehabt hast? Obgleich du trotzig warst und wohl glaubtest, dieser Trotz sei etwas Idealistisches, besaß dein Geist wenig Schwungkraft, wenig Phantasie, wenig von dem Idealismus, der jemanden befähigt, mit einem stillen Enthusiasmus, süßer, beglückender, befriedigender als eine heimliche Liebe, irgendein abstraktes Gut, einen alten Namen, ein Firmenschild zu hegen, zu pflegen, zu verteidigen, zu Ehren und Macht und Glanz zu bringen. Der Sinn für Poesie ging dir ab, obgleich du so tapfer warst, trotz dem Befehl deines Vaters zu lieben und zu heiraten. Du besaßest auch keinen Ehrgeiz, Onkel Gotthold. Freilich, der alte Name ist bloß ein Bürgername, und man pflegt ihn, indem man einer Getreidehandlung zum Flor verhilft, indem man seine eigene Person in einem kleinen Stück Welt geehrt, beliebt und mächtig macht … Dachtest du: Ich heirate die Stüwing, die ich liebe, und schere mich um keine praktischen Rücksichten, denn sie sind Kleinkram und Pfahlbürgertum?… Oh, auch wir sind gerade gereist und gebildet genug, um recht gut zu erkennen, daß die Grenzen, die unserem Ehrgeize gesteckt sind, von außen und oben gesehen nur eng und kläglich sind. Aber alles ist bloß ein Gleichnis auf Erden, Onkel Gotthold! Wußtest du nicht, daß man auch in einer kleinen Stadt ein großer Mann sein kann? Daß man ein Cäsar sein kann an einem mäßigen Handelsplatz an der Ostsee? Freilich, dazu gehört ein wenig Phantasie, ein wenig Idealismus … und den besaßest du nicht, was du auch von dir selbst gedacht haben magst.«","""You haven't had it very well, Uncle Gotthold,"" he thought. »You learned too late to make concessions, to be considerate... But it is necessary... If I were like you, I would have married a shop years ago... Keeping the dehors!... Did you want it any other way than you had it Although you were defiant, and well believed that defiance was something idealistic, your mind had little dynamism, little imagination, little of the idealism that enables one to have a quiet enthusiasm sweeter, more exhilarating, more gratifying than a secret love, any abstract good , to cherish, to cherish, to defend, to honor and to bring power and splendor to an old name, a company sign. You lacked the sense of poetry, though you were brave enough to love and marry in defiance of your father's command. You didn't have any ambition either, Uncle Gotthold. Admittedly, the old name is just a bourgeois name, and one takes care of it by helping a grain business to prosper, by making one's own person honored, popular and powerful in a small piece of the world... Did you think: I'm going to marry the Stüwing, who I dear, and care not for practical considerations, for they are petty and philistinism?... Oh, we too are just traveled and educated enough to see quite well that the limits to our ambition are seen from without and from above are just narrow and pathetic. But everything is just a parable on earth, Uncle Gotthold! Didn't you know that you can be a great man even in a small town? That one can be a Caesar in a moderate trading post on the Baltic Sea? Of course, that takes a bit of imagination, a bit of idealism... and you didn't have that, whatever you may have thought of yourself.""","“You never had things very good, Uncle Gotthold,” he thought. “You learned too late to make concessions, to make allowances. But they are necessary. If I had been like you, I would have married my shop girl years ago. But one must keep up appearances. And did you ever really want things to be any other way? You were stubborn, though, and probably thought that there was something idealistic in being stubborn. You had too little momentum and imagination, too little of the idealism that enables a man to cherish, to nurture, to defend something as abstract as a business with an old family name—and to bring it honor and power and glory. That requires a quiet enthusiasm that is sweeter and more pleasant, more gratifying than any secret love. You lost your sense of poetry, although you were brave to love and marry against your father’s wishes. You had no ambition, Uncle Gotthold. Our family name is an ordinary name, I’ll grant you, and one nurtures it by helping a grain business flourish, and by making oneself powerful, respected, and loved in a little corner of the world. Did you think: ‘I’ll marry my Stüwing because I love her, and hang the practical considerations—those are nothing but petty, philistine details’? Oh, but we’ve all traveled about and learned enough to know only too well that the limits set to our ambitions are narrow and pathetic—when viewed from the outside or from on high. But everything in this world is comparative, Uncle Gotthold. Didn’t you know that one can be a great man in a small town? That a man can be a Caesar in an old commercial city on the Baltic? That takes a little imagination, I’ll grant, a little idealism—and that’s what you lacked, whatever you may have believed about yourself.”","""You haven't had a very good time, Uncle Gotthold,"" he thought. ""You learned too late to make concessions and shnw consideration. But that is what one has to do. If I had been like you, I should have married a shop girl years ago. But for the sake of appearances--! I wonder if you really wanted anything different? You were proud, and probably felt that your pride was something idealistic; but your spirit ^lad little power to rise. To cherish the vision of an abstract good; to carry in your heart, like a hidden love, only far sweeter, the dream of preserving an ancient name, an old family, an old business, of carrying it on, and adding to it more and more honour and lustre--ah, that takes imagi-nation, Uncle Gotthold, and imagination you didn't have. The sense of poetry escaped you, though you were brave tinuugh to love and marry against the will of your father. And you had no ambition, Uncle Cotthold. The old name is only a burgher name, it is true, and one cherishes it by making the grain business flourish, and oneself beloved and powerful in a little corner of the earth. Did you think: 'I will marry her whom I love, and pay no attention to prac-tical considerations, for they are petty and provincial?' Oh, we are travelled and educated enough to realize that the limits set to our ambition are small and petty enough, looked at from outside and above. But everything in this world is com-parative, Uncle Gotthuld. Did you know one can be a great man, even in a small place; a Caesar even in a little commercial town on the Baltic? But that takes imagination and idealism--and you didn't have it, whatever you may have thought yourself."""

"Dieser Klub, dem vorwiegend unverheiratete Kaufleute angehörten, besaß im ersten Stock eines Weinrestaurants ein paar komfortable Lokalitäten, woselbst man seine Mahlzeiten nahm und sich zu zwanglosen und oft nicht ganz harmlosen Unterhaltungen zusammenfand: denn es gab eine Roulette. Auch einige ein wenig flatterhafte Familienväter, wie Konsul Kröger und selbstverständlicherweise Peter Döhlmann, waren Mitglieder, und der Polizeisenator Cremer war hier »der erste Mann an der Spritze«. So drückte Doktor Gieseke, Andreas Gieseke, Sohn des Branddirektors, sich aus, Christians alter Schulkamerad, der in der Stadt sich als Rechtsanwalt niedergelassen hatte, und dem sich, trotzdem er für einen ziemlich wüsten Suitier galt, der junge Buddenbrook alsbald in erneuerter Freundschaft anschloß.","This club, to which mostly unmarried merchants belonged, had a few comfortable places on the first floor of a wine restaurant, where one took one's meals and met for informal and often not entirely harmless conversations: for there was a roulette. Some somewhat flighty fathers, such as Consul Kröger and, of course, Peter Döhlmann, were also members, and the police senator Cremer was ""the first man on the syringe"" here. This is how Doctor Gieseke, Andreas Gieseke, the fire director's son, put it, Christian's old school friend, who had established himself as a lawyer in the city and who, although he was considered a rather wild suiter, was soon joined by young Buddenbrook in renewed friendship .","The Club, whose members were primarily unmarried businessmen, occupied a few private rooms on the second floor of a wine restaurant—a place where one could take one’s meals and gather informally for harmless, and often not so harmless, amusements—including roulette.

"Ein kleines Kabinett mit einem buntfarbigen Fensterchen grenzte an das Rauchzimmer.

"Er hatte keine Zeit. Er war bei Gott überhäuft. Sie sollte sich gedulden und sich gefälligst noch fünfzigmal besinnen! Ihm stand jetzt zunächst, und zwar morgenden Tages, eine Fahrt nach Hamburg bevor: zu einer Konferenz, einer leidigen Unterredung mit Christian. Christian hatte geschrieben, um Unterstützung, um Aushilfe geschrieben, welche die Konsulin seinem dereinstigen Erbe entnehmen mußte. Um seine Geschäfte stand es jammervoll, und obgleich er beständig einer Reihe von Beschwerden unterlag, schien er sich im Restaurant, im Zirkus, im Theater doch königlich zu amüsieren, und, den Schulden nach zu urteilen, die jetzt zutage kamen und die er auf seinen gut klingenden Namen hin hatte machen können, weit über seine Verhältnisse zu leben. Man wußte in der Mengstraße, wußte es im »Klub« und in der ganzen Stadt, wer vor allem schuld daran war. Es war eine weibliche Person, eine alleinstehende Dame, die Aline Puvogel hieß und zwei hübsche Kinder besaß.

She should be patient and kindly think about it fifty times! The first thing he had to do now was a trip to Hamburg, tomorrow morning: to a conference, to a tiresome conversation with Christian. Christian had written for support, for temporary help, which the consul had to draw from his future inheritance. His business was in a miserable state, and although he was constantly subject to a series of grievances, he seemed to be enjoying himself like kings in the restaurant, in the circus, in the theater, and, judging by the debts that were now coming to light and that he owed his good-sounding name, to live far beyond his means.

His business was in dreadful shape, and although he was constantly complaining of his ailments, he was apparently amusing himself royally in restaurants, at the circus, and at the theater, and, to judge by debts that he had been able to pile up on the basis of his family’s good name and that were just now coming to light he was living far beyond his means. It was well known on Meng Strasse, in the Club, and all over town that the person responsible for all this was a woman by the name of Aline Puvogel, who lived alone with her two pretty children. Christian Buddenbrook was not the only merchant in Hamburg who maintained intimate and costly relations with this personage.","He had no time. Heaven knew he had no time.

"Kurze Zeit nach der Verlobung Hugo Weinschenks mit Erika Grünlich machte der Direktor seinem Schwager den Vorschlag, in das Versicherungsbüro einzutreten, und in der Tat arbeitete Christian vierzehn Tage lang im Dienste der Brandkasse. Leider jedoch zeigte sich dann, daß nicht allein die Qual in seiner linken Seite, sondern auch seine übrigen, schwer bestimmbaren Übel sich hierdurch verstärkten, daß übrigens der Direktor ein überaus heftiger Vorgesetzter war, der gelegentlich eines Mißgriffes keinen Anstand genommen hatte, seinen Schwager einen »Seehund« zu nennen … und Christian war genötigt, diesen Posten wieder zu verlassen.","A short time after Hugo Weinschenk became engaged to Erika Grünlich, the director suggested to his brother-in-law that he join the insurance office, and Christian did in fact work for a fortnight in the service of the fire insurance company. Unfortunately, however, it then turned out that not only the torment in his left side but also his other, hard-to-identify ailments were aggravated by this, that incidentally the director was an extremely violent superior who had occasionally made a mistake without objection, his brother-in-law one To call it a ""seal"" ... and Christian was forced to leave this post again.","Shortly after Hugo Weinschenk’s engagement to Erika Grünlich, he offered his future brother-in-law a position in his insurance office; and, indeed, Christian did spend two weeks in the service of the Municipal Fire Insurance Company. But then, unfortunately, the work caused a flair-up not only of the old ache in his left side, but also of several other of those ailments so difficult to diagnose. There was also the problem that the director was a very stern boss, and if Christian made a mistake he did not hesitate to tell his brother-in-law that he was as dense as a walrus—and Christian felt compelled to quit his job.","A short time after the betrothal of Hugo Weinschenk and Erica Gr�nlich, the Director proposed to his relative that he should enter the Insurance office; and Christian actually worked for two weeks in the service of the Company. But the misery in his side began to get worse, and his other, in- definable ills as well; and the Director proved to be a domineering superior, who did not hesitate, on the occasion of a little misunderstanding, to call his relative a booby. So Christian felt constrained to leave this post too."

Never...!"" exclaimed Frau Permaneder, raising her head with a jerk, looking wildly into her mother's face with tears in her eyes, and then just as suddenly hid her face in the folds of her clothes again.

"Der Regen ließ nicht nach. Er zerwühlte den Boden und tanzte in springenden Tropfen auf der See, die, vom Südwest überschauert, vom Strande zurückwich. Alles war in Grau gehüllt.

"Aber sie schritt zuvor noch am Kontoreingang vorbei, ein wenig nach rechts, dorthin, wo über ihr das kolossale Treppenhaus sich auftat, dieses Treppenhaus, das im ersten Stockwerk von der Fortsetzung des gußeisernen Treppengeländers gebildet ward, in der Höhe der zweiten Etage aber zu einer weiten Säulengalerie in Weiß und Gold wurde, während von der schwindelnden Höhe des »einfallenden Lichtes« ein mächtiger, goldblanker Lustre herniederschwebte … »Vornehm!« sagte Frau Permaneder leise und befriedigt, indem sie in diese offene und helle Pracht hineinblickte, die ihr ganz einfach die Macht, den Glanz und Triumph der Buddenbrooks bedeutete. Dann aber fiel ihr ein, daß sie in einer betrübenden Angelegenheit hierhergekommen sei, und sie wandte sich langsam dem Kontoreingang zu.","But first she walked past the office entrance, a little to the right, to where the colossal stairwell opened up above her, this stairwell that was formed on the first floor by the continuation of the cast-iron banister, but at the height of the second floor it became one wide gallery of columns in white and gold, while from the dizzying heights of the ""incoming light"" a mighty, golden luster floated down ... ""Noble!"" said Mrs. Permaneder quietly and contentedly, while she looked into this open and bright splendor, which she quite simply signified the power, splendor and triumph of the Buddenbrooks. But then she remembered that she had come here on a distressing matter, and slowly turned towards the entrance to the office.","But she first moved to her right, on past the office door, to stand in the vast open stairwell, which on the second floor was framed by a continuation of the wrought-iron railing and on the third by a gallery of white-and-gold columns; it ended in a massive burnished chandelier suspended from the dizzying heights of the “skylight.” “How elegant,” Frau Permaneder said in a low, satisfied voice as she gazed up into the bright, spacious splendor, which for her signified the prominence and triumph of the Buddenbrooks. But then it occurred to her that her mission was a sad one, and she slowly turned to the office door.","Yet she did not go at once into the office, but passed the door that led into it and stood at the bottom of the splendid staircase, which as far as the first storey had a cast-iron balustrade, but at the distance of the second storey became a wide pillared balcony in white and gold, with a great gilt chandelier hanging down from the skylight's dizzy height. ""Very elegant,"" said Frau Permaneder, softly, in a tone of great satisfaction, gazing up into this spacious magnificence. To her it meant, quite simply, the power, the brilliance, and the triumph of the Buddenbrook family. But now it occurred to her that she was not, in fact, come upon a very cheerful errand, and she slowly turned away and passed through the door into the office."

"»Wenn ich mir denken könnte, daß Tony irgendeinen delikaten Beweggrund hat, sich für diese Verbindung nicht entschließen zu können! Aber sie ist ein Kind, Bethsy, sie ist vergnügungslustig, tanzt auf Bällen, läßt sich von den jungen Leuten bekuren, und zwar mit Pläsier, denn sie weiß, daß sie hübsch und von Familie ist … sie ist vielleicht im geheimen und unbewußt auf der Suche, aber ich kenne sie, sie hat ihr Herz, wie man zu sagen pflegt, noch gar nicht entdeckt … Fragte man sie, so würde sie den Kopf hin und her drehen und nachdenken … aber sie würde niemanden finden … Sie ist ein Kind, ein Spatz, ein Springinsfeld … Sagt sie ja, so wird sie ihren Platz gefunden haben, sie wird sich nett installieren können, wonach ihr der Sinn steht, und ihren Mann schon nach ein paar Tagen lieben … Er ist kein Beau, nein, mein Gott, nein, er ist kein Beau … aber er ist immerhin im höchsten Grade präsentabel, und man kann am Ende nicht fünf Beine auf ein Schaf verlangen, wenn du mir die kaufmännische Phrase zugut halten willst!… Wenn sie warten will, bis jemand kommt, der eine Schönheit und außerdem eine gute Partie ist – nun, Gott befohlen! Tony Buddenbrook findet immer noch etwas. Indessen andererseits … es bleibt ein Risiko, und, um wieder kaufmännisch zu reden, Fischzug ist alle Tage, aber nicht alle Tage Fangetag!… Ich habe gestern vormittag in einer längeren Unterredung mit Grünlich, der sich ja mit dem andauerndsten Ernste bewirbt, seine Bücher gesehen … er hat sie mir vorgelegt … Bücher, Bethsy, zum Einrahmen! Ich habe ihm mein höchstes Vergnügen ausgesprochen! Seine Sachen stehen für ein so junges Geschäft recht gut, recht gut. Sein Vermögen beläuft sich auf etwa 120000 Taler, was ersichtlich nur die vorläufige Grundlage ist, denn er macht jährlich einen hübschen Schnitt … Was Duchamps sagen, die ich befragte, klingt auch nicht übel: Seine Verhältnisse seien ihnen zwar nicht bekannt, aber er lebe gentleman like, verkehre in der besten Gesellschaft, und sein Geschäft sei ein notorisch lebhaftes und weit verzweigtes … Was ich bei einigen anderen Hamburger Leuten, wie zum Beispiel bei einem Bankier Kesselmeyer, erfahren, hat mich gleichfalls vollauf befriedigt. Kurz, wie du weißt, Bethsy, ich kann nicht anders, als diese Heirat, die der Familie und der Firma nur zum Vorteil gereichen würde, dringend erwünschen! – Es tut mir ja leid, mein Gott, daß das Kind sich in einer bedrängten Lage befindet, daß sie von allen Seiten umlagert ist, bedrückt umhergeht und kaum noch spricht; aber ich kann mich schlechterdings nicht entschließen, Grünlich kurzerhand abzuweisen … denn noch eines, Bethsy, und das kann ich nicht oft genug wiederholen: Wir haben uns in den letzten Jahren bei Gott nicht in allzu hocherfreulicher Weise aufgenommen. Nicht als ob der Segen fehlte, behüte, nein, treue Arbeit wird redlich belohnt. Die Geschäfte gehen ruhig … ach, allzu ruhig, und auch das nur, weil ich mit äußerster Vorsicht zu Werke gehe. Wir sind nicht vorwärts gekommen, nicht wesentlich, seit Vater abgerufen wurde. Die Zeiten jetzt sind wahrhaftig nicht gut für den Kaufmann … Kurz, es ist nicht viele Freude dabei. Unsere Tochter ist heiratsfähig und in der Lage, eine Partie zu machen, die allen Leuten als vorteilhaft und rühmlich in die Augen springt – sie soll sie machen! Warten ist nicht ratsam, nicht ratsam, Bethsy! Sprich noch einmal mit ihr; ich habe ihr heute Nachmittag nach Kräften zugeredet …«","'If only I could think that Tony had some delicate reason for not being able to make this connection! But she's a kid, Bethsy, she's fun-loving, dances at balls, lets the young people treat her with pleasure, because she knows she's pretty and family Search, but I know her, she hasn't found her heart, as they say... If you asked her, she'd turn her head and think... but she wouldn't find anyone... She's a kid, a sparrow, a field of Springins... If she says yes, then she'll have found her place, she'll be able to set herself up however she likes, and after a few days she'll love her husband... He's not a beau, no, my God , no, he's no beau... but he's presentable in the highest degree, and you can't end up asking five legs on a sheep, if you'll credit me that mercantile phrase!... If she wants to wait for someone to come, who is a beauty and also a good match - well, God bless! Tony Buddenbrook always finds something. Meanwhile, on the other hand ... there remains a risk, and, to speak again in business terms, fishing is every day, but not every day catch day! ... Yesterday morning, in a lengthy conversation with Grünlich, who is applying with the most seriousness all the time, I got his books seen... he showed them to me... books, Bethsy, for framing! I expressed my greatest pleasure to him! His things are looking pretty good for such a young business, pretty good. His fortune amounts to around 120,000 thalers, which is obviously only the provisional basis, because he makes a nice cut every year ... What Duchamps say, whom I asked, doesn't sound bad either: they don't know his circumstances, but he lives a gentleman's life like, I am in the best of company, and his business is notoriously lively and widely ramified... What I learned from a few other people in Hamburg, such as a banker Kesselmeyer, also gave me complete satisfaction. In short, as you know, Bethsy, I cannot help but desire this marriage, which would only benefit the family and the company! - I'm sorry, my God, that the child is in a difficult situation, that she is surrounded on all sides, walks around depressed and hardly speaks; but I just can't bring myself to dismiss Grünlich out of hand...because one more thing, Bethsy, and I can't repeat it often enough: we haven't been very happily received by God in the last few years. Not that the blessing is lacking, beware, no, faithful work is fairly rewarded. Business is easy... oh, all too easy, and that's only because I work with extreme caution. We haven't progressed, not significantly, since father was called away. Times are really not good for the merchant now... In short, there is not much joy in it. Our daughter is nubile and capable of making a match that will catch everyone's eye as advantageous and laudable - let her make it! Waiting is not advisable, not advisable, Bethsy! Talk to her again; I did my best to persuade her this afternoon…”","CONSUL BUDDENBROOK said to his wife: “If only I could think of some reason, however delicate, Tony might have for deciding against this alliance. But she is a child, Bethsy; she enjoys her fun, dancing at balls, being courted by young men, relishes it all, because she knows she’s pretty and comes from a good family. Of course, it may be that secretly, unconsciously, she is looking on her own— but I know her , she hasn’t found her own heart yet, as the saying goes. And if you were to ask her, she would toss her head and think long and hard—and there wouldn’t be anyone. She is a child, a chickadee, a flighty young thing. If she would say yes, she could take her place in the world, set herself up quite nicely, which is what she really wants, and within a matter of days she would love her husband. He’s no Apollo, heaven knows, no Apollo. But he is certainly more than presentable, and there’s no use demanding a sheep with five legs, if you’ll permit me a businessman’s turn of phrase. And if she wants to wait until someone comes along who is both handsome and a good match —well, God help us all! Tony Buddenbrook can always find something. Of course, on the other hand … there is some risk, and, to use another business expression, just because you cast a net doesn’t mean you’ll catch any fish. I had a long talk with Herr Grünlich yesterday morning—he is indeed a most insistent suitor—and I saw his books, he spread them out for me himself. Books, my dear Bethsy, worthy of framing! I told him how delighted I was. Still a young enterprise—but he is doing quite well, quite well. His assets come to about 120,000 thalers, and that is obviously only the start, for he turns a tidy profit every year. And I asked the Duchamps, too, and what they said didn’t sound bad. Although they are not familiar with his circumstances, he lives like a gentleman, moves in the best society, and it is well known that his business is flourishing, branching out in all directions. And what I’ve learned from several other people in Hamburg—from Kesselmeyer the banker, for instance—was quite satisfactory as well. In brief, Bethsy, I can only sincerely wish that this marriage take place, to the benefit of both our family and the firm. Heaven knows, I am very sorry that the child finds herself in such a difficult position, besieged on all sides, walks around depressed and not talking to anyone. But I simply cannot bring myself to reject Grünlich out of hand. And one more thing, Bethsy, and I cannot say it too often: in the last few years we have, Lord knows, not been expanding to any appreciable extent. Not that things have been going badly, God forbid—no, hard work does have its honest reward. The business goes on quietly—all too quietly, and even that is only because I exercise great prudence. We have not moved ahead, not really, since Father passed on. These are definitely not good times for merchants. In brief, there is little cause for rejoicing. Our daughter is of a marriageable age and has the opportunity of making a match that anyone can see is both advantageous and honorable— and she should do it! It is not advisable to wait, not advisable, Bethsy! Do have a talk with her. I tried my best to persuade her this afternoon.”","CONSUL BUDDENBROOK said to his wife: ""If I thought Tony had a motive in refusing this match--But she is a child, Betsy. She enjoys going to balls and being courted by the young fellows; she is quite aware that she is pretty and from a good family. Of course, it is possible that she is consciously or unconsciously seeking a mate herself-- but I know the child, and I feel sure she has never yet found her heart, as the saying goes. If you asked her, she would turn this way and that way, and consider--but she would find nobody. She is a child, a little bird, a hoyden. Directly she once says yes, she will find her place. She will have carte blanche to set herself up, and she will love her husband, after a few days. He is no beau, God knows. But he is perfectly presentable. One mustn't ask for five legs on a sheep, as we say in business. If she waits for somebody to come along who is an Adonis and a good match to boot--well, God bless us, Tony Budden-brook could always find a husband, but it's a risk, after all. Every day is fishing-day, but not every day catching-day, to use another homely phrase--. Yesterday I had a long talk with Gr�nlich. He is a most constant wooer. He showed me all his books. They are good enough to frame. I told him I was completely satisfied. The business is young, but in fine condition--assets must be somewhere about a hundred and twenty thousand thaler, and that is obviously only the situation at the moment, for he makes a good slice every year. I asked the Duchamps. What they said doesn't sound at all bad. They don't know his connections, but he lives like a gentleman, mingles in society, and his business is known to be expanding. And some other people in Hamburg have told me 113 things--a banker named Kesselmeyer, for instance--that I feel pleased with. In short, as you know, Betsy, I can only wish for the consummation of this match, which would be highly advantageous for the family and the firm. I am heartily sorry the child feels so pressed. She hardly speaks at all, and acts as if she were in a slate of siege. But I can't bring myself to refuse him out and out. You know, Betsy, there is another thing I can't emphasize often enough: in these last years we haven't been doing any too brilliantly. Not that there's anything to complain of. Oh, no. Faithful work always finds its reward. Business goes quietly on--but a bit too quietly for me. And it only does that because I am eternally vigilant. We haven't perceptibly advanced since Father was taken away. The times aren't good for merchants. No, our prospects are not too bright. Our daughter is in a position to make a marriage that would undoubtedly be honourable and advantageous; she is of an age to marry, and she ought to do it. Delay isn't advisable--it isn't advisable, Betsy. Speak to her again. I said all I could, this after-noon."""

"Man hatte zum Teil auf den Stühlen und dem Sofa Platz genommen, man plauderte mit den Kindern, sprach über die frühe Kälte, das Haus … Herr Hoffstede bewunderte am Sekretär ein prachtvolles Tintenfaß aus Sevres-Porzellan in Gestalt eines schwarzgefleckten Jagdhundes. Doktor Grabow aber, ein Mann vom Alter des Konsuls, zwischen dessen spärlichem Backenbart ein langes, gutes und mildes Gesicht lächelte, betrachtete die Kuchen, Korinthenbrote und verschiedenartigen gefüllten Salzfäßchen, die auf dem Tische zur Schau gestellt waren. Es war das »Salz und Brot«, das der Familie von Verwandten und Freunden zum Wohnungswechsel übersandt worden war.

It was the ""salt and bread"" that relatives and friends had sent to the family when they moved house. But as it should be seen that the gift did not come from humble houses, the bread was sweet, spiced, and heavy pastry, and the salt was encased in solid gold.","Some adults seated themselves on the chairs, some on the sofa, and they chatted now with the children, commented on the unseasonable cold, on the house. Herr Hoffstede was admiring the splendid inkwell—a black-spotted hunting dog of Sèvres porcelain—that graced the secretary. Dr. Grabow, however, a man about the same age as the consul and with a long, kind, and gentle smiling face framed in whiskers, was inspecting the cakes, raisin bread, and various saltcellars set out for display on the table. This was the “salt and bread” sent by relatives and friends to mark the move to a new home. But as evidence that these were gifts from persons of some substance, the bread came in the form of sweet, spicy, heavy pastries and the salt in sturdy gold containers.","The company had for the most part seated themselves on the chairs and the sofa. They talked with the children or discussed the unseasonable cold and the new house. Herr Hoffstede admired a beautiful Sevres inkstand, in the shape of a black and white hunting dog, that stood on the secretary. Doctor Grabow, a man of about the Consul's age, with a long mild face between thin whiskers, was looking at the table, set out with cakes and currant bread and salt-cellars in different shapes. This was the ""bread and salt"" that had been sent by friends for the house warming; but the 11 ""bread"" consisted of rich, heavy pastries, and the salt came in dishes of massive gold, that the senders might not seem to be mean in their gifts."
"»Ich rechne«, sagte der Konsul trocken. Die Kerze flammte auf, und man sah, wie er gerade aufgerichtet und mit Augen, so kalt und aufmerksam, wie sie während des ganzen Nachmittags noch nicht darein geschaut hatten, fest in die tanzende Flamme blickte. – »Einerseits: Sie geben 33335 an Gotthold und 15000 an die in Frankfurt, und das macht 48335 in Summa. Andererseits: Sie geben nur 25000 an die in Frankfurt, und das bedeutet für die Firma einen Gewinn von 23335. Das ist aber nicht alles. Gesetzt, Sie leisten an Gotthold eine Entschädigungssumme für den Anteil am Hause, so ist das Prinzip durchbrochen, so ist er damals nicht endgültig abgefunden worden, so kann er nach Ihrem Tode ein gleich großes Erbe beanspruchen, wie meine Schwester und ich, und dann handelt es sich für die Firma um einen Verlust von Hunderttausenden, mit dem sie nicht rechnen kann, mit dem ich als künftiger alleiniger Inhaber nicht rechnen kann … Nein, Papa!« beschloß er mit einer energischen Handbewegung und richtete sich noch höher auf. »Ich muß Ihnen abraten, nachzugeben!« –","""I'm calculating,"" said the Consul dryly. The candle flared and he was seen straight up and staring fixedly at the dancing flame with eyes as cold and intent as they had not looked at all afternoon. – “On the one hand: you give 33,335 to Gotthold and 15,000 to the one in Frankfurt, and that makes 48,335 in total. On the other hand, you only give 25,000 to the ones in Frankfurt, and that means a profit of 23,335 for the company. But that's not all. Assuming you pay Gotthold compensation for his share in the house, then the principle has been breached, if he was not finally settled at the time, after your death he can claim an inheritance of the same size as my sister and I, and then act it's a loss of hundreds of thousands for the company, which they can't count on, which I, as the future sole proprietor, can't count on... No, Papa!« he decided with an energetic hand movement and straightened up even higher. ""I must advise you not to give in!""","“I’m figuring,” the consul said dryly. The candle flared and revealed him standing up straight; he stared into the dancing flame, his eyes colder and more alert than they had been all afternoon. “On the one hand: you give Gotthold 33,335 and Frankfurt 15,000; that comes to a total of 48,335. On the other hand: you simply give Frankfurt 25,000, which means the firm comes out 23,335 to the good. But that is not all. Assuming that you compensate Gotthold for his share in the house, the dam will be broken, meaning that he will never be satisfied and that after your death he can claim a portion of the inheritance equal to what my sister and I receive, bringing with it the loss of hundreds of thousands for the firm—lost capital that will no longer be available to me as its sole owner. No, Papa,” he concluded with an energetic wave of a hand and stood up taller still, “I must advise against your giving in.”","The Consul said shortly, ""I'm calculating."" He was standing erect, and the expression in his eyes had changed. They had looked dreamy all the evening; but now they stared into the candle-flame with a cold sharp gaze. ""Either you give thirty-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-three marks to Gotthold, and fifteen thousand to the family in Frankfort--that makes forty-eight thousand, three hundred and thirty-five in all--or, you give nothing to Gotthold, and twenty-five thou-sand to the family in Frankfort. That means a gain of twenty- three thousand, three hundred and thirty-five for the firm, But there is more to it than that. If you give Gotthold a compensation for the house, you've started the hall rolling. He is likely to demand equal shares with my sister and me after your death, which would mean a loss of hundreds of thousands to the firm. The firm could not face it, and I, as sole head, could not face it either."" He made a vigorous ges-ture and drew himself more erect than before. "" No, Papa,"" he said, and his tone bespoke finality, ""I must advise you not to give in."""

"Aber der kleine Johann sah mehr, als er sehen sollte, und seine Augen, diese schüchternen, goldbraunen, bläulich umschatteten Augen beobachteten zu gut. Er sah nicht nur die sichere Liebenswürdigkeit, die sein Vater auf alle wirken ließ, er sah auch – sah es mit einem seltsamen, quälenden Scharfblick –, wie furchtbar schwer sie zu machen war, wie sein Vater nach jeder Visite wortkarger und bleicher, mit geschlossenen Augen, deren Lider sich gerötet hatten, in der Wagenecke lehnte, und mit Entsetzen im Herzen erlebte er es, daß auf der Schwelle des nächsten Hauses eine Maske über ebendieses Gesicht glitt, immer aufs neue eine plötzliche Elastizität in die Bewegungen ebendieses ermüdeten Körpers kam … Das Auftreten, Reden, Sichbenehmen, Wirken und Handeln unter Menschen stellte sich dem kleinen Johann nicht als ein naives, natürliches und halb unbewußtes Vertreten praktischer Interessen dar, die man mit anderen gemein hat und gegen andere durchsetzen will, sondern als eine Art von Selbstzweck, eine bewußte und künstliche Anstrengung, bei welcher, anstatt der aufrichtigen und einfachen inneren Beteiligung, eine furchtbar schwierige und aufreibende Virtuosität für Haltung und Rückgrat aufkommen mußte. Und bei dem Gedanken, man erwarte, daß auch er dereinst in öffentlichen Versammlungen auftreten und unter dem Druck aller Blicke mit Wort und Gebärde tätig sein sollte, schloß Hanno mit einem Schauder angstvollen Widerstrebens seine Augen …","But little Johann saw more than he was supposed to, and his eyes, those shy, golden-brown eyes with a bluish shadow, observed too well. Not only did he see the sure kindness that his father worked on everyone, he also saw - saw it with a strange, tormenting perspicacity - how terribly difficult it was to make it, like his father more taciturn and pale after each visit, with closed Eyes whose lids had turned red, he leaned in the corner of the carriage, and with horror in his heart he saw that on the threshold of the next house a mask slid over this very face, and a sudden elasticity came again and again to the movements of this very tired body... Appearing, speaking, behaving, working and acting among people did not appear to little Johann as a naive, natural and half-unconscious representation of practical interests that one has in common with others and wants to assert against others, but as a kind of end in itself, a conscious and artificial effort in which, instead of the sincere and simple inner involvement, a terribly difficult and au freeing virtuosity had to come up for posture and backbone. And at the thought that one expected that he, too, would one day appear in public meetings and, under the pressure of all eyes, be active with words and gestures, Hanno closed his eyes with a shudder of anxious reluctance...","But little Johann saw more than he was meant to see, and his eyes, those shy, golden brown eyes ringed with bluish shadows, observed things only too well. Not only did he see his father’s poise and charm and their effect on everyone, but his strange, stinging, perceptive glance also saw how terribly difficult it was for his father to bring it off, how after each visit he grew more silent and pale, leaning back in one corner of the carriage, closing his eyes, now rimmed with red; as they crossed the threshold of the next house, Hanno watched in horror as a mask slipped down over that same face and a spring suddenly returned to the stride of that same weary body. First the entrance, then small-talk, fine manners, and persuasive charm—but what little Johann saw was not a naïve, natural, almost unconscious expression of shared practical concerns that could be used to one’s advantage; instead of being an honest and simple interest in the affairs of others, all this appeared to be an end in itself—a self-conscious, artificial effort that substituted a dreadfully difficult and grueling virtuosity for poise and character. Hanno knew that they all expected him to appear in public someday, too, and to perform, to prepare each word and gesture, with everyone staring at him—and at the thought, he closed his eyes with a shudder of fear and aversion.","But the little boy saw more than he should have seen; the shy, gold-brown, blue-shadowy eyes observed too well. He saw not only the unerring charm which his father exer-cised upon everybody: he saw as well, with strange and 23 D anguished penetration, how cruelly hard it was upon him. He saw how his father, paler and more silent after each visit, would lean back in his corner of the carriage with closed eyes and reddened eyelids; he realized with a sort of horror that on the threshold of the next house a mask would glide over his face, a galvanized activity take hold of the weary frame. Thus the visits, the social intercourse with one's kind, instead of giving little Johann, quite simply, the idea that one has prartiral interests in common with one's fellow men, which one looks after oneself, expecting others to do the same, appeared to him like an end in themselves; instead of straightforward and single-minded participation in the common business, he saw his father perform an artificial and complicated part, by dint of a fearful effort and an exaggerated, consuming virtuosity. And when he thought that some day he should be expected to perform the same part, under the gaze of the whole community, Hanno shut his eyes and shivered with rebellion and disgust."

"Christian kam von Hamburg, sehr elegant gekleidet und ein wenig angegriffen, aber lustig aussehend, erzählte, daß sein Geschäft mit Burmeester »tip-top« sei, erklärte, daß Klothilde und er sich wohl erst »da oben« verheiraten würden – »das heißt: Jeder für sich!…« und kam viel zu spät zur Kirche, weil er dem Klub einen Besuch abgestattet hatte. Onkel Justus war sehr gerührt und zeigte sich so kulant wie stets, indem er den Neuvermählten einen außerordentlich schönen, schwersilbernen Tafelaufsatz verehrte … Er und seine Frau hungerten zu Hause beinahe, denn die schwache Mutter bezahlte dem längst enterbten und verstoßenen Jakob, der sich, wie verlautete, augenblicklich in Paris aufhielt, nach wie vor von ihrem Wirtschaftsgelde die Schulden. – Die Damen Buddenbrook aus der Breitenstraße bemerkten: »Nun, hoffentlich hält es diesmal.« Wobei das Unangenehme der allgemeine Zweifel war, ob sie dies wirklich hofften … Sesemi Weichbrodt jedoch erhob sich auf die Zehenspitzen, küßte ihren Zögling, die nunmehrige Frau Permaneder, mit leicht knallendem Geräusch auf die Stirn und sagte mit ihren herzlichsten Vokalen: »Sei glöcklich, du gutes Kend!«","Christian came from Hamburg, very elegantly dressed and a little shaky but funny-looking, said that his deal with Burmeester was ""tip-top"", explained that Klothilde and he would probably only marry ""up there"" - ""that is : Everyone for themselves!...« and came to church much too late because he had paid a visit to the club. Uncle Justus was very touched and showed himself to be as accommodating as ever by presenting the newlyweds with an extraordinarily beautiful, heavy silver table centerpiece... He and his wife almost went hungry at home, because the weak mother paid Jakob, who had long been disinherited and rejected, who, like reported, who was currently staying in Paris, still owed her household money. – The Buddenbrook ladies from Breitenstrasse remarked: “Well, hopefully it will hold up this time.” The unpleasant thing was the general doubt as to whether they really hoped so … Sesemi Weichbrodt, however, got up on tiptoe, kissed her pupil, who was now Frau Permaneder, with a slight popping noise on the forehead, and said in her heartiest vowels, ""Be happy, you good Kend!""","Christian arrived from Hamburg, dressed very elegantly; he looked a little peaked, but he was in high spirits and declared that business and Burmeester were both “tip-top” and that he and Klothilde would probably have to wait to get married “in heaven—separately, I mean.” And he arrived at the church much too late for the ceremony, because he had paid a visit to the Club. Uncle Justus was very touched and proved as generous as always, giving the newlyweds an extraordinarily beautiful sterling-silver epergne—despite the fact that he and his weak-willed wife almost went hungry at home, because she continued to use her household money to pay the debts of the disowned and outcast Jakob, who was living in Paris at present, so people said. The Ladies Buddenbrook from Breite Strasse commented, “Well, let’s hope it lasts this time.” What made this even more unpleasant was a general doubt that they hoped anything of the sort. Sesame Weichbrodt, however, stood on her tiptoes, kissed her former ward—now Frau Permaneder—on the brow with a soft popping sound, and said with her most warmly exaggerated vowels, “Be heppy, you good chawld.”","Christian came from Hamburg, very elegantly dressed, looking a little ailing but very lively. He said his business with Burmeister was ""top-top""; thought that he and Tilda would probably get married ""up there""--that is to say, ""each one for himself, of course""; and came very late to the wedding from the visit he paid at the club. Uncle Justus was much moved by the occasion, and with his usual lavishness pre-sented the newly wedded pair with a beautiful heavy silver epergne. He and his wife practically starved themselves at home, for the weak woman was still paying the disinherited and outcast Jacob's debts with the house-keeping money. Jacob was rumoured to be in Paris at present. The Bud den-brook ladies from Broad Street made the remark: "" Well, let's hope it will last, this time.

"Sie las die altvertrauten Worte langsam und mit einfacher, zu Herzen gehender Betonung, mit einer Stimme, die sich klar, bewegt und heiter von der andächtigen Stille abhob. »Und den Menschen ein Wohlgefallen!« sagte sie. Kaum aber schwieg sie, so erklang in der Säulenhalle dreistimmig das »Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht«, in das die Familie im Landschaftszimmer einstimmte. Man ging ein wenig vorsichtig zu Werke dabei, denn die meisten der Anwesenden waren unmusikalisch, und hie und da vernahm man in dem Ensemble einen tiefen und ganz ungehörigen Ton … Aber das beeinträchtigte nicht die Wirkung dieses Liedes … Frau Permaneder sang es mit bebenden Lippen, denn am süßesten und schmerzlichsten rührt es an dessen Herz, der ein bewegtes Leben hinter sich hat und im kurzen Frieden der Feierstunde Rückblick hält … Madame Kethelsen weinte still und bitterlich, obgleich sie von allem fast nichts vernahm.","She read the familiar words slowly, with a simple, heartfelt intonation, in a voice that was clear, moving, and serene against the reverent silence. ""And goodwill to the people!"" she said. But she had scarcely been silent when the three voices in the columned hall rang out ""Silent Night, Holy Night,"" which the family joined in in the landscape room. One went to work a little cautiously, because most of those present were unmusical, and here and there one heard a deep and quite inappropriate tone in the ensemble ... But that did not affect the effect of this song ... Frau Permaneder sang it with trembling lips, for it touches most sweetly and painfully the heart of a man who has had an eventful life behind him and looks back in the brief peace of the ceremony... Madame Kethelsen wept quietly and bitterly, although she heard almost nothing of anything.","She read the familiar old words slowly, stressing each in a clear, stirring voice, her joy rising above the pious hush—and all hearts were touched. “And on earth peace, good will toward men,” she said. And no sooner did she fall silent than the columned hall was filled with harmonious voices singing “Silent night, holy night,” and the family in the landscape room joined in. They went about it rather cautiously, because most of them were not musical, and now and then a deep voice would sound a note quite inappropriate to the ensemble. But that did not detract from the effect. Frau Permaneder’s lips quivered as she sang, for the carol sounded sweetest and saddest to a woman whose heart had known a troubled life and who could cast an eye back over it now in this brief, peaceful, solemn hour. Madame Kethelsen wept silent, bitter tears, although she could hear almost nothing.","She read the old familiar words with a simple, heart-felt accent that sounded clear and moving in the pious hush. "" 'And to men good-will,' "" she finished, and from the pillared hall came a trio of voices: ""Holy night, peaceful nipht!"" The family in the landscape-room joined in. They did so cautiously, for most of them were unmusical, as a tone now and then betrayed. But that in no wise impaired the effect of the old hymn. Frau Permaneder sang with trembling lips; it sounded sweetest and most touching to the heart of her who had a troubled life behind her, and looked back upon it in the brief peace of this holy hour. Madame Kethelsen wept softly, but comprehended nothing."
"Wohl zu Unrecht verhoffe ich, daß Ihr Rechtssinn groß genug sein wird, um die Entrüstung zu ästimieren, welche ich empfand, als mein zweiter, so dringlicher Brief in betreff der wohl bewußten Angelegenheit ohne Antwort verblieb, nachdem nur auf den ersten eine Entgegnung (ich geschweige welcher Art!) zur Hand gekommen war. Ich muß Ihnen aussprechen, daß die Art, in welcher Sie die Kluft, welche, dem Herrn sei's geklagt, zwischen uns besteht, durch Ihre Hartnäckigkeit vertiefen, eine Sünde ist, welche Sie einstmals vor Gottes Richterstuhl aufs schwerste werden verantworten müssen. Es ist traurig genug, daß Sie vor Jahr und Tag, als ich, auch gegen Ihren Willen, dem Zuge meines Herzens folgend, meine nunmehrige Gattin ehelichte und durch Übernahme eines Laden-Geschäftes Ihren maßlosen Stolz beleidigte, sich so überaus grausam und völlig von mir wandten; allein die Weise, in welcher Sie mich jetzt traktieren, schreit zum Himmel, und sollten Sie vermeinen, daß ich mich angesichts Ihres Schweigens kontentiert und still verhalten werde, so irren Sie gröblichst. – Der Kaufpreis Ihres neu erworbenen Hauses in der Mengstraße hat 100000 Kurantmark betragen und ist mir ferner bekannt, daß Ihr Sohn aus zweiter Ehe und Associé, Johann, bei Ihnen mietweise wohnhaft ist und nach Ihrem Tode mit dem Geschäfte auch das Haus als alleiniger Besitzer übernehmen wird. Mit meiner Stiefschwester in Frankfurt und ihrem Gatten haben Sie Vereinbarungen getroffen, in die ich mich nicht zu mischen habe. Was aber mich, Ihren ältesten Sohn, angeht, so treiben Sie Ihren unchristlichen Zorn so weit, es schlanker Hand zu refüsieren, mir irgendeine Entschädigungssumme für den Anteil am Hause zukommen zu lassen! Ich habe es mit Stillschweigen übergangen, als Sie mir bei meiner Verheiratung und Etablierung 100000 Kurantmark auszahlten und mir testamentarisch ein für allemal nur ein Erbteil von 100000 zusprachen. Ich war damals nicht einmal hinlänglich orientiert über Ihre Vermögensverhältnisse. Jetzt jedoch sehe ich klarer, und da ich mich nicht als prinzipiell enterbt zu betrachten brauche, so beanspruche ich in diesem besonderen Falle eine Entschädigungssumme von 33335 Kurantmark, will sagen ein Drittel der Kaufsumme. Ich will keine Vermutungen darüber anstellen, welchen verdammungswürdigen Einflüssen ich die Behandlung verdanke, welche ich bislang zu dulden genötigt war; aber ich protestiere gegen dieselbe mit dem ganzen Rechtssinn des Christen und des Geschäftsmannes und versichere Sie zum letzten Male, daß, sollten Sie sich nicht entschließen können, meine gerechten Ansprüche zu respektieren, ich Sie weder als Christ noch als Vater noch als Geschäftsmann länger werde achten können.","I hope, unjustly, that your legal sense will be great enough to assimilate the indignation I felt when my second, so urgent letter concerning the well-known matter received no answer, after only a reply to the first (I let alone what kind!) had come to hand. I must tell you that the way in which you persist in widening the chasm between us, be it to the Lord, is a sin for which you will one day have to answer most severely before God's judgment seat. It is sad enough that year and day ago, when I, even against your will, following the impulse of my heart, married my future wife and offended your boundless pride by taking over a shop, you broke away so extremely cruelly and completely from me turned but the way in which you are treating me now is a cry to heaven, and if you think that I will behave in a contented and silent manner in the face of your silence, you are grossly mistaken. – The purchase price of your newly acquired house in Mengstraße was 100,000 Kurantmarks and I also know that your son from your second marriage and associate, Johann, rents from you and after your death will take over the business as the sole owner will. You have made agreements with my stepsister in Frankfurt and her husband, in which I am not to interfere. But as for me, your eldest son, carry your unchristian anger so far as to refrain from giving me any compensation for my share of the house! I passed over it in silence when you paid me 100,000 Kurantmarks upon my marriage and establishment and only promised me an inheritance of 100,000 once and for all in your will. At the time, I wasn't even sufficiently informed about your financial situation. Now, however, I see it more clearly, and since I do not need to consider myself disinherited in principle, I am claiming compensation of 33,335 Kurantmarks in this particular case, that is to say a third of the purchase price. I will not conjecture to what damnable influences I owe the treatment I have hitherto had to endure; but I protest against it with all the righteousness of the Christian and the businessman, and assure you for the last time that, should you not make up your mind to respect my just claims, I will no longer respect you either as a Christian, or as a father, or as a businessman be able.","I am most likely mistaken to hope that your sense of justice is sufficient for you to gauge my indignation upon receiving no answer to my second urgent letter, written upon receipt of your reply (which I shall not presume to characterize!) to my initial inquiry regarding the matter at issue. I must, however, assert that I consider the manner in which you have chosen to widen the lamentable rift separating us to be a sin for which one day you shall indeed be called to answer before the judgment seat of God. It is sad enough that upon a day long past you chose to turn against me so cruelly and completely, merely because in following the inclinations of my heart I wed my present spouse and in so doing took charge of a certain retail establishment, thereby offending your inordinate pride. Yet the manner in which you are treating me at present cries out to Heaven, and, should you entertain the idea that in light of your silence I shall be content to remain silent myself, you are sadly mistaken. The purchase price of the house you recently acquired on Meng Strasse was some 100,000 marks courant, and I am also aware that Johann, your joint partner and the son of your second marriage, currently leases lodgings with you and that upon your death will become the sole owner of both your business and your house. You have come to an agreement with my stepsister and her husband in Frankfurt, and I have no intention of interfering in the matter. But as regards me, your eldest son, you have gone so far in your un-Christian anger as to refuse me outright any compensation for my share in the house! I kept my peace when you chose to make a payment of 100,000 marks courant so that I might set up my own business at the time of my marriage and also promised a single payment of another 100,000 as my share of the inheritance. At the time I was not sufficiently cognizant of the extent of your wealth. Now, however, I see things more clearly, and since I need not regard myself as disinherited on principle, I therefore lay claim in this particular instance to a compensation of 33,335 marks courant, that is to say, one-third of the purchase price. I do not choose to speculate to what damnable influences I owe the treatment I have thus far received and borne so patiently; but I do protest said treatment with all the sense of justice I can muster as a Christian and a man of business, and I assure you for the last time that, should you not choose to respect my just claims, I will no longer be able to respect you either as a Christian or as my father or as a man of business.","I am probably mistaken in entertaining any further hope of your sense of justice or any appreciation of my feelings at receiving no reply from my second pressing letter con-cerning the matter in question. I do not comment again on the character of the reply I received to my first one. I feel compelled to say, however, that the way in which you, by your lamentable obstinacy, are widening the rift between us, is a sin for which you will one day have ID answer grievously before the judgment seat of God. It is sad enough that when I followed the dictates of my heart and married against your wishes, and further wounded your insensate pride by taking over a shop, you should have repulsed me so cruelly and remorselessly; but the way in which you now treat me cries out to Heaven, and you are utterly mistaken if you imagine that I intend to accept your silence without a struggle. The purchase price of your newly acquired house in the Mengstrasse was a hundred thousand marks; and I am aware that Johann, your business partner and your son by your second marriage, is living with you as your tenant, and after your death will become the sole proprietor of both house and business. With my step-sister in Frankfort, you have entered into agreements which are no concern of mine. But what does concern me, your eldest son, is that you carry your un-Christian spirit so far as to refuse me a penny of compensation for my share in the house. When you gave me a hundred thousand marks on my marriage and to set me up in business, and told me that a similar sum and no more should be bequeathed me by will, I said nothing, for T was not at the time sufficiently informed as to the amount of your fortune. Now I know more: and not regarding my-self as disinherited in principle , I claim as my right the sum of thirty-three thousand and three hundred and thirty-three marks current, or a third of the purchase price. I make no comment on the damnable influences which are responsible for the treatment I have received. But I protest against them with my whole sense of justice as a Christian and a business man. Let me tell you for the last time that, if you cannot bring yourself to recognize the justice of my claims, I shall no longer be able to respect you as a Christian, a parent, or a man of business."

"Johann Buddenbrook, der sich allgemach der Mitte der Vierziger näherte, hatte in den letzten Jahren ersichtlich gealtert. Seine kleinen, runden Augen schienen noch tiefer zu liegen, die große, gebogene Nase sprang, wie die Wangenknochen, noch schärfer hervor, und ein Puderquast schien an den Schläfen ein paarmal ganz leicht sein aschblondes, sorgfältig gescheiteltes Haar berührt zu haben. Die Konsulin ihrerseits stand am Ende der Dreißiger, aber sie konservierte ihre nicht schöne und dennoch glänzende Erscheinung aufs beste, und ihr mattweißer Teint mit den vereinzelten Sommersprossen hatte an Zartheit nichts eingebüßt. Ihr rötliches, kunstvoll frisiertes Haar war vom Schein der Kerzen durchleuchtet. Während sie die ganz hellblauen Augen ein wenig beiseite gleiten ließ, sagte sie:","Johann Buddenbrook, approaching his mid-forties, had aged visibly in recent years. His small, round eyes seemed to be set even deeper, the large, curved nose, like his cheekbones, stood out even more sharply, and a powder puff seemed to have lightly touched his ash-blonde, carefully parted hair a couple of times on the temples. The Consul, for her part, was in her late thirties, but she preserved her unattractive, yet lustrous appearance very well, and her matt white complexion with a few freckles had lost none of its delicacy. Her reddish, elaborately styled hair was illuminated by the candlelight. As she let her very light blue eyes slide a little aside, she said:","Johann Buddenbrook, now fast approaching his mid-forties, had visibly aged in the last few years. His little, round eyes seemed to lie deeper than ever; his large, aquiline nose stood out more sharply; and although the part in his hair was as precise as ever, it looked as if the ashy blond at his temples had been lightly dusted with a powder puff. His wife, however, was still in her late thirties, and, though never beautiful, she had preserved her radiant presence most admirably, and her soft white complexion with its scattered freckles had lost nothing of its delicacy. Her reddish, fashionably coiffed hair shone in the candlelight. With just a hint of a sidelong glance from her pale blue eyes, she said, “I wanted to suggest something for you to consider, my dear Jean.","Johann Buddenbrook was Hearing the middle forties, and had visibly altered in the last years. His little round eyes seemed to have sunk deeper in his head, his cheek-bones and his large aquiline nose stood out more prominently than ever, and the ash-blond hair seemed to have been just touched with a pDwder-puff where it parted on the temples. The Frau Consul was at the end of her thirties, but, while never beau-tiful, was as brilliant as ever; her dead-white skin, with a single freckle here and there, had lost none of its splendour, and the candle-light shone on the rich red-blond hair that was as wonderfully dressed as ever. Giving her husband a sidelong glance with her clear blue eyes, she said: ""Jean, I wanted to ask you to consider something: if it would not perhaps be advisable to engage a man-servant."

"Er lehnte am Flügel, in seinem Kopenhagener Matrosenanzug mit dem breiten Leinwandkragen, dem weißen Halseinsatz und dem dicken Schifferknoten, der unter dem Kragen hervorquoll, die zarten Beine gekreuzt, Kopf und Oberkörper ein wenig abgewandt, in einer Haltung voll scheuer und unbewußter Grazie. Vor zwei oder drei Wochen war sein langes Haar ihm abgeschnitten worden, weil in der Schule nicht nur seine Kameraden, sondern auch seine Lehrer sich darüber lustig gemacht hatten. Aber auf dem Kopfe war es noch stark und weich gelockt und wuchs tief in die Schläfen und in die zarte Stirn hinein. Er hielt seine Lider gesenkt, daß die langen, braunen Wimpern auf die bläuliche Umschattung seiner Augen fielen, und seine geschlossenen Lippen waren ein wenig verzerrt.","He was leaning against the wing, in his Copenhagen sailor suit with the wide canvas collar, the white neck yoke and the thick sailor's knot protruding from under the collar, his delicate legs crossed, his head and torso a little turned away, in an attitude of shy and unconscious grace.

His long hair had finally been cut two or three weeks before—not only his classmates had been making fun of him, but his teachers as well. But there was still a full, wavy growth on top, which fell down over his temples and delicate brow. He kept his eyelids lowered, so that his long, brown lashes fell across the bluish shadows around his eyes, and he held his tight-closed lips a little askew.","He leaned against the piano, in his blue sailor suit with the white V front and the wide linen collar with a big sailor's knot coming out beneath.

"Als der Senator in das halbdunkle Schlafzimmer trat, war seine Miene munter und seine Haltung energisch. Er war so gewöhnt daran, Sorge und Müdigkeit unter einem Ausdruck von überlegener Sicherheit zu verbergen, daß beim Öffnen der Tür diese Maske beinahe von selbst infolge eines ganz kurzen Willensaktes über sein Gesicht geglitten war.","When the senator entered the dim bedroom, his expression was bright and his demeanor energetic. He was so accustomed to concealing worry and weariness under an expression of superior assurance that when he opened the door that mask slipped over his face almost of its own accord by a very brief act of will.","The senator entered the half-darkened bedroom with energy in his step and a cheerful expression on his face. He was so used to hiding his cares and fatigue behind a look of lofty self-assurance that, as he opened the door, the mask slipped over his face almost by itself, with only the least act of will on his part.","When the Senator entered the darkened room, his mien appeared alert and his bearing energetic. He was used to hiding his cares and weariness under an air of calm-ness and poise; and the mask glided over his features as he opened the door, almost as though by a single act of will."
"Die gehässige Verachtung, die Thomas auf seinem Bruder ruhen ließ und die dieser mit einer nachdenklichen Indifferenz ertrug, äußerte sich in all den feinen Kleinlichkeiten, wie sie nur zwischen Familiengliedern, die aufeinander angewiesen sind, zutage treten. Kam zum Beispiel das Gespräch auf die Geschichte der Buddenbrooks, so konnte Christian in die Stimmung geraten, die ihm allerdings nicht sehr gut zu Gesichte stand, mit Ernst, Liebe und Bewunderung von seiner Vaterstadt und seinen Vorfahren zu reden. Alsbald beendete der Konsul mit einer kalten Bemerkung das Gespräch. Er ertrug das nicht. Er verachtete seinen Bruder so sehr, daß er ihm nicht gestattete, dort zu lieben, wo er selbst liebte. Er hätte es viel lieber gehört, wenn Christian im Dialekte Marcellus Stengels davon gesprochen hätte. Er hatte ein Buch gelesen, irgendein historisches Werk, das starken Eindruck auf ihn gemacht und das er mit bewegten Worten rühmte. Christian, ein unselbständiger Kopf, der das Buch allein gar nicht ausfindig gemacht haben würde, aber eindrucksfähig und jeder Beeinflussung zugänglich, las es, in dieser Weise vorbereitet und empfänglich gemacht, nun gleichfalls, fand es ganz herrlich, gab seinen Empfindungen möglichst genauen Ausdruck … und fortan war das Buch für Thomas erledigt. Er sprach mit Gleichgültigkeit und Kälte davon. Er tat, als habe er es kaum gelesen. Er überließ seinem Bruder, es allein zu bewundern …","The hateful contempt that Thomas bestowed on his brother, and which he endured with a thoughtful indifference, expressed itself in all the subtle pettiness that only comes to light between dependent family members. If, for example, the conversation turned to the history of the Buddenbrooks, Christian could get into the mood, although it did not suit him very well, to talk about his native town and his ancestors with seriousness, love and admiration. The consul soon ended the conversation with a cold remark. He couldn't take it. He despised his brother so much that he would not allow him to love where he loved himself. He would have much preferred hearing Christian speak of it in Marcellus Stengel's dialect. He had read a book, some historical work, which made a strong impression on him and which he praised in moving words. Christian, a dependent person, who would not have found the book on his own, but capable of making impressions and open to any influence, read it, prepared in this way and made receptive, also, found it wonderful, expressed his feelings as precisely as possible ... and henceforth the book was finished for Thomas. He spoke of it with indifference and coldness. He pretended he had barely read it. He left his brother to admire it alone...","The fierce contempt in which Thomas held his brother—and the wistful indifference with which Christian bore it—found expression in all those trivial moments of life that can only manifest themselves among people thrown together in families. If, for example, conversation turned to the history of the Buddenbrooks, Christian could become wrapped up in a mood of high seriousness—which ill became him—and speak with love and admiration of his hometown and his forebears. The consul would immediately cut him off with an icy remark. He could not stand it. He despised his brother so much that he would not allow him to love the things he loved. He would have much preferred to hear Christian speak of them in his Marcellus Stengel voice. Thomas had read a book, some historical work, that had made a strong impression on him, and he praised it in stirring words. Christian was impressionable and easily influenced, always depending on others for his views; he would never have found such a book on his own. But he read it now, and, having been primed and made receptive by Tom’s praise of it, he found it quite splendid himself, describing his reactions as precisely as possible. And from that moment the book was spoiled for Tom. He spoke of it with cold disregard. He pretended he had barely looked at it. He left it to his brother to admire it all by himself.","Thomas's contemp-tuous ill will, which Christian bore with quiet indifference, expressed itself in all the trifling situations that Dome up be-tween members of a family. If the conversation turned upon the Buddenbrook family history, Christian might be in the mood to speak with serious love and admiration of his native town and of his ancestors. It sat rather oddly on him, to be sure, and the Consul could not stand it: he would cut short the conversation with some cold remark. He despised his brother so much that he could not even permit him to love where he did. If Christian had uttered the same sentiments in the dialect of Marcellus Stengel, Tom could have borne it better. He had read a book, a historical work, which had made such a strong impression on him that he spoke about it and praised it in the family. Christian would by himself never have found out the book; but he was impressionable and accessible to every influence; so he also read it, found it wonderful, and described his reactions with all possible de-tail. That book was spoiled for Thomas for ever. He spoke of it with cold and critical detachment. He pretended hardly to have read it. He completely gave it over to his brother, to admire all by himself."

"Tiburtius ist also nach Riga abgereist und wird seine Braut im August noch einmal besuchen? Nun, es wird wahrhaftig munter zugehen alsdann bei uns in der Mengstraße – munterer noch, als Ihr alle vorausseht, denn Ihr wißt nicht, aus welchen absonderlichen Gründen ich so überaus froh erstaunt über Mademoiselle Klaras Verlobung bin und um welches allerliebste Zusammentreffen es sich dabei handelt. Ja, meine ausgezeichnete Frau Mama, wenn ich mich heute bequeme, meinen gravitätischen Konsens zu Klaras irdischem Glücke von der Amstel zur Ostsee zu senden, so geschieht es ganz einfach unter der Bedingung, daß ich mit wendender Post aus Deiner Feder einen ebensolchen Konsens in betreff einer ebensolchen Angelegenheit zurückempfange!

Yes, my excellent Mrs. Mama, if today I deign to send my solemn consensus on Klara's earthly happiness from the Amstel to the Baltic Sea, I do so quite simply on the condition that I send a letter from your pen regarding a similar consensus receive back a similar matter!

Yes, my dear good Mama, in submitting my solemn consent from here on the Amstel for Clara to enjoy future earthly happiness on the Baltic, I do so on one simple condition—that by return post I may receive from your pen just such a solemn consent to just such a happy enterprise.

"Der Konsul konnte ihr Gesicht nicht sehen; aber es trug den Ausdruck, der an manchem Sommerabend, wenn sie zu Travemünde an dem Fenster ihres kleinen Zimmers lehnte, darauf gelegen hatte … Ihr einer Arm ruhte auf den Knien ihres Vaters, während die Hand schlaff und ohne Stütze nach unten hing. Selbst diese Hand drückte eine unendlich wehmütige und zärtliche Hingebung aus, eine erinnerungsvolle und süße Sehnsucht, die in die Ferne schweifte.","The Consul could not see her face; but it bore the expression she had lain on it on many a summer evening when she was leaning against the window of her small room in Travemünde...

"Eine Anziehungskraft, einen seltsamen Reiz besaß dieses Wartezimmer, und das war ein stattlicher bunter Papagei mit giftigen kleinen Augen, der in einem Winkel inmitten eines Messingbauers saß und aus unbekannten Gründen Josephus hieß. Mit der Stimme eines wütenden alten Weibes pflegte er zu sagen: »Nehmen Sie Platz … Einen Momang …« und obgleich dies unter den obwaltenden Umständen wie ein abscheulicher Hohn klang, war Hanno Buddenbrook ihm mit einem Gemisch von Liebe und Grauen zugetan. Ein Papagei … ein großer, bunter Vogel, welcher Josephus hieß und reden konnte! War er nicht wie entwischt aus einem Zauberwalde, aus einem der Grimmschen Märchen, die Ida zu Hause vorlas?… Auch das »Bitte«, mit dem Herr Brecht die Tür öffnete, wiederholte Josephus aufs eindringlichste, und so geschah es, daß man seltsamerweise lachend das Operationszimmer betrat und sich auf den großen, unheimlich konstruierten Stuhl am Fenster setzte, neben dem die Tretmaschine stand.","This waiting room possessed an attraction, a strange allure, and that was a stately, colorful parrot with poisonous little eyes, who sat in a corner in the middle of a brass worker and, for unknown reasons, was called Josephus. In the voice of an angry old woman he used to say: 'Have a seat... A momang...' and though that sounded like a hideous mockery under the circumstances, Hanno Buddenbrook was fond of him with a mixture of love and dread. A parrot ... a big, colorful bird, which was called Josephus and could talk! Hadn't he escaped from an enchanted forest, from one of the Grimm fairy tales that Ida was reading at home?... Josephus also repeated the ""Please"" with which Herr Brecht opened the door most insistently, and so it happened that, oddly enough, one laughed entered the operating room and sat down in the large, eerily constructed chair by the window, next to which stood the pedal machine.","The waiting room had one strange, fascinating attraction: an imposing, brightly colored, evil-eyed parrot, which sat in the middle of a bronze cage placed in one corner of the room. For some inexplicable reason it was named Josephus. In the scolding voice of an old woman, it would say, “Take a seat. One moment, please.” Given the circumstances, it sounded like horrible mockery, and yet Hanno Buddenbrook felt a strange attraction for the bird, a mixture of affection and horror. A parrot, a big, brightly colored parrot named Josephus—and it could talk! Perhaps it had escaped from a magic forest or from one of the Grimm’s fairy tales that Ida read to him at home. And whenever Herr Brecht opened the door, Josephus would repeat his “Next, please!” so emphatically that, strangely enough, Hanno would find himself smiling as he entered the treatment room and then sat down in the large, eerie contraption of a chair near the window, and nearer the treadle.","This operating-room possessed one strange attraction, a gorgeous parrot with venomous little eyes, which sat in a brass cage in the corner and was called, for unknown reasons, Josephus. He used to say ""Sit down; one moment, please,"" in a voice like an old fish-wife's; and though the hideous cir-cumstances made this sound like mockery, yet Hanno felt for the bird a curious mixture of fear and affection. Imagine--a parrot, a big, bright-coloured bird, that could talk and was called Josephus! He was like something out of an en-chanted forest; like Grimm's fairy tales, which Ida read aloud to him. And when Herr Brecht opened the door, his invitation was repeated by Josephus in such a way that somehow Hanno was laughing when he went into the operating-room and sat down in the queer big chair by the window, next the treadle machine."

"Solchen Maßregeln entsprach das freudlose Tempo, das der Geschäftsgang angenommen hatte. Nichts war mehr zu verspüren von dem neuen und frischen Geiste, mit dem der junge Thomas Buddenbrook einst den Betrieb belebt hatte – und sein Sozius, Herr Friedrich Wilhelm Marcus, welcher, nur mit geringem Kapitale beteiligt, in keinem Falle bedeutenden Einfluß besessen hätte, war von Natur und Temperament jeder Initiative bar.","Such measures corresponded to the cheerless pace which business had assumed. There was nothing left of the new and fresh spirit with which the young Thomas Buddenbrook had once revived the business - and his associate, Mr. Friedrich Wilhelm Marcus, who, with only a small capital stake, would never have had any significant influence by nature and temperament devoid of any initiative.","These measures were consistent with the dismal tempo at which his business had been moving. There was no trace now of the new and fresh spirit that Thomas Buddenbrook had once brought to the firm; and his partner, Herr Friedrich Wilhelm Marcus, whose invested capital was small and who therefore could never have exerted any significant influence, was by nature and temperament a man lacking in initiative.","Such decrees as these were in harmony with the joyless state of affairs in the firm.

"Wenn solche Anschaffungen und Restaurierungen ihm vorübergehend eine gewisse Befriedigung und Beruhigung gewährten, so mochte er die Ausgaben dafür sich skrupellos gestatten, denn seine Geschäfte gingen in diesen Jahren so ausgezeichnet wie ehemals nur zur Zeit seines Großvaters. Der Name der Firma gewann nicht nur in der Stadt, sondern auch draußen an Klang, und innerhalb des Gemeinwesens wuchs noch immer sein Ansehen. Jedermann anerkannte mit Neid oder freudiger Teilnahme seine Tüchtigkeit und Geschicklichkeit, während er selbst vergeblich danach rang, mit Behagen in Reihe und Ordnung zu schaffen, weil er hinter seiner planenden Phantasie sich beständig zum Verzweifeln im Rückstande fühlte.","If such purchases and restorations afforded him a certain temporary satisfaction and reassurance, he could allow himself unscrupulous spending on them, for his business was doing better in those years than only in his grandfather's time. The company's name caught on not only in the city but abroad, and its reputation within the community was still growing. Everyone, with envy or joyful sympathy, acknowledged his skill and skill, while he himself struggled in vain to create order with contentment, because behind his planning imagination he felt constantly desperately behind.","And if such purchases and refurbishments gave him some temporary satisfaction and reassurance, he certainly could allow himself to spend the money in good conscience, because business was now flourishing as well as it had only in his grandfather’s day. The firm grew in stature not only in the town but also beyond it, and within the community his own reputation grew as well. Everyone acknowledged, whether out of envy or admiration, his cleverness and his hard work—and all the while he was wrestling in vain to find comfort in order and routine, because, to his despair, he found himself forever falling behind his own active imagination.","If such wholesale buying afforded him passing relief and satisfaction, he could indulge himself in it without scruple, for his business at this time was as brilliant as ever it had been in his grandfather's day. The repute of the firm grew, not only in the town but round about, and throughout the whole community he continued to be held in ever greater regard. His talents were admitted on all hands, with ad-miration or envy as the case might be; while he himself wrestled ceaselessly, at times despairingly, to evolve an order and method of work which should enable him to overtake the flights of his own restless imagination."
"»Du hast dich für … Aber das ist denn doch … Höre mal!« rief der Konsul, indem er beide Hände, die Innenflächen nach oben, vor sich ausstreckte und sie, mit seitwärts geneigtem Kopfe, erregt demonstrierend schüttelte. »Du sagst in einer Gesellschaft, die sowohl aus Kaufleuten als aus Gelehrten besteht, daß alle es hören können: Eigentlich und bei Lichte besehen sei doch jeder Geschäftsmann ein Gauner … du, selbst ein Kaufmann, Angehöriger einer Firma, die aus allen Kräften nach absoluter Integrität, nach makelloser Solidität strebt …«","""You signed up for . . .

Now, listen to me!” the consul shouted, stretching both hands before him, palms up, and he tilted his head to one side, giving it a demonstrative and excited shake. “There you are surrounded by both business and professional men, where everyone can hear you, and you say, ‘Seen in the light of day, actually, every businessman is a swindler’—you, who are a businessman yourself, a part of a firm that strives with might and main for absolute integrity, for a spotless reputation.”","""You were ashamed--you, were--!

Aber ich habe gemerkt, daß sie zerfahren, untüchtig und haltlos macht … und die Haltung, das Gleichgewicht ist für mich meinerseits die Hauptsache. Es wird immer Menschen geben, die zu diesem Interesse an sich selbst, diesem eingehenden Beobachten ihrer Empfindungen berechtigt sind, Dichter, die ihr bevorzugtes Innenleben mit Sicherheit und Schönheit auszusprechen vermögen und damit die Gefühlswelt der anderen Leute bereichern. Aber wir sind bloß einfache Kaufleute, mein Kind; unsere Selbstbeobachtungen sind verzweifelt unbeträchtlich. Wir können zur Not hervorbringen, daß das Stimmen von Orchesterinstrumenten uns ein merkwürdiges Vergnügen macht, und daß wir manchmal nicht wagen, schlucken zu wollen … Ach, wir sollen uns hinsetzen, zum Teufel, und etwas leisten, wie unsere Vorfahren etwas geleistet haben …«","""Let me tell you something,"" he continued after a pause, throwing his cigarette through the wrought-iron door into the stove...

But we are only simple merchants, my child; our introspections are desperately insignificant. We can bring out, if need be, that tuning orchestral instruments gives us a strange pleasure, and that sometimes we dare not swallow... Ah, let's sit down, the hell, and do something as our ancestors did something...""","“I want to tell you something,” he continued after a pause, during which he tossed his cigarette through the wrought-iron grate into the stove. “I have occasionally given some thought to that sort of useless curiosity and preoccupation with one’s self—because I tended to be that way myself at one time. But I realized that it left me unstable, erratic, out of control. And for me the important thing is control and balance. There will always be people for whom this sort of interest in oneself, this probing observation of one’s own sensibilities, is appropriate—poets, for instance, who are capable of expressing the inner life, which they prize so much, with assurance and beauty, thereby enriching the emotional life of other people. But we are just simple merchants, my dear; our self-observations are dreadfully petty. At the very best, all we are capable of saying is that we take some special delight in hearing the orchestra tune up, or that we sometimes can’t bring ourselves to swallow. But what we should do, damn it, is to sit ourselves down and accomplish something, just as our forebears did.”","""I'll tell you,"" he went on after a pause, throwing his cig-arette through the wrought-iron lattice into the stove: ""I have thought a great deal about this curious and useless self-prroccupation, because I had once an inclination to it myself.

There will always be men who are Justified in this interest in themselves, this detailed observation of their own emotions; poets who can express with clarity and beauty their privileged inner life, and thereby enrich the emotional world of other people. But the likes of us are simple mer-chants, my child; our self-observations are decidedly inconsid-erable.

"Wie hatten diese beiden sich gefunden, und wie standen sie zueinander? Man erinnerte sich der jähen Entschlossenheit, mit der vor achtzehn Jahren der damals dreißigjährige Thomas Buddenbrook zu Werke gegangen war. »Diese oder keine«, das war sein Wort gewesen, und es mußte sich mit Gerda wohl ähnlich verhalten haben, denn sie hatte in Amsterdam bis zu ihrem siebenundzwanzigsten Jahre Körbe ausgeteilt und diesen Bewerber alsbald erhört. Eine Liebesheirat also, dachten die Leute in ihrem Sinne; denn so schwer es ihnen wurde, mußten sie einräumen, daß Gerdas Dreihunderttausend doch wohl nur eine Rolle zweiten Ranges bei der Sache gespielt hatten. Allein von Liebe wiederum, von dem, was man unter Liebe verstand, war zwischen den beiden von Anbeginn höchst wenig zu spüren gewesen. Von Anbeginn vielmehr hatte man nichts als Höflichkeit in ihrem Umgang konstatiert, eine zwischen Gatten ganz außerordentliche, korrekte und respektvolle Höflichkeit, die aber unverständlicherweise nicht aus innerer Fernheit und Fremdheit, sondern aus einer sehr eigenartigen, stummen und tiefen gegenseitigen Vertrautheit und Kenntnis, einer beständigen gegenseitigen Rücksicht und Nachsicht hervorzugehen schien. Daran hatten die Jahre nicht das geringste geändert. Die Änderung, die sie hervorgebracht hatten, bestand nur darin, daß jetzt der Altersunterschied der beiden, so selten geringfügig er den Jahren nach war, anfing, in auffälliger Weise hervorzutreten …","How did these two find each other, and how did they relate to each other? One remembered the abrupt determination with which Thomas Buddenbrook, then thirty, had gone to work eighteen years earlier. ""These or none,"" that was his word, and it must have been the same with Gerda, for she had handed out rejections in Amsterdam up to the age of twenty-seven and immediately accepted this suitor. A love marriage, then, people thought along their lines; for as difficult as it was for them, they had to admit that Gerda's three hundred thousand had only played a secondary role in the matter. From the very beginning there had been very little trace of love between the two of what was meant by love. From the very beginning, nothing but politeness was noted in their dealings, a quite extraordinary, correct and respectful politeness between husband and wife, which, however, incomprehensibly does not come from inner distance and strangeness, but from a very peculiar, mute and deep mutual intimacy and knowledge, a constant mutual consideration and forbearance. The years hadn't changed that in the slightest. The only change they had brought about was that now the difference in age between the two, seldom slight as it was over the years, began to stand out in a conspicuous way...","How had these two found one another, and what kind of rapport did they have with one another? People could remember with what firm, sudden resolve Thomas Buddenbrook had gone about wooing her. “This woman or none,” he had said, and it must have been more or less the same for Gerda, too, because, until she was twenty-seven, she had rebuffed every suitor in Amsterdam—and then suddenly had accepted this one. A marriage of love, people were forced to conclude, for although they admitted that Gerda’s three hundred thousand had played a role, they knew it was merely secondary. But when it came to love, to what people understood as love, there had been very few indications of that in their marriage. Instead, from the very beginning, people had noticed only a kind of courtesy in the way they treated one another, a very correct and respectful courtesy quite uncommon between man and wife, which seemed to have its origins not in emotional distance and estrangement but, rather, in a most peculiar, silent, and profound mutual trust in and knowledge of one another, in never-failing consideration and tolerance. And the passing years had not changed that in the least. The only change that time had brought could be found in the difference in their ages, which, although it was quite small when measured in years, had began to show itself in obvious ways.","How had these two come to marry, and what sort of relationship was theirs? Everybody remembered the sudden re-solve of Thomas Buddenbrook eighteen years ago, when he was thirty years old. "" This one or no one,"" he had said. It must have been something of the same sort with Gerda, for it was well known that she had refused everybody up to her twenty-seventh year, and then forthwith lent an ear to this particular wooer. It must have been a love match, people said: they granted that the three hundred thousand thaler had probably not played much of a role. But of that which any ordinary person would call love, there was very little to be seen between the pair. They had displayed from the very beginning a correct, respectful politeness, quite ex-traordinary between husband and wife. And what was still more odd it seemed not to proceed out of any inner estrangement, but out of a peculiar, silent, deep mutual knowledge. This had not at all altered with the years. The one change due to the passage of time was an outward one. It was only this: that the difference in years began to make itself plainly risible."

"Übrigens war kaum Gefahr vorhanden, diese Stimmung möchte durch einen Laut jugendlichen Übermutes zerrissen werden. Ein Blick hätte genügt, zu bemerken, daß fast alle Glieder der hier versammelten Familie in einem Alter standen, in welchem die Lebensäußerungen längst gesetzte Formen angenommen haben. Senator Thomas Buddenbrook, dessen Blässe den wachen, energischen und sogar humoristischen Ausdruck seines Gesichtes Lügen strafte; Gerda, seine Gattin, welche, unbeweglich in einem Sessel zurückgelehnt und das schöne, weiße Gesicht nach oben gewandt, ihre nahe beieinanderliegenden, bläulich umschatteten, seltsam schimmernden Augen von den flimmernden Glasprismen des Kronleuchters bannen ließ; seine Schwester, Frau Permaneder; Jürgen Kröger, sein Kousin, der stille, schlicht gekleidete Beamte; seine Kusinen Friederike, Henriette und Pfiffi, von denen die beiden ersteren noch magerer und länger geworden waren und die letztere noch kleiner und beleibter erschien als früher, denen aber ein stereotyper Gesichtsausdruck durchaus gemeinsam war, ein spitziges und übelwollendes Lächeln, das gegen alle Personen und Dinge mit einer allgemeinen medisanten Skepsis gerichtet war, als sagten sie beständig: »Wirklich? Das möchten wir denn doch fürs erste noch bezweifeln« …; schließlich die arme, aschgraue Klothilde, deren Gedanken wohl direkt auf das Abendessen gerichtet waren: – sie alle hatten die Vierzig überschritten, während die Hausherrin mit ihrem Bruder Justus und seiner Frau gleich der kleinen Therese Weichbrodt schon ziemlich weit über die Sechzig hinaus war, und die alte Konsulin Buddenbrook, geborene Stüwing, sowie die gänzlich taube Madame Kethelsen, sich schon in den Siebzigern befanden.","Incidentally, there was hardly any danger; this mood might be torn apart by a sound of youthful high spirits. A glance would have sufficed to notice that almost all the members of the family gathered here were of an age when the expressions of life had long since taken on established forms. Senator Thomas Buddenbrook, whose pallor belied the alert, energetic, and even humorous expression on his face; Gerda, his wife, who, leaning back motionless in an armchair and turning her beautiful white face upwards, allowed her close-set, bluish-shadowed, strangely shimmering eyes to be fascinated by the flickering glass prisms of the chandelier; his sister, Mrs. Permaneder; Jürgen Kröger, his cousin, the quiet, plainly dressed official; his cousins Friederike, Henriette and Pfiffi, of whom the first two had grown even thinner and taller and the latter appeared even smaller and corpulent than before, but they all had a stereotypical facial expression in common, a pointed and malevolent smile that was directed at everyone and things with a general meditative skepticism, as if they kept saying, ""Really? We would like to doubt that for the time being«...; finally poor, ash-grey Klothilde, whose thoughts were probably directed straight towards supper: – they were all over forty, while the lady of the house, her brother Justus and his wife, like little Therese Weichbrodt, were already well over sixty, and the old Consul Buddenbrook, née Stuwing, and the completely deaf Madame Kethelsen, were already in their seventies.","Not that there was any real danger the mood would be broken by the noise of youthful high spirits. One look sufficed to reveal that almost all members of the assembled family were of an age when manifestations of conviviality have assumed time-honored forms. There was Senator Thomas Buddenbrook, whose alert, spirited, even humorous expression was contradicted by the pallor of his face; his wife, Gerda, leaning back in her armchair, immobile, her lovely white face turned upward, her close-set, blue-shadowed eyes glistening strangely under the spell of the flickering light of the chandelier’s crystal prisms; his sister, Frau Permaneder; his cousin Jürgen Kröger, the quiet, neatly dressed civil servant; his cousins Friederike, Henriette, and Pfiffi, the first two looking skinnier and taller than ever, the latter shorter and plumper, but all three with faces set in one standard expression—a caustic, malevolent smile disparagingly directed at all persons and things, as if they had but one constant, skeptical question: “ Really? Well, for the present, we choose to doubt it.” And finally there was poor ash-gray Klothilde, whose thoughts were probably focused on dinner. They were all over forty—and the hostess, her brother Justus, his wife, and Therese Weichbrodt well over sixty. And both Gotthold’s widow—old Madame Buddenbrook, née Stüwing—and the now totally deaf Madame Kethelsen were already in their seventies.","There was really no danger that the solemnity of the feast would be rudely broken in upon by youthful high spirits. A glance showed that almost all the persons in the room were arrived at an age when the forms of expression are already long ago fixed. Senator Thomas Buddenbrook, whose pallor gave the lie to his alert, energetic, humorous expres-sion; Gerda, his wife, leaning back in her chair, the gleaming, blue-ringed eyes in her pale face gazing fixedly at the crystal prisms in the chandelier; his sister, Frau Permaneder; his cousin, Ju'rgen Kroger, a quiet, neatly-dressed official; Friederike, Henriette, and Pfiffi, the first two more long and lean, the third smaller and plumper than ever, but all three wearing their stereotyped expression, their sharp, spiteful smile at everything and everybody, as though they were per-petually saying ""Really--it seems incredible!"" Lastly, there was poor, ashen-grey Clothilde, whose thoughts were probably fixed upon the coming meal.--Every one of these persons was past forty. The hostess herself, her brother Justus and his wife, and little Therese Weichbrodt were all well past sixty; while old Frau Consul Buddenbrook, Uncle Gotthold's widow, born Sliiwing, as well aa Madame Kethelsen, now, alas almost entirely deaf, were already in the seventies."

"Mit dem Typhus ist es folgendermaßen bestellt: In die fernen Fieberträume, in die glühende Verlorenheit des Kranken wird das Leben hineingerufen mit unverkennbarer, ermunternder Stimme. Hart und frisch wird diese Stimme den Geist auf dem fremden, heißen Wege erreichen, auf dem er vorwärts wandelt, und der in den Schatten, die Kühle, den Frieden führt. Aufhorchend wird der Mensch diese helle, muntere, ein wenig höhnische Mahnung zur Umkehr und Rückkehr vernehmen, die aus jener Gegend zu ihm dringt, die er so weit zurückgelassen und schon vergessen hatte. Wallt es dann auf in ihm, wie ein Gefühl der feigen Pflichtversäumnis, der Scham, der erneuten Energie, des Mutes und der Freude, der Liebe und Zugehörigkeit zu dem spöttischen, bunten und brutalen Getriebe, das er im Rücken gelassen: wie weit er auch auf dem fremden, heißen Pfade fortgeirrt sein mag, er wird umkehren und leben. Aber zuckt er zusammen vor Furcht und Abneigung bei der Stimme des Lebens, die er vernimmt, bewirkt diese Erinnerung, dieser lustige, herausfordernde Laut, daß er den Kopf schüttelt und in Abwehr die Hand hinter sich streckt und sich vorwärts flüchtet auf dem Wege, der sich ihm zum Entrinnen eröffnet hat … nein, es ist klar, dann wird er sterben. –","With typhoid it is as follows: In the distant feverish dreams, in the glowing forlornness of the patient, life is called with an unmistakable, encouraging voice. Hard and fresh, this voice will reach the spirit on the strange, hot path on which it walks forward, and which leads to shadow, coolness, peace. Listening attentively, people will hear this bright, lively, somewhat mocking admonition to turn around and return, which comes to them from that region which they have left so far behind and already forgotten. It then surges up in him like a feeling of cowardly dereliction of duty, shame, renewed energy, courage and joy, love and belonging to the mocking, colorful and brutal machinations he has left behind: however far he may go may have strayed on the strange, hot path, he will turn back and live. But if he flinches in fear and aversion at the voice of life he hears, that memory, that jolly, challenging sound, makes him shake his head and put his hand behind him in defense and flee forward along the path that opened up to him for escape... no, of course, then he will die. –","Typhoid runs the following course: As he lies in remote, feverish dreams, lost in their heat, the patient is called back to life by an unmistakable, cheering voice. That clear, fresh voice reaches his spirit wandering along strange, hot paths and leads it back to cooling shade and peace. The patient listens to that bright, cheering voice, hears its slightly derisive admonishment to turn back, to return to the regions from which it calls, to places that the patient has left so far behind and has already forgotten. And then, if there wells up within him something like a sense of duties neglected, a sense of shame, of renewed energy, of courage, joy, and love, a feeling that he still belongs to that curious, colorful, and brutal hubbub that he has left behind—then, however far he may have strayed down that strange, hot path, he will turn back and live. But if he hears the voice of life and shies from it, fearful and reticent, if the memories awakened by its lusty challenge only make him shake his head and stretch out his hand to ward them off, if he flees farther down the path that opens before him now as a route of escape—no, it is clear, he will die.","Cases of typhoid take the following course: When the fever is at its height, life calls to the patient: calls out to him as he wanders in his distant dream, and summons him m no uncertain voice. The harsh, imperious call reaches the spirit on that remote path that leads into the shadows, the coolness and peace. He hears the call of life, the clear, fresh, mocking summons to return to that distant scene which he has already left so far behind him, and already forgotten.

Did he soon tire of conferring with his Creator and Sustainer? What a robbery of Him, the Lord, to stop in writing even now... No, no, as punishment for his impious lusts, he quoted longer passages from the scriptures, prayed for his parents, his wife, his children, and himself , also prayed for his brother Gotthold, - and finally, after one last verse from the Bible and one last threefold Amen, he sprinkled gold sand on the writing and leaned back with a sigh of relief.","Two pages later, it read: “I have had a policy written for my youngest daughter in the amount of 150 courant-thalers. Lead her, O Lord, in Thy ways, and give her a pure heart, that she may one day enter the mansions of eternal peace. For we well know how difficult it is to believe with all one’s soul that sweet Jesus is ours alone, for how small are our earthly hearts.…” Three pages later, the consul added his “amen,” but the pen continued to glide, gently rustling across several more pages, describing the precious fount that quenches the thirst of the weary wanderer, the sacred and bloody wounds of the Redeemer, the narrow way and the broad way, and God’s great glory. It cannot be denied that after one or another of these statements the consul sensed that enough was enough and he should put his pen aside and go in to his wife, or to his office. But how could he! Was he so quickly weary of communing with his Creator and Redeemer? To break off now would be as good as stealing from the Lord. No, no, as chastisement for such ungodly desires he quoted more long passages from Holy Scripture, prayed for his parents, his wife, his children, and himself, prayed as well for his brother, Gotthold—and finally, after one last Bible verse and a final threefold amen, he dusted the page with gold-sand and leaned back with a sigh of relief.","I have taken out,"" it said, ""an insurance policy for my youngest daughter, of one hundred and fifty thaler current. Lead her, O Lord, in Thy ways, give her a pure heart, O God, that she may one day enter into the mansions of eternal peace. For inasmuch as our weak human hearts are prone to forget Thy priceless gift of the sweet, blessed Jesus..."" And so on for three pages. Then he wrote ""Amen."" But still the faint scratching sound of the pen went on, over several more pages. It wrote of the precious spring that refreshes the tired wanderer, of the Saviour's holy wounds gushing blood, of the broad way and the narrow way, and the glory of the Eternal God. It is true that after a while the Consul began to feel that he had written enough; that he might let well enough alone, and go in to see his wife, or out to the counting-house. Oh, fie, fie! Did one so soon weary of communion with his Lord and Saviour? Was it not robbing his God to scant Him of this service? No, he would go on, as a chastisement for these unholy im-pulses. He cited whole pages of Scripture, he prayed for his parents, his wife, his children, and himself, he prayed even for his brother Gotthold. And then, with a last quotation and three final ""Amens,"" he strewed sand on the paper and leaned back with a sigh of relief."

"Die widerlichen Einzelheiten dieses Todesfalles wurden von der Familie nach Möglichkeit geheimgehalten; aber sie verbreiteten sich rasch in der Stadt und bildeten den Gesprächsstoff an der Börse, im »Klub«, in der »Harmonie«, in den Kontors, in der Bürgerschaft und auf den Bällen, Diners und Abendgesellschaften, denn das Ereignis fiel in den Februar – den Februar des Jahres 62 – und das gesellschaftliche Leben war noch in vollem Gange. Selbst die Freundinnen der Konsulin Buddenbrook erzählten sich am »Jerusalemsabend« von Senator Möllendorpfs Tode, wenn Lea Gerhardt im Vorlesen eine Pause machte, selbst die kleinen Sonntagsschülerinnen flüsterten davon, wenn sie ehrfürchtig über die große Buddenbrooksche Diele gingen, und Herr Stuht in der Glockengießerstraße hatte mit seiner Frau, die in den ersten Kreisen verkehrte, eine ausführliche Unterredung darüber.","The sickening details of this death were kept secret by the family as much as possible; but they quickly spread through the city and formed the subject of conversation at the stock exchange, in the ""club,"" in the ""harmony,"" in the offices, in the town council, and at the balls, dinners, and evening parties, for the event fell in February - February of the year 62 - and social life was still in full swing.

Even the women who gathered for Madame Buddenbrook’s Jerusalem Evenings would start to talk about Senator Möllendorpf’s death whenever Lea Gerhardt took a break in her reading; in fact, the little Sunday-school pupils whispered about it as they reverentially crossed the Buddenbrooks’ vast entrance hall; and Herr Stuht in Glockengiesser Strasse had an extended discussion about it with his wife, who moved in the highest social circles.","The horrid details of the death were kept as much as pos-sible from the family, but they flew about the town, and were discussed at length on the Bourse, in the club, and at the Harmony, in all the business offices, in the Assembly of Bur-gesses--likewise at all the balls, dinners, and evening parties, for the death occurred in February of the year '62, and the season was in full swing.

"Das Gefängnisleben hatte seiner körperlichen Gesundheit nichts anhaben können, denn Hugo Weinschenk war stets von durabler Konstitution gewesen; aber es stand doch äußerst traurig um ihn. Es war entsetzlich, zu sehen, wie dieser Mann – der höchstwahrscheinlich nichts anderes begangen hatte, als was die meisten seiner Kollegen ringsum mit gutem Mut alle Tage begingen, und der, wäre er nicht ertappt worden, ohne Zweifel erhobenen Hauptes und unberührt heiteren Gewissens seinen Pfad gewandert wäre – durch seinen bürgerlichen Fall, durch die Tatsache der gerichtlichen Verurteilung und diese drei Gefängnisjahre nun moralisch so vollkommen gebrochen war. Er hatte vor Gericht aus tiefster Überzeugung beteuert, und von Sachverständigen war es ihm bestätigt worden, daß das kecke Manöver, welches er seiner Gesellschaft und sich selbst zu Ehr' und Vorteil unternommen, in der Geschäftswelt als Usance gelte. Die Juristen aber, Herren, die nach seiner eigenen Meinung von diesen Dingen gar nichts verstanden, die unter ganz anderen Begriffen und in einer ganz anderen Weltanschauung lebten, hatten ihn wegen Betruges verurteilt, und dieser Spruch, dem die staatliche Macht zur Seite stand, hatte seine Selbstschätzung dermaßen zu erschüttern vermocht, daß er niemandem mehr ins Angesicht zu blicken wagte. Sein federnder Gang, die unternehmende Art, mit der er sich in der Taille seines Gehrockes gewiegt, mit den Fäusten balanciert und die Augen gerollt hatte, die ungemeine Frische, mit der er von der Höhe seiner Unwissenheit und Unbildung herab seine Fragen und Erzählungen zum besten gegeben hatte – alles war dahin! Es war so sehr dahin, daß den Seinen vor so viel Gedrücktheit, Feigheit und dumpfer Würdelosigkeit graute.","Life in prison had not affected his physical health, for Hugo Weinschenk had always had a durable constitution; but it was extremely sad for him. It was horrifying to see this man - who most likely had done nothing more than what most of his fellow colleagues around him did in good spirits every day, and who, had he not been caught, would no doubt do it with his head held high and his conscience untouched path - was now so completely morally broken by his civil case, by the fact of the court conviction and these three years in prison. He had testified in court from the deepest conviction, and it had been confirmed by experts, that the daring maneuver which he had undertaken for the honor and advantage of his society and himself was considered customary in the business world. But the lawyers, gentlemen, who in his own opinion understood nothing at all about these things, who lived under completely different concepts and in a completely different world view, had sentenced him for fraud, and this sentence, which was supported by the state power, had so shaken his self-esteem that he dared not look anyone in the face. His springy gait, the enterprising way in which he swayed in the waist of his frock coat, balanced with his fists and rolled his eyes, the uncommon freshness with which he answered his questions and stories from the height of his ignorance and ignorance had given - everything was gone! It was so gone that his family dreaded so much oppression, cowardice and dull indignity.","Life in prison had not affected Hugo Weinschenk’s physical health—he had always been a man of rugged constitution. But he was in a very sad state nonetheless. The man had probably done nothing worse than what most of his colleagues blithely did every day; and if he had not been caught at it, he would doubtless have gone his way with head held high and a perfectly easy conscience. But disgrace in the eyes of his fellow citizens, a guilty verdict in a court of law, and three years in prison had left him a morally broken man. With heartfelt conviction, he had assured the court that the clever measures he had undertaken for the benefit of his insurance company had been to its advantage as well as his own, that it was no more than usage in the world of business—and expert witnesses had confirmed this. The lawyers, however, were gentlemen who, in his opinion, understood nothing about such matters, they lived in a different world; and, proceeding from a totally different perspective, they judged him guilty of fraud—a verdict backed up by the power of the state. All of which had so shattered his self-confidence that he now dared not look anyone in the eye. The spring in his step, the enterprising swing in his stride as he walked along in his frock coat, fists balanced in front of him, eyes roving, the enormous vigor with which he asked questions and told anecdotes from the heights of unschooled ignorance—it was all gone now. And his family shuddered at the despondency, cowardice, and lack of self-respect that had replaced it.","He had always had a very strong constitution, and the prison life could hardly have impaired his physical health. But his condition was, none the less, pitiable in the extreme. This man had in all probability done no more than his business colleagues did every day and thought nothing of; if he had not been caught, he would have gone on his way with head erect and conscience clear. Yet it was dreadful to see how his ruin as a citizen, the judicial correction, and the three years' imprisonment, had operated to break down his morale. His testimony before the court had been given with the most sincere conviction; and people who understood the techni-calities of the case supported his contention that he had merely executed a bold manreuvre for the credit of his firm and him-self--a manreuvre known in the business world as usance. The lawyers who had convicted him knew, in his opinion, nothing whatever about such things and lived in quite a differ-ent world. But their conviction, endorsed by the governing power of the state, had shattered his selfesteem to such a degree that he could not look anybody in the face. Cone was his elastic tread, the way he had of wriggling at the waist of his frock-coat and balancing with his fists and rolling his eyes about. Gone was the ignorant self-assurance with which he had delivered his uniformed opinions and put his questions. The change was such that his family shuddered at it--and in-deed it was frightful to see such cowardice, dejection, and lack of self-respect."

"Sein körperliches Befinden hatte sich verschlechtert. Appetit- und Schlaflosigkeit, Schwindel und jene Schüttelfröste, zu denen er immer geneigt hatte, zwangen ihn mehrere Male, Doktor Langhals zu Rate zu ziehen. Aber er gelangte nicht dazu, des Arztes Verordnungen zu befolgen. Seine Willenskraft, in Jahren voll geschäftiger und gehetzter Tatenlosigkeit angegriffen, reichte nicht aus dazu. Er hatte begonnen, am Morgen sehr lange zu schlafen, obgleich er jeden Abend den zornigen Entschluß faßte, sich früh zu erheben, um den anbefohlenen Spaziergang vorm Tee zu machen. In Wirklichkeit führte er dies zwei- oder dreimal aus … und so ging es in all und jeder Sache. Die beständige Anspannung des Willens ohne Erfolg und Genugtuung zehrte an seiner Selbstachtung und stimmte ihn verzweifelt. Er war weit entfernt, sich den betäubenden Genuß der kleinen, scharfen, russischen Zigaretten zu versagen, die er, seit seiner Jugend schon, täglich in Massen rauchte.

He had begun to sleep very late in the mornings, although each evening he made an angry determination to get up early to take the bidden walk before tea. In fact, he did this two or three times... and so it went in everything and everything. The constant strain of will without success or satisfaction sapped his self-esteem and made him desperate.

He said straight to Doctor Longneck into his vain face: “You see, doctor, it is your duty to forbid me to smoke cigarettes… a very easy and very pleasant duty, really! Holding the ban is my business! you can watch it... No, we want to work together on my health, but the roles are distributed too unfairly, I have too much of a part in this work! Don't laugh... This isn't a joke... It's so terribly alone... I smoke. may I ask?'","His physical health had grown worse. He had little appetite and trouble sleeping; chills, which had always been a problem, now forced him to consult Dr. Langhals on several occasions. But he never managed to follow the doctor’s medical advice. His strength of will, shaky now after years of fussy, harassed inactivity, was no longer up to the task. He had begun to sleep very late of a morning, although each evening he would angrily resolve to rise early and take the walk before his morning tea that the doctor had suggested. But he actually followed through only two or three times—and it was much the same with everything else. All of this meant a constant strain on his will, and it brought him neither success nor a sense of satisfaction—only gnawed away at his self-respect and left him feeling desperate. He was not about to try to give up the narcotic pleasure of his pungent little Russian cigarettes—he had smoked them in great quantities since his youth. He told Dr. Langhals straight out, right to his conceited face, “You see, doctor, it is your duty to forbid me my cigarettes, a very easy and very pleasant duty indeed. But obeying that prohibition is up to me—you must realize that. No, we shall work together on my health, but the roles have been unevenly divided, and I end up with much the larger share of work to do. Don’t laugh— that’s not a joke. A man is so dreadfully alone. And so I smoke. May I offer you one?”","His health had failed. Loss of appetite, sleeplessness, diz- zin ess, and the chills to which he had always been subject forced him several times to call in Dr. Langhals. But he did not follow the doctor's orders. His will-power had grown flabby in these years of idlenes or petty activity. He slept late in the morning, though every evening he made an angry resold to rise early and take the prescribed walk before breakfast. Only two or three times did he actually carry out the resolve; and it was the same with everything else. And the constant effort to spur on his will, with the constant failure to do so. consumed his self-respect and made him a prey to despair. He never even tried to give up his cigarettes; he could not do without the pleasant narcotic effect; he had smoked them from his youth up. He told Dr. Langhals to his vapid face: ""You see, Doctor, it is your duty to forbid me cigarettes--a very easy and agreeable duty. But I have to obey the order--that is my share, and you can look on at it. No, we will work together over my health; but I find the work un-evenly divided--too much of yours falls to me. Don't laugh: it is no joke. One is so frightfully alone--well, I smoke. Will you have one?"""

The thought occurs to me that I can’t swallow, and then I really can’t. What I’ve eaten is clear at the back of my mouth, but these muscles here, along the neck—they just won’t work. They won’t obey my will, you see. Or, better, the fact is: I can’t bring myself to actually will it.”","Suddenly he said: ""Strange--sometimes I can't swallow. Dh, it's no joke. I find it very serious. It enters my head that perhaps I can't swallow, and then all of a sudden I can't. The food is already swallowed, but the muscles--right here--they simply refuse. It isn't a question of will-power. Or rather, the thing is, I don't dare really will it."""
"Dann blieb er am Tische stehen, und während er sich ein wenig darüber hin seiner Schwester entgegenbeugte und mit der Spitze des gekrümmten Zeigefingers leicht auf die Platte schlug, sagte er: »Ich werde dir mal eine Geschichte erzählen, meine liebe Tony, die dir zeigen soll, wie ich mich zu dieser Sache verhalte. Ich kenne dein faible für den Adel im allgemeinen und die mecklenburgische Noblesse im besonderen, und darum bitte ich dich um Geduld, wenn in meiner Geschichte einer dieser Herren einen Denkzettel erhält … Du weißt, unter ihnen ist dieser und jener, der den Kaufleuten, obgleich sie ihm doch so nötig sind wie er ihnen, nicht allzuviel Hochachtung entgegenbringt, die – bis zu einem gewissen Grade anzuerkennende – Überlegenheit des Produzenten über den Zwischenhändler im geschäftlichen Verkehre allzusehr betont und, kurz, den Kaufmann mit nicht sehr anderen Augen ansieht als den hausierenden Juden, dem man, mit dem Bewußtsein, übervorteilt zu werden, getragene Kleider überläßt. Ich schmeichle mir, im allgemeinen den Eindruck eines moralisch minderwertigen Ausbeuters auf die Herren nicht gemacht zu haben, und habe unter ihnen weit zähere Händler angetroffen, als ich bin. Bei einem aber bedurfte es erst des folgenden kleinen Gewaltstreichs, um mich ihm gesellschaftlich ein wenig näher zu bringen … Es war der Herr von Groß-Poggendorf, von dem du gewiß gehört hast, und mit dem ich vor Jahr und Tag vielfach zu tun hatte: Graf Strelitz, ein höchst feudaler Mann mit einem viereckigen Glas im Auge … ich begriff niemals, daß er sich nicht schnitt … lackierten Stulpstiefeln und einer Reitpeitsche mit goldenem Griff. Er hatte die Gewohnheit, mit halb geöffnetem Munde und halb geschlossenen Augen von einer unbegreiflichen Höhe auf mich herabzublicken … Mein erster Besuch bei ihm war bedeutsam. Nach einer einleitenden Korrespondenz fuhr ich zu ihm und trat, vom Bedienten gemeldet, ins Arbeitszimmer. Graf Strelitz saß am Schreibtisch. Er erwidert meine Verbeugung, indem er sich halbwegs vom Sessel erhebt, schreibt die letzte Zeile eines Briefes, wendet sich dann zu mir, indem er über mich hinwegsieht, und beginnt die Unterhandlungen über seine Ware. Ich lehne am Sofatische, kreuze Arme und Beine und bin amüsiert. Ich stehe fünf Minuten lang im Gespräche. Nach weiteren fünf Minuten setze ich mich auf den Tisch und lasse ein Bein in der Luft schaukeln. Unsere Verhandlungen nehmen ihren Fortgang, und nach Verlauf einer Viertelstunde sagt er mit einer wirklich gnädigen Handbewegung leichthin: »Wollen Sie nicht übrigens einen Stuhl nehmen?« – »Wie?« sagte ich … »Oh, nicht nötig! Ich sitze längst.«","Then he stopped at the table, and leaning a little over to meet his sister and tapping the plate lightly with the tip of his crooked forefinger, he said: 'I'll tell you a story, my dear Tony, that I'll show you how I should relate to this matter. I know your soft spot for the nobility in general and the Mecklenburg noblesse in particular, and so I ask you to be patient if one of these gentlemen in my story receives a memo... You know, among them is this and that, the one for the merchants, albeit they are as necessary to him as he is to them, does not show too much respect for them, emphasizes too much the superiority of the producer over the middleman in business dealings, which is to a certain extent recognisable, and, in short, looks at the merchant with not very different eyes than at the peddler Jews who are given worn clothes in the knowledge that they are being cheated. I flatter myself that in general I did not give the gentlemen the impression of a morally inferior exploiter, and I have found among them much tougher traders than I am. With one, however, it took the following little act of violence to bring me a little closer to him socially ... It was Herr von Groß-Poggendorf, whom you have certainly heard of and with whom I had dealings many years ago: Count Strelitz, a supremely feudal man with a square glass in his eye...I never understood that he didn't cut himself...lacquered top boots and a riding crop with a gold handle. He was in the habit of looking down at me from an incomprehensible height, with his mouth half open and his eyes half closed... My first visit to him was significant. After an introductory correspondence, I drove to him and, announced by the servant, went into the study. Count Strelitz was sitting at his desk. He returns my bow by rising halfway from the chair, writes the last line of a letter, then turns to me, ignoring me, and begins negotiating his merchandise. I lean against the coffee table, cross my arms and legs and am amused. I'm talking for five minutes. After another five minutes I sit down on the table and let one leg swing in the air. Our negotiations continue, and after a quarter of an hour he says with a really gracious wave of his hand: ""Wouldn't you like to take a chair, by the way?"" ""How?"" I said... ""Oh, not necessary! I've been sitting for a long time.""","Then he stopped beside the table and, bending down toward his sister and lightly tapping the tabletop with a crooked index finger, said, “Let me tell you a little story, my dear Tony, one that will show you how I feel about this entire matter. I know your weakness for the nobility in general and the aristocrats of Mecklenburg in particular, and so I beg your indulgence if one of those gentlemen gets his fingers rapped in my story. You know, I’m sure, that among them there are one or two who do not have all that much regard for merchants, although merchants are as vital to them as vice versa. Men of that sort lay a bit too much emphasis on the producer’s superior position—which to some extent is undeniable—vis-à-vis the wholesaler in commercial transactions; and, indeed, they regard the merchant with much the same eyes as they would a Jewish peddler to whom one gives one’s worn-out clothing, even though one is quite aware that he has the better of the deal. I flatter myself that in general I have not left these gentlemen with the impression that I am an exploiter and their moral inferior; indeed, I’ve run across some who drive a much harder bargain than I. But it took just one little bold stroke, which I shall now tell you about, to bring me a bit closer on the social scale to one such fellow. It was Count Strelitz, whose estate was Gross-Poggendorf—you’ve heard of him before, I’m sure. I dealt with him for years, in fact. A very aristocratic sort, with a square monocle clamped in his eye—I could never figure out why he didn’t cut himself—wore patent-leather boots and carried a riding crop with a gold handle. He had a habit of gazing down at me from some lofty height, his mouth half open, his eyes half closed. My first visit was very significant. We exchanged some introductory correspondence; I went to see him, and was ushered by his butler into his study, where I found him seated at his desk. He responds to my bow by raising himself halfway up in his chair, and finishes the last lines of a letter. He then turns to me, looking right on past me, and strikes up negotiations about his grain. I lean back against the table next to the sofa, cross my arms and legs, and find this all quite amusing. I stand there conversing with him for some five minutes. Five minutes more pass and I sit down on the table, with one leg dangling in the air. Our negotiations continue, and after fifteen minutes, with a truly gracious wave of his hand, he casually says, ‘Won’t you have a seat?’—‘Beg your pardon?’ I say. ‘ Oh, that’s not necessary. I’ve been sitting all along.’ ”","He paused by the table and turned toward his sister, drumming lightly on the surface with his bent forefinger as he said: ""I'll tell you a little story, my dear Tony, which will illustrate my attitude toward this affair. I know your weakness for the nobility, and the Mecklenburg nobility in particular--please don't mind if one of these gentry gets rapped a bit. You know, there is now and then one among them who doesn't treat the merchant classes with any great respect, though perfectly aware that he can't do without them. Such a man is too much inclined to lay stress on the superiority--to a certain extent undeniable--of the producer over the middleman. In short, he sometimes acts as if the merchant were like a peddling Jew to whom one sells old clothes, quite conscious that one is being over-reached. I flatter myself that in my dealings with these gentry I have not usually made the impression of a morally in-ferior exploiter; to tell the truth, the boot has sometimes been on the other foot-- I've run across men who were far less scrupulous than I am! But in one case, it only needed a single bold stroke to bring me into social relations. The man was the lord of Gross-Poggendorf, of whom you have surely heard. I had considerable dealings with him some while back: Count Strelitz, a very smart-appearing man, with a square eye-glass (I could never make out why he did not cut himself), patent-leather top-hoots, and a riding-whip with a gold handle. He had a way of looking down at me from a great height, with his eyes half shut and his mouth half open. My first visit to him was very telling. We had had some correspondence. I drove over, and was ushered by a servant into the study, where Count Strelitz was sitting at his writing-table. He returns my bow, half gets up, finishes the last lines of a letter; then he turns to me and be-gins to talk business, looking over the top of my head. I lean on the sofa-table, cross my arms and my legs, and enjoy myself. I stand five minutes talking. After another five minutes, I sit down on the table and swing my leg. We get on with our business, and at the end of fifteen minutes he says to me, very graciously, 'won't you sit down?' 'Beg pardon?' I say. ' Oh, don't mention it--I've been sitting for some time!'

"Thomas' angestrengte Tätigkeit, der Zustand seiner Nerven gestattete ihm nicht, mit Teilnahme oder Gelassenheit Christians eingehende Mitteilungen über seine wechselnden Krankheitserscheinungen anzuhören, und seiner Mutter oder Schwester gegenüber nannte er sie mit Unwillen »die albernen Ergebnisse einer widerwärtigen Selbstbeobachtung«.","Thomas's strenuous activity and the state of his nerves did not allow him to listen with sympathy or calmly to Christian's detailed reports about his changing symptoms of illness, and to his mother or sister he resentfully called them ""the silly results of a repugnant introspection.""",The stress of business and the state of his own nerves made it impossible for Tom to listen with sympathy or even composure to Christian’s detailed descriptions of the ever-changing symptoms of his illness; and in talking to his mother or sister he would angrily call it “the silly upshot of a case of disgusting self-absorption.”,"Tom's irritable activity and the condition of his nerves would not let him listen sympathetically or even patiently to Christian's detailed accounts of his increasing symptoms.

"Dann, nachdem die Verkäufe, die nach des Direktors Verschwinden notwendig wurden, beendet waren, begann man in der Stadt Hugo Weinschenk zu vergessen. Aber die Damen Buddenbrook aus der Breiten Straße bekannten nun Donnerstags an der Familientafel: sofort, beim ersten Anblicke dieses Mannes hätten sie es ihm an den Augen angesehen, daß mit ihm nicht alles in Ordnung sei, daß sein Charakter voller Makel sein müsse, und daß es kein gutes Ende mit ihm nehmen werde. Rücksichten, die nicht lieber außer acht gelassen zu haben sie jetzt bedauerten, hätten sie veranlaßt, über diese traurige Erkenntnis Stillschweigen zu beobachten.","Then, after the sales necessitated by the director's disappearance were completed, the town began to forget Hugo Weinschenk. But the Buddenbrook ladies from Breite Strasse now confessed on Thursdays at the family table: Immediately, at first sight of this man, they could see from his eyes that everything was not right with him, that his character must be full of flaws, and that it won't end well for him. Considerations, which they now regretted not having preferred to ignore, would have caused them to observe silence about this sad realization.","And then, once everything had been sold that had to be sold after Hugo Weinschenk’s disappearance, the town began to forget him. But every Thursday, when the family gathered around the table, the Ladies Buddenbrook from Breite Strasse confessed that, from the moment they first saw him, they could tell from the man’s eyes that he was not all he should be, that there were serious flaws in his character, and that he would come to no good end. Their consideration for others—which, as they now observed to their regret, it would have been better to disregard—had led them to keep this unfortunate knowledge to themselves.","The necessary sale followed upon the disappearance of the Director; and when it was over, people in town began gradually to forget about Hugo Weinschenk. But the Misses Buddenbrook, sitting on Thursday at the family table, declared that they had known the first moment, from the man's eyes, that he was not straight, that his conscience was bad, and that there would be trouble in the end. Certain con-siderations, which they wished now they had not regarded, had led them to suppress these painful observations."

"Und die kleine Antonie, achtjährig und zartgebaut, in einem Kleidchen aus ganz leichter changierender Seide, den hübschen Blondkopf ein wenig vom Gesichte des Großvaters abgewandt, blickte aus ihren graublauen Augen angestrengt nachdenkend und ohne etwas zu sehen ins Zimmer hinein, wiederholte noch einmal: »Was ist das«, sprach darauf langsam: »Ich glaube, daß mich Gott«, fügte, während ihr Gesicht sich aufklärte, rasch hinzu: »– geschaffen hat samt allen Kreaturen«, war plötzlich auf glatte Bahn geraten und schnurrte nun, glückstrahlend und unaufhaltsam, den ganzen Artikel daher, getreu nach dem Katechismus, wie er soeben, anno 1835, unter Genehmigung eines hohen und wohlweisen Senates, neu revidiert herausgegeben war. Wenn man im Gange war, dachte sie, war es ein Gefühl, wie wenn man im Winter auf dem kleinen Handschlitten mit den Brüdern den »Jerusalemsberg« hinunterfuhr: es vergingen einem geradezu die Gedanken dabei, und man konnte nicht einhalten, wenn man auch wollte.","And little Antonie, eight years old and delicately built, in a little dress made of very light, iridescent silk, her pretty blond head a little turned away from her grandfather's face, looked out of her grey-blue eyes, thinking hard and seeing nothing into the room, repeated once more: "" What is that,' said slowly: 'I believe that God,' added while her face cleared, quickly added: '- created me, along with all creatures,' had suddenly found a smooth path and was now purring, beaming with happiness and unstoppable, hence the whole article, faithful to the catechism as it had just been published in 1835, with the approval of a high and wise senate. When you were in motion, she thought, it was like driving down the Jerusalem Mountain with your brothers on a little hand sled in winter: your thoughts almost died away and you couldn't stop even if you wanted to .","And little Antonie, a petite eight-year-old in a dress of softly shimmering silk, was thinking hard, her pretty blond head turned slightly toward her grandfather, but her gray-blue eyes directed into the room without seeing anything. She first repeated, “What does this mean,” then slowly said, “I believe that God made me,” and quickly added, her face brightening, “—and all creatures,” and, suddenly finding the track smooth —she was unstoppable now and her face beamed with happiness —she rattled off the whole article, as prescribed by her catechism, newly revised and published under the auspices of an august and wise senate in this year of our Lord, 1835. Once you were moving, she thought, it felt just like racing down “Jerusalem Hill” on the sled with her brothers in winter: every thought vanished from your mind, and you couldn’t stop if you wanted to.","Dainty little eight-year-old Antonie, in her light shot-silk frock, turned her head away from her grandfather and stared aimlessly about the room with her blue-grey eyes, trying hard to remember.

"Tony ging nicht müßig, sie nahm ihre Sache in die Hand.

"Das schwarze Kleid gab ihrer Gestalt eine mädchenhafte Schlankheit, und obgleich sie den Tod des Konsuls, dem sie während der letzten Zeit so herzlich nahegestanden, vielleicht von allen am schmerzlichsten empfand, obgleich sie noch heute bei dem Gedanken an ihn zweimal in bittere Tränen ausgebrochen war, vermochte die Aussicht auf diesen kleinen Familienrat, diese kleine ernsthafte Unterredung, an der sie mit Würde teilzunehmen gedachte, ihre hübschen Wangen zu röten, ihren Blick zu beleben, ihren Bewegungen Freude und Wichtigkeit zu geben … Die Konsulin dagegen, ermattet vom Schrecken, vom Schmerz, von tausend Trauerformalitäten und den Begräbnisfeierlichkeiten, sah leidend aus. Ihr Gesicht, von den schwarzen Spitzen der Haubenbänder umrahmt, erschien noch bleicher dadurch, und ihre hellblauen Augen blickten matt. In ihrem glattgescheitelten, rotblonden Haar aber war noch immer kein einziges weißes Fädchen zu sehen … War auch dies noch die Pariser Tinktur oder schon die Perücke?

The Consul, on the other hand, exhausted with terror, Pain, from a thousand mourning formalities and the funeral ceremonies, looked suffering. Her face, framed by the black lace of the cap ribbons, appeared even paler, and her light blue eyes looked dull.

Her mother, however, did not look well; she was exhausted by grief, apprehension, and the thousand sad formalities of a funeral.

"Ida Jungmann war nicht zu bewegen gewesen, diesen Besuch zu wiederholen; vielmehr hatte sie darauf bestanden, daß, wollten die beiden beieinander sein, Kai lieber Hanno besuchen sollte, und so hatte der kleine Graf denn zum ersten Male mit aufrichtiger Bewunderung, aber doch ohne Scheu das prachtvolle Vaterhaus seines Freundes betreten.

"»Ja, damit habe ich wohl etwas Eindruck gemacht, und der gute Wille ist jedenfalls vorhanden. Ich kann nur dankbar sein, wissen Sie, daß mein Vater, Großvater und Urgroßvater mir die Wege geebnet haben, und daß viel von dem Vertrauen und dem Ansehen, das sie sich in der Stadt erworben haben, ohne weiteres auf mich übertragen wird, denn sonst könnte ich mich gar nicht so regen … Was hat zum Beispiel nach 48 und zu Anfang dieses Jahrzehnts mein Vater nicht alles für die Reformation unseres Postwesens getan! Denken Sie mal, Wenzel, wie er in der Bürgerschaft gemahnt hat, die Hamburger Diligencen mit der Post zu vereinigen, und wie er anno 50 beim Senate, der damals ganz unverantwortlich langsam war, mit immer neuen Anträgen zum Anschluß an den deutsch-österreichischen Postverein getrieben hat … Wenn wir jetzt einen niedrigen Portosatz für Briefe haben und die Kreuzbandsendungen und die Freimarken und Briefkasten und die telegraphischen Verbindungen mit Berlin und Travemünde, er ist nicht der Letzte, dem wir dafür zu danken haben, und wenn er und ein paar andere Leute den Senat nicht immer wieder gedrängt hätten, so wären wir wohl ewig hinter der dänischen und der Thurn- und Taxischen Post zurückgeblieben.

I can only be thankful, you know, that my father, grandfather, and great-grandfather paved the way for me, and that much of the trust and respect they have earned in the city goes straight to me, otherwise I couldn't move so much... For example, after 1948 and at the beginning of this decade, what did my father not do for the reformation of our postal service! Just think, Wenzel, how he warned the city council to combine the Hamburg diligence with the post office, and how he did in the year 50 at the senate, which was irresponsibly slow at the time, with ever new applications for connection to the German-Austrian postal union … If we now have a low postage rate for letters and the Kreuzband mailings and the postage stamps and mailboxes and the telegraphic connections with Berlin and Travemünde, he is not the last person we have to thank for it, and if he and a few other people If we hadn't pressed the Senate again and again, we would probably have stayed behind the Danish and the Thurn- und Taxische Post forever.

Otherwise I couldn’t move a finger. For example, just think of what all my father did after ’48, and on through the beginning of this decade, for the postal system.

If we have lower postal rates these days—and stamps and book rates and mailboxes and a telegraph connection between Berlin and Travemünde—he’s not the last person we have to thank for it, and if he and a few other people had not constantly urged the senate to act, we would have lagged behind the Danish and Thurn and Taxis postal services forever.

The straight, bunchy moustaches, of the same colour as the hair, were more prominent than the small snub nose. lt)5 His eyes were brown and bright, with puffs of flesh beneath them; when he played they looked as though their gaze passed through whatever was in their way and rested on the other side. His face was not striking, but it had at least the stamp of a strong and lively intelligence. His eyelids were usually half drooped, and he had a way of relaxing his lower jaw without opening his mouth, which gave him a flabby, resigned expression like that sometimes seen on the face of a sleeping person."

"Das Schlimme bestand darin, daß folgendes bekannt wurde: Der Schüler Christian Buddenbrook durfte eines Abends mit einem guten Freunde das Stadttheater besuchen, woselbst »Wilhelm Tell« von Schiller gegeben wurde; die Rolle von Tells Knaben Walter jedoch spielte eine junge Dame, eine Demoiselle Meyer-de la Grange, mit der es eine eigne Bewandtnis hatte. Sie pflegte nämlich, war es ihrer Rolle nun angemessen oder nicht, auf der Bühne eine Brillantbrosche zu tragen, die notorisch echt war, denn wie allgemein bekannt, war sie ein Geschenk des jungen Konsuls Peter Döhlmann, Sohn des verstorbenen Holzgroßhändlers Döhlmann in der Ersten Wallstraße vorm Holstentor. Konsul Peter gehörte zu den Herren, die in der Stadt »Suitiers« genannt wurden – wie zum Beispiel auch Justus Kröger –, das heißt seine Lebensführung war ein wenig locker. Er war verheiratet und besaß sogar eine kleine Tochter, befand sich aber seit längerer Zeit mit seiner Gattin in Zwietracht und lebte ganz wie ein Junggeselle. Das Vermögen, das sein Vater ihm hinterlassen hatte, dessen Geschäft er sozusagen fortführte, war ziemlich bedeutend gewesen; aber man sagte sich, daß er dennoch vom Kapitale zehre. Er hielt sich meistens im »Klub« oder im Ratskeller auf, um zu frühstücken, ward jeden Morgen um 4 Uhr irgendwo in den Straßen gesehen und unternahm häufig Geschäftsreisen nach Hamburg. Vor allem jedoch war er ein eifriger Theaterliebhaber, versäumte keine Vorstellung und nahm persönliches Interesse an dem ausübenden Personal. Demoiselle Meyer-de la Grange war die letzte der jungen Künstlerinnen, die er in den vergangenen Jahren mit Brillanten ausgezeichnet hatte …","The bad thing was that the following became known: one evening the schoolboy Christian Buddenbrook was allowed to visit the municipal theater with a good friend, where Schiller's Wilhelm Tell was being performed; but the role of Tell's boy Walter was played by a young lady, a Demoiselle Meyer-de la Grange, with whom something special happened. Whether it was appropriate for her role or not, she used to wear a diamond brooch on stage, which was notoriously genuine because, as is well known, it was a gift from the young Consul Peter Döhlmann, son of the late wood wholesaler Döhlmann in Erste Wallstrasse in front of the Holstentor. Consul Peter was one of those gentlemen who were called ""suitiers"" in town - like Justus Kröger, for example - which means that his lifestyle was a little lax. He was married and even had a young daughter, but had been at odds with his wife for a long time and lived quite like a bachelor. The fortune his father had left him, whose business he was carrying on, so to speak, had been quite substantial; but one said to oneself that he still lived off the capital. He usually stayed in the ""Klub"" or in the Ratskeller to have breakfast, was seen somewhere in the streets at 4 o'clock every morning, and often went on business trips to Hamburg. Above all, however, he was an avid theater lover, never missed a performance and took a personal interest in the performing staff. Demoiselle Meyer-de la Grange was the last of the young artists he had decorated with diamonds in recent years...","One evening Christian Buddenbrook and one of his good friends were permitted to attend a performance of Schiller’s William Tell at the municipal theater.

Whether it was appropriate to her role or not, she was in the habit of wearing a diamond brooch on stage—the jewels were notoriously genuine and generally known to have been the gift of Consul Peter Döhlmann, the son of Döhlmann the lumber merchant on Erste Wall Strasse, just outside the Holsten Gate. Consul Peter was one of the gentlemen known around town as suitiers—so, too, for example, was Justus Kröger—which implied that his style of life was rather loose. He was married and even had a little daughter, but for some time now he had been separated from his wife and lived quite the bachelor life. The fortune his father had left him, apart from the business which he still ran after a fashion, had been quite considerable. But it was rumored that he was already living off the capital. He spent most of his time and took his breakfast at the Club or the Rathskeller, but he could often be seen wandering the streets at four in the morning and took frequent business trips to Hamburg. But, above all, he was such a passionate lover of the theater that he never missed a performance and took a personal interest in the players. Demoiselle Meyer–de la Grange was the latest in this year’s series of actresses whom he had favored with diamonds.","79 The worst, when it became known, was as follows: Young Christian Buddenbrook had leave one evening to go to the theatre in company with a friend. The performance was Schiller's Wilhelm Tell; and the role of Tell's son Walter was played by a young lady, a certain Mademoiselle Meyer-de-la-Grange. Christian's worst, then, had to do with this young person. She wore when on the stage, whether it suited her part or not, a diamond brooch, which was notoriously genu-ine; for, as everybody knew, it was the gift of young Consul Dohlmann--Peter Dbhlmann, son of the deceased wholesale dealer in Wall Street outside Holsten Gate. Consul Peter, like Justus Kr�ger, belonged to the group of young men whom the town called ""fast. "" His way of life, that is to say, was rather loose! He had married, and had one child, a little daughter; but he had long ago quarrelled with his wife, and he led the life of a bachelor. His father had left him a considerable inheritance, and he carried on the business, after a fashion; but people said he was already living on his capital. He lived mostly at the Club or the Rathskeller, was often to be met somewhere in the street at four o'clock in the morning; and made frequent business trips to Hamburg. Above all, he was a zealous patron of the drama, and took a strong personal interest in the caste. Mademoiselle Meyer-de-la- Grange was the latest of a line of young ladies whom he had, in the past, distinguished by a gift of diamonds."

Master tailor Stuht from Glockengiesserstrasse appeared, wearing a black coat over a woolen shirt. This or that neighbor, florist Iwersen congratulated.

Herr Stuht, the master tailor from Glockengiesser Strasse, appeared in a black coat that he had pulled on over his woolen shirt. There were various neighbors as well—Iwersen, the owner of the flower shop, offered his congratulations. An old mailman, a true eccentric with a white beard, rings in both ears, and rheumy eyes—whom on his good days the senator made a point of greeting as Herr Postmaster—stuck his head in the door and called, “That ain’t why I come by, Senator Buddenbrook, ’tain’t it at all. I know people’re sayin’ ev’rybody what comes by gets a little sumpin’, but that ain’t why I’m here.” All the same, he gratefully accepted the coin. There was no end to it.

"Oftmals, wenn die trüben Stunden kamen, fragte sich Thomas Buddenbrook, was er eigentlich noch sei, was ihn eigentlich noch berechtige, sich auch nur ein wenig höher einzuschätzen als irgendeiner seiner einfach veranlagten, biderben und kleinbürgerlich beschränkten Mitbürger. Die phantasievolle Schwungkraft, der muntere Idealismus seiner Jugend war dahin. Im Spiele zu arbeiten und mit der Arbeit zu spielen, mit einem halb ernst, halb spaßhaft gemeinten Ehrgeiz nach Zielen zu streben, denen man nur einen Gleichniswert zuerkennt – zu solchen heiter-skeptischen Kompromissen und geistreichen Halbheiten gehört viel Frische, Humor und guter Mut; aber Thomas Buddenbrook fühlte sich unaussprechlich müde und verdrossen.","Often, when the gloomy hours came, Thomas Buddenbrook asked himself what he actually still was, what actually still entitled him to rate himself just a little higher than any of his fellow citizens who were simply inclined, staid and narrow-minded, narrow-minded.

The imaginative élan and cheerful idealism of youth were gone. To play at work, to work at play, to strive, to direct one’s half-serious, half-whimsical ambition toward goals to which one ascribes only symbolic value—that requires a great deal of vigor, humor, and a breezy kind of courage for debonair, skeptical compromises and ingenious half-measures; but Thomas Buddenbrook felt indescribably weary and listless.","OFTEN, in an hour of depression, Thomas Buddenbrouk asked himself what he was, or what there was about him to make him think even a little better of himself than he did of his honest, limited, provincial fellow-burghers. The imaginative grasp, the brave idealism of his youth was gone. To work at his play, to play at his work, to bend an ambition that was half-earnest, half-whimsical, toward the accomplishment of aims that even to himself possessed but a symbolic value--for such blithe scepticism and such an enlightened spirit of compromise, a great deal of vitality is necessary, as well as a sense of humour.

"Mit seinem braunen Haar, das er jetzt seitwärts gescheitelt und schräg von seiner weißen Stirn zurückgebürstet trug, das aber dennoch danach strebte, sich in weichen Locken tief über die Schläfen zu schmiegen, mit seinen langen, braunen Wimpern und seinen goldbraunen Augen stach Johann Buddenbrook auf dem Schulhof und auf der Straße trotz seines Kopenhagener Matrosenanzuges stets ein wenig fremdartig unter den hellblonden und stahlblauäugigen, skandinavischen Typen seiner Kameraden hervor. Er war in letzter Zeit ziemlich stark gewachsen, aber seine Beine in den schwarzen Strümpfen und seine Arme in den dunkelblauen, bauschigen und gesteppten Ärmeln waren schmal und weich wie die eines Mädchens, und noch immer lagen, wie bei seiner Mutter, die bläulichen Schatten in den Winkeln seiner Augen, – dieser Augen, die, besonders wenn sie seitwärts gerichtet waren, mit einem so zagen und ablehnenden Ausdruck dareinblickten, während sein Mund sich noch immer auf jene wehmütige Art geschlossen hielt, oder während Hanno nachdenklich die Zungenspitze an einem Zahne scheuerte, dem er mißtraute, mit leichtverzerrten Lippen und einer Miene, als fröre ihn …","With his brown hair, which he now parted sideways and brushed back from his white forehead at an angle, but which nevertheless strived to nestle down in soft curls over his temples, with his long brown eyelashes and his golden brown eyes, Johann Buddenbrook stood out in the schoolyard and on the street, despite his Copenhagen sailor suit, he always looked a little strange among the light-blond and steel-blue-eyed Scandinavian types of his comrades. He had grown quite a bit lately, but his legs in the black stockings and his arms in the dark blue, puffy and quilted sleeves were narrow and soft like a girl's, and still, like his mother's, the bluish shades lay in him the corners of his eyes—those eyes which, especially when turned sideways, gazed into them with such a timid and dismissive expression, while his mouth was still kept shut in that wistful way, or while Hanno thoughtfully rubbed the tip of his tongue on a tooth , whom he distrusted, with slightly twisted lips and an expression as if he were cold...","Out on the playground or even just on the street, Johann Buddenbrook always stuck out among his towheaded, steely-blue-eyed, Scandinavian-looking classmates—despite his Danish sailor outfit.

He had grown quite a bit of late, but his black-stockinged legs and his arms—hidden under his dark-blue, full, quilted sleeves—were as small and weak as a girl’s. And like his mother, he still had those bluish shadows in the corners of his eyes—eyes that looked out on the world hesitantly and defensively, especially when he glanced off to one side. He held his mouth shut tight in that melancholy way of his, slightly distorting his lips while he pensively rubbed the tip of his tongue against a tooth—he still didn’t trust those teeth—and from the expression on his face it looked as if he felt chilled.","Hanno had grown sturdier in the past year; but, despite his blue sailor suit, he still looked a little strange in the play-ground of the school, by contrast with the blond Scandina-vian type that predominated there. He now wore his brnwn hair parted on the side and brushed away from his white forehead. But it still inclined to fall in soft ringlets over the temples; and his eyes were as golden-brown as ever, and as veiled with their brown lashes. His legs, in long black stockings, and his arms, in the loose quilted blue sleeves of his suit, were small and soft like a girl's, and he had, like his mother, the blue shadows under his eyes. And still, in those eyes, especially when they gave a side glance, as they often did, there was that timid and defensive look; while the mouth closed with the old, woebegone expression which he had had even as a baby, or went slightly crooked when he explored the recesses of his mouth for a defective tooth. And there would come upon his face when he did this a look as if he were cold."

"Gleich morgens um acht Uhr, sobald er das Bett verlassen hatte, über die Wendeltreppe hinter der kleinen Pforte ins Souterrain hinabgestiegen war, ein Bad genommen und seinen Schlafrock wieder angelegt hatte, begann Konsul Buddenbrook sich mit öffentlichen Dingen zu beschäftigen. Dann nämlich erschien, mit seinen roten Händen und seinem intelligenten Gesicht, mit einem Topfe warmen Wassers, den er sich aus der Küche geholt, und den übrigen Utensilien, Herr Wenzel, Barbier und Mitglied der Bürgerschaft, in der Badestube, und während der Konsul sich, zurückgebeugten Hauptes, in einem großen Lehnstuhle niederließ und Herr Wenzel Schaum zu schlagen begann, entspann sich fast immer ein Gespräch, das, mit Nachtruhe und Witterung beginnend, alsbald zu Ereignissen in der großen Welt überging, sich hierauf mit intim städtischen Angelegenheiten beschäftigte und mit ganz eng geschäftlichen und familiären Gegenständen zu schließen pflegte … Dies alles zog die Prozedur sehr in die Länge, denn immer, wenn der Konsul sprach, mußte Herr Wenzel das Messer von seinem Gesicht entfernen.","At eight o'clock in the morning, as soon as he got out of bed, descended the spiral staircase behind the small gate to the basement, had a bath and put on his dressing gown again, Consul Buddenbrook began to occupy himself with public affairs. Then, with his red hands and his intelligent face, Herr Wenzel, barber and member of the city council, appeared in the bathroom with a pot of warm water he had fetched from the kitchen and the other utensils, while the Consul himself , head bowed back, sat down in a large armchair and Herr Wenzel began to froth, a conversation almost always ensued, which, beginning with a night’s rest and the weather, soon went on to events in the big world, then dealt with intimate city affairs and with very closely related to business and family matters... All of this made the procedure very lengthy, because whenever the consul spoke, Herr Wenzel had to remove the knife from his face.","WHEN CONSUL BUDDENBROOK left his bed each morning, he would descend to the ground floor via the spiral staircase hidden behind the little door, take his bath, and put his dressing gown back on—and by eight o’clock he was already engaged in civic affairs. Because at precisely that hour Herr Wenzel, the barber and member of the town council, would appear in his bathroom, a man with an intelligent face and red hands, in which he carried the tools of his trade and a basin of warm water fetched from the kitchen. The consul would sit down in a large armchair and lay his head back, Herr Wenzel would begin to lather his soap—and then there almost always ensued a conversation that started with the weather and how each had slept, but soon turned to events in the great, wide world, moved on to the town’s domestic affairs, and generally concluded with very personal matters of business and family. All of which tended to prolong the process, because, whenever the consul spoke, Herr Wenzel would have to lift the razor from his face.","IN the morning at eight o'clock Consul Buddenbrook, so soon as he had left his bed, stolen through the little door and down the winding stair into the bathroom, taken a bath, and put on his night-shirt again--Consul 3uddenbrook, we say, began to busy himself with public affairs. For then Herr Wenzel, barber and member of the Assembly, appeared, with his in-telligent face and his red hands, his razors and other tools, and the basin of warm water which he had fetched from the kitchen; and the Consul sat in a reclining-chair and leaned his head back, and Herr Wenzel began to make a lather; and there ensued almost always a conversation that began with the weather and how you had slept the night beforr, wpnt on to politics and the great world, thence to domestic1 aflaiis in the city itself, and closed in an intimate and familiar key on business and family matters.

And above it all, written in the tall Gothic script of a hand familiar to his descendants, was the motto: “My son, show zeal for each day’s affairs of business, but only for such that make for a peaceful night’s sleep.”","In a large, heavy frame of carved nut-wood were the portraits of the four owners of the firm, under glass. There was the founder, Johann Buddenbrook, taken from an old oil painting--a tall, grave old gentleman, with his lips firmly closed, looking severe and determined above his lace jabot. There was the broad and jovial countenance of Johann Bud-denbrrmk, the friend of Jean Jacques Hoffstede. There was Consul Johann Buddenbrook, in a stiff choker collar, with his wide, wrinkled mouth and large aquiline nose, his eyes full of religious fervour. And finally there was Thomas Buddenbrook himself, as a somewhat younger man. The four portraits were divided by conventionalized blades of wheat, heavily gilded, and beneath, likewise in figures of brilliant gilt, the dates 1768-1868. Above the whole, in the tall, Gothic hand of him who had left it to his descendants, was the quotation: ""My son, attend with zeal, to thy busi-ness by day; but do none that hinders thee from thy sleep at night."""
"Der kleine Johann war gehalten, sich von der sterblichen Hülle seiner Großmutter zu verabschieden; sein Vater ordnete dies an, und er ließ keinen Laut des Widerspruches vernehmen, obgleich er sich fürchtete. Am Tage nach dem schweren Todeskampfe der Konsulin hatte der Senator, bei Tische und, wie es schien, geflissentlich in Gegenwart seines Sohnes, gegen seine Gattin mit ein paar harten Worten das Betragen Onkel Christians verurteilt, der, als es der Kranken am schlimmsten ging, davongeschlichen und zu Bette gegangen war. »Das sind die Nerven, Thomas«, hatte Gerda geantwortet; aber mit einem Blick auf Hanno, der dem Kinde keineswegs entgangen war, hatte er ihr in fast strengem Tone zurückgegeben, daß hier kein Wort der Entschuldigung am Platze sei. Die selige Mutter habe so sehr gelitten, daß man sich hätte schämen müssen, allzu schmerzlos dabei zu sitzen, und sich nicht feige dem bißchen Leiden entziehen, das der Anblick ihrer Kämpfe in einem hervorgerufen hätte. Hieraus hatte Hanno geschlossen, daß er es nicht wagen dürfe, gegen den Besuch am offenen Sarge etwas einzuwenden.","Little Johann was obliged to say goodbye to his grandmother's mortal shell; his father ordered this, and he made not a sound of protest, though he was afraid. The day after the consul's severe agony, the senator, at the table and, as it seemed, studiously in the presence of his son, condemned his wife with a few harsh words for the behavior of uncle Christian, who, when the patient was at its worst, slipped away and went to bed. ""It's the nerves, Thomas,"" Gerda had answered; but with a look at Hanno, which the child had by no means escaped, he replied in an almost stern tone that no word of apology was appropriate here. The blessed mother had suffered so much that one should have been ashamed to sit there too painlessly, and not cowardly withdraw from the little suffering that the sight of her struggles would have caused in one. From this Hanno had concluded that he dare not object to the visit to the open coffin.","IT WAS LITTLE JOHANN’S DUTY to say goodbye to his grandmother’s mortal remains —his father had ordered him to do it. He was afraid, but he hadn’t objected, hadn’t said a word, not a peep. The day after old Madame Buddenbrook had wrestled with death, the senator had been sitting at the table with his wife, and he had made some harsh comments—quite deliberately in the presence of his son, it seemed—about the way Uncle Christian had behaved, slinking away to bed just when his mother’s suffering had been at its worst. “Those were just nerves, Thomas,” Gerda had replied; but, with a glance at Hanno, which the boy did not fail to notice, he had responded in an almost stern voice that there could be no excuse for such behavior. His dear mother had suffered so much that it was almost shameful to sit there and feel none of her pain, let alone to be so cowardly as to avoid the comparatively minor distress that came from having to watch her struggles. Hanno concluded from this that he did not dare object to paying his respects at the open casket.","LITTLE Johann was to go to take his farewell of his grand-mother's mortal remains. His father so arranged it, and, though Hanno was afraid, he made not a syllable of objection. At table, the day after the Frau Consul's dying struggle, the Senator, in his son's presence and apparently with design, had commented harshly upon the conduct of Uncle Christian, who had slipped away and gone to bed when the patient's suffering was at its height. ""That was his nerves, Thomas,"" Gerda had answered. But with a glance at Harmi), which had not escaped the child, the Senator had severely retorted that an excuse was not in place. The agony of their departed mother had been so sore that one had felt ashamed even to be sitting there free from pain--not to mention entertaining the cowardly thought of trying to escape any suffering of mind called up by the sight. From which, Hanno had gathered that it would not be safe to object to the visit to the open coffin."

"»Schließlich soll es ja doch sein«, sagte sie wieder, indem sie aufatmend den kalten Umschlag entgegennahm, »denn die Hauptsache ist und bleibt, daß ich wieder unter die Haube komme und hier nicht länger als geschiedene Frau herumliege … Ach, Ida, ich muß soviel zurückdenken in diesen Tagen, an damals, als Grünlich zuerst erschien, und an die Auftritte, die er mir machte – skandalös, Ida! – und dann Travemünde, Schwarzkopfs …«, sagte sie langsam, und ihre Augen ruhten eine Weile träumerisch auf der gestopften Stelle von Erikas Strumpf … »und dann die Verlobung und Eimsbüttel, und unser Haus – es war vornehm, Ida; wenn ich an meine Schlafröcke denke … So werde ich es nicht wieder haben, mit Permaneder; das Leben macht einen immer bescheidener, weißt du – und Doktor Klaaßen, und das Kind, und Bankier Kesselmeyer … und dann das Ende – es war entsetzlich, du machst dir keinen Begriff, und wenn man so grauenhafte Erfahrungen gemacht hat im Leben … Aber Permaneder wird sich nicht auf schmutzige Sachen einlassen; – das ist das letzte, was ich ihm zutraue, und geschäftlich können wir uns gut auf ihn verlassen, denn ich glaube wirklich, daß er mit Noppe bei der Niederpaurschen Brauerei ziemlich viel verdient.

Because the point is, has always been, that I need to marry again and stop dawdling around here as a divorced woman. Oh, Ida, I’ve been thinking about the past so much of late, back when Grünlich first appeared and the scenes he made—it was scandalous, Ida. And Travemünde, too, the Schwarzkopfs,” she said slowly, and her eyes rested dreamily for a while on the spot where Erika’s stocking had been darned. “And then the engagement and our house in Eimsbüttel—it was elegant, Ida. When I think of my dressing gowns. I’ll never have it like that again, not with Permaneder—but life has a way of making us more modest, you know. And then Dr. Klaassen, and my baby, and Kesselmeyer the banker. And then came the end —it was horrible, you have no idea how horrible. And once you’ve had such ghastly experiences in life … But Permaneder won’t get involved in nasty things like that. It’s the last thing I would expect of him, and we can rely on him when it comes to business, too. Because I really believe that he and Noppe have done very well for themselves with the Niederpaurs’ brewery. And once I am his wife, Ida, you’ll see. I’ll make sure that he’s more ambitious, puts out some effort and gets ahead, and is a credit to me and to all of us— that is his duty, after all, if he’s going to marry a Buddenbrook.”","do wet the compress again."" ""But it must be so, in the end,"" she went on again, drawing a long breath as the compress went on; ""for the main point is and remains that I must get married again, and not stick about here any longer as a divorced woman. Ah, Ida, I think so much about the past these days: about the time when Criinlich first appeared, and the scenes he made me--scan-dalous, Ida!--and then about Travemiinde and the Schwarz-kopfs-- "" She spoke slowly, and her eyes rested for a while dreamily on a darn in Erica's stocking. "" And then the be-trothal, and Eimsbiittel, and our house. It was quite elegant, Ida.

It was frightful; you can't imagine how frightful it was. And when you have had such dreadful experiences in life--But Permaneder would never go in for anything filthy like that. That is the last thing in the world I should expect of him, and we can rely on him too in a business way, for I really think he makes a good deal with Nappe at the Niederpaur brewery. And when I am his wife, you'll see, Ida, I will take care that he has ambition and gels ahead and makes an effort and is a credit to me and all of us. That, at least, he takes upon himself when he marries a Buddenbrook!"""
"»Es ist gut«, sagte er gleich darauf zu dem Lehrling, und der junge Mensch verschwand.","""It's good,"" he said immediately afterwards to the apprentice, and the young man disappeared.","Then he turned to the apprentice and said, “That will do.” And the young fellow disappeared.","He was plainly preoccupied with the contents of the message; but, even as he read it, he asked in the easiest tone: ""Well, how is business, Herr Permaneder?--That will do,"" he said immediately to the apprentice, who disappeared."
"Was fürchtete er? Wieder hatten die Leute Herrn von Throta in das Haus eintreten sehen, und mit ihren Augen gleichsam, so, wie es sich ihnen darstellte, sah er dies Bild: sich selbst, den alternden, abgenutzten und übellaunigen Mann unten im Kontor am Fenster sitzen, während droben seine schöne Frau mit ihrem Galan musizierte und nicht nur musizierte … Ja, so erschienen ihnen die Dinge, er wußte es. Und dennoch wußte er auch, daß das Wort »Galan« für Herrn von Throta eigentlich sehr wenig bezeichnend war. Ach, er wäre beinahe glücklich gewesen, wenn er ihn so hätte nennen und auffassen dürfen, ihn als einen windigen, unwissenden und ordinären Jungen hätte verstehen und verachten können, der seine normale Portion von Übermut in ein wenig Kunst ausströmen läßt und damit Frauenherzen gewinnt. Er ließ nichts unversucht, ihn zu einer solchen Figur zu stempeln. Er rief einzig und allein zu diesem Behufe die Instinkte seiner Väter in sich wach: das ablehnende Mißtrauen des seßhaften und sparsamen Kaufmannes gegenüber der abenteuerlustigen, leichtfertigen und geschäftlich unsicheren Kriegerkaste. In Gedanken sowohl wie in Gesprächen nannte er Herrn von Throta beständig mit geringschätziger Betonung »der Leutnant«; und dabei fühlte er allzu gut, daß dieser Titel nach allen am schlechtesten geeignet war, das Wesen dieses jungen Mannes auszudrücken …","What did he fear? Again the people had seen Herr von Throta enter the house, and with their eyes, as it were, as it appeared to them, he saw this picture: himself, the aging, worn-out, and ill-tempered man downstairs in the office, sitting by the window while upstairs his beautiful wife was making music with her gallant and not just making music... Yes, that's how things seemed to them, he knew it. And yet he also knew that the word ""gallant"" meant very little for Herr von Throta. Oh, he would almost have been happy if he could have called him that and understood him and despised him as a wacky, ignorant and vulgar boy who pours out his normal dose of high spirits in a little art and wins women's hearts with it. He left no stone unturned to stamp him as such a figure. For this purpose alone he evoked in himself the instincts of his fathers: the dismissive distrust of the sedentary and thrifty merchant towards the adventurous, frivolous and commercially insecure warrior caste. In his thoughts as well as in conversation he constantly called Herr von Throta ""the lieutenant"" with a contemptuous emphasis; and at the same time he felt too well that this title was, after all, the worst possible way of expressing the nature of this young man...","What was he afraid of? People had seen Herr von Throta enter his house again, and with their eyes, so to speak, he saw the scene they pictured to themselves: he was sitting downstairs by the window in his office, an aging, worn-out, peevish man, and upstairs his beautiful wife was making music with her lover—and not just music. Yes, that’s how it looked to them, he knew it. And nevertheless he knew that “beau” was not really the word to describe Herr von Throta. Oh, he would almost have been happy if he could have called him that, thought of him as that, if he had been able to despise him as a shallow, empty-headed, and vulgar young man who was working off a normal dose of youthful energy with a little music in order to win ladies’ hearts. He made every conceivable attempt to transform him into such a creature. For that sole purpose, he tried to awaken within himself his forefathers’ old prejudices: the established and frugal merchant’s intransigent mistrust of the frivolous, adventurous, and socially unreliable military caste. In his thoughts, even in conversation, he made a patronizing point of calling Herr von Throta “the lieutenant”; and yet he knew only too well that this was the least applicable term for describing the young man’s character.","What was it that he feared? Once more people had seen Herr von Throta enter his house. And with their eyes he beheld the picture just as they saw it: Below, an aging man, worn out and crotchety, sat at his window in the office; above, his beautiful wife made music with her lover. And not that alone. Yes, that was the way the thing looked to them. He knew it. He was aware, too, that the word ""lover"" was not really descriptive of Herr von Throta. It would have 249 been almost a relief if it were. If he could have understood and despised him as an empty-headed, ordinary youth who worked off his average endowment of high spirits in a little music, and thus beguiled the feminine heart! He tried to think of him like that. He tried to summon up thn instincts of his father to meet the case: the instincts of the thrifty mer-chant against the frivolous, adventurous, unreliable military cast?. He called Herr von Thrnla ""the lieutenant,"" and tried to think of him as that; but in his heart he was conscious that the name was inappropriate."
"Während man sich setzte und im Verlaufe der ersten darauf folgenden Minuten sprachen abwechselnd der Konsul und der Makler. Herr Gosch bat mit abstoßend falscher Demut, hinter der allen sichtbar die Tücke lauerte, gütigst die Störung zu entschuldigen, doch hege Herr Konsul Hagenström den Wunsch, einen Rundgang durch die Räumlichkeiten des Hauses zu tun, da er eventuell als Käufer darauf reflektiere … Und dann wiederholte der Konsul mit einer Stimme, die Frau Permaneder wiederum an belegte Zitronensemmeln gemahnte, dasselbe noch einmal in anderen Worten. Ja, in der Tat, der Gedanke sei ihm gekommen, und er sei schnell zum Wunsche geworden, den er sich und den Seinen erfüllen zu können hoffe, gesetzt, daß nicht Herr Gosch ein gar zu gutes Geschäft dabei zu machen beabsichtige, ha, ha!… nun, er zweifle nicht, daß sich die Angelegenheit zur allseitigen Zufriedenheit werde ordnen lassen.","As they were seated, and for the first few minutes that followed, the consul and the agent spoke in turn. Mr. Gosch kindly apologized for the disturbance with repulsively false humility, behind which everyone could see the peril lurking, but Mr. Consul Hagenström cherished the desire to take a tour of the premises of the house, as he might reflect on it as a buyer ... And then the Consul repeated in a voice that reminded Frau Permaneder of lemon sandwiches, the same thing again in different words. Yes, indeed, the thought had occurred to him, and it quickly became a wish that he hoped to be able to fulfill for himself and his family, assuming that Herr Gosch didn't intend to make too good a deal out of it, ha, ha !... well, he has no doubt that the matter will be settled to everyone's satisfaction.","They sat there for a few minutes, during which the consul and the broker spoke by turns. With a show of appalling false humility and malicious cunning that deceived no one, Herr Gosch kindly begged them to forgive the inconvenience, but Consul Hagenström had expressed a wish to tour the premises with a view to eventual purchase of the house. And then the consul repeated the same thing in different words, in a voice that once again reminded Frau Permaneder of slathered lemon buns. Yes, indeed, once the idea had occurred to him, it had ripened quickly to a wish that he hoped he might be able to realize for himself and his family, provided, of course, that Herr Gosch did not intend to make all too great a profit from the sale—ha ha. Well, he did not doubt that the matter could be settled to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.","They all sat down, and the Consul and the broker talked by turns for the next few minutes. Herr Gosch's voice was offensively obsequious as he begged them to pardon the in-trusion on their privacy--you could hear a malign under-current in it none the less--but Herr Consul Hagenstrbm was anxious to go through the house with a view to possible pur-chase. And the Consul, in a voice that again called up visions of lemon-bun and goose-liver, said the same thing in different words. Yes, in fact, this was the idea he had in mind and hoped to be able to carry out--provided the broker did not try to drive too hard a bargain with him, ha, ha! He did not doubt but the matter could be settled to the satisfaction of everybody concerned."

"Hanno Buddenbrook schloß seine Bibel und reckte sich zitternd und mit nervösem Gähnen; als er aber die Arme senkte und die Glieder abspannte, mußte er eilig und mühsam aufatmen, um sein Herz, das einen Augenblick schwach und wankend den Dienst versagte, ein wenig in Takt zu bringen. Jetzt kam das Lateinische … Er warf einen hilfesuchenden Seitenblick zu Kai hinüber, der das Ende der Stunde gar nicht bemerkt zu haben schien und immer noch in Versunkenheit seiner Privatlektüre oblag, zog den in marmorierte Pappe gebundenen Ovid aus seiner Mappe und schlug die Verse auf, die für heute auswendig zu lernen waren … Nein, es gab keine Hoffnung, diese schwarzen Zeilen, die sich, mit Bleistiftzeichen versehen, schnurgerade und zu fünfen numeriert aneinanderreihten und ihn so hoffnungslos dunkel und unbekannt anstarrten, sich jetzt noch ein wenig vertraut zu machen. Er verstand kaum ihren Sinn, geschweige denn hätte er eine einzige davon aus dem Kopfe hersagen können. Und von denjenigen, die sich daran schlossen und die für heute zu präparieren waren, enträtselte er nicht ein Sätzchen.","Hanno Buddenbrook closed his Bible and stretched, trembling and yawning nervously; but when he lowered his arms and tensed his limbs, he had to breathe quickly and laboriously in order to get his heart, which for a moment weak and faltering, stopped working, a little. Now came the Latin ... He threw a sideways glance at Kai for help, who seemed not to have noticed the end of the lesson and was still absorbed in his private reading, pulled the Ovid bound in marbled cardboard out of his portfolio and opened the verses, that were to be memorized for today... No, there was no hope of familiarizing oneself a little now with those black lines, lined up in pencil, dead straight and numbered five, staring at him so hopelessly dark and unfamiliar. He could scarcely understand their meaning, let alone recite one of them off the top of his head. And of those who followed suit and who had to be prepared for today, he did not unravel a single sentence.","Hanno Buddenbrook closed his Bible, yawned nervously, and stretched till his muscles twitched. As he let his arms fall and relax, he automatically took a quick, labored breath to steady the beat of his heart, which had wavered and stopped for a second. Now came Latin. He threw an imploring look Kai’s way, but Kai was still immersed in reading his book and apparently had not even noticed that class was over. Hanno pulled his Ovid from his satchel, a paperbound book with a marbled cover, and opened it to the verses that were to be memorized for today. No, it was hopeless—a long, regular column of black lines, every fifth one numbered, and with little pencil marks scribbled everywhere, and the lines stared back at him, so obscure and unfamiliar that it was useless to try to learn a few of them. He could barely make out what they meant, let alone recite even a single one by heart. And he could not decipher one line of the passage that followed, which they were supposed to have translated for today.","Hanno Buddenbrook closed his Bible and stretched himself, yawning. It was a nervous yawn; and as he dropped his arms and relaxed his limbs he had to take a long, deep breath to bring his heart back to a steady pulsation, for it weakly refused its office for a second. Latin came next. He cast a beseeching glance at Kai, who still sat there reading and seemed not to have remarked the end of the lesson. Then he drew out his Ovid, in stitched covers of marbled paper, and opened it at the lines that were to have been learned by heart for to-day. No, it was no use now trying to memorize any of it: the regular lines, full of pencil marks, numbered by fives all the way down the page, looked hopelessly un-familiar. He barely understood the sense of them, let alone trying to say a single one of them by heart. And of those in to-day's preparation he had not puzzled out even the first sentence."
"Frau Stuht aus der Glockengießerstraße hatte wieder einmal Gelegenheit, in den ersten Kreisen zu verkehren, indem sie Mamsell Jungmann und die Schneiderin am Hochzeitstage bei Tonys Toilette unterstützte. Sie hatte, strafe sie Gott, niemals eine schönere Braut gesehen, lag, so dick sie war, auf den Knien und befestigte mit bewundernd erhobenen Augen die kleinen Myrtenzweiglein auf der weißen moirée antique … Dies geschah im Frühstückszimmer. Herr Grünlich wartete in langschößigem Frack und seidener Weste vor der Tür.

Herr Drägemüller war ein untersetzter Mann mit rundgeschnittenem Vollbart und einer braunen, glatten, billigen Perücke, die im Nacken verräterisch abstand. Er besaß zwei Perücken, eine mit längerem und eine mit kürzerem Haar; hatte er sich den Bart scheren lassen, so setzte er die kürzere auf … Auch sonst war er ein Mann von einigen drolligen Eigentümlichkeiten. Statt »der Bleistift« sagte er »die Blei«. Außerdem verbreitete er einen ölig-spirituösen Geruch wo er ging und stand, und einige sagten, er tränke Petroleum. Seine schönsten Stunden kamen, wenn er vertretungsweise einmal in einem anderen Fache als im Zeichnen unterrichten durfte. Dann hielt er Vorträge über Bismarcks Politik, die er mit eindringlichen, spiralförmigen Bogenbewegungen von der Nase zur Schulter begleitete, und sprach mit Haß und Furcht von der Sozialdemokratie … »Wir müssen zusammenhalten!« pflegte er zu schlechten Schülern zu sagen, indem er sie am Arme packte. »Die Sozialdemokratie steht vor der Tür!« Er hatte etwas krampfhaft Geschäftiges an sich. Er setzte sich neben einen, verbreitete einen heftigen Spiritusgeruch, schlug einem mit seinem Siegelring vor die Stirn, stieß einzelne Wörter hervor, wie »Perspektive!« »Schlagschatten!« »Die Blei!« »Sozialdemokratie!« »Zusammenhalten!« und enteilte …","The drawing room was wide and light.

He had two wigs, one longer and one shorter; when he had his beard shaved, he put on a shorter one... In other respects, too, he was a man of some droll idiosyncrasies. Instead of ""the pencil"" he said ""the lead."" He also gave off an oily-spirited odor wherever he walked and stood, and some said he imbibed petroleum. His best hours came when he was allowed to teach a subject other than drawing as a substitute. Then he lectured on Bismarck's politics, accompanying them with insistent, spiraling, nose-to-shoulder slurs, and spoke of social democracy with hatred and fear...

He owned two wigs, one with longer, one with shorter hair; whenever he had his beard trimmed, he would don the short-haired one. He was a man with several droll eccentricities. He called lead pencils “leads.” And wherever he went he exuded the oily odor of spirits, and some boys said that he drank kerosene. His finest hours were when he was allowed to substitute in some other class besides drawing. Then he would lecture on Bismarck, and, gesturing in long, emphatic, corkscrew arcs that started at his nose and ended at his shoulder, he would speak of Social Democrats with hate and fear in his voice. “We must stick together,” he would tell his students, grabbing one of them by the arm. “Socialism is at the gates!” There was something stilted and fussy about him. Exuding the strong odor of spirits, he would sit down beside a student, tap him on the forehead with his signet ring, blurt out a few words—like “Perspective!” “Light and shade!” “Use your lead!” “Socialism!” “Stick together!”—and then scurry away.","The for-tunate ones who had come through without marks, had light and easy consciences, and life seemed like play to them as they betook themselves to the large well-lighted room where they might sit and draw under the supervision of Herr Drage-m�ller.

It always delighted him to have an opportunity to take a class in something besides drawing. On such occasions he would lecture on the policy of Bismarck, accompanying himself with impressive spiral gestures from his nose to his shoulder. Social democracy was his bugbear--he spoke of it with fear and loathing. ""We must keep together,"" he used to say to refractory pupils, pinching them on the arm. "" Soual democracy is at the door!""

Light and shade! The lead! Social democracy! Stick together!""--and then dash off again."

I sent my photograph to the lady, and she wrote that she must decline my services, because I was too pretty--there was a grown son in the house. ' You are too pretty,' she wrote! I don't know when I have been so pleased."""
"Man ging oberhalb des Strandes auf dem Steg von paarweise gelegten Brettern der Badeanstalt zu; und als man an den Steinen vorüberkam, wo Morten Schwarzkopf mit seinem Buche saß, nickte Tony ihm aus der Ferne mehrmals mit rascher Kopfbewegung zu. Jemand erkundigte sich: »Wen grüßtest du, Tony?«","One approached the bathing establishment above the beach on the jetty by pairs of planks; and when you passed the stones where Morten Schwarzkopf was sitting with his book, Tony nodded to him several times from afar, with quick movements of his head. Someone asked, ""Who were you greeting, Tony?""","They walked toward the pier, taking the boardwalk laid well above the waterline; and as they passed the boulders where Morten Schwarzkopf was sitting reading, Tony quickly nodded to him several times from a distance. Someone asked, “Who was that you were nodding to?”","They went across the beach on a foot-bridge made of a few boards, and reached the bath-house. As they passed the boulders where Morten Schwarz-kopf sat, Tony nodded to him from a distance, and somebody asked, ""who is that you are bowing to, Tony?"" ""That was young Schwarzkopf,"" Tony answered. "" He walked down here with me."" ""The son of the pilot-captain?"" Julchen asked, and peered across at Morten with her staring black eyes. He on his side watched the gay troop with rather a melancholy air. Tony said in a loud voice: "" What a pity August is not here. It must be stupid on the beach."" CHAPTER VIII AND now began for Tony Buddenbrook a stretch of beautiful summer weeks, briefer, lovelier, than any she had ever spent in Travemiinde. She bloomed as she felt her burden no longer upon her; her gay, pert, careless manner had come back. The Consul looked at her with satisfaction when he came on Sundays with Tom and Christian. On those days they ate at the table-d'hote, sat under the awnings at the pastry-cook's, drinking coffee and listening to the band, and peeped into the roulette-room at the gay folk there, like Justus Kr�ger and Peter D�hlmann. The Consul himself never played. Tony sunned herself, took baths, ate sausages with ginger-nut sauce, and took long walks with Morten. They went out on the high-road to the next village, or along the beach to the ""ocean temple"" on its height, whence a wide view was to be had over land and sea; or to the woods be-hind the Kurhouse, where was a great bell used to call the guests to the table-d'hote. Sometimes they rowed across the Trave to the Prival, to look for amber. Morten made an entertaining companion, though his opinions were often dogmatic, not to say heated. He had a severe and righteous judgment for everything, and he ex-pressed it with finality, blushing all the time. It saddened Tony to hear him call the nobility idiots and wretches and to see the contemptuous if awkward gesture that accompanied the words. She scolded him, but she was proud to have him express so freely in her presence the views and opinions which she knew he concealed from his parents. Once he confided in her: ""I'll tell you something: I've a skeleton in my room at G�ttingen--a whole set of bones, you know, 135 ""How lovely!"" ""When did you come?"" ""What a sweet frock!"" ""Where are you stopping?"" ""At the Schwarzkopf a'?"" ""With the pilot-captain? How original!"" ""How frightfully original."" ""You are stopping in the town?"" asked Consul Fritsche, the owner of the baths. He did not betray that he felt the blow. ""Will you come to our next assembly?"" his wife asked. ""Oh, you are only here for a short time?""--this from another lady. ""Don't you think, darling, the Buddenbrooks rather give themselves airs?"" Frau Hagenstrbm whispered to Frau Sena-tor Mbllendorpf. ""Have you been in yet? "" somebody asked. "" Which of the rest of you hasn't bathed yet, young ladies? Marie?"
»Aber was ist denn so traurig darin?«,"""But what's so sad about it?""",“But what is so sad about it?” “How do I know?,"""But what is there so sad about it?"" ""How do I know?"
"Eines Nachmittags war Hanno drei Viertelstunden vorm Essen, das um vier Uhr stattfand, allein in die erste Etage hinabgestiegen. Er hatte eine Zeitlang am Flügel geübt und hielt sich nun müßig im Wohnzimmer auf. Halb liegend saß er auf der Chaiselongue, nestelte an dem Schifferknoten auf seiner Brust, und indem seine Augen, ohne etwas zu suchen, seitwärts glitten, gewahrte er auf dem zierlichen Nußholzschreibtisch seiner Mutter eine offene Ledermappe – die Mappe mit den Familienpapieren. Er stützte den Ellbogen auf das Rückenpolster und das Kinn in die Hand und betrachtete die Sachen ein Weilchen aus der Ferne. Ohne Zweifel hatte Papa sich heute nach dem zweiten Frühstück damit beschäftigt und sie zu weiterem Gebrauche liegenlassen. Eines stak in der Mappe, lose Blätter, die draußen lagen, waren vorläufig mit einem metallenen Lineal beschwert, das große Schreibheft mit goldnem Schnitt und verschiedenartigem Papier lag offen da.","One afternoon, three quarters of an hour before dinner, which was at four o'clock, Hanno went down to the first floor alone. He had been practicing on the grand piano for a while and was now idle in the living room. He sat half reclining on the chaise longue, fumbling with the sailor's knot on his chest, and as his eyes slid sideways without searching for anything, he saw an open leather folder on his mother's dainty walnut desk - the folder with the family papers. He rested his elbow on the back pad and his chin in his hand and looked at things from afar for a while. No doubt papa had occupied himself with it after second breakfast today and had left it for further use. One was stuck in the folder, loose sheets lying outside had been weighed down with a metal ruler for the time being, the large exercise book with gold edges and various types of paper lay open.","One afternoon Hanno had gone downstairs alone to the second floor almost an hour before dinner, which was always at four. He practiced the piano for a while and then just lounged around the living room. Half lying, half sitting on the chaise longue, he toyed with the knot in his sailor’s tie. His eyes had wandered off to one side, not looking at anything in particular, when he happened to spot an open leather writing case on his mother’s walnut desk—the family documents. He propped his elbows against the cushion behind him, his chin in one hand, and gazed at them for a while from a distance. It was obvious that Papa had been busy with them this morning, after second breakfast, and had left them there to work on them later. There were still some things in the case; other, loose pages had been pulled out, and a metal ruler served as a provisional paperweight. The large gilt-edged notebook lay open among the various papers.","One day, some three quarters of an hour before dinner, Hanno had gone down alone to the first storey. He had practised fur a long time on the piano, and now was idling about in the living-room. He half lay, half sat, on the chaise-longue, tying and untying his sailor's knot, and his eyes, raving aimlessly about, caught sight of an open portfolio on his mother's nut-wood writing-table. It was the leather case with the family papers. He rested his elbow on the sofa-cushion, and his chin in his hand, and looked at the things for a while from a distance. Papa must have had them out after second breakfast, and left them there because he was not finished with them. Some of the papers were sticking in the portfolio, some loose sheets lying outside were weighted with a metal ruler, and the large giltedged notebook with the motley paper lay there open."

"So klagte er manchmal, und darum waren es im Grunde seine liebsten Geschäfte, wenn er ganz gelegentlich, auf einem Familienspaziergange vielleicht, in eine Mühle eintrat, mit dem Besitzer, der sich geehrt fühlte, plauderte und leichthin, en passant, in guter Laune, einen guten Kontrakt mit ihm abschloß … Dergleichen lag seinem Sozius fern.","So he sometimes complained, and that's why it was basically his favorite business when he very occasionally, perhaps on a family walk, went into a mill and chatted with the owner, who felt honored, and lightly, en passant, in a good mood, made a good contract with him...

"Der Konsul schüttelte den Kopf. Er selbst hatte in letzter Zeit allerhand Besorgniserregendes verspüren müssen. Freilich, die älteren Träger und Speicherarbeiter waren bieder genug, sich nichts in den Kopf setzen zu lassen; aber unter den jungen Leuten hatte dieser und jener durch sein Benehmen Zeugnis davon gegeben, daß der neue Geist der Empörung sich tückisch Einlaß zu verschaffen gewußt hatte … Im Frühjahr hatte ein Straßenkrawall stattgefunden, obgleich eine neue Verfassung, die den Anforderungen der neuen Zeit entsprach, bereits im Entwurf vorhanden war, welcher ein wenig später, trotz des Widerspruches Lebrecht Krögers und einiger anderer störrischer alter Herren, durch Senatsdekret zum Staatsgrundgesetz erhoben wurde. Volksvertreter wurden gewählt, eine Bürgerschaft trat zusammen. Aber es gab keine Ruhe. Die Welt war ganz in Unordnung. Jeder wollte die Verfassung und das Wahlrecht revidieren, und die Bürger zankten sich. »Ständisches Prinzip!« sagten die einen; auch Johann Buddenbrook, der Konsul, sagte es. »Allgemeines Wahlrecht!« sagten die anderen; auch Hinrich Hagenström sagte es. Noch andere schrien: »Allgemeine Ständewahl!« und vielleicht wußten sie sogar, was darunter zu verstehen war. Dann schwirrten noch solche Ideen in der Luft umher wie Aufhebung des Unterschiedes zwischen Bürgern und Einwohnern, Ausdehnung der Möglichkeit, das Bürgerrecht zu erlangen, auch auf Nichtchristen … Kein Wunder, daß Buddenbrooks Trina auf Gedanken verfiel, wie der mit dem Sofa und dem seidenen Kleid! Ach, es sollte noch ärger kommen. Die Dinge drohten eine fürchterliche Wendung zu nehmen …","The Consul shook his head. He himself had had to feel all sorts of worrying things lately. Of course, the older porters and warehouse workers were conservative enough not to have anything in their heads; but among the young people such and such had borne witness by their conduct that the new spirit of indignation had known how to insidiously gain entry... In the spring a street riot had taken place, although a new constitution, adapted to the demands of the new time, was already present in the draft, which a little later, despite the objection of Lebrecht Kröger and a few other stubborn old gentlemen, was elevated to state constitution by a Senate decree. People's representatives were elected and a citizenry met. But there was no rest. The world was all in disarray. Everyone wanted to revise the constitution and the electoral law, and the citizens bickered. ""Estate principle!"" said some; also Johann Buddenbrook, the Consul, said so. ""Universal suffrage!"" said the others; Hinrich Hagenstrom said so too. Still others shouted, ""General election of estates!"" and perhaps they even knew what that meant. Then there were such ideas in the air as abolishing the distinction between citizens and residents, extending the possibility of attaining citizenship to non-Christians... No wonder Buddenbrook's Trina came up with ideas like the one about the sofa and the silk dress ! Oh, worse was to come. Things threatened to take a dreadful turn...","The consul shook his head. He had been witness of late to all sorts of disquieting incidents himself. To be sure, the older grain haulers and warehouse workers were solid enough fellows not to let notions be put in their heads. But among the younger ones a few had shown by their conduct on one occasion or other that this new rebellious spirit had wormed its way into them. Last spring there had been a riot in the streets, although a new constitution commensurate with the demands of the times was already being drafted, and, indeed, despite the objections of Lebrecht Kröger and a few other obstinate old men, it had been adopted as the basic law of the city by decree of the senate. Elections had been held, and a representative assembly had met. But still there was no peace. The world was being turned upside down. Everyone wanted to revise the constitution and amend the qualifications for voting—and the old citizens were wrangling. “Retain restricted voting rights!” one side said, including Consul Johann Buddenbrook himself. “ Universal franchise,” said the others, including Hinrich Hagenström. And then there was yet another group who cried, “Universal restricted franchise,” and some of them perhaps even knew what they meant by it. And the air was full of notions such as the abolition of the difference between citizens and inhabitants, or the easing of qualifications for citizenship, even for non-Christians. No wonder, then, that the Buddenbrooks’ Trina had taken a fancy to the sofa and a silk dress. Oh, but worse was to come. Things threatened to take a dreadful turn.","The Consul shook his head. He himself had had similar troubles.

"Sogar in der Familie selbst galt es den Kopf hochzuhalten. Seit Onkel Gotthold fern den Geschäften lebte, mit seinen kurzen Beinen und weiten Hosen sorglos in seiner bescheidenen Wohnung umherging und aus einer Blechbüchse Brustbonbons aß, denn er liebte sehr die Süßigkeiten … war seine Stimmung gegen den bevorzugten Stiefbruder mit den Jahren immer milder und resignierter geworden, was freilich nicht ausschloß, daß er angesichts seiner drei unverheirateten Töchter einige stille Genugtuung über Tonys mißglückte Ehe empfand. Um aber vor seiner Frau, der geborenen Stüwing, und besonders von den drei nun schon sechs-, sieben- und achtundzwanzig Jahre alten Mädchen zu reden, so bewiesen sie für das Unglück ihrer Cousine und den Scheidungsprozeß ein beinahe übertriebenes, ein weitaus lebhafteres Interesse, als sie damals für die Verlobung und Hochzeit selbst offenbart hatten. An den »Kindertagen«, die seit dem Tode der alten Madame Kröger Donnerstags wieder in der Mengstraße abgehalten wurden, hatte Tony keinen leichten Stand ihnen gegenüber …","Even within the family itself, it was important to hold your head high. Ever since Uncle Gotthold had been living far away from the shops, walking carelessly around his modest apartment with his short legs and wide trousers and eating breast candies out of a tin can, because he loved sweets very much … his mood towards his favorite stepbrother had become milder and more resigned over the years , which of course did not rule out the possibility that, given his three unmarried daughters, he felt some quiet satisfaction in Tony's failed marriage. But to speak in front of his wife, nee Stüwing, and especially of the three girls, now six, seven and twenty-eight years old, they showed an almost exaggerated, far more lively interest in their cousin's misfortune and the divorce process. as they had revealed at the time for the engagement and wedding itself. On the ""Children's Days"" that have been held on Thursdays since the death of old Madame Kröger, Tony did not have an easy time with them...","She even had to keep her head held high in her own family. Ever since Uncle Gotthold had retired from business to spend his days walking around his modest home in trousers that were too short and too baggy, eating cough drops from a tin box—he loved his sweets—his attitude toward his more privileged stepbrother had grown milder and more tolerant with the years, though that did not preclude his taking a certain quiet satisfaction in Tony’s ill-fated marriage, inasmuch as he himself had three unmarried daughters. And speaking of his wife, née Stüwing, and particularly of those three young women—now aged twenty-six, twenty-seven, and twenty-eight—they showed an almost extravagant interest in their cousin’s misfortunes and divorce—indeed, a much livelier one than they had exhibited at the time of her engagement and marriage. On “children’s day,” which since the death of Madame Kröger was held each Thursday on Meng Strasse, Tony had no easy time of it holding her own against them.","Even in the family Tony had to take care to hold her head up.

Still, considering his three unmarried daughters, he could not have failed to feel a quiet satisfaction over Tony's unfor-tunate venture; and his wife, born Stiiwing, and his three daughters, twenty-six, twenty-seven, and twenty-eight years old, showed an exaggerated interest in their cousin's misfor-tune and the divorce proceedings; more, in fact, than they had in her betrothal and wedding.

As I said, I'm for timely sale. I kept your signatures as long as Johann Buddenbrook was no doubt good... meanwhile I could capitalize on the arrears of interest and increase your percentage!

That’s quite absurd, my friend. No, no, I’m a man who likes to sell at the right time. You offered me eight percent, and I gave you your extension. You offered me twelve and sixteen percent, and I gave you an extension each time. But you could offer me forty now, and I wouldn’t think of extending, would not give it one thought, my friend. Now that the Westfahl Brothers have fallen on their noses in Bremen, everyone at the moment is trying to protect himself and disengage his interests from those of the aforementioned firm. As I said, I am a man who likes to sell at the right time. I kept your notes as long as Johann Buddenbrook was sure to be good for them. And meanwhile I could add the unpaid interest to the capital and raise the percent. But you hold on to something only as long as it is rising in value or at least steady. And when it begins to fall, you sell. Which is to say, I want my capital.”","""Nothing in it, nothing in it, my friend. Very funny, very amusing. Oh, yes, I'm in favour of selling at the right time.

Now, you might offer me forty per cent, and I shouldn't consider it--not for a moment. Since Brother West-fall in Bremen fell on his nose, everybody is for the moment freeing himself from the well-known firm and getting on a sound basis. As I say, I'm for selling at the right time. I've held your signatures as long as Johann Buddenbrook was good--in the meantime I could write up the interest on the capital and increase the per cent. But one only keeps a thing so long as it is rising or at least keeping steady. When it begins to fall, one sells--which is the same as saying I want my capital."""

"Seine Stimme brach sich beim Sprechen, merklich im Wechseln begriffen, was bei seinem Freunde noch nicht der Fall war. Er war in gleichem Maße gewachsen wie dieser, aber sonst war er ganz und gar derselbe geblieben. Immer noch trug er einen Anzug von unbestimmter Farbe, an dem hie und da ein Knopf fehlte, und dessen Gesäß von einem großen Flicken gebildet ward. Immer noch waren seine Hände nicht ganz reinlich, aber schmal und außerordentlich edel gebildet, mit langen, schlanken Fingern und spitz zulaufenden Nägeln. Und immer noch fiel sein flüchtig in der Mitte gescheiteltes, rötlich gelbes Haar in eine alabasterweiße und makellose Stirn, unter welcher, tief und scharf zugleich, die hellblauen Augen blitzten … Der Gegensatz zwischen seiner arg vernachlässigten Toilette und der Rassereinheit dieses zartknochigen Gesichts mit der ganz leicht gebogenen Nase und der ein wenig geschürzten Oberlippe sprang jetzt noch mehr in die Augen als ehemals.","His voice broke as he spoke, noticeably changing, which was not the case with his friend. He had grown to the same extent as this one, but otherwise he had remained completely the same. He was still wearing a suit of an indefinite color, missing a button here and there, and a large patch on the buttocks. His hands were still not entirely clean, but they were slender and extraordinarily noble, with long, slender fingers and pointed nails. And still his reddish yellow hair, briefly parted in the middle, fell into an alabaster-white and flawless forehead, under which, deep and sharp at the same time, the light blue eyes flashed ... The contrast between his badly neglected toilet and the racial purity of this delicate-boned face with the whole slightly curved nose and the slightly pursed upper lip now caught the eye even more than before.","His voice was obviously changing and cracked when he spoke, which was not the case yet for his friend. And, like Hanno, he had grown considerably. But otherwise he was still very much the same. His suit was still an indeterminate color, with a button missing here and there, and the seat of his pants consisted of a large patch. As always, his hands were none too clean, but they were still narrow and exceptionally well formed, with long, slender fingers and tapering fingernails. His reddish-blond hair was still carelessly parted down the middle and fell across a flawless, alabaster forehead, beneath which deep-set but keen, bright blue eyes flashed. The contrast between his very unkempt appearance and the noble pedigree in the delicate bone structure of his face with its slightly aquiline nose and slightly pursed upper lip was more striking than ever.","His voice cracked as he spoke, because it was changing, which Hanno's had not yet begun to do. He had kept pace 311 BUDDENBRD DKS with Hanno in his growth, but his looks had not altered, and he still wore a dingy suit of no particular colour, with a button or so missing and a big patch in the seat. His hands, too, were not quite clean; narrow and aristocratic-looking though they were, with long, slender fingers and tapering nails. But his brow was still pure as alabaster beneath the carelessly parted reddish-yellow hair that fell over it, and the glance of the sparkling blue eyes was as keen and as profound as ever. In fact, the contrast was even more striking between his neglected toilette and the racial purity of his face, with its delicate bony strurturc, slightly aquiline nose, and short upper lip, upon which the down was begin-ning to show."
"Die Treue und Hingebung der guten Ida Jungmann, die nun schon länger als drei Jahrzehnte den Buddenbrooks diente, war ja mit Gold nicht zu bezahlen. Sie hatte die vorhergehende Generation mit Aufopferung gehegt und gepflegt: Hanno aber trug sie auf Händen, sie hüllte ihn gänzlich in Zärtlichkeit und Sorgfalt ein, sie liebte ihn abgöttisch und ging in ihrem naiven und unerschütterlichen Glauben an seine absolut bevorzugte und bevorrechtigte Stellung in der Welt oftmals bis zum Absurden. Sie war, galt es, für ihn zu handeln, von erstaunlicher und manchmal peinlicher Unverfrorenheit. Gelegentlich eines Einkaufs beim Konditor zum Beispiel unterließ sie es niemals, sehr ungeniert in die ausgestellten Schalen hineinzugreifen, um ihm diese oder jene Süßigkeit zuzustecken, ohne dafür zu bezahlen – denn konnte der Mann sich nicht nur geehrt fühlen? Und vor einem umlagerten Schaufenster war sie sofort bei der Hand, die Leute in ihrem westpreußischen Dialekt freundlich, aber entschieden um Platz für ihren Schützling zu ersuchen. Ja, er war in ihren Augen etwas so ganz Besonderes, daß sie kaum je ein anderes Kind würdig gehalten hatte, mit ihm in Berührung zu kommen. Was den kleinen Kai betraf, so war die beiderseitige Zuneigung stärker gewesen als ihr Mißtrauen; auch hatte der Name sie ein wenig bestochen. Gesellten sich aber auf dem Mühlenwall, wenn sie sich mit Hanno auf einer Bank niedergelassen hatte, andere Kinder mit ihrer Begleitung zu ihnen, so erhob Fräulein Jungmann sich beinahe sogleich und ging unter irgendeinem Vorwande von Verspätung oder Zugwind von dannen. Die Erklärungen, die sie dem kleinen Johann dafür zuteil werden ließ, waren geeignet, in ihm die Vorstellung zu erwecken, als seien alle seine Altersgenossen mit Skrofeln und »Bösen Säften« schwer behaftet, – nur er nicht. Und das trug nicht gerade dazu bei, seine sowieso schon mangelnde Zutraulichkeit und Unbefangenheit zu stärken.","The loyalty and devotion of the good Ida Jungmann, who had now been serving the Buddenbrooks for more than three decades, could not be bought in gold. She had nursed and cared for the previous generation with devotion: but Hanno carried her on hands, she enveloped him completely in tenderness and care, she adored him, and in her naïve and unshakable belief in his absolutely privileged and privileged position in the world often to the point of absurdity. She had an astonishing and sometimes embarrassing audacity when it came to acting for him. On occasion, for example, when she was shopping at the confectioner's, she never failed to reach into the bowls on display, very unabashedly, in order to slip him this or that sweet without paying for it - because couldn't the man only feel honored? And in front of a besieged shop window, she was immediately on hand to ask the people in her West Prussian dialect in a friendly but firm manner for space for her protégé. Yes, he was so very special in her eyes that she had scarcely considered any other child worthy of touching him. As for little Kai, their mutual affection had outweighed their distrust; also the name had bribed her a little. But if other children and their companions joined them on the Mühlenwall, when she had sat down with Hanno on a bench, Fraulein Jungmann got up almost immediately and left under some pretext of being late or a draft. The explanations she gave little Johann for this were apt to awaken in him the idea that all his contemporaries were afflicted with scrofula and ""bad juices"" - only he was not. And that didn't exactly help to strengthen his already lacking trust and impartiality.","The loyalty and self-sacrifice of good Ida Jungmann, who had served the Buddenbrooks for three decades now, could never be repaid in gold. She had devotedly tended and nursed the previous generation—but Hanno was the apple of her eye. She wrapped him up in all her tenderness and concern, she idolized him, and at times she carried to absurdity her naïve, unshakable belief that he had an absolute right to his privileged place in the world. When called upon to act in his behalf, she could be amazingly, sometimes embarrassingly brazen. If she happened to be out shopping with him at the pastry shop, for example, she would never forget to reach coolly into one of the bowls of sweets on the counter and hand him something, without even thinking of paying—the baker should take it as an honor, shouldn’t he? And if a crowd was gathered at a display window, she would take her charge by the hand and then, in her friendly but very determined West Prussian dialect, ask people to make way for him. Indeed, in her eyes he was so special that she found hardly any other children worthy of close association. When it came to the little count, her initial mistrust was overcome by the boys’ affection for one another—and his title had dazzled her a bit, too. If she happened to be sitting with Hanno on a bench beside the Mühlenwall, however, and other children with their governesses would sit down next to them, Fräulein Jungmann would get up almost at once and move on after making some excuse about being late or sitting in a draft. The explanations she offered little Johann for this behavior could only lead him to believe that all his contemporaries either were scrofulous or had what she called “evil humors”—and that he was the lone exception. This did not exactly enhance his already somewhat meager sense of confidence and ease in dealing with other people.","The faithful devotion of the good Ida could not be repaid 127 with gold. She had been in the family now for more than thirty years. She had cared for the previous generations with self-abnegation; but Hannu she carried in her arms, lapped him in tender care, and loved him to idolatry. She had a naive, unshakable belief in his privileged station in life, which sometimes went to the length of absurdity. In whatever touched him she showed a surprising, even an unpleasant effrontery. Suppose, for instance, she took him with her to buy cakes at the pastry-shop: she would poke among the sweets on the counter and select a piece for Hanno, which she would coolly hand him without paying for it--the man should feel himself honoured, indeed! And before a crowded show-window she would ask the people in front, in her west-Prussian dialect, pleasantly enough, but with de- cision, to make a place for her charge. He was so uncommon in her eyes that she felt there was hardly another child in the world worthy to touch him. In little Kai's case, the mutual preference of the two children had been too strong for her. Possibly she was a little taken by his name, too. But if other children came up to them on the Mill-wall, as she sat with Hanno on a bench, Fraulein Junginann would get up almost at once, make some excuse or other--it was late, or there was a draught--and take her charge away. The pretexts she gave to little Johann would have led him to believe that all his con- temporaries were either scrofulous of full of ""evil humours,"" and that he himself was a solitary exception; which did not tend to increase his already deficient confidence and ease of manner."

"Nichts gegen Herrn Permaneders gutes Herz … Er war aufrichtig erschüttert gewesen, dicke Tränen waren angesichts seines leblosen Kindes aus den verquollenen Äuglein über die zu aufgetriebenen Wangen in den ausgefransten Schnauzbart geflossen, und er hatte mehrere Male mit schwerem Seufzen hervorgebracht: »Es is halt a Kreiz! A Kreiz is'! O mei!« Aber seine »G'müatlichkeit« hatte nach Tonys Begriffen nicht lange genug darunter gelitten, seine Abendstunden im Hofbräuhaus hatten ihn bald darüber hinweggebracht, und mit dem bequemen, gutmütigen, ein bißchen mürrischen und ein bißchen stumpfsinnigen Fatalismus, der in seinem »Es is halt a Kreiz!« enthalten war, »wurstelte« er fort.","Nothing against Herr Permaneder's good heart...

But his 'comfortability' hadn't suffered from it long enough in Tony's terms, his evening hours at the Hofbrauhaus had soon gotten over it, and with the comfortable, good-natured, a little dour and a little dull fatalism that was in his ""It's just a circle!"" was included, he muddled on.","Not that Herr Permaneder did not have a good heart. He was terribly shaken at the sight of his lifeless child, and great tears fell from his swollen eyes and rolled down his pudgy cheeks and into his frayed mustache. And with heavy sighs he managed to say several times, “Oh my, what a pain, what a pain in th’ ol’!” But as far as Tony could see, it was not long before he was “takin’ things easy” again. His evenings at the Hofbräuhaus soon helped him over his suffering, and with the contented, kindly, half-grumpy, half-doltish fatalism expressed in those words “it’s a pain in th’ ol’,” he “muddled” through.","There was nothing against Herr Permaneder's good heart. He was truly shaken by the death of the child; big tears rolled down out of his bulging eyes upon his puffy cheeks and on into his frizzled beard.

After a few evenings, he sought the Hofbrau House for consolation, and was soon, as he always said, ""mud-dling along"" again in his old, good-natured, comfortable, grumbling way, with the easy fatalism natural to him."

"Es war nicht anders mit dem Schlittschuhlaufen zur Winterszeit und mit dem Baden in der hölzernen Anstalt des Herrn Asmussen, unten am Fluß, im Sommer … »Baden! Schwimmen!« hatte Doktor Langhals gesagt. »Der Junge muß baden und schwimmen!« Und der Senator war vollständig damit einverstanden gewesen. Was aber hauptsächlich Hanno veranlaßte, sich vom Baden sowohl wie vom Schlittschuhlaufen und von den »Turnspielen«, sobald es nur immer anging, fernzuhalten, war der Umstand, daß die beiden Söhne des Konsuls Hagenström, die sich an allen diesen Dingen ehrenvoll beteiligten, es auf ihn abgesehen hatten und, obgleich sie doch in dem Hause seiner Großmutter wohnten, keine Gelegenheit versäumten, ihn mit ihrer Stärke zu demütigen und zu quälen. Sie kniffen und verhöhnten ihn bei den »Turnspielen«, sie stießen ihn in den Schneekehricht auf der Eisbahn, sie kamen im Schwimmbassin mit bedrohlichen Lauten durch das Wasser auf ihn zu … Hanno versuchte nicht zu entfliehen, was übrigens wenig nützlich gewesen wäre. Er stand da, mit seinen Mädchenarmen, bis zum Bauche in dem ziemlich trüben Wasser, auf dessen Oberfläche hie und da grüne Gebilde von Pflanzen, sogenanntes Gänsefutter, umhertrieben, und sah mit zusammengezogenen Brauen, einem finsteren Senkblick und leicht verzerrten Lippen den beiden entgegen, die, sicher ihrer Beute, mit langen, schäumenden Sprungschritten daherkamen. Sie hatten Muskeln an den Armen, die beiden Hagenströms, und damit umklammerten sie ihn und tauchten ihn, tauchten ihn recht lange, so daß er ziemlich viel von dem unreinlichen Wasser schluckte und lange nachher, sich hin und her wendend, nach Atem rang … Ein einziges Mal ward er ein wenig gerächt. Gerade als ihn nämlich eines Nachmittags die beiden Hagenströms unter die Wasserfläche hielten, stieß der eine von ihnen plötzlich einen Wut- und Schmerzensschrei aus und hob sein eines fleischiges Bein empor, von dem das Blut in großen Tropfen rann. Neben ihm aber kam Kai Graf Mölln zum Vorschein, welcher sich auf irgendeine Weise das Eintrittsgeld verschafft hatte, unversehens unter Wasser herbeigeschwommen war und den jungen Hagenström gebissen – mit allen Zähnen ins Bein gebissen hatte, wie ein kleiner wütender Hund. Seine blauen Augen blitzten durch das rötlich-blonde Haar, das naß darüber hing … Ach, es erging ihm schlecht für seine Tat, dem kleinen Grafen, und übel zugerichtet stieg er aus dem Bassin. Allein Konsul Hagenströms starker Sohn hinkte doch beträchtlich, als er nach Hause ging …","It was no different with ice-skating in winter and bathing in Mr. Asmussen's wooden asylum down by the river in summer . . . 'Bathing! Swim!' Doctor Longneck had said. 'The boy must bathe and swim!' And the senator had agreed entirely. But what mainly caused Hanno to stay away from bathing, ice-skating and ""gymnastics"" whenever possible was the fact that Consul Hagenstrom's two sons, who took an honorable part in all these things, were after him and, though they lived in his grandmother's house, never missed an opportunity to humiliate and torment him with their strength. They pinched and taunted him during the “gymnastics games”, they pushed him into the snow sweepings on the ice rink, they came at him through the water in the swimming pool with threatening noises… Hanno didn’t try to escape, which incidentally would have been of little use. He stood there, with his girlish arms, up to his belly in the rather murky water, on the surface of which green formations of plants, so-called goose feed, floated here and there, and looked at the two with knitted brows, a dark look and slightly pursed lips. who, sure of their prey, came along with long, foaming strides. They had muscles on their arms, the two Hagenstroms, and with that they clasped him and dunked him, dunked him for quite a long time, so that he swallowed quite a bit of the unclean water and long afterwards, tossing and turning, gasping for breath... On only once was he avenged a little. One afternoon, just as the two Hagenstroms were holding him under the surface of the water, one of them suddenly uttered a cry of rage and pain and lifted up one of his fleshy legs, from which blood ran in large drops. Next to him, however, appeared Kai Graf Mölln, who had somehow managed to get the entrance fee, unexpectedly swam under the water and bit the young Hagenstrom – biting his leg with all his teeth, like a little angry dog. His blue eyes gleamed through the reddish-blond hair that hung wet over it... Ah, he fared badly for what he had done, the little count, and badly battered he climbed out of the basin. But Consul Hagenstrom's strong son walked home with a serious limp...","It was no different when it came to ice-skating in winter or to swimming in summer down by the river, in the fenced-in area run by Herr Asmussen. “Bathing and swimming,” Dr. Langhals had said. “The boy must go swimming.” And the senator was in complete agreement. But the main reason that Hanno avoided, if at all possible, going swimming, or ice-skating, or joining in gymnastics, was the fact that Consul Hagenström’s two sons, who participated in all such activities to great acclaim, had it in for him; and although they lived in his grandmother’s house, they never missed a chance to humiliate and bully him with their greater strength. They pinched him and mocked him during gymnastics; they pushed him into piles of shoveled snow when he tried to skate; they came storming across the swimming pool toward him, making menacing noises. Hanno did not try to escape—that would have been pointless in any case. He stood there up to his waist in the rather muddy water, his skinny girl’s arms at his sides, his mouth slightly askew, and while green clumps of so-called goose grass drifted past him, he scowled and watched grimly from one corner of his eye as they approached in long, foaming leaps, sure of their prey. Both the Hagenström boys had muscular arms, and they would clamp them around him and duck him, duck him so long that he swallowed a great deal of dirty water, and even after he came up, twisting and turning, he had to fight for his breath for quite a while. But once he did get a little revenge. One afternoon, just as the two Hagenströms were holding him under the water, one of them suddenly started screaming with rage and pain and lifted up his stout leg—large drops of blood were running down it. And suddenly Count Kai Mölln appeared at his side; somehow he had managed to find money to pay his way in, and quite unexpectedly he had come swimming by and bitten the Hagenström boy—a big bite, using all his teeth, right in the leg, like a mean little dog. His blue eyes flashed from under the wet, reddish blond hair that hung down in his face. But the little count paid for his deed, did he ever, and he climbed up out of the pool badly battered. All the same, Consul Hagenström’s rugged son limped noticeably as he walked home.","It was the same with the skating in the wintertime, and with the bathing in summer at the wooden bathing establishment of Hcrr Asmussen, down on the river. "" Bathing and swimming--let the boy have bathing and swimming--he must bathe and swim,"" Dr. Langhals had said. And the Senator was entirely of the Same opinion. But Hanno had a reason for absenting himself from the bathing, as well as from the skating and the drill class. The two sons of Consul Hagen-striim, who took part in all such exercises with preat skill and credit, singled Hanno out at once. And though they lived in his own grandmother's house, that fact did not pre-vent them from making his life miserable. They lost no opportunity of tormenting him. At drill they pinched him and derided him. They rolled him in the dirty snow at the ice-rink; and in the water they came up to him with horrid noises. Hanno did not try to escape. It would have been useless anyhow. He stood, with his girlish arms, up to his miJdle in the turbid water of the pool, which had large1 patches of duck-weed growing on it, and awaited his tormentors with a scowl--a dark look and twisted lips. They, sure of their prey, came on with long splashing strides. They had muscular arms, these two young Hagenstrbms, and they clutched him round his body and ducked him--ducked him a good long time, so that he swallowed rather a lot of the dirty water and gasped for breath a long time after. One single time he was a little avenged. One afternoon the two Hagenstrbms were holding him down under the water, when one of them suddenly gave a shriek of pain and fury and lifted his plump leg, from which drops of blood were oozing. Beside him rose the head of Kai, Count Mblln, who had somehow got hold of the price of admission, swum up in-visible in the water, and bitten young Hagenstrb'm--bitten with all his teeth into 'his leg, like a furious little dog. His blue eyes flashed through the red-blond hair that hung down wet all over his face. Ho paid richly for the deed, did the little Count, and left the swimming-pool much the worse for the encounter. But Consul Hagenstrbm's son limped perceptibly when he went home."
"Die Trauerstimmung lag noch zu schwer und ernst in der Luft, als daß Tony ihrer Entrüstung in lauteren und stärkeren Worten hätte Ausdruck geben mögen. Es war am Tage der Testamentseröffnung, zwei Wochen nach des Konsuls Ableben, nachmittags halb sechs Uhr. Die Konsulin Buddenbrook hatte ihren Bruder in die Mengstraße gebeten, damit er sich mit Thomas und Herrn Marcus, dem Prokuristen, an einer Unterredung über die Verfügungen des Verstorbenen und die Vermögensverhältnisse beteilige, und Tony hatte den Entschluß kundgetan, gleichfalls an den Auseinandersetzungen teilzunehmen. Dieses Interesse, hatte sie gesagt, sei sie der Firma sowohl wie der Familie schuldig, und sie trug Sorge, dieser Zusammenkunft den Charakter einer Sitzung, eines Familienrates zu verleihen. Sie hatte die Fenstervorhänge geschlossen und trotz der beiden Paraffinlampen, die auf dem ausgezogenen, grüngedeckten Speisetisch brannten, zum Überfluß sämtliche Kerzen auf den großen vergoldeten Kandelabern entzündet. Außerdem hatte sie auf der Tafel eine Menge Schreibpapiers und gespitzter Bleistifte verteilt, von denen niemand wußte, wozu sie eigentlich gebraucht werden sollten.","The mood of mourning was still too heavy and serious in the air for Tony to express their indignation in louder and stronger words. It was on the day of the reading of the will, two weeks after the consul's death, at half past five in the afternoon. The Consul Buddenbrook had asked her brother to come to Mengstrasse so that he could take part in a discussion with Thomas and Herr Marcus, the general manager, about the dispositions of the deceased and the financial situation, and Tony had announced his decision to also take part in the discussions. She had said that she owed this interest to the company as well as to the family, and she took care to give this meeting the character of a meeting, a family council. She had closed the window curtains and, in spite of the two paraffin lamps burning on the extended, green-covered dining table, she had lit all the candles on the large gilded candelabra. She had also spread out on the board a lot of writing paper and sharpened pencils, which no one knew what they were actually supposed to be used for.","Tony would have liked to express her outrage in stronger, franker terms, but the air of mourning still lay heavy over the room. The consul had been dead for two weeks now—it was half past five in the afternoon of the day on which the will was to be read. Madame Buddenbrook had invited her brother to Meng Strasse to join with Thomas and Herr Marcus, the chief clerk, in a discussion of the provisions in the deceased’s will and of the general financial situation; and Tony had let it be known that she would likewise be taking part in the conference. She owed both the firm and the family that much, she had said, and she was anxious to give the meeting the character of a formal family council. She had drawn the curtains, and although the two paraffin lamps on the dining table provided sufficient light, she had lit every candle on the tall gold-plated candelabra. The dining table was pulled out to its full extent and covered with a green cloth, and Tony had made sure that plenty of writing paper and sharpened pencils had been distributed around it—though no one was exactly sure what they might be needed for.","The sense of mourning still lay too heavily on the air for Tony to give expression to her outraged feelings in livelier or 251 stronger terms. It was the day on which the will had been read, two weeks after the death of the Consul, at half-past five in the afternoon. Frau Consul Buddenbrook had invited her brother to Meng Street, in order that he might talk over the provisions made by the deceased with Thomas and with Heir Marcus the confidential clerk. Tony had announced her intention to be present at the settlements. This attention, she said, she oweJ to the firm as well as to the family, and she took pains to give the meeting the character of a family coun-cil. She had closed the curtains, and despite the two oil lamps on the green-covered dining-table, drawn out to its full extent, she had lighted all the candles in the great gilded candelabrum as well. And, though there was no particular need of them, she had put on the table a quantity of writing paper and sharpened pencils."

"»Nie!« sagte Tony noch einmal. »Nie!« Aber dann erzählte sie, und obgleich man nicht jedes Wort verstand, denn sie sprach in den faltigen Tuchrock der Konsulin hinein, und ihr Bericht war explosiv und von Ausrufen der äußersten Entrüstung zerrissen, so ward doch klar, daß ganz einfach folgender Sachverhalt bestand.","""Never!""

""Never!"" And then she told her story. It was not all intelligible, for she spoke into the folds of her Mother's stuff gown, and broke into her own nar-rative with explosions of passionate anger.

"»Seht ihr, die ist schon wieder in der Apotheke, und du, Tony, siehst aus, als wolltest du jeden Augenblick einschlafen. Nein, das geht nicht länger.

"Und was die »Partie« betrifft?… Ach, ich ängstige mich beinahe davor, daß Stephan Kistenmaker und Hermann Hagenström und Peter Döhlmann und Onkel Justus und die ganze Stadt mich pfiffig anblinzeln wird, wenn man von der Partie erfährt; denn mein zukünftiger Schwiegervater ist Millionär … Mein Gott, was läßt sich darüber sagen? Es gibt so viel Halbes in uns, das so oder so gedeutet werden kann.

I admire Gerda Arnoldsen with enthusiasm, but I am not at all inclined to delve deep enough into myself to fathom whether and to what extent the high dowry, which was whispered in a rather cynical way in my ear at the very first introduction, to this one Enthusiasm contributed.

"Die Abwicklung der Geschäfte also begann unter der Leitung Herrn Kistenmakers und des alten Herrn Marcus und sie nahm einen außerordentlich kläglichen Verlauf. Die gegebene Frist war kurz, sie sollte mit buchstäblicher Genauigkeit innegehalten werden, die Zeit drängte. Die schwebenden Angelegenheiten wurden in übereilter und ungünstiger Weise erledigt. Ein überstürzter und unvorteilhafter Verkauf folgte dem anderen. Das Lager, die Speicher wurden mit großem Schaden zu Gelde gemacht. Und was Herrn Kistenmakers Übereifer nicht verdarb, das vollbrachte die Saumseligkeit des alten Herrn Marcus, von dem man sich in der Stadt erzählte, daß er zur Winterszeit, bevor er ausgehe, nicht nur seinen Paletot und Hut, sondern auch seinen Spazierstock sorgfältig am Ofen wärme, und der, bot sich einmal eine günstige Konjunktur, sicherlich die Gelegenheit vorübergehen ließ … Kurzum, die Verluste häuften sich. Thomas Buddenbrook hatte auf dem Papiere ein Vermögen von sechsmalhundertundfünfzigtausend Mark hinterlassen; ein Jahr nach der Testamentseröffnung stellte sich heraus, daß mit dieser Summe im entferntesten nicht zu rechnen war …","The handling of business began under the direction of Mr. Kistenmaker and old Mr. Marcus, and it took an extremely poor course. The deadline given was short, it was to be met with literal accuracy, time was of the essence. The pending matters were settled in a hasty and unfavorable manner. One hasty and unfavorable sale followed the other. The camp, the granaries were cashed in with great damage. And what Mr. Kistenmaker's overzeal did not spoil was the tardiness of old Mr. Marcus, of whom it was said in the town that in winter before he went out he carefully warmed not only his paletot and hat, but also his walking stick at the stove , and which, once the economy was favorable, certainly let the opportunity slip by... In short, the losses piled up. Thomas Buddenbrook had left a fortune of six hundred and fifty thousand marks on paper; A year after the opening of the will, it turned out that this amount was not at all to be expected...","And so, under the direction of Herr Kistenmaker and old Herr Marcus, the firm began to be liquidated—and things went from bad to worse. The prescribed period was very limited, but it had to be observed to the letter and time was growing short. Pending business contracts were sold off much too quickly and on disadvantageous terms. One hasty and unprofitable sale followed another. The warehouses and stored grain were sold off at a considerable loss. And what didn’t fall to Herr Kistenmaker’s excess of zeal was ruined by old Herr Marcus’s procrastination. Word around town had it that the old man carefully warmed not just his overcoat and hat beside the stove before going out in winter, but his walking stick as well. And if an opportunity for selling at a profit did present itself, he was sure to let it slip past. In short, the losses piled up. Thomas Buddenbrook’s estate had been valued on paper at 650,000 marks. Within a year after the reading of the will, it was clear that nothing even close to that sum could be reckoned with.","The liquidation of the business began, under the auspices of Herr Kistenmaker and old Herr Marcus; and it took a most deplorable course. The time was short, and it must bs punctiliously kept to. The pending business was dis-posed of on hurried and unfavourable terms. One precipitate and disadvantageous sale followed another. The granaries and warehouses were turned into money at a great loss; and what was not lost by Herr Kistenmaker's oveT-zealousness was wasted by the procrastination of old Herr Marcus. In town they said that the old man, before he left his house in winter warmed not only his coat and hat, but his walking-dtick as well. If ever a favourable opportunity arose, he invariably let it 'slip through his fingers. And so the losses piled up.

Äußerlich aber blieb er ganz ruhig, veränderte seine Lage im Bette nicht und riß nur rasch, aus irgendeinem verwischten Morgentraume gejagt, die Augen auf.","Hanno Buddenbrook was deeply shocked. As every morning, at the sudden onset of this at once malicious and innocent noise, on the bedside table, close to his ear, his bowels contracted with rage, lamentation and despair.

It was like this every morning. His very entrails rebelled, in rage, protest, and despair, at the onslaught of this at once cruel and faithful monitor standing on the bedside table close to his ear.

"Übrigens hatte Tony sicherlich nicht aus Schüchternheit dem jungen Hagenström den Kuß verweigert. Sie war ein ziemlich keckes Geschöpf, das mit seiner Ausgelassenheit seinen Eltern, im besondern dem Konsul, manche Sorge bereitete, und obgleich sie ein intelligentes Köpfchen besaß, das flink in der Schule erlernte, was man begehrte, so war ihr Betragen in so hohem Grade mangelhaft, daß schließlich sogar die Schulvorsteherin, welche Fräulein Agathe Vermehren hieß, ein wenig schwitzend vor Verlegenheit, in der Mengstraße erschien und der Konsulin höflichst anheim gab, der jungen Tochter eine ernstliche Ermahnung zuteil werden zu lassen – denn dieselbe habe sich, trotz vieler liebevoller Verwarnungen, auf der Straße aufs neue offenkundigen Unfugs schuldig gemacht.","Incidentally, it was certainly not out of shyness that Tony refused to kiss young Hagenstrom. She was a rather perky creature, whose exuberance caused some concern to his parents, especially the Consul, and though she had an intelligent mind, quick to learn what was desired at school, her conduct was in such a high degree unsatisfactory that finally even the headmistress, whose name was Miss Agathe Vermehren, appeared in Mengstrasse, sweating a little with embarrassment, and politely told the consul to give the young daughter a serious admonition - because she had, despite many loving ones Warnings, made guilty of blatant mischief again on the street.","Tony had certainly not denied young Hagenström his kiss out of shyness, by the way. She was a fairly cheeky young thing, whose high spirits had caused her parents, in particular the consul, considerable worry, and although she was bright enough and could quickly learn anything demanded of her in school, her behavior was so unsatisfactory that the principal, one Fräulein Agatha Vermehren, finally had to visit Meng Strasse and, though perspiring with embarrassment, politely suggested to the consul’s wife that her young daughter be given a serious reprimand—for despite many well-intended warnings she had once again been guilty of a flagrant piece of mischief right out on the street.","It was hardly out of shyness that Tony had refused the kiss. She was on the whole a forward damsel, and had given the Consul no little disquiet with her tomboy ways. She had a good little head, and did as well in the school as one could desire; but her conduct in other ways was far from satisfactory. . Things even went So far that one day the school-mistress, a certain Fr�ulein Agathe Vermehren, felt obliged to call upon the Frau Consul, and, flushed with embarrassment, to suggest with all due politeness that the child should receive a paternal admonition. It seemed that Tony, despite frequent correction, had been guilty, not for the first time, of creating a disturbance in the street!"
"Es dauerte drei oder vier Sekunden. Herrn Brechts bebende Kraftanstrengung teilte sich Thomas Buddenbrooks ganzem Körper mit, er wurde ein wenig auf seinem Sitze emporgezogen und hörte ein leise piependes Geräusch in der Kehle des Zahnarztes … Plötzlich gab es einen furchtbaren Stoß, eine Erschütterung, als würde ihm das Genick gebrochen, begleitet von einem kurzen Knacken und Krachen. Er öffnete hastig die Augen … Der Druck war fort, aber sein Kopf dröhnte, der Schmerz tobte heiß in dem entzündeten und mißhandelten Kiefer, und er fühlte deutlich, daß dies nicht das Bezweckte, nicht die wahre Lösung der Frage, sondern eine verfrühte Katastrophe sei, die die Sachlage nur verschlimmerte … Herr Brecht war zurückgetreten.

Herr Brecht's trembling exertion communicated itself to Thomas Buddenbrook's whole body, he was pulled up a little on his seat and heard a soft beeping noise in the dentist's throat... Suddenly there was a terrible jolt, accompanied by a jolt, as if his neck were being broken from a brief snap and crack. He hastily opened his eyes... The pressure was gone, but his head was pounding, the pain raging hot in the inflamed and battered jaw, and he felt distinctly that this was not the intended, not the true solution of the question, but a premature catastrophe , which only aggravated the situation... Herr Brecht had resigned. Leaning against the instrument cabinet, looking like Death, he said, ""The crown... I thought so.""","It took three or four seconds. Herr Brecht quivered with the exertion, and Thomas Buddenbrook could feel the tremor pass through his whole body; he was pulled up out of his chair a little and heard a soft squeak coming from somewhere deep in the dentist’s throat.

The pressure was gone, but his whole head throbbed, and hot pain raged in his inflamed and maltreated jaw; and he felt quite clearly that this had not been what was intended, that this was not the solution to his problem, but simply a premature catastrophe that had only made matters worse.

Suddenly there was a fearful blow, a violent shaking as if his neck were broken, accompanied by a quick cracking, crackling noise. The pressure was gone, but his head buzzed, the pain throbbed madly in the inflamed and ill-used jaw; and he had the clearest impression that the thing had not been successful: that the extraction of the tooth was not the solution of the difficulty, but merely a premature catas-trophe which only made matters worse. Herr Brecht had retreated. He was leaning against his instrument-cupboard, and he looked like death. He said: ""The crown--I thought so."""
"Aber er ging nicht zur Ruhe, sondern nahm seine Wanderung wieder auf. Er dachte an die Säcke mit Weizen, Roggen, Hafer und Gerste, welche die Böden des »Löwen«, des »Walfisches«, der »Eiche« und der »Linde« füllen sollten, sann über dem Preise, dem – oh, durchaus nicht unanständigen Preise, den er zu bieten beabsichtigte, stieg um Mitternacht leise ins Kontor hinunter und schrieb bei Herrn Marcus' Stearinkerze in einem Zuge einen Brief an Herrn von Maiboom auf Pöppenrade, einen Brief, der, als er ihn mit fieberheißem und schwerem Kopfe durchlas, ihm als der beste und taktvollste seines Lebens erschien.","But he did not go to rest, but resumed his wanderings. He thought of the sacks of wheat, rye, oats, and barley that were to fill the bottoms of the Lion, the Whale, the Oak, and the Lime, thought of the price, which—oh, not at all indecent prices he intended to offer, went down quietly to the office at midnight and, at Herr Marcus' Stearinkerze, wrote a letter in one go to Herr von Maiboom on Pöppenrade, a letter which, when he read it with a feverish, heavy head, seemed to him the best and most tactful of his life.","He did not go to bed, however. He began wandering the rooms again. He thought of the sacks of wheat, rye, oats, and barley that would fill the “Lion,” the “Whale,” the “Oak,” and the “Linden,” reflected on the offer he planned to make—and it would certainly not be an indelicate offer. Around midnight he went downstairs to the office, and by the light of Herr Marcus’s stearin candle he wrote a letter to Herr von Maiboom of Pöppenrade in one draft, and as he reread it, his head pounding and feverish, it seemed to him the best, most tactful letter he had ever written.","But he did not go. He took up his wanderings again. He thought about the sacks of wheat and rye and oats and barley which should fill the lofts of the Lion, ihe Walrus, the Oak, and the Linden; he thought about the price he intended to ask--of course it should not be an extravagant price. He went softly at midnight down into the counting-house and, by the light of Herr Marcus' tallow candle, wrote a letter to Herr von Maiboom of Poppenrade--a letter which, as he read it through, his head feeling feverish and heavv, he thought was the best and most tactful he had ever written."

"Aber so fürchterlich er sich gebärdete, – langsam und Schritt für Schritt, durch Gewöhnung und Zureden, zog sie ihn zu sich herüber.","But fearful as he behaved, slowly and step by step, through habit and persuasion, she drew him over to her.","But although he carried on most dreadfully—slowly, inch by inch, she won him over by practice and persuasion.","But let him gesture as furiously as he would, she brought IDS him over--slowly, by easy stages, by persistent playing and persuasion."
"Tony schlief fest und gut die erste Nacht in der Mengstraße, und sie stieg am nächsten Morgen, den 22. September, erfrischt und ruhigen Sinnes ins Frühstückszimmer hinunter. Es war noch ganz früh, kaum sieben Uhr. Nur Mamsell Jungmann war schon anwesend und bereitete den Morgenkaffee.","Tony slept soundly and well that first night on Mengstrasse, and the next morning, September 22, she went down to the breakfast room refreshed and calm.

"Im Halbkreise saßen der Konsul, seine Gattin, Tony, Tom und Klothilde um den runden gedeckten Tisch, auf dem das benutzte Service schimmerte, während Christian, ein wenig seitwärts, mit einem unglücklichen Gesichtsausdruck Ciceros zweite Catilinarische Rede präparierte. Der Konsul war mit seiner Zigarre und den »Anzeigen« beschäftigt. Die Konsulin hatte ihre Seidenstickerei sinken lassen und sah lächelnd der kleinen Klara zu, die mit Ida Jungmann auf dem Rasenplatze Veilchen suchte, denn es gab zuweilen Veilchen dort. Tony hatte den Kopf in beide Hände gestützt und las versunken in Hoffmanns »Serapionsbrüdern«, während Tom sie mit einem Grashalm ganz vorsichtig im Nacken kitzelte, was sie aus Klugheit aber durchaus nicht bemerkte. Und Klothilde, die mager und ältlich in ihrem geblümten Kattunkleide dasaß, las eine Erzählung, welche den Titel trug: »Blind, taub, stumm und dennoch glückselig«; zwischendurch schabte sie die Biskuitreste auf dem Tischtuche zusammen, worauf sie das Häufchen mit allen fünf Fingern ergriff und behutsam verzehrte.","The consul, his wife, Tony, Tom and Klothilde sat in a semicircle around the round laid table, on which the service used shimmered, while Christian, a little to one side, with an unhappy expression, prepared Cicero's second Catilinarian speech. The Consul was busy with his cigar and the ""advertisements."" The Consul had lowered her silk embroidery and smiled at little Klara, who was looking for violets with Ida Jungmann on the lawn, because there were sometimes violets there. Tony had his head in both hands and was reading Hoffmann's Serapionsbrüder while Tom very carefully tickled her neck with a blade of grass, which she didn't notice out of cleverness. And Klothilde, who sat there thin and elderly in her flowered calico dress, read a story entitled: ""Blind, deaf, dumb and yet blissful""; now and then she scraped up the remains of biscuits on the tablecloth, whereupon she grasped the heap with all five fingers and carefully ate it.","The sparkling coffee service was still on the table, around which they sat in a semicircle: the consul, his wife, Tony, Tom, and Klothilde—sour-faced Christian was a little off to one side, memorizing Cicero’s second oration against Catiline.

His wife had laid her embroidery in her lap and smiled now as she watched little Clara search the lawn for violets with Ida Jungmann, because now and then you could find them there. Her chin propped in both hands, Tony was reading Hoffmann’s Serapion Brethren, while Tom tickled the back of her neck very circumspectly with a blade of grass, which she wisely chose not to notice. And Klothilde, looking skinny and old-maidish in her flowery cotton frock, was reading a story entitled “Blind, Deaf, and Dumb—and Happy Nonetheless,” all the while scraping up cookie crumbs into little piles on the tablecloth, then transferring them carefully in a five-fingered grip to her mouth.","The Consul, his wife, Tony, Tom, and Clothilde sat in a half-circle around the table, which was laid with its usual shining service. Christian, sitting a little to one side, conned the second oration of Cicero against Catiline. He looked un-happy. The Consul smoked his cigar and read the Advertiser. His wife had let her embroidery fall into her lap and sat smiling at little Clara; the child, with Ida Jungmann, was looking for violets in the grass-plot. Tony, her head propped on both hands, was deep in Hoffman's ""Serapion Brethren,"" while Tom tickled her in the back of the neck with a grass-blade, an attention which she very wisely ignored.

"Es war Winter geworden, Weihnacht war vorüber, man schrieb Januar, Januar 1875. Der Schnee, der die Bürgersteige als eine festgetretene, mit Sand und Asche untermischte Masse bedeckte, lagerte zu beiden Seiten der Fahrdämme in hohen Haufen, die beständig grauer, zerklüfteter und poröser wurden, denn es waren Wärmegrade in der Luft. Das Pflaster war naß und schmutzig, und von den grauen Giebeln troff es.

"Ach, auch hierin gelangte er nicht zum Frieden. Dieser Mann mit seiner nagenden Sorge um die Ehre seines Hauses, um seine Frau, seinen Sohn, seinen Namen, seine Familie, dieser abgenutzte Mann, der seinen Körper mit Mühe und Kunst elegant, korrekt und aufrecht erhielt, er plagte sich mehrere Tage mit der Frage, wie es nun eigentlich bestellt sei: ob nun eigentlich die Seele unmittelbar nach dem Tode in den Himmel gelange, oder ob die Seligkeit erst mit der Auferstehung des Fleisches beginne … Und wo blieb die Seele bis dahin? Hatte ihn jemals jemand in der Schule oder der Kirche darüber belehrt?

And where did the soul go until then? Had anyone ever said anything about it at school or in church? How could they justify leaving people in such uncertainty?

"Plaudernd, befriedigt und in bester Laune Wünsche in betreff einer gesegneten Mahlzeit austauschend, verfügte man sich durch die große Flügeltür ins Landschaftszimmer zurück.

"»Ich sage natürlich nicht, daß Ihre liebe Frau Mutter wird morgen wieder spazierengehen können«, fuhr Doktor Grabow sanftmütig fort. »Diesen Eindruck wird die Patientin nicht auf Sie gemacht haben, lieber Senator. Es ist ja nicht zu leugnen, daß der Katarrh seit vierundzwanzig Stunden eine ärgerliche Wendung genommen hat. Der Schüttelfrost gestern abend gefiel mir nicht recht, und heute gibt es da nun wahrhaftig ein bißchen Seitenstechen und Kurzluftigkeit.

I did not like those chills yesterday evening, and today there is in fact a little pain in one side and a shortness of breath. And a light fever now, too—oh, insignificant, but fever nonetheless. In brief, my dear Senator, one must probably reconcile oneself with the pesky fact that the lung has been affected.” “The lung is affected?”","""I don't say,"" went on Dr. Grabuw, in his gentle voice, ""that your dear Mother will be walking out to-morrow. You can tell that by looking at her, of course. There is no denying that the inflammation has taken a disappointing turn in the last twenty-four hours. The chill yesterday afternoon did not 161 please me at all, and to-day there is actually pain in the side. And some fever--oh, nothing to speak of, hut still--In short, my dear Senator, we shall probably have to reckon with the troublesome fact that the lung is slightly affected."""
"Beim Aufgang zur zweiten Etage bildete der Korridor ein Knie, um sich nun in der Richtung der Saallänge bis zur Gesindetreppe hinzuziehen, bei der sich ein Nebeneingang zum Saale befand. Der Treppe zum zweiten Stockwerk gegenüber war die Öffnung zum Schacht der Winde, mit der die Speisen aus der Küche heraufbefördert wurden, und dabei stand an der Wand ein größerer Tisch, an welchem das Folgmädchen Silberzeug zu putzen pflegte.

"Christian seinerseits pflegte seinen neuen Verwandten mit gekrauster Nase zu beobachten und am nächsten Tage sein Benehmen und seine Sprechweise eingehend nachzuahmen. Der zweite Sohn des seligen Konsul Johann Buddenbrook war in Öynhausen von seinem Gelenkrheumatismus genesen; aber eine gewisse Steifheit der Glieder dauerte noch fort, und die periodische »Qual« in seiner linken Seite – dort, wo »alle Nerven zu kurz« waren – sowie die sonstigen Störungen, denen er sich ausgesetzt fühlte: Atmungs- und Schluckbeschwerden, Unregelmäßigkeiten des Herzens und Neigung zu Lähmungserscheinungen oder Furcht davor – waren keineswegs aus der Welt geschafft. Auch war sein Äußeres kaum dasjenige eines Mannes, der erst am Ende der Dreißiger steht. Sein Schädel war vollständig entblößt; nur am Hinterkopf und an den Schläfen stand noch ein wenig seines dünnen, rötlichen Haares, und seine kleinen, runden Augen, die mit unruhigem Ernste umherschweiften, lagen tiefer als jemals in ihren Höhlen. Gewaltiger aber auch und knochiger, als jemals, sprang seine große, gehöckerte Nase zwischen den hageren und fahlen Wangen hervor, über dem dichten, rotblonden Schnurrbart, der den Mund überhing … Und die Hose aus durablem und elegantem englischen Stoff umschlotterte seine dürren, gekrümmten Beine.","Christian, for his part, used to watch his new relative with a wrinkled nose, and the next day he would carefully imitate his behavior and way of speaking. The second son of the late Consul Johann Buddenbrook had recovered from his articular rheumatism in Öynhausen; but a certain stiffness of the limbs still persisted, and the periodic ""torment"" in his left side - where ""all the nerves were too short"" - as well as the other disturbances to which he felt exposed: trouble breathing and swallowing, irregularities of the Heart and tendency to paralysis or fear of it - were by no means eliminated. Also, his appearance was hardly that of a man only in his late thirties. His skull was completely bared; only a little of his thin, reddish hair remained on the back of his head and on his temples, and his small, round eyes, which wandered about with restless seriousness, lay deeper in their sockets than ever. But more powerful and bonier than ever, his large, humped nose jutted out between the gaunt and sallow cheeks, over the thick, reddish-blonde mustache that hung over his mouth... And the trousers, made of durable and elegant English fabric, hung around his scrawny, bent legs .","Christian, as was his habit, wrinkled his nose and watched his new relative, and the next day offered an exhaustive imitation of Hugo’s actions and speech. Consul Johann Buddenbrook’s younger son had recovered from his rheumatic fever in Oeynhausen, but a certain stiffness lingered in his limbs, and he was certainly not free of the periodic “ache” in his left side—where “all the nerves were too short”—or of any other of the ailments to which he felt himself disposed: difficulties in breathing and swallowing, irregular pulse, and a tendency to paralysis, or at least the fear of it. He hardly looked like a man in his late thirties. He was totally bald, with only a few thin, reddish hairs at his temples and across the back of his head; his small, round eyes, roving about restless and pensive, lay deeper than ever in their sockets. And his large, hooked nose was bonier than ever, jutting out even more prominently from between his gaunt, sallow cheeks and above his drooping reddish blond mustache. And his elegant trousers of durable English wool flapped around scrawny, bowed legs.","Christian, on the other hand, used to look at his new relative down his nose, and the next day imitate him and his con-versation with full details. The second son of the deceased Consul Buddenbrook had been relieved of his rheumatism in Dynhausen; but a certain stiffness of the joints was left, as well as the periodic misery in the left side, where all the nerves were too short, and sundry other ills to which he was heir, as difficulty in breathing and swallowing, irregularity of the heart action, and a tendency to paralysis--or at least to a fear of it. He did not look like a man at the end of the thirties. His head was entirely bald except for vestiges of reddish hair at the back of the neck and on the temples; and his small round roving eyes lay deeper than ever in their sockets. And his great bony nose and his lean, sallow cheeks were startlingly prominent above his heavy drooping red moustaches. His trousers, of beautiful and lasting English stuff, flapped about his crooked emaciated legs."
"Thomas war ganz allein dort drinnen; er saß an seinem Fensterplatz und schrieb einen Brief. Er blickte auf, indem er eine seiner hellen Brauen emporzog, und streckte seiner Schwester die Hand entgegen.","Thomas was in there all alone; he sat at his window seat and wrote a letter. He looked up, raising one of his fair brows, and held out his hand to his sister.","Thomas was sitting all alone, writing a letter at his desk beside the window.

"Am liebsten und längsten aber plauderte Tony, nach dem Mittagessen oder morgens beim ersten Frühstück, mit ihrem Vater. Ihr Verhältnis zu ihm war mit einem Schlage weit inniger geworden als früher. Sie hatte bislang, bei seiner Machtstellung in der Stadt, bei seiner emsigen, soliden, strengen und frommen Tüchtigkeit, mehr ängstliche Ehrfurcht als Zärtlichkeit für ihn empfunden; während jener Auseinandersetzung aber in ihrem Salon war er ihr menschlich nahegetreten, und es hatte sie mit Stolz und Rührung erfüllt, daß er sie eines vertrauten und ernsten Gespräches über diese Sache gewürdigt, daß er die Entscheidung ihr selbst anheim gestellt und daß er der Unantastbare, ihr fast mit Demut gestanden, er fühle sich nicht schuldlos ihr gegenüber. Es ist sicher, daß Tony selbst niemals auf diesen Gedanken gekommen wäre; da er es aber sagte, so glaubte sie es, und ihre Gefühle für ihn wurden weicher und zarter dadurch. Was den Konsul selbst anging, so änderte er seine Anschauungsweise nicht und glaubte seiner Tochter mit verdoppelter Liebe ihr schweres Geschick entgelten zu müssen.","But what Tony liked best and spent the longest time chatting with her father was after lunch or at breakfast in the morning. Her relationship to him suddenly became much more intimate than it had been before. Hitherto, given his position of power in the city, given his industrious, solid, strict, and pious efficiency, she had felt more anxious reverence than tenderness for him; but during that argument in her salon he had approached her as a human being, and it had filled her with pride and emotion that he had honored her with an intimate and serious conversation about this matter, that he had left the decision up to her and that he was the untouchable, confessed to her almost humbly that he didn't feel innocent towards her. It is certain that Tony himself would never have thought of it; but when he said it, she believed it, and her feelings for him became softer and more tender as a result. As for the Consul himself, he did not change his views and felt that he had to repay his daughter for her difficult fate with redoubled love.","But most of all Tony loved to chat with her father over dinner, or at breakfast early each morning. Her attachment to him had suddenly become much deeper than ever before. She had always been in awe of his powerful position in the town, of his diligent, sober, stern, and pious competence, had felt more respect than tenderness for him, but during the stormy scene in her salon, he had shown her his human side; it had touched her and filled her with pride that he had found her worthy of a serious, confidential discussion of the matter, that he had put the decision in her hands, and that he, who had always been so unimpeachable, had admitted almost humbly that he did not feel guiltless in what had happened to her. Certainly such a thought would never have occurred to Tony on her own; but since he had said it, she believed it, and her feelings for him had grown softer and tenderer. The consul’s view of the matter had not changed, either—in the wake of this terrible misfortune, he believed he owed his daughter twice as much love.","But it was with her father that Tony talked most and longest. She liked to catch him after the noonday meal or in the morning at early breakfast. Their relations had grown closer and warmer; for her feeling had been hereto-fore one of awe and respect rather than affection, on account of his high position in the town, his piety, his solid, stern ability and industry. During that talk in her own salon he had come humanly near to her, and it had filled her with pride and emotion to be found worthy of that serious and confidential consultation. He, the infallible parent, had put the decision into her hands: he had confessed, almost humbly, to a sense of guilt. Such an idea would never have entered Tony's head of itself; but since he said it, she believed it, and her feeling for him had thereby grown warmer and ten-derer. As for the Consul, he believed himself bound to make up to his daughter for her misfortune by redoubled love and care."
"Sein Eifer war groß bei solchen Gesprächen, und er ließ ihm freien Lauf, denn er fühlte sich zu Hause in diesem Salon. Jeden Mittwoch, am Nachmittage, erschien seine große, vierschrötige und ein wenig hochschultrige Gestalt, in einem kaffeebraunen Leibrock, dessen Schöße die Kniekehlen bedeckten, auf der Schwelle, und in Erwartung seiner Partnerin öffnete er liebevoll den Bechstein-Flügel, ordnete die Violinstimmen auf dem geschnitzten Stehpult und präludierte dann einen Augenblick leicht und kunstvoll, indem er seinen Kopf wohlgefällig von einer Schulter auf die andere sinken ließ.","His enthusiasm was great in such conversations, and he gave it free rein, because he felt at home in this salon. Every Wednesday afternoon, his tall, squat and slightly high-shouldered figure appeared on the threshold in a coffee-colored tunic whose skirts covered the backs of his knees, and in anticipation of his partner he lovingly opened the Bechstein grand piano, arranged the violin parts on the carved standing desk, and then preluded for a moment, lightly and artfully, letting his head loll complacently from one shoulder to the other.","He was passionate about such matters, and he gave his passion free rein, for he felt quite at home here in the salon. Every Wednesday afternoon, this large, square-built man, who carried his shoulders a little too high, would appear on the threshold in his coffee-brown swallowtail coat that fell below the hollows of his knees, and as he waited for his musical partner he would lovingly open the Bechstein grand piano, arrange the violin parts on the carved music stand, and play a brief, light, tasteful prelude, resting his head contentedly first on one shoulder, then the other.","His zeal as he spoke was great, and he gave it free rein, for he felt at home in the house. Every Wednesday after-noon there appeared on the threshold his bulky, square, high-shouldered figure, in a coffee-coloured coat, whereof the skirts hung down over his knees.

Dann jedoch, ganz überraschend, als ob die Aufständischen selbst über ihr Betragen erschrocken gewesen wären, ward es draußen ebenso still wie im Saale, und in der tiefen Lautlosigkeit, die sich über das Ganze legte, ward lediglich in der Gegend der untersten Sitzreihen, wo Lebrecht Kröger sich niedergelassen hatte, ein Wort vernehmbar, das kalt, langsam und nachdrücklich sich dem Schweigen entrang: »Die Canaille!«","Suddenly the noise outside increased... The revolution had arrived under the windows of the courtroom! In one fell swoop the excited expressions of opinion fell silent in here. Silent with horror, they clasped their hands on their stomachs and looked at each other's faces or at the windows, behind which fists were raised and exuberant, nonsensical and deafening howls filled the air. But then, quite surprisingly, as if the insurgents themselves had been shocked by their behavior, it became just as quiet outside as in the hall, and in the deep silence that settled over the whole thing, it was only in the area of the lowest rows of seats where Lebrecht Kröger had sat down, a word audible that cold, slow and emphatic broke the silence: ""The canaille!""","There was a sudden surge in the tumult outside—the revolution had reached the windows of the assembly hall. The excited exchange of opinions inside stopped short. Hands folded over their stomachs and, mute with shock, they stared at one another or toward the windows, where they could see raised fists and hear boisterous hoots, inane and deafening yowls that filled the air. But then, quite unexpectedly, as if the rebels were suddenly appalled at their own behavior, it was as quiet outside as it was in the hall; and the deep hush that fell over everything was broken only by the sound of one word, spoken slowly and with cold intensity, emanating from somewhere in the bottom rows, where Lebrecht Kröger had taken his seat: “Rabble!”","All of a sudden the tumult began outside. Revolution had arrived under the windows of the Sitting. The excited ex-change of opinions inside ceased simultaneously. Every man, dumb with the shock, folded his hands upon his stomach and looked at his fellows or at the windows, where fists were being shaken in the air and the crowd was giving vent to deafening and frantic yelling. But then, most astonishingly, as though the offenders themselves had suddenly grown aghast at their own behaviour, it became just as still outside as in the hall; and in that deep hush, one word from the neigh-bourhood of the lowest benches, where Lebrecht Kroger was sitting, was distinctly audible. It rang through the hall, cold, emphatic, and deliberate--the word ""Canaille!"""

"O Gott, wie habe ich mich geärgert! Beifolgenden Brief und Ring erhielt ich soeben von Gr., so daß ich Kopfweh vor Aufregung habe, und weiß ich nichts Besseres zu tun, als beides an Dich zurückgehen zu lassen. Gr. will mich nicht verstehen, und ist das, was er so poetisch von dem ›Versprechen‹ schreibt, einfach nicht der Fall, und bitte ich Dich so dringend, ihm nun doch kurzerhand plausibel zu machen, daß ich jetzt noch tausendmal weniger als vor sechs Wochen in der Lage bin, ihm mein Jawort fürs Leben zu erteilen und daß er mich endlich in Frieden lassen soll, er macht sich ja lächerlich. Dir, dem besten Vater, kann ich es ja sagen, daß ich anderweitig gebunden bin an jemanden, der mich liebt, und den ich liebe, daß es sich gar nicht sagen läßt. O Papa! Darüber könnte ich viele Bogen vollschreiben, ich spreche von Herrn Morten Schwarzkopf, der Arzt werden will, und, sowie er Doktor ist, um meine Hand anhalten will.

I am speaking of Morten Schwarzkopf, who intends to become a doctor and, as soon as he is one, to ask for my hand. I know that by family custom I should marry a merchant, but as a scholar Morten is an equally respectable gentleman. He is not wealthy, something I know is important for you and Mama, and I may be young, but I do know one thing, dear Papa: that life has taught many people that riches do not always make for happiness.

He makes himself ridiculous. To you, my dearest Father, I can say that I have bound myself elsewhere, to one who adores me and whom I love more than I can say. Dh, Papa! I could write pages to you! I mean Herr Morten Schwarzkopf, who is studying to be a physician, and who as BUDDENBRODKS soon as that happens will ask for my hand. I know that it is the rule of the family to marry a business man, but Morten belongs to the other section of respectable men, the scholars.

"Der Name, den Kai ihm gegeben hatte, wurde nur von ihm selbst und Hanno Buddenbrook gebraucht, und sie hüteten sich, ihn vor den Kameraden laut werden zu lassen, aus Scheu vor dem starren und kalten Blick des Unverständnisses, den sie so wohl kannten … Nein, es gab nicht einen Punkt, in dem diese beiden sich mit ihren Genossen verstanden. Es war ihnen sogar die Art von Opposition und Rache fremd, an der die anderen sich genügen ließen, und sie mißachteten die üblichen Spottnamen, weil ein Humor daraus sprach, der sie nicht berührte und sie nicht einmal zum Lächeln brachte. Es war so billig, so nüchtern und unwitzig, den dünnen Professor Hückopp »die Spinne« und Oberlehrer Ballerstedt »Kakadu« zu nennen, eine so armselige Schadloshaltung für den Zwang des Staatsdienstes! Nein, Kai Graf Mölln war ein wenig bissiger! Für seine und Hannos Person hatte er den Brauch eingeführt, von den Lehrern nur vermittels ihres richtigen bürgerlichen Namens unter Hinzufügung des Wortes »Herr« zu sprechen: »Herr Ballerstedt«, »Herr Mantelsack«, »Herr Hückopp« … Das ergab gleichsam eine ablehnende und ironische Kälte, eine spöttische Distanz und Fremdheit … Sie sprachen von dem »Lehrkörper« und amüsierten sich während ganzer Pausen damit, sich ein wirklich vorhandenes Geschöpf, eine Art Ungeheuer von widerlicher und phantastischer Gestaltung darunter vorzustellen. Und sie sprachen im allgemeinen von der »Anstalt« mit einer Betonung, als handele es sich um eine solche wie die, in der Hannos Onkel Christian sich aufhielt …","The name that Kai had given him was used only by himself and Hanno Buddenbrook, and they were careful not to let it be spoken to their comrades, for fear of the cold, stare of incomprehension that they knew so well... No, there wasn't a point where these two got along with their comrades. Foreign to them even the kind of opposition and revenge to which the others were content, and they disregarded the usual nicknames because there was a humor in them that did not touch them and did not even make them smile. It was so cheap, so matter-of-fact and silly to call the thin Professor Hückopp ""the spider"" and Head Teacher Ballerstedt ""cockatoo,"" such a pathetic indemnification for the compulsion of civil service! No, Kai Graf Mölln was a little more snappy! For himself and Hanno, he had introduced the custom of only referring to the teachers by their real civil names with the addition of the word “Herr”: “Herr Ballerstedt”, “Herr Mantelsack”, “Herr Hückopp” … This resulted in a rejection, so to speak and ironic coldness, a mocking detachment and strangeness... They spoke of the ""teaching body"" and amused themselves during whole pauses by imagining a real existing creature, a kind of monster of a disgusting and fantastic design underneath. And they generally spoke of the ""institute"" with an emphasis as if it were something like the one where Hanno's uncle Christian was...","Kai Mölln and Hanno Buddenbrook used Kai’s nickname for him only between themselves and were careful never to let their schoolmates overhear it—out of an aversion to that fixed, cold look of incomprehension that they knew so well. No, these two boys had nothing whatever in common with their fellow students, who were content with simple revenge or obstinacy. That was not their way. They despised the usual nicknames given the teachers, because these were based on a humor that left them cold, didn’t even make them smile. It was so cheap, so prosaic, so unfunny to call skinny Professor Hückopp “the spider,” or Ballerstedt “the cockatoo”—poor compensation for their own compulsory service to the state. No, Kai Mölln could be a little more cutting than that! He had introduced the practice, just for himself and Hanno, of calling teachers by their proper last names, but with the addition of the word “Herr”: “Herr Ballerstedt,” “Herr Mantelsack,” “Herr Hückopp”—and it added, as it were, the right ironic, dismissive coolness of tone, a mocking, quirky condescension. They spoke of the “pedagogic body” and could amuse themselves during an entire break between classes by picturing a kind of huge, fantastic, repulsive monster. And they usually spoke of “the institution,” in a tone that implied it was much like the one in which Hanno’s Uncle Christian resided.","The name Kai had given Dr. Wulicke was known only to himself and Hanno, and they took the greatest pains not to let any of the others overhear it, for they could not possibly understand. No, there was not one single point on which those two stood on common ground with their schoolfellows. Even the methods of revenge, of ""getting even,"" which ob-tained in the school were foreign to Hanno and Kai; and they utterly distained the current nicknames, which did not in the least appeal to their more subtle sense of humour. It was so poor, it showed such a paucity of invention, to call thin Professor Hiickopp ""Spider"" and Herr Ballerstedt ""Cocky. "" It was such scant compensation for their com-pulsory service to the state! No, Kai, Count Molln, flattered himself that he was not so feeble as that! He invented, for his own and Hanno's use, a method of alluding to all their masters by their actual names, with the simple prefix, thus: Herr Ballerstedt, Herr Hiickopp. The irony of this, its chilly remoteness and mockery, pleased him very much. He liked to speak of the ""teaching body""; and would amuse himself for whole recesses with imagining it as an actual creature, a sort of monster, with a repulsively fantastic form.

"»Dazu Kleider und Schuhe«, sprach sie, »Essen und Trinken, Haus und Hof, Weib und Kind, Acker und Vieh …« Bei diesen Worten aber brach der alte M. Johann Buddenbrook einfach in Gelächter aus, in sein helles, verkniffenes Kichern, das er heimlich in Bereitschaft gehalten hatte. Er lachte vor Vergnügen, sich über den Katechismus mokieren zu können, und hatte wahrscheinlich nur zu diesem Zwecke das kleine Examen vorgenommen. Er erkundigte sich nach Tonys Acker und Vieh, fragte, wieviel sie für den Sack Weizen nähme und erbot sich, Geschäfte mit ihr zu machen. Sein rundes, rosig überhauchtes und wohlmeinendes Gesicht, dem er beim besten Willen keinen Ausdruck von Bosheit zu geben vermochte, wurde von schneeweiß gepudertem Haar eingerahmt, und etwas wie ein ganz leise angedeutetes Zöpflein fiel auf den breiten Kragen seines mausgrauen Rockes hinab. Er war, mit seinen siebenzig Jahren, der Mode seiner Jugend nicht untreu geworden; nur auf den Tressenbesatz zwischen den Knöpfen und den großen Taschen hatte er verzichtet, aber niemals im Leben hatte er lange Beinkleider getragen.

He laughed with delight at being able to make fun of the catechism, and had probably taken the little exam for that purpose only. He inquired about Tony's field and cattle, asked how much she took for the sack of wheat, and offered to do business with her. His round, rosy and well-meaning face, which he could not give an expression of malice with the best will in the world, was framed by snow-white powdered hair, and something like a very faintly hinted little pigtail fell down on the wide collar of his mouse-grey coat. At seventy he had not strayed from the fashion of his youth; the only thing he had done without was the lace trimmings between the buttons and the large pockets, but he had never worn long trousers in his life. His chin rested broad, doubled and with an expression of comfort on the white lace jabot.","“Including clothes and shoes,” she said, “meat and drink, hearth and home, wife and child, fields and cattle …” But at these words, old Monsieur Johann Buddenbrook burst into laughter, a high, pinched giggle that he had secretly kept at the ready.

He inquired about Tony’s fields and cattle, asked how much she wanted for a sack of wheat, and offered her a contract.

He had probably put the child through this little examination with no other end in view. He inquired after Tony's acre and cow, asked how much she wanted for a sack of wheat, and tried to drive a bargain with her. His round, rosy, benevolent face, which never would look cross no matter how hard he tried, was set in a frame of snow-white powdered hair, and the suggestion of a pigtail fell over the broad collar of his mouse-coloured coat. His double chin rested comfortably on a white lace frill. He still, in his seventies, adhered to the fashions of his youth: only the lace frogs and the big pockets were missing. And never in all his life had he worn a pair of trousers."

"Er dachte daran nicht oder ging, seiner Art gemäß, nach einem Augenblick seltsam unruhigen Nachdenkens darüber hinweg. Sein Bruder, der Konsul, aber wußte es; er wußte, daß Christian den Widersachern der Familie einen Angriffspunkt bot, und … es waren der Angriffspunkte bereits zu viele. Die Verwandtschaft mit den Överdiecks war weitläufig und würde nach dem Tode des Bürgermeisters ganz wertlos sein. Die Krögers spielten gar keine Rolle mehr, lebten zurückgezogen und hatten arge Geschichten mit ihrem Sohne … Des seligen Onkel Gotthold Mißheirat blieb etwas Unangenehmes … Des Konsuls Schwester war eine geschiedene Frau, wenn man auch die Hoffnung auf ihre Wiedervermählung nicht fahren zu lassen brauchte – und sein Bruder sollte ein lächerlicher Mensch sein, durch dessen Clownerien sich tätige Herren mit wohlwollendem oder höhnischem Lachen die Mußestunden ausfüllen ließen, der zu alledem Schulden machte und am Ende des Quartals, wenn er kein Geld mehr hatte, sich ganz offenkundig von Doktor Gieseke freihalten ließ … eine unmittelbare Blamage der Firma.","He didn't think about it, or, in his own way, dismissed it after a moment of oddly restless reflection. His brother the consul, however, knew; he knew that Christian offered the family's adversaries a point of attack, and ... there were already too many points of attack. The kinship with the Överdiecks was distant and would be worthless after the mayor's death. The Krögers no longer played any role, lived a secluded life and had nasty affairs with their son... The late Uncle Gotthold's mismarriage remained something unpleasant... The Consul's sister was a divorced woman, even if one did not have to give up hope of her remarriage - and his brother was supposed to be a ridiculous man, whose clowning made active gentlemen fill their leisure hours with benevolent or scornful laughter, who, on top of everything else, incurred debts and at the end of the quarter, when he had no more money, quite obviously let Doctor Gieseke hold him free … an immediate embarrassment for the company.","He paid no attention to it, or in his usual fashion he would shrug it off after a curiously anxious moment of thinking things over. His brother the consul, however, knew—he knew that Christian offered the family’s adversaries an easy target, and that this was one target too many. Their relation to the Oeverdiecks was a distant one and would be quite useless after the mayor’s death. The Krögers no longer played any role at all; they lived in seclusion and continued to have dreadful troubles with their son. Late Uncle Gotthold’s bad marriage remained an embarrassment. The consul’s sister was a divorced woman, even if one need not give up all hope that she might marry again. And his brother was considered a ridiculous fool. Busy men whiled away their leisure hours over his buffoonery, laughed at him—out of pity or scorn. He ran up far too many debts; and when he was out of money before the end of each quarter, he quite flagrantly let Andreas Gieseke pay his bills—a direct slap in the firm’s face.","He thought little or nothing of this. If he noticed it, it passed out of his mind again after a momentary disquiet. But his brother the Consul knew it. Thomas knew that Christian afforded a point of attack to the enemies of the family--and there were already too many such points. The connection 313 B U D D E N B R 0 0 K S with the Overdiecks was distant and would be quite worthless 'after the Burgomaster's death. The Krbgers played no role now; they lived retired, after the misfortunes with their son. The marriage of the deceased uncle Gotthold was always un-pleasant. The Consul's sister was a divorced wife, even if one did not quite give up hope of her re-marrying. And his brother was a laughing-stock in the town, a man with whose clownishness industrious men amused their leisure and then laughed good-naturedly or maliciously. He contracted debts, too, and at the end of the quarter, when he had no more money, would quite openly let Dr. Gieseke pay for him--which was a direct reflection on the firm."

Die starken und elastischen Tapeten, die von den Mauern durch einen leeren Raum getrennt waren, zeigten umfangreiche Landschaften, zartfarbig wie der dünne Teppich, der den Fußboden bedeckte, Idylle im Geschmack des 18. Jahrhunderts, mit fröhlichen Winzern, emsigen Ackersleuten, nett bebänderten Schäferinnen, die reinliche Lämmer am Rande spiegelnden Wassers im Schoße hielten oder sich mit zärtlichen Schäfern küßten … Ein gelblicher Sonnenuntergang herrschte meistens auf diesen Bildern, mit dem der gelbe Überzug der weiß lackierten Möbel und die gelbseidenen Gardinen vor den beiden Fenstern übereinstimmten.","They sat in the ""landscape room"" on the first floor of the spacious old house on Mengstrasse, which the Johann Buddenbrook firm had bought some time ago and which the family had not lived in for long.

A yellowish sunset mostly dominated these pictures, with which the yellow coating of the white lacquered furniture and the yellow silk curtains in front of the two windows corresponded.","They were sitting in the “landscape room,” on the second floor of the spacious old house on Meng Strasse, which the firm of Johann Buddenbrook had recently purchased and in which his family had resided for only a short time. The thick, supple wall coverings, which had been hung so that there was a gap between them and the wall, depicted expansive landscapes in the same pastel colors as the thin carpet on the floor—idyllic scenes in the style of the eighteenth century, with merry vinedressers, diligent farmers, prettily ribboned shepherdesses, who sat beside reflecting pools, holding spotless lambs in their laps or exchanging kisses with tender shepherds. Most of these scenes were suffused with yellowish sunsets that matched the yellow upholstery of the white enameled furniture and the yellow silk of the curtains at both windows.","They were sitting in the ""landscape-room"" on the first floor of the rambling old house in Meng Street, which the firm of Johann Buddenbrook had acquired some time since, though the family had not lived in it long.

"»Wie haben wir das eigentlich gemacht?« fuhr Herr Kesselmeyer fort. »Wie haben wir es eigentlich angefangen, das Töchterchen und die achtzigtausend Mark zu ergattern? O-ho! das arrangiert sich! Wenn man auch nur für einen Sechsling Regsamkeit und Findigkeit besitzt, so arrangiert sich das!

"Er verstand sie, er verstand, was sie sagte. Aber er vermochte ihr mit dem Gefühl nicht zu folgen und nicht zu begreifen, warum Melodien, die ihn ermunterten oder rührten, null und nichtig sein – und Musikstücke, die ihn herb und verworren anmuteten, den höchsten musikalischen Wert besitzen sollten.

"Nach Travemünde geht es immer geradeaus, mit der Fähre übers Wasser und dann wieder geradeaus; der Weg war beiden wohlbekannt. Die graue Chaussee glitt flink unter den hohl und taktmäßig aufschlagenden Hufen von Lebrecht Krögers dicken Braunen aus Mecklenburg dahin, obgleich die Sonne brannte und der Staub die spärliche Aussicht verhüllte. Man hatte ausnahmsweise um 1 Uhr zu Mittag gegessen, und die Geschwister waren punkt 2 Uhr abgefahren, so würden sie kurz nach 4 Uhr anlangen, denn wenn eine Droschke drei Stunden gebraucht, so hatte der Krögersche Jochen Ehrgeiz genug, den Weg in zweien zu machen.","After Travemünde it goes straight ahead, with the ferry across the water and then straight ahead again; the way was well known to both. The gray road slid nimbly under the hollow, rhythmic hoofbeats of Lebrecht Kroeger's fat bay horse from Mecklenburg, although the sun was beating down and the dust obscured the sparse view. As an exception, lunch had been eaten at 1 a.m., and the siblings had left at 2 a.m. sharp, so they would arrive shortly after 4 a.m., because if a cab takes three hours, Krögersche Jochen was ambitious enough to make the journey in two .","THE ROAD TO TRAVEMÜNDE goes straight ahead, then comes a ferry, and then it’s straight ahead again—they both knew the way well. The gray road glided swiftly along as the hoofs of Lebrecht Kröger’s massive Mecklenburg bays rang out hollow and regular, but the sun burned hot and the unexciting landscape was veiled in dust. They had eaten an early dinner at one o’clock and had departed at two on the dot, which meant they would arrive shortly after four—because, if a trip took four hours in a hired carriage, the Krögers’ driver, Jochen, made a point of doing it in two.","THE road to Travem� nde first crosses the ferry and then goes straight ahead. The grey high-road glided away under the hoofs of Lebrecht Kr�ger's fat brown Mecklenburgs. The sound of their trotting was hollow and rhythmical, the sun burned hot, and dust concealed the meagre view. The family had eaten at one o'clock, an hour earlier than usual, and the brother and sister set out punctually at two. They would arrive shortly after four; for what a hired carriage could do in three hours, the Kr�ger pair were mettlesome enough to make in two."
"Frau Permaneder hatte rasch die Lage überblickt und abgeschätzt. Sie sprach sich gegen die Konsulin und den Senator offen darüber aus. Es war klar, daß die Interessen sich entgegenkamen und sich ergänzten. Direktor Weinschenk war, wie Erika, ohne jegliche gesellschaftliche Verbindung; die beiden waren geradezu aufeinander angewiesen und von Gott ersichtlich füreinander bestimmt. Wollte der Direktor, der sich den Vierzig näherte, und dessen Haupthaar sich zu melieren begann, einen Hausstand gründen, was seiner Stellung zukam und seinen Verhältnissen entsprach, so eröffnete ihm die Verbindung mit Erika Grünlich den Eintritt in eine der ersten Familien der Stadt und war geeignet, ihn in seinem Berufe zu fördern, in seiner Position zu befestigen. Was aber Erikas Wohlfahrt betraf, so durfte Frau Permaneder sich sagen, daß wenigstens ihre eigenen Schicksale in diesem Falle ausgeschlossen seien. Mit Herrn Permaneder wies Hugo Weinschenk nicht die geringste Ähnlichkeit auf, und von Bendix Grünlich unterschied er sich durch seine Eigenschaft als solid situierter Beamter mit festem Gehalt, die eine weitere Karriere nicht ausschloß.","Mrs. Permaneder quickly surveyed and assessed the situation. She spoke openly to the consul and the senator about it. It was clear that the interests met and complemented each other. Director Weinschenk, like Erika, was without any social connections; the two were downright dependent on one another and evidently destined for one another by God. If the director, who was approaching forty and whose hair was beginning to streak, wanted to set up a household, which suited his position and his circumstances, the connection with Erika Grünlich enabled him to enter one of the top families in the city and was suitable to promote him in his profession, to secure him in his position. But as far as Erika's welfare was concerned, Frau Permaneder could say to herself that at least her own fate was excluded in this case. Hugo Weinschenk did not bear the slightest resemblance to Herr Permaneder, and he differed from Bendix Grünlich in his quality as a solidly situated civil servant with a fixed salary, which did not rule out a further career.","Frau Permaneder quickly reviewed the situation and arrived at an assessment. She spoke openly to her mother and brother about it. It was clear that here was a meeting of interests that complemented one another. Like Erika, Herr Weinschenk had no social connections whatever; the two were meant for one another, were a match obviously made in heaven. If the director, who was nearing forty and whose hair was already flecked with gray, wished to establish a family, something quite appropriate to his position and means, the connection with Erika Grünlich would provide him an opening into one of the first families in town, securing him in his job and advancing his career. As to her daughter’s welfare, Frau Permaneder felt confident in saying that at least there was no chance of Erika’s meeting her own fate. Herr Weinschenk bore not the least resemblance to Herr Permaneder, and, in contrast to Bendix Grünlich, Hugo Weinschenk was a man with a steady job and a good salary, which by no means precluded a further career.","Frau Permaneder quickly looked him over and summed him up. She talked freely with her mother and the Senator. It was clear to her that here was a case of two interests meeting and complementing each other. Director Weinschenk was, like Erica, devoid of every social connection : the two were thus, in a manner, marked out for each other--it was plainly the hand of God himself. If the Director, who was nearing the forties, his hair already sprinkled with grey, desired to found a family appropriate to his station and connections, here was an opening for him into one of the best circles in town, calculated to advance him in his calling and consolidate his position. As for Erica's welfare, Frau Permaneder could feel confident that at least her own lot would be out of the question. Herr Weinschenk had not the faintest resemblance to Herr Permaneder; and he was dif-ferentiated frnm Bendix Gr�nlich by his position as an oldestablished official with a fixed salary--which, of course, did not preclude a further career."

"Die Sache war die, daß Kai sich mit Schreiben abgab. Dies war es auch, was er heute morgen gemeint hatte, als er sagte, er habe besseres zu tun, als Schularbeiten zu machen, und Hanno hatte ihn wohl verstanden. Aus der Neigung zum Geschichtenerzählen, die er als kleiner Junge an den Tag gelegt hatte, hatten sich schriftstellerische Versuche entwickelt, und kürzlich hatte er eine Dichtung vollendet, ein Märchen, ein rücksichtslos phantastisches Abenteuer, in dem alles in einem dunklen Schein erglühte, das unter Metallen und geheimnisvollen Gluten in den tiefsten und heiligsten Werkstätten der Erde und zugleich in denen der menschlichen Seele spielte, und in dem die Urgewalten der Natur und der Seele auf eine sonderbare Art vermischt, gewandt, gewandelt und geläutert wurden, – geschrieben in einer innerlichen, deutsamen, ein wenig überschwenglichen und sehnsüchtigen Sprache von zarter Leidenschaftlichkeit …","The thing was that Kai busied himself with writing. That was also what he meant this morning when he said he had better things to do than doing schoolwork, and Hanno must have understood him. From the love of storytelling he had shown as a young boy, attempts at writing had developed, and recently he had completed a poem, a fairy tale, a ruthlessly fantastic adventure in which everything glowed in a dark glow that lay beneath metals and mysterious embers in the deepest and holiest workshops on earth and at the same time in those of the human soul, and in which the elemental forces of nature and the soul were mixed, turned, transformed and purified in a strange way - written in an inner, meaningful, a little exuberant and longing language of tender passion ...","The fact was that Kai was trying his hand at writing. That was what he had meant earlier that morning when he said that he had better things than homework to do, and Hanno had understood him well enough. His love of telling stories, so evident when he was a small boy, had continued to grow, and he was trying to become a writer. He had recently finished a piece, a fairy tale, a mad, fantastic tale of adventure, in which everything was bathed in an eerie light; it was set deep within the earth’s most sacred workshops, where ores and mysterious embers glowed, but at the same time within the human soul, so that in some strange way the primal forces of nature and of man’s soul were blended, altered, transformed, and refined—and all of it in a fervent, suggestive, and slightly extravagant language filled with delicate, passionate yearning.","Kai was absorbed in his writing. It was to this he had referred when he said that he had something better to do than his preparation, and Hanno had understood him. Attempts at composition had developed out of his old pro-pensity for inventing tales; and he had lately completed a composition in the form of a fantastic fairy tale, a narra-tive of symbolic adventure, which went forward in the depths of the earth among glowing metals and mysterious iires, and at the same time in the souls of men: a tale in which the primeval forces of nature and of the soul were interchanged and mingled, transformed and refined--the whole conceived and written in a vein of extravagant and even sentimental symbolism, fervid with passion and longing."

"Als Konsul Buddenbrook mit Siegismund Gosch in die Versammlung zurückkehrte, bot der Saal ein behaglicheres Bild als vor einer Viertelstunde. Er war von zwei großen Paraffinlampen erleuchtet, die auf dem Wortführertisch standen, und in ihrem gelben Licht saßen und standen die Herren beieinander, gossen sich Flaschenbier in blanke Seidel, stießen an und plauderten geräuschvoll in fröhlichster Stimmung. Frau Suerkringel, die Witwe Suerkringel war dagewesen, sie hatte sich treuherzig ihrer eingeschlossenen Gäste angenommen, mit beredten Worten, da die Belagerung ja noch lange dauern könne, eine kleine Stärkung in Vorschlag gebracht und sich die erregten Zeiten zunutze gemacht, um eine bedeutende Quantität ihres hellen und ziemlich spirituösen Bieres abzusetzen. Soeben, beim Wiedereintritt der beiden Unterhändler, schleppte der Hausknecht in Hemdärmeln und mit wohlmeinendem Lächeln einen neuen Vorrat von Flaschen herbei, und obgleich der Abend vorgeschritten, obgleich es zu spät war, der Verfassungsrevision noch Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken, war niemand geneigt, schon jetzt dies Beisammensein zu unterbrechen und nach Hause zu gehen.

It was lit by two large paraffin lamps that stood on the spokesman's table, and in their yellow light the gentlemen sat and stood together, poured bottled beer into shiny mugs, clinked glasses and chatted noisily in the happiest mood. Frau Suerkringel, the widow Suerkringel, had been there, she had honestly taken care of her trapped guests, eloquently, since the siege could last a long time, suggested a little refreshment and made use of the excited times to buy a significant quantity of her light and fairly spirited beer. Just as the two negotiators re-entered, the porter, in his shirtsleeves and with a benevolent smile, was carrying a fresh stock of bottles, and although the evening was late, although it was too late to pay any attention to the constitutional revision, no one was inclined to do so just yet interrupt the get-together and go home.

"Der Konsul blätterte hin und her im Hefte. Er las, ganz hinten, die kleinen Geschichten seiner eigenen Kinder, wann Tom die Masern und Antonie die Gelbsucht gehabt und Christian die Windpocken überstanden hatte; er las von den verschiedenen Reisen nach Paris, der Schweiz und Marienbad, die er mit seiner Gattin unternommen, und schlug zurück bis zu den pergamentartigen, eingerissenen, gelbgesprenkelten Blättern, die der alte Johann Buddenbrook, der Vater des Vaters, mit blaßgrauer Tinte in weitläufigen Schnörkeln beschrieben hatte. Diese Aufzeichnungen begannen mit einer weitläufigen Genealogie, welche die Hauptlinie verfolgte. Wie am Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts ein Buddenbrook, der älteste, der bekannt, in Parchim gelebt, und sein Sohn zu Grabau Ratsherr geworden sei. Wie ein fernerer Buddenbrook, Gewandschneider seines Zeichens, zu Rostock geheiratet, »sich sehr gut gestanden« – was unterstrichen war – und eine ungemeine Menge von Kindern gezeugt habe, tote und lebendige, wie es gerade kam … Wie wiederum einer, der schon Johan geheißen, als Kaufmann zu Rostock verblieben, und wie schließlich, am Ende und nach manchem Jahr, des Konsuls Großvater hierhergekommen sei und die Getreidefirma gegründet habe. Von diesem Vorfahren waren schon alle Daten bekannt: Wann er die Frieseln und wann die echten Blattern gehabt, war treu verzeichnet; wann er vom dritten Boden auf die Darre gestürzt und am Leben geblieben, obgleich eine Menge Balken im Wege gewesen seien, und wann er in ein hitzig Fieber mit Raserei verfallen, stand reinlich vermerkt. Und er hatte seinen Notizen manche gute Ermahnung an seine Nachkommen hinzugefügt, von denen, sorgfältig in hoher gotischer Schrift gemalt und umrahmt, der Satz hervorstach: »Mein Sohn, sey mit Lust bey den Geschäften am Tage, aber mache nur solche, daß wir bey Nacht ruhig schlafen können.« Und dann war umständlich nachgewiesen, daß ihm die alte, zu Wittenberg gedruckte Bibel zugehöre, und daß sie auf seinen Erstgeborenen und wiederum auf dessen Ältesten übergehen solle …","The Consul leafed back and forth in the notebook. At the back he read the little stories of his own children, when Tom had had the measles and Antonie had the jaundice and Christian had gotten over the chicken pox; he read of the various trips he made with his wife to Paris, Switzerland, and Marienbad, and turned back to the parchment-like, torn, yellow-speckled leaves that old Johann Buddenbrook, father's father, had written in expansive had described flourishes. These records began with an extensive genealogy tracing the main lineage. How at the end of the 16th century a Buddenbrook, the oldest known one, lived in Parchim and his son became a councilor at Grabau. How another Buddenbrook, tailor of his trade, got married in Rostock, ""did himself very well"" - which was underlined - and fathered an enormous number of children, dead and alive, as the case may be ... Like another one who was already called Johan , remained in Rostock as a merchant, and how finally, at the end and after many a year, the consul's grandfather came here and founded the grain company. All the dates of this ancestor were already known: when he had the tickling and when the real smallpox was faithfully recorded; when he fell from the third floor onto the kiln and survived, although a number of beams had been in the way, and when he fell into a violent fever with rage was neatly noted. And he had added to his notes many good admonitions to his descendants, of which the following sentence, carefully painted and framed in high Gothic script, stood out: ""My son, take pleasure in the business of the day, but only do such that we by And then it was cumbersomely proven that the old Bible printed in Wittenberg belonged to him and that it was to be passed on to his firstborn and in turn to his eldest...","The consul paged back and forth in the notebook. He read, at the very end, the little entries about his own children, when Tom had had the measles and Antonie, jaundice, and how Christian had survived chickenpox; he read about the various trips to Paris, Switzerland, and Marienbad that he and his wife had taken, and then opened to the torn and foxed parchment pages that old Johann Buddenbrook, his father’s father, had filled with elaborate curlicues executed in pale gray ink. These entries began with an extensive genealogy, tracing the family’s main line—how at the end of the sixteenth century the oldest known Buddenbrook had lived in Parchim and his son had become an alderman in Grabau. How, later, another Buddenbrook, a merchant tailor by trade, had married a woman from Rostock, “had done very well”—this was underlined—and sired a remarkable number of children, some of whom, as fate would have it, lived, others of whom did not. And how another, who called himself Johan, had remained in Rostock as a merchant. And finally how after many years the consul’s grandfather had arrived here to found their grain business. Dates were known and recorded for this ancestor: duly entered were the dates when he had a case of boils and when he had genuine pox; there were tidy entries for when he had fallen from the fourth story onto the drying-room floor, and lived to tell of it, although he struck a great many beams on the way down, and for when he had been delirious with a high fever. And he had added many a fine exhortation for his descendants, one sentence of which stood out because it was carefully framed and executed in tall Gothic script: “My son, show zeal for each day’s affairs of business, but only for such that make for a peaceful night’s sleep.” And then came an elaborate proof that the old Wittenberg Bible was indeed his, and that it should be passed on to his firstborn and from him to his eldest son.","The Consul went on turning over the pages. There at the end were written the small histories of his own children: how Tom had had the measles, and Antonie jaundice, and Christian chicken-pox. There were accounts of various jour-neys he had taken with his wife, to Paris, Switzerland, 53 Marienhad. Then the Consul turned back to the front of the book, to some pages written in bluish ink, in a hand full of flourishes, on paper that was like parchment, but tattered and spotted with age. Here his grandfather Johann had set down the genealogy of the main branch of the Buddenbrooks. At the end of the sixteenth century, the first Buddenbrook of whom they had knowledge lived in Parchirn, and his son had been a Senator of Grabau. Another Buddenbrook, a tailor by trade, and ""very well-to-do"" (this was underlined) had married in Rostock and begotten an extraordinary number of children, who lived or died, as the case might be. And again, another, this time a Johann, had lived in Rostock as a merchant, from whom the Consul's grandfather had descended, who had left Rostock to settle himself in this very town, and was the founder of the present grain business. There was much about him set down in detail: when he had had the purples, and when genuine small-pox; when he had fallen out of the malt-kiln and been miraculously saved, when he might have fallen against the beams and been crushed; how he had had fever and been delirious--all these events were meticu-lously described. He had also written down wise admonitions for the benefit of his descendants, like the following, which was carefully painted and framed, in a tall Gothic script set off with a border: "" My son, attend with zeal to thy business by day; but do none that hinders thee from thy sleep by night. "" He had also stated that his old Wittenberg Bible was to descend to his eldest son, and thence from first-born to first-born in each generation."

"»Sie sind glücklich«, sagte er plötzlich, indem er eine Hand auf des Senators Knie legte und mit schwimmendem Blick zu ihm emporsah. »… O doch! Versündigen Sie sich nicht, indem Sie das leugnen! Sie sind glücklich! Sie halten das Glück in den Armen! Sie sind ausgezogen und haben es sich mit starkem Arm erobert … mit starker Hand!« verbesserte er sich, weil er die zu schnelle Wiederholung des Wortes »Arm« nicht ertragen konnte. Dann verstummte er, und ohne ein Wort von des Senators abwehrender und resignierter Antwort zu vernehmen, fuhr er fort, ihm mit einer dunklen Träumerei ins Gesicht zu blicken. Plötzlich richtete er sich auf.","""You're happy,"" he said suddenly, laying a hand on the senator's knee and looking up at him with swimming eyes. ""… Oh yes! Don't sin by denying it! Are you happy! You hold happiness in your arms! They undressed and took it with a strong arm… with a strong hand!” he corrected himself, unable to bear the word “arm” being repeated too quickly. Then he fell silent, and without hearing a word of the senator's defensive and resigned reply, continued to stare him in the face with a dark reverie. Suddenly he straightened up.","“What a fortunate man you are,” he suddenly said, laying his hand on the senator’s knee and looking up at him with moist eyes. “Oh, but you are. To deny it would be a sin. You are fortunate. You hold fortune in your arms. You ventured forth and your strong arm was victorious— your strong hand,” he corrected himself, because he could not bear the repetition of the word “arm.” Then he fell silent and, without listening to a word of the senator’s reply of resigned demurral, he went on gazing into his face in a kind of dark reverie. Suddenly he sat up straight.","Suddenly--""You are happy,"" he said, laying his hand on the Senator's knee, and looking up at him with swimming eyes. ""Don't deny it--it would be sacrilege. You are happy. You hold, fortune in your arms. You have reached out your strong arms and conquered her--your strong hands,"" he corrected himself, not liking the sound of ""arms"" twice so close together. He was silent, and the Senator's depre-cating, patient reply went unheard. He seemed to be darkly dreaming for a moment; then he got up."
"»Gewiß, allerdings Frau Konsulin«, sprach Herr Marcus. »Ich bitte ergebenst, überzeugt zu sein, daß ich die Ehrung meiner Person, welche in diesem Anerbieten liegt, mit Dankbarkeit zu schätzen weiß, denn die Mittel, welche ich der Firma entgegenzubringen vermag, sind nur allzu geringe.

Wenn ich an Grünlich denke … o Gott! er sagte beständig, daß er rege und findig sei, und bemäntelte in tückischer Weise seine Filouhaftigkeit … So ist Permaneder nicht, siehst du. Er ist, möchte ich sagen, zu bequem dazu, und nimmt das Leben zu gemütlich dazu, was übrigens andererseits auch wieder ein Vorwurf ist, denn Millionär wird er sicher nicht werden und neigt, glaube ich, ein bißchen dazu, sich gehen zu lassen und so weiterzuwursteln, wie sie da unten sagen … Denn sie sind alle so dort unten, und das ist es, was ich sagen wollte, Ida, das ist die Sache. Nämlich in München, wo er unter seinesgleichen war, unter Leuten, die so sprachen und so waren wie er, da liebte ich ihn geradezu, so nett fand ich ihn, so treuherzig und behaglich. Und ich merkte auch gleich, daß es gegenseitig war, – wozu vielleicht beitrug, daß er mich für eine reiche Frau hält, für reicher, fürchte ich, als ich bin, denn Mutter kann mir nicht mehr viel mitgeben, wie du weißt … Aber das wird ihm nichts ausmachen, bin ich überzeugt.

When I think of Grünlich... oh God! he kept saying that he was active and resourceful, and in a sly way cloaked his ruthlessness... Permaneder isn't like that, you see is a reproach again because he's definitely not going to be a millionaire and I think he's a bit inclined to let himself go and muddle along like they say down there... Because they're all down there like that and that's what I wanted to say, Ida, that's the thing. Namely in Munich, where he was among his own kind, among people who spoke and were like him, I really loved him, I found him so nice, so innocent and comfortable. And I noticed right away that it was mutual – which perhaps contributed to the fact that he thinks I'm a rich woman, richer than I am, I'm afraid, because mother can't give me much to take away with me, as you know...

He was always saying how industrious and inventive he was, and cloaked his villainy in the most cunning ways. But Permaneder’s not like that, you see. He is, I would say, too comfortable a man for that, he takes life too easy—which is, however, a fault in its own way, too. Because he’ll certainly never be a millionaire, and he tends to just let things take their course, I think—he’ll always just keep muddlin’ through, as they say down south. But they are all like that down there, and that’s what I wanted to say, Ida, that’s the main thing. Because in Munich, when he was among people just like him, who talked like him and acted like him, I really loved him, thought he was so nice and natural and easygoing. And I noticed at once that the feeling was mutual—although that may have had something to do with his thinking I’m a rich woman, much richer , I’m afraid, than I really am.

He was all the time saying how clever and resourceful he was, and all the time hiding his villainy. Permaneder is not in the least like that. You might say he is too easy-going and takes life too comfortably--and that is a fault too; because he will never be a mil-lionaire that way, and he really is too much inclined to let things go and muddle along--as they say down there.

"War der verstorbene Konsul, mit seiner schwärmerischen Liebe zu Gott und dem Gekreuzigten, der erste seines Geschlechtes gewesen, der unalltägliche, unbürgerliche und differenzierte Gefühle gekannt und gepflegt hatte, so schienen seine beiden Söhne die ersten Buddenbrooks zu sein, die vor dem freien und naiven Hervortreten solcher Gefühle empfindlich zurückschreckten. Sicherlich hatte Thomas mit reizbarerer Schmerzfähigkeit den Tod seines Vaters erlebt, als etwa sein Großvater den Verlust des seinen. Dennoch pflegte er nicht am Grabe in die Knie zu sinken, hatte er sich niemals, wie seine Schwester Tony, über den Tisch geworfen, um zu schluchzen wie ein Kind, empfand er als im höchsten Grade peinlich, die großen, mit Tränen gemischten Worte, mit denen Madame Grünlich zwischen Braten und Nachtisch die Charaktereigenschaften und die Person des toten Vaters zu feiern liebte. Solchen Ausbrüchen gegenüber hatte er einen taktvollen Ernst, ein gefaßtes Schweigen, ein zurückhaltendes Kopfnicken … und gerade dann, wenn niemand des Verstorbenen erwähnt oder gedacht hatte, füllten sich, ohne daß sein Gesichtsausdruck sich verändert hätte, langsam seine Augen mit Tränen.","If the deceased Consul, with his rapturous love for God and the Crucified, was the first of his generation to have known and nurtured unusual, unbourgeois and differentiated feelings, his two sons seemed to be the first Buddenbrooks, before the free and naive the emergence of such feelings sensitively recoiled. Certainly Thomas had experienced his father's death with a more irritable capacity for pain than, say, his grandfather had experienced the loss of his. Yet he was not in the habit of sinking on his knees at the grave, he had never thrown himself over the table like his sister Tony, to sob like a child, he found it extremely embarrassing to hear the big words mixed with tears, with which Madame Grünlich loved to celebrate the character traits and the personality of her dead father between the roast and dessert. In the face of such outbursts he had a tactful seriousness, a composed silence, a reticent nod of the head . . . and just when no one had mentioned or thought of the deceased, without changing his facial expression, his eyes slowly filled with tears.","Given his fanatical love of God and the crucified Saviour, the late consul was probably the first of his lineage to know and cultivate feelings that were out of the ordinary, more differentiated, alien to his solid middle-class heritage. But his two sons were the first Buddenbrooks who were uneasy and frightened by the naïve and frank display of such feelings. To be sure, Thomas felt the pain of his father’s death more acutely than his grandfather had felt the loss of his. But he was not the sort to sink to his knees beside a grave; no, he was not like his sister, not like Madame Grünlich, who loved to lay her head on the table, after the main course and before dessert, and sob like a child, her words blending with her tears as she recalled the person and personality of her dear, departed father. Tom responded to such effusions with tactful gravity, with reserved nods and composed silence. And yet, at moments when no one had so much as mentioned his dead father, tears would slowly fill his eyes—with no change at all in his facial expression.","The deceased Consul's fanatical love of Cod and of the Saviour had been an emotion foreign to his forebears, who never cherished other than the normal, every-day sentiments proper to good citizens. The two living Buddenbrooks had in their turn their own idiosyncrasies. One of these appeared to be a nervous distaste for the expression of feeling. Thomas had certainly felt the death of his father with painful acute-ness, much as his grandfather had felt the loss of his. But he could not sink on his knees by his grave. He had never, like his sister Tony, flung himself across the table sobbing like a child; and he shrank from hearing the heart-broken words in which Madame Gr�nlich, from roast to dessert, loved to celebrate the character and person of her dead father. Such outbursts he met with composed silence or a reserved nod. And yet, when nobody had mentioned or was thinking of the dead, it would be just then that his eyes would fill with slow tears, although his facial expression remained un-changed."

Das Betriebskapital aber lag brach seit langen Jahren, mit dem pfennigweisen Geschäftemachen, dessen sich der Senator zur Zeit der Pöppenrader Ernteangelegenheit angeklagt hatte, war es seit dem Schlage, den er damals empfangen, nicht besser, sondern schlimmer geworden, und jetzt, in einer Zeit, da alles sich frisch und siegesfroh regte, da seit dem Eintritt der Stadt in den Zollverband kleine Krämergeschäfte imstande waren, sich binnen weniger Jahre zu angesehenen Großhandlungen zu entwickeln, jetzt ruhte die Firma Johann Buddenbrook, ohne irgendeinen Vorteil aus den Errungenschaften der Zeit zu ziehen, und über den Gang der Geschäfte befragt, antwortete der Chef mit matt abwehrender Handbewegung: »Ach, dabei ist nicht viel Freude …« Ein lebhafterer Konkurrent, der ein naher Freund der Hagenströms war, tat die Äußerung, daß Thomas Buddenbrook an der Börse eigentlich nur noch dekorativ wirke, und dieser Scherz, der auf das sorgfältig gepflegte Äußere des Senators anspielte, wurde von den Bürgern als eine unerhörte Leistung gewandter Dialektik bewundert und belacht.","As far as purely business matters were concerned, his fortune was generally considered to be greatly reduced and the company to be in decline. Nevertheless, his maternal inheritance, including his share in the Mengstrasse house and the property, was a man worth more than six hundred thousand marks. The working capital, however, lay idle for many years, with the penny-wise business of which the senator had accused himself at the time of the Pöppenrader harvest affair, things had not gotten better since the blow he received at that time, but worse, and now, at a time , since everything was moving freshly and happily, since the town's entry into the customs association, small grocers were able to develop into respectable wholesalers within a few years, the Johann Buddenbrook company now rested without taking any advantage of the achievements of the time , and when asked about the course of business, the boss replied with a faint wave of his hand: ""Oh, there's not much joy in that..."" A livelier competitor, who was a close friend of the Hagenstroms, remarked that Thomas Buddenbrook was actually on the stock exchange was only decorative, and this joke, which alluded to the senator's carefully groomed appearance, was replaced by d admired and laughed at by the citizens as an outrageous achievement of skilful dialectics.","Purely in terms of business, it was generally acknowledged that his fortunes were greatly reduced and that the firm was on the decline. And yet, if one included his inheritance from his mother and his share from the sale of the house and lot on Meng Strasse, he was worth more than six hundred thousand marks courant. The firm’s capital, however, had been lying fallow for years. It was the same small-scale, pennywise operation that the senator had complained of back in the days when he was considering buying the Pöppenrade harvest; in fact, matters had only grown worse after that setback. Ever since the town had joined the Customs Union, the general business climate had been robust and triumphantly optimistic—little retail shops were able to grow into prestigious wholesale operations within a very few years. But the firm of Johann Buddenbrook slept, unable to profit from the achievements of modern times, and when someone asked its owner how business was doing, he would answer with a tired, dismissive gesture, “Oh, not much pleasure in it these days.” An energetic competitor, a close friend of the Hagenströms, was heard to say that Thomas Buddenbrook’s only function on the market was purely decorative; and the joke, playing as it did off the senator’s neatly groomed appearance, evoked the laughter and admiration of the locals, who regarded it as an unprecedented rhetorical achievement.","As for money matters, his estate was much reduced and the business, in general, on the decline. Counting his mother's inheritance and his share of the Meng Street property, he was still worth more than six hundred thousand marks. But the working capital of the firm had lain fallow for years, under the penny wise policies of which the Senator had complained at the time of the affair of the Piippenrade harvest. Since the blow he had then received, they had grown worse instead of better; until now, at a time when prospects were brighter than ever--when everybody was flushed with victory, the city had at last joined the Customs Union, and small retail firms all over the country were growing within a few years into large wholesale ones--the firm of Johann Buddenbrook rested on its oars and reaped no ad-215 vantage from the favourable time. If the head of the firm were asked after his business, he would answer, with a deprecating wave of the hand, ""Oh, it's not much good, these days."" As a lively rival, a close friend of the Hagenstro'ms, once put it, Thomas Buddenbrook's function on 'Change was now largely decorative! The jest had for its point a jeer at the Senator's carefully preserved and faultless exterior--and it was received as a masterpiece of wit by his fellow-citizens."

"Der Konsul reiste, und er kehrte in zorniger und trüber Stimmung zurück. Da aber aus München noch immer keine Nachricht gekommen war, so sah er sich genötigt, den ersten Schritt zu tun. Er schrieb; schrieb kühl, sachlich und ein wenig von oben herab: Unleugbar sei Antonie im Zusammenleben mit Permaneder schweren Enttäuschungen ausgesetzt gewesen … auch abgesehen von Einzelheiten habe sie im großen und ganzen das erhoffte Glück in dieser Ehe nicht finden können … ihr Wunsch, das Bündnis gelöst zu sehen, müsse dem billig Denkenden berechtigt erscheinen … leider scheine ihr Entschluß, nicht nach München zurückzukehren, unerschütterlich festzustehen … Und es folgte die Frage, wie Permaneder sich diesen Tatsachen gegenüber verhalte …","The consul went and he returned angry and dejected. But since there was still no news from Munich, he felt compelled to take the first step. He wrote; wrote coolly, matter-of-factly and a little condescendingly: Undeniably, Antonie had been exposed to severe disappointments in living with Permaneder ... even apart from details, on the whole she had not been able to find the happiness she had hoped for in this marriage ... her desire to dissolve the alliance see, must appear justified to those who think cheaply ... unfortunately her decision not to return to Munich seems to be unshakable ... And the question then followed as to how Permaneder was reacting to these facts ...","The consul left on his trip, and returned in an angry, depressed mood. And since there had been no news from Munich, he felt he had no choice but to take the first step. He wrote—a cool, businesslike, and slightly supercilious letter. He noted that it could not be denied that in her married life with Herr Permaneder Antonie had met with a series of grave disappointments. Without his going into detail, it was clear that she had not found the happiness she had hoped from her marriage. Any reasonable man would see that her wish to dissolve the union was justified. Her decision not to return to Munich appeared, unfortunately, to be irrevocable. And then followed the question as to how Permaneder intended to act in light of these facts.","The Consul went to Hamburg, and came back angry and depressed. No word had come from Munich, and he felt obliged to take the first step. He wrote; wrote rather coldly, with curt condescension, to this effect: Antonie, during her life with Permaneder, had been subjected to great disappointments--that would not be denied. Without going into detail, it was evident that she could never find happiness in this marriage. Her wish that it should be dissolved must be justified, to the mind of any reasonable person; and her determination not to return to Munich was entirely unshakable. And he put the question as to what were Herr Permaneder's feelings in view of the facts which he had just stated."
"Frau Permaneder saß an dem Himmelbett, dessen Vorhänge zurückgeschlagen waren, und hielt die Hand ihrer Mutter, die, von Kissen gestützt, den Kopf dem Eintretenden zuwandte und ihm mit ihren hellblauen Augen forschend ins Gesicht sah. Es war ein Blick voll beherrschter Ruhe und von angespannter, unausweichlicher Eindringlichkeit, der, da er ein wenig von der Seite kam, beinahe etwas Lauerndes hatte. Abgesehen von der Blässe der Haut, die auf den Wangen ein paar Flecke von fieberiger Röte hervortreten ließ, zeigte dies Gesicht durchaus keine Mattigkeit und Schwäche. Die alte Dame war sehr aufmerksam bei der Sache, aufmerksamer noch als ihre Umgebung, denn am Ende war sie die zunächst Beteiligte. Sie mißtraute dieser Krankheit und war ganz und gar nicht gewillt, sich aufs Ohr zu legen und den Dingen nachgiebig ihren Lauf zu lassen …","Frau Permaneder sat by the four-poster bed, the curtains of which were drawn back, and held the hand of her mother, who, propped up by pillows, turned her head towards the person entering and looked searchingly into his face with her light blue eyes. It was a look of controlled calm and of a tense, inescapable urgency that, being a little off to one side, had something almost lurking about it. Apart from the pallor of the skin, which showed a few spots of feverish red on the cheeks, there was no weariness or weakness in that face. The old lady was very attentive to the matter, even more so than those around her, because in the end she was the first person involved. She distrusted this disease and was not at all willing to lie back and let things take their course...","The curtains of the four-poster were pulled back, and Frau Permaneder was sitting on the bed, holding her mother’s hand. She lay propped up on her pillows, her head turned toward the door, and she searched the senator’s face with her pale blue eyes. It was a sidelong glance, full of both composure and instinctive, tense urgency—almost as if she were lying in ambush for him. Apart from her pallor and a feverish red spot on each cheek, there was no trace of exhaustion or infirmity in her face. The old woman was quite alert, more alert than those around her—she was, after all, the party most directly concerned. She did not trust this illness, and was most definitely not inclined to lie back in her bed and idly let matters take their course.","Frau Permaneder sat by the high bed, the hangings of which were thrust back, and held her mother's hand. The old lady was propped up on pillows. She turned her head as her son came in, and looked searchingly with her pale blue eyes into his face--a look of calm self-control, yet of deliberate insistence. Coming as it did, slightly sidewise, there was almost something sinister about it, too. Two red spots stood out upon the pallor of her cheeks, but there were no signs of weakness or exhaustion. The old lady was very wide awake, more so in fact than those around her--for. after all, she was the person most concerned. And she mis-trusted this illness; she was not at all disposed to lie down and let it have its own way."

"Der kleine Johann Buddenbrook lag auf dem Rücken, hatte aber sein von dem langen, hellbraunen Haar umrahmtes Gesichtchen dem Zimmer zugewandt und atmete mit einem leichten Geräusch in das Kopfkissen hinein. Von seinen Händen, deren Finger kaum aus den viel zu langen und weiten Ärmeln seines Nachthemdes hervorsahen, lag die eine auf seiner Brust, die andere neben ihm auf der Steppdecke, und dann und wann zuckten die gekrümmten Finger leise. Auch an den halb geöffneten Lippen war eine schwache Bewegung bemerkbar, als versuchten sie, Worte zu bilden. Von Zeit zu Zeit ging, von unten nach oben, etwas Schmerzliches über dieses ganze Gesichtchen, das, mit einem Erzittern des Kinnes beginnend, sich über die Mundpartie fortpflanzte, die zarten Nüstern vibrieren ließ und die Muskeln der schmalen Stirn in Bewegung versetzte … Die langen Wimpern vermochten nicht die bläulichen Schatten zu verdecken, die in den Augenwinkeln lagerten.","Little Johann Buddenbrook was lying on his back, but his little face, framed by his long, light brown hair, was turned towards the room and he was breathing gently into the pillow.

There was also a faint movement on the half-open lips, as if trying to form words. From time to time, from bottom to top, something painful went over that little face, which, beginning with a trembling of the chin, spread to the mouth area, made the delicate nostrils vibrate and set the muscles of the narrow forehead in motion...

His half-opened lips were moving faintly, too, as if trying to form words. From time to time an almost pained expression flickered across his whole face, beginning with a trembling of the chin, then of the mouth, followed by a vibration of his delicate nostrils, and ending in a twitch of the muscles of his brow.

Incidentally, painful memories are linked to the name of the river. As boys we thought it was funny to pinch each other's arms and ask: What's the name of the river near Schwartau?

There are some rather painful memories connected with the name of that little river. When we were boys, we thought it great sport to pinch each other in the arm and ask, ‘What’s the name of Schwartau’s river?’ And the pinches hurt, of course, so we would reluctantly supply the correct answer.

"Als die übrigen Mitglieder der Gesellschaft, bepackt mit mehreren großen Düten voll Pfeffernüssen, wieder im Freien erschienen, ließ der Konsul seine Augen diskret über die Köpfe der beiden hinwegschweifen, denn sie waren in starker Verlegenheit: Herr Permaneder ohne Versuch, das zu verbergen, Tony unter der Maske einer fast majestätischen Würde.","When the rest of the party reappeared outside, laden with several large bags of ginger nuts, the Consul let his eyes rove discreetly over their heads, for they were greatly embarrassed: Herr Permaneder, making no attempt to hide it, Tony under the mask of an almost majestic dignity.","When the rest of the party, laden with large sacks of gingersnaps, emerged from the shop, Thomas let his eyes drift discreetly over their heads—they were both obviously very embarrassed.

"Gleichwohl war er selbst es, der zur Entstehung dieser Anschauungsweise am meisten beigetragen hatte. Er war ein reicher Mann, und keiner der Verluste, die er erlitten, auch den schweren des Jahres sechsundsechzig nicht ausgenommen, hatte die Existenz der Firma ernstlich in Frage stellen können. Aber obgleich er, wie selbstverständlich, fortfuhr, in angemessener Weise zu repräsentieren und seinen Diners die Anzahl von Gängen zu geben, die seine Gäste von ihnen erwarteten, hatte doch die Vorstellung, sein Glück und Erfolg sei dahin, diese Vorstellung, die mehr eine innere Wahrheit war, als daß sie auf äußere Tatsachen gegründet gewesen wäre, ihn in einen Zustand so argwöhnischer Verzagtheit versetzt, daß er, wie niemals zuvor, das Geld an sich zu halten und in seinem Privatleben in fast kleinlicher Weise zu sparen begann. Hundertmal hatte er den kostspieligen Bau seines neuen Hauses verwünscht, das ihm, so empfand er, nichts als Unheil gebracht hatte. Die Sommerreisen wurden eingestellt, und der kleine Stadtgarten mußte den Aufenthalt am Strande oder im Gebirge ersetzen. Die Mahlzeiten, die er gemeinsam mit seiner Gattin und dem kleinen Hanno einnahm, waren auf sein wiederholtes und strenges Geheiß von einer Einfachheit, die im Gegensatze zu dem weiten, parkettierten Speisezimmer mit seinem hohen und luxuriösen Plafond und seinen prachtvollen Eichenmöbeln komisch wirkte. Während längerer Zeit war Dessert nur für den Sonntag gestattet … Die Eleganz seines Äußeren blieb dieselbe; aber Anton, der langjährige Bediente, wußte doch in der Küche zu erzählen, daß der Senator jetzt nur noch jeden zweiten Tag das weiße Hemd wechsele, da die Wäsche das feine Linnen allzusehr ruiniere … Er wußte noch mehr. Er wußte auch, daß er entlassen werden sollte. Gerda protestierte. Drei Dienstboten seien zur Instandhaltung eines so großen Hauses kaum genug. Es half nichts: mit einem angemessenen Geldgeschenk ward Anton, der so lange den Bock eingenommen hatte, wenn Thomas Buddenbrook in den Senat fuhr, verabschiedet.","Nevertheless, it was he himself who had contributed most to the emergence of this way of thinking. He was a rich man, and none of the losses he had suffered, including the heavy one of 1966, had seriously threatened the existence of the firm. But although he went on, as a matter of course, to represent himself appropriately and to give his diners the number of courses his guests expected them to have, yet he had the notion that his happiness and success was gone, that notion, which was more of an inner one Truth, as if based on external facts, had thrown him into such a state of suspicious despondency that he began, as never before, to keep the money to himself and to save in his private life in almost petty ways. A hundred times he had cursed the costly construction of his new house, which he felt had brought him nothing but misery. Summer travel was discontinued, and the small city garden had to replace spending time on the beach or in the mountains. The meals he shared with his wife and little Hanno were, at his repeated and stern bidding, of a simplicity that seemed comical in contrast to the wide, parqueted dining room, with its high and luxurious ceiling and its rich oak furniture. For a long time, dessert was only allowed on Sundays... The elegance of his appearance remained the same; but Anton, the servant of many years, knew how to tell the story in the kitchen that the senator now only changes his white shirt every other day, since the washing ruins the fine linen too badly... He knew even more. He also knew that he should be fired. Gerda protested. Three servants are hardly enough to maintain such a large house. It didn't help: Anton, who had been in the mood for so long when Thomas Buddenbrook went to the Senate, was dismissed with a suitable gift of money.","He himself, however, was the chief source for this impression. He was a rich man, and none of the losses he had endured, not even the especially heavy ones of ’66, could have seriously endangered the firm’s existence. For, although he continued, of course, to play the gracious host, to give dinners with the requisite number of courses his guests had come to expect, the notion that his good luck and success itself had flown—a notion that was more an inner truth for him than one based on external facts—had so reduced him to a condition of despondent worry that he began to hold tight to his money as never before and to save in almost petty ways when it came to private expenditures. He cursed himself a hundred times for having built his extravagant new house, which, or so he felt, had brought him nothing but misfortune. There were no more summer trips, and their little garden in town had to take the place of a stay at the shore or in the mountains. At his express and repeated wish, the meals he shared with his wife and little Hanno were so simple they seemed almost a farce in contrast to the spacious, parqueted dining room with its stately high ceilings and splendid oak furniture. For some time now dessert had been served only on Sunday. He kept up his elegant external appearance; but Anton, their butler of so many years, was able to tell the kitchen staff that the senator changed his white shirt only every other day now—too-frequent washing ruined fine linen. Anton knew other things as well. He knew that he would be let go. Gerda protested—three servants were hardly enough to keep such a large house in good order. But it was to no avail. Anton, who for so many years had sat on the coachbox when Thomas Buddenbrook rode to the senate, was sent on his way—with an appropriate sum of money.","At thf same time, it was true that he himself was mainly responsible. He was still a rich man, and none of the losses he had suffered, even the severe one of the year '66, had seriously undermined the existence of the firm. But the notion that his luik and his consequence had fled, based though it was more, upon inward feelings than upon outward facts, brought him to a state of lowness and suspicion. He enter-tained, of course, as before, and set before his guests the normal and expected number of courses. But, as never before, he began to cling to money and, in his private life, to save in small and petty ways. He had a hundred times regretted the building of his new house, which he felt had brought him nothing but bad luck. The summer holidays were given up, and the little city garden had to take the place of mountains or seashore. The family meals were, by his express and emphatic command, of such simplicity as to seem absurd by contrast with the lofty, splendid dining-room, with its extent of parquetry floors and its imposing oak furniture. For a long lime now, there had been dessert only on Sundays. His own appearance was as elegant as ever; but the old servant, Anton, carried to the kitchen the news that the master only changed his shirt now every other day, as the 79 washing was too hard on the fine linen. He knew more than that. He knew that he was to be dismissed. Gerda pro-tested: three servants were few enough to do the work of so large a house as it should be done. But it was no use: old Anton, who had so long sat on the box when Thomas Budden-brook drove down to the Senate, was sent away with a suit-able present."
"Was hatte er ihr entgegengehalten? Er hatte es sehr gut und eindringlich gesagt, wie er sich erinnerte. »Unreinliche Manipulation … Im Trüben fischen … Brutale Ausbeutung … Einen Wehrlosen übers Ohr hauen … Wucherprofit …« ausgezeichnet! Allein es fragte sich, ob dies die Gelegenheit war, so laute Worte ins Gefecht zu führen. Konsul Hermann Hagenström würde sie nicht gesucht und würde sie nicht gefunden haben. War Thomas Buddenbrook ein Geschäftsmann, ein Mann der unbefangenen Tat oder ein skrupulöser Nachdenker?","What had he said to her? He had said it very well and emphatically, he remembered. ""Unclean manipulation... Fishing in troubled waters... Brutal exploitation... Cheating a defenseless person... Extortionate profit..."" Excellent! But it made one wonder if this was the occasion to use such loud words in battle. Consul Hermann Hagenstrom would not have looked for her and would not have found her. Was Thomas Buddenbrook a businessman, a man of impartial action, or a scrupulous thinker?","What had been his objections? He recalled that he had put it very forcefully and well. “Shabby operation—fishing in troubled waters—brutal exploitation—fleecing a poor, defenseless fellow—usury”—excellent! Except that he now asked himself whether this was an occasion for loud counterarguments. Consul Hermann Hagenström would not have tried to find them, or have used them. Was Thomas Buddenbrook a businessman, a man of dispassionate deeds, or a brooder haunted by scruples?","What had he answered her? He had spoken very impressively, he recollected, about ""underhand manoeuvres,"" ""fishing in troubled waters,"" ""fleecing the poor land-owner,"" ""usury,"" and so on. Very fine! But really one might ask if this were just the right time for so many large words. Consul Hermann Hagenstrbm would not have thought of them, and would not have used them. Was he, Thomas Ruddenbrook, a man of action, a business man--or was he a finicking dreamer?"
"»Mein werter Freund«, sprach der Konsul … »Sie sehen in mir einen Geschäftsmann von Kulanz! Mein Gott … Sie haben mich nicht einmal ausreden lassen, sonst wüßten Sie bereits, daß ich willig und bereit bin, Ihnen den Umständen entsprechend entgegenzukommen, und daß ich den 70000 schlankerhand 10000 hinzufüge.«","“My dear friend,” said the Consul… “You see me as a good-will businessman! My God . . . you didn't even let me finish, or you would already know that I'm willing and ready to accommodate you as the circumstances require, and that I'll add 10,000 to the 70,000 by hand.""","“My good friend,” the consul said, “you see in me a fair-dealing man of business. Good heavens, you didn’t even allow me to finish what I was about to say, otherwise you would have known that I am quite ready and willing to oblige you as present circumstances allow and will add another ten thousand to the seventy without further ado.”","""My good friend,"" said the Consul, ""you see in me a fair-dealing merchant. You have not let me finish, or you would have heard that I am ready and willing to meet you in the circumstances, and add ten thousand marks to the seventy thousand without more ado."""
"Der Mensch fühlt eine seelische Mißstimmung in sich entstehen, die sich rasch vertieft und zu einer hinfälligen Verzweiflung wird. Zu gleicher Zeit bemächtigt sich seiner eine physische Mattigkeit, die sich nicht allein auf Muskeln und Sehnen, sondern auch auf die Funktionen aller inneren Organe erstreckt, und nicht zuletzt auf die des Magens, der die Aufnahme von Speise mit Widerwillen verweigert. Es besteht ein starkes Schlafbedürfnis, allein trotz äußerster Müdigkeit ist der Schlaf unruhig, oberflächlich, beängstigt und unerquicklich. Das Gehirn schmerzt; es ist dumpf, befangen, wie von Nebeln umhüllt, und von Schwindel durchzogen. Ein unbestimmter Schmerz sitzt in allen Gliedern. Hie und da fließt ohne jedwede besondere Veranlassung Blut aus der Nase. – Dies ist die Introduktion.","The human being feels a mental discord arising in himself, which quickly deepens and becomes a futile despair. At the same time, he is seized with a physical fatigue that affects not only the muscles and tendons, but also the functioning of all the internal organs, not least of which is the stomach, which reluctantly refuses to eat. There is a strong need for sleep, but despite extreme tiredness, sleep is restless, superficial, anxious and unrefreshing. The brain hurts; it is dull, self-conscious, as if shrouded in mist, and streaked with dizziness. A vague pain sits in all limbs. Now and then, without any particular cause, blood flows from the nose. – This is the introduction.","In the incubation period, a person feels depressed and moody, and this quickly grows worse, to the point of acute despondency. At the same time he is overcome by physical lassitude, which affects not only his muscles and tendons, but also the function of all internal organs, and most especially the stomach, which rebels and refuses to accept any food. There is a great desire for sleep, but, despite extreme weariness, such sleep is restless, shallow, and nervous and leaves the patient unrefreshed. He experiences headaches, and his mind feels numb, edgy, and dazed, with occasional spells of dizziness. A vague ache invades the limbs. Sporadic nosebleeds occur, for no apparent reason. This is the initial phase.","The patient feels depressed and moody--a condition which grows rapidly worse until it amounts to acute despondency. At the same time he is overpowered by physical weariness, not only of the muscles and sinews, but also of the organic functions, in particular of the digestion--so that the stomach refuses food. There is a great desire for sleep, but even in conditions of extreme fatigue the sleep is restless and super-ficial and not refreshing. There is pain in the head, the brain feels dull and confused, and there are spells of giddi-ness. An indefinite ache is felt in all the bones. There is blood from the nose now and then, without apparent cause.--This is the onset."
"Es war nicht bloß Altersschwäche, was die alte Madame Antoinette Buddenbrook, sechs Jahre ungefähr nachdem die Familie das Haus in der Mengstraße bezogen, an einem kalten Januartag endgültig auf ihr hohes Himmelbett im Schlafzimmer des Zwischengeschosses darniederwarf. Die alte Dame war rüstig gewesen bis zuletzt und hatte ihre dicken weißen Seitenlocken mit aufrechter Würde getragen; sie hatte zusammen mit ihrem Gatten und ihren Kindern die hauptsächlichsten Diners besucht, die in der Stadt gegeben wurden, und bei den Gesellschaften, die Buddenbrooks selbst veranstalteten, ihrer eleganten Schwiegertochter im Repräsentieren nicht nachgestanden. Eines Tages aber, ganz plötzlich, hatte sich ein halb unbestimmbares Leiden eingestellt, ein leichter Darmkatarrh anfangs nur, gegen den Doktor Grabow ein wenig Taube und Franzbrot verordnet hatte, eine mit Erbrechen verbundene Kolik, die mit unbegreiflicher Schnelligkeit Entkräftung herbeiführte, einen sanften und hinfälligen Zustand, der beängstigend war.","It was not mere old age that threw old Madame Antoinette Buddenbrook down on her high four-poster bed in the mezzanine bedroom on a cold January day, about six years after the family moved into the Mengstrasse house. The old lady had been vigorous to the last, and carried her thick white side curls with upright dignity; she had attended, with her husband and children, the principal dinners that were held in the city, and at the parties which the Buddenbrooks themselves gave, she had not been inferior in representation to her elegant daughter-in-law. But one day, quite suddenly, a half indefinable ailment had set in, at first only a slight intestinal catarrh, against which Doctor Grabow had prescribed a little dove and French bread, a colic associated with vomiting, which with incomprehensible rapidity brought about a mild and weakened exhaustion condition that was scary.","IT WAS NOT SIMPLY old age that caused Madame Antoinette Buddenbrook to take to her high four-poster in the bedroom on the mezzanine one cold January day, some six years after the family had moved into the house on Meng Strasse. The old woman had been hale and hearty to the end, carrying her head with its thick white curls proud and erect; she had continued to join her husband and children at all the town’s principal banquets and had been as gracious a hostess as her elegant daughter-in-law at the parties the Buddenbrooks had themselves given. One day, however, she took ill with something rather undefinable; at first it was only a slight intestinal catarrh, for which Dr. Grabow prescribed a little squab and French bread, but then a colic set in with vomiting spells, which with incredible speed led to a general enervation, a state of gentle, but quite alarming, infirmity.","IT was not simply the weakness of age that made Madame Antoinette Buddenbrook take to her lofty bed in the bed-chamber of the entresol, one cold January day after they had dwelt some six years in Meng Street. The old lady had re-mained hale and active, and carried her head, with its clustering white side-curls, proudly erect to the very last. She had gone with her husband and children to most of the large din-ners given in the town, and presided no whit less elegantly than her daughter-in-law when the Buddenbrooks themselves entertained. But one day an indefinable malady had suddenly made itself felt--at first in the form of a slight intestinal catarrh, for which Dr. Crabow prescribed a mild diet of pigeon and French bread. This had been followed by colic and vomiting, which reduced her strength so rapidly as to bring about an alarming decline."

"»Unerhört«, sagte Frau Grünlich, indem sie die Hände im Schoße faltete und zum Plafond emporblickte … »Großvaters Grundstück! Gut, damit ist das Besitztum verpfuscht. Der Reiz bestand gerade in der Weitläufigkeit … die eigentlich überflüssig war … aber das war das Vornehme. Der große Garten … bis zur Trave hinunter … und das zurückliegende Haus mit der Auffahrt, der Kastanienallee … Nun wird es also geteilt. Benthien wird vor der einen Tür stehen und seine Pfeife rauchen, und Sörenson vor der anderen. Ja, ich sage auch ›Gott befohlen‹, Onkel Justus.

Good, so the property is botched. The appeal was precisely in the spaciousness ... which was actually superfluous ... but that was the distinction.

Benthien will be standing in front of one door, smoking his pipe, and Sorenson in front of the other. Yes, I also say 'God bless', Uncle Justus. There is probably nobody noble enough to inhabit the whole thing.

Well, that certainly makes a botch of the property. The charm was in the extensive grounds—far too extensive, of course, but that was what made it so elegant. The large gardens stretching down to the Trave, and the house set back from the road, and the driveway bordered with chestnuts. So it’s to be divided. Fine. Benthien will stand at his front door, smoking his pipe, and Sörenson at his. Yes, I agree with you, Uncle Justus, it’s in God’s hands. There’s probably no one elegant enough to occupy the whole property. It’s a good thing that Grandpapa never lived to see it.”","God bless us!"" ""Whoever heard the like?"" said Frau Gr�nlich, folding her ffands in her lap and gazing up at the ceiling. "" Grandfather's property! Well, now the estate is all haggled up. Its great charm was its extent: there was really too much of it, but that was what made it elegant. The large garden, all the way down to the Trave, the house set far back with the drive, and the chestnut avenue. So it is to be divided. Benthien will stand in front of one door and Sorenson in front of the other. I say, 'God bless us,' too, Uncle Justus! I suppose there is nobody grand enough these days to occupy the whole thing. It is good that Grandpapa is not here to see it."""
"Fräulein Buddenbrook war stehengeblieben, da Herr Grünlich zu sprechen begann; aber ihre Augen, die sie halb geschlossen hatte und die plötzlich dunkel wurden, richteten sich nicht höher als auf Herrn Grünlichs Brust, und um ihren Mund lag das spöttische und vollkommen unbarmherzige Lächeln, mit dem ein junges Mädchen einen Mann mißt und verwirft … Ihre Lippen bewegten sich – was sollte sie antworten?

"Er bog rechts ab und schlug also nicht den Weg zu seinem Hause ein. Korrekt, tadellos sauber und elegant ging er mit dem etwas hüpfenden Schritte, der ihm eigen war, die Breite Straße entlang, indem er beständig nach allen Seiten zu grüßen hatte. Er trug weiße Glacéhandschuhe und hielt seinen Stock mit silberner Krücke unter dem linken Arm. Hinter den dicken Revers seines Pelzes sah man die weiße Frackkrawatte. Aber sein sorgfältig hergerichteter Kopf sah übernächtig aus. Verschiedene Leute bemerkten im Vorübergehen, daß ihm plötzlich die Tränen in die geröteten Augen stiegen, und daß er die Lippen auf eine ganz sonderbare, behutsame und verzerrte Weise geschlossen hielt. Manchmal schluckte er hinunter, als habe sein Mund sich mit Flüssigkeit gefüllt; und dann konnte man an den Bewegungen der Muskeln an Wangen und Schläfen beobachten, daß er die Kiefer zusammenbiß.","He turned right and so did not take the route to his house. Correct, impeccably clean, and elegant, he walked along the Breite Strasse with the somewhat hopping stride that was characteristic of him, constantly having to say hello in all directions. He wore white kid gloves and held his cane with a silver crutch under his left arm. His white tailcoat tie was visible behind the thick lapels of his fur coat. But his carefully trimmed head looked bleary-eyed. Various people in passing remarked that tears suddenly welled up in his reddened eyes, and that he kept his lips closed in a very strange, gentle, and contorted way. Sometimes he gulped, as if his mouth had filled with liquid; and then you could see by the movements of the muscles of his cheeks and temples that he clenched his jaws.","He turned to the right, which meant he was not heading home. Correct, impeccably neat, and elegant, he walked along Breite Strasse with his characteristic, slightly skipping gait and was constantly forced to greet people as he went. He was wearing white kid gloves and carried his cane with its silver crook under his left arm. Bits of his white dress tie were visible under the thick lapels of his fur coat. He was carefully groomed as always, but he looked exhausted. As he passed, various people noticed that tears would suddenly well up in his eyes and that his lips were set tight, but in an odd, cautious, skewed sort of way. Sometimes he would swallow hard, as if his mouth were full of liquid, and they could tell from the muscles of his cheeks and temples that he was holding his jaw clenched tight.","He did not take the street to his own house, but turned to the right instead. He looked correct, spotless, and elegant as, with the rather hopping step peculiar to him, he walked along Broad Street, constantly saluting people whom he met. He wore white kid gloves, and he had his stick with the silver handle under his left arm. A white dress tie peeped forth from between the lapels of his fur coat. But his head and face, despite their careful grooming, looked rather seedy. People who passed him noticed that his eyes were watering and that he held his mouth sh'ut in a peculiar cautious way; it was twisted a little to one side, and one could see by the musrles of his cheeks and temples that he was clenching his jaw. Sometimes he swallowed, as if a liquid kept rising in his mouth."
"Gerda war ein wenig apart und hatte etwas Fremdes und Ausländisches an sich; sie liebte es, ihr prachtvolles rotes Haar trotz Sesemis Einspruch etwas auffallend zu frisieren, und viele fanden es albern, daß sie die Geige spiele – wobei zu bemerken ist, daß »albern« einen sehr harten Ausdruck der Verurteilung bedeutete. Darin jedoch mußte man mit Tony übereinstimmen, daß Gerda Arnoldsen ein vornehmes Mädchen war. Ihre für ihr Alter voll entwickelte Erscheinung, ihre Gewohnheiten, die Dinge, die sie besaß, alles war vornehm: Zum Beispiel die elfenbeinerne Toiletteneinrichtung aus Paris, die Tony besonders zu schätzen wußte, da sich auch bei ihr zu Hause allerlei Gegenstände vorfanden, die ihre Eltern oder Großeltern aus Paris mitgebracht hatten und sehr wert hielten.","Gerda was a bit different and had something strange and foreign about her; she loved to do her gorgeous red hair in a flashy way, despite Sesemi's objections, and many thought her playing the violin silly—though it should be noted that 'silly' meant a very harsh term of condemnation.

The neighbors who lived in the solid, gabled houses propped themselves in their windows and watched the men at work on the scaffolds, took great delight in seeing the walls rise, and tried to guess the date for the roof-raising.","Autumn came, and the grey walls crumbled to heaps of rubbish, and Thomas Buddenbrook's new house rose above its roomy cellars, while winter set in and slowly waned again. In all the town there was no pleasanter topic of con-versation. It was ""tip-top""--it was the finest dwelling-house far and wide. But it must cost like the deuce--the old Consul would never have spent money so recklessly. Thus the neighbours, the middle-class dwellers in the gabled houses, looking out at the workmen on the scaffoldings, enjoying the sight of the rising walls, and speculating on the date of the carpenters' feast."

"Die beiden gingen über den Kinderspielplatz mit den Bänken und der großen Schaukel; sie gingen nahe am Warmbadehause vorbei und wanderten langsam über das Leuchtenfeld.

"Kaum hatte sie ihre Lider geschlossen, als sie sich wieder in Travemünde in der Veranda befand. Sie sah Morten Schwarzkopf leibhaftig vor sich, wie er zu ihr sprach, sich nach seiner Art dabei vorbeugte und hie und da einen anderen gutmütig forschend ansah; wie er lachend seine schönen Zähne zeigte, von denen er ersichtlich gar nichts wußte … und es wurde ihr ganz ruhig und heiter dabei zu Sinn. Sie rief sich alles ins Gedächtnis zurück, was sie in vielen Gesprächen von ihm gehört und erfahren hatte, und es bereitete ihr eine beglückende Genugtuung, sich feierlich zu versprechen, daß sie dies alles als etwas Heiliges und Unantastbares in sich bewahren wollte. Daß der König von Preußen ein großes Unrecht begangen, daß die Städtischen Anzeigen ein klägliches Blättchen seien, ja selbst, daß vor vier Jahren die Bundesgesetze über die Universitäten erneuert worden, das würden ihr fortan ehrwürdige und tröstliche Wahrheiten sein, ein geheimer Schatz, den sie würde betrachten können, wann sie wollte. Mitten auf der Straße, im Familienkreise, beim Essen würde sie daran denken … Wer weiß? vielleicht würde sie ihren vorgezeichneten Weg gehen und Herrn Grünlich heiraten, das war ganz gleichgültig; aber wenn er zu ihr sprach, würde sie plötzlich denken: Ich weiß etwas, was du nicht weißt … Die Adeligen sind – im Prinzip gesprochen – verächtlich!","She had hardly closed her eyelids when she was back in Travemünde on the veranda. She saw Morten Schwarzkopf in person, how he spoke to her, leaning forward in his own way and now and then looking good-naturedly at someone else; how he laughingly showed his beautiful teeth, of which he obviously knew nothing ... and she understood it quite calmly and cheerfully. She recalled everything she had heard and experienced from him in many conversations, and it gave her a happy satisfaction to promise herself solemnly that she wanted to keep all this within herself as something sacred and inviolable. That the King of Prussia had committed a great injustice, that the municipal advertisements were a pathetic little piece of paper, even that four years ago the federal laws on the universities had been renewed would from now on be venerable and comforting truths to her, a secret treasure that she would be able to look at whenever she wanted. In the middle of the street, with her family, she would think about it while eating... Who knows? maybe she would go her way and marry Herr Grünlich, it didn't matter; but if he spoke to her she would suddenly think: I know something you don't know... The nobles are - in principle speaking - contemptible!","She had only to close her eyes and she was back on the porch in Travemünde. She saw Morten Schwarzkopf—he was so real, and he spoke to her, bending forward in that special way of his, now and then turning his kind, probing eyes to gaze at someone else; he smiled, and wasn’t even aware of how beautiful his teeth were. And it made her feel quite calm and serene. She could recall everything, all their many conversations, everything he had said, everything she had learned, and she found happy consolation in her solemn promise that she would keep all this in her heart forever as something sacred and inviolable. That the King of Prussia had committed a great injustice, that the local Advertiser was a pitiful rag, even that they had renewed the Confederation’s laws dealing with universities four years ago—those would be cherished and consoling truths, a secret treasure that she could enjoy whenever she liked. In the middle of the street, at home with her family, at the dinner table—she would think of them. Who knew? Perhaps she would follow the path laid out for her and marry Herr Grünlich, she didn’t care one way or the other. But whenever he would speak to her, she would suddenly be able to think: “I know something you don’t. The nobility, as an institution, is despicable.”","But directly her eyes were shut, she found herself again in Travemiinde, on the verandah. She saw Morten in the flesh before her; he seemed to speak and to lean toward her as he always did, and then look good-naturedly and searchingly at the next person, unconsciously showing his beautiful teeth as he smiled. Slowly her mini grew calm and peaceful again. She recalled everything that she had heard and learned from him in many a talk, and it solaced her to promise herself that she would preserve all this as a secret holy and inviolate and cherish it in her heart. That the King of Prussia had committed a great wrong against his people; that the local newspaper w, as a lamentable sheet; yes, that the laws of the League concerning universities had been renewed four years ago--all these were from now on consoling and edifying truths, a hidden treasure which she might store up within her-self and contemplate whenever she chose. On the street, in the family circle, at the table she would think of them. Who knew? Perhaps she might even go on in the path prescribed for her and marry Herr Gr�nlich--that was a detail, after all-- but when he spoke to her she could always say to her-self, ""I know something you don't: the nobility is in principle despicable."""
"»Ich sterbe nicht? Gut, ich sterbe also nicht! Wir werden ja sehen, wer von uns beiden früher stirbt!… Arbeite! Wenn ich aber nicht kann? Wenn ich es nun aber auf die Dauer nicht kann, Herr Gott im Himmel?! Ich kann nicht lange Zeit dasselbe tun, ich werde elend davon! Wenn du es gekonnt hast und kannst, so freue dich doch, aber sitze nicht zu Gericht, denn ein Verdienst ist nicht dabei … Gott gibt dem einen Kraft und dem anderen nicht … Aber so bist du, Thomas«, fuhr er fort, indem er sich mit immer verzerrterem Gesicht über den Tisch beugte und immer heftiger auf die Platte pochte … »Du bist selbstgerecht … ach, warte nur, das ist es nicht, was ich sagen wollte und was ich gegen dich vorzubringen habe … Aber ich weiß nicht, wo ich anfangen soll, und das, was ich werde sagen können, ist nur der tausendste … ach, es ist nur der millionste Teil von dem, was ich gegen dich auf dem Herzen habe! Du hast dir einen Platz im Leben erobert, eine geehrte Stellung, und da stehst du nun und weisest kalt und mit Bewußtsein alles zurück, was dich einen Augenblick beirren und dein Gleichgewicht stören könnte, denn das Gleichgewicht, das ist dir das Wichtigste. Aber es ist nicht das Wichtigste, Thomas, es ist vor Gott nicht die Hauptsache! Du bist ein Egoist, ja, das bist du! Ich liebe dich noch, wenn du schiltst und auftrittst und einen niederdonnerst. Aber am schlimmsten ist dein Schweigen, am schlimmsten ist es, wenn du auf etwas, was man gesagt hat, plötzlich verstummst und dich zurückziehst und jede Verantwortung ablehnst, vornehm und intakt, und den anderen hilflos seiner Beschämung überläßt … Du bist so ohne Mitleid und Liebe und Demut … Ach!« rief er plötzlich, indem er beide Hände hinter seinen Kopf bewegte und sie dann weit vorwärts stieß, als wehrte er die ganze Welt von sich ab … »Wie satt ich das alles habe, dies Taktgefühl und Feingefühl und Gleichgewicht, diese Haltung und Würde … wie sterbenssatt!…« Und dieser letzte Ruf war in einem solchen Grade echt, er kam so sehr von Herzen und brach mit einem solchen Nachdruck von Widerwillen und Überdruß hervor, daß er tatsächlich etwas Niederschmetterndes hatte, ja, daß Thomas ein wenig zusammensank und eine Weile wortlos und mit müder Miene vor sich niederblickte.","""I'm not dying? Good, so I'm not dying! We'll see which of us dies sooner!... Work! But what if I can't? But what if I can't do it in the long run, Lord God in heaven?!

God gives strength to one and not to the other... But that is how you are, Thomas,' he continued, saying, leaning over the table, face ever more contorted, pounding harder and harder on the plate... ""You're being self-righteous... oh wait, that's not what I wanted to say, and that's not what I have to say against you... But I don't know where I'm supposed to start, and what I'll be able to say is only the thousandth... oh, it's only the millionth part of what's on my mind about you! You've won a place in life, an honored position, and there you stand, coldly and consciously rejecting anything that might momentarily upset you and upset your balance, because balance is the most important thing to you. But it's not the most important thing, Thomas, it's not the most important thing before God! You are an egoist, yes you are! I still love you when you scold and act and thunder. But the worst is your silence, the worst is when, on something that has been said, you suddenly stop and withdraw and refuse all responsibility, noble and intact, leaving the others helpless to their embarrassment... You are so without pity and Love and humility , that poise and dignity... how sick to death!...' And that last cry was genuine to such a degree, it was so heartfelt, and erupted with such emphasis of repugnance and weariness, that there was actually something crushing about it, yes, that Thomas slumped a little and looked down in front of him for a while without a word and with a tired expression.","“I’m not going to die? Fine, I won’t die, then. Well, we’ll see which of us dies first! Work?—If only I could. But, good God in heaven, what if I can’t do steady work? I can’t do the same thing over and over for a long time without getting ill. And if you’ve been able to do it, still can do it, then be glad you can, but don’t sit in judgment— it’s not a virtue on your part. God gives the strength to some, and not to others. But that’s the way you are, Thomas,” he went on, still bent over the table, rapping it with his finger even more fiercely now, his face twisted into a grimace. “You’re self-righteous. Oh, but wait, that isn’t what I wanted to say , that isn’t what I want to reproach you for. I don’t even know where to begin, and anything I might say would only be a thousandth part—no, a millionth part—of what I have in my heart against you. You’ve won yourself a place in life, a position of honor, and now you stand here, so cold and self-assured, and reject anything that might confuse you for even a moment and throw you off balance. Because the most important thing for you is balance. But it’s not the most important thing, not before God! You’re an egotist, that’s what you are. I still can feel some love for you when you rant and rave and stamp your feet and thunder and put me down. But the worst thing is your silence, the worst thing is when you suddenly dry up after I’ve said something, you pull back, so elegant and unruffled, and refuse all responsibility, leaving the other fellow helpless in his shame. You’re a man without sympathy, love, or humility. Oh!” he suddenly cried, throwing his hands behind his head and then shoving them forward, as if to ward off the whole world. “I’ve had it up to here with all your tact and discretion and balance, with your poise and dignity—I’m sick to death of it.” And this last cry was so genuine, so heartfelt, and so emphatic in its disgust and weariness that it was indeed something of a crushing blow—and Thomas actually sank back a little and lowered his eyes for a while, speechless and spent.","""I shan't die? Very good, I shan't die, then. We'll see who dies first. Work! Suppose I can't work? My God! I can't do the same thing long at a time! It kills me.

But it isn't the most precious thing in life, Thomas--no, before God, it is not. You are an egotist, that is what you are. I am still fond of you, even when you are angry, and tread on me, and thunder me down. But when you get silent: when somebody says something and you are suddenly dumb, and withdraw your-self, quite elegant and remote, and repulse people like a wall and leave the other fellow to his shame, without any chance of justifying himself--! Yes, you are without pity, without love, without humility.--Dh,"" he cried, and stretched botr arms in front of him, palms outward, as though pushing eveiything away from him, ""Oh, how sick I am of all this tact and propriety, this poise and refinement--sick to death of it!"" The outburst was so genuine, so heart-felt, it sounded so full of loathing and satiety, that it was actually crushing, Thomas shrank a little and looked down in front of him, weary and without a word."
"Die Sache war die, daß der alte Herr auf Ida Jungmann nicht zum besten zu sprechen war. Er war kein beschränkter Kopf. Er hatte ein Stück von der Welt gesehen, war anno 13 vierspännig nach Süddeutschland gefahren, um als Heereslieferant für Preußen Getreide aufzukaufen, war in Amsterdam und Paris gewesen und hielt, ein aufgeklärter Mann, bei Gott nicht alles für verurteilenswürdig, was außerhalb der Tore seiner giebeligen Vaterstadt lag. Abgesehen vom geschäftlichen Verkehr aber, in gesellschaftlicher Beziehung, war er mehr als sein Sohn, der Konsul, geneigt, strenge Grenzen zu ziehen und Fremden ablehnend zu begegnen. Als daher eines Tages seine Kinder von einer Reise nach Westpreußen dies junge Mädchen – sie war erst jetzt zwanzig Jahre alt – als eine Art Jesuskind mit sich ins Haus gebracht hatten, eine Waise, die Tochter eines unmittelbar vor Ankunft der Buddenbrooks in Marienwerder verstorbenen Gasthofsbesitzers, da hatte der Konsul für diesen frommen Streich einen Auftritt mit seinem Vater zu bestehen gehabt, bei dem der alte Herr fast nur Französisch und Plattdeutsch sprach … Übrigens hatte Ida Jungmann sich als tüchtig im Hausstande und im Verkehr mit den Kindern erwiesen und eignete sich mit ihrer Loyalität und ihren preußischen Rangbegriffen im Grunde aufs beste für ihre Stellung in diesem Hause. Sie war eine Person von aristokratischen Grundsätzen, die haarscharf zwischen ersten und zweiten Kreisen, zwischen Mittelstand und geringerem Mittelstand unterschied, sie war stolz darauf, als ergebene Dienerin den ersten Kreisen anzugehören und sah es ungern, wenn Tony sich etwa mit einer Schulkameradin befreundete, die nach Mamsell Jungmanns Schätzung nur dem guten Mittelstande zuzurechnen war …","The thing was that the old gentleman couldn't be polite about Ida Jungmann. He was not a limited mind. He had seen a piece of the world, had driven four-in-hand to southern Germany in 13 to buy up grain as a supplier to the army for Prussia, had been to Amsterdam and Paris and, as an enlightened man, by God did not consider everything to be condemned outside the gates of his gabled hometown lay. Apart from business dealings, however, in social relations he was more inclined than his son, the consul, to draw strict boundaries and to treat strangers with refusal. So when one day his children from a trip to West Prussia brought this young girl - she was only now twenty years old - into the house as a kind of baby Jesus, an orphan, the daughter of an innkeeper who had died just before the Buddenbrooks arrived in Marienwerder, the consul had to pass an appearance with his father for this pious prank, during which the old gentleman spoke almost only French and Low German ... By the way, Ida Jungmann had proven to be competent in the household and dealing with the children and was suitable with her Loyalty and their Prussian notions of rank are basically best for their position in this house. She was a person of aristocratic principles, sharply distinguishing between first and second circles, middle class and lower middle class, proud to belong to the first circles as a devoted servant, and disliked Tony befriending, say, a schoolmate who according to Mamsell Jungmann's estimation, only belonged to the good middle class ...","As a matter of fact, the old gentleman had few good words for Ida Jungmann. He was not a narrow-minded man. He had seen a good piece of the world, had ridden in a coach-and-four to southern Germany to buy grain to supply the Prussian army in ’13, had been in Amsterdam and Paris, was a man of enlightened views, who, God knows, did not condemn everything beyond the gates and gables of his hometown. But apart from his business connections, he was more inclined than his son, the consul, to set strict limits to social relationships and to be standoffish with strangers. When, one day, then, his children returned from a trip to West Prussia with this young girl—she was only just twenty—bringing her into the house like some baby Jesus, an orphan, the daughter of an innkeeper who had died just before the Buddenbrooks’ arrival, the consul’s act of Christian charity had resulted in an outburst, during which the old gentleman spoke almost nothing but French and Plattdeutsch. All the same, Ida Jungmann had proved quite adept at housekeeping and dealing with children, and, given her Prussian sense of hierarchy and loyalty, was admirably suited for her position in the household. She was a woman of aristocratic principles, who differentiated very precisely between the first and second levels of society, between the middle class and the lower-middle class; she was proud to be the devoted servant of the first level, and showed her displeasure if Tony made friends with a schoolmate who, in Mamselle Jungmann’s estimation, was merely from a good middle-class family.","The truth was, the old gentleman hadn't a good word to say for Ida Jungmann. Not that he was narrow-minded. He had seen something of the world, having travelled by coach to Southern Germany in 1813 to buy up wheat for the Prussian army; he had been to Amsterdam and Paris, and was too en-lightened to condemn everything that lay beyond the gabled roofs of his native town. But in social intercourse he was more apt than his son to draw the line rigidly and give the cold shoulder to strangers. So when this young girl--she was then only twenty--had come back with his children from a visit to Western Prussia, as a sort of charity-child, the old man had made his son a scene for the act of piety, in which he spoke hardly anything but French and low German. Ida 7 was the daughter of an inn-keeper who had died just before the Buddenbrooks' arrival in Marienwerder. She had proved to be capable in the household and with the children, and her rigid honesty and Prussian notions of caste made her perfectly suited to her position in the family. She was a person of aristocratic principles, drawing hair-line distinctions be-tween class and class, and very proud of her position as servant of the higher orders. She objected to Tony's making friends with any schoolmate whom she reckoned as belonging only to the respectable middle class."

"Ihr Haß gegen diese »hergelaufene Familie« wurde durch die bloße Vorstellung genährt, daß die Hagenströms sich nun vielleicht berechtigt fühlen könnten, auf sie herabzusehen, und nicht minder durch das Glück, mit dem dies Geschlecht emporblühte. Der alte Hinrich starb zu Anfang des Jahres 51, und sein Sohn Hermann … Hermann mit den Zitronensemmeln und der Ohrfeige, führte nun an der Seite des Herrn Strunck das glänzend gehende Exportgeschäft fort und heiratete ein kurzes Jahr später die Tochter des Konsuls Huneus, des reichsten Mannes der Stadt, der es mit seinem Holzhandel dahin gebracht hatte, jedem seiner drei Kinder zwei Millionen hinterlassen zu können. Sein Bruder Moritz hatte trotz seiner Brustschwächlichkeit ein ungewöhnlich erfolgreiches Studium hinter sich und ließ sich in der Stadt als Rechtsgelehrter nieder. Er galt für einen hellen, schlauen, witzigen, ja sogar schöngeistigen Kopf und zog rasch eine beträchtliche Praxis an sich. Er hatte nichts Semlingersches in seinem Äußern, besaß aber ein gelbes Gesicht und spitzige, lückenhafte Zähne.","Her hatred of this ""stray family"" was fueled by the mere notion that the Hagenstroms might now feel entitled to look down on them, and no less by the fortune with which this lineage flourished.

Despite his weak chest, his brother Moritz had completed an unusually successful course of study and settled in the city as a legal scholar.

Old Hinrich had died at the beginning of 1851, and his son Hermann—Hermann with the lemon buns and the slaps—was now carrying on his father’s very profitable export business at the side of old Herr Strunck; and within a year he married the daughter of Consul Huneus, the richest man in town, whose wholesale lumber business had enabled him to leave each of his three children two million marks. Hermann’s brother, Moritz, had been an unusually successful student—despite his bad lungs—and established a law office in town. He was considered to be very astute and sly— indeed, to be a man of taste and wit—and he quickly built up a sizable practice. There was nothing of his Semlinger heritage about him, but he did have a yellow complexion and pointed gap-teeth.","Her hatred of the upstart family was fed by the mere thought that the Hagenstrb'ms might now feel justified in looking down on her-especially considering the present good fortune of the clan.

"Hanno war vollständig verwirrt. Bald nach dem Eintritt hatten seine fieberhaft suchenden Augen das Theater erblickt … ein Theater, das, wie es dort oben auf dem Tische prangte, von so extremer Größe und Breite erschien, wie er es sich vorzustellen niemals erkühnt hatte. Aber sein Platz hatte gewechselt, er befand sich an einer der vorjährigen entgegengesetzten Stelle, und dies bewirkte, daß Hanno in seiner Verblüffung ernstlich daran zweifelte, ob dies fabelhafte Theater für ihn bestimmt sei. Hinzu kam, daß zu den Füßen der Bühne, auf dem Boden, etwas Großes, Fremdes aufgestellt war, etwas, was nicht auf seinem Wunschzettel gestanden hatte, ein Möbel, ein kommodenartiger Gegenstand … war er für ihn?","Hanno was completely confused. Soon after entering, his feverishly searching eyes had caught sight of the theatre... a theatre, which, as it was emblazoned up there on the table, seemed of such extreme size and breadth as he had never dared to imagine. But his place had changed, he was in the opposite place from the previous year, and this caused Hanno, in his amazement, to seriously doubt whether this fabulous theater was meant for him. On top of that, at the foot of the stage, on the floor, was something large and strange, something that wasn't on his wish list, a piece of furniture, a dresser-like object... was it for him?","Hanno was completely confused now. The moment he entered the room, he had spotted the theater that his eyes were seeking so feverishly—there on the table, a splendid theater, looking much larger and grander than he had even dared imagine. But Hanno had ended up in a different place, directly across from where he had stood the year before, and this so disconcerted him that he seriously doubted whether that marvelous theater was really meant for him. Something else bothered him, too—sitting on the floor, right below the stage, was a large, strange object, something that he had not asked for. A piece of furniture, a kind of wardrobe, perhaps? Was that for him?","Hanno was quite dazed. His fevered glance had soon sought out the theatre, which, as it stood there upon the table, seemed larger and grander than anything he had dared to dream of. But his place had been changed--it was now opposite to where he had stood last year, and this made him doubtful whether the theatre was really his. And on the floor beneath it was something else, a large, mysterious some-thing, which had surely not been on his list; a piece of fur-141 BUDDENBRDOKS niture, that looked like a commode--could it be meant for him?"
"Und sie erwiderte ihm: »Thomas, ein für allemal, von der Musik als Kunst wirst du niemals etwas verstehen, und so intelligent du bist, wirst du niemals einsehen, daß sie mehr ist als ein kleiner Nachtischspaß und Ohrenschmaus. In der Musik geht dir der Sinn für das Banale ab, der dir doch sonst nicht fehlt … und er ist das Kriterium des Verständnisses in der Kunst. Wie fremd dir die Musik ist, kannst du schon daraus ersehen, daß dein musikalischer Geschmack deinen übrigen Bedürfnissen und Anschauungen ja eigentlich gar nicht entspricht. Was freut dich in der Musik? Der Geist eines gewissen faden Optimismus, den du, wäre er in einem Buche eingeschlossen, empört oder ärgerlich belustigt in die Ecke werfen würdest. Schnelle Erfüllung jedes kaum erregten Wunsches … Prompte, freundliche Befriedigung des kaum ein wenig aufgestachelten Willens … Geht es in der Welt etwa zu wie in einer hübschen Melodie?… Das ist läppischer Idealismus …«","And she said to him, 'Thomas, once and for all, you'll never understand music as an art, and intelligent as you are, you'll never see that it's anything more than a little dessert fun and a feast for the ears. In music you lack the sense of the banal that you otherwise don't lack... and it is the criterion of understanding in art. You can see how alien music is to you from the fact that your musical taste doesn't really correspond to your other needs and views. What makes you happy in music? The spirit of a certain insipid optimism which, if locked up in a book, you would toss aside in disgust or irritably amused. Swift fulfillment of every scarcely aroused wish... Prompt, friendly gratification of the scarcely a little stimulated will... Does the world go on as in a pretty tune?... That's silly idealism...""","And she replied, “Thomas, let me say once and for all that you will never understand music as art, and, as intelligent as you are, you will never see it as anything more than a little after-dinner treat, dessert for your ears. When it comes to music, your normally fine sense for what is banal fails you entirely. And that is the criterion for understanding art. You can see just how foreign music is to you by the fact that your musical understanding does not at all correspond to your usual demands and tastes. What kind of music do you enjoy? Things that have a certain insipid optimism, which, if you found them in a book, would prompt you to cast it with amused anger or total outrage into the nearest corner. The quick gratification of every vaguely aroused wish—prompt, cordial satisfaction before the will has even been engaged. Is that how the world works—like a pretty melody? That’s merely flimsy idealism.”","To which she rejoined: 'Thomas, once for all, you will never understand anything about music as an art, and, intelligent as you are, you will never see that it is more than an after-dinner pleasure and a feast for the ears. In every other field you have a perception of the banal--in music not. But it is the test of musical compre-hension. What pleases you in music? A sort of insipid optimism, which, if you met with it in literature, would make you throw down the book with an angry or sarcastic comment. Easy gratification of each unformed wish, prompt saLisJaction before the will is even roused--that is what pretty music is like--and it is like nothing else in the world.

"Gerda Buddenbrook und der junge, eigenartige Offizier hatten einander, wie sich versteht, auf dem Gebiete der Musik gefunden. Herr von Throta spielte Klavier, Geige, Bratsche, Violoncell und Flöte – alles vortrefflich – und oft ward dem Senator der kommende Besuch im voraus angekündigt, dadurch, daß Herr von Throtas Bursche, den Cellokasten auf dem Rücken schleppend, an den grünen Fenstervorsätzen des Privatkontors vorüberging und im Hause verschwand … Dann saß Thomas Buddenbrook an seinem Schreibtisch und wartete, bis er auch ihn selbst, den Freund seiner Frau, in sein Haus eintreten sah, bis über ihm im Salon die Harmonien aufwogten, die unter Singen, Klagen und übermenschlichem Jubeln gleichsam mit krampfhaft ausgestreckten, gefalteten Händen emporrangen und nach allen irren und vagen Ekstasen in Schwäche und Schluchzen hinsanken in Nacht und Schweigen. Mochten sie doch rollen und brausen, weinen und jauchzen, einander aufschäumend umschlingen und sich so übernatürlich gebärden wie sie nur wollten! Das Schlimme, das eigentlich Qualvolle war die Lautlosigkeit, die ihnen folgte, die dann dort oben im Salon so lange, lange herrschte, und die zu tief und unbelebt war, um nicht Grauen zu erregen. Kein Schritt erschütterte die Decke, kein Stuhl ward gerückt; es war eine unlautere, hinterhältige, schweigende, verschweigende Stille … Dann saß Thomas Buddenbrook und ängstigte sich so sehr, daß er manchmal leise ächzte.","It goes without saying that Gerda Buddenbrook and the young, peculiar officer had found each other in the field of music. Herr von Throta played the piano, violin, viola, violoncello and flute - all excellently - and the Senator was often informed of the coming visit in advance by Herr von Throta's boy, dragging the cello case on his back, at the green sills of the private office passed by and disappeared into the house... Then Thomas Buddenbrook sat at his desk and waited until he also saw himself, his wife's friend, enter his house, until the harmonies surged above him in the drawing room, with singing, lamentations and superhuman rejoicing raised up, as it were, with convulsively outstretched, folded hands and, after all the mad and vague ecstasies in weakness and sobs, sank into night and silence. May they roll and roar, weep and rejoice, embrace each other in effervescence and behave as supernaturally as they please! The bad thing, the really painful thing, was the silence that followed them, which then reigned for so long, up there in the drawing room, and which was too deep and inanimate not to arouse horror. Not a step shook the ceiling, not a chair was moved; it was an unfair, insidious, silent, taciturn silence... Then Thomas Buddenbrook sat and was so frightened that he sometimes groaned softly.","Gerda Buddenbrook and the young, eccentric officer had become acquainted, naturally, by way of music. Herr von Throta played the piano, violin, viola, cello, and flute—all exceedingly well—and often the senator did not realize a visit was impending until he saw Herr von Throta’s aide, a cello case on his back, pass by the green windowsill outside his private office and vanish into the house. Then Thomas Buddenbrook would sit at his desk and wait until he saw the man himself, his wife’s friend, enter the house, until he heard the harmonious strains swell in the salon above him—lilting, lamenting melodies or superhuman exultations raised heavenward like clasped hands. After wandering in confusion and vague ecstasy, the sounds would then sink back down, sobbing and fainting, into night and stillness. But no matter, let them surge and bluster, weep and exult, sparkle and embrace in supernatural pantomime. The worst thing, the truly tormenting part, was the silence afterward, which reigned above him in the salon for such a long, long time and was too profound and inert not to fill him with dread. There were no footsteps to shake the ceiling, not even a chair scraped as it moved; it was a sordid, insidious, hushed, secret silence. Then Thomas Buddenbrook would sit there so terrified that he sometimes moaned softly.","Gerda Buddenbrook and the eccentric young officer met each other, naturally, in the world of music.

"Tony bezog mit Erika im zweiten Stockwerk die Zimmer, die ehemals, zur Zeit der alten Buddenbrooks, ihre Eltern innegehabt hatten. Sie war ein wenig enttäuscht, als ihr Papa es sich keineswegs in den Sinn kommen ließ, ein eignes Dienstmädchen für sie zu engagieren, und sie durchlebte eine nachdenkliche halbe Stunde, als er ihr mit sanften Worten auseinandersetzte, es zieme sich vorderhand nichts anderes für sie, als in Zurückgezogenheit zu leben und auf die Geselligkeit in der Stadt zu verzichten, denn wenn sie auch an dem Geschick, das Gott als Prüfung über sie verhängt, nach menschlichen Begriffen unschuldig sei, so lege doch ihre Stellung als geschiedene Frau ihr fürs erste die äußerste Zurückhaltung auf. Aber Tony besaß die schöne Gabe, sich jeder Lebenslage mit Talent, Gewandtheit und lebhafter Freude am Neuen anzupassen. Sie gefiel sich bald in ihrer Rolle als eine von unverschuldetem Unglück heimgesuchte Frau, kleidete sich dunkel, trug ihr hübsches aschblondes Haar glatt gescheitelt wie als junges Mädchen und hielt sich für die mangelnde Geselligkeit schadlos, indem sie zu Hause mit ungeheurer Wichtigkeit und unermüdlicher Freude an dem Ernst und der Bedeutsamkeit ihrer Lage Betrachtungen über ihre Ehe, über Herrn Grünlich und über Leben und Schicksal im allgemeinen anstellte.","Tony and Erika moved into the room on the second floor that their parents had occupied in the days of the old Buddenbrooks. She was a little disappointed when her papa would not entertain the thought of hiring a maid of his own, and she lived through a thoughtful half-hour as he explained in gentle words that for the time being nothing else befitted her than to live in seclusion and renounce the sociability of the city, for even if she is innocent in human terms of the fate that God ordains upon her as a test, her position as a divorced woman puts her first of all extreme restraint. But Tony had the beautiful gift of adapting to every situation with talent, dexterity, and a keen interest in new things. She soon found herself in her role as a woman stricken with misfortune through no fault of her own, dressed darkly, wore her pretty ash-blond hair parted smoothly as she had when she was a young girl, and made up for her lack of sociability by staying at home with immense importance and tireless joy the seriousness and importance of her situation, made reflections on her marriage, on Herr Grünlich and on life and destiny in general.","Tony moved into the rooms on the third floor that her parents had occupied when the old Buddenbrooks were alive. She was somewhat disappointed when her papa would not hear of hiring a separate maid for them; and she spent a half-hour in pensive reflection the day he gently explained to her that her only proper course of action for now was to live a private life apart from the social whirl of the town, for, although by all ordinary standards she was an innocent victim of the fate that God had sent to test her, her position as a divorced woman demanded the greatest discretion at present. But Tony had the lovely knack of being able to adapt readily to any situation in life simply by tackling its new possibilities. She was soon enjoying her role of “innocent woman afflicted by tragedy”; her wardrobe was dark now, her pretty ash-blond hair was parted and neatly drawn back, just as she had worn it in her youth; and, to compensate for her lack of social pleasures, she found inexhaustible joy and great dignity in the gravity and importance of her new situation and provided the household with her views on marriage, Herr Grünlich, and life and destiny in general.","Tony had moved with Erica into the rooms in the second storey which her parents had occupied in the time of the elder Buddenbrooks. She was a little disappointed to find that it did not occur to her Papa to engage a servant for her, and she had rather a pensive half-hour when he gently explained that it would be fitting for her to live a retired life and give up the society of the town: for though, he said, according to human judgments she was an innocent victim of the fate which God had sent to try her, still her position as a divorced wife made a very quiet life advisable, particularly at first. But Tony possessed the gift of adaptability. She could ad-just herself with ease and cheerfulness to any situation. She soon grew charmed with her role of the injured wife returned to the house of her fathers; wore dark frocks, dressed her ash-blonde hair primly like a young girl's, and felt richly repaid for her lack of society by the weight she had acquired in the household, the seriousness and dignity of her new position, and above all by the immense pleasure of being able to talk about Herr Grunlich and her marriage and to moke general observations about life and destiny, which she did with the utmost gusto."

Am Donnerstag die arme Klothilde zu verhöhnen, bereitete wenig Genugtuung, und über Christian, der durch Vermittlung Mr. Richardsons, seines ehemaligen Prinzipals, in London eine Stellung gefunden und von dort aus ganz kürzlich den aberwitzigen Wunsch herübertelegraphiert hatte, Fräulein Puvogel als Gattin sich zu nehmen, worauf er allerdings von der Konsulin aufs strengste zurückgewiesen war … über Christian, der ganz einfach zur Rangordnung Jakob Krögers gehörte, waren die Akten geschlossen. So entschädigte man sich ein wenig an den kleinen Schwächen der Konsulin und Frau Permaneders, indem man zum Beispiel das Gespräch auf Haartrachten brachte; denn die Konsulin war imstande, mit der sanftesten Miene zu sagen, sie trage »ihr« Haar schlicht … während doch alle von Gott mit Verstand begabten Menschen, vor allen aber die Damen Buddenbrook sich sagen mußten, daß der unveränderlich rötlichblonde Scheitel unter der Haube der alten Dame längst nicht mehr »ihr« Haar genannt werden könne. Noch lohnender aber war es, Kusine Tony zu veranlassen, sich ein wenig über die Personen zu äußern, die ihr bisheriges Leben in hassenswerter Weise beeinflußt hatten. Tränen-Trieschke! Grünlich! Permaneder! Hagenströms!… Diese Namen, die Tony, wenn sie gereizt ward, wie ebenso viele kleine Trompetenstöße des Abscheus mit etwas emporgezogenen Schultern in die Luft hinein verlauten ließ, klangen den Töchtern Onkel Gottholds recht angenehm in die Ohren.","Truly, the aging girls found too little distraction from the sight of the striking upswing that Thomas's outward life was taking. To mock poor Klothilde on Thursday brought little satisfaction, and about Christian, who had found a position in London through the agency of Mr. Richardson, his former principal, and had recently telegraphed the ludicrous wish to marry Miss Puvogel to which he was strictly rejected by the consul ... the files on Christian, who quite simply belonged to Jakob Kröger's hierarchy, were closed. So they made up for the small weaknesses of the Consul and Frau Permaneders, for example by bringing the conversation to the topic of hairstyles; for the Consul was able to say, with the gentlest air, that she wore ""her"" hair plain old lady could no longer be called ""her"" hair. Even more rewarding was getting Cousin Tony to say a little about the people who had hated her life up to that point. Tear Trieschke! Greenish! permaneder! Hagenstroms!... These names, which Tony, when irritated, like so many little trumpets of disgust, with somewhat hunched shoulders, uttered in the air, sounded quite pleasant in the ears of Uncle Gotthold's daughters.","These aging spinsters found all too few distractions to help them over the sensational upswing that Thomas’s life had taken. There was little satisfaction in mocking poor Klothilde on Thursdays, and as for Christian, he was simply another Jakob Kröger in their eyes. They knew that he had found a job in London with his former boss, Mr. Richardson, and that recently he had sent a telegram containing the absurd wish to make Fräulein Aline Puvogel his wife, which had met with the sternest rebuff from Madame Buddenbrook. His case, then, was closed. And so they found what compensation they could in the foibles of old Madame Buddenbrook and Frau Permaneder—by turning the conversation to hairdos, for instance; because Elisabeth was perfectly capable of saying, with the most gentle look on her face, that she wore “her” hair quite simply—when any person whom God had endowed with intelligence, and above all the Ladies Buddenbrook, would have to admit that for many years now it had been impossible to call that unchanging reddish blond swatch under the old woman’s bonnet “her” hair. But it was even more rewarding to induce Cousin Tony to say something about those persons who had had such an odious influence on her life thus far. Teary Trieschke! Grünlich! Permaneder! The Hagenströms! When provoked, Tony would raise her shoulder slightly and release those names into the air like so many little trumpet blasts, much to the delight of Uncle Gotthold’s daughters.","These aging spinsters felt that all too little shadow set off the sunshine through which Thomas's outward life ran its brilliant course. It was no great consolation--at the Thurs-day family gatherings--to pour contempt on poor, good-natured Clothilde. As for Christian--Christian, through the good office of Mr. Rirhardson, his former chief, had found a situation in London, whence he had lately telegraphed a fantastic desire to marry Fraulein Puvogel, an idea upon which his mother had firmly set her foot-- Christian now be-longed, quite simply, to Jacob Krbger's class, and was, as it were, a dead issue. They consoled themselves, to some extent, with the little weaknesses of the old Frau Consul and Frau Permaneder. They would bring the conversation round to the subject of coiffures: the Frau Consul was capable of saying, in the blandest way, that she always wore ""her"" hair very simply, whereas it was plain to any one gifted by God with intelligence, and certainly to the Misses Buddenbrook, that the immutable red-blonde hair under the old lady's cap could no longer by any stretch be called ""her"" hair. Still more gratifying was it to get Cousin Tony started on the subject of those nefarious persons who had formerly had an influence on her life. Teary Trietschke! Gr�nlich! Permaneder! Hagenstrb'm!--Tony, when she was egged on to it, would utter these names into the air like so many little trumpet ings of disgust, with her shoulders well up. They had a sweet sound in the ears of the daughters of Uncle Gotthold."

"Thomas war sechzehnjährig, als er die Schule verließ. Er war stark gewachsen in letzter Zeit und trug seit seiner Konfirmation, bei der Pastor Kölling ihm mit starken Ausdrücken Mäßigkeit! empfohlen hatte, ganz herrenmäßige Kleidung, die ihn noch größer erscheinen ließ. Um seinen Hals hing die lange goldene Uhrkette, die der Großvater ihm zugesprochen hatte, und an der ein Medaillon mit dem Wappen der Familie hing, diesem melancholischen Wappenschilde, das eine unregelmäßig schraffierte Fläche, ein flaches Moorland mit einer einsamen und nackten Weide am Ufer zeigte. Der noch ältere Siegelring mit grünem Stein, den wahrscheinlich schon der sehr gut situierte Gewandschneider in Rostock getragen hatte, war nebst der großen Bibel auf den Konsul übergegangen.","Thomas was sixteen when he left school. He had grown a lot lately and had been wearing temperance since his confirmation, when Pastor Kölling used strong expressions to describe him. had recommended, very manly clothes that made him appear even taller. Around his neck hung the long gold watch chain which his grandfather had promised him, and on which hung a medallion with the family coat of arms, that melancholy coat of arms showing an irregularly hatched area, a flat moorland with a solitary and bare willow on the bank . The even older signet ring with a green stone, which the well-to-do tailor in Rostock had probably already worn, had passed to the consul along with the large Bible.","Thomas was sixteen years old when he left school. He had grown a great deal in the last few years, and ever since his confirmation by Pastor Kölling, who had strongly urged him to be “temperate in all things,” he had worn men’s clothes, which made him look even taller. Around his neck hung the long gold watch chain that his grandfather had promised him, its fob a medallion that displayed the rather mournful family coat-of-arms: an irregularly hatched background, a bleak moor landscape, and a solitary, leafless willow beside a marsh. The signet ring with a green gemstone was even older, had presumably been worn by the very well-situated merchant tailor from Rostock, and the consul had inherited it along with the large Bible.","Thomas had left school at sixteen. He was grown strong and sturdy, and his manly clothes made him look still older. He had been confirmed, and Pastor K�lling, in stentorian tones, had enjoined upon him to practice the virtues of moder-ation.

"Wenn überhaupt das Verhältnis der beiden Buddenbrooks zueinander mit der Zeit sich nicht zum Guten gestaltete, so war Christian dabei nicht derjenige, der es sich beifallen ließ, irgendwelche Gehässigkeit gegen seinen Bruder zu zeigen oder zu hegen, sich irgendeine Meinung, ein Urteil, eine Abschätzung desselben anzumaßen. Er ließ mit stillschweigender Selbstverständlichkeit keinen Zweifel darüber, daß er die Überlegenheit, den größeren Ernst, die größere Fähigkeit, Tüchtigkeit und Respektabilität des Älteren anerkannte. Aber gerade diese unbegrenzte, gleichgültige und kampflose Unterordnung reizte Thomas, denn Christian ging bei jeder Gelegenheit leichten Herzens so weit darin, daß es den Anschein gewann, als lege er überhaupt gar keinen Wert auf Überlegenheit, Tüchtigkeit, Respektabilität und Ernst.","If the relationship between the two Buddenbrooks did not turn out well over time, Christian was not the one who allowed himself to show or harbor any spite against his brother, to form any opinion, a judgment, an assessment to presume the same. With tacit self-evidence he left no doubt that he recognized the superiority, greater seriousness, greater ability, efficiency, and respectability of the older man. But it was precisely this unlimited, indifferent, and unfighting submission that appealed to Thomas, for Christian went so far in it at every opportunity with a light heart that it seemed as if he didn't value superiority, efficiency, respectability, and seriousness at all.","And if over time the relationship between the two Buddenbrooks did not turn out all that well , Christian was not the one to whom it would have occurred to feel or show any sort of malice toward his brother, to presume to judge him, or even to form a critical opinion about him. In his silent matter-of-factness, he left no doubt that he recognized his elder brother’s superiority, his greater expertise, competence, and respectability. But it was just such unbounded, nonchalant, peaceable subordination that annoyed Thomas, because on any given occasion Christian was so blithely docile that it appeared as if he set no value whatever in superiority, competence, seriousness, or respectability.","But if in time the relations between the two brothers came to be not of the best, Christian was not the one who thought of showing or feeling any animosity against his brother.

"Dennoch gab der Senator sich nicht zufrieden. Er sprach über die vortreffliche Teilbarkeit des Grundstückes, betonte die Verantwortung, die er seinen Geschwistern gegenüber trage, und beharrte bei dem Preise von 30000 Talern Kurant, um dann aufs neue mit einem Gemisch von Nervosität und Wohlgefallen eine wohlpointierte Entgegnung des Herrn Gosch anzuhören. Das dauerte wohl zwei Stunden lang, in deren Verlaufe Herr Gosch Gelegenheit hatte, alle Register seiner Charakterkunst zu ziehen.

Die in Frankfurt hatten nur Geschenke geschickt, denn die Reise war doch zu umständlich … An ihrer Stelle aber waren, als einzige, die nicht der Familie zugehörten, Doktor Grabow, der Hausarzt, und Mamsell Weichbrodt, Tonys mütterliche Freundin, zugegen – Sesemi Weichbrodt mit ganz neuen grünen Haubenbändern über den Seitenlocken und einem schwarzen Kleidchen. »Sei glöcklich, du gutes Kind!« sagte sie, als Tony an Herrn Grünlichs Seite in der Säulenhalle erschien, reckte sich empor und küßte sie mit leise knallendem Geräusch auf die Stirn. – Die Familie war zufrieden mit der Braut; Tony sah hübsch, unbefangen und heiter aus, wenn auch ein wenig blaß vor Neugier und Reisefieber.","Up in the columned hall, because that was where the wedding ceremony was to take place, the family had gathered - a stately company!

Dr. Crabow, the family physician, and Mile. Weichbrodt, Tony's motherly friend--Sesemi Weichbrodt, with fresh ribbons on her cap over the side curls, and a little black dress. "" Be happy, you good child,"" she said, when Tony appeared at Herr Gr�nlich's BUDDENBRODKS side in the hall. She reached up and kissed her with a little explosion on the forehead. The family was satisfied with the bride: Tony looked pretty, gay, and at her ease, if a little pale from excitement and tension."

"Hanno war schlankgliedrig und ziemlich lang für sein Alter. Sein hellbraunes, sehr weiches Haar begann in dieser Zeit ungemein schnell zu wachsen und fiel bald, kaum merklich gewellt, auf die Schultern seines faltigen, schürzenartigen Kleidchens nieder. Schon begannen die Familienähnlichkeiten sich vollkommen erkennbar bei ihm auszuprägen. Von Anbeginn besaß er ganz ausgesprochen die Hände der Buddenbrooks: breit, ein wenig zu kurz, aber fein gegliedert; und seine Nase war genau die seines Vaters und Urgroßvaters, wenn auch die Flügel noch zarter bleiben zu wollen schienen. Das ganze längliche und schmale Untergesicht jedoch gehörte weder den Buddenbrooks noch den Krögers, sondern der mütterlichen Familie – wie auch vor allem sein Mund, der frühzeitig – schon jetzt – dazu neigte, sich in zugleich wehmütiger und ängstlicher Weise verschlossen zu halten … mit diesem Ausdruck, dem später der Blick seiner eigenartig goldbraunen Augen mit den bläulichen Schatten sich immer mehr anpaßte …","Hanno was slim and quite tall for his age. During this time his light brown, very soft hair began to grow extremely quickly and soon fell, hardly noticeably wavy, onto the shoulders of his wrinkled, apron-like dress. The family resemblances were already beginning to manifest themselves in him in a completely recognizable way. From the start he had the hands of the Buddenbrooks quite distinctly: broad, a little too short, but finely articulated; and his nose was exactly that of his father and great-grandfather, although the wings seemed to want to remain even more delicate. The entire long, narrow lower face, however, belonged neither to the Buddenbrooks nor to the Krögers, but to the maternal family – as did, above all, his mouth, which early on – even now – tended to remain closed in a way that was both melancholic and anxious … with this expression , to which later the gaze of his peculiar golden-brown eyes with the bluish shadows more and more adapted...","Hanno had slender limbs and was rather tall for his age. His light brown hair was very soft and began to grow uncommonly fast at about this same time; very soon it fell in gentle waves down onto the shoulders of his pleated, pinaforelike dress. Facial traits began to take definitive shape, and the family resemblances grew noticeable. From the very beginning, his hands had definitely been Buddenbrook hands: broad, a little short, but with delicate fingers; and his nose was definitely that of his father and great-grandfather, though it appeared the nostrils would flair somewhat more softly. The lower part of the face, however, was long and narrow and was neither Buddenbrook nor Kröger, but most decidedly belonged to his mother’s side of the family. As did the mouth, which even now, at this early stage, he tended to hold closed, so that the expression was somehow both melancholy and apprehensive, and gradually this came to be matched by the look in his peculiar golden-brown eyes with their bluish shadows.","The child was slender of limb, and rather tall for his age. His hair, pale brown and very soft, began to grow rapidly, and fell waving over the shoulders of his full, pinafore-like frocks. The family likenesses wrre abundantly clear, even now. From the first he possessed the Eudden-brook hand, broad, a little too short, but finely articulated, and his nose was precisely the nose of his father and great-grandfather, though the nostrils would probably remain more delicate. But the whole lower part of his face, longish and narrow, was neither Buddenbrook nor Kroner, but from the mother's side of the house. This was true of the mouth in particular, which, when closed, began very early tn wear an anxious, woebegone expression that later matched the look of his strange, gold-brown, blue-shadowed eyes."

"»Fein? Ha, nein, das ist die einfachste Erfahrung, die das Leben mich gelehrt hat. Aber laß es gut sein, Tom. Ich will nicht in dich dringen. Kann ich dich zu einer solchen Sache überreden? Nein, dazu fehlen mir die Kenntnisse. Ich bin bloß ein dummes Ding … Schade … Nun, gleichviel. Es hat mich sehr interessiert.

Er hat hie und da Geld verloren, die Zeiten sind schlecht, und das grade jetzt, da meine Lage sich eben wieder durch Gottes Güte verbessert hat und ich mich glücklich fühle.

Ha, no, this is the simplest experience life has taught me. But let it be, Tom. I don't want to penetrate you. Can I persuade you to do such a thing? No, I don't have the knowledge for that. I'm just a stupid thing... Too bad... Well, never mind. I was very interested in it. On the one hand I was shocked and saddened for Maibooms, but on the other hand I was happy for you. I thought to myself: Tom has been walking around a little joylessly for some time. He used to complain, and now he doesn't even complain anymore. He's lost money here and there, times are bad, and that's just now when my situation has just improved again through God's goodness and I feel happy. And then I thought to myself: This is something for him, a coup, a good catch. With this he can smooth out many a blemish and show people that the Johann Buddenbrook company has not yet completely lost its luck. And if you had agreed, I would have been very proud to have mediated the matter, because you know that it has always been my dream and my longing to be of service to our name... Enough... well, the question is settled now . - But what annoys me is the thought that Maiboom still has to sell on the stalk, Tom, and if he looks around here in the city, he'll find buyers... he'll find one... and that will be Hermann Hagenstrom, ha, the rogue…”","“Nice? No, it’s the most basic lesson that life has taught me. But never mind, Tom. I don’t wish to press you. Can I convince you to enter into such a transaction? No, I lack the expertise for that. I’m just a silly goose. What a shame. Well, no matter. It simply interested me very much. On the one hand, I was shocked, of course, and felt sorry for Maiboom, but on the other, I was glad for you. I thought, Tom’s been wandering about rather glumly for quite a while now. He used to complain, but he doesn’t even complain anymore. He lost some money here and there, and these are hard times—just when my situation has improved again, thank God, and I’m feeling so happy. And then I thought: This would be something for him, a coup, a profitable deal. This will allow him to make up for many a setback and show people that good luck hasn’t quite deserted the firm of Johann Buddenbrook yet. And if you had picked up on it, I would have been very proud to have been the middleman, because you know it’s always been my dream, my fondest hope, to be of some use to the family name. But enough, that takes care of it, I suppose. Though what really annoys me is the thought that Maiboom is going to have to sell his entire crop in any case, Tom, and if he should look around town here for a buyer, he’s sure to find one. He’s sure to find one, and his name will be Hermann Hagenström—the scoundrel.”","""Fine? No, it's very simple--one of the simplest things life has taught me. But let it go, Tom. I won't urge you. Don't imagine that I think I could persuade you-- I know I don't know enough. I'm only a silly female. It's a pity. Well, never mind.--It interested me very much. On the one hand I was shocked and upset about the Maibooms, but on the other I was pleased for you. I said to myself: 'Tom has been going about lately feeling very down in the mouth. He used to complain, but now he does not even complain any more. He has been losing money, and times are poor--and all that just now, when God has been good to me, and I am feeling happier than I have for a long time.' So I thought, This would be something for him: a stroke of luck, a good coup. It would offset a good deal of misfortune, and show people that luck is still on the side of the firm of Johann Buddenbrook.' And if you had undertaken it, I should have been so proud to have been the means-- for you know it has always been my dream and my one desire, to be of some good to the family name.--Well, never mind. It is settled now.

"Herr Grünlich saß stumm, steif, fassungslos, und sein Mund bewegte sich ruckweise nach beiden Seiten, ohne daß sich ihm ein Wort zu entringen vermochte. Herrn Kesselmeyers Munterkeit aber kehrte bei dieser abschließenden und endgültigen Bewegung des Konsuls zurück … ja, sie nahm überhand, sie überschritt alle Grenzen und wurde fürchterlich! Das Binokel fiel von seiner Nase, die sich zwischen die Augen hinaufzog, während sein winziger Mund, in dem die beiden Eckzähne gelb und einsam ragten, zu zerreißen drohte. Seine kleinen, roten Hände ruderten in der Luft, seine Flaumfedern flatterten, sein gänzlich verschobenes und vor übermäßiger Fröhlichkeit verzerrtes Gesicht mit dem weißen, geschorenen Backenbart war zinnoberfarben …","Herr Grünlich sat silent, stiff, stunned, and his mouth moved jerkily in both directions without being able to get a word out of him.

The binoculars fell from his nose, which stretched up between his eyes, while his tiny mouth, in which the two canines jutted yellow and lonely, threatened to tear. His small, red hands flailed in the air, his downy feathers fluttered, his face, utterly distorted and contorted with excessive happiness, with its white, clipped whiskers, was vermilion...","Herr Grünlich sat there silent, stiff, bewildered— his mouth twitched from side to side, but he was unable to wrench a single word from it. But with this final and conclusive action by the consul, Herr Kesselmeyer’s good cheer returned—indeed, it grew more intense and dreadful, until it burst all bounds. His pince-nez fell from his nose, which lurched upward between his eyes, and his tiny mouth, distorted by those two lonely yellow canines, threatened to rip apart. His little red hands rowed in the air, the down on his skull fluttered; and, framed by his white, close-cropped beard, his whole face, twisted and deformed by this excess of mirth, turned vermilion.","Herr Gr�nlich sat silent, stiff, irresolute; his mouth opened and closed without a word coming out. But the sprightliness of Herr Kesselmeyer returned at this conclusive action of the Consul. Yes, it got the upper hand entirely, it passed all bounds, it became frightful. The glasses fell from his nose, which went skyward, while his little mouth, with the two triangular yellow teeth, looked as though it were splitting. He rowed with his little red hands in the air, the fuzz on his head waved up and down, his whole face, with its bristly white beard distorted and grotesque with uncontrolled hilarity--had grown the colour of cinnamon."

He told of Venice, Rome, arid Vesuvius, of the Villa Borghese, where Goethe had written part of his Faust; he waxed enthusiastic over the beautiful Renaissance fountains that wafted coolness upon the warm Italian air, and the formal gardens through the avenues of which it was so enchanting to stroll. Some one mentioned the big wilder-ness of a garden outside the Castle Gate, that belonged to the Buddenbrooks."
"Er richtete sich auf und entzündete die Kerze auf dem Nachttische.

"Er mußte sich einen Augenblick besinnen, ob er es getan habe, und dann sagte er schüchtern und ängstlich: »Ja.« »Was heißt das! Was ficht dich an! Antworte!

"Nicht wahr? denkt die Dame. Ja, Gott sei Dank, es hat gewirkt!… Sie zuckt zusammen. Ein neues Gerücht ist herausgedrungen, läuft im Zick-Zack nach hinten und gelangt zu ihr. Die allgemeine Wahl hat keine Entscheidung gebracht. Eduard Kistenmaker, der die wenigsten Stimmen erhalten, ist ausrangiert worden. Der Kampf zwischen Hagenström und Buddenbrook dauert fort.

But the struggle goes on between Buddenbrook and Hagen-strbm. A sapient citizen remarks that if the voting continues to be even, it will be necessary to appoint five arbitrators."
"Hätte Senator Buddenbrook zwei Söhne besessen, so hätte er den Jüngeren ohne Frage das Gymnasium absolvieren und studieren lassen. Aber die Firma verlangte einen Erben, und abgesehen hiervon glaubte er dem Kleinen eine Wohltat zu erweisen, wenn er ihn der unnötigen Mühen mit dem Griechischen überhob. Er war der Meinung, daß das Realpensum leichter zu bewältigen sei, und daß Hanno, mit seiner oft schwerfälligen Auffassung, seiner träumerischen Unaufmerksamkeit und seiner körperlichen Zartheit, die ihn allzuoft nötigte, die Schule zu versäumen, in den Realklassen ohne Überanstrengung schneller und ehrenvoller vorwärts kommen werde. Sollte der kleine Johann Buddenbrook einstmals das leisten, wozu er berufen war und was die Seinen von ihm erhofften, so mußte man vor allem darauf bedacht sein, seine nicht eben kräftige Konstitution durch Rücksichtnahme einerseits und durch rationelle Pflege und Abhärtung andererseits zu festigen und zu heben …","If Senator Buddenbrook had had two sons, there is no question that he would have let the younger one finish high school and study. But the company wanted an heir, and apart from that he thought it would be a good thing for the little one to save him from unnecessary trouble with Greek. He was of the opinion that the real workload was easier to cope with and that Hanno, with his often sluggish mind, his dreamy inattention and his physical tenderness, which all too often forced him to miss school, could progress faster and more honorably in the real classes without overexertion will come. If little Johann Buddenbrook should one day achieve what he was called to do and what his family hoped for from him, one had above all to ensure that his constitution, which was not exactly strong, was strengthened and raised through consideration on the one hand and through rational care and hardening on the other ...","If Senator Buddenbrook had had two sons, he doubtless would have let the younger graduate in the classics and go on to university. But the firm needed an heir; and besides, he believed he was doing the lad a favor by sparing him the unnecessary agony of Greek. He was of the opinion that the modern curriculum was easier to master and that, given Hanno’s difficulties in concentrating, his dreamy inattention, and his delicate health, which all too often meant that he had to miss school, the boy would be able to make faster and more creditable progress there. And if little Johann Buddenbrook was ever to accomplish what life had called him to do and the senator expected of him, they must above all give attention to strengthening and enhancing his less-than-robust constitution, first by taking necessary precautions, and second by a program for systematically toughening his mettle.","If the Senator had had two sons, he would assuredly have allowed the second to go through the gymnasium and study. But the firm demanded a successor. And, besides, he was convinced he was doing the boy a kindness in relieving him of the unnecessary Greek. He was of opinion that the mer-cantile course was the easier to master, and that Hanno would therefore come through with greater credit and less strain if he took it, considering his defects--his slowness of compre-hension, his absent, dreaming ways, and his physical delicacy, which often obliged him to be absent from. school. If little Johann Buddenbrook were to achieve the position in life to which he was called, they must be mindful before everything else, by care and cherishing on the one hand, by sensible toughening on the other, to strengthen his far from robust constitution."

"Und wahrhaftig entwickelte sich die Angelegenheit mit großer Präzision. An einem warmen und wolkenlosen Julinachmittag machte die Familie einen Spaziergang.

"Nicht genug der Veränderungen! Mamsell Jungmann, Ida Jungmann, seit vierzig Jahren im Buddenbrookschen Hause, trat aus den Diensten der Familie und kehrte in ihre westpreußische Heimat zurück, um bei Verwandten den Feierabend ihres Lebens zu verbringen. Die Wahrheit zu sagen, so wurde sie von der Senatorin entlassen. Die gute Seele hatte, als die vorige Generation ihr entwachsen war, alsbald den kleinen Johann vorgefunden, den sie hegen und pflegen, dem sie Grimmsche Märchen vorlesen und die Geschichte des Onkels erzählen konnte, welcher am Schluckauf gestorben war. Nun aber war der kleine Johann eigentlich gar nicht mehr klein, er war ein fünfzehnjähriger Junge, dem sie trotz seiner Zartheit nicht mehr beträchtlich nützen konnte … und zu seiner Mutter stand sie, lange schon, in einem ziemlich unangenehmen Verhältnis. Sie hatte diese Frau, die weit später in die Familie eingetreten war als sie, eigentlich niemals recht als zugehörig und vollwertig angesehen und begann andererseits in vorgerückten Jahren mit dem Dünkel einer alten Dienerin sich selbst übertriebene Befugnisse anzumaßen. Sie erregte Anstoß, indem sie ihre Person als allzu wichtig betrachtete, indem sie sich im Haushalte dieses oder jenes Übergriffes schuldig machte … Die Lage ward unhaltbar, erregte Auftritte fanden statt, und obgleich Frau Permaneder mit der nämlichen Beredsamkeit für sie bat, mit der sie für die großen Wohnhäuser und die Möbel gebeten hatte, erhielt die alte Ida den Abschied.","Not enough of the changes!

Truth be told, she was fired by the senator. When the previous generation had outgrown her, the good soul immediately found little Johann, whom they cherish and care for, to whom she could read Grimm fairy tales and tell the story of the uncle who had died of hiccups. But now little Johann wasn't really little any more, he was a fifteen-year-old boy who, despite his tenderness, could no longer be of much use to him... and she had had a rather unpleasant relationship with his mother for a long time. She had never really considered this woman, who had joined the family much later than she, as belonging and of full value, and on the other hand, in her advanced years, with the arrogance of an old servant, she began to usurp exaggerated powers. She aroused offense by regarding her person as too important, by being guilty of this or that assault in the household...

She had raised one generation, and when they had outgrown her care, she had nursed and tended little Johann, read him Grimm’s fairy tales, and told him the story of her uncle who had died of the hiccups. But little Johann was no longer little, he was fifteen years old now, and, despite his delicate health, she could no longer be of much help to him. And for years now, her relationship with his mother had been rather strained. She had never regarded this woman, who had entered the Buddenbrook household much later than she, as a full-fledged member of the family; indeed, in her later years, she had begun to assume the airs of an old family retainer with exaggerated ideas of authority. She took herself all too seriously, which frequently led to trouble whenever she encroached on areas outside her proper role in the household. The situation was untenable, there were ugly scenes, and although Frau Permaneder interceded for her with the same eloquence with which she had pled for two family homes and their furnishings, old Ida was dismissed.","As if these were not changes enough, Mamsell Jungmann. after forty years in the service of the Buddenbrook family, left it to return to her native West Prussia to live out the evening of her life.

"Und was folgte, war alles frei und leicht geordnet, ein wunderbar müßiges und pflegsames Wohlleben, das ungestört und kummerlos verging: der Vormittag am Strande, während droben die Kurkapelle ihr Morgenprogramm erledigte, dieses Liegen und Ruhen zu Füßen des Sitzkorbes, dieses zärtliche und träumerische Spielen mit dem weichen Sande, der nicht beschmutzt, dieses mühe- und schmerzlose Schweifen und Sichverlieren der Augen über die grüne und blaue Unendlichkeit hin, von welcher, frei und ohne Hindernis, mit sanftem Sausen ein starker, frisch, wild und herrlich duftender Hauch daherkam, der die Ohren umhüllte und einen angenehmen Schwindel hervorrief, eine gedämpfte Betäubung, in der das Bewußtsein von Zeit und Raum und allem Begrenzten still selig unterging … Das Baden dann, das hier eine erfreulichere Sache war als in Herrn Asmussens Anstalt, denn es gab hier kein »Gänsefutter«, das hellgrüne, kristallklare Wasser schäumte weithin, wenn man es aufrührte, statt eines schleimigen Bretterbodens schmeichelte der weich gewellte Sandboden den Sohlen, und Konsul Hagenströms Söhne waren weit, sehr weit, in Norwegen oder Tirol. Der Konsul liebte es, im Sommer eine ausgedehntere Erholungsreise zu unternehmen – und warum also nicht, nicht wahr … Ein Spaziergang, zur Erwärmung, den Strand entlang, bis zum »Mövenstein« oder zum »Seetempel«, ein Imbiß, am Sitzkorbe eingenommen – und die Stunde näherte sich, da man hinauf in die Zimmer ging, um vor der Toilette zur Table d'hote eine kleine Stunde zu ruhen. Die Table d'hote war lustig, das Bad stand in Flor, viele Leute, Familien, die den Buddenbrooks befreundet waren, sowohl wie Hamburger und sogar englische und russische Herrschaften füllten den großen Saal des Kurhauses, an einem feierlichen Tischchen kredenzte ein schwarz gekleideter Herr die Suppe aus einer silberblanken Terrine, es gab vier Gänge, die schmackhafter, würziger und jedenfalls auf irgendeine festlichere Weise zubereitet waren als zu Hause, und an vielen Stellen der langen Tafeln ward Champagner getrunken. Oftmals kamen einzelne Herren aus der Stadt, die sich von ihren Geschäften nicht während der ganzen Woche fesseln ließen, die sich amüsieren und nach dem Essen die Roulette ein wenig in Bewegung setzen wollten: Konsul Peter Döhlmann, der seine Tochter zu Hause gelassen hatte und mit schallender Stimme auf Plattdeutsch so ungenierte Geschichten erzählte, daß die Hamburger Damen vor Lachen husteten und um einen Augenblick Pause baten; Senator Doktor Cremer, der alte Polizeichef; Onkel Christian und sein Schulfreund, Senator Gieseke, der ebenfalls ohne Familie war und alles für Christian Buddenbrook bezahlte … Später, wenn die Erwachsenen zu den Klängen der Musik unter dem Zeltdache der Konditorei den Kaffee tranken, saß Hanno auf einem Stuhle unermüdlich vor den Stufen des Tempels und lauschte … Es war gesorgt für den Nachmittag. Es gab eine Schießbude im Kurgarten, und zur Rechten der Schweizerhäuser standen die Stallgebäude mit Pferden, Eseln und den Kühen, deren Milch man warm, schaumig und duftend zur Vesperstunde trank. Man konnte einen Spaziergang machen, in das Städtchen, die »Vorderreihe« entlang; man konnte von dort aus mit einem Boote zum »Priwal« übersetzen, an dessen Strande es Bernstein zu finden gab, konnte sich auf dem Kinderspielplatze an einer Krocketpartie beteiligen oder sich auf einer Bank des bewaldeten Hügels, der hinter den Hotels gelegen war und auf dem die große Table-d'hote-Glocke hing, von Ida Jungmann vorlesen lassen … Und doch war das Klügste stets, zur See zurückzukehren und noch im Zwielicht, das Gesicht dem offenen Horizonte zugewandt, auf der Spitze des Bollwerks zu sitzen, den großen Schiffen, die vorüberglitten, mit dem Taschentuch zuzuwinken und zu horchen, wie die kleinen Wellen mit leisem Plaudern wider die Steinblöcke klatschten und die ganze Weite ringsum von diesem gelinden und großartigen Sausen erfüllt war, das dem kleinen Johann gütevoll zusprach und ihn beredete, in ungeheurer Zufriedenheit seine Augen zu schließen. Dann aber sagte Ida Jungmann: »Komm, Hannochen; müssen gehen; Abendbrotzeit; wirst dir den Tod holen, wenn du hier wirst schlafen wollen …« Welch ein beruhigtes, befriedigtes und in wohltätiger Ordnung arbeitendes Herz er immer mitnahm vom Meere! Und wenn er sein Abendbrot mit Milch oder stark gemalztem Braunbier im Zimmer gegessen hatte, während seine Mutter später in der Glasveranda des Kurhauses in größerer Gesellschaft speiste, so senkte sich, kaum daß er wieder zwischen dem altersdünnen Linnen seines Bettes lag, zu den sanften und vollen Schlägen eben dieses befriedigten Herzens und den gedämpften Rhythmen des Abendkonzertes ganz ohne Schrecken und Fieber der Schlaf über ihn …","And what followed was everything freely and easily arranged, a wonderfully idle and nurturing well-being that passed undisturbed and carefree: the morning on the beach while the spa band did their morning program upstairs, this lying and resting at the foot of the basket, this tender and dreamy one Playing with the soft sand that does not soil, this effortless and painless roaming and losing oneself of the eyes over the green and blue infinity, from which, free and without obstacle, with a gentle rushing came a strong, fresh, wild and wonderfully fragrant breath , which enveloped the ears and caused a pleasant dizziness, a muffled intoxication in which the consciousness of time and space and everything finite quietly blissfully drowned... Then the bathing, which was a more enjoyable thing here than in Mr. Asmussen's asylum, for there was here no ""goosefeed,"" the bright green, crystal-clear water foamed widely when stirred, instead of a slimy plank On the ground, the soft, wavy sandy soil flattered your feet, and Consul Hagenstrom's sons were far, very far, in Norway or the Tyrol. The Consul loved to go on a longer vacation trip in the summer - and so why not, right? A walk, to warm up, along the beach, to the ""Mövenstein"" or the ""Seetempel"", a snack taken at the seat basket - and the hour was approaching when one went upstairs to the rooms to rest for a little hour in front of the toilet for the table d'hote. The table d'hote was merry, the bathroom was in flor, many people, families who were friends of the Buddenbrooks, as well as Hamburg and even English and Russian gentlemen, filled the large hall of the Kurhaus, a gentleman dressed in black served at a ceremonial little table the soup from a shiny silver tureen, there were four courses that were tastier, spicier, and in any case prepared in some more festive way than at home, and champagne was drunk at many places at the long table. Often there were single gentlemen from the city who didn't let themselves be shackled by their business for the whole week, who wanted to have fun and play the roulette a bit after dinner: Consul Peter Döhlmann, who had left his daughter at home and went with him told such unabashed stories in a resounding voice in Low German that the Hamburg ladies coughed with laughter and asked for a moment's break; Senator Doctor Cremer, the old police chief; Uncle Christian and his school friend, Senator Gieseke, who also had no family and paid for everything for Christian Buddenbrook... Later, when the adults drank their coffee under the tent roof of the pastry shop to the sounds of music, Hanno sat tirelessly on a chair in front of the steps of the Temple and listened... The afternoon was taken care of. There was a shooting gallery in the Kurgarten, and to the right of the Swiss houses stood the stables with horses, donkeys, and the cows whose milk, warm, foamy, and fragrant, was drunk at vespers. One could go for a walk in the little town, along the ""front row""; from there one could take a boat across to the Priwal, where amber could be found on the beaches, join a game of croquet in the children's playground, or sit on a bank of the wooded hill behind the hotels and on the the great table-d'hote-bell hung, had Ida Jungmann read it aloud... And yet the wisest course was always to return to sea and, still in the twilight, to sit, facing the open horizon, on the top of the bulwark, the great ships who glided by, waving their handkerchiefs, and listening as the little waves slapped against the boulders with soft chatter, and the whole expanse around was filled with that gentle and magnificent murmur, which kindly spoke and cajoled little John, with immense contentment to close his eyes. But then Ida Jungmann said: “Come on, Hannochen; need to go; supper time; you will catch death if you want to sleep here...' What a calmed, contented and benevolently working heart he always took with him from the sea! And when he had eaten his supper with milk or heavily malted brown beer in his room, while his mother later dined with a larger group on the glass veranda of the Kurhaus, as soon as he lay again between the age-thin linen of his bed, he sank down to the soft and full beats of this satisfied heart and the subdued rhythms of the evening concert without any terror or fever the sleep over him...","And the rest of the day was so free and had no real schedule, a wonderful lazy and coddled life of ease that passed serenely and without a care. It started with mornings on the beach, while the band played its early program up above them—just lying and resting at the foot of the wicker chair, playing quiet, dreamy games with the soft sand that didn’t even get you dirty, letting your gaze drift easily and painlessly across the endless green and blue, from which came a gentle swishing sound bearing a strong, fresh, and aromatic breeze that wrapped itself around your ears and made you deliciously dizzy, a kind of muted numbness that silently, peacefully dissolved every constraint, so that you lost all sense of time and space. And then a swim, which was much more enjoyable here than at Herr Asmussen’s—there wasn’t any goose grass here , only pale green, crystal-clear water that foamed when you splashed it, and instead of slimy wooden planks there was gently rilled sand under your feet, and Consul Hagenström’s boys were far, far away, in Norway or Tyrolia. The consul loved to take his family on long trips in the summer—and there was no reason he shouldn’t, was there? A walk along the beach to warm up, out to Seagull Rock or the Temple of the Sea, and then you sat in your wicker chair and had a snack—until the time came for you to go back to the room and take a little nap before dinner. Dinner was fun, the resort blossomed with people— all the families who were friends of the Buddenbrooks, and others from Hamburg, even some from England and Russia; they filled the hotel’s great dining hall, and a man dressed in black stood at a special little table and served the soup from a shiny silver tureen. There were four courses, each tastier, spicier, or at least somehow more festive than at home, and when you looked down the long table some people were drinking champagne. Sometimes single gentlemen came from town, men who didn’t let their business keep them chained to their desks all week; they amused themselves and liked to watch the roulette wheel spin after dinner: Consul Peter Döhlmann, for instance, who always left his daughter at home and could tell such loud, outrageous stories in Plattdeutsch that the ladies from Hamburg laughed till their sides ached and begged for mercy; or Senator Cremer, the chief of police; or Uncle Christian and his old schoolchum Senator Gieseke, who also came without his family and paid all Christian Buddenbrook’s bills. Later, while the adults drank their coffee and enjoyed the music from under the pastry-shop awnings, Hanno would sit on a chair at the base of the band-shell steps and listen—and could never get enough. And there were things to do in the late afternoon, too. There was a shooting gallery on the hotel grounds, and off to the right of the Swiss-style lodges were stalls with horses, donkeys, and cows, and you could drink the warm, foamy, fragrant milk as an evening snack. You could go for a walk, into the village, along Front Row; and from there you could take a boat across to Priwall, where you could find amber on the beach; or you could join in a game of croquet on the playground or sit on a bench under the trees up on the hill just behind the hotel— that was where the large dinner bell was—and have Ida Jungmann read aloud to you. But the best idea, always, was to go back to the beach and sit out at the end of the rampart in the twilight, your face to the open horizon, and wave a handkerchief to the ships gliding by and listen to the little waves splashing against the boulders. The whole world all around was filled with that mild and marvelous swishing sound, which spoke to little Johann in a kindly voice and persuaded him to close his eyes in contentment. But then Ida Jungmann said, “Come on, Hanno, we have to go. Time for supper. You’ll catch your death if you fall asleep out here.” And when he came back from the sea, his heartbeat was so calm, untroubled, and regular. After he had eaten and drunk his milk or malted beer up in the room, and his mother had left to join the other guests for supper out on the hotel’s glassed-in veranda, he slipped between those old, thin sheets and, to the soft, strong pumping of his contented heart and the muted rhythms of the evening concert, sank into sleep, without fear or fever.","And all that followed was so easy and care-free--such a wonderfully idle and protected life. There was the forenoon on the beach, while the Kurhouss band gave its morning pro-gramme; the lying and resting at the foot of the beach-chair, the delicious, dreamy play with the soft sand that did not make you dirty, while you let your eyes rove idly and lose themselves in the green and blue infinity beyond. There was the air that swept in from that infinity--strong, free, wild, gently sighing and deliciously scented; it seemed to enfold you round, to veil your hearing and make you pleasantly giddy, and blessedly submerge all consciousness of time and space. And the bathing here was a different affair altogether from that in Herr Asmussen's establishment. There was no duck-weed here, and the light green water foamed away in crystalline clearness when you stirred it up. Instead of a slimy wooden floor there was soft sand to caress 235 BUDDENBRO DKS the foot--and Consul Hogenstrbm's sons were far away, in Norway or the Tyrol. The Consul loved to make an ex-tended journey in the holidays, and--why shouldn't he? A walk followed, to warm oneself up, along the beach to Sea-gull Rock or Ocean Temple, a little lunch by the beach-chair; then the time came to go up to one's room for an hour's rest, before making a toilette for the table-d'hote. The table-d'hote was very gay, for this was a good season at the baths, and the great dining-room was filled with acquaintances of the Buddenbrooks, Hamburg families, and even some Russians and English people. A black-clad gentleman sat at a tiny table and served the soup out of a silver tureen. There were four courses, and the food tasted nicer and more seasoned than that at home, and many people drank champagne. These were the single gentlemen who did not allow their business to keep them chained in town all the week, and who got up some little games of roulette after dinner: Consul Peter Db'hlmann, who had left his daughter at home, and told such extremely funny stories that the ladies from Hamburg laughed till their sides ached and they begged him for mercy; Senator Dr. Cremer, the old Superintendent of Police; Uncle Christian, and his friend Dr. Gieseke, who was also without his family, and paid everything for Uncle Christ-ian. After dinner, the grown-ups drank coffee under the awnings of the pastry-shop, and the band played, and Hanno sat on a chair close to the steps of the pavilion and listened unwearied. He was settled for the afternoon. There was a shootingrgallery in the Kurgarden, and at the right of the Swiss cottage were the stables, with horses and donkeys, and -the cows whose foaming, fragrant milk one drank warm every evening. One could go walking in the little town or along the front; one could go out to the Prival in a boat and look for amber on the beach, or play croquet in the children's playground, or listen to Ida Jungmann reading aloud, sitting on a bench on the wooded hillside where hung the great bell for the table-d'hote. But best of all was it to go back to the beach and sit in the twilight on the end of the breakwater, with your face turned to the open horizon. Great ships passed by, and you signalled them with your handkerchief; and you listened to the little waves slapping softly against the stones; and the whole space about you was filled with a soft and mighty sighing. It spoke so benignly to little Johann! it bade him close his eyes, it told him that all was well. But just then Ida would say, ""Come, little Hanno. It's supper-time. We must go. If you were to sit here and go to sleep, you'd die. "" How calm his heart felt, how evenly it beat, after a visit to the sea! Then he had his supper in his room--for his mother ate later, down in the glass verandah--and drank milk or malt extract, and lay down in his little bed, between the soft old linen sheets, and almost at once sleep overcame him, and he slept, to the subdued rhythm of the evening con-cert and the regular pulsations of his quiet heart."

"»Ja, seht ihr, nun ist es wieder aus«, sagte er; »nun kommt wieder die Strafe. Es rächt sich immer gleich, wenn ich mir mal einen Spaß erlaube.

Sie sind ganz einfach alle zu kurz …«","""Yes, you see, it's over now,"" he said; “Now comes the punishment again. It always takes revenge immediately when I allow myself a joke.

They're all just too short...""","“You see, as usual I have to stop,” he said. “The same old punishment. I can never have a little fun without paying for it.

"»Steht ein … bucklicht Männlein da, … fängt als an zu niesen …«, sagte Hanno und seufzte dann. Plötzlich aber veränderte sich sein Gesichtsausdruck, seine Augen schlossen sich halb, er bewegte den Kopf auf dem Kissen hin und her, und mit leiser, schmerzlicher Stimme fuhr er fort:","""There's a ... hunched over little man ... starts to sneeze ..."" said Hanno and then sighed. Suddenly, however, his expression changed, his eyes half closed, he bobbed his head on the pillow, and in a low, painful voice he continued:","“There a little hunchback stands … Sneezing, waving little hands,” Hanno said, and then he sighed. Suddenly his expression changed and he closed his eyes halfway. Tossing his head back and forth on his pillow, he went on now in a soft, plaintive voice:","11 'Little man stands--stands there-- He begins--to--sneeze--' "" He sighed. Suddenly his face changed, his eyes half closed; he moved his head back and forth on the pillow and said in a low, plaintive sing-song: """
"»Und du, Mama?« sagte sie. »Du rätst mir also auch, mein … Jawort zu geben?« Sie zögerte einen Augenblick vor dem »Jawort«, weil es ihr allzu hochtrabend und genant erschien; dann aber sprach sie es zum ersten Male in ihrem Leben mit Würde aus. Sie begann, sich ihrer anfänglichen Fassungslosigkeit ein wenig zu schämen. Es erschien ihr nicht weniger unsinnig, als zehn Minuten früher, Herrn Grünlich zu heiraten, aber die Wichtigkeit ihrer Stellung fing an, sie mit Wohlgefallen zu erfüllen.","""And you, Mama?"" she said. ""So you're also advising me to say my . . . yes?"" but then, for the first time in her life, she said it with dignity. She began to feel a little ashamed of her initial bewilderment. It seemed no less absurd to her than it had been to marry Herr Grünlich ten minutes earlier, but the importance of her position was beginning to please her.","“And you, Mama?” she asked. “Your advice, then, is that I … consent to his proposal?” She hesitated for a moment at the words “consent to his proposal”—it all sounded so stilted and forced; but she managed to speak them with dignity for the first time in her life. She began to be just a little ashamed of her initial bewilderment. It seemed no less absurd that she should marry Herr Grünlich than it had ten minutes before, but she was beginning to find considerable satisfaction in the importance of her position.","""And you, Mamma? Do you too advise me to--to--to yield 105 my consent? "" She hesitated a little before the ""yield my con-sent. "" It sounded high-flown and awkward. But then, this was the first occasion in her life that was worthy of fine language. She began to blush for her earlier lack of self-control. It seemed to her now not less unreasonable than it had ten minutes ago that she should marry Herr Gr�nliuh; but the dignity of her situation began to fill her with a sense of importance which was satisfying indeed."

"»Wir müßten längst die Million erreicht haben!« sagte er mit vor Erregung gepreßter Stimme, indes seine Hände zitterten … »Großvater hat in seiner besten Zeit schon 900000 zur Verfügung gehabt … Und welche Anstrengungen seitdem, welch hübscher Erfolg, welche guten Coups hie und da! Und Mamas Mitgift! Mamas Erbe! Ach, aber die beständige Zersplitterung … Mein Gott, sie liegt in der Natur der Dinge; verzeiht, wenn ich in diesem Augenblick allzu ausschließlich im Sinne der Firma rede und wenig familiär … Diese Mitgiften, diese Auszahlungen an Onkel Gotthold und nach Frankfurt, diese Hunderttausende, die dem Betrieb entzogen werden mußten … Und das waren damals nur zwei Geschwister des Firmenchefs … Genug, wir werden zu tun bekommen, Marcus!«","""We should have reached the million long ago!"" he said, his voice choked with excitement, while his hands trembled...

Ah, but the constant fragmentation... My God, it's the nature of things; Forgive me if at this moment I am speaking all too exclusively in the interests of the company and not very familiarly ... These dowries, these payments to Uncle Gotthold and to Frankfurt, these hundreds of thousands who had to be withdrawn from the company ... And at that time they were only two siblings of the company boss ... Enough, we'll be busy, Marcus!'","“But we ought to have made a million long before this,” he said, his voice edgy with excitement, his hands trembling. “In his best days, Grandfather had a good 900,000 at his disposal. And what efforts we have made since then—all the sweet triumphs, the fine coups now and then. Plus Mama’s dowry. And Mama’s inheritance. But it is constantly being split up.

We have our work cut out for us, Marcus.”","""We must have already passed the million,"" he said. He controlled his voice, but his hands trembled. ""Grandfather could command nine hundred thousand marks in his best time; and we've made great efforts since then, and had successes, and made fine coups here and there.

"Herr Ballerstedt schwoll an, er bewegte seine schwache Faust, arbeitete mit den Lippen und starrte dem jungen Heinricy mit emporgezogenen Augenbrauen ins Gesicht. Sein dunkelroter Kopf zitterte vor ringender Anstrengung, bis er schließlich ein »Nun …« hervorzustoßen vermochte, womit der Bann gebrochen und das Spiel gewonnen war. »Von Ihnen ist nie eine Leistung zu erlangen«, fuhr er mit Leichtigkeit und Redegewandtheit fort, »und immer haben Sie eine Entschuldigung bei der Hand, Heinricy. Wenn Sie vorige Stunde krank waren, so hätten Sie sich doch in diesen Tagen sehr wohl über das durchgenommene Pensum unterrichten können, und wenn der erste Teil vom Zustande vor dem Kreuze und der zweite vom Kreuze selbst handelt, so könnten Sie sich am Ende an den Fingern abzählen, daß der dritte Teil den Zustand nach vorbesagtem Jammer betrifft. Aber es fehlt Ihnen an der rechten Hingebung, und Sie sind nicht allein ein schwacher Mensch, Sie sind auch immer bereit, ihre Schwäche zu beschönigen und zu verteidigen.

His crimson head shook with the exertion until he finally managed to utter a ""Well..."" breaking the spell and winning the game. 'There's never anything to be gained from you,' he went on with ease and eloquence, 'and you always have an excuse ready, Heinricy. If you were ill last hour, you could very well have informed yourself about the work done during these days, and if the first part deals with the condition before the cross and the second with the cross itself, you could finally turn to the Count on your fingers that the third part concerns the condition after the aforesaid misery. But you lack the right devotion, and not only are you a weak person, you are also always ready to gloss over and defend your weakness. But remember, Heinricy, that as long as this is the case, there is no question of an elevation and improvement. You sit down.

If you were sick and missed the last class, you certainly have had time in the past few days to find out what we have already covered. And if the first part is about Job’s condition before the chastising rod and the second about the chastising rod, you surely could have counted on your fingers and concluded that the third part is about his condition after he has encountered said tribulation. But you don’t apply yourself. It is not just that you are weak-willed—you never fail to excuse your weakness and justify it.

"Manchmal, wenn er hinaus auf die grauen Giebel und die vorübergehenden Bürger blickte, wenn er seine Augen auf der vor ihm hängenden Gedenktafel, dem Jubiläumsgeschenk, den Porträts seiner Väter ruhen ließ und der Geschichte seines Hauses gedachte, so sagte er sich, daß all dies das Ende von allem sei, und daß nur dies, was jetzt vorgehe, noch gefehlt habe.

Yes, the final chapter—he was being held up to ridicule, and, to crown it all, his name and his family’s private life were the subject of gossip and scorn.

"Man versicherte den kleinen Johann, daß dieser Mann ihm viel Gutes tue und ihn vor vielen noch größeren Schmerzen bewahre; aber wenn Hanno die Pein, die Herr Brecht ihm zugefügt, mit dem positiven und fühlbaren Vorteil verglich, den er ihm verdankte, so überwog die erstere zu sehr, als daß er nicht alle diese Besuche in der Mühlenstraße zu den schlimmsten aller unnützen Qualen hätte rechnen müssen. Im Hinblick auf die Weisheitszähne, die dermaleinst kommen würden, mußten vier Backzähne, die soeben, weiß, schön und noch vollkommen gesund herangewachsen waren, entfernt werden, und das nahm, da man das Kind nicht überanstrengen wollte, vier Wochen in Anspruch. Was für eine Zeit! Diese langgezogene Marter, in der schon die Angst vor dem Bevorstehenden wieder einsetzte, wenn noch die Erschöpfung nach dem Überstandenen herrschte, ging zu weit. Als der letzte Zahn gezogen war, lag Hanno acht Tage lang krank, und zwar aus reiner Ermattung.","Little Johann was assured that this man would do him a great deal of good and save him from much greater pain; but when Hanno compared the pain that Herr Brecht inflicted on him with the positive and tangible benefit he owed him, the former outweighed so much that he did not count all these visits to Mühlenstrasse among the worst of all useless torments have to. In view of the wisdom teeth that would come one day, four molars that had just grown, white, beautiful and still perfectly healthy, had to be removed, and this took four weeks, as one did not want to overtax the child. What a time! This long-drawn-out torture, in which the fear of what was to come set in again while exhaustion after having survived, went too far. When the last tooth was pulled, Hanno lay ill for eight days out of sheer exhaustion.","They assured little Johann that what this man did to him was for his own good and that it would prevent much greater pain later on. But when Hanno compared the pain that Herr Brecht caused him with any noticeable positive results, the former outweighed the latter to such an extent that he could only regard these visits to Mühlen Strasse as the most useless and terrible torture imaginable. To make room for the wisdom teeth that would come later, four molars—four new, beautiful, white, and perfectly healthy molars—had to be removed, a procedure that was stretched out over several weeks in order not to overtax the child. And what weeks they were! It was a protracted martyrdom, during which the dread of the next visit set in before he had even overcome the strain of the last—and it proved too much. After the final tooth was pulled, Hanno lay ill in bed for a week—out of pure exhaustion.","They assured little Johann that this man would do him good and save him suffering in the end. But when Hanno weighed his present pains against the positive good that had accrued from them, he felt that the former far outweighed the latter; and he regarded these visits to Mill Street as so much unnecessary torture. They removed four beautiful white molars which had just come in, to make room for the wisdom teeth expected later: this required four weeks of visits, in order not to subject the boy to too great a strain. It was a fearful time!--a long drawn-out martyrdom, in which dread of the next visit began before the last one, with its attendant exhaustion, was fairly over. When the last tooth was drawn, Hanno was quite worn out, and was ill in bed for a week."

"Nun aber kommt etwas, liebe Mama, das Wichtigste, welches ich mir bis zum Schlusse aufgehoben. Vor einiger Zeit nämlich fühlte ich mich ein bißchen sonderbar, weißt Du, nicht ganz gesund und doch wieder noch anders; bei Gelegenheit sagte ich es dem Doktor Klaaßen. Das ist ein ganz kleiner Mensch mit einem großen Kopf und einem noch größeren geschweiften Hut darauf. Immer drückt er sein spanisches Rohr, das als Griff eine runde Knochenplatte hat, an seinen langen Kinnbart, der beinahe hellgrün ist, weil er ihn lange Jahre schwarz gefärbt hat. Nun, Du hättest ihn sehen sollen! Er antwortete gar nicht, rückte an seiner Brille, zwinkerte mit seinen roten Äuglein, nickte mir mit seiner Kartoffelnase zu, kicherte und musterte mich so impertinent, daß ich nicht wußte, wo ich bleiben sollte. Dann untersuchte er mich und sagte, alles lasse sich aufs prächtigste an, nur müsse ich Mineralwasser trinken, denn ich sei vielleicht ein bißchen bleichsüchtig. – O Mama, vertraue es dem guten Papa ganz vorsichtig an, damit er es in die Familienpapiere schreibt. Sobald als möglich hörst Du Weiteres!","But now something is coming, dear Mama, the most important thing, which I have saved for last. Because some time ago I felt a little strange, you know, not quite healthy and yet still different; on occasion I told Doctor Klaassen. This is a very small human with a large head and an even larger bonnet. He always presses his Spanish reed, which has a round bone plate as a handle, against his long goatee, which is almost light green because he dyed it black for many years. Well, you should have seen him! He didn't answer at all, adjusted his glasses, blinked his red eyes, nodded at me with his potato nose, giggled and eyed me so impertinently that I didn't know where to stay. Then he examined me and said everything was going splendidly, only I had to drink mineral water because I was maybe a bit anaemic. – O Mama, entrust it to good papa very carefully so that he writes it down in the family papers. You will hear more as soon as possible!","And now, Mama, comes the most important thing, which I’ve saved till last. For some time now I’ve been feeling a bit strange, you know, not exactly ill and yet not really well. And so I happened to mention this to Dr. Klaassen. He’s a tiny little man with a big head, with an even bigger floppy hat. He carries a cane walking stick with a round bone handle, and he always presses it up against his long beard, which is almost green, he’s been dying it black so long. Well, you should have seen him! He didn’t say a thing, just set his spectacles to rights, winked one little red eye, nodded his potato of a nose at me, giggled, and looked me up and down so impertinently that I didn’t know what to do. Then he examined me and said that everything was going splendidly, but that I should drink mineral water, because I might be just a bit anemic. Oh, Mama, do tell Papa, but very circumspectly, so that he can enter it in the family history. I’ll write more about it as soon as possible.","And now, dear Mamma, comes the most important part of my letter, which I have kept till the last. A while ago I was feeling rather queer--not exactly ill and yet not quite well. I told Dr. Klaasen about it when I had the chance. He is a little bit of a man with a big head and a still bigger hat. He carries a cane with a flat round handle made of a piece of bone, and walks with it pressed against his whiskers, which are almost light-green from being dyed so many years. Well, you should have seen him! he did not answer my questions at all, but jerked his eye-glasses, twinkled his little eyes, wrinkled his nose at me --it looks like a potato--snickered, giggled, and stared so impertinently that I did not know what to do. Then he examined me, and said everything was going on well, only I must drink mineral water, because I am perhaps a little anaemic. Dh, Mamma, do tell Papa about it, so he can put it in the family book. I will write you again as soon as possible, you may be sure."
"Herr Modersohn blinzelte abermals, er blickte um sich, verzog säuerlich den Mund und sah dann wieder ins Klassenbuch, indem er mit seiner kleinen, ungeschickten Hand auf den Namen zeigte, den er nun aufrufen wollte.","Herr Modersohn blinked again, looked around, twisted his mouth sourly, and then looked back at the class register, pointing with his small, clumsy hand to the name he was about to call out.","Herr Modersohn blinked again, looked around, pulled a peevish face, and gazed back at his attendance book, running his little, clumsy hand down to the name he now decided to call.","Herr Modersohn blinked afresh.

"Er fing an, ihn ein wenig in das Bereich seiner zukünftigen Tätigkeit einzuführen, er nahm ihn mit sich auf Geschäftsgänge, zum Hafen hinunter und ließ ihn dabeistehen, wenn er am Kai mit den Löscharbeitern in einem Gemisch von Dänisch und Plattdeutsch plauderte, in den kleinen, finsteren Speicherkontoren mit den Geschäftsführern konferierte oder draußen den Männern einen Befehl erteilte, die mit hohlen und langgezogenen Rufen die Kornsäcke zu den Böden hinaufwanden … Für Thomas Buddenbrook selbst war dieses Stück Welt am Hafen, zwischen Schiffen, Schuppen und Speichern, wo es nach Butter, Fischen, Wasser, Teer und geöltem Eisen roch, von klein auf der liebste und interessanteste Aufenthalt gewesen; und da Freude und Teilnahme daran sich bei seinem Sohne von selbst nicht äußerten, so mußte er darauf bedacht sein, sie zu wecken … Wie hießen nun die Dampfer, die mit Kopenhagen verkehrten?

For Thomas Buddenbrook himself, this piece of the world here on the harbor—among the ships, sheds, and warehouses, where things smelled of butter, fish, water, tar, and well-oiled iron—had been a favorite spot since he was a boy, the most interesting place he knew; and since Hanno did not express joy and approval on his own, the senator felt compelled to awaken those feelings in his son.

But, on the other hand, if you don't go back, if you give this nonsense so much importance as to make a scandal out of it, then you will be wounding our dignity indeed."""

"Und als es mit den Produktionen der Schüler zu Ende war, hatte die Stunde auch jedes Interesse verloren. Doktor Mantelsack ließ einen Hochbegabten auf eigene Faust weiter übersetzen und hörte ebensowenig zu wie die anderen vierundzwanzig, die anfingen, sich für die nächste Stunde zu präparieren. Dies war nun gleichgültig. Man konnte niemandem ein Zeugnis dafür geben, noch überhaupt den dienstlichen Eifer darnach beurteilen … Auch war die Stunde nun gleich zu Ende. Sie war zu Ende; es schellte. So hatte es kommen sollen für Hanno. Sogar ein Kopfnicken hatte er bekommen.","And when the students' productions were over, the lesson had lost all interest. Dr. Mantelsack had a highly gifted person continue to translate on his own and listened just as little as the other twenty-four, who began to prepare themselves for the next lesson.

That's how it was supposed to be for Hanno. He even got a nod.","And once the students had been tested, they lost all interest in the class themselves. Dr. Mantelsack had one of his gifted pupils volunteer to continue the translation, but he paid no more attention to him than did the other twenty-four boys, who began to do the homework for their next class. It made no difference now. No more grades would be awarded here today, and there was no way of judging their conscientiousness in Latin now. And the class was almost over anyway. It was over; the bell rang. So this was how things had been destined to turn out for Hanno.

It just smelled a little like rotten seaweed…”","“Do you want to know just how stupid I used to be?” Tony asked. “I wanted some of those pretty, colored stars that jellyfish have inside.

"Auch gestaltete sich die Unterhaltung im Landschaftszimmer immer weniger anziehend. Mit unentrinnbarer Notwendigkeit war allmählich die eine, unheimliche Angelegenheit Gegenstand des Gespräches geworden, über die man bislang dem festlichen Abend zu Ehren geschwiegen, die aber fast keinen Augenblick aufgehört hatte, alle Gemüter zu beschäftigen: Direktor Weinschenks Prozeß. Hugo Weinschenk selbst hielt Vortrag darüber, mit einer gewissen wilden Munterkeit in Miene und Bewegungen. Er berichtete über Einzelheiten der nun durch das Fest unterbrochenen Zeugenvernehmung, tadelte lebhaft die allzu bemerkbare Voreingenommenheit des Präsidenten Doktor Philander und kritisierte mit souveränem Spott den höhnischen Ton, den der Staatsanwalt Doktor Hagenström gegen ihn und die Entlastungszeugen anzuwenden für passend erachte. Übrigens habe Breslauer verschiedene belastende Aussagen sehr witzig entkräftet und ihn aufs bestimmteste versichert, daß an eine Verurteilung vorläufig gar nicht zu denken sei. – Der Senator warf hie und da aus Höflichkeit eine Frage ein, und Frau Permaneder, die mit emporgezogenen Schultern auf dem Sofa saß, murmelte manchmal einen furchtbaren Fluch gegen Moritz Hagenström. Die übrigen aber schwiegen. Sie schwiegen so tief, daß auch der Direktor allmählich verstummte; und während drüben im Saale dem kleinen Hanno die Zeit schnell wie im Himmelreiche verging, lagerte im Landschaftszimmer eine schwere, beklommene, ängstliche Stille, die noch fortherrschte, als um halb 9 Uhr Christian aus dem Klub, von der Weihnachtsfeier der Junggesellen und Suitiers zurückkehrte.","The conversation in the landscape room also became less and less attractive. Out of inescapable necessity, the subject of conversation had gradually become the one uncanny matter about which, in honor of the festive evening, they had hitherto been kept silent, but which had occupied everyone's minds for almost no moment: Director Weinschenk's trial. Hugo Weinschenk himself lectured about it, with a certain wild cheerfulness in his face and movements. He reported on the details of the hearing of witnesses, which was now interrupted by the party, vigorously criticized the all too noticeable bias of the President, Doctor Philander, and, with sovereign mockery, criticized the sneering tone that the prosecutor, Doctor Hagenstrom, considered appropriate to use against him and the defense witnesses. Incidentally, Breslauer had very wittily refuted various incriminating statements and assured him in the most definite manner that a conviction was out of the question for the time being. Now and then the senator would throw in a question out of politeness, and Frau Permaneder, sitting on the sofa with her shoulders hunched, sometimes murmured a terrible curse against Moritz Hagenstrom. But the rest were silent. They were so silent that the director gradually fell silent too; and while over there in the hall time passed quickly for little Hanno, as if in heaven, there was a heavy, uneasy, anxious silence in the landscape room, which still prevailed when, at half past eight, Christian returned from the club, from the Christmas party for the bachelors and suitiers.","Besides, the conversation in the landscape room was becoming less and less interesting. Gradually, ineluctably, it had turned to the one dreadful theme that had been on everyone’s mind all evening, but about which they had all been silent until now, out of respect for the festivities—Herr Weinschenk’s trial. Hugo Weinschenk gave a little survey of the matter, with a kind of wild cheerfulness in his expression and gestures. The trial was now in recess because of the holidays, but he reported in detail the testimony of various witnesses, was very lively in his censure of Dr. Philander, the presiding judge, whose biases were only too obvious, and with masterful scorn he criticized the mocking tone that the prosecutor, Dr. Hagenström, had thought appropriate when addressing him or witnesses in his defense. But Breslauer had very wittily weakened various pieces of incriminating evidence and had assured him in no uncertain terms that there was no reason at present even to think of a conviction. Now and then the senator would ask a polite question, and Frau Permaneder, who was sitting on the sofa with her shoulders raised high, would mutter occasionally, calling dreadful curses down on Moritz Hagenström. The others, however, said not a word. Their silence was so profound that Hugo Weinschenk gradually fell silent himself; and whereas in the next room time sped past for Hanno on angels’ wings, a heavy, oppressive, anxious silence lay over the landscape room—and continued until Christian returned at half past eight from the Club’s Christmas party for bachelors and suitiers.","The con\ersation in the landscape-room was growing IPS. * and less agreeable. Inevitably, irresistiblv, it had nrri\ed �U the one dismal theme which hail been in everybody's niiml, but which they had thus far avoided, as a tribute to the f(Mal e\ening. Hugo Weinschcnk himself dilated upon it, with a wild levity of manner and gesture. He explained certain de-tails of the procedure--the examination of witnesses had now been interrupted by the Christmas recess--condemned the very obvious bias of the President, Dr. Philander, and poured scorn on the attitude which the Public Prosecutor, Dr. Hagenstriim, thought it proper to assume toward himself and the witnesses for the defence. Breslauer had succeeded in drawing the sting of several of his most slanderous remarks; and he had assured the Director that, for the present, there need be no fear of a conviction. The Senator threw in a question now and then, out of courtesy; and Frau Permaneder, sitting on the sofa with elevated shoulders, would utter fearful imprecations against Dr. Moritz Ha�enstrbm. But the others were silent: so profoundly silent that the Director at length fell silent too. For little Hanno, over in the dining-room, the time sped by on angels' wings; but in the landscape-room there reigned an oppressive silence, which dragged on till Christian came back from the club, where he had celebrated Christmas with the bachelors and good fellows."

"Es war Sonntag gewesen, und nachdem er sich mehrere Tage hintereinander von Herrn Brecht hatte malträtieren lassen müssen, hatte er zur Belohnung seine Mutter ins Stadttheater begleiten dürfen, um den »Lohengrin« zu hören. Die Freude auf diesen Abend hatte seit einer Woche schon sein Leben ausgemacht. Beklagenswert war nur, daß stets vor solcherlei Festen soviel des Widerwärtigen lagerte und bis zum letzten Augenblick die freie und freudige Aussicht darauf verdarb. Aber endlich war doch am Sonnabend die Schulzeit überstanden gewesen, und die Tretmaschine hatte zum letzten Male in seinem Munde mit schmerzhaftem Summen gebohrt … Nun war alles beiseite geschafft und überwunden gewesen, denn die Schulaufgaben hatte er kurz entschlossen jenseits des Sonntagabends geschoben. Was hatte der Montag bedeutet? War es wahrscheinlich gewesen, daß er jemals anbrechen würde? Man glaubt an keinen Montag, wenn man am Sonntag abend den »Lohengrin« hören soll … Er hatte am Montag frühzeitig aufstehen wollen und diese albernen Sachen erledigen – damit genug! Nun war er frei umhergegangen, hatte die Freude seines Herzens gepflegt, am Flügel geträumt und alle Widrigkeiten vergessen.","It was Sunday, and after he had had to let Herr Brecht maltreat him for several days in a row, he was allowed to accompany his mother to the Stadttheater to hear Lohengrin as a reward. The joy of this evening had been his life for a week. It was only deplorable that always before such festivals there was so much repugnance that spoiled the free and joyful prospect of it up to the last moment. But finally, on Saturday, school was over, and the pedal machine had pierced his mouth with a painful hum for the last time... Now everything had been put aside and overcome, because he had spontaneously postponed his homework beyond Sunday evening. What did Monday mean? Was it likely that it would ever break? You don't believe in a Monday when you're supposed to be listening to ""Lohengrin"" on Sunday evening... He wanted to get up early on Monday and do all these silly things - that's enough! Now he had roamed free, nurturing the joy of his heart, dreaming at the piano and forgetting all adversity.","It had been a Sunday, and after several days of abuse at the hands of Herr Brecht he had been allowed to accompany his mother to the municipal theater for a performance of Lohengrin. For over a week his life had been filled with joyful anticipation of the event. The sad part was that, as always just before a festive occasion, so many disagreeable things stood in the way and spoiled the simple enjoyment of anticipation until the very last moment. But at last Saturday had come, another week of school was behind him, and the treadle machine had hummed its painful hum and drilled in his mouth for the last time. He had survived, and everything else could be shoved aside, including his homework, which he had quickly decided to put off until after Sunday evening. What had Monday meant then? Was it even probable that it would ever come? You can’t believe in Monday when you’re going to hear Lohengrin on Sunday evening. His plan was to get up early Monday morning and do his stupid homework then—and that was that. And he had walked about a free man, cherishing the joy in his heart, dreaming at his piano, forgetting all disagreeable things.","It was Sunday evening; and after having been maltreated by Herr Brerht for several days on end, he had been taken as a reward to a performance of Lohengrin.

Only, it was a pity that on such occasions the full pleasure of the anticipation had to be marred by disagreeable commonplaces that went on up to the very last minute. But at length Saturday came, school was over for the week, and Herr Brecht's little drill had bored and buzzed away in the mouth for the last time. Now everything was out of the way and done with--for he had ob-stinately put off his preparation for Monday until after the opera. What was Monday to him? Was it likely it would ever dawn? Who believes in Monday, when he is to hear Lohengrin on Sunday evening? He would get up early on Monday and get the wretched stuff done--and that was all there was to it.

"Sie weinte bitterlich, als die Stunde herankam, da sie dem kleinen Johann Lebewohl zu sagen hatte. Er umarmte sie, legte dann die Hände auf den Rücken, stützte sich auf sein eines Bein, indem er den anderen Fuß auf die Zehenspitzen stellte, und sah zu, wie sie davonging, mit demselben grüblerischen und nach innen gekehrten Blick, den seine goldbraunen, bläulich umschatteten Augen an der Leiche seiner Großmutter, beim Tode seines Vaters, bei der Auflösung der großen Haushalte und so manchem weniger äußerlichen Erlebnis ähnlicher Art angenommen hatten … Der alten Ida Verabschiedung schloß sich in seiner Anschauung folgerichtig den anderen Vorgängen des Abbröckelns, des Endens, des Abschließens, der Zersetzung an, denen er beigewohnt hatte. Dergleichen befremdete ihn nicht mehr; es hatte ihn seltsamerweise niemals befremdet. Manchmal, wenn er seinen Kopf mit dem gelockten hellbraunen Haar und den immer ein wenig verzerrten Lippen erhob und die feinen Flügel seiner Nase sich empfindlich öffneten, war es, als schnuppere er behutsam in die Atmosphäre und Lebensluft, die ihn umgab, gewärtig, den Duft, den seltsam vertrauten Duft zu verspüren, den an der Bahre seiner Großmutter alle Blumengerüche nicht zu übertäuben vermocht hatten …","She wept bitterly when the hour came when she had to bid little Johann farewell. He hugged her, then put his hands behind his back, propped himself up on one leg with the other foot on tiptoe, and watched her walk away with the same brooding and introverted gaze that his tawny, bluish shaded eyes at the corpse of his grandmother, at the death of his father, at the breaking up of large households and many a less external experience of a similar kind ... In his view, old Ida's farewell was logically connected to the other processes of crumbling, of ending, of closing, of decomposition, which he had witnessed. Such things no longer alienated him; oddly enough, it had never alienated him. Sometimes, when he lifted his head with the curly light brown hair and the lips that were always a little distorted, and the fine wings of his nose opened sensitively, it was as if he were carefully sniffing the atmosphere and life air that surrounded him, aware of the scent , to feel the strangely familiar scent that all the scents of flowers on his grandmother's bier had not been able to drown out...","She wept bitterly when the time came to say farewell to her little Johann. He embraced her: then, putting his hands behind his back and shifting his weight to one leg while balancing his other foot on the toe, he watched her depart; and his golden-brown eyes rimmed with bluish shadows had the same brooding, introspective look that they had taken on when he stood beside his grandmother’s corpse, when his father died, when their grand old home was broken up—or on so many other occasions, which had less to do with life’s external events. As he saw it, old Ida’s departure was consistent with the other instances of decline, dissolution, and termination that he had witnessed. That sort of thing no longer astounded him—had never astounded him, strangely enough. Sometimes, when he would raise his head with its curly brown hair and flair his nostrils fastidiously, his lips slightly twisted as always, it looked as if he were cautiously sniffing the air and the atmosphere of life around him, expecting to catch a whiff of that odor, that strangely familiar odor, which the fragrance of all those flowers beside his grandmother’s casket had not been able to overpower.","She wept bitterly when the hour came to bid little Johann farewell. He put his arms about her and embraced her. Then, with his hands behind his bark, resting his weight on one leg while the other poised on the tips of the toes, he watched her out of sight; his face wore the same brooding, introspective look with which he had stood at his father's death-bed, and his grandmother's bier, witnessed the breaking-up of the great household, and shared in so many events of the same kind, though of lesser outward significance. The departure of old Ida belonged to the same category as other events with which he was already familiar: breakings-up, closings, endings, disintegrations--he had seen them all. Such events did not disturb him--they had never disturbed him. But he would lift his head, with the curling light-brown hair, inflate one delicate nostril, and it was as if he cau-tiously sniffed the air about him, expecting to perceive that odour, that strange and yet familiar odour which, at his grand-mother's bier, not all the scent of the flowers had been able to disguise."

Denn auf der weißgedeckten Tafel, die sich lang und breit, mit den Geschenken beladen, von den Fenstern fast bis zur Türe zog, setzte sich eine Reihe kleinerer, mit Konfekt behängter Bäume fort, die ebenfalls von brennenden Wachslichtchen erstrahlten. Und es brannten die Gasarme, die aus den Wänden hervorkamen, und es brannten die dicken Kerzen auf den vergoldeten Kandelabern in allen vier Winkeln. Große Gegenstände, Geschenke, die auf der Tafel nicht Platz hatten, standen nebeneinander auf dem Fußboden. Kleinere Tische, ebenfalls weiß gedeckt, mit Gaben belegt und mit brennenden Bäumchen geschmückt, befanden sich zu den Seiten der beiden Türen: Das waren die Bescherungen der Dienstboten und der Hausarmen.","The whole hall, filled with the scent of singed fir branches, shone and glittered with innumerable small flames, and the sky-blue wallpaper with its white statues of gods made the large room appear even brighter. The flames of the candles that covered the huge fir tree between the dark red curtained windows, which, adorned with silver tinsel and large white lilies, a shimmering angel at its top and a plastic nativity scene at its feet, towered almost to the ceiling, flickered in the general flood of light like distant stars. For on the white-covered table, which stretched long and wide, laden with gifts, from the windows almost to the door, a row of smaller trees hung with sweets continued, which also shone with burning wax lights. And the arms of gas that came out of the walls were burning, and the big candles were burning on the gilded candelabra in all four corners. Large objects, gifts that didn't fit on the table, stood side by side on the floor. Smaller tables, also covered in white, with gifts and decorated with burning trees, were located on the sides of the two doors: these were the gifts of the servants and the household poor.","The whole room was fragrant with lightly singed evergreen boughs and glowed and sparkled with the light of countless little flames; the sky-blue wallpaper with its white statues of gods made the large room look even brighter. Set between the dark red of the curtained windows stood the mighty Christmas tree, towering almost to the ceiling—a shining angel at the top, a sculptured manger scene at the base; it was decorated with silvery tinsel and white lilies and flooded by the soft light of the candle flames that flickered like distant stars. A row of smaller trees trimmed with candy and more burning wax candles had been arranged on the table, which extended from the window almost to the door, its whole length covered with a white linen cloth and laden with gifts. The gas jets along the walls were lit, and thick candles were burning on four candelabra, one set in each corner of the room. The larger presents that did not fit on the table had been placed in a long row on the floor. At either side of the door were smaller tables, likewise covered with white linen, each ornamented by a little tree with candles aflame and laden with presents—the gifts for the servants and the “poor.”","The whnle great room was filled with the fragrance of slightly singed evergreen twigs and glowing with light from countless tiny flames. The sky-blue hangings with the white figures on them added to the brilliance. There stood the mighty tree, between the dark red window-curtains, towering nearly to the ceiling, decorated with silver tinsel and large white lilies, with a shining angel at the top and the manger at the foot. Its candles twinkled in the general flood of light like far-off stars. And a row of tiny trees, also full of stars and hung with comfits, stood on the long white table, laden with presents, that stretched from the window to the door.

Large objects, too large to stand upon the table, were arranged upon the floor, and two smaller tables, likewise adorned with tiny trees and covered with gifts for the servants and the poor, stood on either side of the door."
"»Nein!« sagte der Senator plötzlich mit lauter Stimme, erhob mit einem Ruck den Kopf, ließ den Fenstergriff fahren, stieß sich förmlich davon zurück und sagte ebenso laut: »Dies ist zu Ende!« Dann räusperte er sich, um über die unangenehme Empfindung hinwegzukommen, die seine eigene, einsame Stimme ihm verursachte, wandte sich und begann, schnell gesenkten Kopfes, die Hände auf dem Rücken, hin und her durch alle Zimmer zu gehen.","""No!"" said the senator suddenly in a loud voice, jerked his head up, dropped the window handle, practically pushed away and said just as loudly: ""This is over!""

"Wie ungeschickt! dachte sie.

"Die Ehe, aus welcher der kleine Johann hervorgegangen war, hatte, als Gesprächsgegenstand genommen, in der Stadt niemals an Reiz verloren. So gewiß wie jedem der beiden Gatten etwas Extravagantes und Rätselhaftes eigen war, so gewiß trug diese Ehe selbst den Charakter des Ungewöhnlichen und Fragwürdigen. Hier ein wenig hinters Licht zu kommen und, abgesehen von den dürftigen, äußeren Tatsachen, dem Verhältnis ein wenig auf den Grund zu gehen, schien eine schwierige, aber lohnende Aufgabe … Und in Wohn- und Schlafstuben, in Klubs und Kasinos, ja selbst an der Börse sprachen die Leute über Gerda und Thomas Buddenbrook desto mehr, je weniger sie von ihnen wußten.","The marriage from which little Johann was born had never lost its charm in the city, taken as a topic of conversation. As surely as there was something extravagant and enigmatic about each of the two husbands, so surely this marriage itself bore the character of the unusual and questionable.

And in parlors and bedrooms, in clubs and casinos, even on on the stock exchange people talked more about Gerda and Thomas Buddenbrook the less they knew about them.","THE MARRIAGE of which little Johann was the issue had never lost its appeal as a topic of conversation among the town’s citizens. Just as both spouses had something extravagant and enigmatic about them, so, too, the marriage itself was considered unusual and problematical. And so the difficult task of getting behind mere appearances and of probing the bedrock of the relationship that lay beneath the few external facts, might very well have its rewards. And, the less people knew about Gerda and Thomas Buddenbrook, the more they spoke about them in parlors, bedrooms, clubs, and casinos—even on the exchange.","THE marriage of which little Johann had been the issue had never lost charm in the town as a subject for conversation. Since both of the parties to it were still felt to have some-thing queer about them, the union itself must partake of thai character of the strange and uncanny which they each pos-sessed. To get behind it even a little, to look beneath the scanty outward facts to the bottom of this relation, seemed a difficult, but certainly a stimulating task. And in bedrooms and sitting-rooms, in clubs and casinos, yes, even on 'Change itself, people still talked about Gerda and Thomas Buddenbrook."

"Mit Christian stand es ähnlich wie mit der armen Klothilde. Er hatte noch nicht eine Träne vergossen und schämte sich dessen ein wenig. Das Gefühl der Blamiertheit überwog in ihm jegliche andere Empfindung. Auch hatte die beständige Beschäftigung mit den eigenen Zuständen und Sonderbarkeiten ihn abgenutzt und stumpf gemacht. Hie und da richtete er sich auf, strich mit der Hand über seine kahle Stirn und sagte mit gepreßter Stimme: »Ja, es ist furchtbar traurig!« Er sagte dies zu sich selbst, hielt es sich gewaltsam vor und nötigte seine Augen, ein wenig feucht zu werden …","It was the same with Christian as it was with poor Klothilde. He hadn't shed a tear yet and was a little ashamed of it. The feeling of shame outweighed any other feeling in him. Also, constant preoccupation with his own circumstances and oddities had worn him out and dulled him. Now and then he sat up, stroked his bald forehead with his hand and said in a strained voice: ""Yes, it's terribly sad!"" He said this to himself, held it forcibly in front of him and forced his eyes, a little getting wet...","Christian was in much the same state as poor Klothilde. He had not shed a single tear and was a little ashamed of the fact. His sense of shame outweighed everything else he felt. His constant preoccupation with his own condition, with his physical and mental quirks, had left him exhausted and lethargic. Now and then he would sit up straight and rub his hand across his bald head and say in a choked voice, “Yes, it’s terribly sad.” He said this to himself, as a kind of stern reprimand, and forced his eyes to moisten a little.","With Christian it was as with poor Clothilde. He had not shed a tear--which fact rather mortified him. It was true, too, that his constant preoccupation with his own condition had 'used him up emotionally and made him insensitive.

He said it to him-self, with strong self-reproach, and did his best to make his eyes water."
"Die weite, hallende Diele drunten war mit großen, viereckigen Steinfliesen gepflastert. Bei der Windfangtüre sowohl wie am anderen Ende lagen Kontorräumlichkeiten, während die Küche, aus der noch immer der säuerliche Geruch der Chalottensauce hervordrang, mit dem Weg zu den Kellern links von der Treppe lag. Ihr gegenüber, in beträchtlicher Höhe, sprangen seltsame, plumpe aber reinlich lackierte Holzgelasse aus der Wand hervor: die Mädchenkammern, die nur durch eine Art freiliegender, gerader Stiege von der Diele aus zu erreichen waren. Ein Paar ungeheurer alter Schränke und eine geschnitzte Truhe standen daneben.","The wide, echoing hallway below was paved with large square flagstones. At the porch door as well as at the other end were offices, while the kitchen, from which the sour smell of chalote sauce still emanated, lay to the left of the stairs with the path to the cellars. Opposite her, at a considerable height, jutted out of the wall strange, clumsy but neatly varnished wooden chambers: the girls' chambers, which could only be reached by a kind of exposed, straight staircase from the hallway. A pair of immense old cupboards and a carved chest stood nearby.","The wide, echoing passageway below was paved with large, square stones. There were offices both to one side of the vestibule door and at the far end of the passage, whereas the doors to the cellar and the kitchen, still fragrant with tart shallot sauce, were to the left of the stairway. On the far side, somewhat higher up, newly painted wooden galleries jutted from the wall: the servants’ quarters, the only access a flight of open stairs rising from the passageway. Next to the stairs stood a couple of enormous old cupboards and a carved chest.","The broad echoing passage-way below was paved with great square flagstones. At either end of it were several offices. The odour of the onion sauce still floated out from the kitchen, which, with the entrance to the cellars, lay on the, left of the steps. On the right, at the height of a storey above the passageway, a scaffolding of ungainly but neatly varnished rafters thrust out from the wall, supporting the servants' quar-ters above. A sort of ladder which led up to them from the passage was their only means of ingress or egress. Below the scaffolding were some enormous old cupboards and a carved chest."
"Sie gingen dann durch den kahlen, in halbgeschmolzenem Schnee liegenden Garten, taten einen Blick in das »Portal« und kehrten auf den vorderen Hof zurück, dorthin, wo die Waschküche lag, um sich von hier aus den schmalen gepflasterten Gang zwischen den Mauern entlang über den hinteren Hof, wo der Eichbaum stand, nach dem Rückgebäude zu begeben. Hier gab es nichts als vernachlässigte Altersschwäche. Zwischen den Pflastersteinen des Hofes wucherte Gras und Moos, die Treppen des Hauses waren in vollem Verfall, und die freie Katzenfamilie im Billardsaale konnte man nur flüchtig beunruhigen, indem man die Tür öffnete, ohne einzutreten, denn der Fußboden war hier nicht sicher.","They then went through the bare garden lying in half-melted snow, peered into the ""portal,"" and returned to the front courtyard, to where the scullery was, and from there along the narrow cobbled passage between the walls to go through the back courtyard, where the oak tree stood, to the back building. There was nothing here but neglected old age. Grass and moss grew rampant between the cobblestones of the yard, the stairs of the house were in complete decay, and the free cat family in the billiard room could only be alarmed fleetingly by opening the door without stepping in, for the floor here was not safe.","They walked through the bare garden, which lay under a blanket of melting snow, took a quick look at the “Portal,” then turned back to the front courtyard; taking the narrow, flagstone path to the left of the scullery; passing between walls on either side, they entered the back courtyard, where the oak tree stood, and approached the back building. But there was nothing to see there but the dilapidation of long neglect. Grass and moss grew in the cracks between the cobblestones of the courtyard; the stairs were in total disrepair, and they barely disturbed the family of feral cats in the billiard hall—given the unsafe floor, they could only open the door and peer in.","They went through the garden, lying bare and wretched under half-melting snow, looked at the Portal, and returned to the laundry, in the front courtyard; and thence by the narrow paved walk that led between walls to the back court-yard with the oak-tree, and the ""back building. "" Here there was nothing but old age, neglect, and dilapidation. Grass and moss grew between the paving-stones, the steps were in a state of advanced decay, and they could only look into the billiard-room without entering,--the floor was so bad--so the family of cats that lived there rent-free was not disturbed."
"In der Tat, dort oben auf der dritten Etage der waldigen Terrasse saßen die hauptsächlichsten Mitglieder dieser beiden vorteilhaft liierten Familien an zwei zusammengerückten Tischen und speisten unter angeregten Gesprächen. Der alte Senator Möllendorpf präsidierte, ein blasser Herr mit weißen, dünnen, spitzen Kotelettes; er war zuckerkrank. Seine Gattin, geborene Langhals, hantierte mit ihrer langgestielten Lorgnette, und nach wie vor umstand das graue Haar unordentlich ihren Kopf. Ihr Sohn war da, August, ein blonder junger Mann von wohlsituiertem Äußeren und Gatte Julchens, der geborenen Hagenström, welche, klein, lebhaft, mit großen, blanken, schwarzen Augen und beinahe ebenso großen Brillanten an den Ohrläppchen, zwischen ihren Brüdern Hermann und Moritz saß. Konsul Hermann Hagenström begann sehr stark zu werden, denn er lebte vortrefflich und man sagte sich, daß er gleich morgens mit Gänseleberpastete beginne. Er trug einen rötlich blonden kurzgehaltenen Vollbart, und seine Nase – die Nase seiner Mutter – lag auffallend platt auf der Oberlippe. Doktor Moritz, mit flacher Brust und gelblichem Teint, zeigte in lebhaftem Gespräch seine spitzigen, lückenhaften Zähne. Beide Brüder hatten ihre Damen bei sich, denn auch der Rechtsgelehrte war seit mehreren Jahren verheiratet, und zwar mit einem Fräulein Puttfarken aus Hamburg, einer Dame mit butterfarbenem Haar und übermäßig leidenschaftslosen, augenscheinlich anglisierenden, aber außerordentlich schönen und regelmäßigen Gesichtszügen, denn Doktor Hagenström hätte es mit seinem Rufe als Schöngeist nicht vereinbaren können, ein häßliches Mädchen zu ehelichen. Schließlich waren noch die kleine Tochter von Hermann Hagenström und der kleine Sohn von Moritz Hagenström zugegen, zwei weißgekleidete Kinder, die schon jetzt sogut wie miteinander verlobt waren, denn das Huneus-Hagenströmsche Vermögen sollte nicht verzettelt werden. – Alle aßen Rührei mit Schinken.","Indeed, up there on the third floor of the wooded terrace, the principal members of these two favorably related families sat at two tables drawn together, and ate amid animated conversation. Old Senator Möllendorpf presided, a pale gentleman with white, thin, pointed sideburns; he was diabetic. His wife, née Langhals, fiddled with her long-handled lorgnette, and her gray hair was still untidy about her head. Her son was there, August, a blond young man of well-to-do appearance and Julchen's husband, nee Hagenstrom, who was small, lively, with large, bright, black eyes and almost as large diamonds on her earlobes, between her brothers Hermann and Moritz sat. Consul Hermann Hagenstrom began to grow very strong, for he lived splendidly and it was said that he would start eating foie gras first thing in the morning. He wore a reddish-blond cropped beard and his nose—his mother's nose—was conspicuously flat on his upper lip. Doctor Moritz, with a flat chest and a yellowish complexion, showed his pointed, gapped teeth in lively conversation. Both brothers had their wives with them, for the jurist too had been married for several years, to a Fraulein Puttfarken from Hamburg, a lady with butter-colored hair and excessively dispassionate, apparently Anglicizing, but extraordinarily beautiful and regular features, such as Doctor Hagenstrom had cannot reconcile marrying an ugly girl with his reputation as an esthete. Finally, Hermann Hagenstrom's little daughter and Moritz Hagenstrom's little son were also present, two children dressed in white who were already as good as engaged to each other, because the Huneus-Hagenstrom fortune was not to be wasted. – Everyone ate scrambled eggs with ham.","And, indeed, there on the third tier of the wooded terrace were the principal members of the two families, now related by marriage to their mutual advantage. Two tables had been joined together, and there they sat, eating and conversing breezily. Old Senator Möllendorpf presided—a pallid, diabetic gentleman with sparse white whiskers that ended in two points. His wife, née Langhals, was fidgeting with her long-handled lorgnette, and as always disheveled gray hair framed her face. Their son was there, too— August, a blond young man who exuded prosperity; with him was his wife, Julie, née Hagenström, who was sitting between her brothers, Hermann and Moritz—a short, energetic woman with large bright black eyes and equally large diamonds dangling from her earlobes. Consul Hermann Hagenström was beginning to get quite stout, for he lived very well, and it was said that he even started his day with pâté de foie gras. He sported a reddish blond, short-cropped beard and his flat nose—his mother’s nose—lay conspicuously flat against his upper lip. Moritz still had his shallow chest and yellow complexion, and his pointed gap-teeth showed whenever he spoke in his lively way. Both brothers had their wives with them—lawyer Moritz had married several years before as well: a Fräulein Puttfarken from Hamburg, a lady with butter-colored hair and an exceptionally impassive, decidedly English-looking face, with beautiful and terribly regular features. Moritz Hagenström would never have compromised his reputation as a man of taste and wit by marrying an ugly girl. Also present were Hermann Hagenström’s little daughter and Moritz’s little son—two children dressed in white, who were already as good as engaged to one another, because the Huneus-Hagenström fortune was not to be scattered and lost. They were all eating scrambled eggs and ham.","There, on the third landing of the wooded terrace, sat the principal members of those affiliated families, at two tables shoved close together, eating and talking with the greatest gusto. Old Senator Mbllendorpf presided, a pallid gentle-man with thin, pointed white mutton-chops; he suffered from diabetes. His wife, born Langhals, wielded her lorgnon; and, as usual, her hair stood up untidily all over her head. Her son Augustus was a blond young man with a prosperous ex-terior, and there was Julie his wife, born Hagenstrbm, little and lively, with great blank black eyes and diamond ear-rings that were nearly as large. She sat between her brothers, Hermann and Moritz. Consul Hermann Hagenstrom had be-gun to get very stout with good living: people said he be-gan the day with pate de foie gras. He wore a full, short reddish-blond beard, and he had his mother's nose, which came down quite flat on the upper lip. Dr. Morris was nar-row-chested and yellow-skinned, and he talked very gaily, showing pointed teeth with gaps between them. Both brothers had their ladies with them--for the lawyer had married, some years since, a Fraulein Puttfarken from Hamburg, a lady with butter-coloured hair and wonderful cold, regular, English features of more than common beauty; Dr. Hagen-strbm had not been able to reconcile with his reputation as connoisseur the idea of taking a plain wife. And, finally, there were the little daughter of Hermann and the little son of Moritz, two white-frocked children, already as good as betrothed to each other, for the Huneus-Hagenstrbm money 345 must be kept together, of course. They all sat there eating ham and scrambled eggs."

"Man bestärkte einander in dem Entschlusse, geduldig auszuharren. Man begann, sich an das Geräusch zu gewöhnen, das dort draußen anschwoll, abnahm, pausierte und wieder einsetzte. Man fing an, ruhiger zu werden, sich's bequemer zu machen, sich auf den unteren Sitzreihen und den Stühlen niederzulassen … Die Betriebsamkeit all dieser tüchtigen Bürger begann sich zu regen … Man wagte hie und da, über Geschäfte zu sprechen, hie und da sogar ein Geschäft zu machen … Die Makler näherten sich den Großkaufleuten … Die eingeschlossenen Herren plauderten miteinander wie Leute, die während eines heftigen Gewitters beisammen sitzen, von anderen Dingen reden und manchmal mit ernsten und respektvollen Gesichtern auf den Donner horchen. Es wurde fünf Uhr, halb sechs Uhr, und die Dämmerung sank. Dann und wann seufzte jemand darüber, daß seine Frau mit dem Kaffee warte, worauf Herr Benthien sich erlaubte, die Dachluke in Erinnerung zu bringen. Aber die meisten dachten darüber wie Herr Stuht, der mit einem fatalistischen Kopfschütteln erklärte: »Ich bin ja doch zu dick dazu!«","They encouraged one another in their resolve to endure patiently. One began to get used to the sound out there rising, waning, pausing and then resuming. People began to calm down, to settle down more comfortably, in the lower rows of seats and in the chairs... The activity of all these capable citizens began to stir... Here and there one dared to talk about business, here and there even a To do business... The brokers approached the merchants... The shut-in gentlemen chatted to one another like people who sit together during a violent thunderstorm, talking of other things and sometimes listening to the thunder with serious and respectful faces. It was five o'clock, half past five, and dusk was falling. Now and then someone would sigh that his wife was waiting with the coffee, whereupon Herr Benthien allowed himself to recall the skylight. But most of them thought like Mr. Stuht, who declared with a fatalistic shake of the head: ""I'm too fat for that!""","They bolstered one another in their decision to wait it out patiently.

These beleaguered gentlemen chatted like people sitting out a violent thunderstorm together, speaking of this and that, but pausing now and then with serious and respectful faces to listen to the thunder. Five o’clock came, five-thirty—dusk fell. Now and then someone might sigh that his wife had coffee waiting for him at home, which Herr Benthien would take as a cue to mention the trapdoor again.

They began to get used to the noise that rose and fell outside, to feel quieter; to make themselves more comfortable, to sit down on the lower benches and chairs. The natural instinct toward industry, common to all these good burghers, began to assert itself: they ventured to bargain a little, to pick up a little business here and there. The brok-ers sat down by the wholesale dealers. These beleaguered gentlemen talked together like people shut in by a sudden storm, who speak of other things, and now and then pause to listen with respectful faces to the thunder. It was five o'clock--half-past five. It was getting dark. Now and then some-body sighed and said that the wife would be waiting with the coffee--and then Herr Benthien would venture to mention the trap-do or. But most of them were like Herr Stuht, who said fatalistically, shaking his head, ""I'm too fat."""

"Es lag kein besonderer Grund vor zu freudigen Veranstaltungen. Die Gesichter waren nicht eben glückstrahlend und die Unterhaltung nicht eben heiter bewegt. Worüber sollte man plaudern? Es gab nicht viel Erfreuliches in der Welt. Man gedachte der seligen Mutter, sprach über den Hausverkauf, über die helle Etage, die Frau Permaneder vorm Holstentore in einem freundlichen Hause angesichts der Anlagen des »Lindenplatzes« gemietet hatte, und über das, was geschehen werde, wenn Hugo Weinschenk wieder auf freiem Fuße wäre … Inzwischen spielte der kleine Johann auf dem Flügel einiges, was er mit Herrn Pfühl geübt hatte, und begleitete seiner Mutter, etwas fehlerhaft, aber mit schönem Klange, eine Sonate von Mozart. Er wurde belobt und geküßt, mußte dann aber von Ida Jungmann zur Ruhe gebracht werden, da er heute abend, noch infolge einer kaum überstandenen Darmaffektion, sehr blaß und matt aussah.","There was no special reason for joyful events.

At intervals little Johann played on the piano something which he had been learning with Herr Pfiihl, or accompanied his mother, not faultlessly, but with a lovely singing tone, in a Mozart sonata.

"… Was Christian betraf, so schien er sich zunächst mit wirklichem Eifer und Vergnügen seiner Tätigkeit zu widmen; ja, er schien sich ausnehmend wohl und zufrieden darin zu befinden und hatte während mehrerer Tage eine Art, mit Appetit zu essen, seine kurze Pfeife zu rauchen und seine Schultern in dem englischen Jackett zurechtzuschieben, die seiner behaglichen Genugtuung Ausdruck gab. Er ging morgens ungefähr gleichzeitig mit Thomas ins Kontor hinunter und nahm neben Herrn Marcus und seinem Bruder schräg gegenüber in seinem verstellbaren Armsessel Platz, denn er hatte wie die beiden Chefs einen Armsessel. Zunächst las er die »Anzeigen«, wobei er in Gemütlichkeit seine Morgenzigarette zu Ende rauchte. Dann holte er sich aus dem unteren Pultschranke einen alten Kognak, streckte die Arme aus, um sich Bewegungsfreiheit zu verschaffen, sagte »Na!« und ging, während er die Zunge zwischen den Zähnen umherwandern ließ, guten Mutes zur Arbeit über.

In the morning he went down to the office at about the same time as Thomas and sat down diagonally opposite in his adjustable armchair next to Herr Marcus and his brother, because he had an armchair like the two bosses. First he read the ""Advertisements"" while leisurely finishing his morning cigarette. Then he fetched an old cognac from the lower desk, stretched out his arms to give himself freedom of movement, said ""Well!"" and, while he let his tongue wander between his teeth, went to work in good spirits. His English letters were extraordinarily fluent and effective, for just as he spoke English, quintessentially, unchosenly, indifferently and effortlessly dabbled along, so he wrote it.","That sort of thing was quite foreign to his partner. As for Christian, he appeared at first to throw himself into his work with zest and pleasure; indeed, he seemed to take increasing satisfaction in it; for several days he ate with a good appetite and had a way of smoking his stubby pipe and squaring his shoulders inside his English jacket that expressed just how comfortable and satisfied he felt. He would go down to the office at about the same time as Thomas and take his seat beside Herr Marcus and catercorner from his brother—in the same kind of adjustable armchair the two partners used.

"Es war anders mit Christian.

"Bei dieser Unterhaltung aber geschah das Merkwürdige, daß in dem kleinen Kai sich das Bedürfnis zu regen und auszubilden begann, es dem Buche gleichzutun und selbst etwas zu erzählen, und das war um so erwünschter, als man die gedruckten Märchen allmählich alle kannte, und auch Ida sich dann und wann ein wenig ausruhen mußte. Kais Geschichten waren anfangs kurz und einfach, wurden dann aber kühner und komplizierter und gewannen an Interesse dadurch, daß sie nicht gänzlich in der Luft standen, sondern von der Wirklichkeit ausgingen und diese in ein seltsames und geheimnisvolles Licht rückten … Besonders gern vernahm Hanno die Erzählung von einem bösen, aber außerordentlich mächtigen Zauberer, der einen schönen und hochbegabten Prinzen mit Namen Josephus in der Gestalt eines bunten Vogels bei sich gefangen halte und alle Menschen mit seinen tückischen Künsten quäle. Schon aber wachse in der Ferne der Auserwählte heran, welcher dereinst an der Spitze einer unwiderstehlichen Armee von Hunden, Hühnern und Meerschweinchen gegen den Zauberer furchtlos zu Felde ziehen und den Prinzen, sowie die ganze Welt, besonders aber Hanno Buddenbrook vermittels eines Schwertstreiches von ihm erlösen werde. Dann werde, befreit und entzaubert, Josephus in sein Reich zurückkehren, König werden und Hanno sowohl wie Kai zu sehr hohen Würden emporsteigen lassen …","During this conversation, however, the strange thing happened that little Kai began to feel the need to do the same as the book and to tell something himself, and that was all the more desirable as one gradually knew all the printed fairy tales, and also Now and then Ida had to rest a little. Kai's stories were short and simple at first, but then became bolder and more complicated and gained interest because they weren't entirely up in the air, but proceeded from reality and cast it in a strange and mysterious light... Hanno particularly enjoyed hearing the story of an evil but extraordinarily powerful magician who keeps a beautiful and highly talented prince named Josephus in the form of a colorful bird captive and torments all people with his treacherous arts. But the chosen one is already growing up in the distance, who will one day fearlessly campaign at the head of an irresistible army of dogs, chickens and guinea pigs against the magician and save the prince and the whole world, but especially Hanno Buddenbrook, from him by means of a sword stroke become. Then, freed and disenchanted, Josephus will return to his kingdom, become king and allow both Hanno and Kai to rise to very high ranks...","But now something remarkable happened. Little Kai increasingly showed an interest in developing his own talents, wanted to imitate the book and tell stories of his own; and that was all the more welcome because it was not long before they knew the printed fairy tales, and Ida needed a rest now and then, too. At first Kai’s stories were short and simple; they soon grew bolder, however, and more complicated—and more interesting, because they were not pure fabrications but had some basis in reality, but a reality bathed in a strange and mysterious light. Hanno especially liked to listen to the story about an evil but extraordinarily powerful magician, who tormented everyone with his wicked spells and had changed a handsome and very clever prince named Josephus into a brightly colored bird that he held captive in a cage. But there was a boy in a faraway land, and he had been chosen to become a fearless hero and would grow up one day to lead an invincible army of dogs, chickens, and guinea pigs into battle against the magician, and with a single stroke of his sword he would rescue the whole world and the prince—and especially Hanno Buddenbrook—from the magician’s evil power. And once the charm was broken and he was free, Josephus would return to his kingdom, become a king, and promote Hanno and Kai to high positions.","But after a while Kai, who possessed the constant craving to do something himself, to have some effect on his surroundings, would close the book and begin to tell stories himself. It was a good idea, for they knew all the printed ones, and Ida needrd a rest sometimes, too. Kai's stories were short and simple at first, but they expanded and grew bolder and more complicated with time. The interesting thing about them was that they never stood quite in the air, but were based upon a reality which he presented in a new and mysterious light. Hanno particularly liked the one about the wicked enchanter who tortured all human beings by his malignant art; who had captured a beautiful prince named Josephus and turned him into a green-and-red parrot, which he kept in a gilded cage. But in a far distant land the chosen hero was growing up, who should one day fearlessly advance at the head of an invincible army of dogs, chickens, and guinea-pigs and slay the base enchanter with a single sword-thrust, and deliver all the world--in particular, Hanno Buddenbrook--from his clutches. Then Josephus would be restored to his proper form and return to his kingdom, in which Kai and Hanno would be appointed to high offices."

Kaum aber war aus dieser unscheinbaren Hülle der goldgelbe, traubensüße alte Malvasier in die kleinen Dessertweingläser geflossen, als der Augenblick gekommen war, da Pastor Wunderlich sich erhob und, während das Gespräch verstummte, das Glas in der Hand, in angenehmen Wendungen zu toasten begann.

But no sooner had the golden-yellow, grape-sweet old Malvasia flowed out of this inconspicuous shell into the small dessert wine glasses than the moment came when Pastor Wunderlich got up and, while the conversation fell silent, glass in hand, began toasting in pleasant turns. He spoke, his head tilted a little to the side, a delicate and playful smile on his white face, and moving his free hand in dainty little gestures, in the free and easy conversational tone that he also loved to pause in the pulpit... so feel free, my brave friends, to drink a glass of this nice drop with me to the welfare of our much honored hosts in their new, so magnificent home - to the welfare of the Buddenbrook family, the present as well as the absent members ... lively high!«","“Thomas, my boy, would you be so good,” Johann Buddenbrook said and pulled a large ring of keys from his trouser pocket. “In the second cellar, on the right, the second bin, behind the red Bordeaux, two bottles, you hear?” And Thomas, who was well versed in such tasks, ran off and returned with two very dusty and cobwebbed bottles. And no sooner had the yellow-gold, fruity-sweet vintage Madeira been poured from its humble container into little dessert-wine glasses, than conversation fell away and Pastor Wunderlich stood up, glass in hand, to begin his gracefully phrased toast. His head a little to one side, a subtle and waggish smile playing over his white face, his free hand tracing little delicate gestures, he spoke in the same genial and easy conversational tone he loved to employ in the pulpit. “And now, stalwart friends, be so kind as to join me in emptying a glass of this pleasant nectar with good wishes for the prosperity of our most honored hosts in their new and splendid home—to the Buddenbrook family, both present and absent.

Now the moment came when Pastor Wunderlich rose, glass in hand, to propose a toast; and the company fell silent to listen. He spoke in the pleasant, conversational tone which he liked to use in the pulpit; his head a little on one side, a subtle, humorous smile on his pale face, gesturing easily with his free hand.

"Was aber Madame Permaneder anging, so war sie glücklich, so äußerte ihre lichte Gemütsstimmung sich in Aperçus wie dieses, daß das irdische Leben doch hin und wieder auch seine guten Seiten habe. Wahrhaftig, sie erblühte aufs neue in diesen Wochen, die, mit ihrer belebenden Geschäftigkeit, ihren vielfältigen Plänen, ihren Wohnungssorgen und ihrem Ausstattungsfieber, sie allzu deutlich an die Zeit ihres eignen ersten Verlöbnisses gemahnten, als daß sie sie nicht verjüngt und mit grenzenloser Hoffnungsfreudigkeit erfüllt hätten. Viel von dem graziösen Übermut ihrer Mädchentage kehrte in ihre Mienen und ihre Bewegungen zurück, ja, die Stimmung eines ganzen Jerusalemsabends entweihte sie durch eine so ausgelassene Fröhlichkeit, daß selbst Lea Gerhardt das Buch ihres Vorfahren sinken ließ und mit den großen, unwissenden und mißtrauischen Augen der Tauben im Saale umherblickte …","But as far as Madame Permaneder was concerned, she was happy, her light mood expressed itself in apercus like this, that earthly life had its good sides every now and then. Truly, she blossomed anew in these weeks, which, with their invigorating activity, their varied plans, their housing worries, and their furnishing fever, reminded her too clearly of the time of her first engagement not to rejuvenate her and fill her with boundless hopefulness had.

Much of her earlier girlish charm and high spirits returned to her face and gestures. In fact, her boisterous merriment proved such a profanation of the atmosphere on one particular Jerusalem Evening that even Lea Gerhardt let her ancestor’s book fall to her lap and looked about the room with the large, oblivious, and mistrustful eyes of the deaf.","Madame Permaneder, at this period of the family's history, was in such a joyful mood that her happiness found vent in shrewd observations about life: how, when all was said and done, it had its good side.

"Jeder Mensch begreift, daß Johann Buddenbrooks erster und aufrichtigster Beschluß dahin ging, eine Auszahlung irgendwelcher Höhe an seinen Schwiegersohn nach Kräften zu vermeiden. Als er sich aber erinnerte, wie dringend er, um ein gelindes Wort zu gebrauchen, diese Ehe befürwortet hatte, als er sich den Blick ins Gedächtnis zurückrief, mit dem das Kind nach der Hochzeitsfeier von ihm Abschied genommen und ihn gefragt hatte: »Bist du mit mir zufrieden?«, da mußte er einem ziemlich niederdrückenden Schuldbewußtsein seiner Tochter gegenüber Raum geben und sich sagen, daß diese Sache ganz und gar durch ihren Willen entschieden werden müsse. Er wußte wohl, daß sie in diese Verbindung nicht aus Gründen der Liebe gewilligt hatte, aber er rechnete mit der Möglichkeit, daß diese vier Jahre, die Gewöhnung und die Geburt des Kindes vieles verändert haben konnten, daß Tony sich jetzt ihrem Manne mit Leib und Seele verbunden fühlen und aus guten christlichen und weltlichen Gründen jeden Gedanken an eine Trennung zurückweisen konnte. In diesem Falle, überlegte der Konsul, müsse er sich zur Hergabe jeder Geldsumme bequemen. Zwar verlangten Christenpflicht und Frauenwürde, daß Tony ihrem angetrauten Gatten bedingungslos auch ins Unglück folgte; wenn sie aber tatsächlich diesen Entschluß an den Tag legen würde, so fühlte er sich nicht berechtigt, sie fortan alle die Verschönerungen und Bequemlichkeiten des Lebens, an die sie von Kindesbeinen an gewöhnt war, unverschuldet entbehren zu lassen … so fühlte er sich verpflichtet, eine Katastrophe zu verhüten und B. Grünlich um jeden Preis zu halten. Kurz, das Ergebnis seiner Erwägungen war der Wunsch gewesen, seine Tochter mitsamt ihrem Kinde zu sich zu nehmen und Herrn Grünlich seiner Wege gehen zu lassen. Mochte Gott dies Äußerste verhüten! Für jeden Fall bewegte er den Rechtsparagraphen bei sich, der bei bestehender Unfähigkeit des Gatten, Frau und Kinder zu ernähren, zur Scheidung berechtigte. Vor allem aber mußte er die Ansichten seiner Tochter erforschen …","Everyone understands that Johann Buddenbrook's first and most sincere decision was to avoid paying any amount to his son-in-law as far as he could. But when he recalled how urgently he had, to use the mildest word, advocated this marriage, when he recalled the look with which the child had said goodbye to him after the wedding celebration and asked him: ""Are you satisfied with me?' he had to give way to a rather crushing sense of guilt towards his daughter and tell himself that this matter must be decided entirely by her will. He knew very well that she had not agreed to this union for reasons of love, but he reckoned with the possibility that these four years, getting used to it and the birth of the child, could have changed a lot, that Tony could now give himself to her husband with body and soul soul connected and could reject any thought of separation for good Christian and worldly reasons. In that case, the Consul reflected, he would have to agree to hand over any sum of money. It is true that the duty of a Christian and the dignity of a woman demanded that Tony follow her wedded husband unconditionally, even in misfortune; but if she actually made that decision, he didn't feel justified in letting her, through no fault of her own, henceforth be deprived of all the embellishments and comforts of life to which she had been accustomed since childhood... so he felt obliged to make one To prevent catastrophe and to keep B. Grünlich at all costs. In short, the result of his considerations was the desire to take his daughter and her child with him and to let Herr Grünlich go his own way. May God forbid this extreme! In any case, he brought up the legal paragraph that gave the right to divorce if the husband was unable to support his wife and children. Above all, however, he had to investigate his daughter's views...","It is easy to understand that Johann Buddenbrook’s first and most candid impulse was to do everything possible to avoid a payment in any amount to his son-in-law. But when he recalled how strongly he had advocated this marriage, to use a mild term, when he remembered the look the child had given him as she said goodbye after her wedding and asked him, “Are you proud of me?”—then he had to admit his own rather heavy guilt in regard to his daughter’s situation and to tell himself that this matter would have to be decided entirely as she wanted. He was well aware that she had not agreed to the marriage out of love, but he thought it possible that four years of a life together and the birth of a child might have changed a great many things, that Tony might feel bound to her husband now, body and soul, and reject any notion of separation for reasons both Christian and worldly. In that case, the consul decided, he would have to make the best of it and hand over whatever sum was necessary. To be sure, honor and duty, both as a Christian and as a wife, demanded that Tony follow the spouse entrusted to her into any misfortune, no matter what; but if it became evident that this was indeed her decision, then he did not feel justified in asking her to forgo, through no fault of her own, all the amenities and comforts of a life she had known since earliest childhood; he would be duty-bound to avoid a catastrophe and to keep B. Grünlich afloat no matter what the cost. In brief, the upshot of all his reflections was a desire to take his daughter and her child home with him and let Herr Grünlich go his way. God forbid that such an awful thing should happen. But just in case, he had given much thought to the section of the legal code that permitted divorce should a husband prove incapable of supporting his wife and children. And above all, he had to sound out his daughter’s true feelings.","It is comprehensible that Johann Buddenbr oak's first im-pulse was to refuse his son-in-law any considerable payment. But when he remembered how pressing--to use a mild word--he had been about this marriage; when he looked back into the past, and recalled the words: ""Are you satisfied with me?"" with which his child had taken leave of him after the wedding, he gave way to a burdensome sense of guilt against her and said to himself that the thing must be decided ac-cording to her feelings. He knew perfectly that she had not made the marriage out of love, but he was obliged to reckon with the possibility that these four years of life to-gether and the birth of the child had changed matters; that Tony now felt bound body and soul to her husband and would be driven by considerations both spiritual and worldly to shrink from a separation. In such a case, the Consul argued, he must accommodate himself to the surrender of whatever sum was necessary. Christian duty and wifely feeling did indeed demand that Tony should follow her husband into misfortune; and if she actually took this resolve, he did not feel justified in letting her be deprived of all the ease and comfort to which she had been accustomed since child-hood. He would feel himself obliged to avert the catastro-phe, and to support B. Griinliuh at any price. Yet the final 215 result of his considerations was the desire to take his daugh-ter and her child home with him and let Driinlich go his own way. God forbid that the worst should happen! In any case, the Consul invoked the pronouncement of the law that a continued inability to provide for wife and chil-dren justified a separation. But, before everything, he must find out his daughter's real feelings."

"Er war ein Sonderling, den selten jemand zu sehen bekam, und der, beschäftigt mit Hühner-, Hunde- und Gemüsezucht, abgeschieden von aller Welt auf seinem kleinen Gehöfte hauste: ein großer Mann mit Stulpenstiefeln, einer grünen Friesjoppe, kahlem Kopfe, einem ungeheuren ergrauten Rübezahlbarte, einer Reitpeitsche in der Hand, obgleich er durchaus kein Pferd besaß, und einem unter der buschigen Braue ins Auge geklemmten Monokel. Es gab, außer ihm und seinem Sohne, weit und breit keinen Grafen Mölln mehr im Lande. Die einzelnen Zweige der ehemals reichen, mächtigen und stolzen Familie waren nach und nach verdorrt, abgestorben und vermodert, und nur eine Tante des kleinen Kai, mit der sein Vater aber nicht in Korrespondenz stand, war noch am Leben. Sie veröffentlichte unter einem abenteuerlichen Pseudonym Romane in Familienblättern. – Was den Grafen Eberhard betraf, so erinnerte man sich, daß er, um sich vor allen Störungen durch Anfragen, Angebote und Bettelei zu schützen, während längerer Zeit, nachdem er das Anwesen vorm Burgtor bezogen, ein Schild an seiner niedrigen Haustür geführt hatte, auf dem zu lesen gewesen: »Hier wohnt Graf Mölln ganz allein, braucht nichts, kauft nichts und hat nichts zu verschenken.« Als das Schild seine Wirkung getan und niemand ihn mehr belästigte, hatte er es wieder entfernt.","He was an eccentric who seldom got to see anyone, and who lived on his small farm away from everyone else, busy raising chickens, dogs and vegetables: a tall man with top-boots, a green frieze jacket, a bald head, an enormous one with a graying beard, a riding crop in his hand, although he didn't own a horse at all, and a monocle tucked under his bushy brow. Apart from him and his son, there was no longer a Count Mölln in the country far and wide. The individual branches of the once rich, powerful and proud family had gradually withered, died and decayed, and only one aunt of little Kai, with whom his father did not correspond, was still alive. She published novels in family newspapers under an adventurous pseudonym. - As far as Count Eberhard was concerned, it was remembered that, in order to protect himself from all disturbances through inquiries, offers and begging, he had kept a sign on his low front door for a long time after he had moved into the property in front of the castle gate, which read: ""Count Mölln lives here all by himself, doesn't need anything, doesn't buy anything and has nothing to give away."" When the sign had had its effect and no one bothered him anymore, he had removed it again.","He was an eccentric, whom people seldom saw—a recluse who had forsaken the world for this little farm, where he bred chickens and dogs and grew vegetables: a tall, bald man who wore top boots and a green frieze jacket and sported a huge grizzled beard worthy of a troll. He always had a riding crop in his hand, although he did not own a single horse, and there was a monocle clamped in one eye, under a bushy brow. Apart from him and his son, there was no longer a single Count Mölln to be found anywhere in the country. The various branches of this once rich, powerful, and proud family had withered, died, and rotted away, and little Kai had only one aunt who was still alive—and his father was not on speaking terms with her. She published novels, written under a bizarre pseudonym, in various family magazines. What people remembered about Count Eberhard was that, shortly after he had moved onto the farm out beyond the Burg Gate, a sign appeared on the low front door warning salesmen, beggars, or anyone else making inquiries not to bother him; the sign read: “Here lives Count Mölln, all alone. He needs nothing, buys nothing, and has nothing to give away.” The sign had stayed there some time, until it served its purpose and no one bothered him anymore. Then he had taken it down.","He was an eccentric, hardly ever seen by anybody, busy on his dunghill with his dogs, his chickens, and his vegetable-patch: a large man in top-boots, with a green frie/e jacket. He had a bald head and a huge grey beard like the tail of a turnip; he carried a riding-whip in his hand, though he had no horse to his name, and wore a monorlc Muck inlu his eve under the bushy eyebrow. Except him and his son, there was no Count Molln in all the length and breadth of the land any more: the various branches of a onre rich, proud, and powerful family had gradually withered olT, until now there was only an aunt, with whom Kai's father was not on terms. She wrote romances for the family story-papers, un-der a dashing pseudonym. The story was told of Count Eber-hard that when he Rrst withdrew to his little farm, he devised a means of protecting himself from the importunities of ped-dlers, beggars, and busy-bodies. He put up a sign which read: ""Here lives Count Molln. He wants nothing, buys nothing, and gives nothing away. "" When the sign had served its purpose, he removed it."

Die Enkelin des noblen Lebrecht Kröger erglühte in Bewunderung für Armgards Adel, und im geheimen dachte sie manchmal, daß für sie selbst dieses prächtige »von« eigentlich viel besser gepaßt haben würde, – denn Armgard, mein Gott, sie wußte ihr Glück nicht einmal zu schätzen, sie ging umher mit ihrem dicken Zopf, ihren gutmütigen blauen Augen und ihrer breiten mecklenburgischen Aussprache und dachte gar nicht daran; sie war durchaus nicht vornehm, sie machte nicht den geringsten Anspruch darauf, sie hatte keinen Sinn für Vornehmheit. Dieses Wort »vornehm« saß erstaunlich fest in Tonys Köpfchen, und sie wandte es mit anerkennendem Nachdruck auf Gerda Arnoldsen an.","This Armgard had made the greatest impression on Tony from the first moment, as the first noblewoman she had come into contact with. What luck to be called Von Schilling! The parents had the nicest old house in town and the grandparents were noble people; but their names were quite simply ""Buddenbrook"" and ""Kröger,"" and that was a great pity. The granddaughter of the noble Lebrecht Kröger glowed with admiration for Armgard's nobility, and secretly she sometimes thought that for herself this magnificent ""of"" would actually have fitted much better - for Armgard, my God, she didn't even know how lucky she was Guess she walked around with her thick braid, her good-natured blue eyes and her broad Mecklenburg accent and didn't even think about it; she wasn't noble at all, she didn't make the slightest claim to be, she had no sense of distinction. That word 'genteel' stuck surprisingly firmly in Tony's mind, and she applied it to Gerda Arnoldsen with appreciative emphasis.","From the first moment, it was Armgard who made the greatest impression on Tony, and that was because Armgard was the first girl she had ever actually known from a noble family. To be called von Schilling, how wonderful that must be! Her parents had the most beautiful old house in town, and her grandparents were prominent people; but their names were simply “Buddenbrook” and “Kröger,” and that was a dreadful shame. Armgard’s noble status made the granddaughter of the stylish Lebrecht Kröger flush with admiration; but secretly she sometimes thought that that splendid syllable von would actually suit her far better—because, good heavens, Armgard hadn’t the vaguest how lucky she was. She walked around with those good-natured blue eyes, that heavy braid, that broad Mecklenburg accent—and never gave it a thought. She wasn’t at all elegant, didn’t make the slightest claim to be, hadn’t any notion what elegance was. But the word “elegant” was firmly fixed in Tony’s little head, and she was most emphatic about applying it to Gerda Arnoldsen.","It was Armgard who from the earliest moment had made a great impression on Tony. She was the first person from a 85 noble family whom Tony had ever known. What luck, to be called von Schilling! Her own parents had the most beauti-ful old house in the town, and her grandparents belonged to the best families; still, they were called plain Buddenbrook and Kr�ger--which was a pity, to be sure. The grand-daughter of the proud Lebrecht Kr�ger glowed with reverence for Armgard's noble birth. Privately, she sometimes thought that the splendid ""von"" went with her better than it did with Armgard; for Armgard did not appreciate her good luck, dear, no! She had a thick pigtail, good-natured blue eyes, and a broad Mecklenburg accent, and went about thinking just nothing at all on the subject. She made absolutely no pretentions to being aristocratic; in fact, she did not know what it was. But the word ""aristocratic"" stuck in Tony's small head; and she emphatically applied it to Gerda Arnoldsen."
"Im Penseezimmer bewegte sie sich mit der kleinen messingnen Brause umher, um die schwarze Erde der Blattgewächse zu tränken. Sie liebte ihre Palmen sehr, die so prachtvoll zur Vornehmheit der Wohnung beitrugen. Sie betastete behutsam einen jungen Trieb an einem der dicken, runden Schäfte, prüfte zärtlich die majestätisch entfalteten Fächer und entfernte hie und da eine gelbe Spitze mit der Schere … Plötzlich horchte sie auf. Die Unterredung im Rauchzimmer, die schon seit mehreren Minuten einen lebhaften Klang angenommen hatte, ward jetzt so laut, daß man hier drinnen jedes Wort verstand, obgleich die Türe stark und die Portiere schwer war.","In the Pensee room she moved about with the little brass shower to soak the black soil of the leafy plants. She was very fond of her palm trees, which added so magnificently to the grandeur of the apartment. She carefully felt a young shoot on one of the thick, round shafts, tenderly examined the majestically unfolded fans and here and there removed a yellow tip with scissors... Suddenly she listened. The conversation in the smoking-room, which had been lively for several minutes, now grew so loud that every word was heard inside, although the door was strong and the portiere heavy.","In the pensée room she wandered about with the little brass sprinkling can, watering the black earth of the various plants. She loved her palm trees very much, they added such splendid elegance to the house. She cautiously fingered a new sprout on one of the thick, round stems, tenderly inspected the majestically spreading fronds, and trimmed a yellow tip here and there with the scissors. Suddenly she stopped to listen. The conversation in the smoking room, which had grown quite lively in the last few minutes, had now become so loud that she could understand every word from here, despite portieres and the heavy door.","In the ""pensee-room"" she busied herself with a little brass sprinkler, watering the black earth around her plants. She loved her palms, they gave so much elegance to the room. She touched carefully a young shoot on one of the thick round stems, examined the majestically unfolded fans, and cut away a yellow tip here and there with the scissors. Sud-denly she stopped. The conversation in the next room, which had for several minutes been assuming a livelier tone, became so loud that she could hear every word, though the door and the portieres were both heavy."
"»So, darfst du das? – Sage mal, mein Sohn Filius, wäre es nicht am Ende angebrachter, du setztest dich auf deine Stube und repetiertest deine Nervenstränge? Du hast alles vergessen, bis du wieder nach Göttingen kommst …«","""So, can you do that? – Tell me, my son Filius, wouldn't it be more appropriate in the end if you sat down in your room and repeated your nerve cords? You'll have forgotten everything by the time you come back to Göttingen...""","“Oh, you were, were you?

"»Nein, nein!« sagte Tony plötzlich in tröstendem Ton. Ihre Tränen waren versiegt, Rührung und Mitleid stiegen in ihr auf. Mein Gott, wie sehr mußte er sie lieben, daß er diese Sache, die ihr selbst innerlich ganz fremd und gleichgültig war, so weit trieb! War es möglich, daß sie dies erlebte? In Romanen las man dergleichen, und nun lag im gewöhnlichen Leben ein Herr im Gehrock vor ihr auf den Knien und flehte!… Ihr war der Gedanke, ihn zu heiraten, einfach unsinnig erschienen, weil sie Herrn Grünlich albern gefunden hatte. Aber, bei Gott, in diesem Augenblicke war er durchaus nicht albern! Aus seiner Stimme und seinem Gesicht sprach eine so ehrliche Angst, eine so aufrichtige und verzweifelte Bitte …","'No, no!' said Tony suddenly in a comforting tone. Her tears had dried up, emotion and pity rose up in her. My God, how much he must have loved her to take this matter, which was completely alien and indifferent to her, so far! Was it possible that she experienced this? You read about that in novels, and now in everyday life a gentleman in a frock coat was on his knees in front of her and begging!... The thought of marrying him had just seemed nonsensical to her, because she had found Mr. Grünlich silly. But, by God, he wasn't being silly at that moment! There was such genuine fear in his voice and face, such sincere and desperate plea...","“No, no!” Tony replied, her voice suddenly consoling. Her tears had stopped, and compassion and pity welled up within her. Lord, how very much he must love her to take this so far, when all it aroused in her was a queer feeling of indifference. Was it possible that this was happening to her? You read about this sort of thing in novels, but now here in the flesh was a man in a frock coat, on his knees, begging. The thought of marrying him had simply seemed absurd, because she found Herr Grünlich silly. But, by God, at that moment he was not silly at all. There was such sincere anguish in his voice and in his face, such honesty and despair in his pleas.…","""No, no,"" Tony said quickly in a consoling tone. Her tears were conquered, pity stirred. Heavens, how he must adore her, to go on like that, while she herself felt com-pletely indifferent! Was it to her, Tony Buddenbrook, that all this was happening? One read of it in the novels. But here in real life was a man in a frock-coat, on his knees in front of her, weeping, imploring. The idea of marrying him was simply idiotic, because she had found him silly; but just at this moment he did not seem silly; heavens, no! Honour-able, upright, desperate entreaty were in his voice and face."
"»Ich sehe nicht ein, lieber Freund, inwiefern meine Gegenwart … aber gleichviel. Da du es wünschest, so sei es.

"Merkwürdigerweise entgegnete Thomas hierauf durchaus nicht noch heftiger, sondern senkte schweigend den Kopf und nahm dann langsam den Weg um den Garten wieder auf. Es schien ihn zu befriedigen, ihm geradezu wohlzutun, seinen Bruder endlich in Zorn gebracht … ihn endlich zu einer energischen Erwiderung, einem Protest vermocht zu haben.","Oddly enough, Thomas didn't reply any more vehemently, but bowed his head in silence and then slowly resumed his walk around the garden. It seemed to satisfy him, to actually do him good, to have finally enraged his brother .","Strangely enough, Thomas did not react with a more violent outburst, but silently lowered his head and started slowly back on the path around the garden. It seemed to have satisfied him, to have actually done him good, finally to have made his brother angry, to have at last enabled him to react vigorously and raise some protest.","Strange to say, Thomas did not meet this outburst by more anger. He bent his head and slowly took his way around the garden. It seemed to quiet him, actually to do him good to have made his brother angry at last--to have pushed him finally to the energy of a protest."
"Dann entstand eine Pause. Leise und zögernd wandte das Gespräch sich den jüngst vergangenen Ereignissen zu, und als der Name des kleinen Johann gefallen war, ward es wieder stumm in der Stube, und nur den Regen vorm Hause hörte man stärker rauschen.","Then there was a pause. Quietly and hesitantly, the conversation turned to recent events, and when little Johann's name was mentioned, the room fell silent again, and only the rustling of the rain in front of the house could be heard louder.","Then there was a pause. Haltingly, tactfully, the conversation turned now to events just past, and when little Johann’s name was finally mentioned, the room fell silent and the murmur of the rain outside grew louder.","There was a pause. They touched delicately and with hesi-tation upon recent events, and when one of them let fall little Johann's name, it was still in the room, except for the sound of the rain, which fell faster than before."

"Die Sache war die, daß des Konsuls hinterlassenes Vermögen beträchtlicher war, als irgendein Mensch geglaubt hatte. Die Mitgift seiner ältesten Tochter freilich war verlorengegangen, die Einbuße, die die Firma gelegentlich des Bremer Konkurses im Jahre 51 erlitten, war ein schwerer Schlag gewesen. Und auch das Jahr 48 sowie das gegenwärtige Jahr 55 mit ihren Unruhen und Kriegsläuften hatten Verluste gebracht. Aber der Buddenbrooksche Anteil an der Krögerschen Hinterlassenschaft von 400000 Kurantmark hatte, da Justus eine Menge im voraus verbraucht, volle 300000 betragen, und obgleich Johann Buddenbrook nach Kaufmannsart beständig geklagt hatte, war den Verlusten doch durch einen etwa fünfzehnjährigen Verdienst von 30000 Talern Kurant die Waage gehalten worden. Das Vermögen also betrug, abgesehen von jedem Grundbesitz, in runder Zahl 750000 Mark Kurant.","The thing was, the Consul's estate was greater than any man had imagined. His eldest daughter's dowry had of course been lost, and the losses suffered by the company when it went bankrupt in Bremen in 51 had been a heavy blow. And also the year 48 as well as the current year 55 with their unrest and war had brought losses. But Buddenbrook's share of Kröger's legacy of 400,000 marketable marks had amounted to a full 300,000, since Justus used up a lot in advance, and although Johann Buddenbrook had constantly complained in the manner of a merchant, the losses were balanced by a fifteen-year earnings of 30,000 thalers been held. The assets, apart from every piece of real estate, amounted to a round figure of 750,000 marks current.","The truth was that the consul had left behind a much more considerable fortune than anyone would have imagined. To be sure, his eldest daughter’s dowry had been forfeited, and the losses the firm had suffered in that bankruptcy in Bremen in 1851 had been a heavy blow. The unrest and conflicts in both 1848 and the present year of 1855 had cost the firm as well. But the Buddenbrook share in the Kröger estate of 400,000 marks courant had come to 300,000—because Justus had already spent most of his inheritance. And although Johann Buddenbrook was forever complaining in typical businessman’s fashion, all the losses had been balanced out over the past fifteen years by a profit of some 30,000 thalers courant. Apart from real estate, then, the family fortune came to some 750,000 marks courant, in round numbers.","The truth was that the Consul's estate was more considerable than any one had supposed. The dowry of hia oldest daughter, indeed, was gone, and the losses which the firm had suffered in the Bremen failure in 1851 had been H heavy blow. And the year '48, as well as the present year '55, with their unrest and interval of war, had brought losses. But the Buddenbrook share of the Kroger estate of four hundred thousand current marks had been full three hundred thousand, for Justus had already had much of his beforehand. Johann Buddenbrook had continually complained, as a merchant will; but the losses of the firm had been made good by the accrued profits of some fifteen years, amounting to thirty thousand thaler, and thus the property, aside from real estate, amounted in round figures, to seven hundred thousand marks."

"Dann kam die Fähre, es kam die Israelsdorfer Allee, der Jerusalemsberg, das Burgfeld. Der Wagen passierte das Burgtor, neben dem zur Rechten die Mauern des Gefängnisses aufragten, er rollte die Burgstraße entlang und über den Koberg … Tony betrachtete die grauen Giebelhäuser, die über die Straße gespannten Öllampen, das Heilige-Geist-Hospital mit den schon fast entblätterten Linden davor … Mein Gott, alles das war geblieben, wie es gewesen war! Es hatte hier gestanden, unabänderlich und ehrwürdig, während sie sich daran als an einen alten, vergessenswerten Traum erinnert hatte! Diese grauen Giebel waren das Alte, Gewohnte und Überlieferte, das sie wieder aufgenommen und in dem sie nun wieder leben sollte. Sie weinte nicht mehr; sie sah sich neugierig um. Das Abschiedsleid war beinahe betäubt, angesichts dieser Straßen und dieser altbekannten Gesichter darin. In diesem Augenblick – der Wagen rasselte durch die Breite Straße – ging der Träger Matthiesen vorüber und nahm tief seinen rauhen Zylinder ab mit einem so bärbeißigen Pflichtgesicht, als dächte er: Ich wäre ja wohl ein Hundsfott …!","Then came the ferry, then came Israelsdorfer Allee, Jerusalemsberg, Burgfeld. The car passed the castle gate, next to which the walls of the prison towered on the right, it rolled along Burgstrasse and over the Koberg... Tony looked at the gray gabled houses, the oil lamps stretched across the street, the Holy Spirit Hospital with the almost defoliated ones Linden before that... My God, it was all the same! It had stood here, immutable and venerable, while she remembered it as an old dream to forget! These gray gables were the old, the familiar and the handed down, which she was to take up again and in which she was now to live again. She no longer cried; she looked around curiously. The farewell sorrow was almost numb in the face of these streets and these familiar faces in them. At that moment – the carriage rattled through Breite Strasse – Matthiesen the porter walked past and took off his rough top hat with such a gruff, dutiful face as if he were thinking: I must be a curse…!","THEN CAME THE FERRY, then Israelsdorfer Allee, then Jerusalem Hill, Castle Yard. The carriage passed through the Burg Gate, on its right the towering walls of the prison; it rolled down Burg Strasse and crossed the Koberg. Tony looked at the gray gabled buildings, the oil lamps strung across the streets, the Holy Ghost Hospital—the lindens out front had lost most of their leaves already. Good Lord, it was all just as it had been before. It had stood here, immutable and venerable, and all the while she had thought of it as an old, easily forgotten dream. These gray gables were tradition, something old and trustworthy, and they had taken her back in, and here she would live again. She was not crying now; she looked about her with curiosity. The pain of parting was almost numbed by these streets and these old familiar faces. At that moment—the carriage was rattling along Breite Strasse—Matthiesen the grain hauler passed them and doffed his homely top hat with a deep sweep of his hand, and his gruff face was so full of respect it seemed to say, “I swear I’m at the bottom of the ladder.”","THEN came the ferry, and Israelsdorf Avenue, Jerusalem Hill, the Castle Field. The wagon passed the Castle Gate, with the walls of the prison rising on the right, and rolled along Castle Street and over the Koberg. Tony looked at the grey gables, the oil lamps hung across the streets, Holy Ghost Hospital with the already almost bare lindens in front of it. Dh, how everything was exactly as it had been! It had been standing here, in immovable dignity, while she had thought of it as a dream worthy only to be forgotten. These grey gables were the old, the accustomed, the traditional, to which she was re-turning, in the midst of which she must live. She wept no more. She Iooked about curiously. The pain of parting was almost dulled at the sight of these well-known streets and faces. At that moment--the wagon was rolling through Broad Street--the porter Matthiesen passed and took off his stove-pipe hat so obsequiously that it seemed he must be thinking, ""Bow, you dog of a porter--you can't bow low enough."""
"Aber Senator Gieseke war etwas pikiert. Schließlich war er auch nur der Sohn eines Branddirektors … Nein, dem Verdienste seine Krone.

"Sie lächelte zufrieden vor sich hin … Aber da, plötzlich, vernahm sie in dem Geräusch der Räder mit vollkommener, mit unglaublich lebendiger Deutlichkeit Mortens Sprache; sie unterschied jeden Laut seiner gutmütigen, ein wenig schwerfällig knarrenden Stimme, sie hörte mit leiblichem Ohr, wie er sagte: »Heute müssen wir beide auf den Steinen sitzen, Fräulein Tony …«, und diese kleine Erinnerung überwältigte sie.

Hie und da sprangen die Häuser mit Vorbauten in die Straße hinein, die abschüssig zur Trave hinunterführte, und einige waren mit Beischlägen oder Bänken versehen. Feuchtes Gras sproß zwischen dem schlechten Pflaster empor. Die Marienkirche dort drüben lag ganz in Schatten, Dunkelheit und Regen gehüllt.","A sharp wind drove the rain down sideways, and the old Kroegers, wrapped in thick fur coats, crept hastily into their majestic carriage, which had been waiting for a long time. The yellow light of the oil lamps, which burned on poles in front of the house and hung below on thick chains stretched across the street, flickered restlessly. Here and there the houses jutted out into the street, which led down to the Trave, with porches, and some had porches or benches. Damp grass sprouted up between the bad pavement. St. Mary's Church over there lay shrouded in shadow, darkness and rain.","A cutting wind was blowing the rain aslant, and the old Krögers, wrapped in thick fur coats, crept hastily into their majestic equipage, which had been waiting for some time. An unsteady flicker came from the yellow light of the oil lamps burning on poles outside the house—and of those suspended from thick chains across the pavement farther down the street. Here and there the houses, some with bays, some with stoops and benches, protruded into the street as it sloped down toward the Trave. Wet grass sprouted up between the cracked cobblestones. Across the way, St. Mary’s Church lay wrapped in shadows, darkness, and rain.","A high wind was driving the rain slantwise through the streets as the old Kr�gers, wrapped in heavy fur mantles, slipped as fast as they could into their carriage. It had been waiting for hours before the door. The street was lighted by the flickering yellow rays from oil lamps hanging on posts before the houses or suspended on heavy chains across the streets. The projecting fronts of some of the houses jutted out into the roadway; others had porticos or raised benches added on. The street ran steeply down to the River Trave; it was badly paved, and sodden grass sprang up between the cracks. The church of St. Mary'a was entirely shrouded in rain and darkness."
"Ja, das geringe Verständnis, das er unten im Schiff, unter diesen Senatoren, Konsuln und Bürgern und ihren Familien, für seine Leistungen vorhanden wußte, war Herrn Pfühls beständige Kümmernis, und eben darum hatte er gern seinen kleinen Schüler bei sich, den er wenigstens leise darauf aufmerksam machen konnte, daß das, was er soeben gespielt, etwas außerordentlich Schwieriges gewesen sei. Er erging sich in den sonderbarsten technischen Unternehmungen. Er hatte eine »rückgängige Imitation« angefertigt, eine Melodie komponiert, welche vorwärts und rückwärts gelesen gleich war, und hierauf eine ganze »krebsgängig« zu spielende Fuge gegründet. Als er fertig war, legte er mit trübem Gesichtsausdruck die Hände in den Schoß. »Es merkt es niemand«, sagte er mit hoffnungslosem Kopfschütteln. Und dann flüsterte er, während Pastor Pringsheim predigte: »Das war eine krebsgängige Imitation, Johann. Du weißt noch nicht, was das ist … es ist die Nachahmung eines Themas von hinten nach vorn, von der letzten Note zur ersten … etwas ziemlich Schwieriges. Später wirst du erfahren, was die Nachahmung im strengen Satze bedeutet … Mit dem Krebsgang werde ich dich niemals quälen, dich nicht dazu zwingen … Man braucht ihn nicht zu können. Aber glaube nie denen, die dergleichen als Spielerei ohne musikalischen Wert bezeichnen. Du findest den Krebsgang bei den großen Komponisten aller Zeiten. Nur die Lauen und Mittelmäßigen verwerfen solche Übungen aus Hochmut. Demut ziemt sich; das merke dir, Johann.« –","Yes, the little understanding that he knew there was for his achievements down on the ship among those senators, consuls and citizens and their families was Herr Pfühl's constant sorrow, and that's why he liked having his little pupil with him, at least he did could quietly point out that what he had just played was something extraordinarily difficult. He indulged in the strangest technical ventures. He had made a 'backward imitation', composed a melody which read the same forwards and backwards, and based it on a whole fugue to be played 'crably'. When he was done, he put his hands on his lap with a sad expression on his face. ""No one notices,"" he said, shaking his head hopelessly. And then he whispered, while Pastor Pringsheim preached: 'That was a cancer-prone imitation, Johann. You don't know what that is yet...it's mimicking a theme back to front, last note to first...something pretty difficult. Later you will find out what imitation means in a strict sentence... I will never torment you with the crab walk, I will not force you to do it... You don't have to be able to do it. But never believe those who describe such things as gimmicks with no musical value. You find the crab walk in the great composers of all time. Only the lukewarm and mediocre discard such practices out of pride. humility becomes; remember that, Johann.« –","The low level of musical interest that Herr Pfühl knew existed below him in the nave, among the families of senators, consuls, and other solid citizens, was a source of constant sorrow, and that was the real reason he liked to have his young pupil beside him—at least he could call his attention to the extraordinary difficulty of the piece he had just played. He indulged himself in the most remarkable displays of technique. He had composed a “reverse imitation,” a melody that could be read either forward or backward and formed the basis of a fugue that could be played in “crab form.” When he finished, he laid his hands in his lap, a gloomy expression on his face. “Nobody cares,” he said with a hopeless shake of his head. And then, while Pastor Pringsheim preached, he whispered to Hanno, “That was a cancrizans, a crab-form imitation, Johann. You’re not yet familiar with it, but it reproduces every note of a theme from back to front. You’ll learn strict analysis of an imitation in due time. But I’ll never torture you with the crab form, or force you to learn it. But never believe anyone who would tell you that it’s just a game of no musical value whatever. You’ll discover that the crab form has been used by the greatest composers down through the centuries. Only lazy and mediocre composers spurn such exercises—out of arrogance. Whereas humility is in order. Remember that, Johann.” On his eighth birthday, April 15, 1869, Hanno joined his mother to play a duet for the assembled family—a little fantasia of his own, a simple motif, which, when it came to him, had seemed so curious that he developed it further.","Herr Pfiihl, in fact, had a constant grievance in the small understanding there was for his accomplishments down there among the Senators, Consuls, citizens, and thrir families. And thus, he liked to have his small pupil by him, to whom he could point out the extraordinary difficulties of the passages he had just played. ' He performed marvels of technique. He had composed a melody which was just the same read forward or backward, and based upon it a fugue which was to be played ""crab-fashion."" But after performing this wonder: ""Nobody knows the difference,"" he said, and folded his hands in his lap with a dreary look, shaking his head hopelessly. While Pastor Pringsheim was delivering his sermon, he whispered to Hanno: ""That was a crab-fashion imitation, Johann. You don't know what that is yet. It is 113 the imitation of a theme composed backward instead of for-ward--a very, very difficult thing. Later on, I will show you what an imitation in the Strenge Satz involves. As for the 'crab,' I would never ask you to try that. It isn't necessary. But do not believe those who tell you that such things are trifles, without any musiral value. You will find the crab in musicians of all ages. But exercises like that are the scorn of the mediocre and the superficial musician. Humility, Hanno, humility--is the feeling one should have. Don't forget it."""

"Kein Zweifel, Hermann Hagenström hatte Anhänger und Bewunderer. Sein Eifer in öffentlichen Angelegenheiten, die frappierende Schnelligkeit, mit der die Firma Strunck & Hagenström emporgeblüht war und sich entfaltet hatte, des Konsuls luxuriöse Lebensführung, das Haus, das er führte, und die Gänseleberpastete, die er frühstückte, verfehlten nicht, ihren Eindruck zu machen. Dieser große, ein wenig zu fette Mann mit seinem rötlichen, kurzgehaltenen Vollbart und seiner ein wenig zu platt auf der Oberlippe liegenden Nase, dieser Mann, dessen Großvater noch niemand und er selbst nicht gekannt hatte, dessen Vater infolge seiner reichen, aber zweifelhaften Heirat gesellschaftlich noch beinahe unmöglich gewesen war und der dennoch, verschwägert sowohl mit den Huneus als mit den Möllendorpfs, seinen Namen denjenigen der fünf oder sechs herrschenden Familien angereiht und gleichgestellt hatte, war unleugbar eine merkwürdige und respektable Erscheinung in der Stadt. Das Neuartige und damit Reizvolle seiner Persönlichkeit, das, was ihn auszeichnete und ihm in den Augen vieler eine führende Stellung gab, war der liberale und tolerante Grundzug seines Wesens. Die legere und großzügige Art, mit der er Geld verdiente und verausgabte, war etwas anderes als die zähe, geduldige und von streng überlieferten Prinzipien geleitete Arbeit seiner kaufmännischen Mitbürger. Dieser Mann stand frei von den hemmenden Fesseln der Tradition und der Pietät auf seinen eigenen Füßen, und alles Altmodische war ihm fremd. Er bewohnte keines der alten, mit unsinniger Raumverschwendung gebauten Patrizierhäuser, um deren ungeheure Steindielen sich weißlackierte Galerien zogen. Sein Haus in der Sandstraße – der südlichen Verlängerung der Breiten Straße –, mit schlichter Ölfassade, praktisch ausgebeuteten Raumverhältnissen und reicher, eleganter, bequemer Einrichtung, war neu und jedes steifen Stiles bar. Übrigens hatte er in dieses sein Haus noch vor kurzem, gelegentlich einer seiner größeren Abendgesellschaften, eine ans Stadttheater engagierte Sängerin geladen, hatte sie nach Tische vor seinen Gästen, unter denen sich auch sein kunstliebender und schöngeistiger Bruder, der Rechtsgelehrte, befand, singen lassen und die Dame aufs glänzendste honoriert. Er war nicht der Mann, in der Bürgerschaft die Bewilligung größerer Geldsummen zur Restaurierung und Erhaltung der mittelalterlichen Denkmäler zu befürworten. Daß er aber der erste, absolut in der ganzen Stadt der erste gewesen war, der seine Wohnräume und seine Kontors mit Gas beleuchtet hatte, war Tatsache. Gewiß, wenn Konsul Hagenström irgendeiner Tradition lebte, so war es die von seinem Vater, dem alten Hinrich Hagenström, übernommene unbeschränkte, fortgeschrittene, duldsame und vorurteilsfreie Denkungsart, und hierauf gründete sich die Bewunderung, die er genoß.","There is no doubt that Hermann Hagenstrom had followers and admirers. His zeal in public affairs, the striking rapidity with which the firm of Strunck & Hagenstrom had flourished and developed, the Consul's luxurious lifestyle, the house he kept, and the foie gras he ate for breakfast, did not fail to impress do. This tall man, a little too fat, with his reddish, cropped full beard and his nose a little too flat on his upper lip, this man whose grandfather had never known anyone and he himself, whose father socially as a result of his rich but dubious marriage had been almost impossible, and who nevertheless, being related by marriage to both the Huneus and the Möllendorpfs, had ranked his name on an equal footing with those of the five or six ruling families, was undeniably a remarkable and respectable figure in the town. What was new and therefore attractive about his personality, what distinguished him and gave him a leading position in the eyes of many, was the liberal and tolerant character of his nature. The casual and generous way in which he made and spent money was different from the tenacious, patient, and strictly principled work of his fellow merchants. This man stood on his own two feet, free from the shackles of tradition and piety, and alien to all old-fashioned things. He did not live in any of the old patrician houses, built with senseless waste of space, with white-varnished galleries running around their enormous stone floorboards. His house on Sandstrasse—the southern extension of Breite Strasse—with a plain oil façade, practically exploited space and rich, elegant, comfortable furnishings, was new and devoid of any stiff style. Incidentally, he had recently invited a singer who was engaged at the municipal theater to his house, occasionally for one of his larger evening parties, and had her sing to his guests after dinner, among whom was his art-loving and aesthetic brother, the lawyer, and honored the lady most brilliantly. He was not the man to support the approval of larger sums of money for the restoration and preservation of medieval monuments in the citizenship. But it was a fact that he was the first, absolutely the first in the whole city, to light his living quarters and office with gas. Certainly, if Consul Hagenstrom lived any tradition, it was the unrestrained, advanced, tolerant, and unprejudiced way of thinking inherited from his father, old Hinrich Hagenstrom, and on this was based the admiration he enjoyed.","No doubt of it—Hermann Hagenström had his supporters and admirers. His devotion to civic affairs, the stunning speed at which the firm of Strunck & Hagenström had prospered and grown, the luxurious life the consul led, his grand home, and the pâté de foie gras he ate for breakfast—it all could not help making an impression. This large, rather stout man with a reddish, short-cropped beard and somewhat flat nose that hung down over his upper lip; this man who had a grandfather that no one, not even he, had ever met, and a father who had come close to social ostracism because of his marriage to a wealthy but suspect woman; this man whose own marriage had nevertheless connected him with both the Huneuses and the Möllendorpfs, thereby placing his name on the list of five or six ruling families and making himself their equal—this man was undeniably an intriguing and respected figure in town. But the real novelty, the distinctive trait that made him so attractive and conspicuous a personage and singled him out for a leading position in the eyes of many people, was his liberal and tolerant nature. The easy, flamboyant way he earned and spent his money was very different from the dogged, patient labor based on strict traditional principles that characterized his fellow merchants. This man stood on his own feet, unencumbered by the chains of custom and reverence for the past—he was a stranger to anything old-fashioned. He did not live in one of the old patrician mansions that wasted absurd amounts of space with white enameled galleries above immense paved entrance halls. His new house on Sand Strasse—the southern extension of Breite Strasse—was free of old architectural strictures; it had a simple painted façade and cleverly utilized its space; the furnishings were luxurious, elegant, and comfortable. And then, just recently, he had thrown one of his grand evening parties and had invited a soprano from the municipal theater to sing after dinner for his guests—among them, his lawyer brother, so renowned for his wit and love of the arts; it was said he had paid the lady handsomely. He was not a man who would rise in the town council to endorse the appropriation of large sums for restoring and preserving the town’s medieval monuments. But it was a fact that he had been the first, absolutely the first, in town to illuminate his residence and office with gas. No doubt of it—if any tradition governed Consul Hagenström’s life, it was the totally open, progressive, tolerant, and unbiased outlook he had inherited from his father, old Hinrich Hagenström—and this formed the basis of the general admiration he enjoyed.","Hermann Hagenstrom had his admirers and hangers-on-- there was no doubt of that. His zeal in public affairs, the spectacular rise of the firm of Strunck and Hagenstrom, the showy house the Consul kept, the luxurious life he led, the pates-de-f oie-gras he ate for breakfast--all these could not fail to make an impression. This large, rather over-stout man with the short, full, reddish beard and the snub nose coming dawn flat on his upper lip, this man whose grandfather nobody knew, not even himself, and whose father had made himself socially impossible by a rich but doubtful marriage; this man had become a brother-in-law of the Huneus' and the Mbllen- dorpfs, had ranged his name alongside those of the five or six reigning families in the town, and was undeniably a remark- able and a respected figure. The novel and therewith the at- tractive element in his personality--that which singled him out for a leading position in the eyes of many--was its liberal and tolerant strain. His light, large way of making money and spending it again differed fundamentally from the patient, persistent toil and the inherited principles of his fellow mer- chants. This man stood on his own feet, free from the fetters of tradition and ancestral piety; and all the old ways were for- eign to him. His house was not one of the ancient patrician mansions, built with senseless waste of space, in tall white gal- leries mounting above a stone-paved ground floor. His home on Sand Street, the southern extension of Broad Street, was a modern dwelling, not conforming to any set style of archi- tecture, with a simple painted facade, but furnished inside with every luxury and planned with the cleverest economy of space. Recently, on the occasion of one of his large evening parties, he had invited a prirna donna from the government theatre, to sing after dinner to his guests--among them hih witty, art-loving brother--and had paid her an enormous fee for her services. Hermann Hagenstrbm was not the man to vote in the Assembly for the application of large sums of money to preserve and restore the town's mediaeval monuments. But it was a fact that he was the first, absolutely the first man in town to light his house and his offices with gas. Yes, if Consul Hagenstrom could be said to represent any tradition whatever, it was the free, progressive, tolerant, unpreju-diced habit of thought which he had inherited from his father, old Hinrich--and on this was based all the admiration people undoubtedly felt for him."

Her heart was beating, truly, the heart of this old woman, hardened by life, was beating faster!","Her heart was filled with joy at all the fine new pieces of furniture that had come her way, and although no one even gave a thought to chasing her out of her parents’ home so soon, she eagerly went about finding and renting a new apartment for herself and her family. True, it would be hard to say goodbye—and the thought could bring tears to her eyes. But, on the other hand, the prospect of change and renewal had its charms. Would it not be almost like starting over again, for the fourth time? And so she inspected apartments, consulted with Jakobs the upholsterer, negotiated with shopkeepers about portieres and carpet runners. Her heart pounded faster—no doubt of it, the heart of this old woman steeled by life beat higher.","She rejoiced from the bottom of her heart over all the good furniture that had fallen to her share. And though there was no idea of bustling her away from under the parental roof, she plunged at once, with the greatest zest, into the business of finding and renting a new home. The leave-taking would be hard--the very thought of it brought tears to her eyes, But the prospect of a change was not without its own charm too. It was almost like another setting-out--the fourth one! And so again she looked at houses and visited Jacob's; again she bargained for portieres and stair-carpets. And while she did all that, her heart beat faster-- yes, even the hrart of this old woman who was steeled by the misfortunes of life!"

"Dennoch war es, besonders seit sie selbst, wie sie sagte, »abgewirtschaftet« hatte, Frau Antonies heißester Wunsch, daß ihre Tochter die Hoffnungen erfüllen möge, die ihr, der Mutter, fehlgeschlagen, und eine Heirat machen, welche, vorteilhaft und glücklich, der Familie zur Ehre gereichen, und die Schicksale der Mutter vergessen lassen würde. In erster Linie ihrem älteren Bruder gegenüber, der in letzter Zeit so geringe Hoffnungsfreudigkeit an den Tag legte, sehnte Tony sich nach einem Beweise, daß das Glück der Familie noch nicht erschöpft, daß sie keineswegs schon am Ende angelangt sei … Ihre zweite Mitgift, die 17000 Taler, die Herr Permaneder mit so viel Kulanz wieder herausgegeben hatte, lagen für Erika bereit, und kaum hatte Frau Antonie, scharfäugig und erfahren, die zarte Verbindung bemerkt, die sich zwischen ihrer Tochter und dem Direktor angesponnen hatte, als sie schon den Himmel mit Gebeten anzugehen begann, Herr Weinschenk möge Visite machen.","Nevertheless, especially since she herself had, as she said, ""sunken down,"" Mrs. Antonie's fervent wish was that her daughter should fulfill the hopes that her mother had failed in, and make a marriage which, advantageously and happily, would be an honor for the family and would make one forget the mother's fate. Above all towards her older brother, who had been showing so little hope lately, Tony longed for some proof that the family's fortunes were not yet exhausted, that they were by no means at the end... Her second dowry, the 17,000 thalers, which Mr. Permaneder had given back with such goodwill, were ready for Erika, and Mrs. Antonie, sharp-eyed and experienced, had scarcely noticed the tender bond that had developed between her daughter and the director when she was already in heaven began to approach with prayers that Mr. Weinschenk might make visits.","It was nevertheless Frau Antonie’s most fervent wish—particularly since she had “gone out of business” herself, as she put it—that her daughter would fulfill the hopes that had gone so awry for her, that she would marry happily and advantageously, bringing honor to the family and erasing the memory of her mother’s fate. Particularly for the sake of her older brother, who had displayed so little optimism of late, Tony longed for some proof that the family’s luck had not run out, that they were not finished and done with. Her second dowry, the seventeen thousand thalers that Herr Permaneder had so generously returned, lay ready for Erika; and the moment Frau Antonie’s sharp, experienced eye noted the first tender bonds forming between her daughter and the director , she began to importune heaven with prayers that Herr Weinschenk would pay a visit.","Yet it was Frau Antonie's most ardent hope, especially after she herself had ""failed in business,"" as she said, that her daughter might realize her own unfulfilled dream of a happy and advantageous marriage, which should redound to the glory of the family and sink the mother's failure in final oblivion. Tony longed for this beyond everything, and chiefly now for her brother's sake, who had latterly shown so little optimism, as a sign to him that the luck of the family was not yet lost, that they were by no means ""at the end of their rope. "" Her second dowry, the eighteen thousand thaler so magnanimously returned by Herr Permaneder, lay waiting for Erica; and directly Frau Antonie's practiced glanre marked the budding tenderness between her daughter and the Director, she began to trouble Heaven with a prayer that Herr Weinschenk might be led to visit them."

When he came to speak of the Jerusalem Evenings, the old women who had been friends of the deceased began to sob—except for Madame Kethelsen, who could hear nothing and stared straight ahead with the secretive look of the deaf, and the Gerhardt twins, the descendants of Paul Gerhardt, who stood holding hands in one corner; their eyes were clear and dry, for they were happy for their dead friend and would have envied her, if envy and jealousy had not been totally foreign to their nature.","Pastor Pringsheim's sermon went on, turning the knife in the wound that death had made: he caused each person pres-193 ent to remember his own dead, he knew how to make tears flow where none would have flowed of themselves--and for this the weeping ones were grateful to him. When he mentioned the Jerusalem evenings, all the old friends of the dead began to sob--excepting Madame Kethelsen, who did not hear a word he said, but stared straight before her with the remote air of the deaf, and the Gerhardt sisters, the descendants of Paul, who stood hand in hand in a corner, their eyes glowing.

"In diesem Jahre unternahmen Buddenbrooks auch während der Schulferien Christians und Klaras keine Erholungsreise. Der Konsul erklärte, geschäftlich zu sehr in Anspruch genommen zu sein, und die schwebende Frage in betreff Antoniens trug dazu bei, daß man abwartend in der Mengstraße verblieb. An Herrn Grünlich war, von der Hand des Konsuls geschrieben, ein überaus diplomatischer Brief abgegangen; aber der Fortgang der Dinge ward durch Tonys in den kindischsten Formen geäußerte Hartnäckigkeit behindert. »Bewahre, Mama!« sagte sie. »Ich kann ihn nicht ausstehen!« wobei sie die zweite Silbe des letzten Wortes mit höchstem Nachdruck betonte und das »st« ausnahmsweise nicht getrennt sprach. Oder sie erklärte mit Feierlichkeit: »Vater!« – sonst pflegte Tony »Papa« zu sagen – »Ich werde ihm mein Jawort niemals erteilen.«","In that year, the Buddenbrooks did not undertake any vacation trips, even during Christian's and Klara's school holidays. The Consul declared that he was too busy on business, and the pending question concerning Antonia contributed to the waiting in the Mengstrasse. A very diplomatic letter, written by the consul, had been sent to Herr Grünlich; but the progress of things was hampered by Tony's obstinacy, expressed in the most childish forms. ""Forbear, Mama!"" she said. 'I can't stand him!', emphasizing the second syllable of the last word with great emphasis and, for once, not splitting the 'st'. Or she would declare with solemnity, ""Father!"" - Tony used to say ""Papa"" - ""I'll never say yes to him.""","THAT YEAR the Buddenbrooks took no holiday trip during Christian and Clara’s school vacation. The consul explained that he was much too busy—but the unresolved issue of Antonie was likewise a reason for them to wait out the summer on Meng Strasse. The consul had sent a diplomatic letter to Herr Grünlich; but progress in the matter was hindered by Tony’s stubbornness, which took the most childish forms. “Heaven forbid, Mama!” she would say, “I can’t stand him”—with as much stress as possible on the penultimate word. Or she would declare solemnly: “Father”—usually Tony called him “Papa”—“I will never consent to his proposal.”","THIS year the Buddenbrooks took no holiday during Chris-tian's and Clara's vacation. The Consul said he was too busy; but it was Tony's unsettled affair as well, that kept them lin-gering in Mengstrasse. A very diplomatic letter, written by the Consul himself, had been dispatched to Herr Gr�nlich; but the progress of the wooing was hindered by Tony's ob-stinacy. She expressed herself in the most childish way. "" Heaven forbid, Mamma,"" she would say. ""I simply can't zndure him!"" with tremendous emphasis on the second syl-lable. Dr she would explain solemnly, ""Father"" (Tony never otherwise said anything but ""Papa""), ""I can never yield him my consent."""

If I have inwardly shrunk away from you, it was because I had to protect myself from you, because your nature and character are a danger to me.

"Frau Antonie hatte bei Tische über Hugo Weinschenk gesprochen, dessen Gemütszustand äußerst traurig sein sollte, und dann war die Frage erörtert worden, wann man wohl, mit einiger Aussicht auf Erfolg, dem Senate ein Gnadengesuch werde einreichen können. Nun hatten sich die drei Verwandten im Wohnzimmer um den runden Mitteltisch unter der großen Gaslampe niedergelassen. Gerda Buddenbrook und ihre Schwägerin saßen, mit Handarbeiten beschäftigt, einander gegenüber. Die Senatorin hielt ihr schönes weißes Gesicht über eine Seidenstickerei gebeugt, daß ihr schweres Haar, vom Lichte beschienen, dunkel zu erglühen schien, und Frau Permaneder, den Klemmer gänzlich schief und zweckwidrig auf der Nase, befestigte mit sorglichen Fingern eine große, wunderbar rote Atlasschleife an einem winzigen gelben Körbchen. Das wurde ein Geburtstagsgeschenk für irgendeine Bekannte. Der Senator aber saß seitwärts vom Tische in einem breiten Polsterfauteuil mit schräger Rückenlehne und las mit gekreuzten Beinen die Zeitung, während er dann und wann den Rauch seiner russischen Zigarette einzog und ihn als einen hellgrauen Strom durch den Schnurrbart wieder ausatmete …","Frau Antonie had spoken at table about Hugo Weinschenk, whose state of mind was said to be extremely sad, and then the question had been discussed as to when, with some chance of success, a petition for clemency could be submitted to the senate.

Gerda Buddenbrook and her sister-in-law sat opposite each other, busy with needlework. The senator kept her beautiful white face bent over a piece of silk embroidery so that her heavy hair seemed to glow darkly in the light, and Frau Permaneder, her clipper completely crooked and inappropriate on her nose, fastened a large, wonderfully red satin bow with careful fingers on a tiny yellow basket. This became a birthday present for someone I knew.

It was to be a birthday present for a friend.

The Frau Senator bent her lovely face over some embroidery, and the gas-light lit up gleams in her dark hair; Frau Permaneder, with careful fingers, fastened an enormous red satin bow on to a tiny yellow basket, intended as a birthday present for a friend.

"Bevor man zu Butter und Käse überging, ergriff die Konsulin noch einmal das Wort zu einer kleinen Ansprache an die Ihrigen. Wenn auch nicht alles, sagte sie, im Laufe der Jahre sich so gestaltet habe, wie man es kurzsichtig und unweise erwünscht habe, so bleibe doch immer noch übergenug des sichtbarlichen Segens übrig, um die Herzen mit Dank zu erfüllen. Gerade der Wechsel von Glück und strenger Heimsuchung zeige, daß Gott seine Hand niemals von der Familie gezogen, sondern daß er ihre Geschicke nach tiefen und weisen Absichten gelenkt habe und lenke, die ungeduldig ergründen zu wollen man sich nicht erkühnen dürfe. Und nun wolle man, mit hoffenden Herzen, einträchtig anstoßen auf das Wohl der Familie, auf ihre Zukunft, jene Zukunft, die da sein werde, wenn die Alten und Älteren unter den Anwesenden längst in kühler Erde ruhen würden … auf die Kinder, denen das heutige Fest ja recht eigentlich gehöre …","Before moving on to butter and cheese, the Consul once again spoke for a short speech to her family. If not everything, she said, has turned out as the years have shortsightedly and unwisely wished for, there still remains plenty of visible blessings to fill hearts with gratitude. The very alternation of happiness and severe affliction shows that God has never withdrawn his hand from the family, but that he has guided and is directing their destiny according to deep and wise intentions, which one should not dare to fathom impatiently. And now, with hearts of hope, let us toast the well-being of the family, its future, the future that will be there when the old and the elderly among those present have long been resting in the cool earth... to the children who today's festival really belongs ...","Before the last course of butter and cheese was served, old Madame Buddenbrook used the opportunity for another little speech. Even though not everything had turned out over the years quite the way one, out of shortsightedness, might have wished, she said, nevertheless there still remained such manifold and obvious blessings that their hearts should be filled with gratitude. Indeed, the interplay of moments of happiness and affliction only proved that God had never lifted His hand from the family, but that He had guided, and would continue to guide, its fortunes according to His deep and wise plan, which one ought never make bold to fathom out of impatience. And now, with hopeful hearts, they ought to raise a toast in harmony to the family’s health and to its future, to a future that would still continue long after its oldest members present this evening had gone to their rest in the coolness of the grave.—And so, then, a toast to the children, to whom this holiday truly belonged.","Before they arrived at the butter and cheese, the Frau Consul found occasion for another little speech to hrr family. If, she said, not quite everything in the course of the years had gone as we, in our short-sightedness, desired, there remained such manifold blessings as should fill our hearts with gratitude and love. For it was precisely this mingling of trials with blessings which showed that Cod never lifted his hand from the family, but ever guided its destinies according to His wise design, which we mi^ht not seek ID question. And now, with hopeful hearts, we might rlrink together to the family health and to its future--that future when all the old and elderly of the present company would be laid to rest; and to the children, to whom the Christmas feast most properly belonged."

"»Monsieur Gotthold – voilà!« Der Alte tat, als bliebe er ganz ruhig angesichts des bläulichen, versiegelte Papieres, das er entgegennahm. »Herrn Johann Buddenbrook sen. Persönlich … Ein Mann von conduite, dein Herr Stiefbruder, Jean! Habe ich seinen zweiten Brief neulich überhaupt beantwortet? Allein er schreibt einen dritten …« Während sein rosiges Gesicht sich mehr und mehr verdüsterte, zerriß er mit einem Finger das Siegel, entfaltete rasch das dünne Papier, wandte sich schräge, daß die Schrift vom Kandelaber aus beleuchtet ward und führte einen energischen Schlag mit dem Handrücken darauf. Selbst in dieser Handschrift schien Abtrünnigkeit und Rebellion zu liegen, denn während die Zeilen der Buddenbrooks sonst winzig, leicht und schräge über das Papier eilten, waren diese Buchstaben hoch, steil und mit plötzlichem Drucke versehen; viele Wörter waren mit einem raschen, gebogenen Federzug unterstrichen.","“Monsieur Gotthold – voilà!” The old man pretended not to worry about the bluish, sealed paper he accepted. »Herr Johann Buddenbrook sen. Personally... A man by conduite, your Mr stepbrother, Jean! Did I even answer his second letter the other day? But he writes a third…” While his rosy face grew more and more somber, he tore the seal with one finger, quickly unfolded the thin paper, turned at an angle so that the writing was illuminated from the candelabra, and struck a vigorous blow with the back of hand on it. Even in that handwriting there seemed to be apostasy and rebellion, for while the Buddenbrooks' lines otherwise rushed tiny, light, and slanting across the paper, these letters were tall, steep, and punctuated with sudden pressure; many words were underlined with a swift, curved pen.","“Monsieur Gotthold—voilà!” The old man pretended to remain quite calm as he accepted the bluish paper, still sealed. “Herr Johann Buddenbrook, Sr. Personal. Your good stepbrother is a man of conduite, Jean. Did I ever answer that second letter of his that came the other day? And here he’s written a third.” While his pink face grew more and more somber, he ripped open the seal with one finger, quickly unfolded the thin paper, and leaned over to catch the candlelight, giving the letter a sharp rap with the back of his hand. There seemed to be disloyalty and rebellion even in the handwriting—for whereas the hand of the Buddenbrooks usually hurried lightly across paper in tiny, slanted lines, this large and wildly tilted script had been pressed on the page with eruptive energy. Many words had been underlined with a rapid flourish of the pen.","""Monsieur Gotthold, voila!"" The old man affected to be quite unmoved as he took the sealed blue paper. "" Herr Jo-hann Buddenbrook, Senior. Personal. A careful man, your step-brother, Jean! Have I answered his second letter, that came the other day? And so now he writes me a third. "" The old man's rosy face grew sterner as he opened the seal with one finger, unfolded the thin paper, and gave it a smart rap with the back of his hand as he turned about to catch the light from the candles. The very handwriting of this letter seemed to express revolt and disloyalty. All the Bud-denbrooks wrote a fine, flowing hand; but these tall straight letters were full of heavy strokes, and many of the words were hastily underlined."

"Erika durfte sich neben die Großmutter setzen, und Ida nahm, ohne die Rückenlehne zu benützen, auf einem Sessel Platz und begann zu häkeln. So saßen alle eine Weile schweigend und warteten auf den Konsul. Die Luft war dumpf. Draußen war das letzte Stück Blau verschwunden, und tief, schwer und trächtig hing der dunkelgraue Himmel hernieder. Die Farben des Zimmers, die Tinten der Landschaften auf den Tapeten, das Gelb der Möbel und der Vorhänge, waren erloschen, die Nuancen in Tonys Kleide spielten nicht mehr, und die Augen der Menschen waren ohne Glanz.

And the wind, the westerly wind, which had just been playing in the trees on the Marienkirchhof and had driven the dust around in little eddies on the dark street, no longer stirred. It was completely silent for a moment.","Erika was permitted to sit next to her grandmother, and Ida took a seat on an armchair, without touching her back to it, and began to crochet.

"Sie war höchst niedlich, die kleine Tony Buddenbrook. Unter dem Strohhut quoll ihr starkes Haar, dessen Blond mit den Jahren dunkler wurde, natürlich gelockt hervor, und die ein wenig hervorstehende Oberlippe gab dem frischen Gesichtchen mit den graublauen, munteren Augen einen Ausdruck von Keckheit, der sich auch in ihrer graziösen kleinen Gestalt wiederfand; sie setzte ihre schmalen Beinchen in den schneeweißen Strümpfen mit einer wiegenden und elastischen Zuversichtlichkeit. Viele Leute kannten und begrüßten die kleine Tochter des Konsuls Buddenbrook, wenn sie durch die Gartenpforte in die Kastanienallee hinaustrat.

Under the straw hat her thick hair, the blond of which had darkened over the years, naturally curled out, and the slightly protruding upper lip gave the fresh little face with the grey-blue, lively eyes an expression of boldness, which was also reflected in her graceful little figure ; she sat down her narrow little legs in the snow-white stockings with rocking and elastic confidence. Many people knew and greeted the Consul Buddenbrook's little daughter when she stepped through the garden gate into Kastanienallee. A vegetable woman, perhaps, who, with her big straw boat with light green ribbons on her head, drove in from the village in her cart, called out a friendly ""God'n Morgen ook, Mamselling!"" passed by with bloomers, white stockings and buckled shoes, even took off his rough top hat in deference ...","She was really very pretty, little Tony Buddenbrook was. Flowing from beneath her straw hat was a thick head of blond hair, curly of course, and turning darker with each passing year; and the slightly protruding upper lip gave a saucy look to her fresh little face with its lively gray-blue eyes, a sauciness repeated in her small, graceful body. There was self-assurance in the spring of her thin legs in their snow-white stockings. A great many people knew her, and they would greet Consul Buddenbrook’s little daughter as she stepped through the garden gate onto the chestnut-lined lane.

Un-der her straw hat curled a wealth of blonde hair, slowly dark-ening with the years.

People knew and greeted the young daughter of Consul Buddenbrook as she came out of the garden gate and up the chestnut-bordered avenue. Perhaps an old market-woman, driving her little cart in from the village, would nod her head in its big flat straw hat with its light green ribbons, and call out ""Mornin', little missy!""

And then, suddenly, with a jerk, with a nervous and eager expression on her face—she swallowed, and her lips moved very quickly together for a moment—she seized the pen, not dipping it, but thrusting it into the inkwell and writing with a crooked one Index finger and her passionate head leaning low on her shoulder, in her awkward handwriting, flying diagonally from left to right: »... Became engaged on September 22, 1845 to Mr. Bendix Grünlich, merchant in Hamburg.«","Tony gazed for a long time at her own name and the open space after it. And then, suddenly, she flinched and swallowed hard, her whole face a play of nervous, eager movement, her lips quickly touching for just a moment—and now she grabbed the pen, plunged rather than dipped it into the inkwell, and, crooking her index finger and laying her flushed head on her shoulder, wrote in her own clumsy hand, slanting upward from left to right: “ Engaged on 22 September 1845 to Herr Bendix Grünlich, merchant from Hamburg.”","Tony looked a long time at her name and at the blank 159 space next it. Then, suddenly, with a jerk, with a nervous, feverish accompaniment of sobbing breaths and quick-moving lips--she clutched the pen, plunged it rather than dipped it into the ink, and wrote, with her forefinger crooked, her hot head bent far over on her shoulder, in her awkward hand-writing that climbed up the page from left to right: ""Be-trothed, on Sept .22, 1845, to Herr Bendix Gr�nlich, Merchant, of Hamburg."""
"»Sie erlauben nun, daß ich mir einen genaueren Einblick in die Lage der Dinge verschaffe«, sagte der Konsul und griff nach dem Hauptbuch. Plötzlich jedoch streckte Herr Grünlich schirmend beide Hände über den Tisch hin, lange, von hohen blauen Adern durchzogene Hände, die ersichtlich zitterten, und rief mit bewegter Stimme: »Einen Augenblick! Noch einen Augenblick, Vater! Oh, lassen Sie mich noch eine einleitende Bemerkung vorausschicken!… Ja, Sie werden Einblick gewinnen, Ihrem Blick wird nichts entgehen … Aber glauben Sie mir: Sie werden Einblick in die Lage eines Unglücklichen gewinnen, nicht eines Schuldigen!

In diesem Sinne …«","""Now you will allow me to take a closer look at the state of affairs,"" said the Consul, picking up the ledger. Suddenly, however, Herr Grünlich stretched out both hands across the table to shield himself, long hands with high blue veins that were obviously trembling, and called out in an agitated voice: “Just a moment! Just a moment, father! Oh, let me make one more opening remark!... Yes, you will gain insight, nothing will escape your gaze... But believe me: you will gain insight into the plight of an unfortunate, not a guilty one! See in me a man, father, who tirelessly resisted fate, but who was knocked to the ground by it! In this sense …""","“You will permit me, won’t you, to take a closer look at the state of your affairs?” the consul said, reaching for the ledger. But suddenly Herr Grünlich reached across the table, protecting the ledger with both hands—threaded with strong blue veins and visibly trembling—and cried in an agitated voice, “One moment, one moment, please, Father. Do let me make a few introductory remarks. Yes, you shall have your look at the state of my affairs, nothing can escape your eyes. But believe me when I say it will be a look into the affairs of an unfortunate, not a guilty, man. You see in me a man, Father, who has struggled tirelessly against fate, but who has at last been struck down. And with that in mind …”","""May I look into matters a little more closely?"" asked the Consul, taking up the ledger. But Herr Gr�nlich suddenly stretched out his hands over the table--long, trembling hands marked with high blue veins--and cried out in a voice that trembled too: "" A moment, Father. Just a moment. Let me make just a few explanations. Yes, you will get an insight into everything--nothing will escape your glance; but, believe me, you will get an insight into the situation of an unfortu-nate, not a guilty man.

"O ja, das war die Frage; das war von jeher, so lange er denken konnte, seine Frage gewesen! Das Leben war hart, und das Geschäftsleben war in seinem rücksichtslosen und unsentimentalen Verlaufe ein Abbild des großen und ganzen Lebens.

Life was hard, and business, as it took its ruthless, unsentimental course, was the epitome of life in general. Did Thomas Buddenbrook stand with both feet firmly planted in that hard, practical life—as had his father before him? He had often enough had reason to doubt it. From adolescence on, he had often enough had to revise his own feelings when confronted by that life—dealing hard blows, taking hard blows, yet never feeling them to be hard, but perfectly natural. Would he never completely learn that lesson?","Yes, that was the question. It had always been, as far back as he could remember, the question. Life was harsh: and business, with its ruthless unsentimenlalily. was an epitome of life.

Often enough, from his youth onwards, he had sternly brought his feelings into line. To inflict punishment, to take punishment, and not to think of it as punishment, but as something to be taken for granted--should he never completely learn that lesson?"

"Im Laufe der Jahre hatte seine Pedanterie zugenommen und war zur vollständigen Wunderlichkeit geworden. Er brauchte eine Viertelstunde, um sich, unter Schnurrbartstreichen, Räuspern und bedächtigen Seitenblicken, eine Zigarre anzuschneiden und die Spitze in seinen Geldbeutel zu versenken. Des Abends, wenn die Gaslampen jeden Winkel des Kontors taghell erleuchteten, unterließ er es niemals, noch eine brennende Stearinkerze auf sein Pult zu stellen. Nach jeder halben Stunde erhob er sich, um sich zur Wasserleitung zu begeben und seinen Kopf zu begießen. Eines Vormittags lag unordentlicherweise ein leerer Getreidesack unter seinem Pult, den er für eine Katze hielt und zum Gaudium des gesamten Personals unter lauten Verwünschungen zu verjagen suchte … Nein, er war nicht der Mann, der jetzigen Mattigkeit seines Kompagnons zum Trotz, fördernd in die Geschäfte einzugreifen, und oft erfaßte den Senator, wie jetzt, während er matten Blickes in die Finsternis des Salons hinüberstarrte, die Scham und eine verzweifelte Ungeduld, wenn er sich den unbeträchtlichen Kleinbetrieb, das pfennigweise Geschäftemachen vergegenwärtigte, zu dem sich in letzter Zeit die Firma Johann Buddenbrook erniedrigt hatte.","Over the years his pedantry had increased to complete whimsicality. It took him a quarter of an hour, while stroking his mustache, clearing his throat and looking sideways, to cut a cigar and sink the end into his wallet.

After every half hour he got up to go to the water pipe and water his head. One morning there was an empty sack of grain lying untidy under his desk, which he mistook for a cat and, to the amusement of the entire staff, tried to chase away with loud curses... No, he was not the man, despite his partner's current weariness, to help out in the shops to intervene, and often, as now, while he stared wearily into the darkness of the salon, the senator was seized with shame and a desperate impatience when he thought of the insignificant small business, the penny-wise business that the Johann firm had recently developed into Buddenbrook had humiliated.","Over the years he had become increasingly pedantic, until now he was a perfect eccentric.

"Es kam die Geographiestunde und mit ihr das Extemporale, ein sehr wichtiges Extemporale über das Gebiet von Hessen-Nassau. Ein Mann mit rotem Bart und braunem Schoßrock trat ein. Sein Gesicht war bleich, und auf seinen Händen, deren Poren weit offen standen, wuchs nicht ein einziges Härchen. Dies war der geistreiche Oberlehrer, Herr Doktor Mühsam. Er litt zuweilen an Lungenblutungen und sprach beständig in ironischem Tone, weil er sich für ebenso witzig wie leidend hielt. Zu Hause besaß er eine Art Heine-Archiv, eine Sammlung von Papieren und Gegenständen, die sich auf den frechen und kranken Poeten bezogen. Jetzt fixierte er die Grenzen von Hessen-Nassau auf der Wandtafel und bat dann mit einem zugleich melancholischen und höhnischen Lächeln, die Herren möchten in ihre Hefte zeichnen, was das Land an Merkwürdigem biete. Er schien sowohl die Schüler wie das Land Hessen-Nassau verspotten zu wollen; und doch war es ein sehr wichtiges Extemporale, vor dem alle sich fürchteten.","The geography lesson came and with it the extemporal, a very important extemporal about the Hesse-Nassau area.

He suffered at times from hemorrhages from the lungs, and constantly spoke ironically, thinking himself as witty as he was ailing. At home he had a sort of Heine archive, a collection of papers and objects related to the impudent and ailing poet. Now he fixed the borders of Hesse-Nassau on the blackboard and then, with a smile that was both melancholy and scornful, asked the gentlemen to draw in their notebooks what strange things the country had to offer. He seemed to want to mock both the students and the state of Hesse-Nassau; and yet it was a very important extemporal that everyone dreaded.","And now came geography and a test, a very important test about the province of Hesse-Nassau.

He suffered from occasional hemorrhaging of the lungs and always spoke in an ironic tone of voice, because he considered himself as clever as he was sickly. He had set up a kind of Heinrich Heine museum at home, a collection of papers and memorabilia, all of it related in some way to that brash and frail poet.

"Es war warm und still. Die Düfte der reinlich abgezirkelten Beete lagen in der Abendluft, und der von hohen lilafarbenen Iris umstandene Springbrunnen sandte seinen Strahl mit friedlichem Plätschern dem dunklen Himmel entgegen, an dem die ersten Sterne zu erglimmen begannen. Im Hintergrunde führte eine kleine, von zwei niedrigen Obelisken flankierte Freitreppe zu einem erhöhten Kiesplatze empor, auf welchem ein offener, hölzerner Pavillon stand, der mit seiner herabgelassenen Markise einige Gartenstühle beschirmte. Zur Linken ward das Grundstück durch eine Mauer vom Nachbargarten abgegrenzt; rechts aber war die Seitenwand des Nebenhauses in ihrer ganzen Höhe mit einem hölzernen Gerüst verkleidet, das bestimmt war, mit der Zeit von Schlinggewächsen bedeckt zu werden. Es gab zu den Seiten der Freitreppe und des Pavillonplatzes ein paar Johannis- und Stachelbeersträucher; aber nur ein großer Baum war da, ein knorriger Walnußbaum, der links an der Mauer stand.","It was warm and still.

On the left the property was separated from the neighboring garden by a wall; on the right, however, the side wall of the adjoining house was clad over its entire height with a wooden scaffolding, which was destined to be covered with creepers over time.

"Die Zeiger wiesen auf zehn Minuten nach sechs Uhr … Ach, es war sinnlos, nun aufzustehen und zu arbeiten, es war zuviel, es gab beinahe für jede Stunde etwas zu lernen, es lohnte nicht, damit anzufangen, und der Zeitpunkt, den er sich festgesetzt, war sowieso überschritten … War es denn so sicher, wie es ihm gestern erschienen war, daß er heute sowohl im Lateinischen wie in der Chemie an die Reihe kommen würde? Es war anzunehmen, ja, nach menschlicher Voraussicht war es wahrscheinlich.

"Ein Anfall von Freude machte, daß er aus dem Bette sprang und auf nackten Füßen zum Fenster lief. Er zog das Rouleau empor, öffnete den einen Flügel, indem er den weißlackierten Haken löste, und blickte der Fliege nach, die über die Kieswege und Rosenbeete des Kurgartens hin davonflog. Der Musiktempel, im Halbkreise von Buchsbaum umwachsen, stand noch leer und still den Hotelgebäuden gegenüber. Das »Leuchtenfeld«, das seinen Namen nach dem Leuchtturm trug, der irgendwo zur Rechten aufragte, dehnte sich unter dem weißlich bezogenen Himmel aus, bis sein kurzes, von kahlen Erdflecken unterbrochenes Gras in hohe und harte Strandgewächse und dann in Sand überging, dort, wo man die Reihen der kleinen hölzernen Privatpavillons und der Sitzkörbe unterschied, die auf die See hinausblickten. Sie lag da, die See, in Frieden und Morgenlicht, in flaschengrünen und blauen, glatten und gekrausten Streifen, und ein Dampfer kam zwischen den rotgemalten Tonnen, die ihm das Fahrwasser bezeichneten, von Kopenhagen daher, ohne daß man zu wissen brauchte, ob er »Najaden« oder »Friederike Oeverdieck« hieß. Und Hanno Buddenbrook zog wieder tief und mit stiller Seligkeit den würzigen Atem ein, den die See zu ihm herübersandte, und grüßte sie zärtlich mit den Augen, mit einem stummen, dankbaren und liebevollen Gruße.","A fit of joy made him jump out of bed and run barefoot to the window. He pulled up the blind, opened one wing by releasing the white-lacquered hook, and watched the fly fly away over the gravel paths and rose beds of the spa gardens. The music temple, surrounded by boxwood in a semicircle, stood empty and silent opposite the hotel buildings. The ""Field of Lights,"" so named after the lighthouse that loomed somewhere to the right, stretched out under the whitish-tinged sky until its short grass, broken by patches of bare earth, gave way to tall and hard beach-growth and then to sand, there, where one could distinguish the rows of small wooden private pavilions and basket chairs that looked out to sea. It lay there, the sea, in peace and morning light, in bottle green and blue, smooth and ruffled stripes, and a steamer came along from Copenhagen between the red-painted buoys that marked the fairway, without one needing to know whether it was ""Najaden"" or ""Friederike Oeverdieck"" was called. And Hanno Buddenbrook again drew in deeply and with quiet bliss the fragrant breath that the sea sent across to him and greeted her tenderly with his eyes, with a silent, grateful and loving greeting.","In a burst of joy he sprang from his bed and ran to the window in his bare feet. He pulled up the blind, loosened the white-enameled hook, and opened the casement, watching the fly as it sped off across the gravel paths and rose beds of the garden. Facing the hotel buildings and set within a semicircle of boxwoods, the band shell stood quiet and empty. The Leuchtenfeld flats, which got their name from the lighthouse that rose up somewhere off to the right, stretched out far before him under the bright white sky, until the short grass, interspersed with patches of bare earth, gave way to taller shore vegetation and then to the sandy beach, where he could make out rows of little private wooden pavilions and wicker beach chairs facing the open sea. There it lay in the peaceful morning light, the sea—smooth and ruffled streaks of bottle-green and blue—and a steamer moved between rows of red barrels that marked the channel. It was on its way home from Copenhagen, and you didn’t need to know whether it was the Naiad or the Friederike Oeverdieck. And in that moment of quiet bliss, Hanno Buddenbrook took another deep breath of the spicy air sent by the sea, and he greeted the sea tenderly with his eyes—a silent, grateful greeting full of love.","An access of joy made him spring up and run barefoot to the window. He put up the blind and unfastened the white-painted hook of the window; and as he opened it the fly escaped and flew away over the flower-beds and the gravelled paths.

The Leuchenfield, which took its name from the lighthouse that stood on it, somewhere off to the right, stretched its extent of short sparse grass under the pale sky, to a point where the grass passed into a growth of tall, coarse water- plants; and then came the sand, with its rows of little wooden huts and tall wicker beach-chairs looking out to the sea.

"Und kaum war er hiermit fertig, als er zu Berichten aus dem Zirkus Renz überging und die ganze Entree eines englischen Sprechclowns in einer Art wiederzugeben begann, daß man sich einbilden konnte, vor der Manege zu sitzen. Man vernahm das übliche Geschrei schon hinter der Gardine, das »Machen Sie mich die Türe auf!«, die Streitigkeiten mit dem Stallmeister und dann, in breitem und jammerndem Englisch-Deutsch, eine Reihe von Erzählungen.

"Da, plötzlich, trat dieser Moment ein … ereignete sich etwas Lautloses, Erschreckendes.

"Es war eine sehr schöne Szene, als der Konsul zum ersten Male seine Braut ins Landschaftszimmer und zu seiner Mutter führte, die ihr mit ausgebreiteten Armen, den Kopf zur Seite geneigt, entgegenkam. Gerda, die mit freier und stolzer Anmut auf dem hellen Teppich dahinschritt, war hoch und üppig gewachsen.

Ihr Gesicht war mattweiß und ein wenig hochmütig; aber sie neigte es dennoch, als die Konsulin ihr Haupt mit sanfter Innigkeit zwischen beide Hände nahm und ihr die schneeige, makellose Stirne küßte … »Ja, nun heiße ich dich willkommen in unserem Hause und unserer Familie, du liebe, schöne, gesegnete Tochter«, sagte sie. »Du wirst ihn glücklich machen … sehe ich es nicht schon, wie glücklich du ihn machst?« Und sie zog mit dem rechten Arme Thomas herbei, um ihn ebenfalls zu küssen.","It was a very beautiful scene when the consul for the first time led his bride into the landscape room and to his mother, who came to meet her with outstretched arms and her head on one side.

He climbed it cautiously—on tiptoe, holding his breath, listening for any sound. His homeroom, for students in their sophomore year of the modern curriculum, was on the second floor, directly across from the stairs. The door was open.

"Was Direktor Wulicke persönlich betraf, so war er von der rätselhaften, zweideutigen, eigensinnigen und eifersüchtigen Schrecklichkeit des alttestamentlichen Gottes.

Er war imstande, etwas Scherzhaftes zu sagen und fürchterlich zu werden, wenn man lachte. Keine seiner zitternden Kreaturen wußte Rat, wie man sich ihm gegenüber zu benehmen habe.

"Hanno ging zu seinem Platz, der sich ungefähr inmitten des Zimmers befand, schob die Mappe ins Fach, sank auf den harten Sitz, legte die Arme auf die schräge Platte und bettete seinen Kopf darauf. Ein unsägliches Wohlgefühl durchrieselte ihn. Diese kahle und harte Stube war häßlich und hassenswert, und auf seinem Herzen lastete der ganze drohende Vormittag mit tausend Gefahren. Aber er war doch fürs erste in Sicherheit, war körperlich geborgen und konnte die Dinge an sich herankommen lassen. Auch war die erste, die Religionsstunde bei Herrn Ballerstedt ziemlich harmloser Natur … An dem Vibrieren des Papierzüngleins dort oben vor der kreisrunden Öffnung in der Wand sah man, wie die warme Luft hereinströmte, und auch die Gasflammen heizten den Raum. Ach, man konnte sich strecken und die starr-feuchten Glieder langsam sich lösen und auftauen lassen. Eine wohlige und ungesunde Hitze stieg in seinen Kopf hinauf, summte in seinen Ohren und verschleierte seine Augen …","Hanno went to his place, which was roughly in the middle of the room, put the folder in the drawer, sank down on the hard seat, laid his arms on the sloping board and laid his head on it.

But for now he was safe, physically safe and able to let things get to him. The first, the religion lesson with Herr Ballerstedt, was also of a fairly harmless nature... You could tell from the vibrating of the paper tongue up there in front of the circular opening in the wall how the warm air streamed in, and the gas flames also heated the room. Oh, you could stretch and let your stiff, damp limbs slowly loosen and thaw.

But for the moment he was safe and sound, and all the rest could take its course. And the first hour, religion with Herr Ballerstedt, was a rather harmless affair. The vibrating ribbons of paper tied to the circular opening in the wall above him showed that warm air was streaming into the room, and the gas lamps were helping to heat it as well.

But for the moment he was safe; he had saved his skin, and could take things as they came. The first lesson, Herr Ball erst edt's class in religious instruction, was comparatively harmless. He could see, by the vibration of the little strips of paper over the ventilator next the ceiling, that warm air was streaming in, and the gas, too, did its share to heat the room.

"Die Sonntage aber und die Ferien verlebte Tony in der Mengstraße oder draußen bei den Großeltern.

Aber welch Weihnachtsfest, vor allem, mit drei Bescherungen: zu Hause, bei den Großeltern und bei Sesemi, woselbst an diesem Abend der Bischof in Strömen floß … Am herrlichsten aber war dennoch der Weihnachtsabend zu Hause, denn der Konsul hielt darauf, daß das heilige Christfest mit Weihe, Glanz und Stimmung begangen ward. Wenn man in tiefer Feierlichkeit im Landschaftszimmer versammelt war, während die Dienstboten und allerlei alte und arme Leute, denen der Konsul die blauroten Hände drückte, sich in der Säulenhalle drängten, dann erscholl dort draußen vierstimmiger Gesang, den die Chorknaben der Marienkirche vollführten, und man bekam Herzklopfen, so festlich war es. Dann, während schon durch die Spalten der hohen, weißen Flügeltür der Tannenduft drang, verlas die Konsulin aus der alten Familienbibel mit den ungeheuerlichen Buchstaben langsam das Weihnachtskapitel, und war draußen noch ein Gesang verklungen, so stimmte man »O Tannebaum« an, während man sich in feierlichem Umzuge durch die Säulenhalle in den Saal begab, den weiten Saal mit den Statuen in der Tapete, wo der mit weißen Lilien geschmückte Baum flimmernd, leuchtend und duftend zur Decke ragte und die Geschenktafel von den Fenstern bis zur Tür reichte.

Then, while the scent of the fir trees was already penetrating through the cracks in the high, white double doors, the Consul slowly read the Christmas chapter from the old family Bible with the monstrous letters, and when a song had faded outside, they sang ""O Christmas tree"" while went in solemn procession through the portico into the hall, the wide hall with the statues in the wallpaper, where the tree adorned with white lilies rose to the ceiling, shimmering, luminous and fragrant, and the table of presents reached from the windows to the door. But outside, on the hard-frozen snow of the streets, the Italian barrel-organ men played music, and the hustle and bustle of the Christmas market echoed across from the market square.

The most splendid time, however, was always on Christmas Eve at home, for the consul insisted that the Holy Feast of the Christ Child be celebrated in an atmosphere of stately radiance. Once they had all solemnly gathered in the landscape room, while the servants and all sorts of poor and old people had crowded into the entrance hall downstairs to have their blue and ruddy hands shaken by the consul, the choirboys of St. Mary’s would strike up a carol in four-part harmony—it was so festive that it simply made her heart pound. Then, with the scent of fir drifting through the cracks of the closed high white doors, her mother would read the Christmas story from the old family Bible with its huge funny letters; and once the last echoes of a second carol had died away outside, they would begin singing “O, Tannenbaum” as they moved in solemn procession through the columned hallway and into the dining room, where the wallpaper had white statues and the radiant, fragrant tree reached to the ceiling and was decorated with white lilies and flickering candles and the table, laden with gifts, reached from the windows to the door. Meanwhile Italians were playing barrel organs outside in the snow-covered streets, and from far off you could hear the hubbub from the Christmas market in the town square. Except for little Clara, all the children joined the adults in the columned hall for a late supper at a table heaped with carp and turkey with dressing.","Sundays and holidays Tony spent in Meng Street or outside the town with her grandparents. How lovely, when it was fine on Easter Sunday, hunting for eggs and marzipan hares in the enormous Kr�ger garden! Then there were the sum-mer holidays at the seashore; they lived in the Kurhouse, ate at the table-d'hote, bathed, and went donkey-riding. Some seasons when the Consul had business, there were long jour-neys. But Christmases were best of all. There were three present-givings: at home, at the grandparents', and at Sesemi's, where bishop flowed in streams. The one at home was the grandest, for the Consul believed in keeping the holy feast with pomp and ceremony. They gathered in the landscape-room with due solemnity. The servants and the crowd of poor people thronged into the pillared hall, where the Consul went about shaking their purple hands. Then outside rose the voices of the choir-boys from St. Mary's in a quartette, and one's heart beat loudly with awe and expectation. The smell of the Christmas tree was already coming through the crack in the great white folding doors; and the Frau Consul took the old family Bible with the funny big letters, and slowly read al^uud the Christmas chapter; and after the choir-hoys had sung another carol, everybody joined in ""O Tannenbaum"" and went in solemn procession through the hall into the great salon, hung with tapestries that had statuary woven into them. There the tree rose to the ceiling, decorated with white lilies, twinkling and sparkling and pouring out light and fragrance; and the table with the presents on it stretched from the windows to the door. Outside, the Italians with the barrel-organ were making music in the frozen, snowy streets, and a great hubbub came over from the Christmas market in Market Square. All the children except little Clara stopped up to late supper in the salon, and there were mountains of carp and stuffed turkey."
"Immerhin haben Deine Mutter und ich um die Mitte des Junius eine Fahrt nach Hamburg unternommen, um Deine Schwester Tony zu besuchen.

"Frau Permaneder kam die Haupttreppe herauf, indem sie vorn mit der Hand ihr Kleid emporraffte und mit der anderen die große, braune Muff gegen ihre Wange drückte. Sie stürzte und stolperte mehr als daß sie ging, ihr Kapotthut war unordentlich aufgesetzt, ihre Wangen waren hitzig, und auf ihrer ein wenig vorgeschobenen Oberlippe standen kleine Schweißtropfen. Obgleich ihr niemand begegnete, sprach sie unaufhörlich im Vorwärtshasten, und aus ihrem Flüstern löste sich dann und wann mit plötzlichem Vorstoße ein Wort los, dem die Angst lauten Ton verlieh … »Es ist nichts …« sagte sie. »Es hat gar nichts zu bedeuten … Der liebe Gott wird das nicht wollen … Er weiß, was er tut; den Glauben bewahre ich mir … Es hat ganz sicherlich nichts zu sagen … Ach, du Herr, tagtäglich will ich beten …« Sie plapperte einfach Unsinn vor Angst, stürzte die Treppe zur zweiten Etage hinauf und über den Korridor …","Frau Permaneder came up the main staircase, raising her dress up in front with one hand and pressing the large, brown muff against her cheek with the other.

Although she met no one, she spoke incessantly, hurrying on, and now and then a word broke out of her whisper with a sudden rush, which fear gave a loud tone to. . . .

She lunged and stumbled up the stairs more than she climbed them—the hood of her cloak sat wildly askew, her cheeks were flushed, and little beads of sweat had formed on her slightly protruding upper lip.

"»Ein schöner Name! Ich liebe, wenn ich das aussprechen darf« – und Herr Grünlich wandte sich wieder an den Hausherrn – »die Namen, welche schon an und für sich erkennen lassen, daß ihr Träger ein Christ ist. In Ihrer Familie ist, wie ich weiß, der Name Johann erblich … wer dächte dabei nicht an den Lieblingsjünger des Herrn. Ich zum Beispiel, wenn ich mir diese Bemerkung gestatten darf«, fuhr er mit Beredsamkeit fort, »heiße wie die meisten meiner Vorfahren Bendix, – ein Name, der ja nur als eine mundartliche Zusammenziehung von Benedikt zu betrachten ist. Und Sie lesen, Herr Buddenbrook? Ah, Cicero! Eine schwierige Lektüre, die Werke dieses großen römischen Redners.

I love, if I may say so"" - and Mr. Grünlich turned back to the landlord - ""the names which already show in and for themselves that their bearer is a Christian.

Quousque tandem, Catiline… ah-ah-hm, yeah, I haven’t completely forgotten my Latin either!”","“A beautiful name. I do love, if I may say so”—and Herr Grünlich turned again now to the head of the household—“those names that betray in and of themselves the faith of those who bear them. The name Johann is, I am aware, handed down in your family from generation to generation … and who would not be immediately reminded of our Lord’s beloved disciple. If I may be permitted to mention it,” he continued eloquently, “like most of my forebears, I am named Bendix—which may be regarded as a colloquial abbreviation of ‘Benedict.’ And what are you reading, Master Buddenbrook?

"Aus Besorgnis, ihn noch mehr zu reizen, antwortete der Konsul nicht. Der Wagen rollte mit hallendem Geräusch durch das Tor und befand sich drei Minuten später in der breiten Allee vor dem mit vergoldeten Spitzen versehenen Gatter, welches das Krögersche Besitztum begrenzte. Zu beiden Seiten der breiten Gartenpforte, die den Eingang zu einer mit Kastanien besetzten Anfahrt zur Terrasse bildete, brannten hell zwei Laternen mit vergoldeten Knöpfen auf ihren Deckeln. Der Konsul entsetzte sich, als er hier in das Gesicht seines Schwiegervaters sah. Es war gelb und von schlaffen Furchen zerrissen. Der kalte, feste und verächtliche Ausdruck, den der Mund bis dahin bewahrt, hatte sich zu einer schwachen, schiefen, hängenden und blöden Greisengrimasse verzerrt … Der Wagen hielt an der Terrasse.","Afraid of further irritating him, the consul did not reply. The carriage rolled through the gate with a resounding noise, and three minutes later was in the broad avenue in front of the gilded-tipped gate which bounded the Kroger estate. Two lanterns with gilded knobs on their lids burned brightly on either side of the broad garden gate, which formed the entrance to a chestnut-lined driveway to the terrace. The consul was shocked when he saw his father-in-law's face here. It was yellow and torn with slack furrows. The cold, firm and contemptuous expression that the mouth had kept until then had changed into a weak, crooked, hanging and stupid old man's grimace... The carriage stopped at the terrace.","Worried that he might upset the old man even more, the consul did not reply. The carriage rolled through the echoing tunnel of the gate and onto the broad avenue; within three minutes they were alongside the wrought-iron fence with gilt-tipped railings that bounded the Kröger estate. Two lanterns topped with golden knobs were burning brightly at each side of the wide entrance to the chestnut-lined drive that led up to the terrace. The consul was horrified by what the light revealed of his father-in-law’s face. It was yellow, ragged, deeply furrowed. The cold, hard, disdainful set of the mouth had given way to the feeble, skewed, limp, stupid grin of an old man. The carriage pulled to a halt by the terrace.","For fear of angering him further, the Consul made no an-swer. The carriage clattered through the gate, and three minutes later was in the broad avenue before the gilt-tipped railings that bounded the Kroger domain. A drive bordered with chestnut trees went from the garden gate up to the ter-race; and on either side of the gate a gilt-topped lantern was burning brightly. The Consul saw his father-in-law's face by this light--it was yellow and wrinkled; the firm, contemp-tuous set of the mouth had given way: it had changed to the lax, silly, distorted expression of a very old man. The car-riage stopped before the terrace."
"Kaum ein Gedanke streifte Herrn Grünlichs Person. Die Stadt und der gräßliche Auftritt im Landschaftszimmer und die Ermahnungen der Familie und Pastor Köllings lagen weit zurück. Hier würde sie nun jeden Morgen ganz sorglos erwachen … Diese Schwarzkopfs waren prächtige Leute. Gestern abend hatte es wahrhaftig eine Apfelsinenbowle gegeben, und man hatte auf ein glückliches Zusammenleben angestoßen. Man war sehr vergnügt gewesen. Der alte Schwarzkopf hatte Seegeschichten zum besten gegeben und der junge von Göttingen berichtet, wo er studierte … Aber es war doch sonderbar, daß sie noch immer seinen Vornamen nicht wußte! Sie hatte mit Spannung darauf geachtet, aber er war beim Abendessen nicht mehr genannt worden, und es hätte sich wohl nicht geschickt, danach zu fragen. Sie dachte angestrengt nach … Mein Gott, wie hieß der junge Mensch! Moor … Mord …? Übrigens hatte er ihr gut gefallen, dieser Moor oder Mord. Er hatte ein so gutmütig verschmitztes Lachen, wenn er um Wasser bat und statt dessen ein paar Buchstaben mit Zahlen dahinter nannte, so daß der Alte ganz böse wurde. Ja, das sei aber die wissenschaftliche Formel für Wasser … allerdings nicht für dieses Wasser, denn die Formel für diese Travemünder Flüssigkeit sei wohl viel komplizierter. Jeden Augenblick könne man eine Qualle darin finden … Die hohe Obrigkeit habe ihre eignen Begriffe von Süßwasser … Worauf ihm wieder ein väterlicher Verweis zuteil geworden war, weil er in wegwerfendem Tone von der Obrigkeit gesprochen hatte. Frau Schwarzkopf hatte immer in Tonys Gesicht nach Bewunderung gesucht, und wahrhaftig, er sprach sehr amüsant, zugleich lustig und gelehrt … Er hatte sich ziemlich viel um sie gekümmert, der junge Herr. Sie hatte geklagt, daß sie beim Essen einen heißen Kopf bekäme, sie glaube zu viel Blut zu haben … Was hatte er geantwortet? Er hatte sie gemustert und gesagt: Ja, die Arterien an den Schläfen seien gefüllt, aber das schließe nicht aus, daß nicht genug Blut oder genug rote Blutkörperchen im Kopfe seien … Sie sei vielleicht ein bißchen bleichsüchtig …","Hardly a thought touched Mr. Grünlich's person. The city and the horrible scene in the landscape room and the admonitions of the family and Pastor Kollings were far behind. Here she would wake up carefree every morning... These Schwarzkopfs were splendid people. Yesterday evening there really was an orange punch and a toast to a happy life together. They had been very happy. The old Schwarzkopf had told stories about the sea, and the young one from Gottingen, where he was studying... But it was strange that she still didn't know his first name! She'd been looking for it with anticipation, but he hadn't been mentioned again at dinner, and it probably wouldn't have been polite to ask. She thought hard... My God, what was the young man's name! Moor... Murder...? By the way, she had liked it, this moor or murder. He had such a good-natured, mischievous laugh when he asked for water and instead gave a few letters followed by numbers, so that the old man got very angry. Yes, but that is the scientific formula for water ... but not for this water, because the formula for this Travemünde liquid is probably much more complicated. A jellyfish could be found in it at any moment... The high authorities had their own notion of fresh water... Whereupon he had again received a paternal reprimand for speaking of the authorities in a dismissive tone. Mrs Schwarzkopf had always looked for admiration in Tony's face, and truly he spoke in a very amusing way, at the same time funny and learned... He had looked after her quite a bit, the young gentleman. She had complained that her head felt hot when she was eating, that she thought she had too much blood... What had he answered? He had looked her over and said: Yes, the arteries in the temples were full, but that doesn't mean that there wasn't enough blood or not enough red blood cells in the head... She might be a bit anaemic...","She gave barely a thought to Herr Grünlich. The city, that ghastly scene in the landscape room, her parents’ and Pastor Kölling’s reprimands—that all lay far behind her. She would wake up every morning here without a care in the world. These Schwarzkopfs were marvelous people. Yesterday evening there had even been orange punch and a toast to the fine time they would spend together. They had had such fun. Old Schwarzkopf had entertained them with sea yarns, and the younger one had told them about Göttingen, where he was studying. But how odd that she still didn’t know his first name. She had paid close attention, but it had not been mentioned once during dinner, and it hadn’t seemed quite proper to ask at that point. She concentrated hard—Lord, what was young Schwarzkopf’s name? Moore … Mort …? Whatever it was, Moore or Mort, she had liked him. He had such a good-natured, mischievous laugh, and when he had asked for water by using a couple of letters with some numbers added, his father had been simply furious. Yes, that was the scientific formula for water—though not for this water, because the formula for the liquid of Travemünde would be much more complicated. Why, you might discover a jellyfish in it any second. The authorities, now, they had their own definition of pure water. And this earned him another rebuke from his father, for speaking in such disparaging tones about the authorities. Frau Schwarzkopf had kept searching Tony’s face for some sign of admiration, and she had to admit that he was very amusing, so learned and funny at the same time. He had paid rather a lot of attention to her, the young man had. She had complained that when she ate her head always got hot, that she thought she had too much blood. And what was his answer? He had eyed her critically and said: Yes, the arteries at her temples were swollen, but that did not rule out that she might not have enough blood or blood corpuscles in her head. She might even have a touch of anemia.","Her thoughts scarcely touched upon the Gr�nlich affair. The town, his hateful apparition in the landscape room, the exhortations of her family and Pastor K�lling--all that lay far behind her. Here, every morning, there would be a care-free waking. These Schwarzkopfs were splendid people. Last night there had been pineapple punch, and they had made part of a happy family circle. It had been very jolly. Herr Schwarzkopf had told his best sea tales, and young Schwarzkopf stories about student life at G�ttingen. How odd it was, that she still did not know his first name! And she had strained her ear to hear too, but even at dinner she did not succeed, and somehow it did not seem proper to ask. She tried feverishly to think how it sounded--was it Moor--Mori--? Anyhow, she had liked him pretty well, this young Moor or Mord. He had such a sly, good-natured laugh when he asked for the water and called it by letters and numbers, so that his father got quite furious. But it was only the scientific formula for water--that is, for ordinary water, for the Travem�nde product was a much more complicated affair, of course. Why, one could find a jelly-fish in it, any time! The authorities, of course, might have what notions they chose about fresh water. For this he only got another scolding 125 from his father, for speaking slightingly of the authorities. But Frau Schwarzkopf watched Tony all the time, to see how much she admired the young man--and really, it was most interesting, he was so learned and so jolly, all at the same time. He had given her considerable attention. She had complained that her head felt hot, while eating, and that she must have too much blood. What had he replied? He had given her a careful scrutiny, and then said, Yes, the arteries in the temples might be full; but that did not prove that she had too much blood. Perhaps, instead, it meant she had too little--or rather, that there were too few red corpuscles in it. In fact, she was perhaps a little anemic."

"Der Alte mochte sich erinnern, wie er vor 46 Jahren zum erstenmal am Sterbebette einer Gattin gesessen hatte, und er mochte der wilden Verzweiflung, die damals in ihm aufbegehrt war, die nachdenkliche Wehmut vergleichen, mit der er, nun selbst so alt, in das veränderte, ausdruckslose und entsetzlich gleichgültige Gesicht der alten Frau blickte, die ihm niemals ein großes Glück, niemals einen großen Schmerz bereitet, die aber viele lange Jahre mit klugem Anstand bei ihm ausgehalten und nun ebenfalls langsam davonging.","The old man might remember how he had sat by the deathbed of a wife for the first time 46 years ago, and he might like to compare the wild desperation that arose within him at the time to the thoughtful melancholy with which he, now so old himself, changed, expressionless and horribly indifferent face of the old woman, who never brings him much happiness, never brings him much pain, but who endured with him with wise decency for many long years and now also slowly walked away.","Perhaps the old man was thinking about how he had sat beside the bed of a dying wife that first time, forty-six years before, and perhaps he compared the savage despair that had blazed within him then with the pensive melancholy that showed in his eyes now as he gazed, an old man himself, at the altered, expressionless, and terrifyingly indifferent face of this old woman, who had brought him neither great happiness nor great pain, but who had stood beside him with such clever, good grace over these many long years, and whose life was also now ebbing away.","Perhaps the old man was thinking how he had sat at the death-bed of his first wife, forty-six years before. Perhaps he recalled his frenzy of despair and contrasted it with the gentle melancholy which he felt now, as an old man, gazing into the face of his old wife--a face so changed, so listless, so void of expression. She had never given him either a great joy or a great sorrow; but she had decorously played her part beside him for many a long year--and now her life was ebbing away.

Es war nun wieder still genug, die leisen Drehorgelklänge zu vernehmen, die von einer fernen Straße durch den kalten Abend daherkamen.","Hanno was left alone in the hall, because little Elisabeth Weinschenk had been taken home, while he was allowed to stay for dinner in Mengstrasse for the first time this year, the maids and the house poor had retired with their presents, and Ida Jungmann chatted in of the columned hall with Riekchen Severin, although, as governess, she usually maintained a strict social distance from the maid. The lights of the great tree had burned down and were extinguished, so that the crib now lay in darkness; but a few candles on the little trees on the table were still burning, and here and there a twig came within reach of a little flame, singed crackling, and increased the scent that pervaded the hall.

The candles on the tall tree had burned down and gone out, leaving the manger in darkness; but a few candles were still burning on the trees on the table; now and then a sprig would crackle as it was singed by a nearby flame, adding to the fragrance that filled the room.

In particular Thomas enjoyed his imitation of Herr Marcellus Stengel, who worked very hard at instructing his students in singing, drawing, and similar diverting disciplines.","Thomas had been marked from the cradle as a merchant and future member of the firm. He was on the modern side of the old school which the boys attended; an able, quick-witted, intelligent lad, always ready to laugh when his brother Christian mimicked the masters, which he did with uncanny facility. Christian, on the classical side, was not less gifted than Tom, but he was less serious. His special and particular joy in life was the imitation, in speech and manner, of a cer-tain worthy Marcellus Stengel, who taught drawing, singing, and some other of the lighter branches."

He found satisfaction in telling himself that, no matter how hopeless and thwarted he felt his own life to be, when it came to his son, he was capable of exhilarating dreams of a future full of competence and a natural love of hard, practical work—full of success, achievement, power, wealth, honor.

"Es war kein Schade, daß Tony auf ihren Gängen durch die Stadt alle Welt kannte und mit aller Welt plauderte; der Konsul zumal war hiermit einverstanden, weil es keinen Hochmut, sondern Gemeinsinn und Nächstenliebe verriet. Sie kletterte, gemeinsam mit Thomas, in den Speichern an der Trave zwischen den Mengen von Hafer und Weizen umher, die auf den Böden ausgebreitet waren, sie schwatzte mit den Arbeitern und den Schreibern, die dort in den kleinen dunklen Kontoren zu ebener Erde saßen, ja, sie half sogar draußen beim Aufwinden der Säcke. Sie kannte die Schlachter, die mit ihren weißen Schürzen und Mulden durch die Breite Straße wanderten; sie kannte die Milchfrauen, die mit ihren Blechkannen vom Lande hereinkamen und ließ sich manchmal ein Stück von ihnen kutschieren; sie kannte die graubärtigen Meister in den kleinen, hölzernen Goldschmiedebuden, die in die Marktarkaden hineingebaut waren, die Fisch-, Obst- und Gemüsefrauen auf dem Markte, sowie die Dienstmänner, die an den Straßenecken ihren Tabak kauten … Gut und schön!","It was no pity that Tony knew and chatted with everyone as she walked around town; the consul in particular agreed to this because it did not betray arrogance, but public spirit and charity. She climbed, together with Thomas, in the warehouses on the Trave between the masses of oats and wheat that were spread on the floors, she chatted with the workers and the clerks who sat there in the small, dark offices on the ground floor, yes, she even helped unwind the sacks outside. She knew the butchers who wandered down the Breite Strasse in their white aprons and troughs; she knew the milkmaids who came in from the country with their tin cans and sometimes let them drive her a little; she knew the grey-bearded masters in the small, wooden goldsmith's huts built into the market arcades, the fish, fruit and vegetable women in the market, and the servants who chewed their tobacco on the street corners... Good and nice!","There was nothing wrong with the fact that Tony knew everyone on the streets of town, and would chat with almost anyone; the consul was quite agreeable to that, because it revealed a sense of community and love of neighbor, rather than conceit. Together with Thomas, she would scramble about among the piles of oats and wheat spread out in the lofts of the warehouses along the Trave, she would chatter away with the workers and the clerks who sat in their little dim offices on the ground floor, she would even help hoist the sacks on the pulleys. She knew the butchers in white aprons who came walking down Breite Strasse carrying trays of meat; she knew the women who came in from the country with their tin cans of milk, and sometimes she even asked for a ride in their carts; she knew the gray-bearded master goldsmiths who worked in little wooden booths built into the arcades along the market square, knew the women who sold fish, fruit, and vegetables at the market and the porters idling on street corners, chewing tobacco. All fine and good.","There was, of course, no harm in the fact that the child knew everybody in town. The Consul quite approved of this, and argued that it displayed love of one's neighbour, a sense of human fellowship, and a lack of snobbishness. So Tony, on her way through the streets, chattered with all and sundry. She and Tom would clamber about in the granaries un the water-side, among the piles of oats and wheat, prat-tling to the labourers and the clerks in the dark little ground-floor offices; they would even help haul up the sacks of grain. She knew the butchers with their trays and aprons, when she met them in Broad Street; she accosted the dairy women when they came in from the country, and made them take her a little way in their carts. She knew the grey-bearded crafts-men who sat in the narrow goldsmiths' shops built into the arcades in the market square; and she knew the fish-wives, the fruit- and vegetable-women, and the porters that stood on the street corners chewing their tobacco.

"Mit diesem Einfalle erklärte Tony sich freudig einverstanden.

Er hatte, abgesehen von der ersten Begrüßung, noch nicht Gelegenheit gehabt, mit Christian zu sprechen; aber er hatte ihn heute während der Feierlichkeit aufmerksam beobachtet und gesehen, daß er ungewöhnlich ernst und unruhig gewesen war, ja, daß er im Verlaufe von Pastor Pringsheims Rede einmal sogar aus irgendwelchen Gründen den Saal für mehrere Minuten verlassen hatte … Thomas hatte ihm keine Zeile mehr geschrieben seit jenem Tage in Hamburg, an dem Christian zehntausend Mark Kurant von seinem Erbe im voraus aus seinen Händen zur Deckung von Schulden empfangen. »Fahre nur so fort!« hatte der Konsul gesagt. »Dann werden deine Groschen rasch vertan sein.

"Lebertran und Rizinusöl waren gute Dinge, aber darin war Doktor Langhals vollständig mit dem Senator einig, daß sie allein nicht hinreichten, den kleinen Johann zu einem tüchtigen und wetterfesten Manne zu machen, wenn er selbst nicht das Seine dazu täte. Da waren zum Beispiel, geleitet von dem Turnlehrer Herrn Fritsche, die Turnspiele, die zur Sommerszeit allwöchentlich draußen auf dem »Burgfelde« veranstaltet wurden und der männlichen Jugend der Stadt Gelegenheit gaben, Mut, Kraft, Gewandtheit und Geistesgegenwart zu zeigen und zu pflegen. Aber zum Zorne seines Vaters legte Hanno nichts als Widerwillen, einen stummen, reservierten, beinahe hochmütigen Widerwillen gegen solche gesunde Unterhaltungen an den Tag … Warum hatte er so gar keine Fühlung mit seinen Klassen- und Altersgenossen, mit denen er später zu leben und zu wirken haben würde? Warum hockte er beständig nur mit diesem kleinen, halb gewaschenen Kai zusammen, der ja ein gutes Kind, aber immerhin eine etwas zweifelhafte Existenz und kaum eine Freundschaft für die Zukunft war? Auf irgendeine Weise muß ein Knabe sich das Vertrauen und den Respekt seiner Umgebung, die mit ihm aufwächst und auf deren Schätzung er für sein ganzes Leben angewiesen ist, von Anfang an zu gewinnen wissen. Da waren die beiden Söhne des Konsuls Hagenström: vierzehn- und zwölfjährig, zwei Prachtkerle, dick, stark und übermütig, die in den Gehölzen der Umgegend regelrechte Faustduelle veranstalteten, die besten Turner der Schule waren, schwammen wie Seehunde, Zigarren rauchten und zu jeder Schandtat bereit waren. Sie waren gefürchtet, beliebt und respektiert. Ihre Cousins, die beiden Söhne des Staatsanwaltes Doktor Moritz Hagenström andererseits, von zarterer Konstitution und sanfteren Sitten, zeichneten sich auf geistigem Gebiete aus und waren Musterschüler, ehrgeizig, devot, still und bienenfleißig, bebend aufmerksam und beinahe verzehrt von der Begier, stets Primus zu sein und das Zeugnis Numero Eins zu erhalten. Sie erhielten es und genossen die Achtung ihrer dümmeren und fauleren Genossen. Was aber mochten, ganz abgesehen von seinen Lehrern, seine Mitschüler von Hanno halten, der ein höchst mittelmäßiger Schüler war und obendrein ein Weichling, welcher allem, wozu ein wenig Mut, Kraft, Gewandtheit und Munterkeit gehörte, scheu aus dem Wege zu gehen suchte? Und wenn Senator Buddenbrook, auf dem Wege zu seinem Ankleidezimmer, an dem »Altan« in der zweiten Etage vorüberging, so hörte er aus dem mittleren der drei dort oben gelegenen Zimmer, das Hannos war, seitdem er zu groß geworden, bei Ida Jungmann zu schlafen, die Töne des Harmoniums oder Kais halblaute und geheimnisvolle Stimme, die eine Geschichte erzählte …","Cod liver oil and castor oil were good things, but Doctor Langhals was in complete agreement with the senator that they alone were not enough to make little Johann a capable and resilient man if he didn't do his part. For example, there were the gymnastics games, conducted by the gymnastics teacher Herr Fritsche, which were held every week in the summertime outside on the ""Burgfelde"" and gave the young men of the city the opportunity to show and cultivate courage, strength, dexterity and presence of mind. But to his father's anger, Hanno displayed nothing but repugnance, a mute, reserved, almost arrogant repugnance to such healthy conversations... Why did he have so little contact with his classmates and contemporaries, with whom he would later live and work would have? Why was he always huddled with this little, half-washed Kai, who was a good kid but had a rather dubious existence and was hardly a friendship for the future? In some way a boy has to win the trust and respect of those around him who grow up with him and on whose esteem he depends throughout his life. There were Consul Hagenstrom's two sons: fourteen and twelve years old, two splendid fellows, fat, strong and high-spirited, who fought veritable fist duels in the surrounding woods, were the best gymnasts in the school, swam like seals, smoked cigars and did every outrage were ready. They were feared, loved and respected. Her cousins, the two sons of the public prosecutor, Doctor Moritz Hagenstrom, on the other hand, of a more delicate constitution and gentler morals, distinguished themselves intellectually and were model pupils, ambitious, submissive, quiet and diligent, tremblingly attentive and almost consumed by the desire to always be first class and to receive the Number One testimony. They received it and enjoyed the respect of their more stupid and lazy comrades. But what did his fellow pupils, quite apart from his teachers, think of Hanno, who was a most mediocre pupil and a wimp at that, who shyly tried to avoid anything that required a little courage, strength, agility and vivacity? And when Senator Buddenbrook passed the balcony on the second floor on his way to his dressing room, he would listen to Ida Jungmann from the middle of the three rooms upstairs, which Hannos had used since he had grown too big sleeping, the sounds of the harmonium or Kai's soft and mysterious voice telling a story...","Cod-liver oil and castor oil were fine things, but Dr. Langhals was in total agreement with the senator that they were not sufficient in themselves to make a sturdy, rugged young man of little Johann—he had to do his part as well. For example, there were the gymnastic games that were supervised by Herr Fritsche, the physical-education teacher, and held out on Castle Yard once a week all through the summer—and there the town’s young males were given a chance to show and develop their courage, strength, agility, and reflexes. But, to his father’s annoyance, Hanno reacted to these healthy exercises with aversion—silent, aloof, almost arrogant aversion. Why did he have so little contact with boys his own age, his classmates, with whom he would later have to live and work? Why was he forever huddled with that little unwashed Kai, who was a good lad but a somewhat dubious fellow nevertheless, and hardly a proper friend for the future? In one way or another, from the very beginning, a boy has to earn the trust and respect of those around him, of the other boys he grows up with, whose good opinion will prove important to him for the rest of his life. There were Consul Hagenström’s two sons, ages fourteen and twelve, two fine stout lads, strong and high-spirited, who organized real boxing matches in the woods outside of town, who were the best gymnasts in school, swam like seals, smoked cigarettes, and were ready for any kind of mischief. They were feared, loved, and respected. Their cousins, on the other hand, the two sons of Dr. Moritz Hagenström the lawyer, were more delicate and gentle by nature, but they excelled in their studies and were model students—ambitious, respectful, quiet, and busy as bees, they almost quivered with alertness and were consumed with the idea of being the best in the class and bringing home a report card marked “Number One.” And they did just that, which won them the respect of their dumber, lazier classmates. But what did those same boys—quite apart from the teachers—think of Hanno, who was a very average student and a weakling to boot, who timidly tried to avoid anything that demanded a little courage, strength, agility, or enthusiasm? And if Senator Buddenbrook would happen to pass the third-floor “balcony” on his way to his dressing room, he often heard sounds coming from the middle room of the three—Hanno’s room, now that he was too old to sleep with Ida Jungmann—either the tones of the harmonium or Kai’s hushed, mysterious voice telling a story.","Cast or-oil and cod-liver oil were excellent things. But Dr. Langhals was quite at one with the Senator in the virw that they could not of themselves make a sound and sturdy citizen of little J oh aim if he did not do his part. There was gymnasium drill once a week in the summer, out on the Castle Field, where the youth of the city were given the op-portunity to develop their strength and courage, their skill and presence of mind, under the guidance of Herr Fritsche, the drill-master. But to his father's annoyance, Hanno shelved a distinct distaste for the manly sports--a silent, pronounced, almost haughty opposition. Why was it that he cared so little for playmates of his own class and age, with whom he would have to live, and was for ever sticking about with this little unwashed Kai, who was a good child, of course, but not precisely a proper friend for the future? Somehow or other a boy must know from the beginning how to gain the confidence and respect of his comrades, upon whose good opinion of him he will be dependent for the rest of his life! There were, on the other hand, the two sons of Consul Hagenstrbm, two fine strapping boys, twelve and four-teen years old, strong and full of spirits, who instituted prize-fights in the neighbouring woods, were the best gymnasts in the school, swam like otters, smoked cigars, and were ready for any deviltry. They were popular, feared, and respected. Their cousins, the two sons of Dr. Moritz Hagenstrbm, the State Attorney, were of a more delicate build, and gentler ways. They distinguished themselves in scholarship, and were BUDDENBRO DKS model pupils: zealous, industrious, quiet, attentive, devoured by the ambition to bring home a report card marked ""Number 1. "" They achieved their ambition, and were re-spected by their stupider and lazier colleagues. But--not to speak of his masters--what must his fellow-pupils think of Hanno, who was not only a very mediocre scholar, but a weakling into the bargain; who tried to get out of everything for which a scrap of courage, strength, skill, and energy were needed? When Senator Buddenbrook passed the little balcony on his way to his dressing-room, he would hear from Hanno's room, which was the middle one of the three on that floor since he had grown too large to sleep with Ida Jungmann, the notes of the harmonium, or the hushed and mysterious voice of Kai, Count Molln telling a story."
"Auch Madame Kethelsen hatte den Frieden.

Strenger als jemals zog er Hanno in dieser Zeit zu praktischen Vorübungen für sein künftiges, tätiges Leben heran, examinierte er seine Geisteskräfte, drang er in ihn nach entschlossenen Äußerungen der Lust zu dem Beruf, der seiner harrte, und brach in Zorn aus bei jedem Zeichen des Widerstrebens und der Mattigkeit … Denn es war an dem, daß Thomas Buddenbrook, achtundvierzig Jahre alt, seine Tage mehr und mehr als gezählt betrachtete und mit seinem nahen Tode zu rechnen begann.","He didn't pay attention to it, he resisted paying attention to it. During this time he used Hanno more strictly than ever for practical preliminary exercises for his future, active life, he examined his mental powers, urged him to express his enthusiasm for the profession that awaited him, and broke out in anger at every sign of reluctance and weariness ... For it was at that time that Thomas Buddenbrook, forty-eight years old, considered his days numbered more and more and began to reckon with his approaching death.","But Thomas disregarded what had happened, worked hard to disregard it. And so, in the period that followed, he was stricter than ever about drilling Hanno in the practical things that would be important in his future life and work; he examined his intellectual abilities, pressed him for decisive statements about his love of the occupation awaiting him, and burst into rage at every sign of resistance and languor. The fact was that Thomas Buddenbrook, at forty-eight, had begun to count his days more and more, to reckon with the approach of death.","He did not realize this--he tried not to realize it. In the days that followed, he urged Hanno on more sternly than ever to practical preparations for his future career. He tested his mental powers, pressed him to commit himself upon the subject of his calling, and grew irritated at every sign of rebellion or fatigue. For the truth was that Thomas Bud-denbrook, at the age of forty-eight, began to feel that his days were numbered, and to reckon with his own approaching death."

"Er stand dort, hielt mit einer Hand den Schifferknoten auf seiner Brust erfaßt, scheuerte seine Zunge an einem Zahne, dem er mißtraute, und horchte auf die ernsten und gedämpften Stimmen, die aus dem Inneren des Zimmers zu ihm drangen. Sein Kopf mit dem lockig in die Schläfen fallenden hellbraunen Haar war zur Seite geneigt, und unter zusammengezogenen Brauen blickten seine goldbraunen, von bläulichen Schatten umlagerten Augen blinzelnd, mit einem abgestoßenen und grüblerischen Ausdruck zur Seite, einem Ausdruck, ganz ähnlich demjenigen, mit dem er an der Bahre seiner Großmutter den Blumengeruch und jenen anderen, fremden und doch so seltsam vertrauten Duft eingeatmet hatte.","He stood there, one hand grasping the knot on his chest, rubbing his tongue on a tooth he distrusted, and listening to the grave and muffled voices that came to him from within the room. His head, with light brown hair falling in curls at his temples, was tilted to one side, and beneath knitted brows his golden brown eyes, rimmed with bluish shadows, blinked aside with a repelled and brooding expression, an expression very similar to the one he wore at his grandmother's bier had inhaled the scent of flowers and that other, strange and yet so strangely familiar scent.","He stood there, one hand holding the knot of his sailor’s tie against his chest, his tongue scouring a tooth that he did not trust, and listened to the earnest, subdued voices coming from the room. His head was tilted to one side, and his light brown hair fell in curls over his temples; from beneath scowling eyebrows, he looked off to one side, frequently blinking his golden-brown eyes ringed with bluish shadows; and his face wore almost the same brooding, disgruntled expression it had worn the day he had stood beside his grandmother’s casket and breathed in the fragrance of the flowers and that other, strange, and yet oddly familiar odor.","He stood there, clutching his sailor's knot with one hand, felt with his tongue for a doubtful tooth, and listened to the earnest subdued voices which could be heard from inside. His head, with the curling light-brown hair, he held on one side, and his face with the frowning brows and blue-shadowed, gold-brown eyes, wore that same displeased and brooding look with which he had inhaled the odour of the flowers, and that other strange, yet half-familiar odour, by his grand-mother's bier."
"»Ja, du bist gereizt, Thomas, ich sehe es wohl. Du warst es von Anfang an, und gerade darum habe ich weitergeredet, um dir zu beweisen, daß du dich zu Unrecht beleidigt fühlst. Wenn ich mich aber frage, warum du gereizt bist, so kann ich mir nur sagen, daß du im Grunde doch nicht so ganz abgeneigt bist, dich mit der Sache zu beschäftigen. Denn ein so dummes Weib ich bin, das weiß ich aus mir selbst und von anderen Leuten, daß man im Leben über einen Vorschlag nur dann erregt und böse wird, wenn man sich in seinem Widerstande nicht ganz sicher fühlt und innerlich sehr versucht ist, darauf einzugehen.«","'Yes, you are irritated, Thomas, I can see that. It was you from the start, and that's why I kept talking, to prove to you that you were unjustly offended. But when I ask myself why you're irritated, I can only say to myself that you're actually not entirely averse to dealing with the matter. Because stupid as I am, I know from myself and from other people that in life one only becomes excited and angry about a suggestion if one does not feel quite sure of one's resistance and is inwardly very tempted to do so enter into.""","“Yes, you are angry, Thomas, I can see that well enough. You were from the start, and that’s why I’ve kept on talking, just to prove to you that you have no reason to be offended. But if I were to ask myself why you’re angry, I could only reply that ultimately it’s because you’re not so averse to the idea of getting involved in this. I may be a silly woman, but I’ve learned one thing about myself and others, and that is that one only gets upset and angry when one is not quite sure of one’s own power to resist an idea and is tempted deep down inside to go along with it.”","""Yes, you are vexed, Tom, I can see it. You were from the beginning, and I have kept on, on purpose, to ahow you you are wrong to feel yourself insulted. But I know the real reason why you are vexed: it is because you are not so firmly decided not to touch fhe business. I know I am silly; but I have noticed about myself--and about other peo-ple too--that we are most likely to get angry and excited in our op-position to some idea when we ourselves are not quite certain of our own position, and are inwardly tempted to take the other side."""
"»Mit Papa ist es zum Heulen«, sagte Tony, indem sie nach ihrer Gewohnheit starke Worte wählte. »Kann er jemals zur festgesetzten Zeit fertig sein?

It’s the same for every party, every time we go out. Can’t he remember to leave himself some time? Can’t he break off work when he’s supposed to and then walk slowly up the stairs?

Well, when it is already ten minutes too late, he remembers his appointment and comes upstairs, always two steps at a time, although he knows he will get palpitation at the top. And it is like that at every company, before every expedition. Isn't it possible for him to leave himself time enough? And stop soon enough? It's so irresponsible of him; you ought to talk to him about it, Mamma. """

"Alle hatten in sein Lachen eingestimmt, hauptsächlich aus Ehrerbietung gegen das Familienoberhaupt. Mme. Antoinette Buddenbrook, geborene Duchamps, kicherte in genau derselben Weise wie ihr Gatte. Sie war eine korpulente Dame mit dicken, weißen Locken über den Ohren, einem schwarz und hellgrau gestreiften Kleide ohne Schmuck, das Einfachheit und Bescheidenheit verriet, und mit noch immer schönen und weißen Händen, in denen sie einen kleinen, sammetnen Pompadour auf dem Schoße hielt. Ihre Gesichtszüge waren im Laufe der Jahre auf wunderliche Weise denjenigen ihres Gatten ähnlich geworden. Nur der Schnitt und die lebhafte Dunkelheit ihrer Augen redeten ein wenig von ihrer halb romanischen Herkunft; sie stammte großväterlicherseits aus einer französisch-schweizerischen Familie und war eine geborene Hamburgerin.","Everyone had joined in his laughter, mostly out of deference to the head of the family. Mme Antoinette Buddenbrook, née Duchamps, giggled in exactly the same way as her husband.

Her features had oddly resembled her husband's over the years. Only the cut and the lively darkness of her eyes spoke a little of her semi-Roman origins; she came from a French-Swiss family on her grandfather's side and was born in Hamburg.","They had all joined in the laughter, mainly out of respect for the head of the family. Madame Antoinette Buddenbrook, née Duchamps, giggled exactly like her husband.

Over the years, her features had curiously become very like her husband’s. Only the shape and lively dark hue of her eyes hinted at her half-Latin origins; her grandfather had been French-Swiss, but she was born in Hamburg.","They had all joined in his laughter, but largely as a mark of respect for the head of the family. Madame Antoinette Buddenbrook, born Duchamps, tittered in precisely the same way as her husband.

Her hands were still white and lovely, and she held a little velvet work-bag on her lap. It was strange to see how she had grown, in time, to look like her husband. Only her dark eyes, by their shape and their liveliness, sug-gested her half-Latin origin. On her grandfather's side Madame Buddenbrook was of French-Swiss stock, though born in Hamburg."

Now what?”","""A thousand thanks,"" said Herr Gr�nlich, apparently quite flattered.

"So war es nicht Übermut, daß Senator Buddenbrook im Sommer dieses Jahres 63 umherging und über dem Plane sann, sich ein großes, neues Haus zu bauen. Wer glücklich ist, bleibt am Platze. Seine Rastlosigkeit trieb ihn dazu, und seine Mitbürger hätten dies Unternehmen seiner »Eitelkeit« zurechnen können, denn es gehörte dazu. Ein neues Haus, eine radikale Veränderung des äußeren Lebens, Aufräumen, Umzug, Neuinstallierung mit Ausscheidung alles Alten und Überflüssigen, des ganzen Niederschlages vergangener Jahre: diese Vorstellungen gaben ihm ein Gefühl von Sauberkeit, Neuheit, Erfrischung, Unberührtheit, Stärkung … und er mußte alles dessen wohl bedürftig sein, denn er griff mit Eifer danach und hatte sein Augenmerk schon auf eine bestimmte Stelle gerichtet.","So it was not arrogance that Senator Buddenbrook went about in the summer of this year 63 pondering the plan of building a large new house. If you're happy, stay put. His restlessness drove him to it, and his fellow citizens could have attributed this undertaking to his ""vanity"" because it was part of it. A new house, a radical change in external life, tidying up, moving, reinstalling with the elimination of everything old and superfluous, all the residue of years gone by: these ideas gave him a feeling of cleanliness, newness, refreshment, virginity, invigoration... and he had to have it all must be in need of it, for he grabbed it eagerly and had already fixed his eyes on a certain spot.","It was not out of arrogance, then, that Senator Buddenbrook spent this summer of ’63 walking about with his mind full of plans to build a grand new house. A happy man stays where he is. But he was so restless that he felt driven to it, and his fellow citizens would also have been right to attribute the project to his “vanity,” because that played a role as well. A new house, a radical change in his outward life—that would mean packing, moving, refitting his life, casting aside everything old and superfluous, the detritus of years past. The idea made him feel clean, new, refreshed, inviolable, strong—and he must have needed such feelings, because he reached out eagerly to grab his idea, fixing his eye on one particular spot.","Thus, when, in the summer of 1863, Senator Buddenbrook went about with his mind full of plans for the building of a great new house, it was not arrogance which impelled him. He was driven by his own inability to be quiet--which his fellow-burghers would have been right in ascribing to his ""vanity""--for it was another manifestation of the same thing. To make a new home, and a radical change in his outward life; to pack up, to re-install himself afresh, to weed out all the accumulations of bygone years and set aside every-thing old or superfluous: all this, even in imagination, gave him feelings of freshness, newness, spotlessness, stimulation. All of which he must have craved indeed, for he attacked the plan with great enthusiasm, and already had his eye on a suitable location."

"Dein Schreiben ist mir richtig geworden. Auf seinen Gehalt eingehend, teile ich Dir mit, daß ich pflichtgemäß nicht ermangelt habe, Herrn Gr. über Deine Anschauung der Dinge in geziemender Form zu unterrichten; das Resultat jedoch war derartig, daß es mich aufrichtig erschüttert hat. Du bist ein erwachsenes Mädchen und befindest Dich in einer so ernsten Lebenslage, daß ich nicht anstehen darf, Dir die Folgen namhaft zu machen, die ein leichtfertiger Schritt Deinerseits nach sich ziehen kann. Herr Gr. nämlich brach bei meinen Worten in Verzweiflung aus, indem er rief, so sehr liebe er Dich und so wenig könne er Deinen Verlust verschmerzen, daß er willens sei, sich das Leben zu nehmen, wenn Du auf Deinem Entschlusse bestündest. Da ich das, was Du mir von einer anderweitigen Neigung schreibst, nicht ernst nehmen kann, so bitte ich Dich, Deine Erregung über den zugesandten Ring zu bemeistern und alles noch einmal bei Dir selbst mit Ernst zu erwägen. Meiner christlichen Überzeugung nach, liebe Tochter, ist es des Menschen Pflicht, die Gefühle eines anderen zu achten, und wir wissen nicht, ob Du nicht einst würdest von einem höchsten Richter dafür haftbar gemacht werden, daß der Mann, dessen Gefühle Du hartnäckig und kalt verschmähtest, sich gegen sein eigenes Leben versündigte. Das eine aber, welches ich Dir mündlich schon oft zu verstehen gegeben, möchte ich Dir ins Gedächtnis zurückrufen und freue ich mich, Gelegenheit zu haben, es Dir schriftlich zu wiederholen. Denn obgleich die mündliche Rede lebendiger und unmittelbarer wirken mag, so hat doch das geschriebene Wort den Vorzug, daß es mit Muße gewählt und gesetzt werden konnte, daß es feststeht und in dieser vom Schreibenden wohl erwogenen und berechneten Form und Stellung wieder und wieder gelesen werden und gleichmäßig wirken kann. – Wir sind, meine liebe Tochter, nicht dafür geboren, was wir mit kurzsichtigen Augen für unser eigenes, kleines, persönliches Glück halten, denn wir sind nicht lose, unabhängige und für sich bestehende Einzelwesen, sondern wie Glieder in einer Kette, und wir wären, so wie wir sind, nicht denkbar ohne die Reihe derjenigen, die uns vorangingen und uns die Wege wiesen, indem sie ihrerseits mit Strenge und ohne nach rechts oder links zu blicken, einer erprobten und ehrwürdigen Überlieferung folgten. Dein Weg, wie mich dünkt, liegt seit längeren Wochen klar und scharf abgegrenzt vor Dir, und du müßtest nicht meine Tochter sein, nicht die Enkelin Deines in Gott ruhenden Großvaters und überhaupt nicht ein würdig Glied unserer Familie, wenn Du ernstlich im Sinne hättest, Du allein, mit Trotz und Flattersinn Deine eigenen, unordentlichen Pfade zu gehen. Dies, meine liebe Antonie, bitte ich Dich, in Deinem Herzen zu bewegen. –","Your writing got me right. Regarding his salary, I will inform you that, as was my duty, I did not fail to pay Mr Gr. to teach about your view of things in a fitting manner; however, the result was such that it genuinely shook me. You are a grown-up girl and find yourself in such a serious situation that I cannot hesitate to point out the consequences that a careless step on your part can have. Mr. Gr. for at my words he broke into despair, exclaiming that he loved you so much and could so little bear your loss that he was willing to take his own life if you persisted in your decision. Since I cannot take seriously what you write to me about another inclination, I ask you to master your excitement about the ring that you have sent and to seriously consider everything again. In my Christian conviction, dear daughter, it is a man's duty to respect the feelings of another, and we do not know whether you would not some day be held liable by a supreme judge for the fact that the man whose feelings you are stubborn and cold spurned, sinned against his own life. But I would like to remind you of one thing that I have often said to you orally, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to repeat it to you in writing. For though oral speech may appear more vivid and immediate, the written word has the virtue of being able to be chosen and set at leisure, to be fixed and read again and again in that form and position well considered and calculated by the writer and can act evenly. - We were not born, my dear daughter, for what we short-sightedly believe to be our own little personal happiness, for we are not loose, independent and self-contained individuals, but like links in a chain, and we would be , as we are, unthinkable without the series of those who went before us and showed us the way, following with rigor and without looking left or right a tried and venerable tradition. Your path, it seems to me, has been clearly and sharply demarcated before you for some weeks, and you would not have to be my daughter, not the granddaughter of your grandfather, who rests in God, and not at all a worthy member of our family, if you seriously had in mind You alone, to go your own messy paths with defiance and fickleness. This, my dear Antonie, I ask you to move in your heart. –","Your letter duly received. As regards its contents, I should tell you that I did not fail dutifully to communicate to Herr Grünlich your view of the situation in an appropriate manner. The result of which, however, truly shocked me. You are a grown young lady and find yourself at such a serious crossroads in life that I do not scruple to point out the consequences that might result from any frivolous step on your part. Upon hearing what I had to say, Herr Grünlich became quite desperate, crying that he loved you so much and the pain of losing you would be so great that he was prepared to take his own life if you were to persist in your decision. Inasmuch as I cannot take seriously what you have written about another attachment, I would ask you to master your agitation about the ring you were sent and to weigh all this most seriously one more time. My Christian convictions, dear daughter, tell me it is our duty to have regard for the feelings of others, for we do not know whether one day you may not be held answerable before the Highest Judge because the man whom you have stubbornly and coldly scorned has been guilty of the sin of taking his own life. I would like you to recall, however, something that I have impressed upon you often enough in conversation, and which the present occasion allows me to repeat in writing. For, although the words we speak are more vivid and immediate, the written word has the advantage of having been chosen with great care and is fixed in a form that its author has weighed and considered, so that it may be read again and again to cumulative effect. We are not born, my dear daughter, to pursue our own small personal happiness, for we are not separate, independent, self-subsisting individuals, but links in a chain; and it is inconceivable that we would be what we are without those who have preceded us and shown us the path that they themselves have scrupulously trod, looking neither to the left nor to the right, but, rather, following a venerable and trustworthy tradition. Your path, it seems to me, has been obvious for many weeks now, its course clearly defined, and you would surely not be my daughter, the granddaughter of your grandfather, who rests now in God, indeed would not be a worthy link in our family’s chain if, of your own accord and out of stubbornness and frivolity, you seriously intended to follow an aberrant path of your own. I beg you, my dear Antonie, to ponder these things in your heart.","Your letter duly received. As regards its contents, I must tell you that I did not fail to communicate them to Herr Grunlich: the result was of such a nature as to shock me very much. You are a grown girl, and at a serious time of life, so I need not scruple to tell you the consequences that a frivolous step of yours may draw after it. Herr Griinlich, then, burst into despair at my announcement, declaring that he loved you so dearly, and could so little console himself for your loss, that he would be in a state to take his own life if you remain firm in your resolve. As I cannot take seriously what you write me of another attachment, I must beg you to master your excitement over the ring, and.consider everything again very carefully. It is my Christian conviction, my dear daughter, that one must have regard for the feelings of others. We do not know that you may not be made responsible by the most high Judge if a man whose feelings you have coldly and obstinately scorned should tres-pass against his own life. But the thing I have so often told you by word of mouth, I must recall again to your remem-brance, and I am glad to have the occasion to repeat it in writing; for though speech is more vivid and has the more immediate effect, the written word has the advantage that it can be chosen with pains and fixed in a form well-weighed and calculated by the writer, to be read over and over again, with proportionate effect.--My child, we are not born for that which, with our short-sighted vision, we reckon to be our own small personal happiness. We are not free, sepa-rate, and independent entities, but like links in a chain, and 147 We could not by any means be what we are without those who went before us and showed us the way, by following the straight and narrow path, not looking to right or left. Your path, it seems to me, has lain all these weeks sharply marked out for you, and you would not be my daughter, nor the granddaughter of your Grandfather who rests in God, nor a worthy member of our own family, if you really have it in your heart, alone, wilfully, and light-headedly to choose your own unregulated path. Your Mother, Thomas, Christian, and I beg you, my dear Antonie, to weigh all this in your heart. Mile."

"Tony blieb ein bißchen stehen, um auf ihre Nachbarin Julchen Hagenström zu warten, mit der sie den Schulweg zurückzulegen pflegte. Dies war ein Kind mit etwas zu hohen Schultern und großen, blanken, schwarzen Augen, das nebenan in der völlig von Weinlaub bewachsenen Villa wohnte. Ihr Vater, Herr Hagenström, dessen Familie noch nicht lange am Orte ansässig war, hatte eine junge Frankfurterin geheiratet, eine Dame mit außerordentlich dickem schwarzen Haar und den größten Brillanten der Stadt an den Ohren, die übrigens Semlinger hieß. Herr Hagenström, welcher Teilhaber einer Exportfirma – Strunck & Hagenström – war, entwickelte in städtischen Angelegenheiten viel Eifer und Ehrgeiz, hatte jedoch bei Leuten mit strengeren Traditionen, den Möllendorpfs, Langhals' und Buddenbrooks, mit seiner Heirat einiges Befremden erregt und war, davon abgesehen, trotz seiner Rührigkeit als Mitglied von Ausschüssen, Kollegien, Verwaltungsräten und dergleichen nicht sonderlich beliebt. Er schien es darauf abgesehen zu haben, den Angehörigen der alteingesessenen Familien bei jeder Gelegenheit zu opponieren, ihre Meinungen auf schlaue Weise zu widerlegen, die seine dagegen durchzusetzen und sich als weit tüchtiger und unentbehrlicher zu erweisen als sie. Konsul Buddenbrook sagte von ihm: »Hinrich Hagenström ist aufdringlich mit seinen Schwierigkeiten … Er muß es geradezu auf mich persönlich abgesehen haben; wo er kann, behindert er mich … Heute gab es eine Szene in der Sitzung der Zentral-Armen-Deputation, vor ein paar Tagen im Finanz-Departement …« Und Johann Buddenbrook fügte hinzu: »Ein oller Stänker!« – Ein anderes Mal kamen Vater und Sohn zornig und deprimiert zu Tische … Was passiert sei? Ach, nichts … Eine große Lieferung Roggen nach Holland sei ihnen verloren gegangen; Strunck & Hagenström hätten sie ihnen vor der Nase weggeschnappt; ein Fuchs, dieser Hinrich Hagenström …","Tony stopped a bit to wait for her neighbor Julchen Hagenstrom, with whom she used to go to school. This was a child with a little too high shoulders and big, bright, black eyes, who lived next door in the villa, which was completely covered with vines. Her father, Herr Hagenstrom, whose family had not been in the area for long, had married a young woman from Frankfurt, a lady with extraordinarily thick black hair and the city's largest diamonds on her ears, whose name was Semlinger, by the way. Mr. Hagenstrom, who was a partner in an export firm - Strunck & Hagenstrom - developed much zeal and ambition in town affairs, but had aroused some astonishment with his marriage among people of stricter traditions, the Möllendorpfs, Langhals' and Buddenbrooks, and was reluctant to do so , not particularly popular despite his activity as a member of committees, colleges, boards of directors and the like. He seemed bent on opposing the members of the long-established families at every opportunity, cleverly refuting their opinions, imposing his own, and proving to be far more capable and indispensable than they. Consul Buddenbrook said of him: 'Hinrich Hagenstrom is obtrusive about his difficulties... He must be out to get me personally; where he can, he hinders me... Today there was a scene in the meeting of the Central Poor Deputation, a few days ago in the Finance Department...' And Johann Buddenbrook added: 'An old rascal!' - Another time came Father and son angry and depressed at the table... What happened? Ah, nothing... They lost a large delivery of rye to Holland; Strunck & Hagenstrom would have snatched them from under their noses; a fox, this Hinrich Hagenstrom ...","Tony would stand and wait a while for her neighbor Julie Hagenström, with whom she usually walked to school. Julie, a girl with big bright black eyes and shoulders that she carried a little high, lived in the next villa, which was entirely overgrown with grapevines. Her father, Herr Hagenström, whose family was rather new to town, had married a young woman from Frankfurt—née Semlinger, by the way—a lady who had extraordinarily thick black hair and the largest diamond earrings in the city. Herr Hagenström, partner in the export firm of Strunck & Hagenström, took eager and ambitious interest in the affairs of the town, but his marriage had caused some astonishment among families with stricter traditions— the Möllendorpfs, the Langhalses, the Buddenbrooks. Quite apart from that, however, and despite his active participation on committees, councils, and boards of directors, he was not particularly well liked. He appeared determined to oppose the old established families every chance he got, to dispute their opinions with some wily argument or other, and to push through his own, establishing himself as more competent and indispensable than anyone else. Consul Buddenbrook once said of him: “Hinrich Hagenström is meddlesome and obstructive. He must be out to make me his personal target; he blocks me whenever he can. There was a scene today at the Central Committee for Paupers, and just a few days ago in the Finance Department.…” And Johann Buddenbrook added: “A damn troublemaker!” On another occasion both father and son came home to dinner angry and depressed. What had happened? Oh, nothing—they had lost a large consignment of rye to be shipped to Holland. Strunck & Hagenström had snapped it right from under their noses; a sly fox, that Hinrich Hagenström.","Tony always waited for her neighbour, little Julie Hagen-strum; the two children went to school together. Julie was a high-shouldered child, with large, staring black eyes, who lived close by in a vine-covered house. Her people had not been long in the neighbourhood. The father, Herr Hagen-str�m, had married a wife from Hamburg, with thick, heavy black hair and larger diamonds in her ears than any one had ever seen before. Her name was Semlinger. Hagenstr�m was partner in the export firm of Strunck and Hagenstr�m. He showed great zeal and ambition in municipal affairs, and was always acting on boards and committees and administra-tive bodies. But he was not very popular. His marriage had rather affronted the rigid traditions of the older families, like the M�llendorpfs, Langhals, and Buddenbrooks; and, for another thing, he seemed to enjoy thwarting their ideas at every turn--he would go to work in an underhand way to oppose their interests, in order to show his own superior fore-sight and energy. "" Heinrich Hagenstrbm makes trouble the whole time,"" the Consul would say. "" He seems to take a per-sonal pleasure in thwarting me. To-day he made a scene at the sitting of the Central Paupers' Deputation; and a few days ago in the Finance Department...."" ""The old skunk!"" Johann Buddenbrook interjected. Another time, father and son sat down to table angry and depressed. What was the matter? Oh, nothing.

"Alle übrigen Beschwerden waren ja nur Folgeerscheinungen dieses Mangels an roten Blutkörperchen, »sekundäre Erscheinungen«, wie Doktor Langhals sagte, indem er seine Fingernägel besah. Allein auch diesen sekundären Erscheinungen mußte unnachsichtig zu Leibe gegangen werden. Um die Zähne zu behandeln, zu füllen und gegebenen Falles zu extrahieren, dazu wohnte Herr Brecht mit seinem Josephus in der Mühlenstraße; und um die Verdauung zu regulieren, gab es Rizinusöl auf der Welt, gutes, dickes, silberblankes Rizinusöl, welches, aus einem Eßlöffel genommen, wie ein schlüpfriger Molch durch die Kehle glitschte und das man drei Tage lang roch, schmeckte, im Schlunde spürte, wo man ging und stand … Ach, warum war das alles doch so unüberwindlich widerlich?

Aber er erhielt sie nicht mehr.","All the rest of the troubles were just sequelae of this lack of red blood cells, ""secondary manifestations,"" as Doctor Langhals put it, looking at his fingernails. But even these secondary phenomena had to be dealt with relentlessly. In order to treat the teeth, to fill them and, if necessary, to extract them, Herr Brecht lived with his Josephus in Mühlenstrasse; and to regulate digestion there was castor oil in the world, good, thick, silvery castor oil, which, taken from a tablespoon, slid down your throat like a slippery newt, and which you smelled, tasted, felt in your gullet for three days, where you went and where you stood … Oh, why was it all so insurmountably disgusting? Only once - Hanno had been lying in bed quite ill, and his heart was particularly irregular - did Dr. Langhals, with a certain nervousness, proceed to prescribe a remedy that had made little Johann happy and had done him so much good: and those had been arsenic pills. As a result, Hanno often asked about it, driven by an almost tender need for these small, sweet, happy pills. But he no longer received them.","All his other illnesses were simply a consequence of his lack of red corpuscles—“secondary phenomena,” Dr. Langhals called them, while inspecting his fingernails. It was necessary, however, ruthlessly to attack such secondary phenomena. The care of his teeth—the fillings and extractions, if those were needed—was in the hands of Herr Brecht on Mühlen Strasse, the owner of Josephus; but for the care and regulation of his digestion, there was castor oil—good thick, silvery, shiny castor oil, which was administered with a teaspoon and slid down your throat like a slimy newt. And wherever you went and whatever you did for the next three days, you could still smell, taste, and feel it in your throat. Oh, why were all these things so incredibly repulsive? Only once—Hanno had been so ill that as he lay in bed he could feel his heart pump with unusual irregularity —had Dr. Langhals ever prescribed anything different, and that with some misgiving—a medicine that little Johann had liked and that had done him a world of good: arsenic pills. Hanno often asked for them later, too; he felt something like a tender yearning for the sweet solace of those little pills. But he was not given any more of them.","His otiler troubles were all consequent upon this lack of red corpuscles, it appeared: secondary phenomena, Dr. Langhals called them, looking at his fingernails. But it was necessary to attack these other enemies ruthlessly. As for the teeth, for these Herr Brecht and his Josephus lived in Mill Street: to take care of them, to fill them; when necessary, to extract them. And for the digestion there was castor-oil, thick, clear cast or-oil that slipped down your throat like a lizard, after which you smelled and tasted it for three days, sleeping 225 and waking. Oh, why were all these remedies of such surpassing nastiness? One single time--Hanno had been rather ill, and his heart action had shown unusual irregularity-- Dr . Langhals had with some misgiving prescribed a remedy which little Hanno had actually enjoyed, and whirh had done him a world of good. These were arsenic pills. But however much he asked to have the dose repeated--for he felt almost a yearning for these sweet, snothing little pills--Dr. Langhals never prescribed them again."
"»Horche du nur, mein Sohn!« sagte er mit mildem Nachdruck, und das Kind betrachtete ein wenig scheu des Organisten großen, beim Sprechen in die Höhe wandernden Kehlkopfapfel, worauf es sich leise und schnell an seinen Platz zurückbegab, als könne es die Fortsetzung des Spieles und der Gespräche kaum erwarten.","""Listen, my son,"" he said with mild emphasis, and the child looked a little timidly at the organist's large larynx, which moved up as he spoke, whereupon it quietly and quickly went back to its place, as if it could continue of the game and the talks.","“And now listen, my boy,” he said, with mild but firm emphasis.

"Denn so verhielt es sich. Christians »Qual« in der linken Seite war in letzter Zeit zu London so stark geworden, hatte sich in so reelle Schmerzen verwandelt, daß er alle seine kleineren Beschwerden darüber vergessen hatte. Er hatte sich nicht mehr zu helfen gewußt, hatte seiner Mutter geschrieben, er müsse nach Hause kommen, um sich von ihr pflegen zu lassen, hatte seinen Platz in London fahren lassen und war abgereist. Kaum aber in Hamburg angelangt, hatte er zu Bette gehen müssen, der Arzt hatte Gelenkrheumatismus festgestellt und Christian aus dem Hotel ins Krankenhaus schaffen lassen, da eine Weiterreise fürs erste unmöglich sei. Da lag er nun und diktierte seinem Wärter höchst trübselige Briefe …","Because that's how it was. Christian's ""torment"" in his left side had become so severe lately in London, had turned into such real pain that he had forgotten all his minor complaints about it. He hadn't been able to help himself, had written to his mother that he had to come home to be cared for by her, had given up his place in London and left. But as soon as he arrived in Hamburg, he had to go to bed, the doctor had diagnosed rheumatism in his joints and had Christian taken from the hotel to the hospital, since it was impossible to continue the journey for the time being. There he lay, dictating most sorrowful letters to his keeper...","This was indeed the case. Christian’s “ache” in his left side had recently grown so intense that it had turned into real pain, causing him to forget all his minor complaints. He had not known what else to do and had written his mother that he felt he must leave London and come home for her to nurse him; then he had simply quit his job and started on his way. But he had made it no farther than Hamburg and had taken to his bed; the doctor had diagnosed rheumatic fever and ordered Christian transferred from his hotel to a hospital, any further travel being impossible at present. And there he lay now, dictating very mournful letters to the nurse tending him.","For this was, in fact, the state of things. Christian's ""mis-ery"" in the left side had increased so much of late that it had become actual pain, severe enough to make him forget all smaller woes. He was quite helpless, and had written to his mother from London that he was coming home, for her to take care of him. He quit his situation in London and started off. but at Hamburg had been obligeJ to take to his bed; the doctor diagnosed his ailment as rheumatism of the joints, and he had been removed from his hotel to a hospital. Any further journey was for the time impossible. There he lay, and dictated to his attendant letters that betrayed extreme depression."
"Christian hatte sich durchaus nicht verschönt. Er war hager und bleich. Die Haut umspannte überall straff seinen Schädel, zwischen den Wangenknochen sprang die große, mit einem Höcker versehene Nase scharf und fleischlos hervor, und das Haupthaar war schon merklich gelichtet. Sein Hals war dünn und zu lang, und seine mageren Beine zeigten eine starke Krümmung nach außen … Übrigens schien sein Londoner Aufenthalt ihn am nachhaltigsten beeinflußt zu haben, und da er auch in Valparaiso am meisten mit Engländern verkehrt hatte, so hatte seine ganze Erscheinung etwas Englisches angenommen, was nicht übel zu ihr paßte. Es lag etwas davon in dem bequemen Schnitt und dem wolligen, durablen Stoff seines Anzuges, in der breiten und soliden Eleganz seiner Stiefel und in der Art, wie sein rotblonder, starker Schnurrbart mit etwas säuerlichem Ausdruck ihm über den Mund hing. Ja selbst seine Hände, die von jenem matten und porösen Weiß waren, wie die Hitze es hervorbringt, machten mit ihren rund und kurz geschnittenen sauberen Nägeln aus irgendwelchen Gründen einen englischen Eindruck.","Christian hadn't embellished himself at all. He was gaunt and pale. The skin was tight all over his skull, the large, humped nose protruded sharply and fleshlessly between the cheekbones, and the hair on his head was noticeably thinner. His neck was thin and too long, and his skinny legs showed a strong outward curve. Incidentally, it was his stay in London that seemed to have had the most lasting influence on him, and since he had also been in Valparaiso with the most Englishmen, there was something about his whole appearance English accepted, which suited her well. There was something of it in the comfortable cut and the woolly, durable fabric of his suit, in the broad and solid elegance of his boots, and in the way his heavy reddish-blond mustache hung over his mouth with a somewhat sour expression. Indeed, even his hands, which were that dull and porous white that the heat produces, with their round, short-trimmed, clean nails, for some reason made an English impression.","Christian had certainly not grown any handsomer. He was gaunt and pale. His skin was stretched tight across his skull, his large, fleshless nose with its distinct hump protruded sharply between his cheekbones, and his hair had thinned quite noticeably. His neck was thin and too long, and his skinny legs were conspicuously bowed. His stay in London seemed to have influenced him the most, and since he had associated mainly with Englishmen in Valparaiso, his whole look was English somehow—and it suited him rather well. You could see it in the comfortable cut and durable wool of his suits, in the broad, solid style of his boots, and in the way his bushy reddish blond mustache drooped over his mouth, giving him a somewhat sour expression. His hands, with their round, clean, closely clipped nails, had turned the dull, porous white that hot climates can cause—and even they, for some inexplicable reason, looked English.","Christian had certainly not grown better looking. He was lean and pallid. The skin was stretched over his skull very tightly; his large nose, with a distinct hump, stuck out flesh-less and sharp between his cheek-bones, and his hair was al-ready noticeably scantier. His neck was too thin and long and his lean legs decidedly bowed. His London period seemed to have made a lasting impression upon him. In Valparaiso, too, he had mostly associated with Englishmen; and his whole appearance had something English about it which somehow seemed rather appropriate. It was partly the comfortable cut and durable wool material of his clothing, the broad, solid elegance of his boots, his crotchety expression, and the way in which his red-blond moustache drooped over his mouth. Even his hands had an English look: they were a dull porous white from the hot climate, with round, clean, short-trimmed nails."
"Eine weitere Folge dieses Sterbefalles war diejenige, daß des Konsuls Schwager Justus, sobald er den Rest seines Erbteiles in Händen hatte, müde seiner beständigen geschäftlichen Mißerfolge, liquidierte und sich zur Ruhe setzte. Justus Kröger, der Suitier, des à la mode-Kavaliers lebensfroher Sohn, war kein sehr glücklicher Mensch. Er hatte, mit seiner Kulanz und seiner heiteren Leichtlebigkeit, es niemals zu einer sicheren, soliden und zweifellosen Position in der Kaufmannswelt bringen können, er hatte einen bedeutenden Teil seines elterlichen Erbes im voraus eingebüßt, und neuerdings kam hinzu, daß Jakob, sein ältester Sohn, ihm schwere Kümmernisse bereitete.","Another consequence of this death was that the consul's brother-in-law Justus, tired of his constant business failures, liquidated and retired as soon as he had the remainder of his inheritance in his hands. Justus Kröger, the suitier, the cheerful son of the à la mode cavalier, was not a very happy man. With his courtesy and his cheerful easygoingness, he had never been able to achieve a secure, solid and unquestionable position in the merchant world; he had forfeited a significant part of his parental inheritance in advance, and recently there was the fact that Jakob, his eldest son , caused him severe grief.","A second result of her death was that the consul’s brother-in-law, Justus Kröger, who was weary of a long string of business setbacks, sold out and retired the moment he had his inheritance in hand. Justus Kröger, the debonair suitier, the son of the old cavalier à la mode, was not a very happy man. He was too easygoing, too generous of heart ever to attain a solid and undisputed position in the world of business; he had already spent a considerable portion of the money he had now inherited from his parents; and of late, his elder son, Jakob, was seriously adding to his worries.","The Consul's brother-in-law Justus, weary of continual busi-ness disappointments, as soon as he had his hands on his inheritance settled his business and retired.

"Christian erschien nicht oft zu den Andachten. Ein Einwand, den Thomas bei Gelegenheit ganz vorsichtig und halb im Scherze gegen die Übungen erhoben hatte, war mit Milde und Würde zurückgewiesen worden. Was Madame Grünlich anging, so benahm sie sich leider nicht immer völlig korrekt dabei.

"Was Deine geschäftlichen Zukunftspläne angeht, mein Sohn, so erfreuen sie mich durch das lebhafte Interesse, das sich in ihnen ausspricht, ohne zwar, daß ich ihnen vollkommen beizustimmen vermöchte. Du gehst von der Ansicht aus, daß der Absatz derjenigen Produkte, welche die Umgegend unserer Vaterstadt hervorbringe, als: Getreide, Rappsaat, Häute und Felle, Wolle, Öl, Ölkuchen, Knochen usw. das natürlichste, nachhaltigste Geschäft Deiner Vaterstadt sei und denkst Dich neben dem Kommissionshandel vorzugsweise jener Branche zuzuwenden. Ich habe mich zu einer Zeit, als die Konkurrenz in diesem Geschäftszweige noch sehr gering war (während sie jetzt erheblich gewachsen), gleichfalls mit diesem Gedanken beschäftigt und, soweit Raum und Gelegenheit dazu vorlagen, auch einige Experimente gemacht. Meine Reise nach England hatte hauptsächlich den Zweck, auch in diesem Lande Verbindungen für meine Unternehmungen nachzusuchen. Ich ging zu diesem Ende bis Schottland hinauf und machte manche nutzbringende Bekanntschaften, erkannte aber alsbald auch den gefährlichen Charakter, welchen die Exportgeschäfte dorthin an sich trugen, weshalb eine weitere Kultivierung derselben in der Folge auch unterblieb, zumal ich immer des Mahnwortes eingedenk gewesen bin, welches unser Vorfahr, der Gründer der Firma, uns hinterlassen: »Mein Sohn, sey mit Lust bey den Geschäften am Tage, aber mache nur solche, daß wir bey Nacht ruhig schlafen können!«","As to your business plans for the future, my son, I am delighted by the lively interest that is expressed in them, although I cannot fully agree with them. You are of the opinion that the sale of those products that the area around our home town produces, such as grain, rapeseed, hides and skins, wool, oil, oil cake, bones, etc., is the most natural, most sustainable business in your home town and you think so in addition to the commission trade, preferably turn to that branch. I have also occupied myself with this idea at a time when competition in this line of business was very slight (while it has now grown considerably) and, as far as there was space and opportunity, made some experiments. The main purpose of my trip to England was to look for contacts for my undertakings in this country as well. To this end I went up to Scotland and made some useful acquaintances, but soon recognized the dangerous character that the export business there carried in itself, which is why a further cultivation of the same was subsequently omitted, especially since I was always mindful of the admonition, which our ancestor, the founder of the company, bequeathed to us: ""My son, take pleasure in doing business during the day, but only do such that we can sleep peacefully at night!""","As to your future business plans, my son, I am greatly pleased by the lively interest they reveal, though I cannot fully concur in them. You proceed on the assumption that there is a natural and enduring market for the products native to our city’s environs, such as grain, rapeseed, hides and furs, wool, oil, linseed cake, bonemeal, etc., and you would particularly like to apply yourself to that trade, apart from our present consignment venture. At one time, when the competition in that trade was still relatively small (though in the meantime it has grown considerably), I also occupied myself with the same idea and, as time and opportunity permitted, made some experiments in that regard. The primary purpose of my trip to England was to investigate possible connections for such an enterprise. I even traveled as far as Scotland, making the acquaintance there of several people who have since proved valuable to the firm, but I soon recognized the precarious state of the export business there, with the result that I gave up any further cultivation of the idea, particularly because I have always kept in mind the admonition of our forefather and founder of our firm: “My son, show zeal for each day’s affairs of business, but only for such that make for a peaceful night’s sleep.”","As regards your business plans for the future, my son, I rejoice in the lively interest they indicate, without being able entirely to agree with them. You start with the idea that the market for our native products--for instance, grain, rape-seed, hides and skins, wool, oil, oil-cake, bones, etc.--is our chief concern; and you think it would be of advantage for you to turn yourself to the commission branch of the busi-ness. I once occupied myself with these ideas, at a time when the competition was small |it has since distinctly increased), and I made some experiments in 'them. My journey to Eng-land had for its chief purpose to look out connections there for my undertakings. To this end I went as far as Scotland, and made many valuable acquaintances; but I soon recognized the precarious nature of an export trade hither, and decided to discourage further expansion in that direction. Thus I kept in mind the warning of our fore-father, the founder of the firm, which he bequeathed to us, his descendants: ""My son, attend with zeal to thy business by day, but do none that hinders thee from thy sleep at night."""

"Senator Buddenbrook, der hie und da, wenn er das Kinderzimmer passierte, die Freunde beisammen sah, hatte gegen diesen Verkehr nichts einzuwenden, denn es war leicht zu beobachten, daß die beiden einander vorteilhaft beeinflußten.

He marveled at the whiteness of his hands, and, just to please Hanno, he even let Fräulein Jungmann take a brush and soap to his own.

"Es war klar, warum er erschienen war. Herr Modersohn sollte vor ihm eine Probe seiner Unterrichtskunst ablegen, sollte zeigen, was die Real-Untersekunda in sechs oder sieben Stunden bei ihm gelernt hatte; es galt Herrn Modersohns Existenz und Zukunft. Der Kandidat bot einen traurigen Anblick, als er wieder auf dem Katheder stand und jemanden zur Wiederholung des Gedichtes »The monkey« aufrief. Und wie bislang nur die Schüler geprüft und begutachtet worden waren, so geschah es nun gleichzeitig auch mit dem Lehrer … Ach, es erging beiden Teilen schlecht! Das Erscheinen Direktor Wulickes war eine Überrumpelung, und niemand, bis auf zwei oder drei, war vorbereitet. Herr Modersohn konnte unmöglich die ganze Stunde lang Adolf Todtenhaupt fragen, der alles wußte. Da »The monkey« in Gegenwart des Direktors nicht mehr abgelesen werden konnte, so ging es jammervoll, und als die Lektüre von »Ivanhoe« an die Reihe kam, konnte eigentlich nur der junge Graf Mölln ein wenig übersetzen, weil bei ihm ein privates Interesse für den Roman vorhanden war. Die übrigen stocherten hustend und hilflos zwischen den Vokabeln umher. Auch Hanno Buddenbrook ward aufgerufen und kam nicht über eine Zeile hinweg. Direktor Wulicke stieß einen Laut aus, wie wenn die tiefste Saite des Kontrabasses heftig angestrichen wird. Herr Modersohn rang seine kleinen, ungeschickten, mit Tinte besudelten Hände und wiederholte jammernd: »Und sonst ging es immer so gut! Und sonst ging es immer so gut!«","It was clear why he had appeared. Mr. Modersohn was supposed to put his teaching skills to the test in front of him, was supposed to show what the junior high school student had learned from him in six or seven hours; it was about Mr. Modersohn's existence and future. The contestant was a sad sight as he stood back on the lectern and called for a repeat of the poem 'The monkey'. And just as until now only the students had been examined and appraised, so it happened to the teacher at the same time... Oh, both parts fared badly! Director Wulicke's appearance was a surprise, and no one but two or three were prepared. It was impossible for Herr Modersohn to spend the whole hour questioning Adolf Todtenhaupt, who knew everything. Since ""The monkey"" could no longer be read in the director's presence, things went miserably, and when it was the turn of ""Ivanhoe"" to be read, only young Count Mölln could actually translate a little, because it was a personal interest for him was available for the novel. The others poked around helplessly and coughing among the vocabulary. Hanno Buddenbrook was also called up and couldn't get past a line. Director Wulicke let out a sound, as if the lowest string of the double bass was being struck violently. Herr Modersohn wrung his small, clumsy, ink-stained hands and wailed again: ""And otherwise it always went so well! And otherwise it always went so well!«","It was obvious what had happened. Herr Modersohn was supposed to demonstrate his teaching style, present a model lesson, and show what his sophomores had learned in six or seven hours under his instruction. This would decide Herr Modersohn’s future, his very existence. He was a sad sight to behold as he stood there beside his platform, and now he called upon someone to recite “The Monkey.” So far today it had been only the students who were tested and evaluated, but now the teacher would be examined right along with them. Oh, and things went badly for both parties. Director Wulicke’s sudden appearance was a surprise attack, and except for two or three students, no one was prepared. Herr Modersohn could not possibly ask Adolf Todtenhaupt, who knew everything, to recite for a whole hour. And since they could not read “The Monkey” directly from their books with the director present, the recitation was a fiasco; and when they moved on to Ivanhoe, only young Count Mölln could translate a little of it, because he actually had some interest in the novel. The rest of them coughed and stammered and poked ineptly at the words. Hanno Buddenbrook was called on as well and could not get beyond the first line. Director Wulicke roared a sound that sounded like someone scraping violently at the deepest note on a contrabass. Herr Modersohn wrung his little, clumsy, ink-stained hands and kept wailing, “ And it’s always gone so well. It’s always gone so well before.”","The reason for his coming was clear, Herr Modersohn was to give evidence of his ability to teach, to show what the lower second had learned in the six or seven hours he had been with them. It was a question of Herr Modersohn's existence and future. The Candidate was a sorry figure as he stood on the platform and called again on somebody to recite ""The Mon-key. "" Up to now it had been only the pupils who were ex-amined, but now it was the master as well. Alas, it went badly on both sides! Herr Director Wulicke's appearance was entirely unexpected, and only two or three of the pupils were prepared. It was impossible for Herr Modersohn to call up Adolf Todtenhaupt for the whole hour on end; after ""The Monkey"" had been recited once, it could not be asked for again, and so things were in a bad way. When the reading from Ivanhoe began, young Count Mblln was the only person who could translate it at all, he having a personal interest in the novel. The others hemmed and hawed, stuttered, and got hopelessly stuck. Hanno Buddenbrook was called up and could not do a line. Director Wulicke gave utterance to a sound that was as though the lowest string of his double-bass had been violently plucked, and Herr Modersohn wrung his small, clumsy, inky hands repeating plaintively over and over. "" And it went so well--it always went so well!"""

"Im übrigen gingen, wie sich versteht, die Bestimmungen dahin, daß alles nach Möglichkeit beisammengelassen werden sollte, daß Frau Elisabeth Buddenbrook im Prinzip Universalerbin sei und das ganze Vermögen im Geschäfte verbleibe, wobei Herr Marcus konstatierte, daß er das Betriebskapital als Teilhaber um 120000 Kurant verstärke. Für Thomas waren als vorläufiges Privatvermögen 50000 ausgesetzt und die gleiche Summe für Christian, in dem Falle, daß er sich selbständig etabliere.

Justus Kröger was busy when the passage was read out: ""I leave the fixing of the dowry amount for my dearly beloved younger daughter Klara in the event of her marriage to the discretion of my dearly beloved wife"" ... ""Let's say 100,000!"" he suggested by saying leaning back, crossing his legs and using both hands to twist up his short gray mustache. He was goodwill itself. But the customary sum of 80,000 Kurantmarks was fixed.","On the whole, as was to be expected, the will’s provisions were aimed at keeping the estate together as best as possible, making Frau Elisabeth Buddenbrook virtually the universal heir and retaining all assets within the business—in which regard, Herr Marcus gave notice that as a partner he would be strengthening the firm’s capital by 120,000 courant. Thomas’s private fortune was tentatively set at 50,000, and an equal sum was put aside for Christian, should he at some point establish himself independently. Justus Kröger was all ears when the following clause was read: “The fixing of the sum to be applied as a dowry for my dearly beloved younger daughter, Clara, in the event of her marriage is left to the judgment of my dearly beloved wife.” “Let’s say 100,000,” he suggested, leaning back, crossing his legs, and using both hands to turn up the ends of his short mustache. He was fairness personified. But they decided on the traditional sum of 80,000 marks courant.","Herr Marcus announced that as partner he should be able to strengthen the working capital by a hundred and twenty thousand marks current. A sum of fifty thousand marks was set aside as a private fDTtune for Thomas, and the same for Christian, in case he wished to establish himself separately.

"Madame Grünlich lachte so ziemlich allein in der kleinen Tafelrunde; aber Christian fuhr mit umherwandernden Augen zu sprechen fort. Er sprach von englischen Kaffee-Konzertsängerinnen, er erzählte von einer Dame, die mit einer gepuderten Perücke aufgetreten sei, mit einem langen Stock auf die Erde gestoßen und ein Lied namens »That's Maria«! gesungen habe … »Maria, wißt ihr, Maria ist die Schändlichste von allen … Wenn eine das Sündhafteste begangen hat: that's Maria! Maria ist die Allerschlimmste, wißt ihr … das Laster …« Und das letzte Wort sprach er mit abscheulichem Ausdruck, indem er die Nase krauste und die rechte Hand mit gekrümmten Fingern erhob.","Madame Grünlich laughed pretty much alone at the small table; but Christian went on talking with wandering eyes. He spoke of English coffee-concert singers, he told of a lady who appeared in a powdered wig, hit the ground with a long stick and a song called ""That's Maria""! sang... »Maria, you know, Maria is the most shameful of all... If one has committed the most sinful thing: that's Maria! Maria is the worst of all, you know… the vice…” And he said the last word with a hideous expression, wrinkling his nose and raising his right hand with crooked fingers.","Madame Grünlich was more or less the only person at the table to laugh; but Christian went right on talking, his eyes wandering here and there. He talked about English café-concert singers, told them about a woman in a powdered wig who banged the floor with a long staff and sang a song titled “That’s Maria!” “Because Maria, you see, Maria’s a scandalous girl, the worst of ’em all. If somebody’s done something naughty, that’s Maria. Maria’s the worst of the lot, you see, Maria’s simply depraved.” And he spoke the final word in a dreadful voice, wrinkling up his nose and raising his right hand with his fingers cramped in horror.","Madame Gr�nlich was the only one who laughed, to speak of, in the circle round the table. But Christian went on, his eyes wandering back and forth.

"Als Kind – mein Gott, wie winzig mußte sie als Kind gewesen sein! – hatte Therese Weichbrodt sich selber »Sesemi« genannt, und diese Änderung ihres Vornamens hatte sie beibehalten, indem sie den besseren und tüchtigeren Schülerinnen, Internen sowohl wie Externen, gestattete, sie so zu nennen. »Nenne mich ›Sesemi‹, Kind«, sagte sie gleich am ersten Tage zu Tony Buddenbrook, indem sie sie kurz und mit einem leicht knallenden Geräusch auf die Stirn küßte … »Ich höre es gern.« Ihre ältere Schwester Madame Kethelsen aber hieß Nelly.","As a child - my God, how tiny she must have been as a child! – Therese Weichbrodt had called herself “Sesemi”, and she had kept this change in her first name, allowing the better and more capable students, internal as well as external, to call her that.

"Ein stiller, strafender Seitenblick traf ihn aus den Augen der Konsulin. Er erwiderte ihn mit unbefangener und verständnislos fragender Miene. – Um neun Uhr ging man zu Tische.","A quiet, punishing sidelong glance met him from the Consul's eyes. He answered it with an impartial and uncomprehending questioning face. - At nine o'clock we went to table.","His mother cast him a silent, reproachful glance.

"»Papperlapapp, Buddenbrook!« sagte er mit sonderbarer Müdigkeit. »Ich bin ennuyiert, das ist das Ganze.« Aber er strafte sich selber Lügen, indem er plötzlich hervorzischte: »Parbleu, Jean! man müßte diesen infamen Schmierfinken den Respekt mit Pulver und Blei in den Leib knallen … Das Pack …!

"Der Konsul sah ihn blinzelnd an, indem er ihn weder sah noch hörte. Er hatte keineswegs seinem wirklichen Gedanken Ausdruck gegeben, über den er grübelte … Warum, fragte er sich argwöhnisch und dennoch verständnislos, warum dies alles gerade jetzt? B. Grünlich hätte schon vor zwei, vor drei Jahren stehen können, wo er jetzt stand; das übersah man mit einem Blick. Aber sein Kredit war unerschöpflich gewesen, er hatte von den Banken Kapital erhalten, er hatte die Unterschriften von soliden Häusern wie Senator Bock und Konsul Goudstikker immer wieder für seine Unternehmungen in Empfang genommen, und seine Wechsel hatten kursiert wie Bargeld. Warum gerade jetzt, jetzt, jetzt – und der Chef der Firma Johann Buddenbrook wußte wohl, was er unter diesem Jetzt verstand – dieser Zusammenbruch auf allen Seiten, dieses totale Zurückziehen alles Vertrauens wie auf Verabredung, dieses einmütige Herfallen über B. Grünlich unter Hintansetzung jeder Rücksicht, ja jeder Höflichkeitsform? Der Konsul wäre allzu naiv gewesen, hätte er nicht gewußt, daß das Ansehen seines eignen Hauses nach der Verlobung Grünlichs mit seiner Tochter auch seinem Schwiegersohne hatte zugute kommen müssen. Aber hatte der Kredit des Letzteren so vollkommen, so eklatant, so ausschließlich von dem seinen abgehangen? War Grünlich selbst denn nichts gewesen? Und die Erkundigungen, die der Konsul eingezogen, die Bücher, die er geprüft hatte?… Mochte es sich damit verhalten, wie es wollte, so stand sein Entschluß, in dieser Sache auch nicht das Glied eines Fingers zu regen, fester als jemals. Man sollte sich verrechnet haben! Augenscheinlich hatte B. Grünlich die Anschauung zu erwecken gewußt, als sei er mit Johann Buddenbrook solidarisch? Diesem, wie es schien, entsetzlich weit verbreiteten Irrtum mußte ein für alle Male vorgebeugt werden! Und auch dieser Kesselmeyer sollte sich wundern! Besaß dieser Bajazz ein Gewissen? Es sprang in die Augen, wie schamlos er ganz allein darauf spekuliert hatte, daß er, Johann Buddenbrook, den Mann seiner Tochter nicht würde fallen lassen, wie er dem längst vernichteten Grünlich zwar fort und fort Kredit gewährt, ihn aber immer blutigere Wucherzinsen hatte unterschreiben lassen …","The Consul blinked at him, neither seeing nor hearing him. He had by no means expressed the real thought he was mulling over... Why, he wondered suspiciously yet uncomprehendingly, why all this now? B. Grünlich could have been where he is now two or three years ago; you could see that at a glance. But his credit had been inexhaustible, he had received capital from the banks, he had repeatedly received the signatures of solid houses like Senator Bock and Consul Goudstikker for his ventures, and his bills of exchange had circulated like cash. Why now, now, now - and the head of the firm, Johann Buddenbrook, knew very well what he meant by this now - this collapse on all sides, this total withdrawal of all trust as if by agreement, this unanimous attack on B. Grünlich, putting everyone down Consideration, yes every form of politeness? The Consul would have been far too naive if he had not known that the prestige of his own house after Grünlich's engagement to his daughter must have benefited his son-in-law as well. But had the latter's credit depended so completely, so blatantly, so exclusively on his? Was Grünlich himself nothing? And the inquiries made by the consul, the books he had examined?... Whatever happened, his resolution not to lift a finger in the matter stood firmer than ever. You should have miscalculated! Apparently B. Grünlich had managed to create the impression that he was in solidarity with Johann Buddenbrook? This, it seemed, terribly widespread misconception had to be prevented once and for all! And this Kesselmeyer should also be surprised! Did this Bajazz have a conscience? It was obvious how shamelessly he had speculated, all alone, that he, Johann Buddenbrook, would not let his daughter's husband fall, just as he had given the long-dead Grünlich credit on and on, but had signed him with increasingly bloody extortionate interest leave …","The consul stared at him, blinking—but he neither saw nor heard him. He had told them nothing of the real thoughts gnawing away inside him. Bewildered and suspicious, he asked himself why, why had all this happened just now? B. Grünlich’s present misfortune could just as easily have overcome him two or three years before—that was evident at first glance. But he had enjoyed inexhaustible credit: banks had provided him with capital, again and again he had received the endorsements of solid firms like those of Senator Bock and Consul Goudstikker, his promissory notes had been treated as if they were cash. And then had come a collapse on all sides, a total withdrawal of trust as if by prearrangement, everyone joining in the attack on B. Grünlich with complete and ruthless disregard for even common business courtesy. But why now, now, now?—And the head of the firm of Johann Buddenbrook knew quite well what he meant by “now.” He would have been very naïve not to have known that the reputation of his own firm necessarily enhanced his son-in-law’s prospects, once the engagement to Antonie was announced. But had Grünlich’s credit really depended so completely, so blatantly, so exclusively on his own? Had Grünlich in fact been a nobody? But what about the inquiries the consul had made , the books he had examined? However matters stood, he was firmer than ever in his resolve not to lift a finger to help. It seemed they were all sadly mistaken. So B. Grünlich had known how to create the illusion that Johann Buddenbrook stood behind him, had he? That was a dreadful misconception, and apparently widely held, and he would have to put a stop to it once and for all. And this Kesselmeyer was in for a surprise, too. Did that buffoon have no conscience at all? It was plain as day from the way he had kept extending more and more credit to Grünlich—long after he had become insolvent and at ever more bloodthirsty rates of interest—that he had shamelessly speculated on the probability that he, Johann Buddenbrook, would not let his daughter’s husband be ruined.","The Consul stared at him, but without either seeing or hearing him. He himself had not expressed his own actual thoughts, his real misgivings. Why, he asked himself with puzzled suspicion, why was this happening now? It was as clear as daylight that, just where he stood to-day, B. Grunlich had stood two years, three years before. But his credit had been inexhaust-ible, he had had capital from the banks, and for his undertakings continual endorsement from sound houses like Senator Bock and Consul Goudstikker. His paper had passed as current as banknotes. Why now, precisely now--and the head of the firm of Johann Buddenbrook knew well what he meant by this ""now""--had there come this crash on all sides, this complete withdrawal of credit as if by common consent, this unanimous descent upon B. Gr�nlich, this disregard of all consideration, all ordinary business courtesy? The Consul would have been nai've indeed had he not realized that the good standing of his own firm was to the advantage of his son-in-law. But had the son-in-law's credit so entirely, so strikingly, so exclusively depended upon his own? Had Criinlich himself been nothing at all? And the information the Consul had had, the books he had examined--? Well, however the thing stood, his resolution was firmer than ever not to lift a finger. They had reckoned without their host. Apparently B. Gr�nlich had known how to make it appear that he was connected with the firm of Buddenbrook-- well, this widely-circulated ertor should be set right once for all. And this Kesselmeyer--he was going to get a shock too. The clown! Had he no conscience whatever? It was very plain how shamelessly he had speculated on the probability that he, Johann Buddenbrook, would not let his daughter's husband be ruined; how he had continued to finance Gr�nlich long after he was unsound, and exacted from him an ever crueller rate of interest."
"Sie war vonnöten; denn immer wieder galt es, mit einem belebenden und ablenkenden Worte eine Stille zu verscheuchen, die sich an der Familientafel im Eßsaale ausbreitete, wenn etwa der Direktor sich in allzu neckischer Art mit Erikas Wangen und Armen beschäftigte, wenn er sich gesprächsweise erkundigte, ob Orangemarmelade eine Mehlspeise sei, – »Mehlschpeis'« sagte er mit kecker Betonung – oder wenn er der Meinung Ausdruck gab, »Romeo und Julia« sei ein Stück von Schiller … Dinge, die er unter sorglosem Händereiben, den Oberkörper schräg gegen die Stuhllehne zurückgeworfen, mit vieler Frische und Festigkeit hervorbrachte.","She was needed; because again and again it was necessary to banish the silence that was spreading at the family table in the dining room with an invigorating and distracting word, for example when the director was too teasingly busy with Erika's cheeks and arms, when he asked in conversation whether orange marmalade was available was a pastry—""Flourish pudding,"" he said with bold emphasis—or when he expressed the opinion that ""Romeo and Juliet"" was a piece by Schiller... things he rubbed his hands carelessly, his upper body thrown back at an angle against the back of the chair, with much freshness and firmness.","And tolerance was needed. For instance, when the family was gathered around the dining-room table, someone would have to make a light, diverting comment to break the silence because the director was all too busy dallying with Erika’s cheeks or arms, or because he had asked whether orange marmalade was some kind of pudding—he said “puddin’,” with a perky stress on the first syllable—or because he ventured the opinion that Romeo and Juliet was a play by Schiller. He would offer such comments with self-assured vigor, while nonchalantly rubbing his hands and leaning back to one side against the arm of his chair.","And tact was needed. For pauses would come at the family table/ when Director Weinschenk tried to make conversation by asking if ""orange marmalade"" was a ""pudden""; when he gave out the opinion that Romeo and Juliet was a piece by Schiller; when his manner with Erica's cheek or arm became loo roguish. He uttered his views frankly and cheerfully, Tubbing his hands like a man whose mind is free from care, and leaning back sidewise against the arm of his chair. Some one always needed to fill in the pause by a sprightly or diverting remark."
Herr Grünlich rückte sichtlich nervös auf seinem Stuhl hin und her. Abwechselnd fuhr er mit seinem langen Zeigefinger zwischen Kragen und Hals und ließ hastig seine goldgelben Favoris durch die Hände gleiten …,"Herr Grünlich shifted back and forth in his chair, visibly nervous. He alternately ran his long index finger between his collar and his neck and hastily let his golden yellow favorites slide through his hands...",Herr Grünlich fidgeted nervously back and forth in his chair.

"Und endlich war doch das Ende gekommen. Das singende, schimmernde Glück war verstummt und erloschen, mit fiebrigem Kopfe hatte er sich daheim in seinem Zimmer wiedergefunden und war gewahr worden, daß nur ein paar Stunden des Schlafes dort in seinem Bett ihn von grauem Alltag trennten. Da hatte ihn ein Anfall jener gänzlichen Verzagtheit überwältigt, die er so wohl kannte. Er hatte wieder empfunden, wie wehe die Schönheit tut, wie tief sie in Scham und sehnsüchtige Verzweiflung stürzt und doch auch den Mut und die Tauglichkeit zum gemeinen Leben verzehrt. So fürchterlich hoffnungslos und bergeschwer hatte es ihn niedergedrückt, daß er sich wieder einmal gesagt hatte, es müsse mehr sein als seine persönlichen Kümmernisse, was auf ihm laste, eine Bürde, die von Anbeginn seine Seele beschwert habe und sie irgendwann einmal ersticken müsse …","And finally the end had come. The singing, shimmering happiness had fallen silent and gone, he had found himself at home in his room with a fever in his head and had realized that only a few hours of sleep there in his bed separated him from the gray everyday life. Then a fit of that utter despondency that he knew so well had overwhelmed him. He had felt again how painful beauty hurts, how deeply it plunges into shame and yearning despair and yet also saps courage and fitness for common life. It had weighed him down so terribly hopelessly and so heavily that he had told himself once again that it must be something more than his personal worries that weighed on him, a burden that had weighed down his soul from the beginning and must one day suffocate it . . .","It had come to an end all the same. The lilting, shimmering delight had faded and died, and he had found himself back home, in his room, with a feverish head and the awareness that only a few hours of sleep here in his bed separated him from the dreary everyday world. And he had been overwhelmed by one of those fits of total despondency that he knew so well. He had once again felt how painful beauty truly is, how it plunged you into shame and yearning despair and at the same time gnawed away at your courage and fitness for daily life. He had felt it as a dreadful, gloomy mountain pressing down on him so heavily that once again he was forced to admit that something more than private grief must be weighing him down, that some burden must have oppressed his soul from the very beginning and would suffocate him one day.","The end had come at length. The singing, shimmering joy was quenched and silent. He had found himself back home in his room, with a burning head and the consciousness that only a few hours of sleep, there in his bed, separated him from dull everyday existence. And he had been overpowered by an attack of the complete despondency which was all too familiar an experience. Again he had learned that beauty can pierce one like a pain, and that it can sink profoundly into shame and a longing despair that utterly consume the courage and energy necessary to the life of every day. His despondency weighed him down like mountains, and once more he told himself, as he had done before, that this was more than his own individual burden of weaknesses that rested upon him: that his burden was one which he had borne upon 305 his soul from the beginning of time, and must one day sink under at last."

Their bright, pure treble, borne above the lower voices, soared in praise and rejoicing and lifted every heart, softened the smiles of the spinsters, inspired the old folks to look within and review their lives, and allowed those who still stood in the middle of life to forget their troubles for a while.","""Rejoice, O Daughter of Zion!"" sang the choir-boys. Thry had previously been indulging in such audible practical jokes that the Senator had to get up and stand in the door-way to inspire respect. But now they sang beautifully.

"War aber der Senator im Fortwirken für das alte Firmenschild, dem er ehemals mit soviel Enthusiasmus gedient hatte, durch erlittenes Mißgeschick und innere Mattigkeit gelähmt, so waren seinem Emporstreben im städtischen Gemeinwesen äußere Grenzen gezogen, die unüberschreitbar waren. Seit Jahren, schon seit seiner Berufung in den Senat, hatte er auch hier erlangt, was für ihn zu erlangen war. Es gab nur noch Stellungen innezuhalten und Ämter zu bekleiden, aber nichts mehr zu erobern; es gab nur noch Gegenwart und kleinliche Wirklichkeit, aber keine Zukunft und keine ehrgeizigen Pläne mehr. Zwar hatte er seine Macht in der Stadt umfänglicher zu gestalten gewußt, als ein anderer an seiner Stelle das vermocht hätte, und seinen Feinden wurde es schwer, zu leugnen, daß er »des Bürgermeisters rechte Hand« sei. Bürgermeister aber konnte Thomas Buddenbrook nicht werden, denn er war Kaufmann und nicht Gelehrter, er hatte kein Gymnasium absolviert, war nicht Jurist und überhaupt nicht akademisch ausgebildet. Er aber, der von jeher seine Mußestunden mit historischer und literarischer Lektüre ausgefüllt hatte, der sich seiner gesamten Umgebung an Geist, Verstand und innerer wie äußerer Bildung überlegen fühlte, er verwand nicht den Ärger darüber, daß das Fehlen der ordnungsmäßigen Qualifikationen es ihm unmöglich machte, in dem kleinen Reich, in das er hineingeboren, die erste Stelle einzunehmen. »Wie dumm sind wir gewesen«, sagte er zu seinem Freunde und Bewunderer Stephan Kistenmaker – aber mit dem »wir« meinte er nur sich allein –, »daß wir so früh ins Kontor gelaufen sind und nicht lieber die Schule beendigt haben!« Und Stephan Kistenmaker antwortete: »Ja, da hast du wahrhaftig recht!… Warum übrigens?«","But if the senator was paralyzed by misfortune and inner weariness in continuing to work for the old name of the company, which he had formerly served with so much enthusiasm, his aspirations in the urban community were subject to external limits that could not be crossed. For years, ever since his appointment to the Senate, he had gotten what he could get here, too. There were only positions to hold and offices to hold, but nothing more to conquer; there was only the present and petty reality, but no future and no more ambitious plans. It is true that he had been able to use his power in the city more extensively than anyone else could have done in his place, and it was difficult for his enemies to deny that he was ""the mayor's right hand man."" However, Thomas Buddenbrook could not become mayor because he was a businessman and not a scholar, he had not graduated from high school, was not a lawyer and had no academic training at all. But he, who had always filled his leisure hours with historical and literary reading, who felt that he was superior to everyone around him in spirit, understanding and inner as well as outer education, he could not get over his anger that the lack of the proper qualifications made it impossible for him , to take the first place in the little kingdom into which he was born. ""How stupid we were,"" he said to his friend and admirer Stephan Kistenmaker - but when he said ""we"" he only meant himself - ""that we went to the office so early and didn't want to finish school!"" And Stephan Kistenmaker answered: ""Yes, you are absolutely right!... Why, by the way?""","And just as the senator’s former enthusiasm and effectiveness in serving the old firm had been lamed by misfortune and his own inner exhaustion, so, too, his aspirations in community affairs had been thwarted by the limits of external circumstance. Years ago now—indeed, perhaps on the very day he was first voted into the senate—he had accomplished whatever could be accomplished. There were the various offices and honorary posts to which he was appointed, but no new realms left to conquer. There was the present and its petty reality, but no future ahead, no field for ambitious plans. Granted, he had known how to expand the scope of his power in local politics better than others in the same position might have done, and it was difficult for his foes to deny that he was “the mayor’s right hand.” But Thomas Buddenbrook would never be mayor himself, because he was a merchant and not a professional man—he hadn’t even completed high school, wasn’t a lawyer, had never pursued any academic degree. Because he had occupied his leisure time with reading works of literature and history, he had always felt that, compared with those around him, he was superior in intelligence, common sense, personal development, and cultural refinement; and so he could not get over his annoyance that his lack of conventional qualifications made it impossible for him to achieve the highest position available in the little world into which he had been born. “We were so stupid,” he told his friend and admirer Stephan Kistenmaker—although by “we” he really meant only himself—“to have run off to work in an office so soon, instead of finishing school.” And Stephan Kistenmaker replied, “Yes, you’re absolutely right. But how do you mean?”","Thus the Senator's services to the old firm were no longer what theyhad been in the time of his strength and enthusiasm^ while his labours for the good of the community had at the same time reached a point where they were circumscribed by limitations from without. When he was elected to the Senate, in fact, he had reached those limitations. There were thereafter only places to keep, offices to hold, but nothing further that he could achieve: nothing; but the present, the! narrow reality; never any grandiose plans to be carried out] in thefuture. He had, indeed, known how to make his position and his power mean more than others had made them mean in his place: even his enemies did not deny that he was ""the Burgomaster's right hand."" But Burgomaster himself Thomas Buddenbrook could never become. He war a merchant, not a professional man; he had not taken the classical course at the gymnasium, he was -not a lawyer. He had always done a great deal of historical and literary reading in his spare time, and he was conscious of being superior to his circle in mind and understanding, in inward as well as outward culture; so he did not waste much time in lamenting the lack of external qualifications which made it impossible for him to succeed to the first place in his little community. "" How foolish we were,"" he said to Stephan Kistenmaker--but he really only meant himself by ""we""--""that we went into the office so young, and did not finish our schooling instead."" And Stephan Kistenmaker answered: ""You're right there. But how do you mean?"""

"Diese kleinen Morgengespräche mit dem aufgeweckten Barbier bildeten die Einleitung zu den lebhaftesten und tätigsten Tagen, über und über ausgefüllt mit Denken, Reden, Handeln, Schreiben, Berechnen, Hin- und Widergehen … Dank seinen Reisen, seinen Kenntnissen, seinen Interessen war Thomas Buddenbrook in seiner Umgebung der am wenigsten bürgerlich beschränkte Kopf, und sicherlich war er der erste, die Enge und Kleinheit der Verhältnisse zu empfinden, in denen er sich bewegte. Aber draußen in seinem weiteren Vaterlande war auf den Aufschwung des öffentlichen Lebens, den die Revolutionsjahre gebracht hatten, eine Periode der Erschlaffung, des Stillstandes und der Umkehr gefolgt, zu öde, um einen lebendigen Sinn zu beschäftigen, und so besaß er denn Geist genug, um den Spruch von der bloß symbolischen Bedeutung alles menschlichen Tuns zu seiner Lieblingswahrheit zu machen und alles, was an Wollen, Können, Enthusiasmus und aktivem Schwung sein eigen war, in den Dienst des kleinen Gemeinwesens zu stellen, in dessen Bezirk sein Name zu den ersten gehörte – sowie in den Dienst dieses Namens und des Firmenschildes, das er ererbt … Geist genug, seinen Ehrgeiz, es im kleinen zu Größe und Macht zu bringen, gleichzeitig zu belächeln und ernst zu nehmen.","These little morning talks with the bright barber formed the introduction to the liveliest and most active days, filled to the brim with thinking, talking, acting, writing, calculating, going back and forth... Thanks to his travels, his knowledge, his interests, Thomas Buddenbrook was in The head with the least bourgeois limitations in those around him, and he was certainly the first to feel the narrowness and smallness of the circumstances in which he moved. But outside in his wider fatherland, the upsurge in public life that the years of revolution had brought was followed by a period of slackness, standstill and reversal, too desolate to employ any living mind, and so he possessed the intellect enough to make the dictum of the merely symbolic meaning of all human activity his favorite truth and to put everything that was his own in terms of will, ability, enthusiasm and active drive into the service of the small community in whose district his name was among the first belonged – as well as in the service of this name and the company sign that he inherited … spirit enough to smile at the same time and take seriously his ambition to achieve greatness and power on a small scale.","These little morning conversations with the astute barber acted as the prelude to busy, active days, filled to overflowing with thinking, speaking, dealing, writing, calculating, moving here and there about town. As a result of his travels, his knowledge, and his interests, Thomas Buddenbrook had the least provincial mind of any of the men around him, and he was certainly the first to realize the limits of the world in which he moved. But out in the broad expanses of his Fatherland, the renewal in public affairs that had accompanied the years of revolution had given way to a period of lethargy, stagnation, and regression much too dreary to occupy a lively mind. Thomas, however, had imagination enough to adopt as his personal precept the old maxim that all human endeavor is merely symbolic, and to place all his aspirations, abilities, enthusiasm, and active energies both at the service of this small community, where the name Buddenbrook placed him in the first ranks, and at the service of that name and the family firm he had inherited—indeed, he had imagination enough to take seriously his ambition of attaining greatness and power in this small sphere and at the same time to smile at himself for being so ambitious.","These little morning sessions with the lively barber formed the introduction to busy days, full to running over with thinking, talking, writing, reckoning, doing business, going about in the town. Thanks to his travel, his interests, and his knowledge of affairs, Thomas Buddenbrook's mind was the least provincial in the distrirt; and he was certainly the first to realize the limitations of his lot. The lively interest in public affairs which the years of the Revolution had brought in, was suffering throughout the whole country from a period of prostration and arrest, and that field was too sterile to oc-cupy a vigorous talent; but Thomas Buddenbrook possessed the spirit to take to himself that wise old saying that all hu-man achievement is of a merely symbolic value, and thus to devote all that he had of capacity, enthusiasm, energy, and strength of will to the service of the community as well as to the service of his own name and firm."

What a lovely garden,' he interrupted himself while gratefully helping himself to a cigar from the Consul, 'but, for a city garden it's unusually large! And what a colorful array of flowers... oh my god, I confess my weakness for flowers and for nature in general! Those corn roses over there are really preening…”","The consul’s wife mentioned the dreadful days Herr Grünlich’s hometown had experienced in May of ’42. “Dreadful indeed,” Herr Grünlich responded, “the fire was a terrible calamity, a heartbreaking ordeal. Damages of 135 million, and the figures are a rather precise calculation. Though, for my part, I can only express my deepest gratitude to Providence that I was not inconvenienced in the least. The principal conflagration was in the parishes of St. Peter and St. Nicholas. … What an enchanting garden,” he said, interrupting himself, while thanking the consul for an offered cigar, “and so uncommonly large for a garden in town. And what a burst of floral color. Oh, gracious, I must admit my weakness for flowers and nature in general. Those poppies there add a rare, ornamental touch.”","The Frau Consul mentioned the disastrous fire which had swept Hamburg in May of the year 1842. "" Yes, indeed,"" said Herr Gr�nlich, ""truly a fearful misfortune, A dis-tressing visitation. The loss amounted to one hundred and thirty-five millions, at a rough estimate. I am grateful to Providence that I came off without any loss whatever. The fire raged chiefly in the parishes of St. Peter and St. Nicholas.--What a charming garden!"" he interrupted himself, taking the cigar which the Consul offered. ""It is so large for a town garden, and the beds of colour are magnificent. I confess my weakness for flowers, and for nature in general. Those climbing roses over there trim up the garden uncommonly well."
"Etwas verspätet, denn die junge Konsulin Buddenbrook war nicht gewohnt, so früh ihre Toilette zu beenden, traf der Konsul mit seiner Gattin ein. Er sah gut und munter aus in seinem hellbraunen, kleinkarierten Anzug, dessen breite Reverse den Rand der Sommerweste sehen ließen, und seine Augen lächelten, als er Tonys unvergleichlich würdevolle Miene gewahrte. Aber Gerda, deren ein wenig morbide und rätselhafte Schönheit einen seltsamen Gegensatz zu der hübschen Gesundheit ihrer Schwägerin bildete, zeigte durchaus keine Sonntags- und Ausflugsstimmung. Wahrscheinlich hatte sie nicht ausgeschlafen. Das satte Lila, das die Grundfarbe ihrer Robe ausmachte und in höchst eigenartiger Weise mit dem Dunkelrot ihres schweren Haares zusammenklang, ließ ihren Teint noch weißer, noch matter erscheinen; tiefer und dunkler als sonst lagerten in den Winkeln ihrer nahe beieinander liegenden braunen Augen bläuliche Schatten … Kalt bot sie ihrer Schwiegermutter die Stirn zum Kusse, reichte Herrn Permaneder mit ziemlich ironischem Ausdruck die Hand, und als Frau Grünlich bei ihrem Anblick die Hände zusammenschlug und mit lauter Stimme ausrief: »Gerda, o Gott, wie schön bist du wieder –!« antwortete sie lediglich mit einem ablehnenden Lächeln.","A little late, because the young Consul Buddenbrook was not used to finishing her toilet so early, the Consul arrived with his wife. He looked lively and lively in his light brown checked suit, wide lapels showing the edge of his summer waistcoat, and his eyes smiled at Tony's incomparably dignified expression. But Gerda, whose somewhat morbid and enigmatic beauty formed a strange contrast to the pretty health of her sister-in-law, showed absolutely no mood for Sunday excursions. She probably hadn't slept well. The deep purple that was the basic color of her robe, which harmonized in a most peculiar way with the dark red of her heavy hair, made her complexion appear even whiter, even duller; Deeper and darker than usual, there were bluish shadows in the corners of her close-set brown eyes... Coldly, she offered her mother-in-law a kiss for her forehead, gave Herr Permaneder her hand with a rather ironic expression, and when Frau Grünlich clasped her hands at the sight of her and with exclaimed in a loud voice: ""Gerda, oh God, how beautiful you are again -!"" she merely replied with a dismissive smile.","The consul and his wife arrived a little late—Gerda was not accustomed to being up and ready so early in the day. Tom looked good in his tan, small-checked suit with broad lapels that revealed the edge of his summer vest; he was cheerful and a smile came into his eyes at the sight of Tony’s incomparable dignity. But, in curious contrast to her sister-in-law’s glowing prettiness, Gerda’s beauty was somehow unwholesome and enigmatic—and she was definitely not in the mood for a Sunday excursion. Presumably she had not had enough sleep. The rich lilac of her gown matched her heavy, dark chestnut hair in some very odd way and made her lusterless complexion look paler than ever; even the bluish shadows seemed deeper and darker in the corners of her close-set brown eyes. She coolly offered her mother-in-law her brow for a kiss, gave her hand to Herr Permaneder, but with a rather ironic look on her face, and, when Frau Grünlich clapped her hands and cried in a loud voice, “Gerda, oh, heavens, how lovely you do look! ,” she responded with only a dismissive smile.","He came with his wife, somewhat tardily, for the young Frau Consul was not used to make such an early toilette. He looked well and happy in his light-brown checked suit, the broad revers of which showed the white waistcoat be-neath; and his eyes had a smile in them as he noted Tony's incomparably dignified mien. Gerda, with her slightly exotic, even morbid beauty, which was always in great contrast to her sister-in-law's healthy prettiness, was not in a holiday mood. Probably she had risen too early. The deep lilac back-ground of her frock suited oddly with her dark-red hair and made her skin look whiter and more even-toned than ever, and the bluish shadows deeper and darker in the corners of her close-set brown eyes. She rather coldly offered her mother-in-law her brow to kiss, gave her hand to Herr Per-manedpr with an almost ironical expression on her face, and answered only by a deprecating smile when Tony clapped her hands and cried out in her hearty way: ""Dh, Gerda, how lovely you always look!"""

"Da das Trauerjahr der Buddenbrooks noch nicht abgelaufen war, so wurden die beiden Verlobungen nur in der Familie gefeiert; Gerda Arnoldsen aber war dennoch rasch genug berühmt in der Stadt, ja, ihre Person bildete den hauptsächlichen Gesprächsstoff an der Börse, im Klub, im Stadttheater, in Gesellschaft … »Tipptopp«, sagten die Suitiers und schnalzten mit der Zunge, denn das war der neueste hamburgische Ausdruck für etwas auserlesen Feines, handelte es sich nun um eine Rotweinmarke, um eine Zigarre, um ein Diner oder um geschäftliche Bonität. Aber unter den soliden, biederen und ehrenfesten Bürgern waren viele, die den Kopf schüttelten … »Sonderbar … diese Toiletten, dieses Haar, diese Haltung, dieses Gesicht … ein bißchen reichlich sonderbar.« Kaufmann Sörensen drückte es aus: »Sie hat ein bißchen was Gewisses …«, und dabei wand er sich und machte ein krauses Gesicht, wie wenn ihm an der Börse eine faule Offerte gemacht wurde. Aber es war Konsul Buddenbrook … es sah ihm ähnlich. Ein bißchen prätentiös, dieser Thomas Buddenbrook, ein bißchen … anders: anders auch als seine Vorfahren. Man wußte, besonders der Tuchhändler Benthien wußte es, daß er nicht nur seine sämtlichen feinen und neumodischen Kleidungsstücke – und er besaß deren ungewöhnlich viele: Pardessus, Röcke, Hüte, Westen, Beinkleider und Krawatten – ja auch seine Wäsche aus Hamburg bezog. Man wußte sogar, daß er tagtäglich, manchmal sogar zweimal am Tage, das Hemd wechselte und sich das Taschentuch und den à la Napoleon III. ausgezogenen Schnurrbart parfümierte. Und das alles tat er nicht der Firma und der Repräsentation zuliebe – das Haus »Johann Buddenbrook« hatte das nicht nötig –, sondern aus einer persönlichen Neigung zum Superfeinen und Aristokratischen … wie sollte man das ausdrücken, Teufel noch mal! Und dann diese Zitate aus Heine und anderen Dichtern, die er manchmal bei den praktischsten Gelegenheiten, bei geschäftlichen oder städtischen Fragen in seine Rede einfließen ließ … Und nun diese Frau … Nein, auch an ihm selbst, an Konsul Buddenbrook war »ein bißchen was Gewisses« – – was selbstverständlich mit jederlei Respekt bemerkt werden sollte, denn die Familie war hoch achtbar, und die Firma war von höchster Bonität, und der Chef war ein gescheuter, liebenswürdiger Mann, der die Stadt liebte und ihr sicher noch erfolgreich dienen würde … Und es war ja auch eine höllisch feine Partie, man sprach von runden 100000 Talern Kurant … Indessen … Und unter den Damen befanden sich manche, die Gerda Arnoldsen ganz einfach »albern« fanden; wobei daran zu erinnern ist, daß »albern« einen sehr harten Ausdruck der Verurteilung bedeutete.","Since the Buddenbrooks' year of mourning had not yet ended, the two engagements were celebrated only in the family; Gerda Arnoldsen, however, became famous in the city quickly enough, yes, her person was the main topic of conversation at the stock exchange, in clubs, in the municipal theater, in society ... ""Tip top,"" said the suitiers and clicked their tongues, because that was it Hamburg's newest expression for something exquisitely fine, whether it was a red wine brand, a cigar, a diner or business creditworthiness. But among the solid, upright, and honorable citizens there were many who shook their heads...""Strange...those toilets, that hair, that posture, that face...a little rather strange."" Certain…” and he squirmed and frowned, as if he'd been offered a bad offer on the stock exchange. But it was Consul Buddenbrook… it looked like him. A little pretentious, this Thomas Buddenbrook, a little ... different: different from his ancestors too. It was known, especially the draper Benthien, that he not only got all his fine and new-fashioned clothes – and he owned an unusually large number of them: Pardessus, skirts, hats, waistcoats, trousers and ties – but also his underwear from Hamburg. It was even known that he changed his shirt every day, sometimes even twice a day, and that he handkerchief and Napoleon III-style robe. pulled-out mustache perfumed. And he didn't do all this for the sake of company and representation - the house ""Johann Buddenbrook"" didn't need that - but out of a personal inclination for the superfine and aristocratic ... how should one put it, hell! And then these quotations from Heine and other poets, which he sometimes included in his speech on the most practical occasions, on business or city issues... And now this woman... No, there was something certain about himself too, about Consul Buddenbrook « - - which of course should be noted with all respect, for the family was highly respectable and the company was of the highest credit standing and the boss was a shrewd, amiable man who loved the city and would certainly serve it successfully... And it was also a hell of a fine game, they talked about 100,000 thalers Kurant ... Meanwhile ... And among the ladies there were some who found Gerda Arnoldsen quite simply ""silly""; remembering that ""silly"" meant a very harsh expression of condemnation.","Since the Buddenbrooks’ year of mourning was not yet over, the two engagements were celebrated only within the family. Gerda Arnoldsen’s fame spread quickly through the town nonetheless—indeed, she was the main topic of conversation on the exchange, at the Club, in the theater, in society in general. “Tip-top,” the suitiers remarked, clicking their tongues—this was the latest term from Hamburg for something exquisite, be it a red wine, a cigar, a dinner, or a business coup. But among the solid, honest, and respectable citizens were many who shook their heads and said, “Peculiar, the way she dresses, and her hair, her posture, that face. Really a bit too peculiar.” Sörenson the merchant put it this way: “There’s a certain something about her …” and he turned his head to one side and made a face, as if someone were proposing a shady deal on the exchange. But it was just like Consul Buddenbrook —he was a little pretentious, Thomas Buddenbrook was, a little … different. Different from his forebears. Everyone knew, and Benthien the clothier in particular knew, that not only his fine and fashionable clothes—and he had an extraordinary wardrobe: overcoats, jackets, hats, vests, trousers, and cravats—came from Hamburg, but his underwear as well. It was said that he changed his shirt every day, sometimes twice a day, and that he perfumed his handkerchief and even his mustache, trimmed à la Napoleon III. And it was all done, not for the sake of the greater renown of the firm—the house of Johann Buddenbrook had no need of that—but out of a personal propensity for things refined and aristocratic, or whatever the devil you called all that. And then the way he would slip in those quotes from Heine and other poets, even when talking about the most practical matters, about business or civic issues. And now this woman for a wife. No, there was even “a certain something about him,” about Consul Buddenbrook. Of course, this was said with all due respect, because the family enjoyed the best of reputations, and the firm the finest credit; and the head of the firm was an able and charming man, who loved his town and would serve it most admirably as time went on. Certainly, it was a damn fine match; word had it that it came to one hundred thousand thalers courant … but all the same. And among the ladies were several who found Gerda Arnoldsen simply “silly”—a word, it will be recalled, that implied very severe condemnation.","As the year of mourning was not quite over, the two be- trothals were celebrated only in the family. But Gerda quickly became a celebrity in the town. Her person formed the chief subject of conversation on the Bourse, at the club, at the theatre, and in society. "" Tip-top,"" said the gallants, and clucked their tongues, for that was the latest Hamburg slang for a superior article, whether a brand of claret, a cigar, or a ""deal. "" But among the solid, respectable citizens there was much head-shaking. "" Something queer about her,"" they said. ""Her hair, her face, the way she dresses--a little too unusual."" Sorenson expressed it: ""She has a certain something about her!"" He made a face as if he were on the Bourse and somebody had made him a doubtful proposition. But it was all just like Consul Buddenbrook: a little pretentious, not like his forebears. Everybody knew--not least Benthien the draper--that he ordered his clothes from Hamburg: not only the fine new-fashioned materials for his suits--and he had a great many of them, cloaks, coats, waist-coats, and trousers--but his hats and cravats and linen as well. He changed his shirt every day, sometimes twice a day, and perfumed his handkerchief and his moustache, which he wori! cut like Napoleon III. All this was not for the sake of the firm, of course--the house of Johann Buddenbrook did not need that sort of thing--but to gratify his own personal taste for the superfine and aristocratic--or whatever you might call it. And then the quotations from Heine and other poets' which he dropped sometimes in the most practical connections, in business or civic matters! And now, his bride--well, Consul Buddenbrook himself had ""a certain something"" about him! All this, of course, with the greatest respect; for the family was highly esteemed, the firm very, very ""good,"" and the head of it an able and charming man who loved his city and would still serve her well. It was really a devilishly fine match for him; there was talk of a hundred thousand thaler down; but of course... Among the ladies there were some who found Gerda ""silly""; which, it will be recalled, was a very severe judgment .293 BUDDENBR DDKS"

Sie war nicht Lehrerin, sie wußte nichts von Strenge, und in Harmlosigkeit und stillem Frohsinn bestand ihr Wesen.

"Der jüngere Hausherr hatte, als der allgemeine Aufbruch begann, mit der Hand nach der linken Brustseite gegriffen, wo ein Papier knisterte, das gesellschaftliche Lächeln war plötzlich von seinem Gesicht verschwunden, um einem gespannten und besorgten Ausdruck Platz zu machen, und an seinen Schläfen spielten, als ob er die Zähne aufeinander bisse, ein paar Muskeln.

"Was Herrn Brecht persönlich betraf, so sah er ganz ähnlich aus wie Josephus, denn ebenso hart und krumm bog seine Nase sich auf den schwarz und grau melierten Schnurrbart hinab, wie der Schnabel des Papageis. Das Schlimme aber, das eigentlich Entsetzliche an ihm bestand darin, daß er nervös und selbst den Qualen nicht gewachsen war, die zuzufügen sein Amt ihn zwang. »Wir müssen zur Extraktion schreiten, Fräulein«, sagte er zu Ida Jungmann und erblich. Dann, wenn Hanno in einem matten, kalten Schweiße und mit übergroßen Augen, unfähig, zu protestieren, unfähig, davonzulaufen, in einem Seelenzustand, der sich absolut durch nichts von dem eines hinzurichtenden Delinquenten unterschied, Herrn Brecht, die Zange im Ärmel, auf sich zukommen sah, so konnte er bemerken, daß auf der kahlen Stirn des Zahnarztes kleine Schweißtropfen perlten, und daß sein Mund ebenfalls von Angst verzogen war … Und wenn der abscheuliche Vorgang vorüber, wenn Hanno, bleich, zitternd, mit tränenden Augen und entstelltem Gesicht, sein Blut in die blaue Schale zu seiner Seite spie, so mußte Herr Brecht einen Augenblick irgendwo Platz nehmen, sich die Stirn trocknen und ein wenig Wasser trinken …","As far as Herr Brecht was concerned personally, he looked very much like Josephus, for his nose bent down to the black and gray mottled mustache just as hard and crooked as the parrot's beak.

""We have to proceed to the extraction, Fraulein,"" he said to Ida Jungmann and hereditarily.

Viertes Kapitel,Chapter Four,4,CHAPTER IV
"Es war ein ganz einfaches Motiv, das er sich vorführte, ein Nichts, das Bruchstück einer nicht vorhandenen Melodie, eine Figur von anderthalb Takten, und als er sie zum erstenmal mit einer Kraft, die man ihm nicht zugetraut hätte, in tiefer Lage als einzelne Stimme ertönen ließ, wie als sollte sie von Posaunen einstimmig und befehlshaberisch als Urstoff und Ausgang alles Kommenden verkündigt werden, war gar nicht abzusehen, was eigentlich gemeint sei. Als er sie aber im Diskant, in einer Klangfarbe von mattem Silber, harmonisiert wiederholte, erwies sich, daß sie im wesentlichen aus einer einzigen Auflösung bestand, einem sehnsüchtigen und schmerzlichen Hinsinken von einer Tonart in die andere … eine kurzatmige, armselige Erfindung, der aber durch die preziöse und feierliche Entschiedenheit, mit der sie hingestellt und vorgebracht wurde, ein seltsamer, geheimnis- und bedeutungsvoller Wert verschafft ward. Und nun begannen bewegte Gänge, ein rastloses Kommen und Gehen von Synkopen, suchend, irrend und von Aufschreien zerrissen, wie als sei eine Seele voll Unruhe über das, was sie vernommen, und was doch nicht verstummen wollte, sondern in immer anderen Harmonien, fragend, klagend, ersterbend, verlangend, verheißungsvoll sich wiederholte. Und immer heftiger wurden die Synkopen, ratlos umhergedrängt von hastigen Triolen; die Schreie der Furcht jedoch, die hineinklangen, nahmen Gestalt an, sie schlossen sich zusammen, sie wurden zur Melodie, und der Augenblick kam, da sie wie ein inbrünstig und flehentlich hervortretender Gesang des Bläserchores stark und demütig zur Herrschaft gelangten. Das haltlos Drängende, das Wogende, Irrende und Entgleitende war verstummt und besiegt, und in unbeirrbar einfachem Rhythmus erscholl dieser zerknirschte und kindlich betende Choral … Mit einer Art von Kirchenschluß endete er. Eine Fermate kam, und eine Stille. Und siehe, plötzlich war, ganz leise, in einer Klangfarbe von mattem Silber, das erste Motiv wieder da, diese armselige Erfindung, diese dumme oder geheimnisvolle Figur, dieses süße, schmerzliche Hinsinken von einer Tonart in die andere. Da entstand ein ungeheurer Aufruhr und wild erregte Geschäftigkeit, beherrscht von fanfarenartigen Akzenten, Ausdrücken einer wilden Entschlossenheit. Was geschah? Was war in Vorbereitung? Es scholl wie Hörner, die zum Aufbruch riefen. Und dann trat etwas ein wie eine Sammlung und Konzentration, festere Rhythmen fügten sich zusammen, und eine neue Figur setzte ein, eine kecke Improvisation, eine Art Jagdlied, unternehmend und stürmisch. Aber es war nicht fröhlich, es war im Innersten voll verzweifelten Übermuts, die Signale, die darein tönten, waren gleich Angstrufen, und immer wieder war zwischen allem, in verzerrten und bizarren Harmonien, quälend, irrselig und süß, das Motiv, jenes erste, rätselhafte Motiv zu vernehmen … Und nun begann ein unaufhaltsamer Wechsel von Begebenheiten, deren Sinn und Wesen nicht zu erraten war, eine Flucht von Abenteuern des Klanges, des Rhythmus und der Harmonie, über die Hanno nicht Herr war, sondern die sich unter seinen arbeitenden Fingern gestalteten, und die er erlebte, ohne sie vorher zu kennen … Er saß, ein wenig über die Tasten gebeugt, mit getrennten Lippen und fernem, tiefem Blick, und sein braunes Haar bedeckte in weichen Locken seine Schläfen. Was geschah? Was wurde erlebt? Wurden hier furchtbare Hindernisse bewältigt, Drachen getötet, Felsen erklommen, Ströme durchschwommen, Flammen durchschritten? Und wie ein gellendes Lachen oder wie eine unbegreiflich selige Verheißung schlang sich das erste Motiv hindurch, dies nichtige Gebilde, dies Hinsinken von einer Tonart in die andere … ja, es war, als reize es auf zu immer neuen, gewaltsamen Anstrengungen, rasende Anläufe in Oktaven folgten ihm, die in Schreie ausklangen, und dann begann ein Aufschwellen, eine langsame, unaufhaltsame Steigerung, ein chromatisches Aufwärtsringen von wilder, unwiderstehlicher Sehnsucht, jäh unterbrochen durch plötzliche, erschreckende und aufstachelnde Pianissimi, die wie ein Weggleiten des Bodens unter den Füßen und wie ein Versinken in Begierde waren … Einmal war es, als ob fern und leise mahnend die ersten Akkorde des flehenden, zerknirschten Gebetes vernehmbar werden wollten; alsbald aber stürzte die Flut der empordrängenden Kakophonien darüber her, die sich zusammenballten, sich vorwärts wälzten, zurückwichen, aufwärts klommen, versanken und wieder einem unaussprechlichen Ziele entgegenrangen, das kommen mußte, nun kommen mußte, in diesem Augenblick, an diesem furchtbaren Höhepunkt, da die lechzende Drangsal zur Unerträglichkeit geworden war … Und es kam, es war nicht mehr hintanzuhalten, die Krämpfe der Sehnsucht hätten nicht mehr verlängert werden können, es kam, gleichwie wenn ein Vorhang zerrisse, Tore aufsprängen, Dornenhecken sich erschlossen, Flammenmauern in sich zusammensänken … Die Lösung, die Auflösung, die Erfüllung, die vollkommene Befriedigung brach herein, und mit entzücktem Aufjauchzen entwirrte sich alles zu einem Wohlklang, der in süßem und sehnsüchtigem Ritardando sogleich in einen anderen hinübersank … es war das Motiv, das erste Motiv, was erklang! Und was nun begann, war ein Fest, ein Triumph, eine zügellose Orgie ebendieser Figur, die in allen Klangschattierungen prahlte, sich durch alle Oktaven ergoß, aufweinte, im Tremolando verzitterte, sang, jubelte, schluchzte, angetan mit allem brausenden, klingelnden, perlenden, schäumenden Prunk der orchestralen Ausstattung sieghaft daherkam … Es lag etwas Brutales und Stumpfsinniges und zugleich etwas asketisch Religiöses, etwas wie Glaube und Selbstaufgabe in dem fanatischen Kultus dieses Nichts, dieses Stücks Melodie, dieser kurzen, kindischen, harmonischen Erfindung von anderthalb Takten … etwas Lasterhaftes in der Maßlosigkeit und Unersättlichkeit, mit der sie genossen und ausgebeutet wurde, und etwas zynisch Verzweifeltes, etwas wie Wille zu Wonne und Untergang in der Gier, mit der die letzte Süßigkeit aus ihr gesogen wurde, bis zur Erschöpfung, bis zum Ekel und Überdruß, bis endlich, endlich in Ermattung nach allen Ausschweifungen ein langes, leises Arpeggio in Moll hinrieselte, um einen Ton emporstieg, sich in Dur auflöste und mit einem wehmütigen Zögern erstarb.","It was a very simple motif that he presented to himself, a nothing, the fragment of a non-existent melody, a figure of a bar and a half, and when he first played them with a power that one would not have credited him with, they were in the lower register as individuals voice sounded as if it were to be announced by trumpets unanimously and authoritatively as the primeval substance and starting point of everything that was to come, it was impossible to foresee what was actually meant. But when he repeated it harmonized in the treble, in a timbre of dull silver, it proved to consist essentially of a single resolution, a yearning and painful sinking from one key to the other... a short-lived, poor invention, but which by the precious and solemn decisiveness with which it was presented and presented, a strange, mysterious, and significant value was created. And now turbulent passages began, a restless coming and going of syncopations, searching, wandering and torn apart by screams, as if a soul were full of unrest about what it had heard, and what still did not want to be silent, but was asking questions in ever-changing harmonies , lamenting, dying, demanding, full of promise repeated itself. And the syncopations became more and more violent, pushed around helplessly by hasty triplets; but the cries of fear that sounded within took shape, they joined together, they became melody, and the moment came when, like a fervent and pleading chant of the brass choir emerging, strong and humble, they came to rule. The unstoppable urge, the heaving, straying and slipping away had fallen silent and conquered, and this contrite and childishly praying chorale resounded in an unwaveringly simple rhythm... It ended with a kind of church closing. There was a pause, and a silence. And behold, suddenly, very softly, in a dull silver timbre, the first motive was there again, this poor invention, this stupid or mysterious figure, this sweet, painful sinking from one key into the other. There was tremendous uproar and wild excitement, dominated by fanfare-like accents, expressions of wild determination. What happened? What was in preparation? It sounded like horns calling for departure. And then there was something like a gathering and concentration, tighter rhythms joined together, and a new figure entered, a bold improvisation, a kind of hunting song, enterprising and boisterous. But it wasn't happy, it was full of desperate high spirits in its innermost being, the signals that sounded like cries of fear, and again and again between everything, in distorted and bizarre harmonies, tormenting, erratic and sweet, there was the motive, that first enigmatic motive to be heard ... And now an unstoppable change of events began, the meaning and nature of which could not be guessed, a flight from adventures in sound, rhythm and harmony, over which Hanno was not master but rather under his working fingers and which he experienced without knowing them beforehand... He sat, hunched over the keys a little, with parted lips and distant, deep gaze, and his brown hair covered his temples in soft curls. What happened? What was experienced? Were there terrible obstacles overcome, dragons slain, rocks scaled, streams swum, flames traversed? And like a roar of laughter, or like an incomprehensibly blissful promise, the first motive wound its way through, this futile structure, this sinking from one key to the other ... yes, it was as if it provoked new, violent efforts, frantic attempts in Octaves followed it, ending in screams, and then a swell began, a slow, unstoppable build-up, a chromatic upward struggle of wild, irresistible longing, abruptly interrupted by sudden, terrifying and rousing pianissimi, like the ground slipping away from under one's feet and like sinking into desire... Once it was as if the first chords of the imploring, contrite prayer wanted to be heard in a distant and gentle admonition; But immediately the tide of surging cacophonies rushed over it, which bunched up, rolled forward, receded, climbed up, sank and again struggled towards an unspeakable goal that had to come, now had to come, at this moment, at this terrible climax, there the pangs of tribulation had become unbearable ... And it came, it could no longer be held back, the spasms of longing could no longer have been prolonged, it came as if a curtain were torn, gates burst open, thorn hedges opened up, walls of flames collapsed ... The solution, the resolution, the fulfilment, the complete satisfaction broke in, and with delighted exultations everything unraveled into a euphony, which in a sweet and longing ritardando immediately sank into another ... it was the motive, the first motive, that sounded! And what now began was a celebration, a triumph, an unbridled orgy of this very figure, who boasted in all shades of sound, poured through all octaves, cried, trembled in tremolando, sang, cheered, sobbed, filled with everything that roared, jingled, sparkling , foaming splendor of the orchestral equipment came along victorious ... There was something brutal and dull and at the same time something ascetically religious, something like faith and self-abandonment in the fanatical cult of this nothingness, this piece of melody, this short, childish, harmonic invention of a bar and a half ... something vicious in the excessiveness and insatiability with which it was enjoyed and exploited, and something cynically desperate, something like the will to delight and perish in the greed with which the last sweetness was sucked out of it, to the point of exhaustion, to the point of disgust and weariness, until finally, finally exhausted after all the excesses, a long, soft arpeggio in minor trickled down, rose a note, resolved to major and died with a wistful hesitation.","He introduced a very simple theme, nothing really, a fragment of a nonexistent melody, a figure of a bar and a half; he first let it ring out in the bass, with a power one would not have expected of him, and it sounded like a chorus of trombones, imperiously announcing some fundamental principle, an opening onto what was yet to come—and with no clear indication of what it really meant. But when he repeated and harmonized it high in the treble, in tone colors like frosted silver, its essence was revealed to be a simple resolution, a yearning, painful descent from one key to another—a short-winded, paltry invention, which gained its strange, mysterious, momentous quality from the pretentious, resolute solemnity of its definition and presentation. And now followed agitated runs, a restless, syncopated coming and going, a searching and wandering, rent by shrieks, like a soul tormented by sounds that will not ebb into silence, but only repeat themselves in new harmonies, new questions and laments, new desires, demands, and promises. The syncopations grew more and more violent, helplessly jostled about by scurrying triplets. The intruding shrieks of fear, however, took form, closed ranks, became a melody—and then came the moment when they achieved mastery as a fervent, plaintive chorus of woodwinds raised in strong yet humble song. The prodding, faltering, straying, flagging uncertainty yielded and was conquered. In simple, determined rhythms, a contrite chorale resounded like a child’s prayer. And ended in a churchly cadence. And now a fermata, and silence. But wait, suddenly, very softly, in tone colors like frosted silver, the first theme returned, that paltry invention, that silly or mysterious pattern, that sweet, painful descent from one key to another. And there arose a great rebellion and a wild, frantic commotion, dominated by fanfarelike accents, declarations of savage determination. What was happening? What was coming now? It rang out like bugles sounding the charge. And then its forces seemed to assemble, concentrate themselves; firmer rhythms joined together and a new theme established itself, an impudent improvisation, a kind of hunting song, daring and stormy—but not joyful. At its heart was a desperate defiance; its signal calls were also cries of fear, and again and again, under it all, were heard the wrenched, bizarre harmonies of the first theme, that enigmatic theme, so distraught, demented, and sweet. And now began an inexorable succession of episodes, whose meaning and nature were obscure, a picaresque adventure of sound, rhythm, and harmony, which Hanno himself did not control, but merely let take shape under his busy fingers, each episode a new experience that he had not heard coming. He sat bent down over the keys, his lips parted, a distant, rapt look in his eyes, and his brown hair fell down over his temples in soft curls. What was happening? What was he feeling? Was this his way of overcoming dreadful obstacles? Was he slaying dragons, scaling mountains, swimming great rivers, walking through fire? And, like shrill laughter or some inscrutable promise of blessing, that first theme wound its way through everything—a fragment, nothing really, a descent from one key to another. Yes, it roused itself again now to new violent exertions, pursued by mad octave runs that fell away screaming; and a slow, unyielding surge began its ascent, a chromatic struggle upward, full of wild, irresistible desire, abruptly interrupted by bursts of appalling, taunting pianissimi, as if the ground were slipping away underfoot and the long slide down into lust had begun. Suddenly it seemed as if one could hear, very soft and far away, the censure of those first chords of contrite, suppliant prayer; but then, immediately, a flood of ascending cacophony pounced on it, gathered into a solid mass that trundled forward, fell back, scrambled up again, subsided, ceaselessly struggling to reach the ineffable goal that had to come, had to come now, at this moment, at this terrifying pinnacle, while unbearable anguish panted on all sides. And it came, it could not be held back any longer, the convulsions of desire could not be prolonged; it came—like curtains ripping open, doors flinging wide, thorny hedges sundering, walls of flame collapsing. Resolution, dissolution, fulfillment, perfect contentment burst overhead—and in ravished exultation everything untangled into a beautiful chord that descended now with a sweet, yearning ritardando into another chord. It was the theme, the first theme again! And what happened now was a celebration, a triumph, an unrestrained orgy of that same theme, reveling in all conceivable nuances, spilling through every octave, weeping, fluttering in a tremolando, singing, rejoicing, sobbing, marching victorious and laden with all the bluster, tinkling chimes, and churning pomp of a great orchestra. It was the fanatical cult of nothing, of a fragment of melody, a brief bar and a half of childish, harmonic invention—and there was something brutal and doltish about it, and something ascetic and religious at the same time, something like faith and self-renunciation; but there was also something insatiable and depraved beyond measure in the way it was savored and exploited. It sucked hungrily at its last sweet drops with almost cynical despair, with a deliberate willing of bliss and doom, and it fell away in exhaustion, revulsion, and surfeit, until finally, finally, in the languor that followed, all its excesses trickled off in a long, soft arpeggio in the minor, modulated up one key, resolved to the major, hesitated, and died a wistful death.","It was a simple motif which he employed--a mere trifle, an unfinished fragment of melody in one bar and a half. He brought it out first, with unsuspected power, in the bass, as a single voice: indicating it as the source and fount of all that was to come, and announcing it, with a commanding entry, by a burst of trumpets. It was not quite easy to grasp his intention; but when he repeated and harmonized it in the treble, with a timbre like dull silver, it proved to consist es-sentially of a single resolution, a yearning and painful melting of one tone into another--a short-winded, pitiful invention, which nevertheless gained a strange, mysterious, and signif-icant value precisely by means of the meticulous and solemn precision with which it was defined and produced. And now there began more lively passages, a restless coming and going of syncopated sound, seeking, wandering, torn by shrieks like a soul in unrest and tormented by some knowledge it possesses and cannot conceal, but must repeat in ever different harmonies, questioning, complaining, protesting, demanding, dying away. The syncopation increased, grew more pronounced, driven hither and thither by scampering triplets; the shrieks of fear recurred, they took form and became melody. There was a moment when they domi-nated, in a mounting, imploring chorus of wind-instruments that conquered the endlessly thronging, welling, wandering, 347 vanishing harmonies, and swelled out in unmistakable simple rhythms--a crushed, childlike, imposing, imploring chorale. This concluded with a sort of ecclesiastical cadence. A fermate followed, a silence. And then, quite softly, in a timbre of dull silver, there came the first motif again, the paltry invention, a figure either tiresome or obscure, a sweet, sentimental dying-away of one tone into another. This was followed by a tremendous uproar, a wild activity, punctu- ated by notes like fanfares, expressive of violent resolve. What was coming? Then came horns again, sounding the march; there was an assembling, a concentrating, firm, con- solidated rhythms; and a new figure began, a bold improvisa- tion, a sort of lively, stormy hunting song. There was no joy in this hunting song; its note was one of defiant despair. Signals sounded through it; yet they were not only signals but cries of fear; while throughout, winding through it all, through all the writhen, bizarre harmonies, came again that mysterious first motif, wandering in despair, torturingly sweet. And now began a ceaseless hurry of events whose sense and meaning could not be guessed, a restless flood of sound-ad- ventures, rhythms, harmonies, welling up uncontrolled from the keyboard, as they shaped themselves under Hanno's labour- ing fingers. He experienced them, as it were; he did not know them beforehand. He sat a little bent nvrr thei keys, with parted lips and deep, far gaze, his brown hair covering his forehead with its soft rurls. What was the meaning of what he played? Were these images of fearful difficulties surmounted flames passed through and torrents swum, castles stormed and dragons slain? But always--now like a yell- ing laugh, now like an ineffably sweet promise--the original motif wound through it all, the pitiful phrase with its notes melting into one another! Now the music seemrd la rouse itself to new and gigantic efforts: wild runs in octaves fol- lowed, sounding like shrieks; an irresistible mounting, a chromatic upward struggle, a wild relentless longing, abruptly broken by startling, arresting pianissimi which gave a sensa- lion as if the ground were disappearing from beneath one's feet, or like a sudden abandonment and sinking into a gulf of desire. Dnce, far off and softly warning, sounded the first chords of the imploring prayer; but the flood of rising cacophonies overwhelmed them with their rolling, streaming, clinging, sinking, and struggling up again, as they fought on toward the end that must come, must come this very moment, at the height of this fearful climax--for the pressure of longing had become intolerable. And it came; it could no longer be kept bai'k-- those spasms of yearning could not be pro-longed. And it came as though curtains were rent apart, doors sprang open, thorn-hedges parted of themselves, walls of flame sank down. The resolution, the redemption, the complete fulfilment--a chorus of jubilation burst forth, and everything resolved itself in a harmony--and the harmony, in bwei't ritardando, at once sank into another. It was the motif, ihe first motif! And now began a festival, a triumph, an unbounded orgy of this very figure, which now displayed a wealth of dynamic colour which passed through every octave, wept and shivered in tremolo, sang, rejoiced, and sobbed in exultation, triumphantly adorned with all the bursting, linkling, foaming, purling resources of orchestral pomp. The fanatical worship of this worthless trifle, this scrap of melody, this brief, childish harmonic invention only a bar and a half in le-ngth, had about it something stupid and gross, and at the same time something ascetic and religious--something that contained the essence of faith and renunciation. There was a quality of the perverse in the insatiability with which it was produced and revelled in: there was a sort of cynical despair; there was a longing for joy, a yielding to desire, in the way the last drop of sweetness was, as it were,, extracted from the melody, till exhaustion, disgust, and satiety supervened. Then, at last; at last, in the weariness after excess, a long, soft arpeggio in the minor trickled through, mounted a tone, unsolved itself in the major, and died in mournful lingering away"
"Einige blieben im Chemiesaale, und andere gingen ins Klassenzimmer hinauf; aber auf dem Hofe brauchte jetzt niemand zu frieren, denn droben auf dem Korridor hatte schon während der Pause Herr Modersohn die Aufsicht, und der wagte keinen hinunterzuschicken. Auch galt es, Vorbereitungen zu seinem Empfange zu treffen …","Some stayed in the chemistry room and others went up to the classroom; but nobody in the yard needed to be cold now, because up in the corridor Herr Modersohn was already supervising during the break, and he didn't dare send anyone down. It was also necessary to make preparations for his reception...","Several boys remained behind in the chemistry hall and others went back up to their homeroom; but no one was forced to go down into the freezing courtyard, because Herr Modersohn was in charge of the corridor upstairs now and did not even dare try to send anyone outside. Besides, their task was now to prepare for his arrival in the room.","Some of the form remained in the chemistry hall, others went up to the classroom; nobody needed to go down and freeze in the courtyard, because Herr Modersohn was in charge up in the corridors1, and he never dared send any one down.

"»Pfühl«, sagte sie, »seien Sie billig und nehmen Sie die Sache mit Ruhe. Seine ungewohnte Art im Gebrauch der Harmonien verwirrt Sie … Sie finden, im Vergleich damit, Beethoven rein, klar und natürlich.

Greater, more conscious, deeper than with Bach. Believe me, Pfühl, this music is less alien to your innermost being than you think!”","“Pfühl,” she said, “be reasonable, just take it in calmly. His unusual use of harmony confuses you. You find Beethoven pure, clear, and natural in comparison. But remember how Beethoven disconcerted his contemporaries, whose ears were trained to the old ways. And Bach himself, good Lord, they accused him of being dissonant and muddy.

But remember how Beethoven himself affronted his contemporaries, who were brought up in the old way. And Bach--why, good Heavens, you know how he was reproached for his want of melody and clearness! You talk aboul honesty--but what do you mean by honesty in art? Is it not the antithesis of hedonism? And, if so, then that is what you have here. Just as much as in Bach.

"Renee Maria von Throta, aus den Rheinlanden gebürtig, stand als Sekondeleutnant bei einem der Infanteriebataillone, die in der Stadt garnisonierten. Der rote Kragen nahm sich gut aus zu seinem schwarzen Haar, das seitwärts gescheitelt und rechts in einem hohen, dichten und gelockten Kamm von der weißen Stirn zurückgestrichen war. Aber obwohl er groß und stark von Gestalt erschien, rief seine ganze Erscheinung, seine Bewegungen sowohl wie seine Art zu sprechen und zu schweigen, einen äußerst unmilitärischen Eindruck hervor. Er liebte es, eine Hand zwischen die Knöpfe seines halb offenen Interimsrockes zu schieben oder dazusitzen, indem er die Wange gegen den Handrücken lehnte; seine Verbeugungen entbehrten jeglicher Strammheit, man hörte nicht einmal seine Absätze dabei zusammenschlagen, und er behandelte die Uniform an seinem muskulösen Körper genau so nachlässig und launisch wie einen Zivilanzug.

He loved sliding a hand between the buttons of his half-open interim skirt or sitting with his cheek against the back of his hand; his bows were not taut, you couldn't even hear his heels clicking, and he handled the uniform on his muscular frame as carelessly and capriciously as a civilian suit. Even his narrow youthful moustache, which runs diagonally down to the corners of his mouth and could not have been given a point or curve, helped to reinforce this unmartial general impression.

"»Gott, nein, er sah nicht gemütlich aus«, sagte er, indem er einen Bissen von Schinken, Rosenkohl und Kartoffel, den er auf seiner Gabel komponiert, mit erhobenen Brauen in den Mund schob. »Übrigens soll er sich ganz heiter benommen haben, in Danzig. Man erzählte sich damals einen Scherz … Er hasardierte den ganzen Tag mit den Deutschen, und zwar nicht eben harmlos, abends aber spielte er mit seinen Generälen. ›N'est-ce pas, Rapp‹, sagte er, und griff eine Handvoll Gold vom Tische, ›les Allemands aiment beaucoup ces petits Napoléons?‹ – ›Oui, Sire, plus que le Grand!‹ antwortete Rapp …«","""God, no, he didn't look cozy,"" he said, munching a bite of ham, Brussels sprouts, and potato he's composing on his fork, brows raised. “By the way, he is said to have behaved quite cheerfully in Danzig.

"Übrigens beeinflußten diese Zahnbeschwerden nicht nur seine Gemütsstimmung, sondern auch die Funktionen einzelner Organe. Die Behinderungen beim Kauen hatten immer wieder Verdauungsstörungen, ja auch Anfälle von gastrischem Fieber zur Folge, und diese Magenverstimmungen standen im Zusammenhange mit vorübergehenden Anfällen von verstärktem oder geschwächtem unregelmäßigen Herzschlag und Schwindelgefühlen. Bei all dem bestand unvermindert, ja verstärkt, das seltsame Leiden fort, das Doktor Grabow »pavor nocturnus« nannte. Kaum eine Nacht verging, ohne daß der kleine Johann ein- oder zweimal emporfuhr und händeringend, mit allen Anzeichen der unerträglichsten Angst nach Hilfe oder Erbarmen rief, als stände er in Flammen, als wollte man ihn erwürgen, als geschähe etwas unsäglich Grauenhaftes … Am Morgen wußte er nichts mehr von allem. – Doktor Grabow suchte dieses Leiden mit einem abendlichen Trunk von Heidelbeersaft zu behandeln; allein das half ganz und gar nichts.","Incidentally, these dental problems not only affected his mood, but also the functions of individual organs. The hindrances to chewing always resulted in indigestion, even attacks of gastric fever, and these stomach upsets were associated with transient attacks of increased or decreased irregular heartbeat and dizziness. Despite all this, the strange suffering that Doctor Grabow called ""pavor nocturnus"" continued unabated, even increased. Scarcely a night went by without little Johann jerking up once or twice, wringing his hands and crying out for help or mercy with every sign of the most unbearable fear, as if he were on fire, as if someone were about to strangle him, as if something unspeakably horrible was happening... In the morning he no longer knew anything about everything. – Doctor Grabow tried to treat this ailment with an evening drink of blueberry juice; but that didn't help at all.","His dental problems affected not only his frame of mind but also the function of several vital organs. Because he had difficulty chewing, he had constant digestive problems, including several attacks of gastric fever; and his stomach pains were partly responsible for occasional dizzy spells, when his heart would beat too hard or too weakly and his pulse became irregular. And all the while his old disorder—the one that Dr. Grabow had diagnosed as pavor nocturnus—continued—indeed, grew worse. There was hardly a night when little Johann did not start up in bed at least once or twice, wringing his hands and crying for help or pleading for mercy, exhibiting all the signs of the most awful panic, as if he were being burned alive or strangled, as if something ghastly beyond all description were happening to him. And in the morning he would remember nothing at all. Dr. Grabow attempted to treat this affliction with a glass of blueberry juice before bed—but that did not help in the least.","This trouble with his teeth affected not only his spirits but also the functioning of all his other organs. What he could not chew he did not digest, and there rame attacks of gastric fever, accompanied by fitful heart action, according as the heart was either weakened or too strongly stimulated. And there were spells of giddiness, while the pavor nocturnus, that strange affliction beloved of Dr. Crabow, continued un- abated. Hardly a night passed that little Johann did not start up in bed, wringing his hands with every mark of un- bearable anguish, and crying out piteously for help, as though some one were trying to choke him or some other awful thing were happening. In the morning he had forgotten it all. Dr. Grabow's treatment consisted of giving fruit-juice before the child went to bed; which had absolutely no effect."

"Übrigens verhehlten sie sich nicht – und übernahmen keineswegs die Verantwortung, es zu verschweigen –, daß der kleine Johann zum Erschrecken langsam gehen und sprechen lerne … Sie waren im Rechte damit, und es ist zuzugeben, daß Hanno – dies war der Rufname, den Frau Senator Buddenbrook für ihren Sohn eingeführt hatte – zu einer Zeit, als er alle Mitglieder seiner Familie mit ziemlicher Korrektheit zu nennen vermochte, noch immer außerstande war, die Namen Friederike, Henriette und Pfiffi in verständlicher Weise zu bilden. Was das Gehen betraf, so war ihm jetzt, im Alter von fünf Vierteljahren, noch kein selbständiger Schritt gelungen, und es war um diese Zeit, daß die Damen Buddenbrook mit hoffnungslosem Kopfschütteln erklärten, dieses Kind werde stumm und lahm bleiben für sein ganzes Leben.","Incidentally, they did not hide from themselves - and in no way took on the responsibility of concealing it - that little Johann was learning to walk and talk slowly, which was frightening... They were right about that, and it must be admitted that Hanno - that was the nickname that Frau Senator Buddenbrook had introduced for her son - at a time when he was able to name all members of his family with reasonable accuracy, was still unable to form the names Friederike, Henriette and Pfiffi in an understandable way. As for walking, he had not yet managed to take an independent step at the age of five quarters, and it was about this time that the Buddenbrook ladies, shaking their heads hopelessly, declared that this child would remain mute and lame for life.","And of course they could not conceal—indeed, found it irresponsible to be silent about— the fact that little Johann was horribly slow learning to walk and talk. They were right about that, and it must be admitted that Hanno—this was Gerda Buddenbrook’s nickname for him, which they all used—found it impossible to make intelligible words of the names Friederike, Henriette, and Pfiffi, even though he was able to pronounce the names of all the other members of the family with passable accuracy. And in terms of walking, at fifteen months he had not yet managed a single independent step. It was at about this time that the Ladies Buddenbrook declared, shaking their heads hopelessly, that the child would be mute and lame for the rest of his life.","They could not dissimulate, and they would accept no responsibility for omitting to say that little Johann was fright-fully slow about learning to walk and talk. They were really quite right: it was an admitted fact that Hanno--this was the nickname adopted by the Frau Senator for her son--at a time when he was able to call all the members of his family by name with fair correctness, was incapable of pronouncing the names Friederike, Henriette, and Pfiffi so that any one could understand what he said. And at fifteen months he had not taken a single step alone. The Misses Buddenbrook, shaking their heads pessimistically, declared that the child would be halt and tongue-tied to the end of his days."
"Hanno, bleich vor Erregung, hatte bei Tische fast nichts essen können; aber jetzt war die Hingebung an sein Werk, das, ach, nach zwei Minuten schon wieder zu Ende sein sollte, so groß in ihm, daß er in vollständiger Entrücktheit alles um sich her vergessen hatte. Dies kleine melodische Gebilde war mehr harmonischer als rhythmischer Natur, und ganz seltsam mutete der Gegensatz an, der zwischen den primitiven, fundamentalen und kindlichen musikalischen Mitteln und der gewichtigen, leidenschaftlichen und fast raffinierten Art bestand, in welcher diese Mittel betont und zur Geltung gebracht wurden. Mit einer schrägen und ziehenden Bewegung des Kopfes nach vorn hob Hanno bedeutsam jeden Übergangston hervor, und, ganz vorn auf dem Sessel sitzend, suchte er durch Pedal und Verschiebung jedem neuen Akkord einen empfindlichen Wert zu verleihen. In der Tat, wenn der kleine Hanno einen Effekt erzielte – und beschränkte sich derselbe auch ganz allein auf ihn selbst –, so war der Effekt weniger empfindsamer als empfindlicher Natur. Irgendein ganz einfacher harmonischer Kunstgriff ward durch gewichtige und verzögernde Akzentuierung zu einer geheimnisvollen und preziösen Bedeutung erhoben. Irgendeinem Akkord, einer neuen Harmonie, einem Einsatz wurde, während Hanno die Augenbrauen emporzog und mit dem Oberkörper eine hebende, schwebende Bewegung vollführte, durch eine plötzlich eintretende, matt hallende Klanggebung eine nervös überraschende Wirkungsfähigkeit zuteil … Und nun kam der Schluß, Hannos geliebter Schluß, der an primitiver Gehobenheit dem Ganzen die Krone aufsetzte. Leise und glockenrein umperlt und umflossen von den Läufen der Violine, tremolierte pianissimo der E-Mollakkord … Er wuchs, er nahm zu, er schwoll langsam, langsam an, im forte zog Hanno das dissonierende, zur Grundtonart leitende Cis herzu, und während die Stradivari wogend und klingend auch dieses Cis umrauschte, steigerte er die Dissonanz mit aller seiner Kraft bis zum fortissimo. Er verweigerte sich die Auflösung, er enthielt sie sich und den Hörern vor. Was würde sie sein, diese Auflösung, dieses entzückende und befreite Hineinsinken in H-Dur? Ein Glück ohnegleichen, eine Genugtuung von überschwänglicher Süßigkeit. Der Friede! Die Seligkeit! Das Himmelreich!… Noch nicht … noch nicht! Noch einen Augenblick des Aufschubs, der Verzögerung, der Spannung, die unerträglich werden mußte, damit die Befriedigung desto köstlicher sei … Noch ein letztes, allerletztes Auskosten dieser drängenden und treibenden Sehnsucht, dieser Begierde des ganzen Wesens, dieser äußersten und krampfhaften Anspannung des Willens, der sich dennoch die Erfüllung und Erlösung noch verweigerte, weil er wußte: Das Glück ist nur ein Augenblick … Hannos Oberkörper reckte sich langsam empor, seine Augen wurden ganz groß, seine geschlossenen Lippen zitterten, mit einem stoßweisen Beben zog er die Luft durch die Nase ein … und dann war die Wonne nicht mehr zurückzuhalten. Sie kam, kam über ihn, und er wehrte ihr nicht länger. Seine Muskeln spannten sich ab, ermattet und überwältigt sank sein Kopf auf die Schulter nieder, seine Augen schlossen sich, und ein wehmütiges, fast schmerzliches Lächeln unaussprechlicher Beseligung umspielte seinen Mund, während mit Verschiebung und Pedal, umflüstert, umwoben, umrauscht und umwogt von den Läufen der Violine, sein Tremolo, dem er nun Baßläufe gesellte, nach H-Dur hinüberglitt, sich ganz rasch zum fortissimo steigerte und dann mit einem kurzen, nachhallosen Aufbrausen abbrach. –","Hanno, pale with excitement, had hardly been able to eat anything at the table; but now the devotion to his work, which, alas, was to be over again after two minutes, was so great in him that in complete rapture he had forgotten everything around him. This little melodic structure was more harmonic than rhythmic in nature, and quite strange was the contrast that existed between the primitive, fundamental, and childlike musical devices and the weighty, passionate, and almost refined way in which these devices were emphasized and brought to bear . With a slanting and pulling movement of the head forward, Hanno significantly emphasized each transition note, and, sitting at the front of the chair, he sought through pedal and displacement to give each new chord a delicate value. In fact, when little Hanno achieved an effect - even if it was limited to himself alone - the effect was less sensitive than delicate. Some quite simple harmonic artifice was elevated to a mysterious and precious significance by weighty and retarding accentuation. Some chord, a new harmony, an entry, while Hanno raised his eyebrows and performed a lifting, floating movement with his upper body, was given a nervously surprising effectiveness by a suddenly occurring, faintly echoing sound ... And now came the end, Hanno's beloved end , who crowned it all with primitive exaltation. The E minor chord played pianissimo, quietly and as pure as a bell, and flowed around by the runs of the violin surging and ringing around this C sharp, he increased the dissonance with all his strength to fortissimo. He refused the dissolution, he withheld it from himself and the listeners. What would it be, this dissolution, this delightful and liberated sinking into B major? A happiness beyond compare, a satisfaction of exuberant sweetness. The peace! The bliss! The Kingdom of Heaven!... Not yet... Not yet! One more moment of delay, of delay, of tension that had to become unbearable so that the satisfaction would be all the more delicious... One last, very last savoring of this urgent and driving longing, this desire of the whole being, this extreme and spasmodic strain of the will, who still refused fulfillment and salvation because he knew: Happiness is only for a moment... Hanno's upper body slowly stretched upwards, his eyes widened, his closed lips trembled, with a spasmodic tremor he drew air through his nose a … and then the bliss could no longer be held back. She came, came over him and he stopped her no longer. His muscles tensed, exhausted and overwhelmed, his head fell on his shoulder, his eyes closed, and a wistful, almost painful smile of inexpressible bliss played about his mouth, while with shift and pedal, whispered, surrounded, rustled and waved from the runs of the violin, his tremolo, which he now joined with bass runs, glided over to B major, quickly increased to fortissimo and then broke off with a short, echoless outburst. –","Pale with excitement, Hanno had been able to eat almost nothing at dinner; but now, forgetting everything around him and removed from the world, he surrendered himself totally to his composition—which, alas, would be over in two minutes. The nature of his little melodic fantasia was more harmonic than rhythmic, and there was a very strange contrast between the basic, rudimentary musical resources at the child’s disposal and the momentous, passionate, and almost elegant way he emphasized and enhanced them. Hanno stressed each modulation with a tilt and bob of his head, and, shifting forward to the edge of his seat, he used the pedal to give each new chord emotional value. Indeed, if little Hanno achieved any effect at all—even if it was limited only to himself—it was less a matter of sentiment than of sensitivity. By retarding or heavily accenting some very simple harmonic maneuver, he gave it a higher, mysterious, precious meaning. Raising his eyebrows, rocking or lifting his upper body, he would suddenly introduce a faintly echoing tone-color to some new chord, harmonic device, or attack, lending it a surprising nervous energy. And now came the ending, Hanno’s beloved finale, which was to add the final simple, sublime touch to the whole composition. Wrapped in the sparkling, bubbling runs of the violin, which rang out with gentle, bell-like purity, he struck the E-minor chord tremolo pianissimo. It grew, broadened, swelled slowly, very slowly, and once it was at forte, Hanno sounded the dissonant C sharp that would lead back to the original key; and while the Stradivarius surged and dashed sonorously around the same C sharp, he used all his strength to crescendo the dissonance to fortissimo. He refused to resolve the chord, withheld it from himself and his audience. What would the resolution be like, this ravishing and liberating submersion into B major? Incomparable joy, the delight of sweet rapture. Peace, bliss, heaven itself. Not yet, not yet—one moment more of delay, of unbearable tension that would make the release all the more precious. He wanted one last taste of this insistent, urgent longing, of this craving that filled his whole being, of this cramped and strained exertion of will, which at the same time refused all fulfillment and release—he knew that happiness lasts only a moment. Hanno’s upper body slowly straightened up, his eyes grew large, his tightly closed lips quivered, he jerked back, drawing air in through his nose—and then that blessedness could be held back no longer. It came, swept over him, and he no longer fought it. His muscles relaxed; overwhelmed, he let his weary head sink back on his shoulders. His eyes closed, and a melancholy, almost pained smile of unutterable ecstasy played about his mouth. And while the violin whispered, wove, surged, and dashed around his tremolo, he shifted the pedal and added the base cadence that slid into B major, abruptly swelled to fortissimo; and then, with one brief burst, it broke off without a trace of echo.","The Frau Consul, Frau Permanrder, Christian, Clothilde, Herr and Frau Consul Kroger, Herr and Frau Director Wrin-sL'henk, the Broad Street Buddenbrooks, and Therese Weich-brodt were all bidden to dinner at four o'clruk, with the Senator and his wife, in honour of Hanno's birthday; and now they sat in the salon and looked at the child, perched on the music-stool in his sailor suit, and at the elegant, foreign appearance his mother made as she played a wonderful cantilena on the G string, and then, with profound vir-tuosity, developed a stream of purling, foaming cadences. The silver on the end of her bow gleamed in the gas-light. B major chord? A joy beyond compare, a gratification of overpowering sweetness! Peace! Bliss! The kingdom of Heaven: only not yet--not yet! A moment more of striving, hesitation, suspense, that must become well-nigh intolerable in order to heighten the ultimate moment of joy.--Once mnre--a last, a final tasting of this striving and yearning, this craving of the entire being, this last forcing of the will to deny oneself the fulfilment and"" the conclusion, in the knowledge that joy, when it comes, lasts only for the moment. The whole upper part of Hanno's little body straightened, his eyes grew larger, his closed lips trembled, he breathed short, spas-modic breaths through his nose. At last, at last, joy would no longer be denied. It came, it poured over him; he resisted no more. His muscles relaxed, his head sank weakly on his shoulder, his eyes closed, and a pathetic, almost an anguished smile of speechless rapture hovered about his mouth; while his tremolo, among the rippling and rustling runs from the violin, to which he now added runs in the bass, glided over into B major, swelled up suddenly into forte, and after one brief, resounding burst, broke off."
"Er schwieg, unglücklich darüber, daß er zuletzt nicht »und« gesagt und die Stimme mit Entschiedenheit gesenkt hatte; denn nun wußte er nicht mehr zu nennen, und die ganze Antwort war wieder abrupt und ungeschlossen hervorgebracht. – »Mehr nicht«, sagte er, so bestimmt er konnte, wenn auch ohne aufzublicken.

His father, however, hadn’t seemed to notice; he was distracted somehow, not really paying attention to anything Hanno said. He just held the boy’s free hand in his, playing with it and letting his fingers run slowly along the delicate wrist.","He stopped and felt provoked with himself; he could not remember any more, and wished he had said and and let his voice fall, it sounded so abrupt and unfinished.

No sooner would she take time to catch her breath than new words were gushing and surging out of her. Yes, she was able to put it all in words, all the disgust stored up over the past few years—a little disordered and confused, but she found the words.

I have the use of my senses. I don't say that Mother would actually insist on it--when there is a dispute over anything she usually avoids it and says 'Assez!' But Tom wants it. I know Tom. He thinks: 'Anybody! Anybody who isn't absolutely impossible.' For this time it is not a question of a brilliant match, but just one that will make good the other one. That is what he thinks. As soon as Permaneder ap-peared, you mny be sure that Tom made all the proper in-quiries about his business, and found it was all right-- and then, as far as he was concerned, the matter was settled. Tom is a politician--he knows what he wants. Who was it threw Christian out? That is strong language, Ida, but that was really the truth of it. And why? Because he was com promising the firm and the family. And in his eyes I do th * same thing--not with words or acts, but by my very existence as a divorcrd woman. He wants that put an end to, and he is right. I love him none the less for that--nor, I hope, does he me. In all these years, I have always longed to be out in the world again; it is so dull here in this house. God punish me if that is a sin: but I am not much more than thirty, and I still feel young.

"Morgen kam der dritte Weihnachtsabend an die Reihe, die Bescherung bei Therese Weichbrodt, und er freute sich darauf als auf ein kleines burleskes Spiel. Therese Weichbrodt hatte im vorigen Jahre ihr Pensionat gänzlich aufgegeben, so daß nun Madame Kethelsen das Stockwerk und sie selbst das Erdgeschoß des kleinen Hauses am Mühlenbrink allein bewohnte. Die Beschwerden nämlich, die ihr mißglückter und gebrechlicher kleiner Körper ihr verursachte, hatten mit den Jahren zugenommen, und in aller Sanftmut und christlichen Bereitwilligkeit nahm Sesemi Weichbrodt an, daß ihre Abberufung nahe bevorstehe. Daher hielt sie auch seit mehreren Jahren schon jedes Weihnachtsfest für ihr letztes und suchte der Feier, die sie in ihren kleinen, fürchterlich überheizten Stuben veranstaltete, so viel Glanz zu verleihen, wie in ihren schwachen Kräften stand. Da sie nicht viel zu kaufen vermochte, so verschenkte sie jedes Jahr einen neuen Teil ihrer bescheidenen Habseligkeiten und baute unter dem Baume auf, was sie nur entbehren konnte: Nippsachen, Briefbeschwerer, Nadelkissen, Glasvasen und Bruchstücke ihrer Bibliothek, alte Bücher in drolligen Formaten und Einbänden, das »Geheime Tagebuch von einem Beobachter Seiner Selbst«, Hebels Alemannische Gedichte, Krummachers Parabeln … Hanno besaß schon von ihr eine Ausgabe der »Pensées de Blaise Pascal«, die so winzig war, daß man nicht ohne Vergrößerungsglas darin lesen konnte.","Tomorrow it was the turn of the third Christmas Eve, giving presents to Therese Weichbrodt, and he looked forward to it like a little burlesque game. Therese Weichbrodt had completely given up her boarding school last year, so that Madame Kethelsen now lived alone on the first floor and she herself on the ground floor of the little house on the Mühlenbrink. For the ailments her ill-fated and frail little body caused her had increased over the years, and with all gentleness and Christian alacrity Sesemi Weichbrodt assumed that her recall was imminent. For this reason, for several years now, she has considered every Christmas to be her last and tried to give the celebration, which she organized in her small, terribly overheated room, as much splendor as was within her feeble strength. Not being able to buy much, she gave away a new part of her modest belongings every year and built up under the tree whatever she could spare: bric-a-brac, paperweights, pincushions, glass vases and fragments of her library, old books in funny formats and Bindings, the ""Secret Diary of an Observer of Himself"", Hebe's Alemannic Poems, Krummacher's Parables ... Hanno already owned a copy of her Pensées de Blaise Pascal, which was so tiny that one could not read it without a magnifying glass.","And tomorrow there would be a third Christmas party, when presents were opened at Therese Weichbrodt’s—and he looked forward to it as a kind of little burlesque farce. Therese Weichbrodt had closed her boarding school for good the previous year, so that, although Madame Kethelsen continued to live upstairs, Therese had the whole ground floor of the little house on Mühlenbrink to herself. The infirmities caused by her deformed, fragile little body had grown worse in the last few years, and, with meek Christian resignation, Sesame Weichbrodt trusted that she would soon be called to her heavenly reward. Which was why, for several years now, she had assumed that every Christmas would be her last and tried to lend the festivities in her little, dreadfully overheated home all the luster that her diminished energies permitted. She did not have the means to buy much, and so each year she gave away another portion of her modest possessions and set under her tree whatever she could possibly do without: knickknacks, paperweights, pincushions, glass vases, and scraps of her library, old books with odd shapes and whimsical bindings—The Secret Journal of a Student of Himself, Hebel’s Alemannic Poems, Krummacher’s Parables. Hanno had already been given an edition of the Pensées by Blaise Pascal, which was so tiny that you could not read it without a magnifying glass.","Next day there would be a third Christmas partv, at Fraulein Weirhbrodt's. He looked forward to it as to a comic performance in the theatre. Therese Weichbrodt had given up her pensionnat in the past year. Madame Kethelsen now occupied the first storey of the house on the Mill Brink, and she herself the ground floor, and there they lived alone. The burden of her deformed little body grew heavier with the years, and she concluded, with Christian humility and submission, that the end was not far off. For some years now she had believed that each Christmas was her last; and she strove with all the powers at her command to give a depart-151 ing brilliance to the feast that was held in her small over-heated rooms. Her means were very narrow, and she gave away each year a part of her possessions to swell the heap of gifts under the tree: knick-knacks, paper-weights, emery-bags, needle-cushions, glass vases, and fragments of her library, miscellaneous bnoks of every shape and size. Books like ""The Secret Journal of a Student of Himself,"" Rebel's ""Alemannian Poems,"" Krummacher's ""Parables""--Han no had once received an edition of the ""Pensees de Blaise Pascal,"" in such tiny print that it had to be read with a glass."

Was aber die Familie betraf, so war Justus Kröger der erste, der am Donnerstag das Bevorstehende zur Sprache brachte, und Frau Permaneder sorgte dafür, daß, war das Dessert abgetragen, die ehrwürdige Ledermappe mit den Familiendokumenten feierlich aufgelegt ward, und daß man als Vorfeier sich mit den Daten, die aus dem Leben des seligen Johan Buddenbrook, Hannos Ur-Ur-Großvater, des Gründers der Firma, bekannt waren, eingehend beschäftigte.

But as far as the family was concerned, Justus Kröger was the first to bring up what was to come on Thursday, and Mrs. Permaneder made sure that, once the dessert had been taken away, the venerable leather folder with the family documents was ceremonially laid out, and that as a preliminary celebration studied in detail the data known from the life of the late Johan Buddenbrook, Hanno's great-great-grandfather, the founder of the company. When he had the sores and when he had the real smallpox, when he had fallen from the third floor onto the kiln and when he had fallen into a violent fever with madness, she left with a religious seriousness. She couldn't do enough, she went back to the 16th century to the oldest known Buddenbrook, to the one who had been a councilor in Grabau and to the garment tailor in Rostock, who was ""very well suited"" - which was underlined - and had so many children, alive and dead...

Within the family, Uncle Justus was the first to mention the upcoming event one Thursday evening; but the moment the dessert dishes had been cleared, Frau Permaneder saw to it that the venerable leather writing case with the family documents was solemnly brought out; and, as a kind of foretaste to the celebration, she made sure that everyone became intimately reacquainted with all the facts known about the life of the first Johann Buddenbrook, the founder of the firm and Hanno’s great-great-grandfather. With pious fervor she read it all aloud: when he had a case of boils and when he had genuine pox, when he had fallen from the fourth story onto the drying-room floor and when he had been delirious with a high fever. She simply could not get enough. She followed the story back to the sixteenth century, to the oldest known Buddenbrook, the man who had been an alderman in Grabau, and to the merchant tailor in Rostock who “had done very well”—this was underlined—siring a remarkable number of children, some of whom had lived, some of whom had not. “ What a splendid man!” she cried and began to read aloud from some of the old yellowed, tattered letters and festive poems.","She was right; the day could not be passed over in silence.

"Aber ein bleicher, bartloser Mensch, dessen Alter nicht zu bestimmen ist und der morgens mit einem traurigen Lächeln in der Breiten Straße zu lustwandeln pflegt, kann nichts dafür, wenn er gezwungen ist, bei jedem plötzlichen Laut, den man ausstößt – zum Beispiel »Ha!« oder »Ho!« – auf einem Beine zu tanzen; und dennoch ließ Tony ihn tanzen, sobald sie ihn zu Gesichte bekam. Es ist ferner nicht schön, eine ganz winzige kleine Frau mit großem Kopfe, welche die Gewohnheit hat, bei jeder Witterung einen ungeheuren, durchlöcherten Schirm über sich aufgespannt zu halten, beständig durch Rufe wie »Schirmmadame!« oder »Champignon!« zu betrüben; und es ist tadelnswert, wenn man mit zwei oder drei gleichgesinnten Freundinnen vor dem Häuschen der alten Puppenliese erscheint, die in einer engen Twiete bei der Johannisstraße mit wollenen Puppen handelt und allerdings ganz merkwürdig rote Augen hat, – dort aus Leibeskräften die Glocke zieht und, wenn die Alte herauskommt, mit falscher Freundlichkeit fragt, ob hier vielleicht Herr und Madame Spucknapf wohnen, worauf man mit großem Gekreisch davonrennt … Das alles aber tat Tony Buddenbrook und zwar, wie es schien, mit völlig gutem Gewissen.

Furthermore, it is not nice to constantly sadden a tiny little woman with a big head, who is in the habit of holding an enormous, perforated umbrella over her in all weathers, with calls like ""Umbrella lady!"" or ""Mushroom!"" and it is reprehensible if you show up with two or three like-minded friends in front of the little house of old Puppenliese, who sells woolen dolls in a narrow twiete on Johannisstrasse and has strangely red eyes, - pulls the bell there with all her might and, when the old woman comes out, asks with false friendliness whether Mr. and Madame Spuckbattle live here, whereupon you run away with a great squeal... But Tony Buddenbrook did all this, and with a perfectly good conscience, it seemed.

And there was nothing nice about the distress that cries of “Madame Brella” or “Miss Mushroom” caused a tiny little woman with a large head, whose habit it was to protect herself in bad weather with a monstrous umbrella full of holes. And it was quite reprehensible for two or three like-minded girlfriends to appear at the door of the elderly lady who sold woolen dolls in the narrow alley off Johannis Strasse—although, admittedly, she did have the most curious red eyes—to tug at her bell as hard as they could, and, when the old woman came out, to ask in a deceptively friendly voice whether this might be the residence of Herr or Madame Spittoon, and then to run away screeching loudly. But Tony had done it all, and, so it seemed, with a perfectly good conscience. Because, if any of these tortured creatures dared to threaten her, it was a sight to behold how she would take a step back, toss her pretty head with its protruding upper lip, and utter a half-shocked, half-contemptuous “Pooh!,” as if to say: “Just try and get me in trouble!

Then there was an odd, tiny little woman with a large head, who put up a huge tattered umbrella at every sign of a storm. Tony would harass this poor soul with cries of ""Mushroom!"" whenever she had the chance.

"Herr Kesselmeyer kam als Hausfreund unangemeldet, ohne Hut und Paletot in die Stube und blieb an der Türe stehen. Sein Äußeres entsprach durchaus der Beschreibung, die Tony in einem Briefe an ihre Mutter davon gemacht hatte. Er war von leicht untersetzter Gestalt und weder dick noch dünn. Er trug einen schwarzen und schon etwas blanken Rock, ebensolche Beinkleider, die eng und kurz waren und eine weiße Weste, auf der sich eine lange dünne Uhrkette mit zwei oder drei Kneiferschnüren kreuzte. Von seinem roten Gesicht hob sich scharf der geschorene weiße Backenbart ab, der die Wangen bedeckte und Kinn und Lippen frei ließ. Sein Mund war klein, beweglich, drollig und enthielt lediglich im Unterkiefer zwei Zähne. Während Herr Kesselmeyer, die Hände in seinen senkrechten Hosentaschen vergraben, konfus, abwesend und nachdenklich stehenblieb, setzte er diese beiden gelben, kegelförmigen Eckzähne auf die Oberlippe. Die weißen und schwarzen Flaumfedern auf seinem Kopfe flatterten leise, obgleich nicht der geringste Lufthauch fühlbar war.","Herr Kesselmeyer came into the room unannounced as a friend of the house, without a hat or a palet and remained standing at the door. His appearance fitted the description Tony had given of it in a letter to her mother. He was slightly stocky and neither fat nor thin. He was wearing a black coat that was already a little shiny, the same kind of trousers that were tight and short, and a white waistcoat on which a long, thin watch chain crossed two or three pincheye cords. The clipped white whiskers, which covered his cheeks and left chin and lips exposed, stood out sharply from his red face. Its mouth was small, mobile, funny, and contained only two teeth in the lower jaw. While Herr Kesselmeyer stood, confused, absent-minded and thoughtful, with his hands buried in his vertical trouser pockets, he set those two yellow, cone-shaped canine teeth on his upper lip. The white and black downy feathers on his head fluttered softly, although not the slightest breath of air could be felt.","AS A FRIEND of the family, Herr Kesselmeyer entered the house unannounced, and stood now without coat and hat at the dining-room door. He looked exactly the way Tony had described him in her letter to her mother. He was rather short and square-built, neither fat nor thin. He wore a black coat, slightly shiny with wear, matching short, tight trousers, and a white vest across which hung a thin watch chain with two or three dangling cords for his pince-nez. His white, close-cropped beard stood out against his red face, but his upper lip was clean-shaven, revealing a small, comical, and mobile mouth, with only two teeth left in his lower jaw. Herr Kesselmeyer stood there somewhat confused, his hands buried in his pockets, musing absent-mindedly, his two yellow cone-shaped canines pressed to his upper lip. The salt-and-pepper down on his head fluttered softly, although there was not the slightest draft.","HERR KESSELMEYER entered unannounced, as a friend of the house, without hat or coat. He paused, however, near the door. His looks corresponded exactly to the description Tony had given to her Mother. He was slightly thick-set as to figure, but neither fat nor lean. He wore a black, already some-what shiny coat, short tight trousers of the same material, and a white waistcoat, over which went a long thin watch-chain and two or three eye-glass cords. His clipped white beard was in sharp contrast with his red face. It covered his cheeks and left his chin and lips free. His mogith was small and mobile, with two yellowish pointed teeth in the otherwise vacant gum of his lower jaw, and he was pressing these into his upper lip, aa-he stood absently by the door with his hands in his trousers pockets and the black and white down on his head waving slightly, although there was not the least perceptible draught."

The master of the house hastened to reply: ""I beg you gentlemen...""","“Shall we get down to business?” the consul remarked, turning from one to the other.

"Hierauf antwortete Christian nicht, sondern fuhr langsam mit der Hand über sein schon spärliches rötlichblondes Haar und ließ, einen unruhigen Ernst auf dem Gesichte, seine Augen haltlos und abwesend umherschweifen. Ohne Zweifel beschäftigte er sich noch mit dem, was er zuletzt gesagt hatte. Es herrschte eine Pause. Thomas schritt in stiller Verzweiflung daher.","To this Christian did not answer, but slowly ran his hand over his already sparse reddish-blond hair and, with an uneasy seriousness on his face, let his eyes wander absently and unsteadily. No doubt he was still dealing with what he had last said. There was a pause. Thomas walked in quiet desperation.","Christian offered no response to this, except that he slowly ran his hand through his thinning reddish-blond hair and his face turned serious and anxious, his eyes drifting about absent-mindedly, seeing nothing. He was doubtless still preoccupied with what he himself had last said. There was a long pause. Thomas stalked away in silent desperation.","Christian did not answer, except to run his hand slowly over his sparse red-brown locks, while his eyes roamed un-steadily and absently, and unrest sat upon his fare. Un-doubtedly he was still busy with the idea which he had just been expressing. There was a pause. Thomas stalked along with the calm-ness of despair."
"Thomas Buddenbrook verließ das Kontor und eilte die Haupttreppe hinan. Droben am Eingang zum Salon verweilte er eine halbe Minute vorm Spiegel, ordnete seine Krawatte und sog einen Augenblick den Eau-de-Cologne-Duft seines Taschentuches ein. Er war bleich, obgleich sein Körper sich in Transpiration befand; seine Hände und Füße aber waren kalt. Die Empfänge im Kontor hatten ihn beinahe schon abgenutzt … Er atmete auf und trat ein, um in dem von Sonnenlicht erfüllten Gemach den Konsul Huneus, Holzgroßhändler und fünffacher Millionär, seine Gemahlin, ihre Tochter und deren Gatten, Herrn Senator Doktor Gieseke, zu begrüßen. Die Herrschaften waren zusammen von Travemünde hereingekommen, woselbst sie, wie mehrere der ersten Familien, die nur dem Buddenbrookschen Geschäftsjubiläum zu Ehren ihre Badekur unterbrachen, den Juli verbrachten.","Thomas Buddenbrook left the office and hurried up the main staircase. Up at the entrance to the salon he lingered half a minute in front of the mirror, straightened his tie and inhaled the eau de cologne scent of his handkerchief for a moment. He was pale, although his body was perspiring; but his hands and feet were cold. The receptions in the office had almost worn him out... He breathed a sigh of relief and entered the sunlight-filled room to greet Consul Huneus, timber wholesaler and fivefold millionaire, his wife, their daughter and her husband, Senator Doctor Gieseke. The gentlemen had come in together from Travemünde, where they spent July, like several of the first families who only interrupted their spa treatment to honor Buddenbrook's business anniversary.","Thomas Buddenbrook left his office and hurried up the stairs. At the entrance to the salon he stopped at the mirror for half a minute to set his tie straight and to take a whiff of eau de cologne from his scented handkerchief. He looked pale—even though his whole body was perspiring, his hands and feet were cold. Receiving all those guests in his office had almost completely drained him. He took a deep breath and entered the sun-drenched room to greet Consul Huneus—whose wholesale lumber business had made him a millionaire five times over—his wife, their daughter, and her husband, Senator Andreas Gieseke. Like many of the town’s first families, these ladies and gentlemen had interrupted their July vacation in Travemünde and returned to town for the express purpose of celebrating the Buddenbrook anniversary.","Thomas Buddenbrook left his office and hurried upstairs. At the door of the salnn he paused a moment for a glance into the mirror to order his cravat, and to refresh himself with a whiff of the eau-de-cologne on his handkerchief. His body was wet with perspiration, but his face was pale, his hands and feet cnld. The reception in the offire had nearly used him up already. He drew a lono; breath and entered the sunlit room, to be greeted at once by Consul Hunrus, the lumber dealer and multi-millionaire, his wife, their daughter, and the lattpr's husband, Senator Dr. Girseke. These had all driven in from Travemiinde, like many others of the first families of the town, who were spending July in a rure which they interrupted only for the Buddenbrook jubilee."

"Ja, München gefällt mir ganz ausnehmend. Die Luft soll sehr nervenstärkend sein, und mit meinem Magen ist es im Augenblick ganz in Ordnung. Ich trinke mit großem Vergnügen sehr viel Bier, um so mehr, als das Wasser nicht ganz gesund ist; aber an das Essen kann ich mich noch nicht recht gewöhnen. Es gibt zuwenig Gemüse und zuviel Mehl, zum Beispiel in den Soßen, deren sich Gott erbarmen möge. Was ein ordentlicher Kalbsrücken ist, das ahnt man hier gar nicht, denn die Schlachter zerschneiden alles aufs jämmerlichste. Und mir fehlen sehr die Fische. Und dann ist es doch ein Wahnsinn, beständig Gurken- und Kartoffelsalat mit Bier durcheinander zu schlucken! Mein Magen gibt Töne von sich dabei.","Yes, I really like Munich. The air is said to be very nerve-wracking and my stomach is fine at the moment. I drink a great deal of beer with great pleasure, especially since the water is not entirely healthy; but I can't really get used to the food yet. There are too few vegetables and too much flour, for example in the sauces, on which may God have mercy. No one here has any idea what a proper saddle of veal is, because the butchers cut everything up in the most pathetic way. And I really miss the fish. And then it's crazy to constantly swallow cucumber and potato salad mixed with beer! My stomach makes noises.","Yes, I am quite taken by Munich. The air here is said to be good for the nerves, and my digestion is doing quite nicely at the moment.

The people here haven’t the vaguest what a good loin of veal is, because the butchers hack everything into pathetic little pieces. And I miss fish very much. And it really is purest madness, these everlasting pickles and potato salad, all washed down with beer—the sounds that come from my stomach!","Yes, I like Munich extremely. The air is very strengthening to the nerves, and for the moment I am quite in order with my stomach trouble. I enjoy drinking the beer--I drink a good deal, the more so as the water is not very good.

"Im Grunde jedoch war es nicht sowohl Konsul Buddenbrook selbst, dessen Persönlichkeit das Innere des Herrn Gosch in Flammen setzte, als vielmehr die junge Frau Konsulin, geborene Arnoldsen. Nicht als ob der Makler jemals ein Wort mit ihr gewechselt hätte. Er gehörte nicht zu dem Kreise der reichen Kaufleute, speiste nicht an ihren Tafeln und tauschte nicht Visiten mit ihnen. Aber, wie schon erwähnt, Gerda Buddenbrook war nicht sobald in der Stadt erschienen, als der immer sehnsüchtig nach Außerordentlichem schweifende Blick des finsteren Maklers sie auch schon erspäht hatte. Mit sicherem Instinkte hatte er alsbald erkannt, daß diese Erscheinung geeignet sei, seinem unbefriedigten Dasein ein wenig mehr Inhalt zu verleihen, und mit Leib und Seele hatte er sich ihr, die ihn kaum dem Namen nach kannte, als Sklave ergeben. Seitdem umkreiste er in Gedanken diese nervöse und aufs äußerste reservierte Dame, der niemand ihn vorstellte, wie der Tiger den Bändiger: mit demselben verbissenen Mienenspiel, derselben tückisch-demütigen Haltung, in der er auf der Straße, ohne daß sie das erwartet hätte, seinen Jesuitenhut vor ihr zog … Diese Welt der Mittelmäßigkeit bot ihm keine Möglichkeit, für diese Frau eine Tat von gräßlicher Ruchlosigkeit zu begehen, welche er, bucklig, düster und kalt in seinen Mantel gehüllt, mit teuflischem Gleichmut verantwortet haben würde! Ihre langweiligen Gewohnheiten gestatteten ihm nicht, diese Frau durch Mord, Verbrechen und blutige Listen auf einen Kaiserthron zu erhöhen. Nichts ließ sie ihm übrig, als im Rathause für die Wahl ihres ingrimmig verehrten Gatten zu stimmen und ihr, vielleicht, dereinst, die Übersetzung von Lope de Vegas sämtlichen Dramen zu widmen.","Basically, however, it was not so much Consul Buddenbrook himself, whose personality set Herr Gosch on fire, but rather the young woman Consul, née Arnoldsen. Not that the agent ever exchanged a word with her. He did not belong to the circle of rich merchants, did not dine at their tables and did not exchange visits with them. But, as already mentioned, Gerda Buddenbrook had not appeared in town as soon as the sinister broker's gaze, always longing for the extraordinary, had spotted her. With a sure instinct he had recognized at once that this appearance was apt to give his unsatisfied existence a little more content, and he had given himself up body and soul as a slave to her, who hardly knew him by name. Since then his thoughts have circled around this nervous and extremely reserved lady, to whom no one introduced him, like a tiger does the tamer: with the same grim expression, the same treacherous, humble demeanor with which, without her expecting it, he showed his in the street Jesuit hat in front of her... This world of mediocrity gave him no chance of committing an act of hideous impiety for that woman, for which, hunchbacked, gloomy, and coldly wrapped in his cloak, he would have answered with devilish indifference! Her tedious habits would not allow him to elevate this woman to an imperial throne through murder, crime, and bloody subterfuges. She left him nothing but to vote in the town hall for the election of her fiercely revered husband and, perhaps some day, to dedicate to her the translation of all the dramas of Lope de Vegas.","Ultimately, however, it was not so much Consul Buddenbrook himself and his personality that set Herr Gosch ’s passions afire, as it was the young Madame Buddenbrook, née Arnoldsen. Not that the broker had ever exchanged so much as one word with her. He did not belong to the circle of rich merchants, did not dine at their tables or visit back and forth with them. But, as was noted earlier, Gerda Buddenbrook had no sooner appeared in town than she was spotted by the gloomy broker, whose roving eye was ever on the lookout for something extraordinary. With unerring instinct, he realized at once that this was a presence, a vision, aptly suited to give some meaning to his unfulfilled life, and although she barely knew him by name, he made himself her slave, body and soul. And from that moment on, like a tiger circling its tamer, his thoughts had circled around this high-strung and highly reserved lady, to whom he had never been introduced; if he chanced to meet her on the street he would, to her great surprise, doff his Jesuit hat and strike the cunning, fawning pose of a tiger, while bestial savagery played across his face. This world of mediocre men offered him no hope of committing some gruesome, ruthless deed in honor of his lady—but had he been called to account for it, he would have wrapped his hunchbacked body in his cape and stared them all down with gloomy cold indifference. But their boring conventions would never allow him to raise her to an imperial throne by committing murder and other foul, bloody crimes. All he could do was cast his vote in the town hall for her husband in token of his fierce respect, and perhaps, one day, to dedicate to her his translation of Lope de Vega’s complete works.","But at bottom it was not so much Consul Buddenbrook himself whose personality fired Gosch's soul to its innermost depths. It was rather the young Frau Consul, Gerda Arnoldsen. Not that the broker had ever exchanged a word 19 with her. He did not belong to her circle of wealthy merchant families, nor sit at their, tables, nor pay visits to them. But, as we have seen, Gerda Buddenbrook had but tu arrive in the town to be singled out by the roving fancy of the sinister broker, ever on the look-out for the unusual. With unerring instinct he divined that this figure was cal- culated to add content to his unsatisfied existence, and he made himself the slave of one who had scarcely ever heard his name. Since then he encompassed in his reveries this nervous, exceedingly reserved lady, to whom he had not even been presented: he lifted his Jesuit hat to her, on the street, to her great surprise, and treated her to a pantomime of cringing treachery, gloating over her the while in his thoughts as a tiger might over his trainer. This dull existence would afford him no chance of committing atrocities for this woman's sake--ah, if it only would, with what devilish indifference would he answer for them! Its stupid conventions prevented him from raising her, by deeds of blood and horror, to an imperial throne!--And thus, nothing was left but for him to go to the Town Hall and cast his vote in favour of her furiously respected husband--and , per- haps, one day, to dedicate to her his forthcoming transition of Lope de Vega."

"Ja, als Entschädigung und Belohnung für einen Besuch bei Herrn Brecht hatte Hanno kürzlich zum ersten Male das Theater besucht, das Stadttheater, wo er im ersten Range an der Seite seiner Mutter atemlos den Klängen und Vorgängen des »Fidelio« hatte folgen dürfen. Seitdem träumte er nichts als Opernszenen, und eine Leidenschaft für die Bühne erfüllte ihn, die ihn kaum schlafen ließ. Mit unaussprechlichem Neide betrachtete er auf der Straße die Leute, die, wie ja auch sein Onkel Christian, als Theaterhabitués bekannt waren, Konsul Döhlmann, Makler Gosch … War das Glück ertragbar, wie sie fast jeden Abend dort anwesend sein zu dürfen? Könnte er nur einmal in der Woche vor Beginn der Aufführung einen Blick in den Saal tun, das Stimmen der Instrumente hören und ein wenig den geschlossenen Vorhang ansehen! Denn er liebte alles im Theater: den Gasgeruch, die Sitze, die Musiker, den Vorhang …","Yes, as compensation and reward for a visit to Herr Brecht, Hanno had recently gone to the theater for the first time, the Stadttheater, where he had been able to breathlessly follow the sounds and events of Fidelio in the first rank at his mother's side. From then on he dreamed of nothing but opera scenes, and he was filled with a passion for the stage that hardly let him sleep. With unspeakable envy he looked at the people on the street who, like his uncle Christian, were known as theater habitués, Consul Döhlmann, broker Gosch ... Was the luck bearable to be able to be there almost every evening like them? If only he could peek into the hall once a week before the start of the performance, hear the instruments being played and take a look at the closed curtain! Because he loved everything in the theater: the smell of gas, the seats, the musicians, the curtain...","As a reward, as a kind of compensation, for a visit to Herr Brecht, Hanno had recently been taken to the theater for the first time—the municipal theater, where from the first tier, right beside his mother, he had breathlessly followed the music and action of Fidelio. And since then, overcome with a passion for the stage, he had dreamed of nothing but opera scenes, had barely been able to sleep. When he met people on the street who, like his Uncle Christian, were known to be regular theater goers—Consul Döhlmann or Gosch the broker, for instance—he felt indescribably jealous. How could anyone bear the happiness of attending the theater almost every evening? If only he could go just once a week, sit there in the hall before the performance, listen to the instruments tune up, and gaze for a while at the closed curtain. Because he loved everything about the theater: the smell of gas lamps, the seats, the musicians, even the curtain.","He had been taken to the opera as compensation lor a particularly painful visit to Herr Brncht; sitting beside his mother, in the dress circle, he had followed breathless a per-formance of Fidelia, and since that time he had heard nothing, seen nothing, thought of nothing but opera, and a passion for the theatre filled him and almost kept him sleep-less. He looked enviously at people like Uncle Christian, who was known as a regular frequenter and might go every night if he liked: Consul Dohlmann, Cosch the broker--how could they endure the joy of seeing it every night? He himself would ask no more than to look once a week into the hall, before the performance: hear the voices of the instruments being tuned, and gaze for a while at the curtain! For he loved it all, the seats, the musicians, the drop-curtain--even the smell of gas."

"Sie befand sich in bester Laune, wie gesagt, und erzählte Donnerstags, wenn Konsul Buddenbrooks und die Damen Buddenbrook aus der Breitenstraße, Konsul Krögers, Klothilde und Sesemi Weichbrodt mit Erika zu Tische kamen, aufs anschaulichste von München, von dem Biere, den Dampfnudeln, dem Kunstmaler, der sie hatte porträtieren wollen, und den Hofequipagen, die ihr den größten Eindruck gemacht hatten. Sie erwähnte im Vorübergehen auch des Herrn Permaneder, und gesetzt den Fall, daß Pfiffi Buddenbrook eine oder die andere Bemerkung darüber fallen ließ, daß so eine Reise ja recht angenehm sei, daß jedoch irgendein praktischer Erfolg sich nicht scheine eingestellt zu haben, so überhörte Frau Grünlich das mit einer unsäglichen Würde, indem sie den Kopf zurücklegte und trotzdem das Kinn auf die Brust zu drücken suchte …","She was in the best of moods, as I said, and on Thursdays, when Consul Buddenbrooks and the ladies Buddenbrooks from Breitenstrasse, Consul Krögers, Klothilde and Sesemi Weichbrodt came to dinner with Erika, she would talk most vividly about Munich, about the beer, the Dampfnudeln, the painter who had wanted to portray her, and the court equipage who had made the greatest impression on her.

She would also mention Herr Permaneder in passing, and if Pfiffi Buddenbrook or one of the others made some remark to the effect that such a journey was quite pleasant, of course, but that apparently it had resulted in nothing of practical consequence, Frau Grünlich would pass this over with unutterable dignity, laying her head back and yet somehow managing to tuck her chin against her chest.","She was in the best of tempers. On Thursday, when Consul Buddenbrook and the ladies from Broad Street, Consul Kriiger, Clothilde, Sesemi Wiechbrodt and Erica came to tea, she talked vividly about Munich.

She mentioned Herr Permaneder in passing; and Pfiffi Buddenbrook let fall a word or two to the effect that such a journey might be very agreeable, but did not seem to have any practical results. Frau Gr�nlich passed this by with dignity, though she put back her head and tucked in her chin."
"Dies alles war der hauptsächlichste Inhalt der Geständnisse, die Madame Permaneder in die Kleiderfalten ihrer Mutter hinein verlauten ließ.

"Das nahm eine lange Zeit in Anspruch, denn das Angebot von 28000 Talern Kurant, das Herr Gosch gemacht hatte, schien dem Senator zu niedrig, während der Makler sich zur Hölle verschwur, wenn dieser Summe auch nur einen Silbergroschen hinzuzufügen nicht eine Tat des Wahnwitzes wäre. Thomas Buddenbrook sprach von der zentralen Lage und dem ungewöhnlichen Umfange des Grundstückes, aber Herr Gosch hielt mit zischender, gepreßter und verbissener Stimme, verzerrten Lippen und grauenerregenden Gesten einen Vortrag über das erdrückende Risiko, das er übernähme, eine Explikation, die in ihrer lebensvollen Eindringlichkeit beinahe ein Gedicht zu nennen war … Ha! Wann, an wen, für wieviel er dieses Haus wohl wieder würde absetzen können? Wie oft im Rollen der Jahrhunderte denn eine Nachfrage nach einem solchen Grundstück laut würde? Ob sein hochverehrter Freund und Gönner ihm etwa versprechen könne, daß morgen mit dem Zuge von Büchen ein Nabob aus Indien eintreffen werde, um sich im Buddenbrookschen Hause einzurichten?

Thomas Buddenbrook spoke of the central location and the unusual size of the property, but Herr Gosch delivered a hissing, strained and grim voice, distorted lips and horrifying gestures, about the crushing risk he was taking, an explication that in its lively poignancy to almost call it a poem was... Ha! When, to whom, for how much would he be able to sell this house again? How often in the course of the centuries would there be a demand for such a piece of land? Could his esteemed friend and benefactor promise him that a nabob from India would arrive tomorrow with the Büchen train to set up home in the Buddenbrooks? He - Sigismund Gosch - will remain seated with it ... he will remain seated with it, and then he will be a defeated, a finally destroyed person who will no longer have the time to get up, because his clock has expired, his grave has been dug, dug be it … And since this phrase captivated him, he added something about trembling lemurs and clods of earth falling dully on the coffin lid.","This took quite a long time, because Herr Gosch’s offer of twenty-eight thousand thalers courant seemed too low to the senator, whereas the broker said that to ask even one silver penny more would be an act of pure madness—damned if it wouldn’t. Thomas Buddenbrook spoke of the central location and the unusually large lot; but, contorting his lips and hissing in a savage, choked voice, Herr Gosch now gave him a little lecture, punctuated by horrible gesticulations, about the crushing risk he would be taking—an explanation so trenchant and vivid that it was almost a poem. Aha!—When, to whom, and for how much would he ever be able to resell the house? How often over the course of centuries did a cry go up for such a lot? Could his honored friend and patron promise him, perhaps, that the next morning a nabob would arrive on the train from Büchen whose express wish was to set up house in the Buddenbrook family home? He—Siegismund Gosch—would be stuck with it—would be stuck with it, leaving him a beaten man, a man ruined for life, never to rise again , his clock run out, his grave dug—dug deep. And this phrase so captured him that he added something about shuffling wraiths and clods of earth falling with a dull thud upon his coffin.","It took a long time. The offer of twenty-eight thousand thaler made by Herr G-osch seemed too low to the Senator, and the broker called heaven to witness that it would be an act of madness to add a single groschen to the sum.

He waxed almost poetic. Ha! Could his honoured friend tell him when, to whom, for how much, he would be able to get rid of the house again? How often, in the course of the century, would there be a demand for such a house? Perhaps his friend and patron could assure him that to-morrow, on the train from Buchen, there was arriving an Indian nabob who wished to establish himself in the Buddenbrook mansion? He, Siegismund Gosch, would have it on his hands, simply on his hands, and it would be the 197 ruin of him.

"Manchmal fand der Unterricht in Herrn Pfühls Hause statt, einem geräumigen alten Giebelhause mit vielen kühlen Gängen und Winkeln, das der Organist ganz allein mit einer alten Wirtschafterin bewohnte. Manchmal auch, am Sonntag, durfte der kleine Buddenbrook dem Gottesdienst in der Marienkirche droben an der Orgel beiwohnen, und das war etwas anderes als unten mit den anderen Leuten im Schiff zu sitzen. Hoch über der Gemeinde, hoch noch über Pastor Pringsheim auf seiner Kanzel saßen die beiden inmitten des Brausens der gewaltigen Klangmassen, die sie gemeinsam entfesselten und beherrschten, denn mit glückseligem Eifer und Stolz durfte Hanno seinem Lehrer manchmal beim Handhaben der Register behilflich sein. Wenn aber das Nachspiel zum Chorgesang zu Ende war, wenn Herr Pfühl langsam alle Finger von den Tasten gelöst hatte und nur den Grund- und Baßton noch leise und feierlich hatte verhallen lassen – wenn dann nach einer stimmungsvollen Kunstpause unter dem Schalldeckel der Kanzel Pastor Pringsheims modulierende Stimme hervorzudringen begann, so geschah es gar nicht selten, daß Herr Pfühl ganz einfach sich über die Predigt zu mokieren, über Pastor Pringsheims stilisiertes Fränkisch, seine langen, dunklen oder scharf akzentuierten Vokale, seine Seufzer und den jähen Wechsel zwischen Finsternis und Verklärung auf seinem Angesicht zu lachen anfing. Dann lachte auch Hanno, leise und tiefbelustigt, denn ohne sich anzusehen und ohne es sich zu sagen, waren die beiden dort oben der Ansicht, daß diese Predigt ein ziemlich albernes Geschwätz und der eigentliche Gottesdienst vielmehr das sei, was der Pastor und seine Gemeinde wohl nur für eine Beigabe zur Erhöhung der Andacht hielten: nämlich die Musik.","Sometimes the lessons took place in Herr Pfühl's house, a spacious old gabled house with many cool corridors and corners, in which the organist lived alone with an old housekeeper. Sometimes too, on Sundays, little Buddenbrook was allowed to attend the service in the Marienkirche upstairs at the organ, and that was different from sitting down with the other people in the ship. High above the congregation, high even above Pastor Pringsheim in his pulpit, the two sat in the midst of the roar of the mighty masses of sound that they unleashed and mastered together, because with blissful eagerness and pride Hanno was sometimes allowed to help his teacher with the handling of the stops. But when the postlude to the choral singing was over, when Mr. Pfühl had slowly released all his fingers from the keys and had only let the fundamental and bass tones fade away quietly and solemnly - when then, after an atmospheric art break under the soundboard of the pulpit, Pastor Pringsheim's modulating voice began to emerge, it was not uncommon for Herr Pfühl to simply mock the sermon, Pastor Pringsheim's stylized Franconian, his long, dark or sharply accented vowels, his sighs and the abrupt alternation between darkness and transfiguration in his face started to laugh. Then Hanno laughed too, softly and deeply amused, because without looking at each other and without saying it to each other, the two up there were of the opinion that this sermon was pretty silly gossip and that the actual service was what the pastor and his congregation were supposed to do only considered an addition to increase devotion: namely the music.","Sometimes the lessons took place in Herr Pfühl’s house, a roomy old gabled affair with all sorts of cool hallways and nooks, where the organist lived all by himself except for an ancient housekeeper. Sometimes little Johann Buddenbrook was allowed to join him up in the organ loft of St. Mary’s for Sunday services, and that was something very different from sitting down in the nave with all the others. High above the congregation, high even above Pastor Pringsheim in his pulpit, the two of them sat amid the surge of massive waves of sound, which together they unleashed and commanded—because sometimes, much to his great happiness and pride, Hanno was permitted to help his teacher in setting the stops. But once the postlude to the choral anthem was over and Herr Pfühl had slowly removed all ten fingers from the keys to let the bass of the tonic chord echo softly and solemnly, there would be a meaningful, artful pause, and then Pastor Pringsheim would lift up his voice from beneath the canopy of the pulpit; and at that point, it was not unusual for Herr Pfühl to start mocking the sermon and to laugh at Pastor Pringsheim’s stylized Franconian accent, his long and dark or sharply accented vowels, his sighs, and the abrupt shifts of darkness and transfiguration passing over his face. Then Hanno would laugh, too, in quiet, deep amusement; for, without even looking at one another or saying a word as they sat there high above it all, they were united in the opinion that his sermons were rather foolish babble and that the real worship service was something that the pastor and his congregation probably thought of as a mere adjunct for elevating the mood of devotion—and that something was music.","The lessons sometimes took place at Herr Pfiihl's own house, a roomy old gabled dwelling full of cool passages and crannies, in which the organist lived alone with an elderly housekeeper. Sometimes, too, little Buddenbrook was allowed to sit up with the organist at the Sunday service in St. Mary's--which was quite a different matter from stopping below with the other people, in the nave. High above the congregation, high above Pastor Pringsheim in his pulpit, the two sat alone, in the midst of a mighty tempest of rolling sound, which at once set them free from the earth and dominated them by its own power; and Hanno was sometimes blissfully permitted to help his master control the stops. When the choral was finished, Herr Pfiihl would slowly lift his fingers from the keyboard, so that only the bass and the fundamental would still be heard, in lingering solemnity; and after a meaningful pause, the well-modulated voice of Pastor Pringsheim would rise up from under the sounding-board in the pulpit. Then it happened not infrequently that Herr Pfiihl would, quite simply, begin to make fun of the preacher: his artificial enunciation, his long, exaggerated vowels, his sighs, his crude transitions from sanctity to gloom. Hanno would laugh too, softly but with heart-felt glee; for those two up there were both of the opinion--which neither of them expressed--that the sermon was silly twaddle, and that the real service consisted in that which the Pastor and his congregation regarded merely as a devotional accessory: namely, the music."
"Sie küßten ihre Mutter und durften rasch noch einmal behutsam hinter die grünseidne Gardine blicken, worauf sie mit dem Vater, der seinen Pelerinenmantel übergeworfen und das Gesangbuch zur Hand genommen hatte, schweigend und ruhigen Schrittes zur Kirche zogen, gefolgt von dem durchdringenden Geschrei des neuen Familiengliedes, das plötzlich erwacht war …","They kissed their mother and were allowed to peek cautiously behind the green silk curtains, whereupon they and their father, who had thrown on his cape coat and picked up the hymnal, walked silently and calmly to the church, followed by the piercing screams of the new member of the family that suddenly woke up...","They kissed their mother and were permitted one cautious peek behind the green silk curtains, and then, together with their father, who had thrown on his cape and picked up his hymnal, they quietly set out for church, the Sunday calm broken only by piercing cries from the newest member of the family, who had suddenly awakened.","They kissed their mother, and were allowed a peep under the green curtains of the baby's bed.

"Eines Sonntags, als sie mit den Eltern und Geschwistern in der Marienkirche saß, redete Pastor Kölling in starken Worten über den Text, der da besagt, daß das Weib Vater und Mutter verlassen und dem Manne nachfolgen soll – wobei er plötzlich ausfallend wurde. Tony starrte entsetzt zu ihm empor, ob er sie vielleicht sogar ansähe … Nein, Gott sei Dank, er hielt seinen dicken Kopf nach einer anderen Seite gewandt und predigte nur im allgemeinen über die andächtige Menge hin; und dennoch war es nur allzu klar, daß dies ein neuer Angriff auf sie war und jedes Wort ihr galt. Ein jugendliches, ein noch kindliches Weib, verkündete er, das noch keinen eigenen Willen und keine eigene Einsicht besitze und dennoch den liebevollen Ratschlüssen der Eltern sich widersetze, das sei strafbar, das wolle der Herr ausspeien aus seinem Munde … und bei dieser Wendung, welche zu denen gehörte, für die Pastor Kölling schwärmte und die er mit Begeisterung hervorbrachte, traf Tony dennoch ein durchdringender Blick aus seinen Augen, der von einer furchtbaren Armbewegung begleitet war … Tony sah, wie ihr Vater neben ihr eine Hand erhob, als wollte er sagen: »So! nicht zu heftig …« Aber es war kein Zweifel, daß Pastor Kölling von ihm oder der Mutter ins Einverständnis gezogen war. Rot und gebückt saß sie an ihrem Platze, mit dem Gefühle, daß die Augen aller Welt auf ihr ruhten – und am nächsten Sonntage weigerte sie sich aufs bestimmteste, die Kirche zu besuchen.","One Sunday, as she was sitting with her parents and siblings in St. Mary's Church, Pastor Kölling spoke in strong terms about the text that says that the woman should leave her father and mother and follow the man - and he suddenly became abusive. Tony stared up at him, horrified, wondering if he might even be looking at her... No, thank God, he turned his stout head the other way, preaching only generally to the devout crowd; and yet it was only too clear that this was a new attack on her, and that every word was meant for her. A youthful, still childlike woman, he announced, who still has no will of her own and no insight of her own and yet defies the loving advice of her parents, that is punishable, the Lord wants to spit it out of his mouth ... and with this turn of phrase, which one belonged to those that Pastor Kölling adored and that he produced with enthusiasm, Tony nevertheless got a piercing look from his eyes, which was accompanied by a terrible movement of the arm... Tony saw her father raise a hand beside her as if to say : »So! not too violently...' But there was no doubt that Pastor Kolling had obtained his or his mother's consent. Red and hunched over, she sat in her place, with the feeling that the eyes of all the world were on her - and the next Sunday she emphatically refused to go to church.","One Sunday, as she was sitting in St. Mary’s with her parents and brothers, Pastor Kölling expanded in strong words on a text that said that a woman should leave father and mother and cleave to her husband—and suddenly became so emphatic that Tony stared up at him in alarm to see if he might be looking at her. But no, thank God, his head was turned in the other direction and he was just preaching away in general across the throng of worshipers; and yet it was only too clear that this was a new assault and that every word was meant for her. For a young woman, a mere child who as yet had neither will nor wisdom of her own, to oppose the loving advice of her parents was an offense such as the Lord would spew from His mouth—and at this last phrase, one of those that Pastor Kölling greatly admired and used with enthusiasm, Tony saw him make a dreadful sweep of his arm and turn to look right through her. Tony saw her father, who was sitting next to her, raise one hand, as if to say, “Not so rough …” But there was no doubt that Pastor Kölling was in collusion with him or her mother. She turned red and cowered in her seat, feeling as if every eye were watching her. The next Sunday, she flatly refused to go to church.","One Sunday, as she sat in St. Mary's with her parents and brothers, Pastor K�lling began preaching from the text about the wife leaving father and mother and cleaving only to her husband. His language was so violent that she began listening wilh a jump, staring up to see if he were looking at her. No, thank goodness, his head was turned in the other direction, and he seemed to be preaching in general to all the faithful. Still, it was plain that this was a new attack upon her, --every word struck home. A young, a still childish girl, he said, could have as yet no will and no wisdom; and if she set herself up against the loving advice of her parents she was as deserving of punishment as the guilty are; she was one of those whom the Lord spews out of his mouth. With this phrase, which the kind Pastor Rolling adored, she encoun-tered a piercing glance from his eyes, as he made a threatening gesture with his right arm. Tony saw how her Father, sitting next to her,, raised his hand, as though he would say, ""Not so hard."" But it was perfectly plain that either he or her Mother had let the Pastor into the secret. Tony crouched in her place with her face like fire, and felt the eyes of all the world upon her. Next Sunday she flatly refused to go to church."

Am Sonntagvormittag klingelten lauter kleine Volksschulmädchen in der Mengstraße, und Stine Voß, die an der Mauer, und Mike Stuht, die in der Glockengießerstraße, und Fike Snut, die an der Trave oder in der Kleinen Gröpelgrube oder im Engelswisch zu Hause waren, wanderten mit ihrem semmelblonden, mit Wasser gekämmtem Haar über die große Diele in das helle Gartenzimmer, dort hinten, das als Kontor seit längerer Zeit nicht mehr benutzt wurde, wo Sitzbänke aufgeschlagen waren und wo die Konsulin Buddenbrook, geborene Kröger, mit ihrem Kleid aus schwerem schwarzem Atlas, ihrem weißen, vornehmen Gesicht und ihrer noch weißeren Spitzenhaube, ihnen an einem Tischchen, auf welchem ein Glas Zuckerwasser stand, gegenübersaß und sie eine Stunde lang katechisierte.","The consul herself, however, asked far more of herself than of her children. For example, she set up a Sunday school. On Sunday morning, lots of little elementary school girls rang the bell in Mengstrasse, and Stine Voss, who lived near the Wall, and Mike Stuht, who lived in Glockengiesserstrasse, and Fike Snut, who lived on the Trave or in Kleine Gröpelgrube or Engelswisch, went with them her blond hair, combed with water, across the large hallway into the bright garden room, back there, which had not been used as an office for a long time, where benches had been put up and where the Consul Buddenbrook, née Kröger, with her dress made of heavy black satin , her white, noble face and her even whiter lace cap, sat opposite them at a small table on which stood a glass of sugar water and catechized them for an hour.","But Madame Buddenbrook demanded much more of herself than of her children. She founded a Sunday school, for example. On Sunday mornings, the doorbell on Meng Strasse was rung only by little grammar-school girls—by Stina Voss, who lived near the wall; or Mika Stuht, from Glockengiesser Strasse; and Fika Snut, from down by the river, or on Kleine Gröpel Grube, or on Engelswisch—it all depended. Their towheads tamed by water and comb, they paraded through the large entrance hall and into the brightly lit garden room, which had not been used as an office for some time and was now fitted out with benches facing a little table on which was placed a glass of sugar-water and behind which sat Madame Buddenbrook, née Kröger, in a dress of heavy black satin, her white, genteel face framed by an even whiter lace cap, who proceeded to catechize them for an hour.","But the Frau Consul made more demands upon herself than upon her children. She instituted a Sunday School, and on Sunday afternoon only little board-school pupils rang at the door of the house in Meng Street. Stine Voss, who lived by the city wall, and Mike Stuht from Bell-Founders' Street, and Fike Snut from the river-bank or Groping Alley, their straw-coloured locks smoothed back with a wet comb, crossed the entry into the garden-room, which for a long time now had not been used as an office, and in which rows of benches had been arranged and Frau Consul Buddenbrook, born Kroger, in a gown of heavy black satin, with her white re-fined face and still whiter lace cap, sat opposite to them at a little table with a glass of sugar-water and catechized thrm for an hour."
"Mit einem Worte: es war auf beiden Seiten viel guter Wille vorhanden, die Nachmittagsbesuche Direktor Weinschenks wiederholten sich in rascher Folge, und im Januar – dem Januar des Jahres 1867 – gestattete er sich, mit einigen kurzen, männlichen und geraden Worten um Erika Grünlichs Hand zu bitten.","In a word: there was a lot of goodwill on both sides, Director Weinschenk's afternoon visits were repeated in quick succession, and in January - January of the year 1867 - he allowed himself a few short, manly and straight words on Erika Grünlich's hand to ask.","In short, there was a great deal of good will on both sides. More afternoon visits by Herr Weinschenk followed in rapid succession, and in January, 1867, with a few brief, manly, and straightforward words, he made bold to ask for Erika Grünlich’s hand.","In a word, much good will was shown on both sides.

"Nun war der Reigen eröffnet. Die große, weiße Tür mit dem Relief von musizierenden Amoretten darüber blieb kaum einen Augenblick geschlossen und gewährte beständig den Ausblick auf das vom einfallenden Licht durchflutete Treppenhaus, sowie auf die Haupttreppe selbst, auf der sich unaufhörlich die Gäste herauf- und hinunterbewegten. Da aber der Salon geräumig war und die Gruppen, die sich bildeten, von Gesprächen zusammengehalten wurden, so waren die Kommenden weit zahlreicher als die Gehenden, und bald beschränkte man sich nicht mehr auf das Zimmer, sondern überhob das Dienstmädchen des Öffnens und Schließens der Tür, ließ sie offen und stand auch auf dem parkettierten Korridor beisammen. Schwirrendes und dröhnendes Gespräch von Damen- und Männerstimmen, Händeschütteln, Verbeugungen, Scherzworte und lautes, behagliches Lachen, das sich zwischen den Säulen des Treppenhauses emporschwingt und von der Decke, der großen Glasscheibe des »Einfallenden Lichtes«, widerhallt. Senator Buddenbrook nimmt bald zu Häupten der Treppe, bald drinnen an der Schwelle des Erkers ernst und formell gemurmelte oder kordial hervorgestoßene Glückwünsche entgegen. Bürgermeister Doktor Langhals, ein vornehm untersetzter Herr, der sein rasiertes Kinn in der weißen Binde birgt, mit kurzen, grauen Koteletts und müdem Diplomatenblick, wird mit allgemeiner Ehrerbietung empfangen. Der Weinhändler Konsul Eduard Kistenmaker nebst seiner Gattin, der geborenen Möllendorpf, sowie sein Bruder und Teilhaber Stephan, Senator Buddenbrooks treuester Anhänger und Freund, mit seiner Frau, einer außerordentlich gesunden Gutsbesitzerstochter, sind eingetroffen.

Konsul Hermann Hagenström hat für seinen schweren Körper eine Stütze am Treppengeländer gefunden und plaudert, während seine platt auf der Oberlippe liegende Nase ein wenig mühsam in den rötlichen Bart hineinatmet, mit Herrn Senator Doktor Cremer, dem Polizeichef, dessen braungrau melierter Backenbart sein mit einer gewissen milden Schlauheit lächelndes Gesicht umrahmt. Staatsanwalt Doktor Moritz Hagenström, dessen schöne Gattin, die geborene Puttfarken aus Hamburg, ebenfalls anwesend ist, zeigt irgendwo lächelnd seine spitzigen, lückenhaften Zähne. Einen Augenblick sieht man, wie der alte Doktor Grabow Senator Buddenbrooks Rechte zwischen seinen beiden Händen hält, um gleich darauf vom Baumeister Voigt verdrängt zu werden. Pastor Pringsheim, in bürgerlicher Kleidung und nur durch die Länge seines Gehrockes seine Würde andeutend, kommt mit ausgebreiteten Armen und gänzlich verklärtem Angesicht die Treppe herauf. Auch Friedrich Wilhelm Marcus ist zugegen. Diejenigen Herren, die irgendeine Körperschaft, den Senat, die Bürgerschaft, die Handelskammer repräsentieren, sind im Frack erschienen. – Halb zwölf Uhr.

The wine merchant Consul Eduard Kistenmaker and his wife, who was born Möllendorpf, and his brother and partner Stephan, Senator Buddenbrook's most loyal supporter and friend, have arrived with his wife, an extraordinarily healthy landowner's daughter. The widowed Senator Möllendorpf is enthroned in the living room in the middle of the sofa, while her children, Consul August Möllendorpf with his wife Julchen, née Hagenström, have just arrived, congratulated them and move through the assembly to say hello. Consul Hermann Hagenstrom has found support for his heavy body on the banister and is chatting, while his nose flat on his upper lip, breathing a little laboredly into his reddish beard, with Senator Doctor Cremer, the chief of police, whose mottled brown whiskers have a certain mild cunning framed smiling face. Prosecutor Doctor Moritz Hagenstrom, whose beautiful wife, née Puttfarken from Hamburg, is also present, shows his pointed, gapping teeth somewhere with a smile.

Pastor Pringsheim, dressed in middle-class clothes and showing his dignity only by the length of his frock coat, comes up the stairs with outstretched arms and a completely transfigured face. Friedrich Wilhelm Marcus is also present. Those gentlemen who represent any body, the senate, the citizenry, the chamber of commerce, appeared in tails. - Half past eleven.

The large white door, topped by the bas-relief of cupids playing instruments, seldom remained closed for more than a moment, so that there was an almost unbroken view of the stairwell flooded with light and of the stairway itself—an unending parade of guests moved up and down it. The salon was large enough, however, to accommodate little groups that formed for conversation, so that the number of arrivals was much greater than that of departures; and once the maid had given up trying to open and close the door and simply left it open, the guests spilled out into the parqueted corridor. Male and female voices buzz and hum in conversation, hands are shaken, bows and witticisms are exchanged, and loud, easy laughter is swept up among the columns of the stairway and echoes off the ceiling and the large glass pane of the skylight. Senator Buddenbrook takes up a position, now at the top of the stairs, now at the bay window, to receive all their good wishes—some murmured in serious and formal tones, some blurted cordially and heartily. Mayor Langhals, an elegant stout gentleman with short gray whiskers, the weary gaze of a diplomat, and a clean-shaven chin that he hides in a white cravat, is received with deference on all sides. Consul Eduard Kistenmaker the wine merchant and his wife, née Möllendorpf, along with his brother and partner, Stephen, Senator Buddenbrook’s most faithful supporter and friend, plus the latter’s wife, the extraordinarily healthy daughter of a gentleman farmer, all arrive together.

His flat nose drooping over his upper lip, Consul Hermann Hagenström has found support for his bulk on the banister and breathes rather heavily into his reddish beard as he chats with Senator Cremer, the chief of police, whose brown whiskers are flecked with gray and frame a smiling face that betrays a certain cunning. Dr. Moritz Hagenström the attorney is also in attendance, accompanied by his beautiful wife, the former Fräulein Puttfarken from Hamburg, and when he smiles some of his pointed gap-teeth show.

Even Friedrich Wilhelm Marcus is on hand. Those gentlemen who are official representatives of the senate, the assembly, or the Chamber of Commerce are all dressed in tails. Eleven-thirty—it is getting very hot. The lady of the house withdrew about fifteen minutes ago.","Now the ball was open. The tall white door, with the relief of the singing cupids above it, was scarcely closed for a moment; there wag a constant vinw from within of the great staircase, upon which the light streamed down from the sky-light far above, and of the stairs themselves, full of guests cither entering or taking their leave. But the- salon was spacious, the guests lingered in groups to talk, and the number of those who came was for some time far greater than the number of those who went away. Soon the maid-servant gave up opening and shutting the door that led into the salon and left it wide open, so that the guests stood in the corridor as well. There was the drone and buzz of conversation in 99 masculine and feminine voices, there were handshakings, bows, jests, and loud, jolly laughter, which reverberated among the columns of the staircase and echoed from the great glass panes of the skylight. Senator Buddenbrook stood by turns at the top of the stairs and in the bow-window, receiving the con- gratulations, which were sometimes mere formal murmurs and sometimes loud and hearty expressions of good will. Burgo- master Dr. Langhals, a heavily built man of elegant appear- ance, with a shaven chin nestling in a white neck-cloth, short grey mutton-chops, and a languid diplomatic air, was received with general marks of respect. Consul Eduard Kistenmaker the wine-merchant, his wife, who was a Mbllendorpf, and his brother and partner Stephan, Senator Buddenbrook's loyal friend and supporter, with his wife, the rudely healthy daughter of a landed proprietor, arrive and pay their respects. The widowed Frau Senator Mollendorpf sits throned in the centre of the sofa in the salon, while her children, Consul August Moll end orpf and his wife Julchen, born Hagenstrb'm, mingle with the crowd. Consul Hermann Hagenstrbm supports his considerable weight on the balustrade, breathes heavily into his red beard, and talks with Senator Dr. Cremer, the Chief of Police, whose brown beard, mixed with grey, frames a smiling face expressive of a sort of gentle slyness. State Attorney Moritz Hagenslrom, smiling and showing his defective teeth, is there with his beautiful wife, the former Fraulein Putt- f&rken of Hamburg. Good old Dr. Giabow may be seen pressing Senator Buddenbrook's hand for a moment in both of his, to be displaced next moment by Contractor Voigt. Pas- tor Pringsheim, in secular garb, only betraying his dignity by the length of his frock coat, comes up the steps with out- stretched arms and a beaming face.

"Ja, es stand schlecht um ihren Magen in dieser Zeit; an den Donnerstagen konnte die gesamte Familie die Verschlimmerung beobachten. Wie man die Klippe zu vermeiden suchte – das Gespräch strandete an dem Prozeß Hugo Weinschenks, Frau Permaneder selbst führte es unwiderstehlich darauf zu; und dann begann sie zu fragen, Gott und alle Welt furchtbar erregt um Antwort anzugehen, wie es möglich sei, daß Staatsanwalt Moritz Hagenström nachts ruhig schlafen könne! Sie begriff es nicht, sie würde es niemals fassen … und dabei wuchs ihre Aufregung bei jedem Worte. »Ich danke, ich esse nichts«, sagte sie und schob alles von sich, indem sie die Schultern erhob, den Kopf zurücklegte und sich einsam auf die Höhe ihrer Entrüstung zurückzog, um nichts als Bier zu sich zu nehmen, kaltes, bayerisches Bier, das sie seit der Zeit ihrer Münchener Ehe zu trinken gewöhnt war, in ihren leeren Magen hinabzugießen, dessen Nerven in Aufruhr waren, und der sich bitter rächte. Denn gegen Ende der Mahlzeit mußte sie sich erheben, in den Garten oder den Hof hinuntergehen und dort, gestützt auf Ida Jungmann oder Riekchen Severin, die fürchterlichsten Übelkeiten erdulden. Ihr Magen entledigte sich seines Inhaltes und fuhr dann fort, sich qualvoll zusammenzuziehen, um in diesem Krampfzustande minutenlang zu verharren; unfähig, noch etwas von sich zu geben, würgte und litt sie so lange Zeit …","Yes, her stomach was bad at that time; on Thursdays the whole family could watch the worsening.

She didn't get it, she would never believe it... and her excitement grew with every word. ""Thank you, I'm not eating,"" she said, and pushed everything away by shrugging her shoulders, laying her head back, and retreating lonely to the height of her indignation, to have nothing but beer, cold Bavarian beer, which she had been accustomed to drinking since the time of her marriage in Munich, into her empty stomach, whose nerves were in turmoil and which took bitter revenge. For towards the end of the meal she had to get up, go down into the garden or the yard and there, supported by Ida Jungmann or Riekchen Severin, endured the most terrible sickness. Her stomach emptied of its contents, and then continued to contract painfully, to remain in that convulsive state for minutes; unable to give anything more, she choked and suffered for so long...","The whole family had watched it grow worse on succeeding Thursdays.

She could not comprehend it, would never understand—and her agitation increased with every word. “Thank you, I’m not eating,” she would say, and shove her food away; raising her shoulders and laying her head back, she would retreat to the lonely heights of her outrage. The only thing she would put in her stomach was beer—the cold Bavarian beer she had been accustomed to drink since the days of her Munich marriage—and each time she poured it down, the nerves of her empty stomach rebelled and took their revenge. Toward the end of the meal she would have to excuse herself, and with the assistance of Ida Jungmann or Rieke Severin, she would go down to the garden or the back courtyard and suffer the most dreadful fits of nausea. Her stomach would empty its contents and then go on cramping, and the spasms could last for long, torturous minutes. Unable to vomit anything more, she would continue to gag miserably for a long time.","The family noticed that on Thursdays. And no matter how hard every one tried to keep off the rocks, the conversation always made straight for them ahd stuck there: on the sub-ject of Hugo Weinschenk's trial.

For her part, she could not understand it--she never would! Her agitation increased with every word. ' Thank you, I can't eat,"" she would say, and push away her plate. She would elevate her shoulders, toss her head, and in the height of her passion fall back upon the practice, acquired in her Munich years, of taking nothing but beer, cold Bavarian beer, poured into an empty stomach, the nerves of which were in rebellion and would revenge themselves bitterly. Toward the end of the meal she al-ways had tD get up and go down to the garden or the court, where she suffered the most dreadful fits of nausea, leaning upon Ida Jungmann or Riekchen Severin.

"Um zur Sache zu kommen, so sah die junge Dame als Walter Tell – sie trug auch in dieser Rolle ihre Brillantbrosche – ganz allerliebst aus und spielte so rührend, daß dem Schüler Buddenbrook vor innerer Begeisterung die Tränen in die Augen traten, ja daß er sich zu einer Handlungsweise hinreißen ließ, wie sie nur aus einem allzu starken Empfinden hervorgehen kann. In einer Pause nämlich erstand er im gegenübergelegenen Blumenladen für 1 Mark 8½ Schilling ein Bukett, mit welchem dieser vierzehnjährige Knirps mit seiner großen Nase und seinen kleinen tiefliegenden Augen den Weg zum Bühnenraum marschierte und, da niemand ihn aufhielt, vor einer Garderobentür auf Fräulein Meyer-de la Grange stieß, die im Gespräche mit Konsul Peter Döhlmann stand. Der Konsul wäre vor Lachen beinahe gegen die Wand gefallen, als er Christian mit dem Bukett daherkommen sah; der neue Suitier aber machte ernsthaft sein bestes Kompliment vor Walter Tell, überreichte ihm die Blumen, schüttelte langsam den Kopf und sagte in einem Tone, der vor Aufrichtigkeit beinahe bekümmert klang:","To get to the point, the young lady as Walter Tell - she also wore her diamond brooch in this role - very lovingly acted and acted so touchingly that tears came to the eyes of the pupil Buddenbrook from inner enthusiasm, even that he carried away to a course of action that can only emerge from an overly strong feeling. During a break he bought a bouquet in the flower shop across the street for 1 mark 8½ shillings, with which this fourteen-year-old boy with his big nose and small deep-set eyes marched his way to the stage and, since nobody stopped him, in front of a cloakroom door on Miss Meyer- de la Grange, who was in talks with Consul Peter Döhlmann. The Consul almost fell against the wall laughing when he saw Christian approaching with the bouquet; but the new suitier paid Walter Tell his best compliment, handed him the flowers, slowly shook his head, and said in a tone that sounded almost distressed with sincerity:","The point is that the young lady—who was wearing her diamond brooch on this occasion as well—looked so charming and was so touching in the role of Walter Tell that Christian Buddenbrook was moved to tears; indeed, he was quite swept away, resulting in the kind of gesture that can arise only out of strong emotion. During intermission he paid one mark and eight and a half shillings for a bouquet from the flower shop across the street, and with it in hand, this fourteen-year-old whippersnapper with a big nose and small, deep-set eyes marched backstage and, since no one was there to stop him, discovered Fräulein Meyer–de la Grange engaged in conversation with Consul Peter Döhlmann outside the door to her dressing room. At the sight of Christian waltzing up with his bouquet, the consul almost stumbled into the wall, he laughed so hard.","Well, to arrive at the point, this young lady looked so charming as Walter Tell, wore her brooch and spoke her lines with such effect, that Christian felt his heart swell with en-thusiasm, and tears rose to his eyes. He was moved by his transports to a course that only the very violence of emotion could pursue. He ran during the entr'acte to a flower-shop opposite, where, for the sum of one mark eight and a half shillings, he got at a bargain a bunch of flowers; and then this fourteen-year-old sprat, with his big nose and his deep-lying eyes, took his way to the green-room, since nobody stopped him, and came upon Fraulein Meyer-de-la-Grange, talking with Consul Peter D�hlmann at her dressing-room door. Peter D�hlmann nearly fell over with laughing when he saw Christian with the bouquet."
"Die Wochen aber verstrichen, und Erika Grünlichs Brautzeit neigte sich ihrem Ende entgegen. Das junge Paar hatte in einigen wenigen Häusern Besuche gemacht, denn der Direktor, ernster und in geselligen Dingen unerfahrener Arbeitsmensch, wie er war, gedachte seine Mußestunden der intimen Häuslichkeit zu widmen … ein Verlobungsdiner hatte Thomas, Gerda, das Brautpaar, Friederike, Henriette und Pfiffi Buddenbrook mit der nächsten Freundschaft des Senators in dem großen Saale des Fischergrubenhauses vereint, wobei es wiederum befremdete, daß der Direktor nicht aufhörte, Erikas dekolletierten Hals zu klopfen … und die Hochzeit nahte heran.","But the weeks passed, and Erika Grünlich's marriage was drawing to a close. The young couple had visited a few houses, for the manager, a serious worker and inexperienced in social matters as he was, intended to devote his leisure hours to intimate domesticity … Thomas, Gerda, the bridal couple, Friederike, Henriette and Pfiffi Buddenbrook united with the senator's closest friend in the great hall of the Fischergrube house, whereby it was again strange that the director kept patting Erika's low-cut neck ... and the wedding was approaching.","But the weeks of Erika Grünlich’s engagement were passing quickly and would soon be over. The young couple paid calls to only a few houses, because the director, being a serious, hardworking man with little experience in society, was of a mind to devote his leisure hours to more intimate, homey activities. There had been an engagement dinner in the great salon of the house on Fischer Grube—attended by Thomas, Gerda, the future bride and groom, Friederike, Henriette, and Pfiffi, and a few close friends of the senator—during the course of which there was some embarrassment over the way the director kept tapping at Erika’s neck, much of which was bared by her rather low-cut gown. And now the wedding day drew near.","The weeks fled by--the last weeks of Erica Gr�nlich'fl maidenhood. The young pair had made calls in only a few houses; for the Director, a serious and preoccupied man, with no social experience, intended to devote what leisure he had to intimate domesticity. There was a betrothal dinner in thfi great salon of the house in Fishers' Lane, at which, besides Thomas and Gerda, there were present the bridal pair and Henriette. Friederike and Pfiffi Buddenbrook, and some close friends of the Senator; and the Director continually pinched the bare shoulders of his fiancee, rather to the disgust of the other guests. And the wedding day drew near."

"Sie strebte danach, das weitläufige Haus mit dem Geiste des Heimgegangenen zu erfüllen, mit dem milden und christlichen Ernst, der eine vornehme Herzensheiterkeit nicht ausschloß. Die Morgen- und Abendandachten wurden in ausgedehnterem Umfange fortgesetzt. Die Familie versammelte sich im Eßsaale, während das Dienstpersonal in der Säulenhalle stand, und die Konsulin oder Klara verlasen aus der großen Familienbibel mit den ungeheuren Lettern einen Abschnitt, worauf man aus dem Gesangbuch ein paar Verse zum Harmonium sang, das die Konsulin spielte. Auch trat oft an die Stelle der Bibel eines der Predigt- und Erbauungsbücher mit schwarzem Einband und Goldschnitt, dieser Schatzkästchen, Psalter, Weihestunden, Morgenklänge und Pilgerstäbe, deren beständige Zärtlichkeit für das süße, wonnesame Jesulein ein wenig widerlich anmutete und von denen allzu viele im Hause vorhanden waren.","She strove to fill the sprawling house with the spirit of those who had passed away, with the gentle and Christian earnestness that did not exclude a noble cheerfulness of heart. The morning and evening prayers continued on a larger scale. The family assembled in the dining room, while the servants stood in the portico, and the consul or Clare read a passage from the great family Bible with the enormous letters, and a few verses were sung from the hymnal to the harmonium which the consul played. Often, too, the Bible was replaced by one of those sermon and devotional books with a black cover and gold edges, those treasure chests, psaltery, ordination hours, morning tones and pilgrim's staffs, whose constant tenderness for the sweet, blissful Infant Jesus seemed a little disgusting and of which all too many in the were available at home.","She strove to fill the spacious house with the same spirit that had inspired the deceased: a gentle Christian gravity that did not exclude a refined gladness of heart. The morning and evening services continued in expanded form. The family gathered in the dining room, while the servants stood in the columned hall, and Elisabeth or Clara read a passage from the large family Bible with its huge, funny letters; then a few verses were sung from the hymnal, accompanied by Madame Buddenbrook on the harmonium. The Bible passage was often replaced by a reading from a book of sermons or from one of the edifying, black-bound, gilt-edged volumes of which there were many in the house, with titles like The Jewel Box, Psaltery, Holy Hours, Morning Chimes, The Pilgrim’s Staff, and whose unrelenting tender affection for the sweet Baby Jesus tended to be somewhat cloying.","She strove to fill the great house with the spirit of the deceased--that mild and Christlike spirit which yet had not excluded a certain dignified and hearty good cheer. The morning and evening prayers were continued and lengthened. The family gathered in the dining-room, and the servants in the hall, to hear the Frau Consul or Clara read a chapter out of the great family Bible with the big letters. They also sang a few verses out of the hymn-book, accompanied by the Frau Consul on the little organ. Or, often, in place of the chapter from the Bible, they had a reading from one of those edifying or devotional books with the black binding and gilt edges--those Little Treasuries, Jewel-Caskets, Holy Hours, Morning Chimes, Pilgrims' Staffs, and the like, whose common trait was a sickly and languishing tenderness for the little Jesus, and of which there were all too many in the house."
Sechstes Kapitel,Sixth Chapter,6,CHAPTER VI
"Madame Kethelsen gehorchte ihrer jüngeren Schwester, sie ließ sich von ihr ausschelten wie ein Kind, und die Sache war die, daß Sesemi sie herzlich verachtete. Therese Weichbrodt war ein belesenes, ja beinahe gelehrtes Mädchen und hatte sich ihren Kinderglauben, ihre positive Religiosität und die Zuversicht, dort drüben einst für ihr schwieriges und glanzloses Leben entschädigt zu werden, in ernstlichen kleinen Kämpfen bewahren müssen. Madame Kethelsen dagegen war ungelehrt, unschuldig und einfältigen Gemütes. »Die gute Nelly!« sagte Sesemi. »Mein Gott, sie ist ein Kind, sie ist niemals auf einen Zweifel gestoßen, sie hat niemals einen Kampf zu bestehen gehabt, sie ist glücklich …« In solchen Worten lag ebensoviel Geringschätzung wie Neid, und das war ein schwacher, wenn auch verzeihlicher Charakterzug Sesemis.","Madame Kethelsen obeyed her younger sister, she let her scold her like a child, and the thing was that Sesemi heartily despised her. Therese Weichbrodt was a well-read, almost scholarly girl, and she had had to maintain her childhood faith, her positive religiosity and the confidence that one day she would be compensated for her difficult and lackluster life over there in serious little battles. Madame Kethelsen, on the other hand, was unlearned, innocent, and simple-minded. ""The good Nelly!"" said Sesemi. ""My God, she's a child, she's never had a doubt, she's never had a fight, she's happy..."" There was as much disdain as envy in such words, and it was a weak if forgivable trait sememis.","Madame Kethelsen obeyed her younger sister, let herself be scolded like a child, and the fact was that Sesame felt true disdain for her. Therese Weichbrodt was a well-read—indeed, almost learned—spinster, whose life was a series of small, earnest battles to maintain the faith of her childhood, her optimistic piety, and the conviction that she would one day be recompensed in the great beyond for her hard and lackluster life. Madame Kethelsen, however, was uneducated, a woman of innocent and simple temperament. “Sweet Nelly,” Sesame would say, “my God, what a child she is, has never had a doubt in her life, has never known the struggle of faith— she’s so happy.” Such words betrayed equal portions of contempt and envy—a definite, though forgivable, weakness in Sesame’s character.","Madame Kethelsen obeyed her younger sister, who scolded her as if she were a child. Scsemi, in fact, despised her warmly. Therese Weichbrodt was a well-read, almost a liter-ary woman. She struggled endlessly to keep her childhood faith, her religious assurance that somewhere in the beyond she was to be recompensed for the hard, dull present. But Madame Kethelsen, innocent, uninstructed, was all simplicity of nature. "" Dear, good Nelly, what a child she is! She never doubts or struggles, she is always happy."" In such remarks there was always as much contempt as envy. Con-tempt was a weakness of Sesemi's--perhaps a pardonable one."
"»Du wirst dich durch dieses miserable Geschreibsel einschüchtern lassen, – ja?!« Johann Buddenbrook kam zornig herbei, den Kerzenlöscher hinter sich her schleifend. »Unchristlichkeit! Ha!

"Der Andrang zu der Sitzung, welche die Plaidoyers gebracht hatte, war sehr groß gewesen, und Rechtsanwalt Doktor Breslauer aus Berlin hatte geredet, wie man niemals einen Menschen hatte reden hören.

"Christian oder, wie er schlecht und recht meistens genannt wurde, Krischan, der aus früherer Zeit mit allen mehr oder weniger bekannt oder befreundet war – denn die meisten waren Schüler des seligen Marcellus Stengel –, ward hier mit offenen Armen empfangen, denn wenn auch weder Kaufleute noch Gelehrte seine Geistesfähigkeiten für groß hielten, so kannte man doch seine amüsante, gesellschaftliche Begabung. In der Tat gab er hier seine besten Vorstellungen, erzählte er hier seine besten Geschichten. Er machte am Klubklavier einen Virtuosen, er ahmte englische und transatlantische Schauspieler und Opernsänger nach, er gab in der harmlosesten und unterhaltendsten Art Weiberaffären aus verschiedenen Gegenden zum besten – denn kein Zweifel: Christian Buddenbrook war ein »Suitier« –, er berichtete Abenteuer, die er auf Schiffen, auf Eisenbahnen, in St. Pauli, in Whitechapel, im Urwald erlebt hatte … Er erzählte bezwingend, hinreißend, in mühelosem Fluß, mit leicht klagender und schleppender Aussprache, burlesk und harmlos wie ein englischer Humorist. Er erzählte die Geschichte eines Hundes, der in einer Schachtel von Valparaiso nach San Franzisko geschickt worden und obendrein räudig war. Gott weiß, worin eigentlich die Pointe der Anekdote bestand; aber in seinem Munde war sie von ungeheurer Komik. Und wenn dann ringsumher sich niemand vor Lachen zu lassen wußte, so saß er selbst, mit seiner großen, gebogenen Nase, seinem dünnen, zu langen Halse und seinem rötlichblonden, schon spärlichen Haar und ließ, einen unruhigen und unerklärlichen Ernst auf dem Gesichte, eins seiner mageren, nach außen gekrümmten Beine über das andere geschlagen, seine kleinen, runden, tiefliegenden Augen nachdenklich umherschweifen … Beinahe schien es, als lache man auf seine Kosten, als lache man über ihn … Aber daran dachte er nicht.","Christian or, as he was more or less badly called, Krischan, who was more or less acquainted with all of them or friends from earlier times - because most of them were students of the blessed Marcellus Stengel - was welcomed here with open arms, because even if neither Merchants and scholars alike thought his intellectual faculties great, yet his amusing, social gifts were well known. Indeed, it was here that he gave his best performances, here he told his best stories. He made a virtuoso at the club piano, he imitated English and transatlantic actors and opera singers, he performed in the most harmless and entertaining way women's affairs from different quarters - for no doubt: Christian Buddenbrook was a ""suitier"" - he reported adventures that he had experienced on ships, on railways, in St. Pauli, in Whitechapel, in the jungle ... He told the story compellingly, entrancingly, with effortless flow, with slightly plaintive and sluggish pronunciation, burlesque and harmless like an English humorist. He told the story of a dog that was sent from Valparaiso to San Francisco in a box and was mangy to boot. God knows what the real point of the anecdote was; but in his mouth it was immensely funny. And when no one around knew how to laugh, he sat there himself, with his large, curved nose, his thin, too long neck and his reddish-blond, already sparse hair, and looked restless and inexplicably serious on his face of his skinny, splayed legs crossed over the other, his small, round, deep-set eyes wandering thoughtfully... It almost seemed as if they were laughing at his expense, as if they were laughing at him... But he didn't think of that.","Christian—or Krischan, as he usually was called, for good or ill—knew them all as friends or acquaintances from the old days—most of them had been students of the late Marcellus Stengel—and he was received with open arms, for, although neither the merchants nor the professionals considered him a great intellect, they recognized his amusing social gifts. And, indeed, he gave his best performanees there, told his very best stories. He did his concert-pianist imitation at the Club’s piano, he parodied English and American actors and opera singers, and, in his inoffensive and always entertaining way, he obliged them with stories about his affairs with women all over the world. No doubt about it, Christian Buddenbrook was a suitier. He told of amorous adventures he had had on ships, on trains, in Sankt Pauli, in Whitechapel, in the jungle. He charmed and captivated them with stories that flowed in an effortless stream, spoken in a slightly plaintive, languid voice and delivered in the harmlessly risqué fashion of an English comedian. He told a story about a dog that had been sent in a box from Valparaiso to San Francisco, and was mangy to boot. God only knew what the point of the anecdote was, but it was incredibly funny when he told it. And while everyone around him was convulsed with laughter, there he would sit—a man with a large hooked nose, a scrawny and overlong neck, and thinning reddish-blond hair—and, as a restless and inexplicably serious look spread over his face, he would cross one skinny, bowed leg over the other and let his little, round, deep-set eyes pensively scan the room. It almost seemed as if they were laughing at his expense, laughing at him. But that never occurred to Krischan.","Chris-tian--or, as he was called everywhere , Chris--had known them all more or less in the old days, for nearly all of them had been pupils of Marcellus Stengel. They received him into the Club with open arms; for, while neither business men nor scholars found him a genius, they recognized his amusing social gifts. It was here that he gave his best perform-ances and told his best stories. He did the virtuoso at the club piano and imitated English and transatlantic actors and opera singers. But the best things he did were stories of his affairs with women, related in the most harmless and entertaining way imaginable--adventures that had befallen him on shipboard, on trains, in St. Paul's, in White chapel, 271 BUDDENBRD DKS in the virgin forest. There was no doubt that Christian's weakness was for women. He narrated with a fluency and power that entranced his listeners, in an exhaustless stream, with his somewhat plaintive, drawling voice, burlesque and innocent, like an English humourist. He told a story about a dog that had been sent in a satchel from Valparaiso to San Francisco and was mangy to boot. Goodness knew what was the point of the anecdote--in his mouth it was indescrib-ably comic. And while everybody about him writhed with laughter, unable to leave off, he himself sat there cross-legged, a strange, uneasy seriousness in his face with its great hooked nose, his thin, long neck, his sparse light-red hair and little round deep-set eyes. It almost seemed as if the laugh were at his expense, as if they were laughing at him. But that never occurred to him."
"Die Jahre schwanden dahin. Der Eindruck, den das Erlebnis von Konsul Buddenbrooks Tochter in der Stadt und in der Familie hervorgerufen hatte, verwischte sich mehr und mehr. Tony selbst wurde an ihre Ehe nur dann und wann erinnert, wenn sie im Gesicht der gesund heranwachsenden kleinen Erika diese oder jene Ähnlichkeit mit Bendix Grünlich bemerkte. Aber sie kleidete sich wieder hell, trug ihr Haar wieder über die Stirn gekraust und besuchte wie ehemals Gesellschaften in ihrem Bekanntenkreise.","The years passed. The impression that the experience of Consul Buddenbrook's daughter had made on the town and on the family blurred more and more. Tony himself was only occasionally reminded of their marriage when she noticed a certain resemblance to Bendix Grünlich in the face of little Erika, who was growing up healthy. But she dressed brightly again, wore her hair curled over her forehead, and went to parties of her acquaintances as she had done before.","The years slipped by. The traces of what had befallen Consul Buddenbrook’s daughter grew more and more blurred, both in town and in the family. Tony herself was reminded of her marriage only if now and then some trait in sturdy little Erika’s healthy face would remind her of Bendix Grünlich. But her wardrobe was all bright colors again, she let her hair fall in little curls over her forehead, and she was once again busy with her round of social visits.","The years went on. Gradually people forgot their feelings over Tony's affair. She herself would only think now and then of her married life, when she saw on Erica's healthy, hearty little face some expression that reminded her of Bendix Gr�nlich. She dressed again in colours, wore her hair in the old way, and made the same old visits into society."
"Er hatte anfänglich manche Seite ungelesen gelassen und rasch vorwärtsschreitend, unbewußt und eilig nach der Hauptsache, nach dem eigentlich Wichtigen verlangend, sich nur diesen oder jenen Abschnitt zu eigen gemacht, der ihn fesselte. Dann aber stieß er auf ein umfängliches Kapitel, das er vom ersten bis zum letzten Buchstaben durchlas, mit festgeschlossenen Lippen und zusammengezogenen Brauen, ernst, mit einem vollkommenen, beinahe erstorbenen, von keiner Regung des Lebens um ihn her beeinflußbaren Ernst in der Miene.

"Die Hemmungen, denen Hannos Körper unterworfen war, die Schmerzen, die er erlitt, verfehlten nicht, in ihm jenes ernsthafte Gefühl vorzeitiger Erfahrenheit hervorzurufen, das man Altklugheit nennt, und wenn es auch, gleichsam als würde es von einer überwiegenden Begabung mit gutem Geschmacke niedergehalten, nicht oft und durchaus nicht aufdringlich zutage trat, so äußerte es sich doch hie und da in Form einer wehmütigen Überlegenheit … »Wie geht es dir, Hanno?« fragte jemand von seinen Verwandten, seine Großmutter, die Damen Buddenbrook aus der Breiten Straße … und ein kleines, resigniertes Emporziehen des Mundes, ein Zucken seiner vom blauen Matrosenkragen bedeckten Achseln war die ganze Antwort.","The inhibitions to which Hanno's body was subjected, the pains he suffered, did not fail to evoke in him that serious feeling of premature experience which is called precocity, and even if it were, as if it were being held down by a predominant talent with good taste , not often and not in the least obtrusive, it expressed itself here and there in the form of a melancholy superiority ...

"Gerdas Geigenspiel hatte für Thomas bislang, übereinstimmend mit ihren seltsamen Augen, die er liebte, zu ihrem schweren dunkelroten Haar und ihrer ganzen außerordentlichen Erscheinung, eine reizvolle Beigabe mehr zu ihrem eigenartigen Wesen bedeutet; jetzt aber, da er sehen mußte, wie die Leidenschaft der Musik, die ihm fremd war, so früh schon, so von Anbeginn und von Grund aus sich auch seines Sohnes bemächtigte, wurde sie ihm zu einer feindlichen Macht, die sich zwischen ihn und das Kind stellte, aus dem seine Hoffnungen doch einen echten Buddenbrook, einen starken und praktisch gesinnten Mann mit kräftigen Trieben nach außen, nach Macht und Eroberung machen wollten. Und in der reizbaren Verfassung, in der er sich befand, schien es ihm, als drohe diese feindselige Macht ihn zu einem Fremden in seinem eigenen Hause zu machen.","Gerda's playing of the violin had hitherto meant for Thomas a charming addition to her peculiar nature, in accordance with her strange eyes, which he loved, her heavy dark red hair and her whole extraordinary appearance; but now that he had to see how the passion for music, which was alien to him, took possession of his son so early, so from the very beginning and from the ground up, it became a hostile power that came between him and the child whom his hopes were turning into a true Buddenbrook, a strong and practical man with strong outward drives for power and conquest. And in the irritable state in which he found himself, it seemed to him that this hostile power threatened to make him a stranger in his own home.","Until now Gerda’s violin playing had been just another charming adjunct to her unique character, as much a part of her as those unusual eyes he so loved, as her heavy, chestnut hair, as her whole unique presence. But he was forced to watch as her passion for music—which he had always found rather odd—took possession of the child at such an early age. In some sense it had been part of Hanno from the very start, and Thomas regarded music as a hostile force that had come between him and his child—after all, he had hoped to make a genuine Buddenbrook of him, a strong and practical man with a powerful drive to master and take control of the world outside him. But in his present irritable mood, it seemed to him as if that hostile force was making him a stranger in his own house.","But now it almost seemed that the son was hostile, not only to the sur-roundings and the life in which his lot was cast, but even to his father as well.

"Niemand ahnte, was in Thomas Buddenbrook vorging, niemand durfte es ahnen, und gerade dies: alle Welt über seinen Gram, seinen Haß, seine Ohnmacht in Unwissenheit zu erhalten, war so fürchterlich schwer! Die Leute fingen an, ihn ein wenig lächerlich zu finden, aber vielleicht hätten sie Mitleid verspürt und solche Gefühle unterdrückt, wenn sie im entferntesten vermutet hätten, mit welcher angstvollen Reizbarkeit er vor dem Lächerlichen auf der Hut war, wie er es längst von weitem hatte nahen sehen und es vorausempfunden hatte, bevor noch ihnen irgend etwas davon in den Sinn gekommen war. Auch seine Eitelkeit, diese vielfach bespöttelte »Eitelkeit«, war ja zum guten Teile aus dieser Sorge hervorgegangen. Er war der erste gewesen, der das beständig hervortretende Mißverhältnis zwischen seiner eigenen Erscheinung und Gerdas sonderbarer Unberührtheit, der die Jahre nichts anhatten, mit Argwohn ins Auge gefaßt hatte, und jetzt, seit Herr von Throta in sein Haus gekommen war, mußte er seine Besorgnis mit dem Rest seiner Kräfte bekämpfen und verstecken, mußte es, um nicht durch das Kundwerden dieser Besorgnis schon seinen Namen dem allgemeinen Lächeln preiszugeben.","Nobody suspected what was going on in Thomas Buddenbrook, nobody was allowed to suspect it, and just this: it was so terribly difficult to keep everyone in ignorance about his grief, his hate, his powerlessness!

His vanity, too, this much-ridiculed ""vanity,"" was largely the result of this concern. He had been the first to suspect the ever-present discrepancy between his own appearance and Gerda's strange untouchedness, undamaged by the years, and now, since Herr von Throta had come to his house, he had to express his concern he had to fight and hide with the rest of his strength, lest his name be revealed to the general smile by the expression of this concern.","No one knew what Thomas Buddenbrook was thinking, no one was allowed to know—and that was what was so terribly difficult: keeping the rest of the world ignorant of his sorrow, his hate, his helplessness.

Even his vanity, his much-derided “vanity,” proceeded largely from this same worry. He had been the first to cast a mistrustful eye at the growing discrepancy between his own appearance and Gerda’s strange flawless beauty, which the years had left untouched; and now that Herr von Throta had entered his house, he had to combat and hide his worries with what little energy he still had. If he was to avoid becoming a laughing-stock, he had to keep his worries from becoming known.","No one dreamed what went on in Thomas Buddenbrook. No one must guess.

He had seen it coming long before , he had felt it beforehand, before any one else had such an idea in his head. His much-carped-at vanity had its source largely in this fear. He had been first to see, with dismay, the growing disparity between himself and his lovely wife, on whom the years had not laid a finger. And now, since the advent of Herr von Throta, he had to fight with the last rem-nant of his strength to dissimulate his own misgivings, in order that they might not make him a laughing-stock in the eyes of the community."

"»Ja, Papa … und ich habe Erika sehr lieb … obgleich Grünlich behauptet, ich sei nicht kinderlieb … Ich würde mich nie von ihr trennen, das sage ich dir … aber Grünlich – nein!… Grünlich – nein!… Nun macht er auch noch Bankerott!… Ach Papa, wenn du mich und Erika nach Hause nehmen willst … mit Freuden!

Grünlich - no! ... Now he does it too Bankruptcy!... Oh papa, if you want to take me and Erika home... with joy! Now you know!”","“Yes, Papa. And I love Erika very much. Although Grünlich claims I’m not fond of children. I would never part with her, never. But Grünlich—no! Grünlich— no! And now he’s bankrupt.

The Consul compressed his lips again."

"»Jauchze laut, Jerusalem!« schlossen die Chorknaben, und die Stimmen, die fugenartig nebeneinander hergegangen waren, fanden sich in der letzten Silbe friedlich und freudig zusammen. Der klare Akkord verhallte, und tiefe Stille legte sich über Säulenhalle und Landschaftszimmer. Die Mitglieder der Familie blickten unter dem Drucke der Pause vor sich nieder; nur Direktor Weinschenks Augen schweiften keck und unbefangen umher, und Frau Permaneder ließ ihr trocknes Räuspern vernehmen, das ununterdrückbar war. Die Konsulin aber schritt langsam zum Tische und setzte sich inmitten ihrer Angehörigen auf das Sofa, das nun nicht mehr wie in alter Zeit unabhängig und abgesondert vom Tische dastand. Sie rückte die Lampe zurecht und zog die große Bibel heran, deren altersbleiche Goldschnittfläche ungeheuerlich breit war. Dann schob sie die Brille auf die Nase, öffnete die beiden ledernen Spangen, mit denen das kolossale Buch geschlossen war, schlug dort auf, wo das Zeichen lag, daß das dicke, rauhe, gelbliche Papier mit dem übergroßen Druck zum Vorschein kam, nahm einen Schluck Zuckerwasser und begann, das Weihnachtskapitel zu lesen.","""Rejoice loudly, Jerusalem!"" concluded the choirboys, and the voices that had been fugue-like joined together peacefully and joyfully on the last syllable. The clear chord died away, and a deep stillness fell over the portico and the landscape room. The members of the family looked down under the pressure of the pause; only Director Weinschenk's eyes darted boldly and unselfconsciously around, and Frau Permaneder let out her dry throat, which I couldn't suppress. The Consul, however, walked slowly to the table and sat down in the midst of her relatives on the sofa, which was no longer separate from the table as it had been in the old days. She adjusted the lamp and pulled out the large Bible, the gold-edged surface of which, pale with age, was immensely wide. Then she put her glasses on her nose, undid the two leather clasps that closed the colossal book, opened it where there was a sign that the thick, rough, yellowish paper with the oversized print was visible, and took one Sip sugar water and started reading the Christmas chapter.","“Shout for joy, Jerusalem!” the choirboys sang to end their program, and after a kind of interwoven fugue, the voices arrived in joyful, peaceful harmony at the last syllable. The echoes of the chord faded away, and deep silence lay over the columned hall and the landscape room. Under the weight of the long pause, all the members of the family gazed at their feet. Only Hugo Weinschenk’s eyes roamed, bold and unperturbed, around the room. Frau Permaneder coughed an audible dry cough that she simply could not suppress. Madame Buddenbrook, however, slowly strode to the table and joined her family, taking a seat on the sofa, which no longer stood off to itself at some distance from the table, as in the old days. She adjusted the lamp and pulled the large Bible over to her—the gilt on its immense embossed cover faded with age. Then she set her glasses on her nose, undid the colossal book’s two leather clasps, opened it to the bookmark, revealing a heavy, coarse, yellowed page of huge print, took a sip of sugar-water, and began to read the Christmas story.","""Exult, Jerusalem!"" finished the choir; and their voices, following one another in fugue form, united joyously in the last syllable. The clear accord died away; deep silence reigned in the pillared hall and the landscape-room. The elders looked down, oppressed by the pause; only Director Weinschenk's eyes roved boldly about, and Frau Permaneder coughed her dry cough, which she could not suppress. Now the Frau Consul moved slowly to the table and sat among her family. She turned up the lamp and took in her hands the great Bible with its edges of faded gold-leaf. She stuck her glasses on her nose, unfastened the two great leather hasps of the book, opened it to the place where there was a book-mark, took a sip of eau, sucree, and began to read, from the yellowed page with the large print, the Christmas chapter."
"Dann begann er von neuem. Plötzlich jedoch brach er ab. Ganz unvermittelt wurde er ernst: so überraschend, daß es aussah, als ob eine Maske von seinem Gesicht hinunterfiel; er stand auf, strich mit der Hand durch sein spärliches Haar, begab sich an einen anderen Platz und blieb dort, schweigsam, übellaunig, mit unruhigen Augen und einem Gesichtsausdruck, als horche er auf irgendein unheimliches Geräusch.","Then he started again. Suddenly, however, he broke off. All of a sudden he became serious: so surprising that it seemed as if a mask were falling off his face; he got up, ran his hand through his sparse hair, went to another place and stayed there, silent, ill-tempered, with restless eyes and an expression as if he were listening for some weird noise.","He started all over again—and then suddenly broke off. He turned serious, abruptly, surprisingly, as if a mask had fallen from his face. He stood up, ran his hand through his sparse hair, moved to another chair, and there he sat, silent, foul-humored, with edgy eyes and a look on his face as if he were listening to some mysterious sound.","Then he began to play again, but broke off suddenly and became serious, as though a mask had fallen over his features. He got up, ran his hand through his scanty hair, moved away, and stood silent, obviously fallen into a bad mood, with un-quiet eyes and an expression as though he were listening to some kind of uncanny noise."
"»Erlauben Sie nur … können Sie nicht?« fragte Herr Kesselmeyer und sah ihn durch seinen Kneifer mit krauser Nase an … »Wenn ich dem Herrn Konsul zu bedenken geben dürfte … dies wäre eigentlich gerade jetzt eine allerliebste Okkasion, die Stärke der Firma Johann Buddenbrook zu beweisen …«","""Permit me... can't you?"" asked Mr. Kesselmeyer, looking at him through his pince-nez with a wrinkled nose... ""If I might ask the Consul to consider... this would actually be a very nice opportunity right now, the strength of the Johann Buddenbrook company to prove …""","“If I may be so bold—is it because you cannot pay?” Herr Kesselmeyer asked, wrinkling up his nose and staring through his pince-nez. “If I might make a suggestion, Consul Buddenbrook, this would be an excellent opportunity to prove the strength of the firm of Johann Buddenbrook.”","""Permit me--may I ask whether you could if you would?"" asked Herr Kesselmeyer, looking at him through his glasses, with his nose wrinkled up. ""I suggest to the Consul that this would be a most advantageous time to display the strength of the firm of Buddenbrook."""

"Dann wechselte er einen Händedruck mit Konsul Kröger und nahm, Herrn Marcus gegenüber, Platz an der Tafel, wobei er seine Schwester Tony mit erhobener Augenbraue ziemlich verwundert ansah. Aber sie legte in einer Weise den Kopf zurück und das Kinn auf die Brust, daß er jede Bemerkung über ihre Gegenwart unterdrückte.","Then he exchanged a handshake with Consul Kröger and took a seat at the table opposite Herr Marcus, raising an eyebrow at his sister Tony in some astonishment. But she laid her head back and her chin on her chest in such a way that he suppressed any remark about her presence.","Then he shook hands with Consul Kröger, sat down at the table beside Herr Marcus, and, raising an eyebrow, looked across in some surprise at his sister Tony.

"Plötzlich wandte er den Kopf vom Fenster weg, stieß einen kleinen freundlichen Seufzer aus, indem er in die lautlose Klasse hineinblickte, sagte »Ja, ja!« und lächelte mehrere Schüler zutraulich an. Er war guter Laune, es war offenbar. Eine Bewegung der Erleichterung ging durch den Raum. Es kam so viel, es kam alles darauf an, ob Doktor Mantelsack guter Laune war oder nicht, denn man wußte, daß er sich seinen Stimmungen unbewußt und ohne die geringste Selbstkritik überließ. Er war von einer ganz ausnehmenden, grenzenlos naiven Ungerechtigkeit, und seine Gunst war hold und flatterhaft wie das Glück. Stets hatte er ein paar Lieblinge, zwei oder drei, die er »Du« und mit Vornamen nannte, und die es gut hatten wie im Paradiese. Sie konnten beinahe sagen, was sie wollten, und es war dennoch richtig; und nach der Stunde plauderte Doktor Mantelsack aufs menschlichste mit ihnen. Eines Tages jedoch, vielleicht nach den Ferien, Gott allein wußte, warum, war man gestürzt, vernichtet, abgeschafft, verworfen, und ein anderer wurde mit Vornamen genannt … Diesen Glückseligen pflegte er die Fehler in den Extemporalien ganz leicht und zierlich anzustreichen, so daß ihre Arbeiten auch bei großer Mangelhaftigkeit einen reinlichen Aspekt behielten. In anderen Heften aber fuhr er mit breiter und zorniger Feder umher und überschwemmte sie mit Rot, so daß sie einen abschreckenden und verwahrlosten Eindruck machten. Und da er die Fehler nicht zählte, sondern die Zensuren je nach der Menge von roter Tinte erteilte, so gingen seine Günstlinge mit großem Vorteil aus der Sache hervor. Bei diesem Verfahren dachte er sich nicht das geringste, sondern fand es vollständig in der Ordnung und ahnte nichts von Parteilichkeit. Hätte jemand den traurigen Mut besessen, dagegen zu protestieren, so wäre er der Aussicht verlustig gegangen, jemals geduzt und mit Vornamen genannt zu werden. Und diese Hoffnung ließ niemand fahren …","Suddenly he turned his head away from the window, let out a small, friendly sigh while looking into the silent class, said ""Yes, yes!"" and smiled trustingly at several students. He was in a good mood, it was evident. A movement of relief went through the room. There was so much going on, it all depended on whether Doctor Mantelsack was in a good mood or not, for it was known that he let his moods unconsciously and without the slightest self-criticism. He was of a most exceptional, boundlessly naive injustice, and his favor was sweet and fickle like luck. He always had a couple of favourites, two or three, whom he called ""du"" and by their first names, and who had it as good as in paradise. They could say almost what they liked and it was still right; and after the lesson Dr. Mantelsack chatted with them in the most humane way. One day, however, perhaps after the holidays, God alone knew why, one was overthrown, destroyed, abolished, rejected, and another was called by his first name... He used to mark the mistakes in the extratemporaries very lightly and delicately for these blessed ones, so that their work retained a clean aspect even when it was very defective. In other notebooks, however, he drove about with a broad and angry pen and flooded them with red, so that they made a forbidding and neglected impression. And since he did not count the mistakes, but gave the grades according to the amount of red ink, his favorites came out of it with great advantage. He did not think the least about this procedure, but found it completely in order and suspected nothing of partisanship. If anyone had had the sad courage to protest against this, they would have lost the prospect of ever being called first-names and on the first-name basis. And nobody gave up that hope...","Suddenly he turned his head away from the window, heaved a little friendly sigh, said, “Yes, yes,” stared at his hushed pupils, and smiled affably at several of them. He was in a good mood, that was obvious. A tremor of relief passed through the room. So much depended—indeed, everything depended—on whether Dr. Mantelsack was in a good mood or not, for they all knew that he spontaneously succumbed to every mood without a trace of self-control. He was a man capable of the most imposing, boundless, and naive injustice, and his favor was as precious and fickle as fortune itself. He always had a few favorites, two or three, whom he called by their first names—and they lived in paradise. They could say almost anything they liked, and it was always the right answer. When class was over, Dr. Mantelsack would chat quite genially with them. But then came a day, after vacation perhaps, and one found oneself thrown down, dispatched, dismissed —God only knew why— and another boy would be addressed by his first name. When correcting the tests of these happy souls, he made light and dainty checkmarks next to the mistakes, so that their work still had a very tidy look even when it was filled with errors. But all the other papers were treated to angry, broad strokes of his pen, until they were swimming in red and looked shockingly sloppy. And since he did not count mistakes, but awarded censure and praise according to the quantity of red ink he had expended on any given test, his favorites always had a great advantage. He did not have the least compunction about using this method—he found it perfectly in order, never even suspected he was playing favorites. Anyone who might have had the unfortunate courage to protest would have forfeited all hope of ever being called by his first name. And no one was about to abandon that hope.","He turned sharply away from the window and gave vent to a little good-natured sigh, smiling familiarly at several pupils. His mood was obviously good, and a wave of relief ran through the classroom. So much--everything , in fact--depended on whether Dr. Mantelsack was in a good mood! For the whole form was aware that he gave way to the feeling of the moment, whatever that might happen to be, with-out the slightest restraint. He was most extraordinarily, boundlessly, naively unjust, and his favour was as inconstant as that of fortune herself. He had always a few favourites--two or three--whom he called by their given names, and these lived in paradise. They might say almost anything they liked; and after the lesson Dr. Mantelsack would talk with them just like a human being. But a day would come--perhaps after the holidays--when for no apparent reason they were dethroned, cast out, rejected, and others elevated to their place. The mistakes of these favourites would be passed over with neat, careful corrections, so that their work retained a respectable appearance, no matter how bad it was; whereas he would attack the other copy-books with heavy, ruthless pen, and fairly flood them with red ink, so that their appearance was shocking indeed. And as he never troubled to count the mistakes, but distributed bad marks in proportion to the red ink he had expended, his favourites always emerged with great credit from these exercises. He was not even aware of the rank injustice of this conduct. And if anybody had ever had the temerity to call his attention to it, that person would have been for ever deprived of even the chance of be-coming a favourite and being called by his first name. There was nobody who was willing to let slip the chance."
"Man saß nicht drei Minuten auf den hellen, geschweiften Fauteuils beieinander, als Konsul Oeverdieck, Sohn des verstorbenen Bürgermeisters, mit seiner Gattin, der geborenen Kistenmaker, eintraf; und als Konsul Huneus sich verabschiedete, begegnete er seinem Bruder, der eine Million weniger besaß, aber dafür Senator war.","They weren't sitting together for three minutes on the light, curved armchairs when Consul Oeverdieck, son of the late mayor, arrived with his wife, nee Kistenmaker; and when Consul Huneus took his leave, he met his brother, who had a million less, but was a senator.","They had not been sitting for three minutes in their stylish easy chairs—all gentle curves and light colors—when Consul Oeverdieck, the son of the deceased mayor, and his wife, née Kistenmaker, arrived. And as Consul Huneus was on his way out, he was met by his brother, who was worth only four million but bore the title of senator.","They had not been sitting for three minutes in the elegant arm-chairs of the salon when Consul Overdieck, son of the deceased Burgomaster, and his wife, who was a Kistenmaker, were announced.

"Da war ferner des Konsuls Schwester Klara in Riga … Daß ihre Ehe mit dem Pastor Tiburtius ohne Kindersegen geblieben war, mochte hingehen, denn Klara Buddenbrook hatte sich niemals Kinder gewünscht und besaß ohne Zweifel höchst wenig mütterliches Talent. Aber ihre Gesundheit ließ, ihren und ihres Mannes Briefen zufolge, allzuviel zu wünschen übrig, und die Gehirnschmerzen, an denen sie schon als junges Mädchen gelitten, traten, so hieß es, neuerdings periodisch in fast unerträglichem Grade auf.","There was also the consul's sister, Klara, in Riga... The fact that her marriage to Pastor Tiburtius had remained childless may well be true, for Klara Buddenbrook had never wanted children and undoubtedly possessed very little maternal talent. But her health, according to her and her husband's letters, left too much to be desired, and the cerebral pains, from which she had suffered as a young girl, were said to have recurred intermittently to an almost unbearable degree.","And then there was the consul’s sister Clara in Riga. It was perhaps no matter that her marriage with Pastor Tiburtius had not been blessed with children, particularly since Clara Buddenbrook had never wanted them and almost certainly had very few of the requisite maternal talents. But, to judge from her husband’s letters, her health was not of the best; and the headaches from which she had suffered as a child now appeared with periodic regularity and had grown almost unbearable.","Then there was the Consul's sister Clara in Riga. Her mar-riage with Pastor Tiburtius had remained unblest with chil-dren--but then, as Clara Buddenbrook she had never wanted children, and probably had very little talent for motherhood.

"Es war ein Mann von vierzig Jahren. Kurzgliedrig und beleibt, trug er einen weit offenstehenden Rock aus braunem Loden, eine helle und geblümte Weste, die in weicher Wölbung seinen Bauch bedeckte und auf der eine goldene Uhrkette mit einem wahren Bukett, einer ganzen Sammlung von Anhängseln aus Horn, Knochen, Silber und Korallen prangte – ein Beinkleid ferner von unbestimmter graugrüner Farbe, welches zu kurz war und aus ungewöhnlich steifem Stoff gearbeitet schien, denn seine Ränder umstanden unten kreisförmig und faltenlos die Schäfte der kurzen und breiten Stiefel. – Der hellblonde, spärliche, fransenartig den Mund überhängende Schnurrbart gab dem kugelrunden Kopfe mit seiner gedrungenen Nase und seinem ziemlich dünnen und unfrisierten Haar etwas Seehundartiges. Die »Fliege«, die der fremde Herr zwischen Kinn und Unterlippe trug, stand im Gegensatze zum Schnurrbart ein wenig borstig empor. Die Wangen waren außerordentlich dick, fett, aufgetrieben und gleichsam hinaufgeschoben zu den Augen, die sie zu zwei ganz schmalen, hellblauen Ritzen zusammenpreßten und in deren Winkeln sie Fältchen bildeten. Dies gab dem solcherart verquollenen Gesicht einen Mischausdruck von Ergrimmtheit und biederer, unbeholfener, rührender Gutmütigkeit. Unterhalb des kleinen Kinnes lief eine steile Linie in die schmale weiße Halsbinde hinein … die Linie eines kropfartigen Halses, der keine Vatermörder geduldet haben würde. Untergesicht und Hals, Hinterkopf und Nacken, Wangen und Nase, alles ging ein wenig formlos und gepolstert ineinander über … Die ganze Gesichtshaut war infolge aller dieser Schwellungen über die Gebühr straff gespannt und zeigte an einzelnen Stellen, wie am Ansatz der Ohrläppchen und zu beiden Seiten der Nase, eine spröde Rötung … In der einen seiner kurzen, weißen und fetten Hände hielt der Herr seinen Stock, in der anderen ein grünes Tirolerhütchen, geschmückt mit einem Gemsbart.","It was a man of forty years. Short-limbed and stout, he wore a wide-open coat of brown loden, a light-colored, flowered waistcoat that covered his stomach in a soft curve, and on which was a gold watch chain with a veritable bouquet, a whole collection of appendages made of horn, bone, silver, and Coral was emblazoned - also a pair of trousers of an indefinite grey-green color, which was too short and seemed to be made of unusually stiff material, for its edges circled the shafts of the short and wide boots in a circle and without folds. – The light-blond, sparse mustache hanging over the mouth like a fringe gave the spherical head with its squat nose and rather thin and uncooked hair something seal-like. The ""bow tie"" which the strange gentleman wore between his chin and lower lip stood up a little bristly in contrast to his mustache. The cheeks were extraordinarily thick, fat, swollen and, as it were, pushed up to the eyes, which pressed them together into two very narrow, light blue cracks and at the corners of which they formed little wrinkles. This gave the so swollen face a mixed expression of anger and staid, awkward, touching good nature. Below the small chin ran a steep line into the narrow white cravat... the line of a goiter neck that would have brooked no parricides. Lower face and neck, back of head and neck, cheeks and nose, everything merged into one another a little shapelessly and padded... The whole skin of the face was excessively stretched as a result of all this swelling and showed in individual places, such as at the base of the earlobes and on both sides the nose, a brittle reddening... In one of his short, white and fat hands the gentleman held his cane, in the other a green Tyrolean hat, adorned with a goatee beard.","He was a man of about forty, portly, with short arms and legs. His brown loden coat was unbuttoned, revealing a bright, flowered vest that covered the gentle vault of his stomach and across which hung a gold watch chain with an entire bouquet of charms, a glittering collection of silver, coral, bone, and deerhorn trinkets. His trousers were an indefinite grayish green—and too short; they were apparently made of some strange stiff fabric, because the cuffs fell in unpleated circles around the short shafts of his broad boots. A pale blond, sparse mustache that hung like fringe over his mouth, a perfectly round head, a stump of a nose, and thinning, badly cut hair combined to make him look somewhat like a walrus. Between his chin and lower lip, the stranger wore a bristly goatee, which, in contrast to his drooping mustache, tipped slightly upward. His cheeks were so extraordinarily fat and puffy that they squeezed his eyes into two very narrow pale blue slits with lots of wrinkles at the corners. All this gave his pudgy face an expression that was a mixture of ferocity and simple, clumsy, touching bonhomie. His chin dropped in a straight line to join his narrow white necktie—the goiterous neck could never have endured a stiff high collar. The lower half of his face, cheeks and nose, the back of his head, the nape of his neck—it all merged like a pile of little shapeless pillows. The puffiness and swelling had stretched the skin on his face so tight that it was chapped and red in some places—just below the earlobes and at both sides of his nose, for instance. The gentleman held his cane in one short, white, fat hand, in the other his green Tyrolean hat trimmed with a chamois tuft.","He was a man of forty years. Short-legged and chubby, he wore a wide-open coat of brown frieze and a light flowered waistcoat which covered the gentle protuberant curve of his stomach and supported a gold watch-chain with a whole bou-quet of charms made of horn, bone, silver, and coral. His trousers were of an indefinite grey-green colour and too short. The material must have been extraordinarily stiff, for the edges stood out in a circle around the legs of his short, broad boots. He had a bullet head, untidy hair, and a stubby nose, and the light-blond curly moustache drooping over his mouth made him look like a walrus. By way of contrast, the im-perial between his chin and his underlip stood out rather bristly. His cheeks were extremely fat and puffy, crowding his eyes into two narrow light-blue cracks with wrinkles at the corners. The whole face looked swollen and had a funny expression of fierceness, mingled with an almost touching good nature. Directly below his tiny chin a steep line ran into the white neck-cloth: his goiterous neck could not have endured a choker. In fact, the whole lower part of his fare and his neck, the back of his head, his cheeks and nose, all ran rather formlfssly in together. The whole skin of the face was stretched to an immoderate tightness and showed a roughness at the ear-joinings and the sides of the nose. In 323 one of his short fat white hands the visitor held his stick; in the other his green Tyrolese hat, decorated with a chamois beard."
"Zwei- oder dreimal, an Nachmittagen, da es aussah, als ob die Sonne hervorkommen wollte, erschienen zur Table d'hote ein paar Bekannte aus der Stadt, die sich gern ein wenig unabhängig von ihren Angehörigen unterhielten: Senator Doktor Gieseke, Christians Schulkamerad, und Konsul Peter Döhlmann, der übrigens schlecht aussah, weil er sich durch maßlosen Gebrauch von Hunyadi-Janos-Wasser verdarb. Dann setzten sich die Herren in ihren Paletots unter das Zeltdach der Konditorei, gegenüber dem Musiktempel, in dem nicht mehr musiziert wurde, tranken ihren Kaffee und verdauten ihre fünf Gänge, indem sie in den herbstlichen Kurgarten hinausblickten und plauderten …","Two or three times in the afternoon, when it looked as if the sun was about to come out, a couple of acquaintances from the city turned up for the table d'hote, who liked to talk a bit independently of their relatives: Senator Doctor Gieseke, Christian's schoolmate, and Consul Peter Döhlmann, who incidentally looked bad because he was spoiled by excessive use of Hunyadi Janos water. Then the gentlemen sat down in their Paletots under the tent roof of the pastry shop, opposite the music temple, where music was no longer played, drank their coffee and digested their five courses by looking out at the autumnal spa garden and chatting ...","On two or three afternoons, when it looked as if the sun would break through, a few acquaintances from town appeared at dinner looking for a little amusement away from their families: Senator Gieseke, Christian’s old schoolchum, and Consul Peter Döhlmann, who did not look well, either, and had been purging himself with far too much Hunyadi-Janos water. And then the gentlemen would sit in their overcoats under the pastry-shop awnings, facing the bandstand—although there was no longer any music—and drink their coffee and digest their five-course dinner as they chatted and gazed out at the autumnal gardens.","Two or three times in the afternoon it looked as though the sun were coming out; and a few acquaintances from town appeared-- people who enjoyed a holiday away from their families: Senator Dr. Gieseke, Christian's friend, and Consul Peter Dohlmann, who looked very ill indeed, and was killing himself with Hunyadi-Janos water.

"»Sie haben gesagt«, antwortete der Senator, als der Anfall vorüber war, und streichelte ihre Hand … »Sie haben gesagt, daß unsere gute Mutter in ein paar Tagen wieder auf den Füßen sein wird. Daß du das noch nicht kannst, weißt du, das liegt daran, daß dieser dumme Husten natürlich die Lunge ein bißchen angegriffen hat … es ist nicht gerade Lungenentzündung«, sagte er, da er sah, daß ihr Blick noch eindringlicher wurde … »obgleich ja auch das noch nicht das Ende aller Dinge wäre, ach, da gibt es Schlimmeres! Kurz, die Lunge ist etwas gereizt, sagen die beiden, und damit mögen sie wohl recht haben … Wo ist denn die Severin?«","""You said,"" the senator replied when the fit was over, stroking her hand... ""You said our good mother would be on her feet in a few days.

'although yes even if it weren't the end of all things, alas, there are worse things! In short, the lungs are a bit irritated, they both say, and they may be right about that...

The wretched cough is responsible for your lying here. The lung is of course BUDDENBRD OKS slightly affected--it is not exactly inflammation,"" he hastened to say, as he saw her narrowing gaze, ""but even if it were, that needn't necessarily be so bad.
