"Jetzt fuhr der Besprochene eben zur Tür herein, nachdem er zuerst mit dem Kopf so fest dagegen gerannt war, dass alles erklirrte davon; er musste pressiert sein. Atemlos und keuchend stand er nun mitten in der Stube still und streckte einen Brief aus. Das war auch ein Ereignis, das noch nie vorgekommen war, ein Brief mit einer Aufschrift an das Heidi, den man ihm auf der Post im Dörfli übergeben hatte. Jetzt setzten sich alle voller Erwartung um den Tisch herum, und Heidi machte seinen Brief auf und las ihn laut und ohne Anstoß vor. Der Brief war von der Klara Sesemann geschrieben. Sie erzählte Heidi, dass es seit seiner Abreise so langweilig geworden sei in ihrem Hause, sie es nicht lang hintereinander so aushalten könne und so lange den Vater gebeten habe, bis er die Reise ins Bad Ragaz schon auf den kommenden Herbst festgestellt habe, und die Großmama wolle auch mitkommen, denn sie wolle auch das Heidi und den Großvater besuchen auf der Alm. Und weiter ließ die Großmama noch dem Heidi sagen, es habe Recht getan, dass es der alten Großmutter die Brötchen habe mitbringen wollen, und damit sie diese nicht trocken essen müsse, komme gleich der Kaffee noch dazu, er sei schon auf der Reise, und wenn sie selbst nach der Alm komme, so müsse das Heidi sie auch zur Großmutter führen.","Now the person we were talking to drove through the door, after first banging his head against it so hard that everything rattled from it; he must have been pressed. Breathless and panting, he stood still in the middle of the room and held out a letter. That was also an event that had never happened before, a letter addressed to Heidi that had been handed to him at the post office in Dorfli. Now, full of anticipation, everyone sat down around the table, and Heidi opened his letter and read it aloud without offense. The letter was written by Klara Sesemann. She told Heidi that since his departure it had become so boring in her house that she couldn't stand it like this for long and had kept asking her father until he had already arranged for the trip to Bad Ragaz in the coming autumn, and they Grandma wanted to come too, because she also wanted to visit Heidi and grandfather on the mountain pasture. And grandma also had Heidi told that it was right that she wanted to bring the old grandmother the rolls and so that she wouldn't have to eat dry, the coffee will come soon, it's already on its way, and if she comes to the Alm herself, Heidi must also take her to grandmother's.","The next moment Peter himself arrived in great haste. He had a letter for Heidi, which had been given to him in the village. What an event, a letter for Heidi! They all sat down at the table while the child read it aloud. The letter was from Clara Sesemann, who wrote that everything had got so dull since Heidi left. She said that she could not stand it very long, and therefore her father had promised to take her to Ragatz this coming fall. She announced that Grandmama was coming too, for she wanted to see Heidi and her grandfather. Grandmama, having heard about the rolls, was sending some coffee, too, so that the grandmother would not have to eat them dry. Grandmama also insisted on being taken to the grandmother herself when she came on her visit.","At that moment Peter himself came charging in, out of breath, and banged his head against the door in his haste. He held out a letter for Heidi which he had been given at the post office. No one had letters in his home, and Heidi had certainly never had one before. Everybody sat down and listened while she opened it, and read it aloud. It was from Clara, who wrote: ‘It’s been so dreadfully dull here since you went away, that I can hardly bear it. But Papa has promised me that I can go to Ragaz in the autumn. Grandmamma will come with me. After that she says we may come to visit you and your grandfather. I told her about you wanting to take some rolls to Grannie, and she was pleased, and said I was to tell you you were quite right. She is sending some coffee for her to have with them, and says she would like to see Grannie as well when we come to the mountains.’","He could not get over the loss of his daughter who had died some months before, and who had been his sole and constant companion for many years. Mr. Sesemann, who had been striding up and down the room, suddenly paused beside his friend and laying his hand on his shoulder said: ""Doctor, I have an idea. How would it be for you to go, and pay Heidi a visit in our name? You need a change of scene. I cannot bear to see you so sad; you are no longer the same man."" The doctor was taken aback at this sudden proposal and wanted to make objections, but his friend gave him no time to say anything. He was so delighted with his idea, that he seized the doctor by the arm and drew him into Clara's room. She held out her hand to him as he came up to her; he took a seat beside her, and her father also drew up his chair, and taking Clara's hand in his began to talk to her of the Swiss journey and how he himself had looked forward to it. He passed as quickly as he could over the main point that it was now impossible for her to undertake it, for he dreaded the tears that would follow; but he went on without pause to tell her of his new plan, and dwelt on the great benefit it would be to his friend if he could be persuaded to take this holiday. The tears were indeed swimming in the blue eyes, although Clara struggled to keep them down for her father's sake, but it was a bitter disappointment to give up the journey, the thought of which had been her only joy and solace during the lonely hours of her long illness. She knew, however, that her father would never refuse her a thing unless he was certain that it would be harmful for her. So she swallowed her tears as well as she could and turned her thoughts to the one hope still left her. Taking the doctor's hand and stroking it, she said pleadingly,— ""Dear doctor, you will go and see Heidi, won't you? and then you can come and tell me all about it, what it is like up there, and what Heidi and the grandfather, and Peter and the goats do all day. I know them all so well! And then you can take what I want to send to Heidi; I have thought about it all, and also something for the grandmother. Do pray go, dear doctor, and I will take as much cod liver oil as you like."" Whether this promise finally decided the doctor it is impossible to say, but it is certain that he smiled and said,— ""Then I must certainly go, Clara, for you will then get as plump and strong as your father and I wish to see you. And have you decided when I am to start?"" ""Tomorrow morning—early if possible,"" replied Clara. ""Yes, she is right,"" put in Mr. Sesemann, ""the sun is shining and the sky is blue, and there is no time to be lost; it is a pity to miss a single one of these days on the mountain."" The doctor could not help laughing. ""You will be reproaching me next for not being there already; well I must go and make arrangements for getting off."" But Clara would not let him go until she had given him endless messages for Heidi, and had explained all he was to look at so as to give her an exact description on his return. She would pack the presents she had already bought, and send them to his house later. The doctor promised to obey Clara's directions in every particular; he would start some time during the following day if not the first thing in the morning, and would bring back a faithful account of his experiences and of all he saw and heard. He was hastening off when he met Miss Rottermeyer just returning from a walk. He informed her of his intended journey, begging her in his most conciliatory voice to pack up the parcels for Heidi as she alone knew how to pack. And then he took his leave. Clara quite expected to have a long tussle with Miss Rottermeyer before she would get the latter to consent to sending all the things that she had collected as presents for Heidi. But this time she was mistaken, for Miss Rottermeyer was in a more than usually good temper. She cleared the large table so that all the things for Heidi could be spread out upon it and packed under Clara's own eyes. It was no light job, for the presents were of all shapes and sizes. First there was the little warm cloak with a hood, which had been designed by Clara herself, in order that Heidi during the coming winter might be able to go and see grandmother when she liked, and not have to wait till her grandfather could take her wrapped up in a sack to keep her from freezing. Then came a thick warm shawl for the grandmother, in which she could wrap herself well up and not feel the cold when the wind came sweeping in such terrible gusts round the house. The next object was the large box full of cakes; these were also for the grandmother, that she might have something to eat with her coffee besides bread. An immense sausage was the next article; this had been originally intended for Peter, who never had anything but bread and cheese, but Clara had altered her mind, fearing that in his delight he might eat it all up at once and make himself ill. So she arranged to send it to Brigitta, who could take some for herself and the grandmother and give Peter his portion out by degrees. A packet of tobacco was a present for grandfather, who was so fond of his pipe as he sat resting in the evening. Finally there was a whole lot of mysterious little bags, and parcels, and boxes, which Clara had had especial pleasure in collecting, as each was to be a joyful surprise for Heidi as she opened it. The work came to an end at last, and Clara eyed the big box with pleasure, picturing Heidi's exclamations and jumps of joy and surprise when the huge parcel arrived at the hut. Miss Rottermeyer packs the presents for Heidi. Sebastian came in, and lifting the package on to his shoulder, carried it off to be forwarded at once to the doctor's house. * * * CHAPTER XVI THE DOCTOR COMES WITH PRESENTS The early light of morning lay rosy red upon the mountains, and a fresh breeze rustled through the fir trees and set their ancient branches waving to and fro. The sound awoke Heidi and she jumped out of bed and dressed herself as quickly as she could. When she went down her ladder she found her grandfather had already left the hut. He was standing outside looking at the sky and examining the landscape as he did every morning, to see what sort of weather it was going to be. Little pink clouds were floating over the sky, that was growing brighter and bluer with every minute, while the heights and the meadow lands were turning gold under the rising sun, which was just appearing above the topmost peaks. ""O, how beautiful! how beautiful! Good-morning, Grandfather!"" cried Heidi, running out. ""What, you are awake already, are you?"" he answered, giving her a morning greeting. Then Heidi ran round to the fir trees to enjoy the sound she loved so well, and with every fresh gust of wind which came roaring through their branches she gave a fresh jump and cry of delight. Meanwhile the grandfather had gone to milk the goats; this done he brushed and washed them, ready for their mountain excursion, and brought them out of their shed. As soon as Heidi caught sight of them she ran and embraced them, and they bleated in return, while they vied with each other in showing their affection by poking their heads against her and trying which could get nearest her. When the lively Little Bear gave rather too violent a thrust, she only said, ""No, Little Bear, you are pushing like the Great Turk,"" and Little Bear immediately drew back his head and left off his rough attentions, while Little Swan lifted her head and put on an expression as much as to say, ""No one shall ever accuse me of behaving like the Great Turk."" Peter's whistle was heard and all the goats came along, leaping and springing, and Heidi soon found herself surrounded by the whole flock, pushed this way and that by their obstreperous greetings, but at last she managed to get through them to where Snowflake was standing, for the young goat had in vain striven to reach her. Peter now gave a last tremendous whistle, in order to startle the goats and drive them off, for he wanted to get near himself to say something to Heidi. The goats sprang aside and he came up to her. ""Can you come out with me today?"" he asked, evidently unwilling to hear her refuse. ""I am afraid I cannot, Peter,"" she answered. ""I am expecting them every minute from Frankfurt, and I must be at home when they come."" ""You have said the same thing for days now,"" grumbled Peter. ""I must continue to say it till they come,"" replied Heidi. ""How can you think, Peter, that I would be away when they came? As if I could do such a thing?"" ""They would find Uncle at home,"" he answered with a snarling voice. But at this moment the grandfather's stentorian voice was heard. ""Why is the army not marching forward? Is it the field-marshal who is missing or some of the troops?"" Whereupon Peter turned and went off, swinging his stick round so that it whistled through the air, and the goats, who understood the signal, started at full trot for their mountain pasture, Peter following in their wake. Since Heidi had come back to her grandfather she had learned to do many things about the house. She put her bed in order every morning, patting and stroking it till she had got it perfectly smooth and flat. Then she went about the room downstairs, put each chair back in its place, and if she found anything lying about she put it in the cupboard. After that she fetched a duster, climbed on a chair, and rubbed the table till it shone again. When the grandfather came in later he would look round well pleased and say to himself, ""We look like Sunday every day now; Heidi did not go abroad for nothing."" After Peter had departed and she and her grandfather had breakfasted, Heidi began her daily work as usual, but she did not get on with it very fast. It was so lovely out of doors today, and every minute something happened to interrupt her in her work. Now it was a bright beam of sun shining cheerfully through the open window, and seeming to say, ""Come out, Heidi, come out!"" Heidi felt she could not stay indoors, and she ran out in answer to the call. The sunlight lay sparkling on everything around the hut and on all the mountains and far away along the valley, and the grass slope looked so golden and inviting that she was obliged to sit down for a few minutes and look about her. Then she suddenly remembered that her stool was left standing in the middle of the floor and that the table had not been rubbed, and she jumped up and ran inside again. But it was not long before the fir trees began their old song; Heidi felt it in all her limbs, and again the desire to run outside was irresistible, and she was off to play and leap to the tune of the waving branches. The grandfather, who was busy in his work-shed, stepped out from time to time smiling to watch her at her gambols. He had just gone back to his work on one of these occasions when Heidi called out, ""Grandfather! Grandfather! Come, come!"" He stepped quickly out, almost afraid something had happened to the child, but he saw her running towards where the mountain path descended, crying, ""They are coming! they are coming! and the doctor is in front of them!"" Heidi rushed forward to welcome her old friend, who held out his hands in greeting to her. When she came up to him she clung to his outstretched arm, and exclaimed in the joy of her heart, ""Good-morning, doctor, and thank you ever so many times."" ""God bless you, child! what have you got to thank me for?"" asked the doctor, smiling. ""For being at home again with grandfather,"" the child explained. The doctor's face brightened as if a sudden ray of sunshine had passed across it; he had not expected such a reception as this. He had quite thought that Heidi would have forgotten him; she had seen so little of him, and he had felt rather like one bearing a message of disappointment. But instead, here was Heidi, her eyes dancing for joy, and full of gratitude and affection, clinging to the arm of her kind friend. He took her by the hand with fatherly tenderness. "" Take me now to your grandfather, Heidi, and show me where you live."" But Heidi still remained standing looking down the path with a questioning gaze. "" Where are Clara and grandmother?"" she asked. ""Ah, now I have to tell you something which you will be as sorry about as I am,"" answered the doctor. ""You see, Heidi, I have come alone. Clara was very ill and could not travel, and so the grandmother stayed behind too. But next spring, when the days grow warm and long again, they are coming here for certain."" Heidi stood motionless for a second or two, overcome by the unexpected disappointment. She suddenly remembered that the doctor had really come anyway. She lifted her eyes and saw the sad expression in his as he looked down at her; she had never seen him with that look on his face when she was in Frankfurt. It went to Heidi's heart; she could not bear to see anybody unhappy, especially her dear doctor. No doubt it was because Clara and grandmother could not come, and so she began to think how best she might console him. ""Oh, it won't be very long to wait for spring, and then they will be sure to come,"" she said in a reassuring voice. ""Time passes very quickly with us, and then they will be able to stay longer when they are here, and Clara will be pleased at that. Now let us go and find grandfather."" Hand in hand with her friend she climbed up to the hut. She was so anxious to make the doctor happy again that she began once more assuring him that the winter passed quickly on the mountain and that summer would be back again before they knew it, and she became so convinced of the truth of her own words that she called out quite cheerfully to her grandfather as they approached, ""They have not come today, but they will be here in a very short time."" * * * IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE FIR TREES BEGAN THEIR OLD SONG IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE FIR TREES BEGAN THEIR OLD SONG * * * The doctor was no stranger to the grandfather, for the child had talked to him so much about her friend. The old man held out his hand to his guest in friendly greeting. Then the two men sat down in front of the hut. The doctor whispered to Heidi that there was something being brought up the mountain which had traveled with him from Frankfurt, and which would give her even more pleasure than seeing him. Heidi got into a great state of excitement on hearing this, wondering what it could be. The old man urged the doctor to spend as many of the beautiful autumn days on the mountain as he could, and at least to come up whenever it was fine; he could not offer him a lodging, as he had no place to put him; he advised the doctor, however, not to go back to Ragatz, but to stay at Doerfli, where there was a clean, tidy little inn. Then the doctor could come up every morning, which would do him no end of good, and if he liked, he, the grandfather, would act as his guide to any part of the mountains he would like to see. The doctor was delighted with this proposal, and it was settled that it should be as the grandfather suggested. Alm-Uncle now rose and went indoors, returning in a few minutes with a table which he placed in front of the seat. ""There, Heidi, now run in and bring us what we want for the table,"" he said. ""The doctor must take us as he finds us; if the food is plain, he will acknowledge that the dining-room is pleasant."" ""I should think so indeed,"" replied the doctor as he looked down over the sun-lit valley, ""and I accept the kind invitation; everything must taste good up here."" Heidi ran backwards and forwards as busy as a bee and brought out everything she could find in the cupboard. The grandfather meanwhile had been preparing the meal, and now appeared with a steaming jug of milk and golden-brown toasted cheese. Then he cut some thin slices from the meat he had cured himself in the pure air, and the doctor enjoyed his dinner better than he had for a whole year past. ""Our Clara must certainly come up here,"" he said, ""it would make her quite a different person, and if she could eat for any length of time as I have today, she would grow plumper than any one has ever known her before."" As he spoke a man was seen coming up the path carrying a large package on his back. When he reached the hut he threw it on the ground and drew in two or three good breaths of the mountain air. ""Ah, here's what travelled with me from Frankfurt,"" said the doctor, rising, and he went up to the package and began undoing it, Heidi looking on in great expectation. After he had released it from its heavy outer covering, ""There, child,"" he said, ""now you can go on unpacking your treasures yourself."" Heidi undid her presents one by one until they were all displayed; she could not speak for wonder and delight. Not till the doctor opened the large box to show Heidi the cakes that were for the grandmother to eat with her coffee, did she at last give a cry of joy, exclaiming, ""Now grandmother will have nice things to eat,"" and she wanted to pack everything up again and start at once to give them to her. But the grandfather said he should walk down with the doctor that evening and she could go with them and take the things. Heidi next found the packet of tobacco which she ran and gave to her grandfather; he was so pleased with it that he immediately filled his pipe with some, and the two men then sat down together again, the smoke curling up from their pipes as they talked of all kinds of things, while Heidi continued to examine first one and then another of her presents. Suddenly she ran up to them, and standing in front of the doctor waited till there was a pause in the conversation, and then said, ""No, the presents have not given me more pleasure than seeing you, doctor."" The two men could not help laughing, and the doctor answered that he should never have thought it. As the sun began to sink behind the mountains the doctor rose, thinking it time to return to Doerfli and seek for quarters. The grandfather carried the cakes and the shawl and the large sausage, and the doctor took Heidi's hand, as they all three started down the mountain. Arrived at Peter's home Heidi bid the others good-bye; she was to wait at grandmother's till her grandfather, who was going on to Doerfli with his guest, returned for her. As the doctor shook hands with her she asked, ""Would you like to come out with the goats tomorrow morning?"" for she could think of no greater treat to offer him. ""Agreed!"" answered the doctor, ""we will go together."" Heidi now ran in to the grandmother: she first, with some effort, managed to carry in the box of cakes; then she ran out again and brought in the sausage—for her grandfather had put the presents down by the door—and then a third time for the shawl. She placed them as close as she could to the grandmother, so that the latter might be able to feel them and understand what was there. The shawl she laid over the old woman's knees. ""They are all from Frankfurt, from Clara and grandmamma,"" she explained to the astonished grandmother and Brigitta, the latter having watched her dragging in all the heavy things unable to imagine what was happening. ""And you are very pleased with the cakes, aren't you, Grandmother? taste how soft they are!"" said Heidi over and over again, to which the grandmother continued to answer, ""Yes, yes, Heidi, I should think so! what kind people they must be!"" And then she would pass her hand over the warm, thick shawl and add, ""This will be beautiful for the cold winter!"
"""Ich heiße nur Heidi und sonst nichts"", war Heidis Antwort.","""My name is Heidi and nothing else,"" was Heidi's answer.","""My name is Heidi and nothing else,"" was the child's answer. ""I'll call you Heidi then, for I like it very much,"" said Clara.","‘Everyone calls me Heidi, that’s my name,’ the little girl replied.","""I am never called anything but Heidi,"" was the child's prompt answer."
"Aber jetzt kam dem Heidi alles obenauf, was in ihm war, und brach hervor: ""Ich will ja nur heim, und wenn ich so lang nicht komme, so muss das Schneehöppli immer klagen, und die Großmutter erwartet mich, und der Distelfink bekommt die Rute, wenn der Geißenpeter keinen Käse bekommt, und hier kann man gar nie sehen, wie die Sonne gute Nacht sagt zu den Bergen; und wenn der Raubvogel in Frankfurt obenüber fliegen würde, so würde er noch viel lauter krächzen, dass so viele Menschen beieinander sitzen und einander bös machen und nicht auf den Felsen gehen, wo es einem wohl ist.""","But now everything that was in Heidi came out on top of him and burst out: ""I just want to go home, and if I don't come for so long, Schneehöppli always has to complain, and grandmother is expecting me, and goldfinch gets her Rute, when Peter the goat doesn't get any cheese, and here one can never see how the sun says good night to the mountains; and if the bird of prey were to fly overhead in Frankfurt, it would caw even louder that so many people together sit and make one another angry, and not go on the rocks where it is good.""","But Heidi could not bear it any longer. She loudly wailed: "" Oh, I want to go home. What will poor Snowhopper do without me? Grandmother is waiting for me every day. Poor Thistlefinch gets blows if Peter gets no cheese, and I must see the sun again when he says good-night to the mountains. How the eagle would screech if he saw all the people here in Frankfurt!""","and she burst out, ‘I want to go home because while I’m here Snowflake will be crying, and Grannie will be missing me too. And here I can’t see the sun saying goodnight to the mountains. And if the hawk came flying over Frankfurt he’d croak louder than ever because there are such a lot of people here being horrid and cross, instead of climbing high up where everything’s so much nicer.’","Then Heidi's feelings got the better of her, and she poured forth her trouble. "" Indeed I only want to go home, for if I stay so long away Snowflake will begin crying again, and grandmother is waiting for me, and Greenfinch will get beaten, because I am not there to give Peter any cheese, and I can never see here how the sun says good-night to the mountains; and if the great bird were to fly over Frankfurt he would croak louder than ever about people huddling all together and teaching each other bad things, and not going to live up on the rocks, where it is so much better."""
"Aber das wollte die Base gerade nicht und beschwichtigte das Kind, es solle nur schnell kommen jetzt, dass sie nicht noch zu spät kämen, sondern dass sie morgen weiterreisen könnten, es könnte ja dann sehen, wie es ihm gefallen werde in Frankfurt, dass es gar nie mehr fortwolle dort; und wenn es doch heim wolle, so könne es ja gleich gehen und dann erst noch der Großmutter etwas mit heimbringen, was sie freue. Das war eine Aussicht für Heidi, die ihm gefiel. Es fing an zu laufen ohne Widerstreben.","But the cousin just didn't want that and reassured the child that she should come quickly now, so that she wouldn't be too late, but that she could continue her journey tomorrow, she could then see how she would like it in Frankfurt, that it never wanting to leave there again; and if it does want to go home, it can go straight away and then bring something home for grandmother that will make her happy. That was a prospect for Heidi that pleased him. It started running without resistance.",But Deta would not let her go. She urged her on by saying that she might return soon again. She also suggested that Heidi might bring a lovely present to the grandmother when she came back. Heidi liked this prospect and followed Deta without more ado.,"Just you think of the wonderful time you’ll have in Frankfurt, and when you come back again – if indeed you ever want to, once you’re there – you can bring a present for Grannie.’ ‘Can I really?’ Heidi asked, pleased with this idea.","But Dete had no intention of letting the child go, and quieted her as best she could by promising that she could take something nice back to grandmother. This was a new idea to Heidi, and it pleased her so much that Dete had no longer any difficulty in getting her along. ""What could I take back to her?"""
"Heidi stand unter den wogenden Tannen und wartete auf den Großvater, der mitgehen und den Koffer vom Dörfli heraufholen wollte, während es bei der Großmutter wäre. Das Kind konnte es fast nicht erwarten, die Großmutter wieder zu sehen und zu hören, wie ihr die Brötchen geschmeckt hatten, und doch wurde ihm wieder die Zeit nicht lang, denn es konnte ja nicht genug die heimatlichen Töne von dem Tannenrauschen über ihm und das Duften und Leuchten der grünen Weiden und der goldenen Blumen darauf eintrinken.","Heidi stood under the swaying pine trees and waited for grandfather, who wanted to go and fetch the suitcase from Dörfli while it was at grandmother's. The child almost couldn't wait to see grandmother again and to hear how she liked the rolls, and yet it didn't take long for him again, because he couldn't get enough of the homely sounds of the rustling of the fir trees above him and all that Drink in the scent and glow of the green pastures and the golden flowers on it.","Heidi was standing under the swaying fir-trees, waiting for her grandfather to join her. He had promised to bring up her trunk from the village while she went in to visit the grandmother. The child was longing to see the blind woman again and to hear how she had liked the rolls.","Heidi stood under the swaying trees, waiting for her grandfather to go down the mountain with her. He was going to fetch her trunk from Dörfli while she visited Grannie. She was eager to get there, to hear how she had enjoyed the rolls but, listening to the familiar rustling of the trees with her eyes resting on the distant green pastures, she did not grow impatient.","The next afternoon Heidi was standing under the waving trees waiting for her grandfather, who was going down with her to grandmother's, and then on to Doerfli to fetch her trunk. She was longing to know how grandmother had enjoyed her white bread and impatient to see and hear her again."
"""Ja"", erwiderte Peter, ""und die zwei großen Stücke zum Essen sind auch dein, und wenn du ausgetrunken hast, bekommst du noch ein Schüsselchen vom Schwänli und dann komm ich.""","""Yes,"" replied Peter, ""and the two large pieces to eat are also yours, and when you've finished drinking, you get another bowl of Schwanli and then I'll come.""","When you are through with the milk, I'll get you some more. After that I'll get mine.""",I’ll get you another mugful from Daisy when you’ve drunk that one.

"Im Hause des Herrn Sesemann in Frankfurt lag das kranke Töchterlein, Klara, in dem bequemen Rollstuhl, in welchem es den ganzen Tag sich aufhielt und von einem Zimmer ins andere gestoßen wurde. Jetzt saß es im so genannten Studierzimmer, das neben der großen Essstube lag und wo vielerlei Gerätschaften herumstanden und -lagen, die das Zimmer wohnlich machten und zeigten, dass man hier gewöhnlich sich aufhielt. An dem großen, schönen Bücherschrank mit den Glastüren konnte man sehen, woher das Zimmer seinen Namen hatte und dass es wohl der Raum war, wo dem lahmen Töchterchen der tägliche Unterricht erteilt wurde.","At Herr Sesemann's house in Frankfurt, the sick little daughter, Klara, lay in the comfortable wheelchair, in which she spent the whole day and was pushed from one room to the other. Now it was sitting in the so-called study room, which was next to the large dining room and where all kinds of equipment stood and lay around, which made the room comfortable and showed that people usually stayed here. From the large, beautiful bookcase with the glass doors you could see where the room got its name from and that it was probably the room where the lame little daughter was given her daily lessons.","In a beautiful house in Frankfurt lived a sick child by the name of Clara Sesemann. She was sitting in a comfortable rolling-chair, which could be pushed from room to room. Clara spent most of her time in the study, where long rows of bookcases lined the walls. This room was used as a living-room, and here she was also given her lessons.","The house in Frankfurt to which Heidi was being taken belonged to a wealthy man called Mr Sesemann. His only daughter, Clara, was an invalid and spent all her days in a wheel‐chair, in which she was pushed wherever she wanted to go. She was a very patient child, with a thin, pale face and mild, blue eyes. Her mother had been dead for a long time, and since then her father had employed as housekeeper a worthy but very disagreeable person called Miss Rottenmeier. She looked after Clara and was in charge of all the servants. As Mr Sesemann was often away from home on business, he left all the household affairs in her hands, on the sole condition that Clara was never to be crossed in any way. On the evening when Heidi was expected, Clara was sitting, as she usually did, in a pleasant, comfortable room, next to the big dining‐room. It was called the study because of the big, glass‐fronted bookcase which stood against one wall, and it was here that Clara did her lessons.","CLARA, THE PATIENT LITTLE INVALID In her home at Frankfurt, Clara, the little daughter of Mr. Sesemann, was lying on the invalid couch on which she spent her whole day, being wheeled in it from room to room."

"Der Alm-Öhi war unterdessen an die Tür der Studierstube getreten und hatte angeklopft. Der Herr Pfarrer machte auf und trat dem Eintretenden entgegen, nicht überrascht, wie er wohl hätte sein können, sondern so, als habe er ihn erwartet; die ungewohnte Erscheinung in der Kirche musste ihm nicht entgangen sein. Er ergriff die Hand des Alten und schüttelte sie wiederholt mit der größten Herzlichkeit, und der Alm-Öhi stand schweigend da und konnte erst kein Wort herausbringen, denn auf solchen herzlichen Empfang war er nicht vorbereitet. Jetzt fasste er sich und sagte: ""Ich komme, um den Herrn Pfarrer zu bitten, dass er mir die Worte vergessen möchte, die ich zu ihm auf der Alm geredet habe, und dass er mir nicht nachtragen wolle, wenn ich widerspenstig war gegen seinen wohlmeinenden Rat. Der Herr Pfarrer hat ja in allem Recht gehabt und ich war im Unrecht, aber ich will jetzt seinem Rate folgen und auf den Winter wieder ein Quartier im Dörfli beziehen, denn die harte Jahreszeit ist nichts für das Kind dort oben, es ist zu zart, und wenn auch dann die Leute hier unten mich von der Seite ansehen, so wie einen, dem nicht zu trauen ist, so habe ich es nicht besser verdient, und der Herr Pfarrer wird es ja nicht tun.""","Meanwhile Alm-Öhi had come to the door of the study and knocked. The pastor opened the door and met the newcomer, not surprised, as he might have been, but as if he had been expecting him; the unusual appearance in the church must not have escaped him. He took the old man's hand and shook it repeatedly with the greatest cordiality, and Alm-Öhi stood there in silence and at first couldn't utter a word, for he wasn't prepared for such a warm welcome. Now he composed himself and said: ""I come to ask the pastor to forget the words I spoke to him on the mountain pasture and not to hold grudges against me if I was stubborn against his Well-meaning advice The pastor was right about everything and I was wrong, but I want to follow his advice now and move into quarters in Dörfli again for the winter, because the hard season is nothing for the child up there, it is too tender, and even if the people down here look at me from the side, like someone who can't be trusted, I don't deserve it better, and the pastor won't do it.""","The clergyman had opened the door and received them with friendly words. ""I have come to ask your forgiveness for my harsh words,"" said the uncle. ""I want to follow your advice to spend the winter here among you. If the people look at me askance, I can't expect any better.","Now when Uncle Alp had gone inside the pastor’s house, he knocked on the study door and the pastor came out, looking quite as though he had expected the visit – for of course he had seen them in church. He shook hands with Uncle Alp so warmly that at first the lonely old man could hardly speak. He had not expected such kindness. When he had collected himself, he said: ‘I’ve come to ask you to forget what I said when you called on me that time, and not to hold it against me that I wouldn’t take your friendly advice. You were quite right and I was wrong. I shall do as you suggested and move down to Dörfli for the winter. The weather is too severe then for the child to be up in the hut. And if the people down here do regard me with suspicion, that’s no more than I deserve; and I know you won’t do so.’","Meanwhile Alm-Uncle had gone into the pastor's house and knocked at the study door. The pastor came out and shook hands warmly with him, and Alm-Uncle was unable at first to speak, for he had not expected such a friendly reception. At last he collected himself and said, ""I have come to ask you, pastor, to forget the words I spoke to you when you called on me, and to beg you not to owe me ill-will for having been so obstinately set against your well-meant advice. You were right, and I was wrong, but I have now made up my mind to follow your advice and to find a place for myself at Doerfli for the winter, for the child is not strong enough to stand the bitter cold up on the mountain. And if the people down here look askance at me, as at a person not to be trusted, I know it is my own fault."""
"""Es nützt nichts, der liebe Gott hat nicht zugehört, und ich glaube es auch wohl"", fuhr Heidi in einiger Aufregung weiter, ""wenn nun am Abend so viele, viele Leute in Frankfurt alle miteinander beten, so kann der liebe Gott ja nicht auf alle Acht geben, und mich hat er gewiss gar nicht gehört.""","""It's no use, the dear Lord wasn't listening, and I think so, too,"" Heidi continued in some excitement, ""when so many, many people in Frankfurt are all praying together in the evening, the dear Lord can't keep an eye out for everyone, and he certainly didn't hear me at all.""","""It does not help, for God has not listened. I don't wonder,"" she added, ""for if all the people in Frankfurt pray every night, He cannot listen to them all. I am sure He has not heard me.""","‘It’s no use,’ Heidi told her. ‘ God didn’t hear me and I daresay that if all the people in Frankfurt pray for things at the same time, He can’t notice everybody and I’m sure He didn’t hear me.’","""It is of no use, God does not listen,"" Heidi went on in an agitated voice, ""and I can understand that when there are so many, many people in Frankfurt praying to Him every evening that He cannot attend to them all, and He certainly has not heard what I said to Him."""

""What a thankless child you are, just idle and good-for-nothing!""",‘You have everything you can want here. You’re an ungrateful little girl who doesn’t know when she’s well off.’ This was too much for Heidi,"""I should think not, indeed!"" continued the exasperated lady. ""You are an ungrateful little thing to be always thinking of what naughty thing you can do next!"""
"""Es ist ein Junge da, der durchaus an Fräulein Klara selbst etwas zu bestellen hat"", berichtete Sebastian.","""There's a boy there who really has something to say to Miss Klara himself,"" reported Sebastian.","Knocking at the study-door, Sebastian said, when he had entered: ""A boy is here who wants to see Miss Clara.""","‘There’s a boy here who wants to speak to Miss Clara personally,’ he announced.","""There is a boy outside who says he must speak to Miss Clara herself,"" Sebastian announced."
"Der Türmer wollte nun weitergehen, aber Heidi konnte sich von dem unterhaltenden Schauspiel fast nicht trennen.","The watchman now wanted to go on, but Heidi could hardly tear herself away from the entertaining spectacle.","Do you belong to Mr. Sesemann?""",The keeper was ready to go down the rest of the way but Heidi couldn’t tear herself away. ‘,"""No, but Clara will be so delighted when I take her the kittens."""
"Aber jetzt stieg der Zorn der Dame. ""Wie, Adelheid"", rief sie in immer höheren Tönen, ""du unterstehst dich noch, nach aller Ungezogenheit einen schlechten Spaß zu machen?

Be careful, I tell you!""","Your behavior was very remiss. The idea of walking about till so late!"" ""Meow!"" was the reply.","‘Miaou,’ came the reply, which seemed to be Heidi’s, and that was the last straw. ‘How dare you mock me in such a fashion, and after such disgraceful behaviour,’ said Miss Rottenmeier, her temper rising. ‘I didn’t,’ began Heidi, but got no further before there was another ‘Miaou, Miaou!’","This was too much for the lady's temper; with raised voice she exclaimed, ""You dare, Adelaide, after your bad behavior, to answer me as if it were a joke?""

"Heidi war außer sich vor Freude, alle die alten Gefährten wieder zu haben; es umarmte das kleine, zärtliche Schneehöppli wieder und wieder und streichelte den stürmischen Distelfink und wurde vor großer Liebe und Zutraulichkeit der Geißen hin und her gedrängt und geschoben, bis es nun ganz in Peters Nähe kam, der noch immer auf demselben Platze stand.","Heidi was overjoyed at having all her old companions back; again and again she hugged the little, tender Schneehöppli and stroked the boisterous goldfinch and was pushed and pushed back and forth by the goats out of great love and trust until she came very close to Peter, who was still standing in the same place.","Heidi was beside herself with joy, and caressed little Snowhopper and patted Thistlefinch, till she felt herself pushed to and fro among them.","Heidi was delighted to see them all again. She put an arm round one and patted another. The animals pushed her this way and that with their affectionate nudgings, but at last she came to Peter’s side.","The impatient Greenfinch sprang into the air and over two of her companions in order to get nearer, and even the shy little Snowflake butted the Great Turk out of her way in quite a determined manner, which left him standing taken aback by her boldness, and lifting his beard in the air as much as to say,"

"""Ach, du gutes Kind"", sagte die Großmutter, ""sehen kann ich es nicht, aber hören kann ich es wohl und noch viel mehr, nicht nur den Laden; da kracht und klappert es überall, wenn der Wind kommt, und er kann überall hereinblasen; es hält nichts mehr zusammen, und in der Nacht, wenn sie beide schlafen, ist es mir manchmal so angst und bang, es falle alles über uns zusammen und schlage uns alle drei tot; ach, und da ist kein Mensch, der etwas ausbessern könnte an der Hütte, der Peter versteht's nicht.""","""Oh, you good child,"" said the grandmother, ""I can't see it, but I can certainly hear it and much more besides, not just the shop; there's a banging and rattling everywhere when the wind comes, and it can blow in everywhere; nothing holds together anymore, and at night, when they are both sleeping, I am sometimes so scared and afraid that everything will collapse on us and kill all three of us; oh, and there is no one there could fix something in the hut, Peter doesn't understand.""","""What a sweet child you are,"" said the grandmother tenderly.

"Klara war sehr schmerzlich überrascht von der Mitteilung und wollte erst allerlei Auswege finden, aber es half nichts, der Vater blieb fest bei seinem Entschluss, versprach aber, im nächsten Jahre mit Klara nach der Schweiz zu reisen, wenn sie nun recht vernünftig sei und keinen Jammer erhebe. So ergab sich Klara in das Unvermeidliche, begehrte aber zum Ersatz, dass der Koffer für Heidi in ihr Zimmer gebracht und da gepackt werde, damit sie hineinstecken könne, was ihr Freude mache, was der Papa sehr gern bewilligte, ja er ermunterte Klara noch, dem Kinde eine schöne Aussteuer zurechtzumachen. Unterdessen war die Base Dete angelangt und stand in großer Erwartung im Vorzimmer, denn dass sie um diese ungewöhnliche Zeit einberufen worden war, musste etwas Außerordentliches bedeuten. Herr Sesemann trat zu ihr heraus und erklärte ihr, wie es mit Heidi stehe und dass er wünsche, sie möchte das Kind sofort, gleich heute noch, nach Hause bringen. Die Base sah sehr enttäuscht aus; diese Nachricht hatte sie nicht erwartet. Sie erinnerte sich auch noch recht wohl der Worte, die ihr der Öhi mit auf den Weg gegeben hatte, dass sie ihm nie mehr vor die Augen kommen solle, und so das Kind dem Alten einmal bringen und dann nehmen und dann wiederbringen, das schien ihr nicht ganz geraten zu sein. Sie besann sich also nicht lange, sondern sagte mit großer Beredsamkeit, heute wäre es ihr leider völlig unmöglich, die Reise anzutreten, und morgen könnte sie noch weniger daran denken, und die Tage darauf wäre es am allerunmöglichsten, um der darauf folgenden Geschäfte willen, und nachher könnte sie dann gar nicht mehr. Herr Sesemann verstand die Sprache und entließ die Base ohne weiteres. Nun ließ er den Sebastian vortreten und erklärte ihm, er habe sich unverzüglich zur Reise zu rüsten; heute habe er mit dem Kinde bis nach Basel zu fahren, morgen bringe er es heim. Dann könne er sogleich wieder umkehren, zu berichten habe er nichts, ein Brief an den Großvater werde diesem alles erklären.","Klara was very painfully surprised by the news and first wanted to find all sorts of ways out, but it didn't help, her father stuck to his decision, but promised to travel to Switzerland with Klara next year, if she was really sensible and didn't do anything raise misery. So Klara gave in to the inevitable, but in return she requested that Heidi's suitcase be taken to her room and packed there so that she could put in it whatever pleased her, which Papa was very happy to agree to, yes he encouraged Klara to to prepare a nice dowry for the child. Meanwhile the courier Dete had arrived and was standing in the antechamber in great expectation, for the fact that she had been summoned at this unusual time must mean something extraordinary. Herr Sesemann came out to her and explained how things were with Heidi and that he wanted her to bring the child home immediately, today. The base looked very disappointed; she hadn't expected this news. She also remembered quite well the words that Öhi had given her, that he should never see her again, and so bring the child to the old man once and then take it and then bring it back, that seemed to her not quite advised. So she didn't think twice, but said with great eloquence that today it would unfortunately be completely impossible for her to start the journey, and tomorrow she would be even less able to think about it, and the days after that it would be the most impossible thing of all, for the sake of the business that would follow, and afterwards she couldn't do it anymore. Mr. Sesemann understood the language and dismissed the base without further ado. Now he let Sebastian step forward and told him that he had to get ready for the journey at once; Today he has to take the child to Basel, tomorrow he will bring it home. Then he could turn back immediately, he had nothing to report, a letter to grandfather would explain everything to him.","Clara was painfully surprised and tried to prevent her father from carrying out his plan. He remained firm, however, promising to take her to Switzerland himself the following summer, if she was good and sensible now. So the child, resigning herself, begged to have Heidi's trunk packed in her room. Mr. Sesemann encouraged her to get together a good outfit for her little friend. Heidi's aunt had arrived in the meantime. Being told to take her niece home with her, she found no end of excuses, which plainly showed that she did not want to do it; for Deta well remembered the uncle's parting words. Mr. Sesemann dismissed her and summoned Sebastian. The butler was told to get ready for travelling with the child. He was to go to Basle that day and spend the night at a good hotel which his master named. The next day the child was to be brought to her home.","Clara was very distressed at this news and tried hard to make her father change his mind, but he stood firm, only promising that if she was sensible and did not make a fuss, he would take her to Switzerland the following year. Then, seeing there were no two ways about it, she gave in, but she begged that, as a small consolation, Heidi’s trunk should be brought to her room to be packed, so that she could put in some nice things which Heidi would like. To this her father willingly agreed. By this time Detie had arrived and was wondering uneasily why she had been sent for at such an unearthly hour. Mr Sesemann repeated to her what he had learnt about Heidi’s condition. ‘I want you to take her home at once, this very day,’ he said. Detie was very upset, remembering how Uncle Alp had told her never to show her face again upon the mountain. To have to take Heidi back to him like this, after the way she had carried her off, was asking too much of her. ‘Please do excuse me,’ she said glibly, ‘but it is not possible for me to go today, nor yet tomorrow. We’re very busy, and I really couldn’t even ask for the day off just now. Indeed, I don’t quite know when I could manage it.’ Mr Sesemann saw through her excuses, and sent her away without another word. He told Sebastian instead to prepare himself at once for a journey. ‘You’ll take the child as far as Basle today,’ he said, ‘and go on with her to her home tomorrow. I’ll give you a letter for her grandfather so there will be no need for you to explain anything and you can come straight back here.","And so they had decided to send her home at once, as he did not like to take the responsibility of her remaining, and Clara would see for herself that it was the only thing to do. Clara was very much distressed, and at first made all kinds of suggestions for keeping Heidi with her; but her father was firm, and promised her, if she would be reasonable and make no further fuss, that he would take her to Switzerland next summer. Next he sent for Sebastian and told him to make ready to start: he was to travel with Heidi as far as Basle that day, and the next day take her home. He would give him a letter to carry to the grandfather, which would explain everything, and he could then return to Frankfurt."
"""Das gehört dir"", sagte dieser und legte die Rolle neben sich auf die Bank. Dann nahm er den Brief und las ihn durch: Ohne ein Wort zu sagen, steckte er dann das Blatt in die Tasche.","""That's yours,"" he said, putting the scroll down on the bench next to him. Then he took the letter and read it through: without saying a word, he then put the sheet in his pocket.","""This belongs to you,"" he said, laying the roll beside him. Having read the letter, he put it in his pocket.","‘The packet is for you,’ he said, laying it on the bench. Then he read the letter and put it in his pocket without a word.","""That belongs to you,"" he said, laying the roll of money down on the bench beside him. Then he opened the letter, read it through, and without a word put it in his pocket."
"Aber Herr Sesemann hatte keine Erklärungen im Sinn; er ließ die Dame stehen, wo sie stand, und ging nach dem Zimmer seiner Tochter. Wie er vermutet hatte, war diese durch die ungewöhnliche Bewegung im Hause wach geworden und lauschte nach allen Seiten hin, was wohl vorgehe. Der Vater setzte sich nun an ihr Bett und erzählte ihr den ganzen Verlauf der Geistererscheinung und dass Heidi nach des Doktors Ausspruch sehr angegriffen sei und wohl nach und nach seine nächtlichen Wanderungen ausdehnen, vielleicht gar das Dach besteigen würde, was dann mit den höchsten Gefahren verbunden wäre. Er habe also beschlossen, das Kind sofort heimzuschicken, denn solche Verantwortung könne er nicht auf sich nehmen, und Klara müsse sich dareinfinden, sie sehe ja ein, dass es nicht anders sein könne.","But Herr Sesemann had no explanations in mind; he left the lady where she was and went to his daughter's room. As he had suspected, she had been awakened by the unusual movement in the house and was listening on all sides to see what was going on. The father now sat down by her bed and told her the whole course of the apparition and that, according to the doctor, Heidi was very ill and would probably gradually extend her nocturnal wanderings, perhaps even climb the roof, which would then involve the greatest dangers would. So he had decided to send the child home immediately, because he couldn't take on such a responsibility, and Klara had to get used to it, she saw that it couldn't be any other way.","But Mr. Sesemann, evidently not in the mood to converse further, went to his daughter's room. Clara had been wakened by the unusual noises and was listening eagerly. Her father told her of what had happened and how the doctor had ordered Heidi back to her home, because her condition was serious and might get worse. She might even climb the roof, or be exposed to similar dangers, if she was not cured at once.","But Mr Sesemann left her, without saying anything further, and went to Clara’s bedroom. As he expected, she had been awakened by all the commotion and was most anxious to know what had happened, so he sat down at her bedside and told her the whole story, ending up, ‘Dr Classen is afraid Heidi’s health has suffered, and says she might even go up on the roof in her sleep. You can understand how dangerous that would be. So I’ve made up my mind that she must go home at once. We can’t risk anything happening to her, can we?’","But Mr. Sesemann had no thought or time for explanations and left her standing there while he went to speak to Clara. He told her everything that had occurred during the past night, and explained how Heidi's nightly wanderings might gradually lead her farther and farther, perhaps even on to the roof, which of course would be very dangerous for her. And so they had decided to send her home at once, as he did not like to take the responsibility of her remaining, and Clara would see for herself that it was the only thing to do."
"""Für immer? Auch wenn ich heimgehe?"", fragte Heidi ganz rot vor Freude.","""Forever? Even if I go home?"" Asked Heidi, red with joy.","""Forever? Also when I am going home?"" Heidi inquired, confused with joy.","‘For ever and ever? Even when I go home?’ asked Heidi, flushing with pleasure.","""Mine, to keep always? even when I go home?"" said Heidi, blushing with pleasure."
"""Frisches?"", fragte Heidi.","""Fresh?"" asked Heidi.","""Fresh water?""",‘Fresh water?’,"""Excuse me, my dear sir, do not disturb yourself, but I must—I think my daughter will be wanting me,"" and with that Mr. Sesemann quickly left the room and went into the study to talk to Clara."
"Heidi sprang eilig herein, und Sebastian schlug die Tür zu; den Jungen, der verblüfft draußen stand, hatte er gar nicht bemerkt.","Heidi hurried in, and Sebastian slammed the door; he hadn't even noticed the boy standing outside in amazement.","Heidi went in, and the boy was left outside, for Sebastian had not even seen him.","Come in quickly,’ he cried as soon as he saw her, and he slammed the door without even noticing the boy, who was left outside feeling quite bewildered.","Heidi sprang hastily in and Sebastian shut the door after her, leaving the boy, whom he had not noticed, standing in wonder on the steps."
"""Weiß schon"", war die Antwort. ""Der Alm-Öhi putzt und wäscht sie und gibt ihnen Salz und hat den schönsten Stall.""","""I know,"" was the reply. ""The Alm-Öhi cleans and washes them and gives them salt and has the most beautiful stable.""","She mentioned it to Peter, who replied: ""I know! Of course they are the prettiest, because the uncle washes them and gives them salt. He has the best stable by far.""","‘I know. That’s Uncle – he keeps them very clean and gives them salt and he has a fine stall for them,’ he replied.","""Yes, I know they are,"" was the answer. "" Alm-Uncle brushes them down and washes them and gives them salt, and he has the nicest shed for them."""
"Dete tat, wie ihr geheißen war, und der Bediente des Hauses kam die Treppe herunter mit großen, runden Knöpfen auf seinem Aufwärterrock und fast ebenso großen runden Augen im Kopfe.","Dete did as she was told, and the servant of the house came down the stairs with big round buttons on his dressing gown and almost as big round eyes in his head.","Sebastian, the butler, a man with large brass buttons on his coat, soon stood before her.","Detie did so and presently a manservant came hurrying downstairs. He wore a smart coat with big round buttons, and his eyes were as round and big as the buttons.","Tinette, the maid in dainty cap and apron, ushered them upstairs into the library."
"""Nach Frankfurt"", erklärte Dete, ""da bekomm ich einen extraguten Dienst. Die Herrschaft war schon im vorigen Sommer unten im Bad, ich habe ihre Zimmer auf meinem Gang gehabt und sie besorgt, und schon damals wollten sie mich mitnehmen, aber ich konnte nicht fortkommen, und jetzt sind sie wieder da und wollen mich mitnehmen, und ich will auch gehen, da kannst du sicher sein.""","""To Frankfurt,"" Dete explained, ""I'll get an extra good service there. Last summer my family was downstairs in the baths, I had their rooms in my corridor and they got them, and even then they wanted to take me with them, but I was able to can't get away, and now they're back and want to take me with them, and I want to go too, you can be sure of that.""","""I am going to a splendid house in Frankfurt. Last summer some people went off to the baths and I took care of their rooms. As they got to like me, they wanted to take me along, but I could not leave.

Last summer they stayed in the hotel at Ragaz where I’ve been working as chambermaid. They had rooms on the floor I look after. They wanted to take me back with them then, but I couldn’t get away.

""I am glad I am not the child,"" exclaimed Barbel."
"""So, General, nun warst du im Feuer und brauchst Stärkung, komm, halt mit!"" Damit stand der Großvater auf und holte das Abendessen aus dem Schrank hervor, und Heidi rückte die Stühle zum Tisch. Unterdessen war auch eine Bank an die Wand gezimmert worden vom Großvater; nun er nicht mehr allein war, hatte er da und dort allerlei Sitze zu zweien eingerichtet, denn Heidi hatte die Art, dass es sich überall nah zum Großvater hielt, wo er ging und stand und saß. So hatten sie alle drei gut Platz zum Sitzen und der Peter tat seine runden Augen ganz weit auf, als er sah, welch ein mächtiges Stück von dem schönen getrockneten Fleisch der Alm-Öhi ihm auf seine dicke Brotschnitte legte. So gut hatte es der Peter lange nicht gehabt. Als nun das vergnügte Mahl zu Ende war, fing es an zu dunkeln, und Peter schickte sich zur Heimkehr an. Als er nun ""Gute Nacht"" und ""Dank Euch Gott"" gesagt hatte und schon unter der Tür war, kehrte er sich noch einmal um und sagte: ""Am Sonntag komm ich wieder, heut über acht Tag, und du solltest auch einmal zur Großmutter kommen, hat sie gesagt.""","""So, general, now you were in the fire and need refreshment, come along!"" With that Grandfather got up and took the dinner out of the cupboard, and Heidi pushed the chairs to the table. Meanwhile, grandfather had also built a bench against the wall; Now that he was no longer alone, he had set up all kinds of seats for two here and there, for Heidi was such that wherever he went, stood or sat, she kept close to her grandfather. So all three of them had plenty of space to sit and Peter opened his round eyes wide when he saw what a huge piece of the beautiful dried meat Alm-Öhi put on his thick slice of bread. Peter hadn't had it so good for a long time. When the happy meal was over, it began to get dark, and Peter prepared to return home. When he had said ""Good night"" and ""Thank you God"" and was already in the door, he turned around again and said: ""I'll be back on Sunday, more than eight days today, and you should also go to grandmother's come, she said.""","Come and join us at supper."" With that the old man prepared a meal which amply satisfied Peter's appetite. It had begun to get dark, and Peter knew that it was time to go. He had said good-bye and thank you, when turning to Heidi he remarked: ""I'll come next Sunday, if I may.","‘Well, General, you’ve been under fire, now you’ll need some refreshment,’ he said. He soon had supper ready and Heidi put chairs round the table. The hut was less bare now than when she first arrived, for Grandfather had made one bench which was fixed to the wall and other seats big enough for two people, for Heidi always liked to be close beside him. Now they could all sit down in comfort, and as Peter did so, he opened his round eyes very wide at the huge piece of dried meat Uncle Alp put on a thick slice of bread for him. It was a long time since he had had such a good meal. As soon as they had finished eating Peter got ready to go, for it was growing dark. ‘Goodbye,’ he said, ‘and thank you. I’ll come again next Sunday, and Grannie says she would like you to come and see her.’","""Well, now, General, you have been under fire for some time and must want some refreshment. Come and join us,"" said the grandfather as he brought the supper out of the cupboard, and Heidi pushed the stools to the table. There was also now a bench fastened against the wall, for as he was no longer alone the grandfather had put up seats of various kinds here and there, long enough to hold two persons, for Heidi had a way of always keeping close to her grandfather whether he was walking, sitting, or standing. Peter opened his round eyes very wide when he saw what a large piece of meat Alm-Uncle gave him on his thick slice of bread. It was a long time since Peter had had anything so nice to eat. As soon as the pleasant meal was over he began to get ready for returning home, for it was already growing dark. He had said his ""good-night"" and his thanks, and was just going out, when he turned and said, ""I shall come again next Sunday, this day week, and my grandmother sent word that she would like you to come and see her some day."""
"""O ja, ich will schon"", kam jetzt heraus, und nun war Heidi dunkelrot geworden.","""Oh yes, I want to,"" came out now, and now Heidi had turned dark red.","""Oh yes, I should like to,"" said the blushing child.","‘Oh yes, I am,’ she said fervently, and the colour came into her cheeks.","""Oh, yes, yes!"" exclaimed Heidi, her face now rosy with delight."

"Wieder unten in die Wachtstube eingetreten, ließ er sich dem harrenden Freunde gegenüber in den Lehnstuhl nieder und erklärte dem mit gespannter Erwartung Lauschenden: ""Sesemann, dein kleiner Schützling ist erstens mondsüchtig; völlig unbewusst hat er dir allnächtlich als Gespenst die Haustür aufgemacht und deiner ganzen Mannschaft die Fieber des Schreckens ins Gebein gejagt. Zweitens wird das Kind vom Heimweh verzehrt, so dass es schon jetzt fast zum Geripplein abgemagert ist und es noch völlig werden würde; also schnelle Hilfe! Für das erste Übel und die in hohem Grade stattfindende Nervenaufregung gibt es nur ein Heilmittel, nämlich, dass du sofort das Kind in die heimatliche Bergluft zurückversetzest; für das zweite gibt's ebenfalls nur _eine_ Medizin, nämlich ganz dieselbe. Demnach reist das Kind morgen ab, das ist mein Rezept.""","Having re-entered the guard room, he sat down in the armchair opposite his friend who was waiting and explained to those who were listening with tense expectation: ""Sesemann, your little protégé is first of all moonstruck; completely unconsciously he opened the front door for you every night as a ghost and for all of you ""Secondly, the child is consumed by homesickness, so that it is already almost a mere skeleton and would become whole; so quick help! For the first evil and the high degree of nervous excitement that is taking place there is only one remedy, namely that you immediately take the child back to the mountain air of its home; for the second there is also only _one_ medicine, namely exactly the same. So the child is leaving tomorrow, that's my prescription.""","Joining his anxious friend down-stairs, he said: ""Sesemann, the little girl is a sleep-walker, and has unconsciously scared your whole household. Besides, she is so home-sick that her little body has wasted away. We shall have to act quickly. The only remedy for her is to be restored to her native mountain air. This is my prescription, and she must go tomorrow.""","‘Well, in the first place your little foster‐child is a sleepwalker,’ he began. ‘Without knowing anything about it, she has been opening the front door every night and frightening the servants out of their wits. In the second place she’s terribly homesick, and appears to have lost a great deal of weight, for she’s really not much more than skin and bone. Something must be done at once. She’s very, upset and her nerves are in a bad state. There’s only one cure for that sort of trouble – to send her back to her native mountains, and immediately. She should leave for home tomorrow – that’s my prescription.’","Secondly, the child is consumed with home-sickness to such an extent that she is nearly a skeleton already, and soon will be quite one; something must be done at once. There is but one remedy and that is to send her back to her native mountain air. So tomorrow the child must start for home; there you have my prescription."""
"Heidi trat heran, und mit seiner klaren Stimme sagte es sehr deutlich: ""Guten Tag, Frau Gnädige.""","Heidi approached, and in her clear voice said very clearly: ""Hello, madam.""","To the housekeeper's great mortification, she called the child Heidi, remarking to Miss Rottenmeier: ""If somebody's name is Heidi, I call her so.""","Heidi went to her and said clearly and carefully, ‘Good evening, Madam Gracious.’","Heidi walked up to her and said very distinctly in her clear voice, ""Good-evening, Mrs. Madam."""
"Die Brigitte war höchlich erfreut über das unerwartete Urteil. ""Er ist gewiss mehr als zehn Franken wert, seht nur!"", und in ihrer Freude streckte sie das Hütchen hoch auf. ""Was aber auch dieses Heidi für einen Segen von Frankfurt mit heimgebracht hat! Ich habe schon manchmal denken müssen, ob ich nicht den Peterli auch ein wenig nach Frankfurt schicken solle; was meint Ihr, Öhi?""","Brigitte was delighted with the unexpected verdict. ""He's certainly worth more than ten francs, just look!"", and in her joy she held up the little hat. ""But what a blessing this Heidi brought home from Frankfurt! I've sometimes had to think whether I shouldn't send Peterli to Frankfurt a little too; what do you think, Öhi?""","""What blessings this child has brought from Frankfurt,"" Brigida said. ""I often wondered if I should not send our little Peter too.","Bridget was delighted. Holding the hat up, she exclaimed, ‘Just fancy, it must be worth quite a lot of money. How well Heidi got on in Frankfurt. I wonder if it would be any good sending Peter there for a while. What do you think, Uncle?’","Mr. Sesemann, who had listened to the doctor in sad and submissive silence, now suddenly jumped up. "" Doctor,"" he said, ""tell me truly: have you really any hope for her final recovery?"" The doctor shrugged his shoulders. "" Very little,"" he replied quietly. "" But, friend, think of my trouble. You still have a beloved child to look for you and greet you on your return home."

Then he came back and put a big, heavy, linen sack on the ground.","""Just wait one minute,"" he said, and went down to his own bed.

He returned to the loft with a large, thick sack, made of flax, which he laid tidily over the bed."

"Fräulein Rottenmeier blieb vor Überraschung wie in den Boden eingewurzelt stehen und starrte Herrn Sesemann an. Sie hatte erwartet, er wolle ihr im Vertrauen die Mitteilung einer schauerlichen Geistergeschichte machen, die er in der Nacht erlebt und die sie eben jetzt bei dem hellen Morgenlicht nicht ungern gehört hätte; stattdessen diese völlig prosaischen und dazu noch sehr unbequemen Aufträge. So schnell konnte sie das Unerwartete nicht bewältigen. Sprachlos stand sie immer noch da und erwartete ein Weiteres.","Fraulein Rottenmeier stopped dead in her tracks and stared at Herr Sesemann. She had expected him to tell her in confidence about a horrible ghost story that he had experienced in the night and that she would not have been unwilling to hear just now in the bright morning light; instead these completely prosaic and very uncomfortable assignments. She couldn't handle the unexpected so quickly. She still stood there speechless, expecting something else.","Mr. Sesemann instructed the housekeeper to pack a trunk in all haste for Heidi. Miss Rottenmeier experienced an extreme disappointment, for she had hoped for an explanation of the great mystery.","Miss Rottenmeier was so astonished that she just stood and stared at him. She had been expecting him to tell her some terrible story about the ghost (which she would not have minded hearing by daylight). Instead she was met with these extremely businesslike (if rather inconvenient) orders. She could not understand it, and simply waited blankly for some sort of explanation.",Miss Rottermeyer stood as if rooted to the spot and stared in astonishment at Mr. Sesemann. She had quite expected a long private account of some terrible ghostly experience of his during the night. But Mr. Sesemann had no thought or time for explanations and left her standing there while he went to speak to Clara.

"""Jungfer Dete"", sagte Fräulein Rottenmeier nach einigen Minuten, in denen sie nach Fassung rang, ""es ist alles nicht nach Abrede, wie konnten Sie mir dieses Wesen zuführen?"" Aber die Dete ließ sich nicht so bald einschüchtern; sie antwortete herzhaft: ""Mit Erlaubnis der Dame, das Kind ist gerade, was ich dachte, dass sie haben wolle; die Dame hat mir beschrieben, wie es sein müsse, so ganz apart und nicht wie die anderen, und so musste ich das Kleine nehmen, denn die Größeren sind bei uns dann nicht mehr so apart, und ich dachte, dieses passe wie gemacht auf die Beschreibung. Jetzt muss ich aber gehen, denn meine Herrschaft erwartet mich; ich will, wenn's meine Herrschaft erlaubt, bald wieder kommen und nachsehen, wie es geht mit ihm."" Mit einem Knicks war die Dete zur Tür hinaus und die Treppe hinunter mit schnellen Schritten. Fräulein Rottenmeier stand einen Augenblick noch da, dann lief sie der Dete nach; es war ihr wohl in den Sinn gekommen, dass sie noch eine Menge von Dingen mit der Base besprechen wollte, wenn das Kind wirklich dableiben sollte, und da war es doch nun einmal und, wie sie bemerkte, hatte die Base fest im Sinn, es dazulassen.","""Jungfer Dete,"" said Fraulein Rottenmeier after a few minutes, in which she struggled to regain her composure, ""everything is not by agreement, how could you bring this being to me?"" But Dete wasn't easily intimidated; she replied heartily: ""With the lady's permission, the child is just what I thought she wanted; the lady described to me what it must be like, very different and not like the others, so I had to have the little one because the older ones aren't so special anymore, and I thought this fitted the description perfectly. But now I have to go, because my master is expecting me; I want to come back soon, if my master allows it see how he's doing."" With a curtsey, Dete was out the door and down the stairs with quick steps. Fraulein Rottenmeier stood there for a moment, then ran after Dete; it must have crossed her mind that if the child was really to stay there she would want to discuss a lot of things with the nephew, and there it was and, she noticed, the nephew had it in mind allow.","""Miss Deta, how could you bring this child?"" said the housekeeper, when she was more composed. Deta, however, was not easily intimidated, and said: ""I am sorry, but I thought this child would suit you. She is small, but older children are often spoilt and not like her. I must go now, for my mistress is waiting. As soon as I can, I'll come to see how the child is getting along."" With a bow she was outside and with a few quick steps hurried down-stairs. Miss Rottenmeier followed her and tried to call her back, for she wanted to ask Deta a number of questions. Heidi was still standing on the same spot.","There was a strained silence, while Miss Rottenmeier grasped the situation. ‘Really, Detie,’ she said at last, ‘I don’t know what you were thinking about to bring that child here. She won’t do at all.’ But Detie was not going to give in easily, and replied with spirit, ‘ If you please, I thought she would be just what you were looking for, Ma’am. You told me you wanted an unusual sort of child, and there’s nothing unusual about the older ones. They are all alike. But Heidi is different. I must go now, if you’ll allow me, because my mistress will be expecting me, but I’ll leave her here and come back in a few days to see how she’s getting on.’ With that, Detie dropped a little curtsey, and ran out of the room and downstairs as fast as she could. A moment later Miss Rottenmeier went after her, for there were many things to be discussed if the child was to stay, and apparently Detie was determined to leave her there. All this time Heidi had not moved, not even when Detie left her.","""Young woman,"" said the lady to Dete, ""this is not at all the sort of companion we want. How could you think of bringing me a child like this?"" But Dete was not to be put down so easily, and answered warmly, ""If you will allow me, the child is exactly what I thought you required; she is unlike all other children, and I thought this child seemed as if made for the place. But I must go now, for my mistress will be waiting for me; if you will permit I will come again soon and see how she is getting on."" And with a bow Dete quickly left the room and ran downstairs. Miss Rottermeyer stood for a moment taken aback and then ran after Dete. But she had disappeared out the front door."
"Der Tag der Abreise war gekommen, es war für Klara und Heidi ein trauriger Tag; aber die Großmama wusste es so einzurichten, dass sie gar nicht zum Bewusstsein kamen, dass es eigentlich ein trauriger Tag sei, sondern es war eher wie ein Festtag, bis die gute Großmama im Wagen davonfuhr. Da trat eine Leere und Stille im Hause ein, als wäre alles vorüber, und solange noch der Tag währte, saßen Klara und Heidi wie verloren da und wussten gar nicht, wie es nun weiter kommen sollte.","The day of departure had come, it was a sad day for Klara and Heidi; but grandmama managed to arrange it in such a way that they didn't even realize that it was actually a sad day, but it was more like a holiday until good grandmama drove away in the carriage. There was an emptiness and stillness in the house, as if everything were over, and as long as the day lasted Klara and Heidi sat there as if lost and didn't know at all what was to happen next.","The day of departure had come, but Mrs. Sesemann arranged everything in such a way that the children hardly realized she was actually going. Still everything was empty and quiet when she had gone, and the children hardly knew how to pass their time.","The day of Grandmamma’s departure was a sad one for Clara and Heidi, but she managed to keep them happy right up to the moment when she drove off in the carriage. It was only when the sounds of the wheels died away, and the house was so quiet and empty, that the children felt quite forlorn and did not know what to do with themselves.","The day came for grandmother's departure—a sad one for Clara and Heidi. But the grandmother was determined to make it as much like a holiday as possible and not to let them mope, and she kept them so lively and amused that they had no time to think about their sorrow at her going until she really drove away. Then the house seemed so silent and empty that Heidi and Clara did not know what to do with themselves, and sat during the remainder of the day like two lost children."

"Das war eine große Erleichterung für Heidi zu wissen, dass man doch die Fenster öffnen und hinausschauen könne, denn noch war es ganz unter dem Druck des Gefangenseins von seinem Zimmer her. Klara fing nun an, Heidi zu fragen, wie es bei ihm zu Hause sei, und Heidi erzählte mit Freuden von der Alm und den Geißen und der Weide und allem, was ihm lieb war.","It was a great relief for Heidi to know that one could open the window and look out, because she was still under the pressure of being trapped in her room. Klara now began to ask Heidi how things were at home, and Heidi happily told them about the pasture and the goats and the pasture and everything that was dear to him.","Heidi was relieved. The poor child had felt like a prisoner in her room. Clara now asked Heidi what her home had been like, and Heidi told her gladly about her life in the hut.",Heidi was relieved to hear that. Then Clara began to ask about her life at home and Heidi was soon chattering away merrily about the mountains and the goats and all the other things she loved so well.,"It was a great relief to Heidi to know that the windows could be opened and that one could look out. Clara now began to ask her questions about her home, and Heidi was delighted to tell her all about the mountain and the goats, and the flowery meadows."
"Am Nachmittag musste Klara immer eine Zeit lang ruhen und Heidi hatte alsdann seine Beschäftigung selbst zu wählen; so hatte Fräulein Rottenmeier ihm am Morgen erklärt. Als nun nach Tisch Klara sich in ihrem Sessel zur Ruhe gelegt hatte, ging Fräulein Rottenmeier nach ihrem Zimmer, und Heidi sah, dass nun die Zeit da war, da es seine Beschäftigung selbst wählen konnte. Das war dem Heidi sehr erwünscht, denn es hatte schon immer im Sinn, etwas zu unternehmen; es musste aber Hilfe dazu haben und stellte sich darum vor das Esszimmer mitten auf den Korridor, damit die Persönlichkeit, die es zu beraten gedachte, ihm nicht entgehen könne. Richtig, nach kurzer Zeit kam Sebastian die Treppe herauf mit dem großen Teebrett auf den Armen, denn er brachte das Silberzeug aus der Küche herauf, um es im Schrank des Esszimmers zu verwahren. Als er auf der letzten Stufe der Treppe angekommen war, trat Heidi vor ihn hin und sagte mit großer Deutlichkeit: ""Sie oder Er!""","In the afternoon Klara always had to rest for a while and Heidi then had to choose her own occupation; that's what Fraulein Rottenmeier had explained to him that morning. When Klara had settled down in her armchair after the meal, Fraulein Rottenmeier went to her room, and Heidi saw that the time had come when she could choose her own occupation. Heidi wanted that very much, because she had always had in mind to do something; but she had to have help and therefore stood in front of the dining room in the middle of the corridor, so that the person whom she intended to advise could not escape from her. Right, after a short time Sebastian came up the stairs with the big tea tray in his arms, for he was bringing the silverware up from the kitchen to keep in the cupboard in the dining room. When he had reached the last step of the stairs, Heidi stepped up to him and said with great clarity: ""You or he!""","In the afternoon, while Clara was resting, Heidi was left to herself. She planted herself in the hall and waited for the butler to come up-stairs with the silver things. When he reached the head of the stairs, she said to him: ""I want to ask you something.""","Clara always had to rest in the afternoons and Miss Rottenmeier told Heidi she could do as she pleased during that time. So after dinner, when the little invalid had settled down to sleep and the housekeeper had gone to her room, Heidi felt the moment had come to carry out something she had been planning. But she needed help, so she waited in the passage outside the dining‐room for Sebastian who presently came upstairs from the kitchen with a big tray of silver to be put away in the dining‐room cupboard. She stepped forward as he reached the last stair and said, ‘You, there,’ for she was uncertain how to address him after what Miss Rottenmeier had told her.","When Clara had been placed on her couch after dinner, and the housekeeper had retired to her room, Heidi waited for Sebastian who was coming up from the kitchen with a tray of silver tea-things, which he had to put away in the dining-room cupboard. As he reached the top stair Heidi went up to him and addressed him in the formal manner she had been ordered to use by Miss Rottermeyer."
"Seit dem Tage, da Heidi hatte heimgehen wollen und Fräulein Rottenmeier es auf der Treppe ausgescholten und ihm gesagt hatte, wie schlecht und undankbar es sich erweise durch sein Fortlaufenwollen und wie gut es sei, dass Herr Sesemann nichts davon wisse, war mit dem Kinde eine Veränderung vorgegangen. Es hatte begriffen, dass es nicht heimgehen könne, wenn es wolle, wie ihm die Base gesagt hatte, sondern dass es in Frankfurt zu bleiben habe, lange, lange, vielleicht für immer. Es hatte auch verstanden, dass Herr Sesemann es sehr undankbar von ihm finden würde, wenn es heimgehen wollte, und es dachte sich aus, dass die Großmama und Klara auch so denken würden. So durfte es keinem Menschen sagen, dass es heimgehen möchte, denn dass die Großmama, die so freundlich mit ihm war, auch böse würde, wie Fräulein Rottenmeier geworden war, das wollte Heidi nicht verursachen. Aber in seinem Herzen wurde die Last, die darinnen lag, immer schwerer; es konnte nicht mehr essen, und jeden Tag wurde es ein wenig bleicher. Am Abend konnte es oft lange, lange nicht einschlafen, denn sobald es allein war und alles still ringsumher, kam ihm alles so lebendig vor die Augen, die Alm und der Sonnenschein darauf und die Blumen; und schlief es endlich doch ein, so sah es im Traum die roten Felsenspitzen am Falknis und das feurige Schneefeld an der Schesaplana, und erwachte dann Heidi am Morgen und wollte voller Freude hinausspringen aus der Hütte--da war es auf einmal in seinem großen Bett in Frankfurt, so weit, weit weg, und konnte nicht mehr heim. Dann drückte Heidi oft seinen Kopf in das Kissen und weinte lang, ganz leise, dass niemand es höre.","From the day Heidi wanted to go home and Fraulein Rottenmeier scolded her on the stairs and told him how bad and ungrateful she was for wanting to run away and how good it was that Herr Sesemann knew nothing about it, she had been at one with the child change occurred. She had understood that she couldn't go home if she wanted to, as the aunt had told her, but that she had to stay in Frankfurt for a long, long time, maybe forever. She also understood that Mr. Sesemann would think it very ungrateful of him if she wanted to go home, and she figured out that Grandma and Klara would think the same way. So she wasn't allowed to tell anyone that she wanted to go home, because Heidi didn't want to cause Grandma, who was so friendly to her, to become angry, like Fraulein Rottenmeier had become. But in his heart the burden that lay within grew ever heavier; she could no longer eat, and every day she grew a little paler. In the evening he often couldn't sleep for a long, long time, because as soon as he was alone and everything was quiet around him, everything came so vividly to his eyes, the pasture and the sunshine on it and the flowers; and when she finally fell asleep, she dreamed of seeing the red rocky peaks on the Falknis and the fiery snow field on the Schesaplana, and then Heidi woke up in the morning and wanted to jump out of the hut full of joy--there she was all of a sudden in her big bed in Frankfurt, so far, far away, and couldn't go home. Then Heidi often pressed her head into the pillow and cried for a long time, very softly, so that no one could hear.","Since the day of Heidi's attempted flight a great change had come over the child. She had realized that it would hurt her kind friends if she tried to go home again. She knew now that she could not leave, as her Aunt Deta had promised, for they all, especially Clara and her father and the old lady, would think her ungrateful. But the burden grew heavier in her heart and she lost her appetite, and got paler and paler. She could not get to sleep at night from longing to see the mountains with the flowers and the sunshine, and only in her dreams she would be happy. When she woke up in the morning, she always found herself on her high white bed, far away from home. Burying her head in her pillow, she would often weep a long, long time.","A change had come over Heidi since the day she had tried to go home and Miss Rottenmeier had given her such a scolding. She now understood that, in spite of what Detie had told her, she could not go away when she wanted to, and that she would have to stay in Frankfurt for a long time, perhaps for ever. She believed that Mr Sesemann would think her very ungrateful if she said she wanted to go away, and probably Grandmamma and Clara would think the same, if they knew. So she dared not tell anyone how she felt, but went about mournfully, with a heavy heart. She had begun to lose her appetite and grew quite pale. When she was alone in her quiet room at night, she often lay awake for hours, thinking of home and the mountains, and when she fell asleep at last, it was to dream of them so vividly that she woke in the morning expecting to run joyfully down the ladder from the loft – and found herself, after all, still in the big bed in Frankfurt, so far away. The disappointment of that awakening often made her cry miserably, burying her face in her pillow so that no one should hear.","* * * Since the day when Heidi had so longed to go home, and Miss Rottermeyer had met her and scolded her on the steps, and told her how wicked and ungrateful she was to try and run away, a change had come over the child. She at last understood that she could not go home when she wished as Dete had told her, but that she would have to stay on in Frankfurt for a long, long time, perhaps for ever. The weight of trouble on the little heart grew heavier and heavier; she could no longer eat her food, and every day she grew a little paler. She lay awake for long hours at night, for as soon as she was alone and everything was still around her, the picture of the mountain with its sunshine and flowers rose vividly before her eyes; and when at last she fell asleep it was to dream of the rocks and the snow-field turning crimson in the evening light, and waking in the morning she would think herself back at the hut and prepare to run joyfully out into the sun—and then—there was her large bed, and here she was in Frankfurt far, far away from home. And Heidi would often lay her face down on the pillow and weep long and quietly so that no one might hear her."
"""So, so"", sagte die Großmutter ein wenig seufzend, ""ich habe gedacht, es gäbe vielleicht eine Änderung auf die Zeit, wenn du dann zwölf Jahre alt wirst gegen den Hornung hin.""","""Well, well,"" said the grandmother, sighing a little, ""I thought there might be a change when you turn twelve compared to the Hornung.""","""Oh, dear, I was hoping for a change at last. You are nearly twelve years old, my boy.""","‘Oh dear,’ she sighed, ‘I hoped you might have something different to tell me by now.

"Das war ein ganz neuer Gedanke für Heidi, dass es zu jemandem gehen sollte, aber er fasste auf der Stelle Boden bei ihm, und gleich am folgenden Morgen war sein Erstes, dass es erklärte: ""Großvater, jetzt muss ich gewiss zu der Großmutter hinunter, sie erwartet mich.""","It was a whole new thought for Heidi that it should go to someone, but it grabbed hold of him immediately, and the very next morning his first thing was to explain: ""Grandfather, now I must go down to grandmother's , she's expecting me.""","By the way, Heidi, grandmother asked me to tell you that she would love to see you.""","Heidi was delighted at the idea of going to visit someone, for that would be something quite new, so the first thing she said next morning was ‘Grandfather, I must go and see Peter’s Grannie today.

"Das wusste dieser nun ganz genau und konnte es umso besser in seinem Kopf behalten, da er daneben wenig darin aufzubewahren hatte. Er fing also an und nannte ohne Anstoß eine nach der anderen, immer je mit dem Finger die betreffende bezeichnend. Heidi hörte mit gespannter Aufmerksamkeit der Unterweisung zu, und es währte gar nicht lange, so konnte es sie alle voneinander unterscheiden und jede bei ihrem Namen nennen, denn es hatte eine jede ihre Besonderheiten, die einem gleich im Sinne bleiben mussten; man musste nur allen genau zusehen, und das tat Heidi. Da war der große Türk mit den starken Hörnern, der wollte mit diesen immer gegen alle anderen stoßen, und die meisten liefen davon, wenn er kam, und wollten nichts von dem groben Kameraden wissen. Nur der kecke Distelfink, das schlanke, behände Geißchen, wich ihm nicht aus, sondern rannte von sich aus manchmal drei-, viermal hintereinander so rasch und tüchtig gegen ihn an, dass der große Türk öfters ganz erstaunt dastand und nicht mehr angriff, denn der Distelfink stand ganz kriegslustig vor ihm und hatte scharfe Hörnchen. Da war das kleine, weiße Schneehöppli, das immer so eindringlich und flehentlich meckerte, dass Heidi schon mehrmals zu ihm hingelaufen war und es tröstend beim Kopf genommen hatte. Auch jetzt sprang das Kind wieder hin, denn die junge, jammernde Stimme hatte eben wieder flehentlich gerufen. Heidi legte seinen Arm um den Hals des Geißleins und fragte ganz teilnehmend: ""Was hast du, Schneehöppli? Warum rufst du so um Hilfe?"" Das Geißlein schmiegte sich nahe und vertrauensvoll an Heidi an und war jetzt ganz still. Peter rief von seinem Sitz aus, mit einigen Unterbrechungen, denn er hatte immer noch zu beißen und zu schlucken: ""Es tut so, weil die Alte nicht mehr mitkommt, sie haben sie verkauft nach Maienfeld vorgestern, nun kommt sie nicht mehr auf die Alm.""","He now knew that very well and was able to keep it all the better in his head, since he had little else to store in it. So he began, naming them one after the other, always pointing out the one in question with his finger. Heidi listened to the instruction with rapt attention, and it wasn't long before she was able to tell them all apart and call each one by its name, for each one had its own peculiarities that had to remain the same in one's mind; you just had to watch everyone closely, and Heidi did that. There was the big Turk with the strong horns, he always wanted to bump against everyone else with them, and most of them ran away when he came and didn't want to have anything to do with the rough comrade. Only the bold goldfinch, the slender, nimble little goat, did not avoid him, but ran against him sometimes three or four times in a row so quickly and vigorously that the big Turk often stood there in amazement and stopped attacking because he Goldfinch stood in front of him all warlike and had sharp squirrels. There was the little, white Schneehöppli, who always complained so insistently and pleadingly that Heidi had run over to it several times and comforted her by the head. The child jumped up again now, for the young, wailing voice had just called out imploringly again. Heidi put his arm around the little kid's neck and asked sympathetically: ""What's the matter, Schneehöppli? Why are you calling for help like that?"" The little kid snuggled up close and trustingly to Heidi and was now very still. Peter called out from his seat, with a few interruptions, because he still had to bite and swallow: ""It's like this because the old woman can't come with us anymore, they sold her to Maienfeld the day before yesterday, now she doesn't come to the alp anymore .""","The boy could tell them all to her, for their names were about the only thing he had to carry in his head. She soon knew them, too, for she had listened attentively. One of them was the Big Turk, who tried to stick his big horns into all the others. Most of the goats ran away from their rough comrade. The bold Thistlefinch alone was not afraid, and running his horns three or four times into the other, so astonished the Turk with his great daring that he stood still and gave up fighting, for the Thistlefinch had sharp horns and met him in the most warlike attitude. A small, white goat, called Snowhopper, kept up bleating in the most piteous way, which induced Heidi to console it several times. Heidi at last went to the little thing again, and throwing her arms around its head, she asked, ""What is the matter with you, Snowhopper? Why do you always cry for help? "" The little goat pressed close to Heidi's side and became perfectly quiet. Peter was still eating, but between the swallows he called to Heidi: "" She is so unhappy, because the old goat has left us. She was sold to somebody in Mayenfeld two days ago.""","Peter did not know a great deal, but this was a question he could answer without difficulty. He told her all the names, pointing to each animal in turn. She listened attentively and soon knew one from the other. Each had little tricks by which it could easily be recognized by anyone looking at them closely, as she was doing. Big Turk had strong horns, and was always trying to butt the others, so they kept out of his way as much as possible. The only one to answer him back was a frisky little kid called Finch, with sharp little horns, and Turk was generally too astonished at such impudence to make a fight of it. Heidi was particularly attracted to a little white goat called Snowflake, which was bleating most pitifully. She had tried earlier to comfort it. Now she ran up to it again, put her arm round its neck, and asked fondly, ‘What’s the matter, Snowflake? What are you crying for?’ At that, the goat nestled against her and stopped bleating. Peter had not yet finished his meal, but he called out between mouthfuls, ‘She’s crying because her mother doesn’t come up here any more. She’s been sold to someone in Mayenfeld.’","Peter knew these by heart, so he began, telling Heidi the name of each goat in turn as he pointed it out to her. She listened with great attention, and it was not long before she could herself distinguish the goats from one another and could call each by name, for every goat had its own peculiarities which could not easily be mistaken. There was the great Turk with his big horns, who was always wanting to butt the others, so that most of them ran away when they saw him coming and would have nothing to do with their rough companion. Only Greenfinch, the slender, nimble, little goat, was brave enough to face him, and would make a rush at him, three or four times in succession. Then there was little White Snowflake, who bleated in such a plaintive and beseeching manner that Heidi already had several times run to it and taken its head in her hands to comfort it. Just at this moment the pleading young cry was heard again, and Heidi jumped up running and, putting her arms around the little creature's neck, asked in a sympathetic voice, ""What is it, little Snowflake? Why do you call like that as if in trouble? "" The goat pressed closer to Heidi in a confiding way and left off bleating. Peter called out from where he was sitting—for he had not yet got to the end of his bread and cheese—""she cries like that because the old goat is not with her; she was sold at Mayenfeld the day before yesterday, and so will not come up the mountain any more."""
"""Wir sind jetzt gleich oben, du musst dich nur noch ein wenig anstrengen und große Schritte nehmen, dann sind wir in einer Stunde oben"", ermunterte die Gefährtin.","""We're right up there now, you just have to make a little effort and take big steps, then we'll be up there in an hour,"" encouraged the companion.","""We shall be up in an hour, if you take big steps and climb with all your little might!"" Thus the elder girl tried to encourage her small companion.","‘We’ll soon be there. Just keep going, and see what long strides you can take, and we’ll arrive in another hour.’","""We shall soon get to the top now. You must walk bravely on a little longer, and take good, long steps, and in another hour we shall be there,"" said Dete."
"Bei der Geißenpeter-Hütte angekommen, machte der Großvater gleich die Tür auf und trat ein. ""Grüß Gott, Großmutter"", rief er hinein; ""ich denke, wir müssen einmal wieder ans Flicken gehen, bevor der Herbstwind kommt.""","Arriving at the Geißenpeter hut, Grandfather immediately opened the door and entered. ""Hello, grandmother,"" he called in; ""I think we need to get back to patching before the autumn wind comes.""","When they arrived at Peter's hut, the grandfather opened the door and entered. ""How do you do, grandmother,"" he called out. ""I think we must start to mend again, before the fall wind comes.""","When they reached Peter’s cottage, he opened the door and went in. ‘Good day, Grannie,’ he called. ‘I can see I must get busy with some more repairs before the autumn winds begin to blow.’","When they reached Peter's home the grandfather opened the door and walked straight in. "" Good-morning, Grandmother,"" he said, ""I think we shall have to do some more patching up before the autumn winds come."""
"Heidi machte nicht lange; das war ein ganz neuer Ruf vom Großvater, dem musste es schnell folgen. In kurzer Zeit kam es heruntergesprungen in seinem schmucken Frankfurter Röckchen. Aber voller Erstaunen blieb Heidi vor seinem Großvater stehen und schaute ihn an. ""O Großvater, so hab ich dich nie gesehen"", brach es endlich aus, ""und den Rock mit den silbernen Knöpfen hast du noch gar nicht getragen, oh, du bist so schön in deinem schönen Sonntagsrock.""","Heidi didn't last long; that was a completely new call from grandfather, which it had to follow quickly. In a short time it came jumping down in its pretty Frankfurt skirt. But full of astonishment, Heidi stopped in front of his grandfather and looked at him. ""Oh, grandfather, I've never seen you like that,"" it finally broke out, ""and you haven't even worn the coat with the silver buttons yet, oh, you're so beautiful in your beautiful Sunday coat.""","That was a new call, and Heidi obeyed quickly. When the child came downstairs in her smart little frock, she opened her eyes wide. "" Oh, grandfather!"" she exclaimed, ""I have never seen you in your Sunday coat with the silver buttons. Oh, how fine you look!""","She had never heard him suggest such a thing before, and she soon came hurrying down, wearing one of the pretty Frankfurt dresses. At sight of him, she stopped in astonishment. ‘I’ve never seen you dressed like that before, Grandfather,’ she exclaimed. ‘ Silver buttons on your jacket. You do look fine in your Sunday clothes.’","Why, Grandfather!"" she exclaimed, ""I never saw you look like that before! and the coat, with the silver buttons! Oh, you do look nice in your Sunday coat!"""
"""Das ist dann Eure Sache"", warf die Dete zurück, ""ich meine fast, es habe mir auch kein Mensch gesagt, wie ich es mit dem Kleinen anzufangen habe, als es mir auf den Händen lag, ein einziges Jährchen alt, und ich schon für mich und die Mutter genug zu tun hatte. Jetzt muss ich meinem Verdienst nach, und Ihr seid der Nächste am Kind; wenn Ihr's nicht haben könnt, so macht mit ihm, was Ihr wollt, dann habt Ihr's zu verantworten, wenn's verdirbt, und Ihr werdet wohl nicht nötig haben, noch etwas aufzuladen.""","""That's up to you then,"" threw back Dete, ""I almost think no one told me how to start with the little one when it was on my hands, just one year old, and I already had enough to do for me and the mother. Now I have to do what I can to earn my living and you are the closest to the child; if you can't have it, do what you want with it, then you're responsible for it if it spoils, and you probably won't need to load anything else.""","""You'll have to look out for that!"" Deta retorted. ""When the little baby was left in my hands a few years ago, I had to find out how to care for the little innocent myself and nobody told me anything. I already had mother on my hands and there was plenty for me to do. You can't blame me if I want to earn some money now. If you can't keep the child, you can do with her whatever you please. If she comes to harm you are responsible and I am sure you do not want to burden your conscience any further.""","‘That’s your affair,’ retorted Detie. ‘Nobody told me how to set about it when she was left on my hands, a baby barely a year old. Goodness knows I had enough to do already, looking after Mother and myself. But now I’ve got to go away to a job. You’re the child’s nearest relative. If you can’t have her here, do what you like with her.","""That's your affair,"" retorted Dete. ""If you cannot arrange to keep her, do with her as you like. You will be answerable for the result if harm happens to her, though you have hardly need to add to the burden already on your conscience."""

"Dete reichte der Begleiterin die Hand und blieb stehen, während diese der kleinen, dunkelbraunen Almhütte zuging, die einige Schritte seitwärts vom Pfad in einer Mulde stand, wo sie vor dem Bergwind ziemlich geschützt war. Die Hütte stand auf der halben Höhe der Alm, vom Dörfli aus gerechnet, und dass sie in einer kleinen Vertiefung des Berges stand, war gut, denn sie sah so baufällig und verfallen aus, dass es auch so noch ein gefährliches Darinwohnen sein musste, wenn der Föhnwind so mächtig über die Berge strich, dass alles an der Hütte klapperte, Türen und Fenster, und alle die morschen Balken zitterten und krachten. Hätte die Hütte an solchen Tagen oben auf der Alm gestanden, sie wäre unverzüglich ins Tal hinabgeweht worden.","Dete held out her companion's hand and stood still while she walked toward the small, dark-brown alpine hut, which stood a few steps to the side of the path in a hollow where it was fairly sheltered from the mountain wind. The hut was halfway up the Alm, calculated from Dörfli, and it was a good thing that it was in a small depression in the mountain, because it looked so dilapidated and dilapidated that it had to be dangerous to live in even if the foehn wind swept over the mountains so powerfully that everything in the hut rattled, doors and windows, and all the rotten beams trembled and cracked. If the hut had been up on the alp on days like this, it would have been blown down into the valley immediately.","Deta shook hands with her companion and stood still while Barbara approached the tiny, dark-brown mountain hut, which lay in a hollow a few steps away from the path. Situated half-way up the Alm, the cottage was luckily protected from the mighty winds. Had it been exposed to the tempests, it would have been a doubtful habitation in the state of decay it was in. Even as it was, the doors and windows rattled and the old rafters shook when the south wind swept the mountain side. If the hut had stood on the Alm top, the wind would have blown it down the valley without much ado when the storm season came.","Detie stood watching as Barbie went towards a little brown wooden hut sheltering in a small hollow a few yards from the path. It was so dilapidated that it was a good thing that it got some protection from the full force of the mountain gales.

She wore a jacket with a high collar and had a sort of turban on her head, which made her look very imposing. ‘Shouldn’t they be here by now?’ repeated Clara, still more impatiently.","This lady was sitting very upright at a small work-table, busy with her embroidery. She wore a dome-shaped head piece which made her look very solemn and dignified. For many years past, since Clara's mother had died, the housekeeping and the superintendence of the servants had been entrusted to Miss Rottermeyer."

"""Er verdient's"", schnurrte Peter und wollte zuschlagen. Aber Heidi fiel ihm in den Arm und rief ganz entrüstet: ""Du darfst ihm nichts tun, es tut ihm weh, lass ihn los!""","""He deserves it"", purred Peter and wanted to strike. But Heidi fell into his arms and cried out indignantly: ""You mustn't hurt him, it hurts him, let him go!""","""He well deserves it,"" snarled Peter, ready to strike. But Heidi, seizing his arm, shouted, full of indignation: ""You mustn't hurt him! Let him go!""","‘He deserves it,’ Peter replied, raising his arm, but she caught hold of him and exclaimed, ‘No, you’re not to! It will hurt him. Leave him alone!’","""She deserves it,"" growled Peter, and again lifted his stick. Then Heidi flung herself against him and cried indignantly, ""You have no right to touch her, it will hurt her, let her alone!"""
"""Das kann er nicht, er ist der Großvater, er muss etwas tun, ich habe das Kind bis jetzt gehabt, und das kann ich dir schon sagen, Barbel, dass ich einen Platz, wie ich ihn jetzt haben kann, nicht dahinten lasse um des Kindes willen; jetzt soll der Großvater das Seinige tun.""","""He can't do that, he's the grandfather, he has to do something, I've had the child so far and I can tell you that, Barbel, that I won't leave a place like I can have now behind me for the sake of the child; now the grandfather should do his part.""","As he's her grandfather, it is high time he should do something for the child. I have taken care of her until this summer and now a good place has been offered to me. The child shall not hinder me from accepting it, I tell you that!""","‘Why should he? He’s her grandfather and it ’s high time he did something for her. I’ve looked after her up to now, but I don’t mind telling you, I’m not going to turn down a good job like the one I’ve just been offered, because of her. Her grandfather must do his duty.’","""He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather. He must do something for her. I have had the charge of the child till now, and I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going to give up the chance which has just fallen to me of getting a good place, for her sake."""
"Jetzt sprang der Junge auf, er mochte ähnliche Merkmale haben, seine Wege zu finden. Er lief nun in einem Zug drauflos und Heidi hinter ihm drein, und in kurzer Zeit standen sie richtig vor der Haustür mit dem großen Messing-Tierkopf. Heidi zog die Glocke. Bald erschien Sebastian, und wie er Heidi erblickte, rief er drängend: ""Schnell! Schnell!""","Now the boy jumped up, he might have similar characteristics to find his way. He then ran towards it in one go, and Heidi behind him, and in a short time they were right in front of the front door with the big brass animal head. Heidi rang the bell. Sebastian soon appeared, and when he saw Heidi he shouted urgently: ""Quick! Quick!""","She described it as well as she could, till the boy remembered it. Off they started, and soon Heidi found herself pulling the door-bell. When Sebastian arrived he said: ""Hurry up.""","He thought he recognized that, and ran off at once, with Heidi on his heels. Soon they reached the familiar door with the dog’s head knocker. Heidi pulled the bell and almost at once Sebastian answered it. ‘","In a very short time they had reached the door with the large dog's head for a knocker. Heidi rang the bell. Sebastian opened it quickly, and when he saw it was Heidi, ""Make haste! make haste,"" he cried in a hurried voice."
"Aber die Barbel hätte schon lange gern gewusst, wie es sich mit dem Alm-Öhi verhalte, dass er so menschenfeindlich aussehe und da oben ganz allein wohne und die Leute immer so mit halben Worten von ihm redeten, als fürchteten sie sich, gegen ihn zu sein, und wollten doch nicht für ihn sein. Auch wusste die Barbel gar nicht, warum der Alte von allen Leuten im Dörfli der Alm-Öhi genannt wurde, er konnte doch nicht der wirkliche Oheim von den sämtlichen Bewohnern sein; da aber alle ihn so nannten, tat sie es auch und nannte den Alten nie anders als Öhi, was die Aussprache der Gegend für Oheim ist. Die Barbel hatte sich erst vor kurzer Zeit nach dem Dörfli hinauf verheiratet, vorher hatte sie unten im Prättigau gewohnt, und so war sie noch nicht so ganz bekannt mit allen Erlebnissen und besonderen Persönlichkeiten aller Zeiten vom Dörfli und der Umgegend. Die Dete, ihre gute Bekannte, war dagegen vom Dörfli gebürtig und hatte da gelebt mit ihrer Mutter bis vor einem Jahr; da war diese gestorben, und die Dete war nach dem Bade Ragaz hinübergezogen, wo sie im großen Hotel als Zimmermädchen einen guten Verdienst fand. Sie war auch an diesem Morgen mit dem Kinde von Ragaz hergekommen; bis Maienfeld hatte sie auf einem Heuwagen fahren können, auf dem ein Bekannter von ihr heimfuhr und sie und das Kind mitnahm. --Die Barbel wollte also diesmal die gute Gelegenheit, etwas zu vernehmen, nicht unbenutzt vorbeigehen lassen; sie fasste vertraulich die Dete am Arm und sagte: ""Von dir kann man doch vernehmen, was wahr ist und was die Leute darüber hinaus sagen; du weißt, denk ich, die ganze Geschichte. Sag mir jetzt ein wenig, was mit dem Alten ist und ob der immer so gefürchtet und ein solcher Menschenhasser war.""","But Barbel would have liked to know for a long time how things were with Alm-Öhi, that he looked so misanthropic and lived all alone up there and people always talked about him in half words, as if they were afraid to turn against him be, and yet did not want to be for him. Barbel didn't even know why everyone in the village called the old man Alm-Öhi, he couldn't be the real uncle of all the residents; but since everyone called him that, she did the same and never called the old man anything other than Öhi, which is the local pronunciation for uncle. Barbel had only recently married up in Dörfli, before that she had lived down in the Prättigau, so she wasn't quite familiar with all the experiences and special personalities of all times from Dörfli and the surrounding area. Dete, her good friend, on the other hand, was born in the village of Dorfli and had lived there with her mother until a year ago; then she died, and Dete moved over to Bade Ragaz, where she found a good salary as a chambermaid in the big hotel. She had come this morning from Ragaz with the child; she had been able to drive as far as Maienfeld in a hay wagon, in which an acquaintance of hers drove home and took her and the child with him. --So this time Barbel didn't want to let the good opportunity to hear something go by; she confidingly took Dete by the arm and said: ""One can hear from you what is true and what people say about it; you know, I think, the whole story. Now tell me a little what's up with the old man and if he was always so feared and such a misanthrope.""","Barbara had long been anxious to know something about the old uncle and why he lived apart from everybody. Nobody had a good word for him, and when people talked about him, they did not speak openly but as if they were afraid. She could not even explain to herself why he was called the Alm-Uncle. He could not possibly be the uncle of all the people in the village, but since everybody spoke of him so, she did the same. Barbara, who had only lived in the village since her marriage, was glad to get some information from her friend. Deta had been bred there, but since her mother's death had gone away to earn her livelihood. She confidentially seized Deta's arm and said: ""I wish you would tell me the truth about him, Deta; you know it all—people only gossip. Tell me, what has happened to the old man to turn everybody against him so? Did he always hate his fellow-creatures?""","But Barbie did not mean to lose this excellent opportunity of getting to know more about the old man. She came from Prättigau, farther down the valley, and had only lived in Dörfli a short while, just since her marriage, so she still had much to learn about her neighbours. She was very anxious to know why the old man lived up on the mountain like a hermit, and why people were reluctant to talk about him as they did, freely enough, about everyone else. They didn’t approve of him, that much was certain, but they seemed afraid to say anything against him. And then, why was he always called ‘Uncle Alp’? He couldn’t be uncle to everyone in the village, but no one ever called him anything else, even Barbie used that name too. And here was her friend Detie, who was related to him and had lived all her life in Dörfli, until a year ago. Then her mother had died, and she had found a good job in a big hotel at Ragaz. She had come from there that morning with Heidi, with the help of a lift on a hay cart as far as Mayenfeld. Now Barbie took her arm, and said coaxingly, ‘You could at least tell me how much of what they say is true, and how much only gossip. Come on now, do explain why he’s so against everyone, and why everyone is afraid of him.","Suppose it should come to his ears. I should get into no end of trouble about it."" Barbel put her arm through Dete's in a confidential sort of way, and said: ""Now do just tell me what is wrong with the old man."
"""Ob er immer so war, kann ich, denk ich, nicht präzis wissen, ich bin jetzt sechsundzwanzig und er sicher siebzig Jahr alt; so hab ich ihn nicht gesehen, wie er jung war, das wirst du nicht erwarten. Wenn ich aber wüsste, dass es nachher nicht im ganzen Prättigau herumkäme, so könnte ich dir schon allerhand erzählen von ihm; meine Mutter war aus dem Domleschg und er auch.""","""I don't think I can know exactly whether he was always like that, I'm twenty-six now and he's probably seventy years old; I didn't see him like that when he was young, you won't expect that. But if I knew that it didn't get around all over the Prättigau afterwards, I could tell you all sorts of things about him; my mother was from Domleschg and so was he.""","""I cannot tell you whether he always did, and that for a very good reason. He being sixty years old, and I only twenty-six, you can't expect me to give you an account of his early youth. But if you'll promise to keep it to yourself and not set all the people in Prätiggan talking, I can tell you a good deal. My mother and he both came from Domleschg.""","Has he always been like that?’ ‘That I can’t say for certain. I’m only twenty‐six and he must be seventy or more, so I never knew him in his young days. All the same, if I could be sure that you wouldn’t pass it on to everyone in Prättigau , I could tell you plenty about him. He and my mother both came from Domleschg.’","Was he always shunned as he is now, and was he always so cross? I assure you I will hold my tongue if you will tell me."" ""Very well then, I will tell you—but just wait a moment,"" said Dete, looking around for Heidi who had slipped away unnoticed."
"Der Herr Kandidat musste erst seine Freude über Herrn Sesemanns glückliche Rückkehr aussprechen und ihn willkommen heißen, weswegen er ja gekommen war; aber Herr Sesemann drängte ihn, dass er ihm Aufschluss gebe über die fraglichen Punkte. So begann denn der Herr Kandidat: ""Wenn ich mich über das Wesen dieses jungen Mädchens aussprechen soll, Herr Sesemann, so möchte ich vor allem darauf aufmerksam machen, dass, wenn auch auf der einen Seite sich ein Mangel der Entwicklung, welcher durch eine mehr oder weniger vernachlässigte Erziehung, oder besser gesagt, etwas verspäteten Unterricht verursacht und durch die mehr oder weniger, jedoch durchaus nicht in jeder Beziehung zu verurteilende, im Gegenteil ihre guten Seiten unstreitig dartuende Abgeschiedenheit eines längeren Alpenaufenthalts, welcher, wenn er nicht eine gewisse Dauer überschreitet, ja ohne Zweifel seine gute Seite--""","The candidate first had to express his joy at Mr. Sesemann's happy return and welcome him, which is why he had come; but Herr Sesemann urged him to enlighten him on the points in question. This is how the candidate began: ""If I am to express myself about the nature of this young girl, Mr. Sesemann, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, even if there is a lack of development on the one hand, on the other hand there is a more or less neglected upbringing, or rather, somewhat late lessons, and by the seclusion of a longer stay in the Alps, which is more or less, but by no means to be condemned in every respect, on the contrary undeniably shows its good sides, which, if it does not exceed a certain duration , yes no doubt his good side--""","But poor Mr. Sesemann, unfortunately, did not get his answer, and had to listen to very long-winded explanations of the child's character.","The tutor began to explain in his roundabout fashion that he had only come to say how glad he was that Mr Sesemann had returned safely, but the compliments were waved aside. Mr Sesemann wanted a quick answer to his questions. But still Mr Usher began his explanations, as though he was something which had been wound up and had to go on till the works ran down. ‘If I am to express an opinion about the young person,’ he said, ‘I should like first of all to emphasize that, though she may be backward in some respects as a result of a rather neglected – or perhaps I should say late – education, and because of her prolonged sojourn in the mountains, which of course could be beneficial in itself, if not of too long duration . . .’","The tutor started in his usual style. ""If I must give my opinion about this little girl, I should like first to state that, if on one side, there is a lack of development which has been caused by the more or less careless way in which she has been brought up—"""

"""Nun wohl, dies ist doch ein Name, den man sagen kann"", bemerkte Fräulein Rottenmeier. ""Aber, Jungfer Dete, ich muss Ihnen doch sagen, dass mir das Kind für sein Alter sonderbar vorkommt. Ich habe Ihnen mitgeteilt, die Gespielin für Fräulein Klara müsste in ihrem Alter sein, um denselben Unterricht mit ihr zu verfolgen und überhaupt ihre Beschäftigungen zu teilen. Fräulein Klara hat das zwölfte Jahr zurückgelegt; wie alt ist das Kind?""","""Well, that's a name one can say,"" remarked Fraulein Rottenmeier. ""But, Jungfer Dete, I have to tell you that the child seems strange to me for its age. I told you that Miss Klara's playmate would have to be your age in order to follow the same lessons with her and to do her jobs in general share. Fraulein Klara has completed her twelfth year; how old is the child?""","""Oh well, that is better. But Miss Deta, the child seems peculiar for her age. I thought I told you that Miss Clara's companion would have to be twelve years old like her, to be able to share her studies. How old is Adelheid?""","‘Well, at least that is a reasonable name, but the child seems to me very young. I told you we wanted someone of Miss Clara’s own age, so that they could do lessons together and be real companions. Miss Clara is twelve. How old is this child?’","""Well, that's a name that one can pronounce,"" remarked Miss Rottermeyer. ""But I must tell you, Dete, that I am astonished to see so young a child. I told you that I wanted a companion of the same age as the young lady of the house, one who could share her lessons, and all her other occupations. Miss Clara is now over twelve; what age is this child?"""
"""Warum muss es eine Änderung geben, Großmutter?"", fragte Heidi gleich mit Interesse.","""Why does there have to be a change, grandmother?"" Heidi asked with interest.","""Why should there be a change?"" inquired Heidi with greatest interest.","‘What to tell you? What do you mean?’ asked Heidi, all interest.","The old woman gave a little sigh, ""Ah, well,"" she said, ""I hoped you would have something different to tell me by this time, as you are going to be twelve years old this February."" ""What was it you hoped he would have to tell you?"" asked Heidi, interested in all the grandmother said."
"""Ist das nicht besser als Heu?"", fragte er. Heidi zog aus Leibeskräften an dem Sacke hin und her, um ihn auseinander zu legen, aber die kleinen Hände konnten das schwere Zeug nicht bewältigen. Der Großvater half, und wie es nun ausgebreitet auf dem Bette lag, da sah alles sehr gut und haltbar aus, und Heidi stand staunend vor seinem neuen Lager und sagte: ""Das ist eine prächtige Decke und das ganze Bett! Jetzt wollt ich, es wäre schon Nacht, so könnte ich hineinliegen.""","""Isn't that better than hay?"" he asked. Heidi pulled the sack back and forth with all her might to unfold it, but her little hands couldn't handle the heavy stuff. Grandfather helped, and as it lay spread out on the bed, everything looked very good and durable, and Heidi stood in amazement in front of her new bed and said: ""That's a magnificent blanket and the whole bed! Now I want it if it were already night, I could lie in it.""","""Isn't this better than hay?"" he asked. Heidi pulled the sack to and fro with all her might, but she could not unfold it, for it was too heavy for her little arms. The grandfather put the thick cover on the bed while Heidi watched him. After it was all done, she said: ""What a nice bed I have now, and what a splendid cover! I only wish the evening was here, that I might go to sleep in it.""","‘There, isn’t that better than hay?’ he asked, as they put it over the bed. Heidi was delighted with the result. ‘That’s a wonderful blanket, and my whole bed’s lovely. I wish it was bedtime now so that I could get in it.’","""That is a splendid coverlid,"" said Heidi, ""and the bed looks lovely altogether! I wish it was night, so that I might get inside it at once."""
"""Das brauch ich nicht mehr"", erklärte Heidi.","""I don't need that anymore,"" said Heidi.","""I do not want them any more,"" answered Heidi.","‘I shan’t want them any more,’ she declared.","""I shan't want them any more,"" was her prompt answer."
"Und Klara versicherte immer wieder: ""Gewiss, ganz gewiss, noch mehr, sei nur wieder froh!""","And Klara assured her again and again: ""Certainly, definitely, even more, just be happy again!""","When she had heard Clara's promise, she cried: ""Are you really going to give me as many as I had?""",‘Of course I will. Now do cheer up.’,"She could not get over her sobs for a long time; she would never have been able to leave off crying at all if it had not been for Clara's promise that she should have fresh, new rolls to take to grandmother when the time came for her to go home."
"Heidi war ins Zimmer getreten. Fräulein Rottenmeier blickte nicht auf; Klara sagte auch nichts, es war eine etwas unheimliche Stille. Sebastian rückte Heidi den Sessel zurecht. Jetzt, wie es auf seinem Stuhl saß, begann Fräulein Rottenmeier mit strengem Gesicht und einem ganz feierlich-ernsten Ton: ""Adelheid, ich werde nachher mit dir sprechen, jetzt nur so viel: Du hast dich sehr ungezogen, wirklich strafbar benommen, dass du das Haus verlässt, ohne zu fragen, ohne dass jemand ein Wort davon wusste, und herumstreichst bis zum späten Abend; es ist eine völlig beispiellose Aufführung.""","Heidi had entered the room. Fraulein Rottenmeier did not look up; Klara didn't say anything either, there was a somewhat eerie silence. Sebastian adjusted the chair for Heidi. Now that she was sitting on her chair, Fraulein Rottenmeier began with a stern face and a very solemn, serious tone: ""Adelheid, I'll talk to you later, just this much: you behaved very naughtily, really punishably, that you leaves the house without asking, without anyone knowing a word about it, and roaming around late into the evening; it's a totally unprecedented performance.""","Heidi sat down quietly on her chair. Nobody said a word, and there was an uncomfortable silence. At last Miss Rottenmeier began with a severe and solemn voice: ""I shall speak with you later, Adelheid.","She went into the dining‐room where there was an awful silence. Miss Rottenmeier did not look up as Sebastian pushed Heidi’s chair up to the table, and even Clara did not speak. Then, looking very cross and speaking very severely, Miss Rottenmeier said: ‘I will speak to you later, Adelheid. Now I will only say that it was extremely naughty of you to leave the house without asking permission or saying a word to anyone, and then to go roaming about until this late hour.","Heidi walked into the room. The housekeeper did not look up, Clara did not speak; there was an uncomfortable silence. Sebastian pushed her chair up for her, and when she was seated Miss Rottermeyer said sternly: ""Adelaide, you have behaved in a most unmannerly way by running out of the house as you did, without asking permission, without any one knowing a word about it; and then to go wandering about till this hour; I never heard of such behavior before."""
"""Jetzt gehst du ins Wasser und ich in den Stall und hole Milch, und nachher kommen wir hinein zusammen in die Hütte und essen zu Nacht, dann sag ich dir's.""","""Now you're going into the water and I'm going to the stable and fetch milk, and afterwards we'll come into the hut together and eat tonight, then I'll tell you.""","""First go and take a bath, while I go into the shed to get your milk. Afterwards we'll go inside together and I'll tell you all about it during supper-time.""","‘You go and jump in the washtub, while I milk the goats,’ he replied. ‘Then we’ll have supper together indoors and I’ll tell you about the hawk.’","""Go along now and get into your bath while I go and get some milk; when we are together at supper I will tell you all about it."""
"Herr Sesemann trat mit seinem Brief ins Esszimmer ein, wo das Frühstück bereitstand, und rief: ""Wo ist das Kind?""","Herr Sesemann went into the dining room, where breakfast was waiting, with his letter, and called: ""Where's the child?""","Mr. Sesemann called her now. ""","When Mr Sesemann came back to the dining‐room with his letter, breakfast was on the table. ‘Where’s the child?’","When she appeared at the breakfast table, Mr. Sesemann said: ""You are going home today, little one."""
"Die Brigitte ging noch mit Heidi vor die Tür hinaus, und hier sagte sie ein wenig geheimnisvoll zu ihm: ""Den Rock hättest du schon anbehalten können, er hätte dich doch gekannt; aber sonst musst du dich in Acht nehmen; der Peterli sagt, der Alm-Öhi sei jetzt immer bös und rede kein Wort mehr.""","Brigitte went out the door with Heidi, and here she said to him, a little mysteriously: ""You could have kept your coat on, he would have known you after all; but otherwise you have to be careful; Peterli says, he Alm-Öhi is always angry and doesn't speak a word anymore.""","Brigida accompanied the child outside and said mysteriously: ""He would have known you in your frock; you ought to have kept it on. Please be careful, child, for Peter tells us that the uncle never says a word to anyone and always seems so angry.""","Bridget went outside with her. ‘You could have kept it on,’ she said, ‘he’d have known you all right. But you be careful. Peter says Uncle Alp is so bad‐tempered now, and never speaks to him.’","Brigitta went with her to the door, and there said in rather a mysterious voice, ""You must be careful, for Peter tells me that Alm-Uncle is always now in a bad temper and never speaks."""
"Klara suchte immerfort dem Heidi zu erklären, dass es ja nicht die Großmutter auf der Alm sei, sondern eine ganz andere, von der diese Geschichte handle; aber auch, als sie endlich dazu gekommen war, dem aufgeregten Heidi diese Verwechslung klar zu machen, konnte es sich doch nicht beruhigen und weinte immer noch untröstlich weiter, denn der Gedanke war ihm nun im Herzen erwacht, die Großmutter könne ja sterben, während es so weit weg sei, und der Großvater auch noch, und wenn es dann nach einiger Zeit wieder heimkomme, so sei alles still und tot auf der Alm und es stehe ganz allein da und könne niemals mehr die sehen, die ihm lieb waren.","Klara kept trying to explain to Heidi that it wasn't the grandmother on the mountain pasture, but a completely different one that this story was about; but even when she finally got around to explaining this mistake to the excited Heidi, she still couldn't calm down and continued to cry inconsolably, for the thought had now awakened in her heart that her grandmother might die while she was there was so far away, and grandfather too, and when she came home again after a while, everything was quiet and dead on the alp and she was standing there all alone and could never see those dear to her again.","Clara attempted to explain the mistake, but Heidi was too much upset. She pictured to herself how terrible it would be if her dear old grandfather would die too while she was far away. How quiet and empty it would be in the hut, and how lonely she would be!","Clara had great difficulty in persuading her that the story was about quite another grandmother, and even when she began to understand that, she was not comforted for it had made her realize that Peter’s Grannie might really die, and her grandfather too, while she was so far away, and that if she did not go home for a long time, she might arrive to find everything changed and her loved ones gone for ever.","Then the house seemed so silent and empty that Heidi and Clara did not know what to do with themselves, and sat during the remainder of the day like two lost children."
"Der Alte kehrte sich um und schaute durchdringend auf das Kind, dessen schwarze Augen glühten in Erwartung der Dinge, die da drinnen sein konnten. ""Es kann ihm nicht an Verstand fehlen"", sagte er halblaut. ""Warum brauchst du's nicht mehr?"", setzte er laut hinzu.","The old man turned and gazed penetratingly at the child, whose black eyes gleamed in anticipation of the things that might be inside. ""He can't be lacking in sense,"" he said under his breath. ""Why don't you need it anymore?"" he added loudly.","The old man, turning about, threw a penetrating glance at her. The child's black eyes were sparkling in expectation of all the things to come. ""She is not lacking in intelligence,"" he muttered to himself. Aloud he added: ""Why don't you need them any more?""","The old man turned and looked sharply at her, and saw her black eyes shining with anticipation. ‘She’s no fool,’ he muttered to himself, and added aloud, ‘Why’s that?’","The old man turned and looked searchingly at the child, whose dark eyes were sparkling in delighted anticipation of what she was going to see inside. "" She is certainly not wanting in intelligence,"" he murmured to himself. "" And why shall you not want them any more?"" he asked aloud."

Grandfather has told me not to let you fall down the rocks, so we can't go!""","‘Oh, no, we won’t!","""Oh! oh! oh!"" exclaimed Peter, his disapproval of Heidi's suggestion becoming more marked with each ejaculation, ""why, even the goats cannot climb as high as that, besides didn't Uncle say that you were not to fall over the rocks."""
"""Mit Erlaubnis der Dame"", fing die Dete wieder beredt an, ""es war mir eben selber nicht mehr so ganz gegenwärtig, wie alt es sei; es ist wirklich ein wenig jünger, viel trifft es nicht an, ich kann's so ganz genau nicht sagen, es wird so um das zehnte Jahr, oder so noch etwas dazu sein, nehm ich an.""","""With the lady's permission,"" Dete began eloquently again, ""I wasn't quite sure how old it was; it's really a little younger, it doesn't affect much, I can't quite tell say it will be around the tenth year or so, I suppose.""","""I am sorry, but I am afraid she is somewhat younger than I thought. I think she is about ten years old.""","Detie had expected this question and was prepared with an answer. ‘ To tell you the truth, Ma’am,’ she said glibly, ‘I can’t remember just how old she is, but about ten I think.’","""If the lady will allow me,"" began Dete again, in her usual fluent manner, ""I myself had lost count of her exact age; she is certainly a little younger, but not much; I cannot say precisely, but I think she is ten, or thereabouts."""
"Herr Sesemann trat ins Esszimmer ein, wo Fräulein Rottenmeier den Tisch überschaute, der für sein Mittagsmahl gerüstet war.

"Der Großvater sagte auch nichts. Seit vielen Jahren waren ihm zum erstenmal wieder die Augen nass geworden, und er musste mit der Hand darüber fahren. Dann löste er Heidis Arme von seinem Hals, setzte das Kind auf seine Knie und betrachtete es einen Augenblick. ""So, bist du wieder heimgekommen, Heidi"", sagte er dann; ""wie ist das? Besonders hoffärtig siehst du nicht aus, haben sie dich fortgeschickt?""","Grandfather didn't say anything either. For the first time in many years his eyes had gotten wet and he had to run his hand over them. Then he loosened Heidi's arms from his neck, put the child on his knees and looked at her for a moment.

The old man said nothing either, but his eyes were moist, and loosening Heidi's arms at last, he sat her on his knee. When he had looked at her a while, he said: ""So you have come home again, Heidi?

Did they send you away?’","And the old man himself said nothing. For the first time for many years his eyes were wet, and he had to pass his hand across them.

"""Es ist recht, dass du wieder da bist"", sagte der Peter und verzog sein Gesicht auf alle Seiten vor ungeheurem Vergnügen, dann schickte er sich zur Heimfahrt an; aber heute wurde es ihm so schwer wie noch nie mit seinen Geißen, denn als er sie endlich mit Locken und Drohen so weit gebracht hatte, dass sie sich um ihn sammelten, und Heidi, den einen Arm um Schwänlis und den andern um Bärlis Kopf gelegt, davonspazierte, da kehrten mit einem Male alle wieder um und liefen den dreien nach. Heidi musste mit seinen zwei Geißen in den Stall eintreten und die Tür zumachen, sonst wäre der Peter niemals mit seiner Herde fortgekommen. Als das Kind dann in die Hütte zurückkam, da sah es sein Bett schon wieder aufgerichtet, prächtig hoch und duftend, denn das Heu war noch nicht lange hereingeholt, und darüber hatte der Großvater ganz sorgfältig die sauberen Leintücher gebreitet. Heidi legte sich mit großer Lust hinein und schlief so herrlich, wie es ein ganzes Jahr lang nicht geschlafen hatte. Während der Nacht verließ der Großvater wohl zehnmal sein Lager und stieg die Leiter hinauf und lauschte sorgsam, ob Heidi auch schlafe und nicht unruhig werde, und suchte am Loch nach, wo sonst der Mond hereinkam auf Heidis Lager, ob auch das Heu noch fest drinnen sitze, das er hineingestopft hatte, denn von nun an durfte der Mondschein nicht mehr hereinkommen. Aber Heidi schlief in einem Zuge fort und wanderte keinen Schritt herum, denn sein großes, brennendes Verlangen war gestillt worden: Es hatte alle Berge und Felsen wieder im Abendglühen gesehen, es hatte die Tannen rauschen gehört, es war wieder daheim auf der Alm.","""It's good that you're back,"" said Peter, grimacing on all sides with immense pleasure, then he prepared to drive home; but today it was harder for him than ever before with his goats, because when he had finally got them so far with curls and threats that they gathered around him, and Heidi put one arm around Schwänli and the other around Bärli's head , walked away, then all of a sudden they all turned around and ran after the three. Heidi had to go into the stable with her two goats and shut the door, otherwise Peter would never have got out with his flock. When the child came back into the hut, he saw his bed already set up again, magnificently high and fragrant, because the hay hadn't been brought in long enough, and Grandfather had very carefully spread the clean sheets over it. Heidi lay down in it with great pleasure and slept as wonderfully as she had not slept for a whole year. During the night Grandfather left his bed about ten times and climbed up the ladder and listened carefully to see if Heidi was sleeping too and wasn't getting restless, and looked at the hole where the moon used to come in on Heidi's bed to see if the hay was still tight in there sit which he had stuffed in, for from now on the moonlight was not allowed to come in. But Heidi fell asleep in one go and didn't wander a single step, for her great, burning desire had been satisfied: she had seen all the mountains and rocks again in the evening glow, she had heard the fir trees rustle, she was back home on the alpine pasture.","Peter had a hard time with his goats that day, for they would not follow him. Over and over again they came back to Heidi, till she entered the shed with Bärli and Schwänli and shut the door. When Heidi went up to her loft to sleep, she found a fresh, fragrant bed waiting for her; and she slept better that night than she had for many, many months, for her great and burning longing had been satisfied. About ten times that night the grandfather rose from his couch to listen to Heidi's quiet breathing. The window was filled up with hay, for from now on the moon was not allowed to shine on Heidi any more. But Heidi slept quietly, for she had seen the flaming mountains and had heard the fir-trees roar. * * * XIVToC","‘I’m glad you’re back,’ he said, with a wide grin, and prepared to move on, but he found it very difficult to get the goats together again. He called and scolded, but as soon as he had gathered them round him, they all turned to follow Heidi who was taking Daisy and Dusky towards their stall, with an arm thrown round each. She had to go right inside with them and shut the door, before Peter could get the rest of the herd on the move. When she went indoors again she found her grandfather had made her a lovely sweet‐smelling bed, with hay which had not long been gathered in, and had covered it comfortably with clean linen sheets. When she lay down in it a little later, she slept as she had not done all the time she had been away. During the night Uncle Alp went up to the loft at least ten times to make sure she was all right, and to see that the round hole in the wall was still stopped with hay to prevent the moonlight shining on her face. But Heidi did not stir. She slept soundly all night long, satisfied through and through. She was home again. She had seen the sun setting on the mountains. She had heard the wind whistling through the fir trees. 14","""I am glad you are back,"" he said, while his whole face beamed with pleasure, and then he prepared to go on with his goats; but he never had so much trouble with them before, for when at last, by coaxing and threats, he had got them all together, and Heidi had gone off with an arm over either head of her grandfather's two goats the whole flock suddenly turned and ran after her. Heidi had to go inside the stall with her two and shut the door, or Peter would never have got home that night. When she went indoors after this she found her bed already made up for her. The grandfather had carefully spread and tucked in the clean sheets over the fragrant new mown hay. It was with a happy heart that Heidi lay down in it that night, and her sleep was sounder than it had been for a whole year past. The grandfather got up at least ten times during the night and mounted the ladder to see if Heidi was all right and showing no signs of restlessness, and to feel that the hay he had stuffed into the round window was keeping the moon from shining too brightly upon her. But Heidi did not stir; she had no need now to wander about, for the great burning longing of her heart was satisfied; she was at home again on the mountain. * * *"

"""Na, schon wieder was angestellt?"", fragte Sebastian lustig; als er aber Heidi, das sich nicht rührte, recht ansah, klopfte er ihm freundlich auf die Schulter und sagte tröstend: ""Pah! Pah! Das muss sich das Mamsellchen nicht so zu Herzen nehmen, nur lustig, das ist die Hauptsache! Sie hat mir eben jetzt auch fast ein Loch in den Kopf gerannt; aber nur nicht einschüchtern lassen! Na? Immer noch auf demselben Fleck? Wir müssen hinauf, sie hat's befohlen.""","""Well, did you do something again?"" Sebastian asked merrily; but when he looked right at Heidi, who didn't move, he patted her shoulder in a friendly manner and said comfortingly: ""Pah! Pah!

We have to go upstairs, she ordered it.""","Cheerfully he asked: ""What has happened, little one? Do not take it to heart, and cheer up. She nearly made a hole in my head just now, but we must not get discouraged. Oh, no!—Come, up with you; she said so!""","‘Well, what have you done this time?’ asked Sebastian cheerfully. Still she didn’t stir, so he patted her shoulder and added sympathetically, ‘Come now, don’t take it so much to heart. Keep smiling, that’s the best thing to do. She bumped into me so hard just now she nearly knocked my head off. But don’t you worry. Come along. We’ve got to right‐about‐turn and upstairs again.","""What, are you in trouble again?"" said Sebastian in a pleasant voice, as he led Heidi back up the stairs.

"Und der Angestoßene stieß den Zweiten an und so fort, und in kürzester Zeit flüsterte es an allen Ecken: ""Der Alm-Öhi! Der Alm-Öhi!"", und die Frauen mussten fast alle einen Augenblick den Kopf umdrehen, und die meisten fielen ein wenig aus der Melodie, so dass der Vorsänger die größte Mühe hatte, den Gesang schön aufrechtzuerhalten. Aber als dann der Herr Pfarrer anfing zu predigen, ging die Zerstreutheit ganz vorüber, denn es war ein so warmes Loben und Danken in seinen Worten, dass alle Zuhörer davon ergriffen wurden, und es war, als sei ihnen allen eine große Freude widerfahren. Als der Gottesdienst zu Ende war, trat der Alm-Öhi mit dem Kinde an der Hand heraus und schritt dem Pfarrhaus zu, und alle, die mit ihm heraustraten und die schon draußen standen, schauten ihm nach, und die meisten gingen hinter ihm her, um zu sehen, ob er wirklich ins Pfarrhaus eintrete, was er tat. Dann sammelten sie sich in Gruppen zusammen und besprachen in großer Aufregung das Unerhörte, dass der Alm-Öhi in der Kirche erschienen war, und alle schauten mit Spannung nach der Pfarrhaustür, wie der Öhi wohl wieder herauskommen werde, ob in Zorn und Hader oder im Frieden mit dem Herrn Pfarrer, denn man wusste ja gar nicht, was den Alten heruntergebracht hatte und wie es eigentlich gemeint sei. Aber doch war schon bei vielen eine neue Stimmung eingetreten, und einer sagte zum andern: ""Es wird wohl mit dem Alm-Öhi nicht so bös sein, wie man tut; man kann ja nur sehen, wie sorglich er das Kleine an der Hand hält."" Und der andere sagte: ""Das hab ich ja immer gesagt, und zum Pfarrer hinein ginge er auch nicht, wenn er so bodenschlecht wäre, sonst müsste er sich ja fürchten; man übertreibt auch viel."" Und der Bäcker sagte: ""Hab ich das nicht zuallererst gesagt? Seit wann läuft denn ein kleines Kind, das zu essen und zu trinken hat, was es will, und sonst alles Gute, aus alledem weg und heim zu einem Großvater, wenn der bös und wild ist und es sich zu fürchten hat vor ihm?"" Und es kam eine ganz liebevolle Stimmung gegen den Alm-Öhi auf und nahm überhand, denn jetzt nahten sich auch die Frauen herzu, und diese hatten so manches von der Geißenpeterin und der Großmutter gehört, das den Alm-Öhi ganz anders darstellte, als die allgemeine Meinung war, und das ihnen jetzt auf einmal glaublich schien, dass es mehr und mehr so wurde, als warteten sie alle da, um einen alten Freund zu bewillkommnen, der ihnen lange gemangelt hatte.","And the person tossed on pushed the second and so on, and in no time at all whispered: ""Alm-Öhi! Der Alm-Öhi!"", and almost all the women had to turn their heads for a moment, and most of them fell a little out of tune so that the lead singer had the most trouble keeping the vocals up nicely. But when the pastor began to preach, the distraction passed completely, because there was such warm praise and thanks in his words that all those listening were moved and it was as if they had all experienced great joy. When the service was over, Alm-Öhi came out with the child by the hand and walked towards the vicarage, and everyone who came out with him and who were already outside looked after him, and most of them followed him. to see if he really went into the vicarage, which he did. Then they gathered in groups and excitedly discussed the outrageous thing, that Alm-Öhi had appeared in the church, and everyone looked anxiously at the vicarage door to see how Öhi would come out again, whether in anger and strife or in anger Make peace with the pastor, because you didn't know what had brought the old man down and what it actually meant. But a new mood had already set in for many, and one said to the other: ""It probably won't be as bad with Alm-Öhi as one pretends; one can only see how carefully he holds the little one by the hand ."" And the other said: ""I've always said that, and he wouldn't go in to the pastor either if he were so down-to-earth, otherwise he would have to be afraid; one also exaggerates a lot."" And the baker said: ""Isn't that the first thing I said? Since when does a little child, who has something to eat and drink what he wants, and all the best, run away from it all and go home to a grandfather when he's angry and wild and afraid of him?"" And there was a very affectionate mood towards Alm-Öhi and got the upper hand, because now the women also approached, and they had heard a lot from Goatherd Peter and Grandmother, which portrayed Alm-Öhi quite differently than they did was the general opinion, and which now suddenly seemed credible to them, that it was becoming more and more as if they were all waiting there to welcome an old friend they had long missed.","Though they sat down on the last bench behind, the people had noticed their presence and whispered it from ear to ear. When the pastor began to preach, his words were a loud thanksgiving that moved all his hearers. After the service the old man and the child walked to the parsonage. The clergyman had opened the door and received them with friendly words.","The people of Dörfli were already in church and the singing had started as Heidi and Uncle Alp went in and sat down at the back. The hymn was hardly over before people were nudging one another and whispering that Uncle Alp was in church. Women kept turning round to look and so lost the place in their hymn‐books, and the leader of the choir simply could not keep the voices together. But when the pastor began to preach, everyone gave him their attention, for he spoke of praise and thanksgiving, and with such warmth that his listeners were truly moved. At the end of the service the old man took Heidi by the hand again, and they went towards the pastor’s house. The congregation watched them with interest. Several people followed to see whether they would actually go inside and, when they did so, hung around in little groups, asking what it could possibly mean and speculating whether Uncle Alp would come out again angry or friendly. There were those who said, ‘He can’t be as bad as people make out. Did you see how gently he held the child by the hand?’ or ‘I’ve always said they were wrong! He wouldn’t be going to see the pastor at all if he was such a bad lot.’ ‘What did I tell you?’ demanded the baker. ‘Would the child have left that place where she was so well looked after, with plenty to eat and drink, and have come back, of her own accord, to him if he was as hard and bad as people said?’ Gradually they all changed their minds about old Uncle Alp and began to feel quite friendly towards him. Then some women joined in the talk, and they had heard from Bridget and Grannie how Uncle Alp had come down and patched up their cottage for them and stopped the shutters rattling; and in no time, they were looking eagerly at the house door, like old friends waiting to welcome home a traveller who had been long away, and greatly missed.","Alm-Uncle is in church!"" Soon everybody in the church knew of Alm-Uncle's presence, and the women kept on turning round to look and quite lost their place in the singing. At the close of the service Alm-Uncle took Heidi by the hand, and on leaving the church made his way towards the pastor's house; the rest of the congregation looked curiously after him, some even following to see whether he went inside the pastor's house, which he did. Then they collected in groups and talked over this strange event, keeping their eyes on the pastor's door, watching to see whether Alm-Uncle came out looking angry and quarrelsome, or as if the interview had been a peaceful one, for they could not imagine what had brought the old man down, and what it all meant. Some, however, adopted a new tone and expressed their opinion that Alm-Uncle was not so bad after all as they thought, ""for see how carefully he took the little one by the hand."" And others responded and said they had always thought people had exaggerated about him, that if he was so downright bad he would be afraid to go inside the pastor's house."

"Die Großmutter schwieg still, sie wollte des Kindes Freude nicht trüben.

"""Du bleibst hier und der Kram wird hingebracht, wo er hingehört"", sagte sie bestimmt und hielt das Kind zurück. Aber nun warf sich Heidi an Klaras Sessel nieder und fing ganz verzweiflungsvoll zu weinen an, immer lauter und schmerzlicher, und schluchzte ein Mal ums andere in seinem Jammer auf: ""Nun hat die Großmutter keine Brötchen mehr. Sie waren für die Großmutter, nun sind sie alle fort und die Großmutter bekommt keine!"", und Heidi weinte auf, als wollte ihm das Herz zerspringen. Fräulein Rottenmeier lief hinaus.

Heidi threw herself down now on Clara's chair and sobbed as if her heart would break. ""Now I can't bring grandmother any rolls! Oh, they were for grandmother!"" she lamented. ""Heidi, don't cry any more,"" Clara begged. ""Listen! When you go home some day, I am going to give you as many rolls as you had, and more. They will be much softer and better than those stale ones you have kept. Those were not fit to eat, Heidi. Stop now, please, and don't cry any more!""","‘You’ll stay here. That rubbish is going to be thrown away,’ she said firmly. Heidi threw herself down beside Clara’s chair and began to cry bitterly. ‘ Now Grannie won’t get any nice white bread,’ she sobbed. ‘The rolls were all for her and now they’re going to be thrown away.’ She wept as if her heart would break, and Miss Rottenmeier hurried out of the room. Clara was very upset by all the commotion. ‘Heidi, don’t cry so,’ she begged. ‘Listen to me. If you’ll only stop, I promise to get you just as many rolls as you had saved, or even more, to take to Grannie when you go home. And they’ll be soft, fresh ones. Those you’d saved must have got quite hard already. Come on, Heidi, please don’t cry any more.’","""I must keep the hat, and the rolls are for grandmother,"" and she was rushing to stop Tinette when Miss Rottermeyer caught hold of her: ""You will stop here, and all that bread and rubbish shall be taken to the place they belong to,"" she said in a determined tone as she kept her hand on the child to prevent her running forward. Heidi flung herself down on Clara's couch and broke into a wild fit of weeping, sobbing out at intervals, ""Now grandmother's bread is all gone! They were all for grandmother, and now they are taken away, and grandmother won't have one,"" and she wept as if her heart would break. She could not get over her sobs for a long time; she would never have been able to leave off crying at all if it had not been for Clara's promise that she should have fresh, new rolls to take to grandmother when the time came for her to go home."

"Heidi hob eilig sein Bündelchen wieder vom Boden auf, und Dank und Freude leuchteten ihm aus den Augen. Unten am Wagen reichte Herr Sesemann dem Kinde die Hand und sagte ihm mit freundlichen Worten, sie würden seiner gedenken, er und seine Tochter Klara; er wünschte ihm alles Gute auf den Weg, und Heidi dankte recht schön für alle Guttaten, die ihm zuteil geworden waren, und zum Schluss sagte es: ""Und den Herrn Doktor lasse ich tausendmal grüßen und ihm auch vielmals danken."" Denn es hatte sich wohl gemerkt, wie er gestern Abend gesagt hatte: ""Und morgen wird alles gut."" Nun war es so gekommen, und Heidi dachte, er habe dazu geholfen.","Heidi hurriedly picked up his bundle from the floor, and thanks and joy shone in his eyes. At the bottom of the carriage Herr Sesemann gave the child his hand and told him in friendly words that he and his daughter Klara would remember him; He wished him all the best on his way, and Heidi thanked him very nicely for all the good deeds that had been bestowed on him, and at the end she said: ""And I send my regards to the doctor a thousand times and also thank him many times."" Because it had probably noticed how he had said last night: ""And tomorrow everything will be fine."" Now it had happened, and Heidi thought he had helped.","The happy child at parting thanked him for all his goodness. She also sent a message of thanks to the good old doctor, whom she suspected to be the real cause of her going. While Heidi was being lifted into the carriage, Mr. Sesemann assured her that Clara and he would never forget her. Sebastian followed with Heidi's basket and a large bag with provisions.","Heidi took up her precious bundle, her eyes shining with gratitude and happiness. ‘ Goodbye,’ said Mr Sesemann, shaking hands before she got into the carriage. ‘Clara and I will often think of you. I hope you’ll have a good journey.’ ‘Thank you for everything,’ said Heidi, ‘and please thank the doctor too, and give him my love.’ She remembered that the doctor had said that everything would be all right the next day, so she was sure he must have helped to make this come true.","Heidi quickly picked up her bundle, with a look of joy and gratitude. As she stood by the carriage door, Mr. Sesemann gave her his hand and said he hoped she would remember him and Clara. He wished her a happy journey, and Heidi thanked him for all his kindness, and added, ""And please say good-bye to the doctor for me and give him many, many thanks. "" For she had not forgotten that he had said to her the night before, 'It will be all right tomorrow,' and she rightly divined that he had helped to make it so for her.

"Heidi erwachte am frühen Morgen an einem lauten Pfiff, und als es die Augen aufschlug, kam ein goldener Schein durch das runde Loch hereingeflossen auf sein Lager und auf das Heu daneben, dass alles golden leuchtete ringsherum. Heidi schaute erstaunt um sich und wusste durchaus nicht, wo es war. Aber nun hörte es draußen des Großvaters tiefe Stimme, und jetzt kam ihm alles in den Sinn: Woher es gekommen war und dass es nun auf der Alm beim Großvater sei, nicht mehr bei der alten Ursel, die fast nichts mehr hörte und meistens fror, so dass sie immer am Küchenfenster oder am Stubenofen gesessen hatte, wo dann auch Heidi hatte verweilen müssen oder doch ganz in der Nähe, damit die Alte sehen konnte, wo es war, weil sie es nicht hören konnte. Da war es dem Heidi manchmal zu eng drinnen, und es wäre lieber hinausgelaufen. So war es sehr froh, als es in der neuen Behausung erwachte und sich erinnerte, wie viel Neues es gestern gesehen hatte und was es heute wieder alles sehen könnte, vor allem das Schwänli und das Bärli. Heidi sprang eilig aus seinem Bett und hatte in wenig Minuten alles wieder angelegt, was es gestern getragen hatte, denn es war sehr wenig. Nun stieg es die Leiter hinunter und sprang vor die Hütte hinaus. Da stand schon der Geißenpeter mit seiner Schar, und der Großvater brachte eben Schwänli und Bärli aus dem Stall herbei, dass sie sich der Gesellschaft anschlossen. Heidi lief ihm entgegen, um ihm und den Geißen guten Tag zu sagen.","Heidi woke up early in the morning to a loud whistle, and when she opened her eyes, a golden glow flowed through the round hole onto her bed and onto the hay next to it, so that everything around her shone golden. Heidi looked around in astonishment and had absolutely no idea where it was. But now she heard her grandfather's deep voice outside, and now everything came to her mind: where it had come from and that it was now on the alp with grandfather, no longer with old Ursel, who hardly heard anything anymore and was mostly cold, so that she always sat by the kitchen window or by the stove in the living room, where Heidi had to stay too, or at least very close by so that the old woman could see where it was because she couldn't hear it. Sometimes it was too cramped inside for Heidi, and she would have preferred to run outside. So it was very happy when it woke up in its new home and remembered how many new things it had seen yesterday and what it could see again today, especially the swan and the bear. Heidi jumped out of bed in a hurry and in a few minutes had put on everything she had worn yesterday, for it was very little. Now it climbed down the ladder and jumped out in front of the hut. Goat Peter was already there with his flock, and grandfather just brought Swanli and Bärli out of the stable so that they could join the company. Heidi ran to meet him to say hello to him and the goats.","Heidi was awakened early next morning by a loud whistle. Opening her eyes, she saw her little bed and the hay beside her bathed in golden sunlight. For a short while she did not know where she was, but when she heard her grandfather's deep voice outside, she recollected everything. She remembered how she had come up the mountain the day before and left old Ursula, who was always shivering with cold and sat near the stove all day. While Heidi lived with Ursula, she had always been obliged to keep in the house, where the old woman could see her. Being deaf, Ursula was afraid to let Heidi go outdoors, and the child had often fretted in the narrow room and had longed to run outside. She was therefore delighted to find herself in her new home and hardly could wait to see the goats again. Jumping out of bed, she put on her few things and in a short time went down the ladder and ran outside. Peter was already there with his flock, waiting for Schwänli and Bärli, whom the grandfather was just bringing to join the other goats.","Heidi was awakened next morning by a shrill whistle and as she opened her eyes a beam of sunlight came through the hole in the wall, making the hay shine like gold. At first she could not think where she was, then she heard her grandfather’s deep voice outside and remembered joyfully that she had come to live in the mountains. She had been glad to leave old Ursula, who was very deaf and felt the cold so much that she sat all day by the kitchen fire or the living‐room stove. Heidi had had to stay indoors where the old woman could see her, though she often longed to run outside and play. Now she jumped out of bed, full of excitement at all the new experiences awaiting her. She dressed herself as quickly as possible, then climbed down the ladder and hurried outside. Peter was waiting there with his herd and her grandfather was just bringing Daisy and Dusky from their stall. She went to say good morning to them all.","Heidi felt very happy next morning as she woke up in her new home and remembered all the many things that she had seen the day before and which she would see again that day, and above all she thought with delight of the dear goats. She jumped quickly out of bed and a very few minutes sufficed her to put on the clothes which she had taken off the night before, for there were not many of them. Then she climbed down the ladder and ran outside the hut. There stood Peter already with his flock of goats, and the grandfather was just bringing his two out of the shed to join the others. Heidi ran forward to wish good-morning to him and the goats."

"Fräulein Rottenmeier setzte sich neben sie und winkte Heidi, es sollte den Platz ihr gegenüber einnehmen. Sonst kam niemand zu Tische, und es war viel Platz da; die drei saßen auch weit auseinander, so dass Sebastian mit seiner Schüssel zum Anbieten guten Raum fand. Neben Heidis Teller lag ein schönes, weißes Brötchen; das Kind schaute mit erfreuten Blicken darauf. Die Ähnlichkeit, die Heidi entdeckt hatte, musste sein ganzes Vertrauen für den Sebastian erweckt haben, denn es saß mäuschenstill und rührte sich nicht, bis er mit der großen Schüssel zu ihm herantrat und ihm die gebratenen Fischchen hinhielt, dann zeigte es auf das Brötchen und fragte: ""Kann ich das haben?"" Sebastian nickte und warf dabei einen Seitenblick auf Fräulein Rottenmeier, denn es wunderte ihn, was die Frage für einen Eindruck auf sie mache. Augenblicklich ergriff Heidi sein Brötchen und steckte es in die Tasche. Sebastian machte eine Grimasse, denn das Lachen kam ihn an; er wusste aber wohl, dass ihm das nicht erlaubt war. Stumm und unbeweglich blieb er immer noch vor Heidi stehen, denn reden durfte er nicht, und weggehen durfte er wieder nicht, bis man sich bedient hatte. Heidi schaute ihm eine Zeit lang verwundert zu, dann fragte es: ""Soll ich auch von dem essen?"" Sebastian nickte wieder. ""So gib mir"", sagte es und schaute ruhig auf seinen Teller. Sebastians Grimasse wurde sehr bedenklich, und die Schüssel in seinen Händen fing an gefährlich zu zittern.","Fraulein Rottenmeier sat down next to her and motioned to Heidi to take the seat opposite her. Otherwise no one came to the table, and there was plenty of room; the three sat far apart, too, so that Sebastian found good space with his bowl to offer. Next to Heidi's plate lay a beautiful white roll; the child looked at it with delighted looks. The resemblance that Heidi had discovered must have awakened all his confidence in Sebastian, for she sat perfectly still and didn't move until he approached her with the large bowl and held out the fried little fish, then she pointed to the roll and asked, ""Can I have that?"" Sebastian nodded and threw a sideways glance at Fraulein Rottenmeier, because he was surprised at the impression the question made on her. Immediately Heidi grabbed his roll and put it in her pocket. Sebastian grimaced, for the laughter got to him; but he knew well that he was not allowed to do so. He remained silent and immobile in front of Heidi, because he wasn't allowed to talk, and he wasn't allowed to leave until someone had helped himself. Heidi looked at it in amazement for a while, then asked, ""Should I eat some of that too?"" Sebastian nodded again. ""So give me,"" it said, looking calmly at its plate. Sebastian's grimace became very worrying and the bowl in his hands began to tremble dangerously.","Heidi was motioned to sit opposite the lady. In that way they were placed at the enormous table. When Heidi saw a roll on her plate, she turned to Sebastian, and pointing at it, asked, ""Can I have this? "" Heidi had already great confidence in the butler, especially on account of the resemblance she had discovered. The butler nodded, and when he saw Heidi put the bread in her pocket, could hardly keep from laughing. He came to Heidi now with a dish of small baked fishes. For a long time the child did not move; then turning her eyes to the butler, she said: ""Must I eat that?"" Sebastian nodded, but another pause ensued. ""Why don't you give it to me?"" the child quietly asked, looking at her plate. The butler, hardly able to keep his countenance, was told to place the dish on the table and leave the room.","Miss Rottenmeier sat beside her and motioned to Heidi to take the seat opposite. It was a big table just for the three of them and left plenty of room for Sebastian to stand beside each, as he handed the dishes. Beside Heidi’s plate lay a nice white roll, and her eyes lit up at sight of it. She did not take it, however, until Sebastian was offering her the dish of baked fish, then feeling she must be able to trust anyone who looked so like Peter, she said to him, ‘May I have this?’ and pointed to the roll. Sebastian nodded and looked out of the corner of his eye to see how Miss Rottenmeier was taking it. When Heidi took up the roll and put it in her pocket, he hardly knew how to keep his face straight, but it would have been more than his place was worth to show amusement. He was not supposed to speak or to move until she had helped herself from the dish, so he continued to stand silently beside her, waiting. At length she looked up at him and said in a tone of surprise, ‘Am I to have some of that too?’ He nodded again, making a very odd face in his efforts to stifle his laughter. ‘Give me some then,’ said Heidi, looking down at her plate. ‘You can put the dish on the table and come back later,’ said the stern voice of Miss Rottenmeier, and Sebastian made for the door immediately.","Miss Rottermeyer took the seat beside her and made a sign to Heidi to take the one opposite. Beside Heidi's plate lay a nice white roll, and her eyes lighted up with pleasure as she saw it. When Sebastian came up to her side and handed her the dish of fish, she looked at the roll and asked, ""Can I have it?"" Sebastian nodded, and Heidi immediately seized the roll and put it in her pocket. Sebastian still remained standing beside Heidi; it was not his duty to speak, nor to move away until she had helped herself. Heidi looked wonderingly at him for a minute or two, and then said, ""Am I to eat some of that too?"" Sebastian nodded again. "" Give me some then,"" she said, looking calmly at her plate."
"Während oben Klara zum zweiten Mal mit Zeichen der Ungeduld Fräulein Rottenmeier befragte, ob die Zeit noch nicht da sei, da die Erwarteten erscheinen konnten, stand unten vor der Haustür die Dete mit Heidi an der Hand und fragte den Kutscher Johann, der eben vom Wagen gestiegen war, ob sie wohl Fräulein Rottenmeier so spät noch stören dürfe.","While upstairs Klara was asking Fraulein Rottenmeier for the second time, with signs of impatience, whether the time had not yet come when the expected ones could appear, Dete was standing downstairs in front of the door with Heidi by the hand and asked the coachman Johann, who had just got off the carriage had risen, whether she might disturb Fraulein Rottenmeier so late.","While Clara was waiting, Deta had arrived at the front door with Heidi.

"Am folgenden Abend waren große Erwartungen und lebhafte Vorbereitungen im Hause Sesemann sichtbar, man konnte deutlich bemerken, dass die erwartete Dame ein bedeutendes Wort im Hause mitzusprechen hatte und dass jedermann großen Respekt vor ihr empfand. Tinette hatte ein ganz neues, weißes Deckelchen auf den Kopf gesetzt, und Sebastian raffte eine Menge von Schemeln zusammen und stellte sie an alle passenden Stellen hin, damit die Dame gleich einen Schemel unter den Füßen finde, wohin sie sich auch setzen möge. Fräulein Rottenmeier ging zur Musterung der Dinge sehr aufrecht durch die Zimmer, so wie um anzudeuten, dass, wenn auch eine zweite Herrschermacht herannahe, die ihrige dennoch nicht am Erlöschen sei.","The following evening there were great expectations and lively preparations in the Sesemann house. It was clear that the expected lady had an important say in the house and that everyone felt great respect for her. Tinette had put a brand new little white cap on her head, and Sebastian gathered up a lot of stools and put them in all the right places so that the lady could find a stool under her feet wherever she wanted to sit. Fraulein Rottenmeier walked very upright through the room to inspect things, as if to indicate that, even if a second ruling power was approaching, hers was not about to die out.","The following evening great expectation reigned in the house. Tinette had put on a new cap, Sebastian was placing footstools in front of nearly every armchair, and Miss Rottenmeier walked with great dignity about the house, inspecting everything. When the carriage at last drove up, the servants flew downstairs, followed by Miss Rottenmeier in more measured step.","Next day everyone was very busy preparing for the expected guest. It was easy to see that she was an important person in that household and was accustomed to being treated as such. Tinette put on a nice new cap in her honour. Sebastian collected all the footstools he could find and put them in convenient places so that she would find one ready wherever she sat down. Miss Rotten‐meier fussed about the place, inspecting everything, as though determined to show her authority and that she did not mean to be deprived of any of it by the new arrival.","There was much expectation and preparation about the house on the following evening, for Grandmother Sesemann was coming.

The recollection, the excitement of the night and all the restrained sorrow overpowered the child. The tears rushed violently from her eyes and she broke out into loud sobs.","‘Oh no, it’s wonderful.’ Heidi got no further. The memory of home, added to the shock of all she had been through, overcame the ban which had checked her tears, and they suddenly rained down her cheeks and she sobbed bitterly.","""No, no, it was beautiful, beautiful!""

Dete stood still and looked everywhere.

Then she looked around to see that the child was not so close to them as to overhear what might be said; but the little girl was nowhere to be seen. While the two young women had talked at such a rate, they had not noticed her absence; quite a while must have elapsed since the little girl had given up following her companions. Deta, standing still, looked about her everywhere, but no one was on the path, which—except for a few curves—was visible as far down as the village.","‘All right then – but mind you keep your word!’ Detie glanced round to make sure that Heidi was not within earshot, but she was nowhere to be seen. She must have stopped following them some way back, and they had been too busy talking to notice. Detie stood still and looked in all directions.

"Da es noch nicht Weidezeit war, ging der Peter noch zur Schule ins Dörfli hinunter, oder sollte doch dahin gehen; aber er machte hier und da einen Tag Ferien, denn er dachte, es nütze nichts, dahin zu gehen, das Lesen brauche man auch nicht, und ein wenig herumfahren und große Ruten suchen nütze etwas, denn diese könne man brauchen. So kam er eben in der Nähe seiner Hütte von der Seite her mit sichtlichem Erfolg seiner heutigen Bestrebungen, denn er trug ein ungeheures Bündel langer, dicker Haselruten auf der Achsel. Er stand still und starrte die zwei Entgegenkommenden an, bis sie bei ihm ankamen; dann sagte er: ""Wo willst du hin?""","Since it was not yet grazing time, Peter still went down to the school in Dorfli, or should go there after all; but he took a day's vacation here and there, because he thought it was no use going there, one didn't need to read either, and driving around a little and looking for big rods would do some good, because one could use them. So he came from the side near his hut with the visible success of his efforts today, for he carried an enormous bundle of long, thick hazel twigs on his shoulder. He stood still and stared at the two oncoming people until they came up to him; then he said, ""Where are you going?""","On their way they met Peter, who had not gone to school that day.

When he caught sight of Heidi and Deta, he asked them where they were going.","It was still too early in the year for Peter to be taking the goats up to the pasture, so he was at school in Dörfli – or should have been.

He liked much better to wander off and gather wood, which was always needed.

Aber ich gebe nicht nach, das sag ich Euch, und die Leute habe ich alle für mich, es ist kein Einziger unten im Dörfli, der nicht mir hilft und gegen Euch ist, und wenn Ihr's etwa wollt vor Gericht kommen lassen, so besinnt Euch wohl, Öhi; es gibt noch Sachen, die Euch dann könnten aufgewärmt werden, die Ihr nicht gern hörtet, denn wenn man's einmal mit dem Gericht zu tun hat, so wird noch manches aufgespürt, an das keiner mehr denkt.""","But now Dete took off like a rocket and cried: ""Yes, if that's what you mean, then I'll tell you what I mean: The child is now eight years old and can't do anything and doesn't know anything, and You don't want to let it learn anything; you don't want to send it to any school or church, that's what they told me down in Dörfli, and it's my only sister's child; I'm responsible for how it goes with it, and if it does child can attain happiness like Heidi's now, there can only be someone ahead of her who doesn't care about everyone and who doesn't wish anyone anything good.But I won't give in, I tell you that, and I have everyone for me me, there isn't a single one down in Dörfli who doesn't help me and is against you, and if you want to have it brought to court, think well, uh, there are still things that could then be warmed up to you, you didn't like to hear it, because once one has to deal with the court, there will be again Found nothing that no one thinks about anymore.""","Deta, flaming up, replied: ""Do you want to hear what I think? Don't I know how old she is; eight years old and ignorant of everything. They have told me that you refuse to send her to church and to school. She is my only sister's child, and I shall not bear it, for I am responsible. You do not care for her, how else could you be indifferent to such luck. You had better give way or I shall get the people to back me. If I were you, I would not have it brought to court; some things might be warmed up that you would not care to hear about.""","Detie flew up like a rocket at these words. ‘If that’s what you think, let me tell you something more. The child will soon be eight and she doesn’t know a thing and you won’t let her learn. Oh yes, they told me in Dörfli about your not sending her to school or to church. But she’s my sister’s child and I’m still responsible for her welfare. And when the chance of such good fortune has come her way, only a person who doesn’t care what happens to anyone could want to keep her from it. But I shan’t let you, I warn you, and everyone in Dörfli’s on my side. Also I’d advise you to think twice before taking the matter to court. You might find things being remembered which you’d rather forget. There’s no knowing what may come to light in a court of law.’","Dete leaped up from her seat like a rocket and cried, ""If that is all you have to say about it, why, then I will give you a bit of my mind. The child is now eight years old and knows nothing, and you will not let her learn. You will not send her to church or school, as I was told down in Doerfli, and she is my own sister's child. I am responsible for what happens to her, and this is a good opening for her. I have everybody in Doerfli on my side; there is not one person there who will not take my part against you; and I advise you to think well before bringing it into court, if that is your intention; there are certain things which might be brought up against you that you would not care to hear, for when one has to do with lawcourts there is a great deal raked up that had been forgotten."""
Das half. Augenblicklich sprang Heidi in die Höhe und rannte mit seiner Schürze voller Blumen dem Peter zu.,That helped.

"Dann wurde es kalt, und der Peter hauchte in die Hände, wenn er früh am Morgen heraufkam, aber nicht lange; denn auf einmal fiel über Nacht ein tiefer Schnee, und am Morgen war die ganze Alm schneeweiß und kein einziges grünes Blättlein mehr zu sehen ringsum und um. Da kam der Geißenpeter nicht mehr mit seiner Herde, und Heidi schaute ganz verwundert durch das kleine Fenster, denn nun fing es wieder zu schneien an, und die dicken Flocken fielen fort und fort, bis der Schnee so hoch wurde, dass er bis ans Fenster hinaufreichte, und dann noch höher, dass man das Fenster gar nicht mehr aufmachen konnte und man ganz verpackt war in dem Häuschen. Das kam dem Heidi so lustig vor, dass es immer von einem Fenster zum anderen rannte, um zu sehen, wie es denn noch werden wollte und ob der Schnee noch die ganze Hütte zudecken wollte, dass man müsste ein Licht anzünden am hellen Tag. Es kam aber nicht so weit, und am anderen Tag ging der Großvater hinaus--denn nun schneite es nicht mehr--und schaufelte ums ganze Haus herum und warf große, große Schneehaufen aufeinander, dass es war wie hier ein Berg und dort ein Berg und dort ein Berg um die Hütte herum; aber nun waren die Fenster wieder frei und auch die Tür, und das war gut, denn als am Nachmittag Heidi und der Großvater am Feuer saßen, jedes auf seinem Dreifuß--denn der Großvater hatte längst auch einen für das Kind gezimmert--, da polterte auf einmal etwas heran und schlug immerzu gegen die Holzschwelle und machte endlich die Tür auf. Es war der Geißenpeter; er hatte aber nicht aus Unart so gegen die Tür gepoltert, sondern um seinen Schnee von den Schuhen abzuschlagen, die hoch hinauf davon bedeckt waren; eigentlich der ganze Peter war von Schnee bedeckt, denn er hatte sich durch die hohen Schichten so durchkämpfen müssen, dass ganze Massen an ihm hängen geblieben und auf ihm festgefroren waren, denn es war sehr kalt. Aber er hatte nicht nachgegeben, denn er wollte zu Heidi hinauf, er hatte es jetzt acht Tage lang nicht gesehen.","Then it got cold, and Peter would breathe on his hands when he came up early in the morning, but not for long; because all of a sudden deep snow fell overnight, and in the morning the whole alp was snow-white and not a single green leaf could be seen all around. Then Goatherd Peter stopped coming with his herd, and Heidi looked in amazement through the little window, because it started to snow again, and the thick flakes fell on and on, until the snow got so deep that it reached the window reached up, and then even higher, so that you couldn't even open the window and you were completely wrapped up in the little house. This seemed so funny to Heidi that she kept running from one window to the other to see how things were going to turn out and whether the snow was still going to cover the whole hut, so that a light would have to be turned on in broad daylight. But it didn't come to that, and the next day Grandfather went out - because it wasn't snowing anymore - and shoveled all around the house and threw big, big piles of snow on top of each other, so that it was like a mountain here and a mountain there and there a mountain around the hut; but now the windows were free again and the door too, and that was good, because when Heidi and grandfather were sitting by the fire in the afternoon, each on his tripod -- for grandfather had long since made one for the child too -- there suddenly something rumbled up and kept banging against the wooden threshold and finally opened the door. It was Goatherd Peter; but he hadn't banged on the door out of bad manners, but to knock his snow off his shoes, which were covered with it high up; actually the whole of Peter was covered in snow because he had had to fight his way through the high layers in such a way that whole masses got stuck on him and froze on him because it was very cold. But he hadn't given in, because he wanted to go up to Heidi's, he hadn't seen her for eight days now.","At last even Peter could not come any more, for a deep snow had fallen over night. Heidi stood at the window, watching the snow falling down. It kept on snowing till it reached the windows; still it did not stop, and soon the windows could not be opened, and they were all shut in. When it had lasted for several days, Heidi thought that it would soon cover up the cottage. It finally stopped, and the grandfather went out to shovel the snow away from the door and windows, piling it up high here and there. In the afternoon the two were sitting near the fire when noisy steps were heard outside and the door was pushed open. It was Peter, who had come up to see Heidi.","All at once it turned really cold and Peter arrived in the mornings blowing on his hands to warm them. Then one night it started to snow and in the morning everything was white. It snowed until there was not a single green leaf to be seen, and of course Peter didn’t bring the goats up. From the window Heidi watched with delight as the snowflakes fell, faster and faster, and the snow drifted higher and higher till the hut was buried up to the window sills and it was impossible to go out. She hoped it would go on falling until the hut was completely covered, so that they would have to light the lamp during the day, but that did not happen. Next morning her grandfather was able to dig his way out, and shovelled the snow away from the walls, throwing up great piles of it from his spade as he worked. Then in the afternoon he and Heidi sat down by the fire, each on a three‐legged stool, for of course he had long ago made one for her. They were interrupted by a great banging at the door, as though someone was kicking it. Then it was opened, and there stood Peter, knocking the snow off his boots before coming in. He had had to fight his way through high drifts and it was so cold that the snow had frozen on to him, and still clung to his clothes. But he had kept bravely on, determined to get to Heidi after not seeing her for a whole week.","But he soon left off coming, for one night there was a heavy fall of snow and the next morning the whole mountain was covered with it, and not a single little green leaf even was to be seen anywhere upon it. There was no Peter that day, and Heidi stood at the little window looking out in wonderment, for the snow was beginning again, and the thick flakes kept falling till the snow was up to the window, and still they continued to fall, and the snow grew higher, so that at last the window could not be opened, and she and her grandfather were shut up fast within the hut. Heidi thought this was great fun and ran from one window to the other. The next day, the snow having ceased, the grandfather went out and shoveled it away from the house, and threw it into such great heaps that they looked like mountains. Heidi and her grandfather were sitting one afternoon on their three-legged stools before the fire when there came a great thump at the door. It was Peter all white with snow for he had had to fight his way through deep snowdrifts. He had been determined, however, to climb up to the hut, for it was a week now since he had seen Heidi."
"""So ist's gut, das hör ich gern"", sagte der Papa, indem er aufstand. ""Nun musst du aber erlauben, Klärchen, dass ich etwas genieße; heute habe ich noch nichts bekommen. Nachher komm ich wieder zu dir und du sollst sehen, was ich mitgebracht habe!""","""That's good, I like to hear that,"" said Papa, getting up. ""Now you have to allow me to enjoy something, Klarchen; I didn't get anything today. I'll come back to you later and you should see what I brought with me!""","""That's good, I like to hear that,"" said the father rising. ""I must get my dinner now, for I am hungry. I shall come back soon and show you what I have brought home with me.""","‘I’m glad to hear that,’ said her father. ‘ And now, my dear, you must forgive me if I leave you. I haven’t had anything to eat all day. But I’ll come back later on and you shall see all that I’ve brought for you.’","""That's all right, I am glad to hear it,"" said her father, as he rose from his chair. ""But you must excuse me, Clara, for I have had nothing to eat all day. Afterwards I will show you all the things I have brought home with me."""

"""O wie schön, sieh den rosenroten Schnee! Oh, und an den Felsen oben sind viele, viele Rosen! Oh, nun werden sie grau! Oh! Oh! Nun ist alles ausgelöscht! Nun ist alles aus, Peter!"" Und Heidi setzte sich auf den Boden und sah so verstört aus, als ginge wirklich alles zu Ende.","""Oh, how beautiful, look at the rose-red snow! Oh, and on the rocks above there are many, many roses! Oh, now they are turning grey! Oh! Oh! Now it's all gone! Now it's all over, Peter!""

Oh, now they are getting grey. Oh dear! the fire has gone out and it is all over. What a terrible shame!"" said Heidi quite despondently.","‘How pretty the rosy snow looks, and the red rocks. Oh dear,’ she added, after a pause, ‘now the colour’s going and everything’s turning grey. Oh, it’s all over.’ She sat down, looking as upset as if it was indeed the end of everything.","""O how beautiful, look at the crimson snow! And up there on the rocks there are ever so many roses! Oh! now they are turning grey! Oh! oh! now all the color has died away! it's all gone, Peter.

"""Wie? Wie? Das soll doch wohl kein christlicher Name sein? So bist du doch nicht getauft worden. Welchen Namen hast du in der Taufe erhalten?"", fragte Fräulein Rottenmeier weiter.","""How? How? That's not supposed to be a Christian name? That's not how you were baptized. What name did you get in baptism?"" Miss Rottenmeier asked.","""What? Is that a Christian name? What name did you receive in baptism?"" inquired the lady again.","‘That can’t be your proper name, surely? What were you christened?’ ‘I don’t remember,’ said Heidi.","""What? what? that's no Christian name for a child; you were not christened that. What name did they give you when you were baptized?

"""Komm nach!"", rief der Peter wieder. ""Du musst nicht über die Felsen hinunterfallen, der Öhi hat's verboten.""","""Come on!"" Peter called again. ""You don't have to fall over the rocks, Öhi has forbidden it.""","""Follow me now!"" Peter called out. ""The grandfather has told me to look out for you, and you must not fall over the rocks.""","‘Come on,’ called Peter. ‘ Uncle said I wasn’t to let you fall over the ravine.’","Peter had therefore to be on the alert, and his round eyes, which did not move very quickly, had more work than they could well manage, for the goats were as lively as Heidi; they ran in all directions, and Peter had to follow whistling and calling and swinging his stick to get all the runaways together again."
"""Zum Herrn Sesemann in dem großen Haus, wo an der Haustür ein goldener Hundskopf ist mit einem dicken Ring im Maul"", erklärte Heidi.","""To Mr. Sesemann in the big house, where there is a golden dog's head on the front door with a thick ring in its mouth,"" explained Heidi.","""Bring them to Mr. Sesemann's house; there is a golden dog on the door, with a ring in his mouth.""","‘To Mr Sesemann’s house,’ Heidi told him, ‘where there’s a gold dog’s head with a ring in its mouth on the front door.’","""To Mr. Sesemann's, the big house where there is a gold dog's head on the door, with a ring in its mouth,"" explained Heidi."

""Jetzt holen Sie mir's herüber, es kann vorläufig die Bilder in den Büchern ansehen.""","""Well, that's strange, the child doesn't look like one who can't learn ABC,"" said Ms. Sesemann. ""Now bring it over to me, it can look at the pictures in the books for the time being.""","""How strange! The child does not look to me like one who cannot learn the A,B,C,"" said Mrs. Sesemann.

"""So, so, verstehe schon!"", sagte die Großmama und nickte ganz lustig mit dem Kopfe. Dann schaute sie Heidi genau an und nickte von Zeit zu Zeit wieder mit dem Kopf, und Heidi guckte ihr auch ganz ernsthaft in die Augen, denn da kam etwas so Herzliches heraus, dass es dem Heidi ganz wohl machte, und die ganze Großmama gefiel dem Heidi so, dass es sie unverwandt anschauen musste. Sie hatte so schöne weiße Haare, und um den Kopf ging eine schöne Spitzenkrause, und zwei breite Bänder flatterten von der Haube weg und bewegten sich immer irgendwie, so als ob stets ein leichter Wind um die Großmama wehe, was das Heidi ganz besonders anmutete.","""Well, well, I understand!"" said the grandmother and nodded her head very merrily. Then she looked closely at Heidi and nodded her head again from time to time, and Heidi also looked seriously into her eyes, because something so heartfelt came out that made Heidi quite happy, and he liked all of Grandmamma Heidi so that she had to stare at her intently. She had such beautiful white hair and a lovely lace ruff around her head, and two wide ribbons fluttered away from the bonnet and always moved somehow, as if a light wind were always blowing around Grandma, which Heidi liked very much.","To the housekeeper's great mortification, she called the child Heidi, remarking to Miss Rottenmeier: ""If somebody's name is Heidi, I call her so.""","‘Good,’ said Grandmamma, with an understanding nod, patting her cheek. Then she looked closely at her and nodded again, liking what she saw, for the child’s eyes were grave and steady as they looked back, and Heidi saw such a kind expression on the old lady’s face that she loved her at once. Indeed everything about Grandmamma was delightful to Heidi. She had pretty white hair and wore a dainty lace cap, with two broad ribbons which fluttered behind, as though there was always a gentle breeze blowing round her. Heidi thought that specially attractive.","""I understand,"" said the grandmother, with a cheerful little nod of the head. Then she looked more closely at Heidi, and the child looked back at her with steady, serious eyes, for there was something kind and warm-hearted about this newcomer that pleased Heidi, and indeed everything about the grandmother attracted her. She had such beautiful white hair, and two long lace ends hung down from the cap on her head and waved gently about her face every time she moved, as if a soft breeze were blowing round her, which gave Heidi a peculiar feeling of pleasure."
"""Barmherzigkeit, das Kind ist übergeschnappt!"", rief Fräulein Rottenmeier aus und stürzte mit Schrecken die Treppe hinauf, wo sie sehr unsanft gegen den Sebastian rannte, der eben hinunter wollte. ""Holen Sie auf der Stelle das unglückliche Wesen herauf!"", rief sie ihm zu, indem sie sich den Kopf rieb, denn sie war hart angestoßen.","""Mercy, the child has gone mad!"" exclaimed Fraulein Rottenmeier and rushed up the stairs in terror, where she ran very roughly into Sebastian, who was just about to go down. ""Get that unfortunate creature up now!"" she yelled at him, rubbing her head because she had been bumped hard.","""For mercy's sake, the child is crazy!"" exclaimed Miss Rottenmeier, running up the stairs. In her hurry she had bumped into Sebastian, who was just then coming down. ""Bring the unlucky child up!"" she called to him, rubbing her head.","‘Merciful heavens! The child’s out of her mind!’ exclaimed Miss Rottenmeier and ran swiftly upstairs, bumping violently into Sebastian who was going down. ‘ Bring that wretched child up here at once,’ she ordered.","""Heaven have mercy on us, the child is out of her mind!"" cried Miss Rottermeyer, and she turned and went quickly up the steps. "" Go and bring that unhappy little creature in at once,"" she ordered Sebastian. ""What, are you in trouble again?"" said Sebastian in a pleasant voice, as he led Heidi back up the stairs."
"So wurde getan, und wie nun später Heidi auf seinem hohen Stuhl saß vor seinem Milchschüsselchen und der Großvater neben ihm, da kam das Kind gleich wieder mit seiner Frage: ""Warum krächzt der Raubvogel so und schreit immer so herunter, Großvater?""","That was done, and when later Heidi was sitting on her high chair in front of her milk bowl and her grandfather next to her, the child immediately came back with his question: ""Why does the bird of prey squawk like that and keeps screaming down like that, grandfather?""","They did as was proposed, and when Heidi sat on her high chair before her milk, she asked the same question as before.","As soon as Heidi was settled on her new high chair with her grandfather beside her and a mug of milk in front of her, she repeated her question.","Heidi obeyed, and when later she was sitting on her high stool before her milk bowl with her grandfather beside her, she repeated her question, ""Why does the great bird go on croaking and screaming down at us, Grandfather?"""
"Der Herr Pfarrer schwieg und schaute auf Heidi, das an der Tür stand und die neue Erscheinung aufmerksam betrachtete.","The pastor said nothing and looked at Heidi, who was standing at the door and observing the new apparition attentively.","The clergyman here looked at Heidi, who was standing near the door.","He paused and glanced at Heidi who was standing by the door, looking at him with interest.","""I think you know already what it is that has brought me here,"" and as he spoke he looked towards the child who was standing at the door."
"""Du kannst mir das Zeug noch tragen bis zum Öhi hinauf, du gehst ja auch den Weg"", sagte die Base Dete jetzt, indem sie sich anschickte, den steilen Abhang zu erklimmen, der gleich hinter der Hütte des Geißenpeter emporragte. Willig übernahm dieser den Auftrag und folgte der Voranschreitenden auf dem Fuße nach, den linken Arm um sein Bündel geschlungen, in der Rechten die Geißenrute schwingend. Das Heidi und die Geißen hüpften und sprangen fröhlich neben ihm her. So gelangte der Zug nach drei Viertelstunden auf die Almhöhe, wo frei auf dem Vorsprung des Berges die Hütte des alten Öhi stand, allen Winden ausgesetzt, aber auch jedem Sonnenblick zugänglich und mit der vollen Aussicht weit ins Tal hinab. Hinter der Hütte standen drei alte Tannen mit dichten, langen, unbeschnittenen Ästen. Weiter hinten ging es nochmals bergan bis hoch hinauf in die alten, grauen Felsen, erst noch über schöne, kräuterreiche Höhen, dann in steiniges Gestrüpp und endlich zu den kahlen, steilen Felsen hinan.","""You can still carry my stuff up to Öhi, you're going the way, too,"" said Cousin Dete now, as she prepared to climb the steep slope that towered up just behind Goatherd Peter's hut. Willingly he took over the task and followed the one who was walking on foot, his left arm wrapped around his bundle, in his right hand swinging the goat's rod. Heidi and the goats hopped and jumped happily beside him. After three quarters of an hour the train reached the Almhöhe, where old Öhi's hut stood free on the ledge of the mountain, exposed to all winds, but also accessible to every ray of sunshine and with a full view far down into the valley. Behind the hut stood three old firs with thick, long, untrimmed branches. Further back we went uphill again, up high into the old, gray rocks, first over beautiful heights rich in herbs, then into stony undergrowth and finally up to the bare, steep rocks.","""If you are going up to the uncle, as we are, you can carry the pack till we get there,"" said Deta. They still had to climb a steep ascent that lay behind Peter's hut. The boy readily took the things and followed Deta, his left arm holding the bundle and his right swinging the stick. Heidi jumped along gaily by his side with the goats. After three quarters of an hour they reached the height where the hut of the old man stood on a prominent rock, exposed to every wind, but bathed in the full sunlight. From there you could gaze far down into the valley. Behind the hut stood three old fir-trees with great shaggy branches. Further back the old grey rocks rose high and sheer. Above them you could see green and fertile pastures, till at last the stony boulders reached the bare, steep cliffs.","‘Now you carry the things up to Uncle’s for me. You’re going that way I know.’ And Detie began to climb the steep path behind the goatherd’s hut. Peter was quite willing and followed on her heels, holding the bundle under his left arm and swinging the stick he used for the goats in his right hand. It took nearly an hour to reach the high pasture where Uncle Alp’s hut stood on a little plateau. The little house was exposed to every wind that blew, but it also caught all the sunlight and commanded a glorious view right down the valley. Three old fir trees with huge branches stood behind it. Beyond them the ground rose steeply to the top of the mountain. There was rich grazing land immediately above the hut, but then came a mass of tangled under‐growth, leading to bare and rugged peaks.","""You can carry the things up for me as far as Uncle's, as you are going the same way,"" went on Dete, who was preparing to continue her climb up the mountain side, which rose in a steep ascent immediately behind the goatherd's hut. Peter willingly undertook to do this, and followed after her. After a climb of more than three-quarters of an hour they reached the top of the Alm mountain. Uncle's hut stood on a projection of the rock, exposed indeed to the winds, but where every ray of sun could rest upon it, and a full view could be had of the valley beneath. Behind the hut stood three old fir trees, with long, thick, unlopped branches. Beyond these rose a further wall of mountain, the lower heights still overgrown with beautiful grass and plants."
"""Den erkenn ich auch"", sagte der Großvater, ""das ist die Schesaplana; so hat es dir gefallen auf der Weide?""","""I recognize him too,"" said Grandfather, ""that's the Schesaplana; did you like it on the pasture?""","The child told him now about all the happenings of the day, and especially about the wonderful fire.","‘Oh yes,’ she cried, and told him all the wonderful things that had happened during the day.",The grandfather explained to her it was the sun that did it.
"""Das Zimmer der Angekommenen ist in Ordnung zu bringen, Tinette"", sagte die Dame mit schwer errungener Ruhe; ""es liegt alles bereit, nehmen Sie noch den Staub von den Möbeln weg.""","""The newcomer's room has to be put in order, Tinette,"" said the lady, with a calm she had struggled to achieve; ""everything is ready, just take the dust off the furniture.""","She soon got up again to go to the dining-room, criticising the butler and giving orders to the maid.","Everything has been put ready, but it wants dusting.’","Then hurrying out, she called to Tinette to see that the bed-room was prepared for the little girl who had just arrived."
"Nun wanderten die beiden eine lange Straße hin, und auf dem Wege fragte Heidi den Begleiter, was er auf dem Rücken trage, und er erklärte ihm, es sei eine schöne Orgel unter dem Tuch, die mache eine prachtvolle Musik, wenn er daran drehe.","The two of them walked down a long street, and on the way Heidi asked her companion what he was carrying on his back, and he explained to him that there was a beautiful organ under the cloth that made magnificent music when he turned it.","While they were wandering down the street, Heidi found out what a barrel-organ was, for she had never seen one.","What’s that on your back?’ asked Heidi. ‘It’s an organ. When I turn the handle, music comes out.","They started off together along the street, and on the way Heidi asked her companion what he was carrying on his back; it was a hand-organ, he told her, which played beautiful music when he turned the handle."
"Heidi gehorchte und hüpfte nun dem Großvater nach in die Hütte hinein, wo es vor Freude über das Wiedersehen in alle Winkel sprang und die Leiter hinauf--aber da stand es plötzlich still und rief in Betroffenheit von oben herunter: ""Oh, Großvater, ich habe kein Bett mehr!""","Heidi obeyed and now hopped into the hut after her grandfather, where she jumped into all corners and up the ladder for joy at seeing them again -- but then she suddenly stopped and called down from above in dismay: ""Oh, grandfather, me I don't have a bed anymore!""","Heidi obeyed, and danced around the hut in her delight to see all the beloved things again. Running up to the loft, she exclaimed in great disappointment: ""Oh grandfather, my bed is gone.""","Heidi brought it indoors. She looked round eagerly at everything, then climbed up to the loft. ‘Oh, my bed’s gone,’ she cried, very disappointed.","Heidi obeyed and skipped happily after her grandfather into the house; she ran into all the corners, delighted to see everything again, and then went up the ladder— but there she came to a pause and called down in a tone of surprise and distress, "" Oh, Grandfather, my bed's gone."""
"""Was wollt Ihr aus dem Kinde machen?"", fragte jetzt der Herr Pfarrer.","""What do you want to do with the child?"" asked the pastor.","What do you intend to do with the child?""",‘Then what will become of her?’ he asked.,"""How are you going to let her grow up then?"""
"Der Herr Pfarrer setzte sich. ""Ich habe Euch lange nicht gesehen, Nachbar"", sagte er dann.","The pastor sat down. ""I haven't seen you for a long time, neighbor,"" he then said.","Sitting down, the parson said: ""It is long since I have seen you, neighbor.","‘I haven’t seen you for a long time,’ said the pastor, when he had sat down.","The pastor sat down.

Did anybody send you?"" asked the man.",‘You? What for? Did someone send you?’,"""What do you want up there?"" said the old man. "" Has somebody sent you?"""
"""Ja.""","""Yes.""","""Yes.""","‘Yes,’ said Heidi.","""Yes."""
"""O nein, Großvater, zurück kann einer, das weiß ich auch von der Großmama, und dann geht es so wie in der schönen Geschichte in meinem Buch, aber die weißt du nicht; jetzt sind wir aber gleich daheim, und dann wirst du schon erfahren, wie schön die Geschichte ist.""","""Oh no, grandfather, one can go back, I know that from grandma, and then it goes like the beautiful story in my book, but you don't know it; but we'll be home soon, and then you'll be fine learn how beautiful the story is.""","""But grandfather, everybody can come back to Him; grandmama told me that, and besides there is the beautiful story in my book.

"Damit begleitete sie den Herrn Kandidaten zur Tür hinaus und ging rasch nach dem Studierzimmer, um sich selbst der erfreulichen Nachricht zu versichern. Richtig saß hier Heidi neben Klara und las dieser eine Geschichte vor, sichtlich selbst mit dem größten Erstaunen und mit einem wachsenden Eifer in die neue Welt eindringend, die ihm aufgegangen war, nun ihm mit einem Mal aus den schwarzen Buchstaben Menschen und Dinge entgegentraten und Leben gewannen und zu herzbewegenden Geschichten wurden. Noch am selben Abend, als man sich zu Tische setzte, fand Heidi auf seinem Teller das große Buch liegen mit den schönen Bildern, und als es fragend nach der Großmama blickte, sagte diese freundlich nickend: ""Ja, ja, nun gehört es dir.""","With that she escorted the gentleman candidate out of the door, and made haste to the study to assure herself of the good news. Right here Heidi was sitting next to Klara and reading her a story, visibly penetrating the new world that had dawned on him with the greatest astonishment and growing enthusiasm, and now suddenly people and things and life appeared to him out of the black letters won and became heart-rending stories. That same evening, when they sat down at the table, Heidi found the big book with the beautiful pictures lying on her plate, and when she looked questioningly at grandmother, she said, nodding kindly: ""Yes, yes, now it's yours. ""","""Many strange things happen in this world,"" Mrs. Sesemann remarked, while they went over to the study to witness Heidi's new accomplishment. Heidi was sitting close to Clara, reading her a story; she seemed amazed at the strange, new world that had opened up before her. At supper Heidi found the large book with the beautiful pictures on her plate, and looking doubtfully at grandmama, she saw the old lady nod. ""Now it belongs to you, Heidi,"" she said.","She then went with the tutor to the door and, as he went downstairs, hurried to the study to find out for herself about this good news. She found Heidi reading aloud to Clara, and quite excited at the new world which had been opened to her, as the black letters on the page came alive and turned into stories about all kinds of people and things. That evening, at supper, Heidi found the big picture book beside her place. She looked brightly at Grand‐mamma, who nodded and said, ‘Yes, it’s yours now.’","That same evening Heidi found the large book with the pictures, lying on her plate when she took her place at table, and when she looked questioningly at the grandmother, the latter nodded kindly to her and said, ""Yes, it's yours now."""

Da höhnt er hinunter: 'Würdet ihr auseinander gehen und jedes seinen Weg und auf eine Höhe steigen wie ich, so wär's euch wohler!'""

Heidi followed at his heels, watching him with the closest attention, for everything was new and interesting to her.","""She understands what she sees, her eyes are in the right place,"" remarked the grandfather to himself. And so the time passed happily on till evening."
"Noch zum Abendtisch kam Heidi mit den rot verweinten Augen, und als es sein Brötchen erblickte, musste es gleich noch einmal aufschluchzen. Aber es bezwang sich jetzt mit Gewalt, denn es verstand, dass es sich am Tisch ruhig verhalten musste. Sebastian machte heute jedes Mal die merkwürdigsten Gebärden, wenn er in Heidis Nähe kam; er deutete bald auf seinen, bald auf Heidis Kopf, dann nickte er wieder und kniff die Augen zu, so als wollte er sagen: ""Nur getrost! Ich hab's schon gemerkt und besorgt.""","Heidi came to the supper table with her eyes red with tears, and when she saw her roll she had to sob again. But now it was using force, for it understood that it had to be quiet at the table. Today Sebastian made the strangest gestures whenever he came near Heidi; he pointed first to his head, then to Heidi's, then he nodded again and narrowed his eyes as if to say: ""Don't worry! I've already noticed and worried.""","At supper, Heidi's eyes were swollen and it was still hard for her to keep from crying. Sebastian made strange signs to her that she did not understand. What did he mean?","Heidi came to supper that night with red eyes, and when she saw the roll beside her plate, a lump came in her throat. But she managed not to cry for she knew that would not do at table. Sebastian kept making strange signs whenever he came near her, pointing first to his head, then to hers, nodding and winking as he did so, as though to convey to her something very secret, and when she went to bed she found her battered old straw hat under the quilt.","She could not get over her sobs for a long time; she would never have been able to leave off crying at all if it had not been for Clara's promise that she should have fresh, new rolls to take to grandmother when the time came for her to go home. When Heidi got into bed that night she found her old straw hat lying under the counterpane."
"Herr Sesemann war aufgestanden. In größter Aufregung lief er das Zimmer auf und ab; jetzt brach er aus: ""Mondsüchtig! Krank! Heimweh! Abgemagert in meinem Hause! Das alles in meinem Hause! Und niemand sieht zu und weiß etwas davon! Und du, Doktor, du meinst, das Kind, das frisch und gesund in mein Haus gekommen ist, schicke ich elend und abgemagert seinem Großvater zurück? Nein, Doktor, das kannst du nicht verlangen, das tu ich nicht, das werde ich nie tun. Jetzt nimm das Kind in die Hand, mach Kuren mit ihm, mach, was du willst, aber mach es mir heil und gesund, dann will ich es heimschicken, wenn es will; aber erst hilf du!""","Herr Sesemann had stood up. In great excitement he paced up and down the room; Now he broke out: ""Moonstruck! Sick! Homesick! Emaciated in my house! All this in my house! And no one is watching and knows anything about it! And you, Doctor, you mean the child that came fresh and healthy to my house come, do I send him back to his grandfather, miserable and emaciated? No, Doctor, you can't ask for that, I won't do that, I never will. Now take the child in your hands, give him cures, do what you do want, but make it safe and sound for me, then I will send it home if it wants; but first you will help!""","This is my prescription, and she must go tomorrow."" ""What, sick, a sleep-walker, and wasted away in my house! Nobody even suspected it! You think I should send this child back in this condition, when she has come in good health? No, doctor, ask everything but that. Take her in hand and prescribe for her, but let her get well before I send her back.""","Mr Sesemann got to his feet and paced up and down the room, much disturbed. ‘Sleepwalking, homesick, and losing weight – fancy her suffering all this in my house without anyone noticing! She was so rosy and strong when she arrived. Do you think I’m going to send her back to her grandfather looking thin and ill? No, you really mustn’t ask me to do that. Cure her first. Order whatever you like to make her well , then I’ll send her home, if she wants to go.’","Mr. Sesemann had risen and now paced up and down the room in the greatest state of concern. ""What!"" he exclaimed, ""the child a sleep-walker and ill! All this has taken place in my house and no one noticed it! And you mean, doctor, that the child who came here happy and healthy, I am to send back to her grandfather a miserable little skeleton? I can't do it; you cannot dream of my doing such a thing! Take the child in hand, do with her what you will, and make her whole and sound, and then she shall go home; but you must cure her first."""
"""Ich glaube zwar"", bemerkte hier Herr Sesemann, ""dass auch die Schweizerkinder den Erdboden berühren, wenn sie vorwärts kommen wollen; sonst wären ihnen wohl Flügel gewachsen statt der Füße.""","""I believe,"" remarked Mr. Sesemann, ""that the Swiss children touch the ground if they want to get ahead; otherwise they would probably have grown wings instead of feet.""","""I think that even Swiss children are made to touch the earth, otherwise they would have to have wings.""","‘I think even Swiss children must put their feet on the ground if they want to get anywhere,’ remarked Mr Sesemann drily, ‘otherwise they’d have been given wings.’","""Well, I supposed I was getting a well-behaved and nicely brought up little Swiss girl for Clara's companion"
Am Sommerabend die Alm hinan,Up the mountain pasture on a summer evening,XIIIToC UP THE ALP ON A SUMMER EVENING,13,AT HOME AGAIN ON THE MOUNTAIN
"Jetzt begann der Peter mit einem Mal ein so gewaltiges Pfeifen und Rufen anzustimmen, dass Heidi gar nicht wusste, was begegnen sollte; aber die Geißen mussten die Töne verstehen, denn eine nach der anderen kam heruntergesprungen, und nun war die ganze Schar auf der grünen Halde versammelt, die einen fortnagend an den würzigen Halmen, die anderen hin und her rennend und die Dritten ein wenig gegeneinander stoßend mit ihren Hörnern zum Zeitvertreib. Heidi war aufgesprungen und rannte mitten unter den Geißen umher, denn das war ihm ein neuer, unbeschreiblich vergnüglicher Anblick, wie die Tierlein durcheinander sprangen und sich lustig machten, und Heidi sprang von einem zum anderen und machte mit jedem ganz persönliche Bekanntschaft, denn jedes war eine ganz besondere Erscheinung für sich und hatte seine eigenen Manieren. Unterdessen hatte Peter den Sack herbeigeholt und alle vier Stücke, die drin waren, schön auf den Boden hingelegt in ein Viereck, die großen Stücke auf Heidis Seite und die kleinen auf die seinige hin, denn er wusste genau, wie er sie erhalten hatte. Dann nahm er das Schüsselchen und melkte schöne, frische Milch hinein vom Schwänli und stellte das Schüsselchen mitten ins Viereck. Dann rief er Heidi herbei, musste aber länger rufen als nach den Geißen, denn das Kind war so in Eifer und Freude über die mannigfaltigen Sprünge und Erlustigungen seiner neuen Spielkameraden, dass es nichts sah und nichts hörte außer diesen. Aber Peter wusste sich verständlich zu machen, er rief, dass es bis in die Felsen hinaufdröhnte, und nun erschien Heidi und die gedeckte Tafel sah so einladend aus, dass es um sie herumhüpfte vor Wohlgefallen.","Now Peter suddenly began to whistle and shout so loudly that Heidi didn't know what was going to happen; but the goats had to understand the sounds, because one after the other came jumping down, and now the whole crowd was assembled on the green heap, some gnawing away at the spicy stalks, others running back and forth, and the third bumping into each other a little their horns to pass the time. Heidi had jumped up and ran around in the midst of the goats, for it was a new, indescribably amusing sight to him, how the little animals jumped about and made fun of themselves, and Heidi jumped from one to the other and made a very personal acquaintance with each one, for each was different a very special appearance of his own and had his own manners. Meanwhile Peter had fetched the sack and put all four pieces that were in it neatly on the ground in a square, the big pieces on Heidi's side and the small ones on his, for he knew exactly how he had gotten them. Then he took the little bowl and milked nice, fresh milk from the swan and put the little bowl in the middle of the square. Then he called Heidi, but had to call for longer than for the goats, because the child was so excited and happy about the various jumps and amusements of her new playmates that she saw and heard nothing but these. But Peter knew how to make himself understood, he shouted so that it boomed up to the rocks, and now Heidi appeared and the laid table looked so inviting that people jumped around her with delight.","Peter now began to call loudly and to whistle, and soon all the goats were assembled on the green field. Heidi ran into their midst, for she loved to see them leaping and playing about. Peter in the meantime was preparing dinner for Heidi and himself, by putting her large pieces on one side and his own small ones on the other. Then he milked Bärli and put the full bowl in the middle. When he was ready, he called to the little girl. But it took some time before she obeyed his call. SHE HANDED HIM","Even the goats can’t climb as high as that, and don’t forget Uncle told me to look after you,’ he said with marked disapproval. To Heidi’s surprise he then began whistling and shouting, but the goats recognized the familiar sounds and came towards him from all directions, though some lingered to nibble a tasty blade of grass, while others butted one another playfully. Heidi jumped up and ran among them, delighted to see them so obviously enjoying themselves. She spoke to each one, and every one was different and easily distinguishable from the others. Meanwhile Peter opened his bag and spread its contents out in a square on the ground, two large portions for Heidi and two smaller ones for himself. Then he filled the mug with milk from Daisy and placed it in the middle of the square. He called to Heidi, but she was slower to come than the goats had been. She was so busy with her new playmates that she had ears and eyes for nothing else. He went on calling till his voice re‐echoed from the rocks and at last she appeared. When she saw the meal laid out so invitingly, she skipped up and down with pleasure.","Peter now began suddenly whistling and calling in such a loud manner that Heidi could not think what was happening; but the goats evidently understood his voice, for one after the other they came springing down the rocks until they were all assembled on the green plateau. Peter took the little bowl and milked some delicious, fresh milk into it from the white goat. Heidi jumped up and ran in and out among them, for it was new to her to see the goats playing together like this. Meanwhile Peter had taken the wallet out of the hollow and placed the pieces of bread and cheese on the ground in the shape of a square, the larger two on Heidi's side and the smaller on his own, for he knew exactly which were hers and which his. Then he took the little bowl and milked some delicious, fresh milk into it from the white goat, and afterwards set the bowl in the middle of the square."
"""Im Winter muss er in die Schule gehen"", erklärte der Großvater; ""da lernt man lesen und schreiben, und das geht manchmal schwer, da hilft's ein wenig nach, wenn man am Griffel nagt; ist's nicht wahr, General?""","""In the winter he has to go to school,"" explained the grandfather; ""You learn to read and write there, and that's sometimes difficult, so it helps a little if you gnaw on the stylus; isn't that right, General?""","Poor Peter, who was not an easy talker, found himself in great difficulty answering the little girl's inquiries, but at least it gave him leisure to dry his clothes.","‘Yes, in the winter Peter has to go to school and learn to read and write. That’s no easy matter you know, and it sometimes helps a bit to chew a pencil, doesn’t it, General?’","""During the winter he must go to school,"" explained her grandfather, ""and learn how to read and write; it's a bit hard, although useful sometimes afterwards. Am I not right, General?"""
"""Mit Erlaubnis und wenn es die Dame gestattet, so will ich gern reden für das Kind, denn es ist sehr unerfahren"", sagte die Dete, nachdem sie dem Heidi heimlich einen kleinen Stoß gegeben hatte für die unpassende Antwort. ""Es ist aber nicht einfältig und auch nicht schnippisch, davon weiß es gar nichts; es meint alles so, wie es redet. Aber es ist heut zum ersten Mal in einem Herrenhaus und kennt die gute Manier nicht; aber es ist willig und nicht ungelehrig, wenn die Dame wollte gütige Nachsicht haben. Es ist Adelheid getauft worden, wie seine Mutter, meine Schwester selig.""","""With permission and if the lady allows it, I would like to speak for the child, because she is very inexperienced,"" said Dete, after she had secretly nudged Heidi for the inappropriate answer. ""But it is neither simple-minded nor snappy, it knows nothing about that; it means everything as it says it. But today it is the first time in a manor house and it does not know the good manners; but it is willing and not unteachable , if the lady would have kind indulgence. Adelheid was baptized like his mother, my sister blessed.""","""I shall speak for the child, if I may, madam,"" Deta said, after giving Heidi a little blow for her unbecoming answer. ""The child has never been in such a fine house and does not know how to behave. I hope the lady will forgive her manners. She is called Adelheid after her mother, who was my sister.""","‘If you please, Ma’am, I’ll speak for her. She’s not used to strangers,’ Detie replied, giving Heidi a little push as punishment for her unsuitable reply. ‘She’s not halfwitted I can assure you, nor impertinent either, but she doesn’t know any better. She says the first thing that comes into her head. She’s never been in a house like this before and no one’s taught her how to behave. But she’s bright and quick to learn if anyone would take a little trouble with her. So please excuse her, Ma’am. She was christened Adelheid after her mother, my dead sister.’","""If the lady will allow me, I will speak for the child, for she is very unaccustomed to strangers,"" said Dete, who had given Heidi a silent poke for making such an unsuitable answer. ""She is certainly not stupid nor yet saucy, she speaks exactly as she thinks. This is the first time she has ever been in a gentleman's house and she does not know good manners; but she is very willing to learn. She was christened Adelaide, after her mother, my sister, who is now dead."""
"""Was du willst, Kind, was du willst"", und mit gespannter Erwartung saß die Großmutter da und hatte ihr Spinnrad ein wenig von sich geschoben.","""Whatever you want, child, whatever you want,"" and the grandmother sat there with tense anticipation and had pushed her spinning wheel a little away from her.","But Heidi did not listen but jumped gaily about the little room, calling over and over again: ""Now grandmother can have a roll every day.","‘What you like, child,’ Grannie said, pushing her spinning‐wheel to one side and waiting eagerly for her to begin.","""What you like, child, what you like,"" and the grandmother pushed her spinning-wheel aside and sat in eager expectation waiting for Heidi to begin. ""Here is one about the sun, Grandmother, I will read you that."""
"""Ich den Herrn Pfarrer auch nicht"", war die Antwort.","""Neither do I, the pastor,"" was the reply.","Sitting down, the parson said: ""It is long since I have seen you, neighbor.","‘Nor I you,’ was the reply.","""It is a long time since I have seen you, neighbor,"" he said."

"Heidi stand auf und gab ihr die Hand, und die Brigitte konnte sich gar nicht genug verwundern darüber, wie Heidi aussehe, und ging um das Kind herum und sagte: ""Großmutter, wenn du doch nur sehen könntest, was für ein schönes Röcklein das Heidi hat und wie es aussieht; man kennt es fast nicht mehr. Und das Federnhütlein auf dem Tisch gehört dir auch noch? Setz es doch einmal auf, so kann ich sehen, wie du drin aussiehst.""","Heidi got up and shook her hand, and Brigitte couldn't be more amazed at how Heidi looked, and walked around the child and said: ""Grandmother, if only you could see what a beautiful little skirt Heidi is and what it looks like; one hardly knows it anymore. And the little feather hat on the table is yours too? Put it on, so I can see what you look like in it.""","While Heidi was talking, Peter's mother arrived, and exclaimed in her amazement: ""Surely, this is Heidi. But how can that be?""","Fancy you here,’ she said at last, ‘and she’s wearing such a pretty dress, Grannie. She looks so fine I hardly recognized her. And a little hat with a feather – I suppose that is yours too. Put it on and let me see you in it.’","Heidi stood up, and Brigitta could not say enough in her admiration of the child's dress and appearance; she walked round her, exclaiming all the while, ""Grandmother, if you could only see her, and see what a pretty frock she has on; you would hardly know her again. And the hat with the feather in it is yours too, I suppose? Put it on that I may see how you look in it?"""
"Der Türmer stellte Heidi wieder auf den Boden und stieg ihm voran die schmalen Stufen hinab. Wo diese breiter wurden, kam links die Tür, die in des Türmers Stübchen führte, und nebenan ging der Boden bis unter das schräge Dach hin. Dort hinten stand ein großer Korb und davor saß eine dicke graue Katze und knurrte, denn in dem Korb wohnte ihre Familie und sie wollte jeden Vorübergehenden davor warnen, sich in ihre Familienangelegenheiten zu mischen. Heidi stand still und schaute verwundert hinüber, eine so mächtige Katze hatte es noch nie gesehen; in dem alten Turm wohnten aber ganze Herden von Mäusen, so holte sich die Katze ohne Mühe jeden Tag ein halbes Dutzend Mäusebraten. Der Türmer sah Heidis Bewunderung und sagte: ""Komm, sie tut dir nichts, wenn ich dabei bin; du kannst die Jungen ansehen.""","The watchman put Heidi back on the ground and led her down the narrow steps. Where these widened, there was a door on the left that led to the watchman's room, and next door the floor went right up to under the sloping roof. There was a big basket back there and in front of it sat a fat gray cat and growled, because her family lived in the basket and she wanted to warn anyone passing by not to interfere in her family affairs. Heidi stood still and looked over in astonishment, such a mighty cat had never seen it before; Whole herds of mice lived in the old tower, so the cat easily fetched half a dozen roast mice every day. The watchman saw Heidi's admiration and said, ""Come on, she won't hurt you when I'm with you; you can look at the boys.""","On their way they passed an attic, where a large grey cat guarded her new family in a basket. This cat caught half-a-dozen mice every day for herself, for the old tower was full of rats and mice. Heidi gazed at her in surprise, and was delighted when the old man opened the basket.","He set her on the ground and she followed him down. When they came to the landing at the bottom of the narrowest flight of stairs she noticed a door on the left, which led to the keeper’s room. There, in a corner beside it, a fat grey cat sat beside a big basket, and spat as Heidi approached, to warn her that this was the home of her family of kittens and that she would not allow anyone to meddle with them. Heidi stood and stared, for she had never seen such a huge cat before. There were such quantities of mice in the tower that it could catch half a dozen a day without any difficulty, and had grown sleek and fat on them. ‘Come and look at the kittens,’ said the keeper. ‘The mother won’t touch you if I’m with you.’","On the way down they passed the tower-keeper's room. At the far end of this was a large basket, in front of which sat a big grey cat. Heidi went up to the basket and broke out into expressions of delight."
"""Ach, ist auch das möglich! Ist auch so etwas möglich! So hat uns doch der liebe Gott nicht ganz vergessen!"", rief die Großmutter aus. ""Hast du's gehört, Brigitte, was es ist, hörst du's?

Peter opened his round eyes as wide as possible in astonishment, for the two pieces were probably twice as large as the two he had inside for his own midday meal.","The grandfather put into the bag a piece of bread and a slice of cheese, that were easily twice as large as those the boy had in the bag himself.","Peter held out the little bag which contained his meagre lunch, and watched with big eyes as the old man put in a piece of bread and a piece of cheese, both twice as big as his own. ‘Take this mug too, and fill it for her twice at dinner time.","""Open it,"" said the old man, and he put in a large piece of bread and an equally large piece of cheese, which made Peter open his eyes, for each was twice the size of the two portions which he had for his own dinner."
"Ein paar Stunden später, als Heidi längst im tiefen Schlafe lag, stieg der Großvater die kleine Leiter hinauf; er stellte sein Lämpchen neben Heidis Lager hin, so dass das Licht auf das schlafende Kind fiel. Es lag da mit gefalteten Händen, denn zu beten hatte Heidi nicht vergessen. Auf seinem rosigen Gesichtchen lag ein Ausdruck des Friedens und seligen Vertrauens, der zu dem Großvater reden musste, denn lange, lange stand er da und rührte sich nicht und wandte kein Auge von dem schlafenden Kinde ab. Jetzt faltete auch er die Hände, und halblaut sagte er mit gesenktem Haupte: ""Vater, ich habe gesündigt gegen den Himmel und vor dir und bin nicht mehr wert, dein Sohn zu heißen!"" Und ein paar große Tränen rollten dem Alten die Wangen herab.--","A few hours later, when Heidi had long been fast asleep, Grandfather climbed up the little ladder; he placed his lamp next to Heidi's bed so that the light fell on the sleeping child. It lay there with folded hands, because Heidi hadn't forgotten to pray. On his rosy little face lay an expression of peace and blissful trust, which must have spoken to the grandfather, for for a long, long time he stood there and did not move and did not take his eyes off the sleeping child. Now he also folded his hands and said in a low voice with bowed head: ""Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you and I am no longer worthy to be called your son!"" And a few big tears rolled down the old man's cheeks.--","A few hours later, when Heidi was sleeping soundly, the old man climbed up the ladder. Placing a little lamp beside the sleeping child, he watched her a long, long time. Her little hands were folded and her rosy face looked confident and peaceful. The old man now folded his hands and said in a low voice, while big tears rolled down his cheeks: ""Father, I have sinned against Heaven and Thee, and am no more worthy to be Thy son!""","Some hours later, when Heidi was in bed and asleep, the old man climbed up to the loft and put his lamp on the ground so that its light fell on her. She lay with her hands folded, as if she had fallen asleep saying her prayers. There was a peaceful, very trusting expression on her face, which moved him deeply and he stood gazing down at her for a long time. Then he too folded his hands, bowed his head, and, in a low voice, said, ‘Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before Thee and am no longer worthy to be called Thy son,’ and down his wrinkled cheeks rolled two large tears.","A few hours later, as she lay fast asleep in her bed, the grandfather went up the ladder and put his lamp down near her bed so that the light fell on the sleeping child. Her hands were still folded as if she had fallen asleep saying her prayers, an expression of peace and trust lay on the little face, and something in it seemed to appeal to the grandfather, for he stood a long time gazing down at her without speaking. At last he too folded his hands, and with bowed head said in a low voice, ""Father, I have sinned against heaven and before Thee and am not worthy to be called Thy son."" And two large tears rolled down the old man's cheeks."
"Hier wohnte der Geißenpeter, der elfjährige Bube, der jeden Morgen unten im Dörfli die Geißen holte, um sie hoch auf die Alm hinaufzutreiben, um sie da die kurzen kräftigen Kräuter fressen zu lassen bis zum Abend; dann sprang der Peter mit den leichtfüßigen Tierchen wieder herunter, tat, im Dörfli angekommen, einen schrillen Pfiff durch die Finger, und jeder Besitzer holte seine Geiß auf dem Platz. Meistens kamen kleine Buben und Mädchen, denn die friedlichen Geißen waren nicht zu fürchten, und das war denn den ganzen Sommer durch die einzige Zeit am Tage, da der Peter mit seinesgleichen verkehrte; sonst lebte er nur mit den Geißen. Er hatte zwar daheim seine Mutter und die blinde Großmutter; aber da er immer am Morgen sehr früh fortmusste und am Abend vom Dörfli spät heimkam, weil er sich da noch so lange als möglich mit den Kindern unterhalten musste, so verbrachte er daheim nur gerade so viel Zeit, um am Morgen seine Milch und Brot und am Abend ebendasselbe hinunterzuschlucken und dann sich aufs Ohr zu legen und zu schlafen. Sein Vater, der auch schon der Geißenpeter genannt worden war, weil er in früheren Jahren in demselben Berufe gestanden hatte, war vor einigen Jahren beim Holzfällen verunglückt. Seine Mutter, die zwar Brigitte hieß, wurde von jedermann um des Zusammenhangs willen die Geißenpeterin genannt, und die blinde Großmutter kannten weit und breit Alt und Jung nur unter dem Namen Großmutter.","This is where Geißenpeter lived, the eleven-year-old boy who fetched the goats from Dörfli every morning to drive them up to the pasture to let them eat the short, strong herbs until evening; then Peter jumped down again with the light-footed little animals, when he arrived in Dorfli he whistled shrillly through his fingers, and every owner fetched his goat from the square. Mostly little boys and girls came, for the peaceful goats were not to be feared, and that was the only time of day throughout the summer when Peter socialized with his own kind; otherwise he lived only with the goats. True, he had his mother and blind grandmother at home; but since he always had to leave very early in the morning and came home late from Dörfli in the evening because he still had to talk to the children for as long as possible, he only spent just enough time at home to buy his milk and bread and swallowing the same thing in the evening and then lying on your ear and sleeping. His father, who had also been called Peter the Goatherd because he had worked in the same profession in earlier years, had had an accident a few years earlier while felling wood. His mother, who was actually called Brigitte, was called Geißenpeterin by everyone for the sake of context, and the blind grandmother was known far and wide by old and young only under the name Grandmother.","Here lived Peter the goatherd, a boy eleven years old, who daily fetched the goats from the village and drove them up the mountain to the short and luscious grasses of the pastures. Peter raced down in the evening with the light-footed little goats. When he whistled sharply through his fingers, every owner would come and get his or her goat. These owners were mostly small boys and girls and, as the goats were friendly, they did not fear them. That was the only time Peter spent with other children, the rest of the day the animals were his sole companions. At home lived his mother and an old blind grandmother, but he only spent enough time in the hut to swallow his bread and milk for breakfast and the same repast for supper. After that he sought his bed to sleep. He always left early in the morning and at night he came home late, so that he could be with his friends as long as possible. His father had met with an accident some years ago; he also had been called Peter the goatherd. His mother, whose name was Brigida, was called ""Goatherd Peter's wife"" and his blind grandmother was called by young and old from many miles about just ""grandmother.""","This was Peter the goatherd’s home. He was eleven, and every morning he went down to Dörfli to fetch the goats and drive them up to graze all day in the fragrant mountain meadows above. Then, in the evening, he brought them down again, leaping with them over the hillside almost as nimbly as they did. He always gave a shrill whistle through his fingers when he reached the village so that the owners could come and collect their animals. It was usually children who answered the call – not even the youngest was afraid of these gentle goats. During the summer months this was the only chance Peter had of seeing other boys and girls. For the rest of the time, goats were his only companions. He spent very little time at home with his mother and his old blind grandmother who lived with them. He used to leave the hut very early, after bolting his breakfast of a piece of bread and a mug of milk, and he always stayed as long as possible with the children in Dörfli, so he only got back in time to gobble his supper and tumble straight into bed. His father had been the goatherd before him, but he had been killed several years ago, when felling a tree. His mother’s name was Bridget, but she was seldom called anything but ‘the goatherd’s mother’, and his grandmother was just Grannie to everyone, old and young alike.","At sundown he went skipping down the mountain again with his light-footed animals. When he reached Doerfli he would give a shrill whistle, whereupon all the owners of the goats would come out to take home the animals that belonged to them. Dete had been standing for a good ten minutes looking about her in every direction for some sign of the children and the goats. Meanwhile Heidi and the goatherd were climbing up by a far and roundabout way, for Peter knew many spots where all kinds of good food, in the shape of shrubs and plants, grew for his goats."

He asked her to hurry, for preparations for a journey had to be made.","Home Again Mr Sesemann went upstairs feeling both anxious and annoyed, and he knocked loudly on Miss Rotten‐meier’s door. She awoke with a start to hear him say, ‘Please get up quickly and come to the dining‐room. We have to make preparations for a journey.’","At daylight Mr. Sesemann went quickly upstairs and along the passage to Miss Rottermeyer's room, and there gave such an unusually loud knock at the door that the lady awoke from sleep with a cry of alarm."

"Aber Heidi ließ sich nicht stören in seiner Freude, es jauchzte und hüpfte in der Stube herum und rief ein Mal übers andere: ""Jetzt kann die Großmutter jeden Tag ein Brötchen essen und wird wieder ganz kräftig, und--oh, Großmutter"", rief es mit neuem Jubel, ""wenn du dann so gesund wirst, so wird es dir gewiss auch wieder hell, es ist vielleicht nur, weil du so schwach bist.""","But Heidi did not let her joy be disturbed, she cheered and jumped around the room and called out one after the other: ""Now grandmother can eat a roll every day and is getting quite strong again, and -- oh, grandmother,"" cried with renewed jubilation, ""if you get well then, you'll certainly feel light again, maybe it's just because you're so weak.""","But Heidi did not listen but jumped gaily about the little room, calling over and over again: ""Now grandmother can have a roll every day.","Heidi paid no attention but pranced round the room, singing, ‘Now Grannie can have a fresh roll every day and will soon be strong again!

"""Es ist ja wirklich völlig wunderbar"", sagte er endlich, ""nicht nur, dass das junge Mädchen nach all meinen gründlichen Erklärungen, und ungewöhnlichen Bemühungen das Abc nicht erlernt hat, sondern auch und besonders, dass es jetzt in kürzester Zeit, nachdem ich mich entschlossen hatte, das Unerreichbare aus den Augen zu lassen und ohne alle weiter greifenden Erläuterungen nur noch sozusagen die nackten Buchstaben vor die Augen des jungen Mädchens zu bringen, sozusagen über Nacht das Lesen erfasst hat, und dann sogleich mit einer Korrektheit die Worte liest, wie mir bei Anfängern noch selten vorgekommen ist. Fast ebenso wunderbar ist mir die Wahrnehmung, dass die gnädige Frau gerade diese fern liegende Tatsache als Möglichkeit vermutete.""","""It's really absolutely wonderful,"" he said at last, ""not only that the young girl, after all my thorough explanations and unusual efforts, hasn't learned her ABCs, but also and especially that it is now in a very short time after I I had decided to let the unattainable out of my sight and, without any further-reaching explanations, just bring the bare letters before the young girl's eyes, so to speak, took hold of reading overnight, so to speak, and then immediately read the words with a correctness as I have seldom seen with beginners. It is almost as wonderful to me to realize that Madame suspected precisely this remote fact as a possibility.""","Being called to the lady's room, he began: ""Mrs. Sesemann, something has happened that I never expected,"" and with many more words the happy grandmama was told that Heidi had suddenly learned to read with the utmost correctness, most rare with beginners.","‘Why, that you should suggest such a possibility, Madam, is almost as surprising as the fact itself. Up till now, in spite of all my efforts, she seemed quite unable to learn even the letters, and I had reluctantly come to the conclusion that she would have to be left to try to learn them in her own way, without any further help from me. Now she has mastered them almost overnight, as it were, and can read – and more correctly than most beginners. It’s really remarkable.’","Now she has learnt her letters and started at once to read correctly, quite unlike most beginners."""
"Nun fing er an zu pfeifen und sagte nichts mehr, und Heidi schaute um sich und fing an innerlich zu zittern vor Erregung, denn es erkannte die Bäume am Wege, und drüben standen die hohen Zacken des Falknis-Berges und schauten zu ihm herüber, so als grüßten sie es wie gute alte Freunde; und Heidi grüßte wieder, und mit jedem Schritt vorwärts wurde Heidis Erwartung gespannter, und es meinte, es müsse vom Wagen herunterspringen und aus allen Kräften laufen, bis es ganz oben wäre. Aber es blieb doch still sitzen und rührte sich nicht, aber alles zitterte an ihm. Jetzt fuhren sie im Dörfli ein, eben schlug die Glocke fünf Uhr. Augenblicklich sammelte sich eine Gesellschaft von Kindern und Frauen um den Wagen herum, und ein paar Nachbarn traten auch noch herzu, denn der Koffer und das Kind auf des Bäckers Wagen hatten die Aufmerksamkeit aller Umwohnenden auf sich gezogen, und jeder wollte wissen, woher und wohin und wem beide zugehörten. Als der Bäcker Heidi heruntergehoben hatte, sagte es eilig: ""Danke, der Großvater holt dann schon den Koffer"", und wollte davonrennen. Aber von allen Seiten wurde es festgehalten, und eine Menge von Stimmen fragten alle auf einmal, jede etwas Eigenes. Heidi drängte sich mit einer solchen Angst auf dem Gesichte durch die Leute, dass man ihm unwillkürlich Platz machte und es laufen ließ, und einer sagte zum anderen: ""Du siehst ja, wie es sich fürchtet, es hat auch alle Ursache."" Und dann fingen sie noch an, sich zu erzählen, wie der Alm-Öhi seit einem Jahr noch viel ärger geworden sei als vorher und mit keinem Menschen mehr ein Wort rede und ein Gesicht mache, als wolle er am liebsten jeden umbringen, der ihm in den Weg komme, und wenn das Kind auf der ganzen Welt noch wüsste wohin, so liefe es nicht in das alte Drachennest hinauf. Aber hier fiel der Bäcker in das Gespräch ein und sagte, er werde wohl mehr wissen als sie alle, und erzählte dann sehr geheimnisvoll, wie ein Herr das Kind bis nach Maienfeld gebracht und es ganz freundlich entlassen habe und auch gleich ohne Markten ihm den geforderten Fahrpreis und dazu noch ein Trinkgeld gegeben habe, und überhaupt könne er sicher sagen, dass es dem Kind wohl genug gewesen sei, wo es war, und es selbst begehrt habe, zum Großvater zurückzugehen. Diese Nachricht brachte eine große Verwunderung hervor und wurde nun gleich im ganzen Dörfli so verbreitet, dass noch am gleichen Abend kein Haus daselbst war, in dem man nicht davon redete, dass das Heidi aus allem Wohlleben zum Großvater zurückbegehrt habe.","Now he began to whistle and said nothing more, and Heidi looked around and began to tremble inwardly with excitement, because she recognized the trees by the way, and over there stood the high peaks of the Falknis mountain and looked over at him, like that as if they greeted it like good old friends; and Heidi said hello again, and with every step forward Heidi's expectation became more tense, and she thought she had to jump down from the carriage and run with all her strength until she was at the top. But it stayed still and didn't move, but everything about it trembled. Now they were driving into Dörfli, the bell just struck five o'clock. Immediately a company of children and women gathered around the wagon, and a few neighbors also came up, because the suitcase and the child on the baker's wagon had attracted the attention of all those living in the vicinity, and everyone wanted to know where they were coming from and where they were going and to whom both belonged. When the baker had lifted Heidi down, she said in a hurry: ""Thanks, grandfather will get the suitcase then,"" and wanted to run away. But it was held fast from all sides, and a crowd of voices asked all at once, each with something of its own. Heidi pushed her way through the crowd with such fear on her face that they involuntarily made room for her and let her run, and one said to the other: ""You can see how afraid she is, she has every reason."" And then they began to tell each other how Alm-Öhi had become even worse than before and didn't speak a word to anyone anymore and made a face as if he wanted to kill everyone who was in his way come my way, and if the child in the whole world knew where to go, it wouldn't run up into the old dragon's nest. But here the baker joined the conversation and said that he would probably know more than all of them, and then he told me very mysteriously how a gentleman had brought the child to Maienfeld and dismissed him in a very friendly manner and without even asking him what he was asking for I gave him the fare plus a tip, and he could say with certainty that the child was happy with where it was and wanted to go back to grandfather himself. This news caused a great astonishment and was then immediately spread throughout the whole of Dorfli, so that on the same evening there was not a house there in which they were not saying that Heidi had wanted to go back to her grandfather out of all her good life.","They conversed no more, and Heidi began to tremble with excitement when she recognized all the trees on the road and the lofty peaks of the mountains. Sometimes she felt as if she could not sit still any longer, but had to jump down and run with all her might. They arrived at the village at the stroke of five. Immediately a large group of women and children surrounded the cart, for the trunk and the little passenger had attracted everybody's notice. When Heidi had been lifted down, she found herself held and questioned on all sides. But when they saw how frightened she was, they let her go at last. The baker had to tell of Heidi's arrival with the strange gentleman, and assured all the people that Heidi loved her grandfather with all her heart, let the people say what they would about him.","He began to whistle then, and said no more. Heidi looked around with growing delight at the mountain peaks she knew so well and which seemed to greet her like old friends. She wanted to jump down from the cart and run the rest of the way, but she managed to sit still, though she was shivering with excitement. They reached Dörfli just as the clock struck five, and there was soon a little crowd of villagers round the cart, curious to find out about the child and the trunk which had come in on it. The baker lifted Heidi down. ‘ Thank you,’ she said hastily. ‘Grandfather will come and fetch the trunk,’ and she turned to run off home at once, but the villagers crowded round her, with a string of questions. She struggled through them, looking so pale and anxious that they murmured among themselves, as they let her go, ‘You can see how frightened she looks, and no wonder,’ and they added, ‘If the poor child had anywhere else in the world to go, she’d never come running back to that old dragon.’ The baker, aware that he was the only person who knew anything on that subject, now spoke up. ‘ A gentleman brought her to Mayenfeld and said goodbye to her in a very friendly way, and he gave me what I asked for bringing her up here without any haggling, and something over as well. She has been well treated, wherever she’s been, and has come home of her own accord.’ These little bits of news spread so rapidly that before nightfall every house in the village knew that Heidi had left a good home in Frankfurt to come back, of her own accord, to her grandfather.","He began whistling and said no more, while Heidi looked around her and began to tremble with excitement, for she knew every tree along the way, and there overhead were the high jagged peaks of the mountain looking down on her like old friends. She nodded back to them, and grew every moment more wild with her joy and longing, feeling as if she must jump down from the cart and run with all her might till she reached the top. The clock was striking five as they drove into Doerfli. As the miller lifted Heidi down, she said hastily, ""Thank you, grandfather will send for the trunk."" She climbed up the steep path from Doerfli as quickly as she could; she was obliged, however, to pause now and again to take breath, for the basket she carried was rather heavy, and the way got steeper as she drew nearer the top."
"""Die güldne Sonne Voll","""The golden sun full","But Heidi did not listen but jumped gaily about the little room, calling over and over again: ""Now grandmother can have a roll every day.",‘The golden sun,"And Heidi began, reading with more and more warmth of expression as she went on,—"
"Aber gerade dieser freundlichen Großmama wollte Heidi nicht sich so undankbar zeigen, dass sie vielleicht nachher gar nicht mehr so freundlich wäre; so sagte Heidi traurig: ""Man kann es nicht sagen.""","But Heidi didn't want to be so ungrateful to this friendly grandmother that she might not be so friendly afterwards; so Heidi said sadly: ""You can't say it.""","What is making you so sad?"" But as Heidi did not want to appear thankless, she replied sadly: ""I can't tell you.""","Heidi was afraid of vexing her if she told her the truth, and answered, ‘I can’t tell you.’","But Heidi, afraid if she told the truth that the grandmother would think her ungrateful, and would then leave off being so kind to her, answered, ""I can't tell you."""
"Mit diesen Worten fuhr Fräulein Rottenmeier an Sebastian vorbei und rief nach der Tinette mit so wenig einladendem Ton, dass die Jungfer Tinette mit noch viel kleineren Schritten herantrippelte als sonst gewöhnlich--und sich mit so spöttischem Gesicht hinstellte, dass selbst Fräulein Rottenmeier nicht wagte, sie anzufahren; umso mehr schlug ihr die Aufregung nach innen.",With these words Fraulein Rottenmeier drove past Sebastian and called for Tinette in such an uninviting tone that the maid Tinette trotted up with much smaller steps than usual--and stood there with such a mocking face that even Fraulein Rottenmeier didn't dare to approach them; the more the excitement hit her inside.,"She was in a very excited mood, for she felt responsible for Heidi's coming and did not know how to cancel this unfortunate step.","‘Finish your thinking some other time and see about serving the meal,’ she snapped, and then called, in a peremptory tone, for Tinette, who minced into the room with a very high and mighty expression on her face which made even Miss Rottenmeier swallow her anger, and she said as coolly as she could, ‘See that the room is prepared for the girl who has just come.","Make haste, Sebastian, or we shall get no dinner today at all,"" she said."
"""Er lacht freundlich und hat eine dicke goldene Kette und ein goldenes Ding hängt daran mit einem großen roten Stein und auf seinem Stock ist ein Rosskopf.""","""He laughs kindly and has a thick gold chain and a gold thing hanging from it with a big red stone and on his stick is a horse's head.""","""He has a friendly laugh and wears a gold pendant with a red stone on his thick gold chain; there is a horsehead on his cane.""","‘He had a nice smile, and wore a thick gold chain with a gold thing hanging on it which had a red stone in the middle.

"""Du stehst ja doch nur und reißest deine Augen auf und kommst, denk ich, nicht weit auf die Art!"", rief ihm die Base Dete zu. ""Komm her, du musst etwas Schönes haben, siehst du?"" Sie hielt ihm ein neues Fünferchen hin, das glänzte ihm in die Augen. Plötzlich sprang er auf und davon auf dem geradesten Weg die Alm hinunter und kam in ungeheuren Sätzen in kurzer Zeit bei dem Häuflein Kleider an, packte sie auf und erschien damit so schnell, dass ihn die Base rühmen musste und ihm sogleich sein Fünfrappenstück überreichte. Peter steckte es schnell tief in seine Tasche, und sein Gesicht glänzte und lachte in voller Breite, denn ein solcher Schatz wurde ihm nicht oft zuteil.","""You're just standing there and widening your eyes and I don't think you'll get very far that way!"" cried Cousin Dete to him. ""Come here, you must have something nice, see?"" She held out a new fiver, which shone in his eyes. Suddenly he jumped up and took the straightest path down the mountain pasture and, in huge leaps, quickly arrived at the little pile of clothes, packed them up and appeared so quickly that the cousin had to praise him and immediately handed him his five-centime coin. Peter quickly tucked it deep into his pocket, and his face was all smiles and laughter, for such a treasure was not often bestowed on him.","""There you are, standing and staring, but that won't get you further,"" said Deta. ""I'll give you this if you go down."" With that she held a five-penny-piece under his eyes. That made Peter start and in a great hurry he ran down the straightest path. He arrived again in so short a time that Deta had to praise him and gave him her little coin without delay. He did not often get such a treasure, and therefore his face was beaming and he laughingly dropped the money deep into his pocket.","‘Well, you won’t get very far, if you just stand there, staring,’ said Detie. ‘Look here’s something for you.’ She made her tone more persuasive, and held out a bright new coin. The sight of this stirred him to action, and he dashed off with giant strides down the steep slope. He snatched up the pile of clothes and was back with them in no time. Detie had to admit that he had earned his reward. He tucked the coin away, deep down in his pocket, with a very broad grin, for such riches did not often come his way.",""" Peter, you go down and fetch them for me as quickly as you can, and you shall have something nice,"" and she held out a bright new piece of money to him that sparkled in the sun. Peter was immediately off down the steep mountain side, taking the shortest cut, and was back again so quickly with the clothes that even Dete was obliged to give him a word of praise as she handed him the promised money. Peter promptly thrust it into his pocket and his face beamed with delight, for it was not often that he was the happy possessor of such riches."
"Aber auf einmal sprang Peter auf und setzte in großen Sprüngen den Geißen nach, und das Heidi lief hintendrein; da musste etwas begegnet sein, es konnte da nicht zurückbleiben. Der Peter sprang durch den Geißenrudel durch der Seite der Alm zu, wo die Felsen schroff und kahl weit hinabstiegen und ein unbesonnenes Geißlein, wenn es dorthin ging, leicht hinunterstürzen und alle Beine brechen konnte. Er hatte gesehen, wie der vorwitzige Distelfink nach jener Seite hin gehüpft war, und kam noch gerade recht, denn eben sprang das Geißlein dem Rande des Abgrundes zu. Peter wollte es eben packen, da stürzte er auf den Boden und konnte nur noch im Sturze ein Bein des Tierleins erwischen und es daran festhalten. Der Distelfink meckerte voller Zorn und Überraschung, dass er so am Bein festgehalten und am Fortsetzen seines fröhlichen Streifzuges gehindert war, und strebte eigensinnig vorwärts. Der Peter schrie nach Heidi, dass es ihm beistehe, denn er konnte nicht aufstehen und riss dem Distelfink fast das Bein aus. Heidi war schon da und erkannte gleich die schlimme Lage der beiden. Es riss schnell einige wohlduftende Kräuter aus dem Boden und hielt sie dem Distelfink unter die Nase und sagte begütigend:","But suddenly Peter jumped up and rushed after the goats, and Heidi ran after them; something must have happened there, it couldn't stay behind. Peter sprang through the herd of goats through the side of the pasture, where the rocks descended steeply and bare far down and a careless little goat, if it went there, could easily fall down and break all its legs. He had seen the cheeky goldfinch hop that way, and was just in time, for the little kid sprang to the edge of the abyss. Peter was just about to grab it when he fell to the ground and was only able to catch one of the little animal's legs as he fell and hold on to it. The goldfinch bleated in anger and surprise at being so caught by the leg and prevented from continuing his merry foray, and stubbornly strode forward. Peter yelled for Heidi to help him, because he couldn't get up and almost tore the goldfinch's leg off. Heidi was already there and recognized immediately the bad situation of the two. It quickly grabbed some fragrant herbs from the ground and held them under the goldfinch's nose and said soothingly:","All of a sudden Peter, who had been lying on the ground, jumped up and bounded after the goats. Heidi, knowing that something must have happened, followed him. She saw him running to a dangerous abyss on the side. Peter had noticed how the rash Thistlefinch had gone nearer and nearer to the dangerous spot. Peter only just came in time to prevent the goat from falling down over the very edge. Unfortunately Peter had stumbled over a stone in his hurry and was only able to catch the goat by one leg. The Thistlefinch, being enraged to find himself stopped in his charming ramble, bleated furiously. Not being able to get up, Peter loudly called for help. Heidi immediately saw that Peter was nearly pulling off the animal's leg. She quickly picked some fragrant herbs and holding them under the animal's nose, she said soothingly: ""Come, come, Thistlefinch, and be sensible.","Then he suddenly jumped up and ran after his herd, with Heidi close behind, anxious not to miss anything. He had noticed that inquisitive little Finch was right at the edge of the ravine, where the ground fell away so steeply that if it went any farther, it might go over and would certainly break its legs. Peter stretched out his hands to catch hold of the little kid, but he slipped and fell, though he managed to grasp one of its legs and Finch, highly indignant at such treatment, struggled wildly to get away. ‘Heidi, come here,’ called Peter, ‘come and help.’ He couldn’t get up unless he let go of Finch ’s leg which he was nearly pulling out of its socket already. Heidi saw at once what to do, and pulled up a handful of grass which she held under Finch’s nose.","All of a sudden Peter leaped to his feet and ran hastily after the goats. Heidi followed him as fast as she could, for she was too eager to know what had happened to stay behind. Peter dashed through the middle of the flock towards that side of the mountain where the rocks fell perpendicularly to a great depth below, and where any thoughtless goat, if it went too near, might fall over and break all its legs. He had caught sight of the inquisitive Greenfinch taking leaps in that direction, and he was only just in time, for the animal had already sprung to the edge of the abyss. All Peter could do was to throw himself down and seize one of her hind legs. Greenfinch, thus taken by surprise, began bleating furiously, angry at being held so fast and prevented from continuing her voyage of discovery. She struggled to get loose, and endeavored so obstinately to leap forward that Peter shouted to Heidi to come and help him, for he could not get up and was afraid of pulling out the goat's leg altogether. Heidi had already run up and she saw at once the danger both Peter and the animal were in. She quickly gathered a bunch of sweet-smelling leaves, and then, holding them under Greenfinch's nose, said coaxingly, ""Come, come, Greenfinch, you must not be naughty!"
das er noch nicht gehört hat,that he hasn't heard yet,THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HEARS OF STRANGE DOINGS,"There was a great bustle in the big house and much running up and down stairs a few days later, for the master had returned from his travels, and Sebastian and Tinette had one load of luggage after another to carry up from the carriage, for Mr Sesemann always brought a lot of presents and other nice things home with him.",A few days after these events there was great commotion and much running up and down stairs in Mr. Sesemann's house.
"""Da, so kann das Mamsellchen einmal hinausgucken und sehen, was unten ist"", sagte Sebastian, indem er einen hohen hölzernen Schemel herbeigeholt hatte und hinstellte. Hoch erfreut stieg Heidi hinauf und konnte endlich den ersehnten Blick durch das Fenster tun. Aber mit dem Ausdruck der größten Enttäuschung zog es sogleich den Kopf wieder zurück.","""Here, the maid can look out and see what's down there,"" said Sebastian, fetching a high wooden stool and setting it down. Delighted, Heidi climbed upstairs and was finally able to look through the window as she had longed for. But with the expression of the greatest disappointment, it immediately pulled its head back again.","Sebastian got a stool for Heidi, for the window-sill was too high for her to see over. In great disappointment, Heidi turned her head away.","Her chin only came up to the sill, but he brought her a high wooden stool and said, ‘If you climb on that, Miss, you’ll be able to see what’s down below.’ She got up on it, but after a quick glance, turned back with a very disappointed face.","""There, now miss can look out and see what is going on below,"" said Sebastian as he brought her a high wooden stool to stand on. Heidi climbed up, and at last, as she thought, was going to see what she had been longing for. But she drew back her head with a look of great disappointment on her face. * * *"
"""Willst mit auf die Weide?"", fragte der Großvater. Das war dem Heidi eben recht, es hüpfte hoch auf vor Freude.","""Do you want to go to the pasture?"" asked the grandfather. That was fine with Heidi, she jumped up for joy.","""Do you want to go with him to the pasture?"" asked the grandfather. ""Yes,"" cried Heidi, clapping her hands.",‘Do you want to go up to the pasture with Peter?’ asked the old man. This idea clearly delighted her.,"""Do you want to go with them on to the mountain?"" asked her grandfather. Nothing could have pleased Heidi better, and she jumped for joy in answer."
"So kam der Abend heran. Es fing stärker an zu rauschen in den alten Tannen, ein mächtiger Wind fuhr daher und sauste und brauste durch die dichten Wipfel. Das tönte dem Heidi so schön in die Ohren und ins Herz hinein, dass es ganz fröhlich darüber wurde und hüpfte und sprang unter den Tannen umher, als hätte es eine unerhörte Freude erlebt. Der Großvater stand unter der Schopftür und schaute dem Kind zu. Jetzt ertönte ein schriller Pfiff. Heidi hielt an in seinen Sprüngen, der Großvater trat heraus. Von oben herunter kam es gesprungen, Geiß um Geiß, wie eine Jagd, und mittendrin der Peter. Mit einem Freudenruf schoss Heidi mitten in das Rudel hinein und begrüßte die alten Freunde von heute Morgen einen um den anderen. Bei der Hütte angekommen, stand alles still, und aus der Herde heraus kamen zwei schöne, schlanke Geißen, eine weiße und eine braune, auf den Großvater zu und leckten seine Hände, denn er hielt ein wenig Salz darin, wie er jeden Abend zum Empfang seiner zwei Tierlein tat. Der Peter verschwand mit seiner Schar. Heidi streichelte zärtlich die eine und dann die andere von den Geißen und sprang um sie herum, um sie von der anderen Seite auch zu streicheln, und war ganz Glück und Freude über die Tierchen. ""Sind sie unser, Großvater? Sind sie beide unser? Kommen sie in den Stall? Bleiben sie immer bei uns?"", so fragte Heidi hintereinander in seinem Vergnügen, und der Großvater konnte kaum sein stetiges ""Ja, ja!"" zwischen die eine und die andere Frage hineinbringen. Als die Geißen ihr Salz aufgeleckt hatten, sagte der Alte: ""Geh und hol dein Schüsselchen heraus und das Brot.""","So the evening came. It began to rustle louder in the old fir trees, a mighty wind drove along and rushed and roared through the dense treetops. This sounded so beautifully in Heidi's ears and heart that she became very happy about it and jumped and hopped around under the fir trees as if she had experienced unheard-of joy. Grandfather stood under the shop door and watched the child. A shrill whistle sounded. Heidi stopped jumping, grandfather stepped out. It came leaping down from above, goat after goat, like a hunt, and in the middle was Peter. With a shout of joy, Heidi darted into the middle of the pack and greeted the old friends from this morning one by one. Arrived at the hut, everything stood still, and out of the herd two beautiful, slender goats, one white and one brown, came up to grandfather and licked his hands, because he kept a little salt in them, as he did every evening at the reception his two little animals did. Peter disappeared with his crowd. Heidi tenderly stroked one and then the other of the goats and jumped around to stroke them from the other side as well, and was very happy and happy about the little animals. ""Are they ours, grandfather? Are they both ours? Do they come into the stable? Do they always stay with us?"" Heidi asked in succession in his amusement, and the grandfather could hardly contain his steady ""Yes, yes!"" between the one and the other question. When the goats had lapped up their salt, the old man said, ""Go and get out your bowl and the bread.""","At last the evening came. The old fir-trees were rustling and a mighty wind was roaring and howling through the tree-tops. Those sounds thrilled Heidi's heart and filled it with happiness and joy. She danced and jumped about under the trees, for those sounds made her feel as if a wonderful thing had happened to her. The grandfather stood under the door, watching her, when suddenly a shrill whistle was heard. Heidi stood still and the grandfather joined her outside. Down from the heights came one goat after another, with Peter in their midst. Uttering a cry of joy, Heidi ran into the middle of the flock, greeting her old friends. When they had all reached the hut, they stopped on their way and two beautiful slender goats came out of the herd, one of them white and the other brown. They came up to the grandfather, who held out some salt in his hands to them, as he did every night. Heidi tenderly caressed first one and then the other, seeming beside herself with joy. ""Are they ours, grandfather? Do they both belong to us? Are they going to the stable? Are they going to stay with us?"" Heidi kept on asking in her excitement. The grandfather hardly could put in a ""yes, yes, surely"" between her numerous questions. When the goats had licked up all the salt, the old man said, ""Go in, Heidi, and fetch your bowl and the bread.""","Thus the afternoon passed. A strong wind sprang up again, whistling and rustling through the fir trees. The sound pleased Heidi so much that she began dancing and jumping about, and her grandfather stood watching her from the door of the shed. Suddenly there was a shrill whistle and Peter appeared in the midst of his herd of goats. Heidi gave a cry of delight and rushed to greet her friends of the morning. As the goats reached the hut they all stood still, except for two graceful animals, one brown and one white, which detached themselves from the others and went up to the old man. Then they began to lick his hands for he was holding a little salt in them, as he did every evening to welcome them home. Peter went away with the rest of the herd, and Heidi ran to the two goats and began to pat them gently. ‘Are these ours, Grandfather?’ she asked. ‘ Both of them? Do they go into the stall? Will they always be here with us?’ Her questions followed so closely on each other that her grandfather could hardly get an answer in edgeways. When the goats had finished the salt, the old man said, ‘Now go and fetch your mug and the bread.’","And so the time passed happily on till evening. Then the wind began to roar louder than ever through the old fir trees; Heidi listened with delight to the sound, and it filled her heart so full of gladness that she skipped and danced round the old trees, as if some unheard of joy had come to her. The grandfather stood and watched her from the shed. * * * HEIDI TENDERLY STROKED THE TWO GOATS IN TURN HEIDI TENDERLY STROKED THE TWO GOATS IN TURN * * * Suddenly a shrill whistle was heard. Down from the heights above, the goats came springing one after another, with Peter in their midst. Heidi sprang forward with a cry of joy and rushed among the flock, greeting first one and then another of her old friends of the morning. As they neared the hut the goats stood still, and then two of their number, two beautiful, slender animals, one white and one brown, ran forward to where the grandfather was standing and began licking his hands, for he was holding a little salt which he always had ready for his goats on their return home. Peter went on down the mountain with the remainder of his flock. Heidi tenderly stroked the two goats in turn, jumping about in her glee at the pretty little animals. ""Are they ours, Grandfather? Are they both ours? Are you going to put them in the shed? Will they always stay with us?"" Heidi's questions came tumbling out one after the other, so that her grandfather had only time to answer each of them with ""Yes, yes. "" When the goats had finished licking up the salt her grandfather told her to go and fetch her bowl and the bread."
"Heidi stand erschrocken von seinem Sessel auf und wollte noch einmal erklären: ""Ich mache gewiss""--""Miau! Miau! Miau!""","Startled, Heidi got up from her chair and wanted to explain again: ""I'll do it for sure""--""Meow! Meow! Meow!""","OFF THEY STARTED, AND SOON HEIDI WAS PULLING THE DOOR-BELL OFF THEY STARTED, AND SOON HEIDI WAS PULLING THE DOOR-BELLToList Heidi got up. She began again. "" I made—"" ""Meow! meow! meow! —""","Heidi got up, feeling quite frightened. She tried again to explain, but the kittens mewed again, ‘Miaou, miaou, miaou.’","Heidi stood up frightened, and again made an attempt to explain. "" I really did not—"" ""Miau! miau! miau!"""
"""Weil sie das Heidi mitgenommen hat"", erklärte Peter.","""Because she took Heidi with her,"" explained Peter.","""They have taken Heidi away,"" Peter said with a groan.","‘She’s taking Heidi away,’ he shouted.","""She is taking Heidi away,"" explained Peter."
"""Ja, ja, sicher, Großmutter"", rief Heidi nun mit aller Zuversicht, ""weine nur nicht, ich bin ganz gewiss wieder da und komme alle Tage zu dir und gehe nie wieder fort, und du musst auch manchen Tag kein hartes Brot mehr essen, siehst du, Großmutter, siehst du?""","""Yes, yes, of course, grandmother,"" cried Heidi with all confidence, ""just don't cry, I'll definitely be back and come to you every day and never leave again, and some days you won't have hard bread anymore either eat, see, grandmother, see?""","""Yes, yes, grandmother,"" the child replied. ""You must not cry, for I have come and will never leave you any more. Now you won't have to eat hard black bread any more for a little while. Look what I have brought you.""",and I’ll never go away again. I’ll come and see you every day.,"Do not cry, for I have really come back and I am never going away again, and I shall come every day to see you, and you won't have any more hard bread to eat for some days, for look, look!"""
"Der Alm-Öhi gab dem Herrn Pfarrer die Hand und sagte fest und bestimmt: ""Der Herr Pfarrer meint es recht mit mir; aber was er erwartet, das tu ich nicht, ich sag es sicher und ohne Wandel: Das Kind schick ich nicht, und herunter komm ich nicht.""","Alm-Öhi shook hands with the pastor and said firmly and resolutely: ""The pastor means well with me; but I don't do what he expects, I say it confidently and without change: I won't send the child, and I can't get down.""","But the uncle replied firmly, while he shook his visitor by the hand: ""Thank you for your kindness, but you will have to wait in vain.""","Uncle Alp shook hands with him, but said slowly, ‘I know you mean well, but I can’t do what you ask. That’s final. I shan’t send the child to school, nor come back to the village to live.’","Alm-Uncle gave the pastor his hand and answered him calmly and firmly, ""You mean well by me, I know, but I will not send the child to school nor come and live among you."""
"""Wo sind die Felsen?"", fragte Heidi zurück, bewegte sich aber nicht von der Stelle, denn der süße Duft strömte mit jedem Windhauch dem Kinde lieblicher entgegen.","""Where are the rocks?"" Heidi asked back, but didn't move from where she was, because the sweet scent flowed towards the child more sweetly with every breath of wind.","""The grandfather has told me to look out for you, and you must not fall over the rocks."" ""Where are they?"" asked Heidi without even stirring.","‘Where’s that?’ she called, without moving.","Peter had therefore to be on the alert, and his round eyes, which did not move very quickly, had more work than they could well manage, for the goats were as lively as Heidi; they ran in all directions, and Peter had to follow whistling and calling and swinging his stick to get all the runaways together again."
"""Das ist nicht meine Sache"", gab der Bediente zurück; ""klingeln Sie die Jungfer Tinette herunter an der anderen Klingel"", und ohne weitere Auskunft verschwand der Sebastian.","""That's none of my business,"" returned the servant; ""Ring the maid Tinette down the other bell,"" and Sebastian disappeared without further information.","""That's not my business,"" the butler announced. ""Ring for Tinette, the maid."" With that, he disappeared.","‘That’s not my job,’ said Sebastian, ‘ring that other bell for Tinette,’ and he went away.","Tinette, the maid in dainty cap and apron, ushered them upstairs into the library."
"Mit einem Mal wurde die Erzählung unterbrochen durch ein großes Gepolter an der Tür, und herein stampfte der Peter, blieb aber sogleich stille stehen und sperrte seine runden Augen ganz erstaunlich weit auf, als er das Heidi erblickte, und schnitt die allerfreundlichste Grimasse, als es ihm sogleich zurief: ""Guten Abend, Peter!""","Suddenly the story was interrupted by a loud bang at the door, and Peter stomped in, but immediately stopped and opened his round eyes surprisingly wide when he saw Heidi, and made the friendliest grimace when she saw her immediately shouted to him: ""Good evening, Peter!""","Heidi's tale was interrupted suddenly by a great thumping on the door; and who should come in but Peter. No sooner had he seen Heidi, than he smiled, opening his round eyes as wide as possible. Heidi called, ""Good-evening, Peter!""","Suddenly the outer door banged and Peter burst into the room. He pulled up short and stared when he saw Heidi, then gave a very friendly grin as she greeted him.","The conversation was suddenly interrupted by a heavy thump on the door, and in marched Peter, who stood stock-still, opening his eyes with astonishment, when he caught sight of Heidi; then his face beamed with smiles as she called out, ""Good-evening, Peter."""
"Sie lauschten beide. Leise, aber ganz deutlich hörten sie, wie der Balken zurückgeschoben, dann der Schlüssel zweimal im Schloss umgedreht, jetzt die Tür geöffnet wurde. Herr Sesemann fuhr mit der Hand nach seinem Revolver.","They both listened. Quietly, but quite clearly, they heard the beam pushed back, then the key turned twice in the lock, now the door was opened. Herr Sesemann reached for his revolver with his hand.","While they both listened, the bar was unfastened, the key was turned, and the door flew open. Mr. Sesemann seized his revolver.","he asked.

There, at the bottom, standing in the open doorway, was Heidi, looking in amazement up and down the street."
"""Wer da?"", donnerte jetzt der Doktor heraus, dass es durch den ganzen Korridor hallte, und beide Herren traten nun mit Lichtern und Waffen an die Gestalt heran. Sie kehrte sich um und tat einen leisen Schrei. Mit bloßen Füßen im weißen Nachtkleidchen stand Heidi da, schaute mit verwirrten Blicken in die hellen Flammen und auf die Waffen und zitterte und bebte wie ein Blättlein im Winde von oben bis unten. Die Herren schauten einander in großem Erstaunen an.","""Who's there?"" the doctor thundered out so that it echoed through the whole corridor, and both gentlemen now approached the figure with lights and weapons. She turned around and gave a small cry. Heidi stood there with bare feet in a little white nightgown, looked confused at the bright flames and at the weapons and trembled and trembled like a leaf in the wind from top to bottom. The gentlemen looked at each other in great astonishment.","""Who is there?"" thundered the doctor, approaching the figure. It turned and uttered a low shriek. There stood Heidi, with bare feet and in her white night-gown, looking bewildered at the bright light and the weapons. She was shaking with fear, while the two men were looking at her in amazement.","‘Who’s there?’ shouted the doctor so loudly that his voice echoed down the corridor. They both moved towards the front door. The figure turned and gave a little cry. It was Heidi who stood there, barefooted, in her white nightgown, staring in bewilderment at the weapons and the lights. She began to tremble and her lips quivered. The men looked at each other in astonishment.","""Who is there?"" thundered the doctor in a voice that echoed through the hall, as the two men advanced with lights and weapons towards the figure. It turned and gave a low cry.

Mrs. Sesemann interjected here.","Being called to the lady's room, he began: ""Mrs. Sesemann, something has happened that I never expected,"" and with many more words the happy grandmama was told that Heidi had suddenly learned to read with the utmost correctness, most rare with beginners.",‘Are you going to tell me that little Heidi has learnt to read at last?’ asked Mrs Sesemann.,"""It is indeed truly marvelous,"" he said, ""because she never seemed able to even learn her A B C's before.

"""Da, jetzt guck hinunter"", sagte er.","""There, now look down,"" he said.","""","‘Now you have a good look round,’ he said.","She saw beneath her a sea of roofs, towers, and chimney-pots; she quickly drew back her head and said in a sad, disappointed voice, ""It is not at all what I thought."""

"Aber Fräulein Rottenmeier war entschlossen, ihre Tage nicht mehr in Schrecken zuzubringen, und sie wusste sich zu helfen. Bis dahin hatte sie den beiden Kindern nichts von der Geistererscheinung gesagt, denn sie befürchtete, die Kinder würden vor Furcht Tag und Nacht keinen Augenblick mehr allein bleiben wollen, und das konnte sehr unbequeme Folgen für sie haben. Jetzt ging sie stracks ins Studierzimmer hinüber, wo die beiden zusammensaßen, und erzählte mit gedämpfter Stimme von den nächtlichen Erscheinungen eines Unbekannten. Sofort schrie Klara auf, sie bleibe keinen Augenblick mehr allein, der Papa müsse nach Hause kommen und Fräulein Rottenmeier müsse zum Schlafen in ihr Zimmer hinüberziehen, und Heidi dürfe auch nicht mehr allein sein, sonst könne das Gespenst einmal zu ihm kommen und ihm etwas tun; sie wollten alle in _einem_ Zimmer schlafen und die ganze Nacht das Licht brennen lassen, und Tinette müsste nebenan schlafen und der Sebastian und der Johann müssten auch herunterkommen und auf dem Korridor schlafen, dass sie gleich schreien und das Gespenst erschrecken könnten, wenn es etwa die Treppe heraufkommen wollte. Klara war sehr aufgeregt und Fräulein Rottenmeier hatte nun die größte Mühe, sie etwas zu beschwichtigen. Sie versprach ihr, sogleich an den Papa zu schreiben und auch ihr Bett in Klaras Zimmer stellen und sie nie mehr allein lassen zu wollen. Alle konnten sie nicht in demselben Raume schlafen, aber wenn Adelheid sich auch fürchten sollte, so müsste Tinette ihr Nachtlager bei ihr aufschlagen. Aber Heidi fürchtete sich mehr vor der Tinette als vor Gespenstern, von denen das Kind noch gar nie etwas gehört hatte, und es erklärte gleich, es fürchte das Gespenst nicht und wolle schon allein in seinem Zimmer bleiben. Hierauf eilte Fräulein Rottenmeier an ihren Schreibtisch und schrieb an Herrn Sesemann, die unheimlichen Vorgänge im Hause, die allnächtlich sich wiederholten, hätten die zarte Konstitution seiner Tochter dergestalt erschüttert, dass die schlimmsten Folgen zu befürchten seien; man habe Beispiele von plötzlich eintretenden epileptischen Zufällen oder Veitstanz in solchen Verhältnissen, und seine Tochter sei allem ausgesetzt, wenn dieser Zustand des Schreckens im Hause nicht gehoben werde.","But Fraulein Rottenmeier was determined not to spend her days in terror any longer, and she knew how to help herself. Until then she had not told the two children about the apparition, because she feared that the children would not want to be left alone for a moment, day or night, and this could have very uncomfortable consequences for them. Now she went straight to the study, where the two were sitting together, and in a low voice told of the nocturnal apparitions of an unknown man. Immediately Klara cried out that she would not be left alone for a moment, Papa would have to come home and Fraulein Rottenmeier would have to go over to her room to sleep, and Heidi shouldn’t be alone anymore either, otherwise the ghost could come and do something to him ; they all wanted to sleep in _one_ room and leave the light on all night, and Tinette would have to sleep next door and Sebastian and Johann would also have to come down and sleep in the corridor, so that they could scream right away and startle the ghost, if it was them wanted to come up the stairs. Klara was very excited and Fraulein Rottenmeier now had the greatest difficulty in calming her down. She promised her that she would write to Papa right away and also put her bed in Klara's room and that she would never leave her alone again. They couldn't all sleep in the same room, but if Adelheid were also afraid, Tinette would have to camp with her. But Heidi was more afraid of Tinette than of ghosts, which the child had never heard of before, and she declared straight away that she wasn't afraid of the ghost and wanted to stay alone in her room. Fraulein Rottenmeier then hurried to her desk and wrote to Herr Sesemann that the uncanny happenings in the house, which were repeated every night, had so shaken his daughter's delicate constitution that the worst consequences were to be feared; one has examples of suddenly occurring epileptic accidents or St. Vitus's dance in such circumstances, and his daughter is exposed to everything if this state of terror is not relieved in the house.","Clara, at the uncanny tale, immediately exclaimed that she would not stay alone another moment and that she wished her father to come home. The housekeeper arranged to sleep with the frightened child, while Heidi, who did not know what ghosts were, was perfectly unmoved. Another letter was despatched to Mr. Sesemann, telling him that the excitement might have serious effects on his daughter's delicate constitution, and mentioning several misfortunes that might probably happen if he did not relieve the household from this terror.","Miss Rottenmeier was not inclined to endure much more, and she had a shrewd idea how to make the Sesemanns take notice of her complaint. So far she had not told the children anything, as she was afraid they would be too frightened ever to be left alone – and that would have been most tiresome. Now, however, she went straight to the study and told them in a hoarse whisper about the nightly visitations. Clara at once demanded that she should not be left alone, never, not for a single second. ‘Papa must come home. You must sleep in my room,’ she cried. ‘Heidi mustn’t be left alone either, in case the ghost does anything to her. We’d better all stay together in one room and keep the light on all night, and Tinette will have to sleep in the next room and John and Sebastian had better be out in the corridor so that they can frighten the ghost away if it comes upstairs.’ Clara was thoroughly worked up by that time, and Miss Rottenmeier had great difficulty in calming her. ‘I’ll write at once to your papa,’ she promised, ‘and put my bed in your room so that you’re never alone. But we can’t all sleep in one room. If Adelheid is frightened Tinette shall put up a bed in her room.’ But Heidi was much more afraid of Tinette than of ghosts, of which indeed she had never heard, so she said she was not frightened and would sleep alone in her own room. Miss Rottenmeier then went to her desk and wrote dutifully to Mr Sesemann to let him know that the mysterious happenings in the house still continued, and were threatening to have a very bad effect on Clara in her delicate state of health. ‘Fright might even send her into fits,’ she wrote, ‘or bring on an attack of St Vitus’ dance.’","Miss Rottermeyer, however, was determined not to pass any more days in a state of fear, and she knew the right course to pursue. She had as yet said nothing to the children of the ghostly apparitions, for she knew if she did that the children would not remain alone for a single moment, and that might entail discomfort for herself. But now she walked straight off into the study, and there in a low, mysterious voice told the two children everything that had taken place. Clara immediately screamed out that she could not remain another minute alone, her father must come home. So Miss Rottermeyer wrote another letter to Mr. Sesemann, stating that these unaccountable things that were going on in the house had so affected his daughter's delicate constitution that the worst consequences might be expected."
"Die beiden setzten sich an dem festgesetzten Abend hin und fingen gleich an, sich Stärkung zuzutrinken, was sie erst sehr gesprächig und dann ziemlich schläfrig machte, worauf sie beide sich an die Sesselrücken lehnten und verstummten. Als die alte Turmuhr drüben zwölf schlug, ermannte sich Sebastian und rief seinen Kameraden an; der war aber nicht leicht zu erwecken; sooft ihn Sebastian anrief, legte er seinen Kopf von einer Seite der Sessellehne auf die andere und schlief weiter. Sebastian lauschte nunmehr gespannt, er war nun wieder ganz munter geworden. Es war alles mäuschenstill, auch von der Straße war kein Laut mehr zu hören. Sebastian entschlief nicht wieder, denn jetzt wurde es ihm sehr unheimlich in der großen Stille, und er rief den Johann nur noch mit gedämpfter Stimme an und rüttelte ihn von Zeit zu Zeit ein wenig. Endlich, als es droben schon ein Uhr geschlagen hatte, war der Johann wach geworden und wieder zum klaren Bewusstsein gekommen, warum er auf dem Stuhl sitze und nicht in seinem Bett liege. Jetzt fuhr er auf einmal sehr tapfer empor und rief: ""Nun, Sebastian, wir müssen doch einmal hinaus und sehen, wie's steht; du wirst dich ja nicht fürchten. Nur mir nach.""","The two sat down on the appointed evening and immediately began to drink refreshments, which made them very talkative and then quite sleepy, after which they both leaned on the backs of their chairs and fell silent. When the old tower clock struck twelve, Sebastian pulled himself together and called his comrade; but he was not easy to wake up; whenever Sebastian called him, he would tilt his head from one side of the arm of the chair to the other and go back to sleep. Sebastian now listened intently, he was now quite awake again. It was all very quiet, not even a sound could be heard from the street. Sebastian didn't fall asleep again, because now the great silence made him feel very uneasy, and he only called Johann in a muffled voice and shook him a little from time to time. Finally, when one o'clock had already struck upstairs, Johann woke up and regained a clear awareness of why he was sitting on the chair and not lying in his bed. Suddenly he jumped up very bravely and called out: ""Well, Sebastian, we must go out and see how things are; you won't be afraid. Just follow me.""","First they talked, but soon, getting sleepy, they leaned silently back in their chairs. When the clock from the old church tower struck one, Sebastian awoke and roused his comrade, which was no easy matter. At last, however, John was wide awake, and together they went out into the hall.","When evening came they settled down and immediately opened the wine which soon made them talkative. then they grew sleepy and lolled back in their armchairs and fell into a doze. The clock striking twelve brought Sebastian to his senses and he said something to John but John was fast asleep and only settled himself more comfortably into his chair at each effort to rouse him. Sebastian, however, was wide awake now, and listening for unusual sounds. But none came, either from the house or from the street. In fact, the silence was so deep that he grew uneasy. He saw it was no use trying to wake John by calling to him so he shook him, but another hour passed before John was really awake and remembered what he was there for. He got to his feet then, with a fine show of courage, and said: ‘We’d better go and see what’s going on. Don’t be afraid. Just follow me.’","On the appointed night the two sat down and began at once to take some of the strengthening cordial, which at first made them very talkative and then very sleepy, so that they leant back in their seats and became silent. As midnight struck, Sebastian roused himself and called to his companion, who, however, was not easy to wake, and kept rolling his head first to one side and then the other and continuing to sleep. Sebastian began to listen more attentively, for he was wide awake now. He did not feel inclined to go to sleep again, for the stillness was ghostly to him, and he was afraid now to raise his voice to rouse John, so he shook him gently to make him stir. At last, as one struck, John woke up, and came back to the consciousness of why he was sitting in a chair instead of lying in his bed. He got up with a great show of courage and said, ""Come, Sebastian, we must go out in the hall and see what is going on; you need not be afraid, just follow me."""
"""O nein, Großvater"", fing Heidi nun mit Eifer an, ""das musst du nicht glauben, sie waren alle so gut, die Klara und die Großmama und der Herr Sesemann; aber siehst du, Großvater, ich konnte es fast gar nicht mehr aushalten, bis ich wieder bei dir daheim sein könnte, und ich habe manchmal gemeint, ich müsse ganz ersticken, so hat es mich gewürgt; aber ich habe gewiss nichts gesagt, weil es undankbar war. Aber dann auf einmal an einem Morgen rief mich der Herr Sesemann ganz früh--aber ich glaube, der Herr Doktor war schuld daran--aber es steht vielleicht alles in dem Brief""--damit sprang Heidi auf den Boden und holte seinen Brief und seine Rolle aus dem Korb herbei und legte beide in die Hand des Großvaters.","""Oh no, grandfather,"" Heidi began eagerly, ""you don't have to believe that, they were all so good, Klara and grandmother and Herr Sesemann; but you see, grandfather, I almost couldn't do it anymore hold out until I could be home with you again, and I sometimes thought I was going to choke completely, it made me choke, but I certainly didn't say anything because it was ungrateful. But then suddenly one morning he called me Herr Sesemann very early -- but I think it was the doctor's fault -- but maybe it's all in the letter"" -- with that Heidi jumped on the floor and got his letter and roll out of the basket and put them both in grandfather's hand.","""Oh no, you must not think that, grandfather. They all were so good to me; Clara, Mr. Sesemann and grandmama. But grandfather, sometimes I felt as if I could not bear it any longer to be away from you! I thought I should choke; I could not tell any one, for that would have been ungrateful. Suddenly, one morning Mr. Sesemann called me very early, I think it was the doctor's fault and— but I think it is probably written in this letter;"" with that Heidi brought the letter and the bank-roll from her basket, putting them on her grandfather's lap.","‘Oh no, Grandfather, don’t think that. Clara and her father and Grandmamma were all very kind to me. But I was very homesick. I used to get a lump in my throat, as if I was choking. But I didn’t say anything, because they would have thought I was not grateful. Then suddenly Mr Sesemann called me very early one morning – but I think the doctor had something to do with it. Oh, I expect it’s all in the letter.’ She jumped down and ran to fetch the letter and the fat packet.","""Oh, no, Grandfather,"" said Heidi eagerly, ""you must not think that; they were all so kind—Clara, and grandmamma, and Mr. Sesemann. But you see, Grandfather, I used to think I should die, for I felt as if I could not breathe; but I never said anything because it would have been ungrateful. And then suddenly one morning quite early Mr. Sesemann said to me— but I think it was partly the doctor's doing—but perhaps it's all in the letter—"" and Heidi jumped down and fetched the roll and the letter and handed them both to her grandfather."
"Jetzt fragte Sebastian nach dem besten Wege, auf dem man gehen könne, ohne in die Abgründe zu stürzen, und auch wie man einen Koffer nach dem betreffenden Dörfli befördern könnte. Der Mann schaute nach dem Koffer hin und maß ihn ein wenig mit den Augen; dann erklärte er, wenn das Ding nicht zu schwer sei, so wolle er es auf seinen Wagen nehmen, da er selbst nach dem Dörfli fahre, und so gab noch ein Wort das andere, und endlich kamen die beiden überein, der Mann solle Kind und Koffer mit auf seinen Wagen nehmen, und nachher vom Dörfli aus könne das Kind am Abend mit irgendjemand auf die Alm geschickt werden.","Now Sebastian asked about the best way to walk without falling into the abyss, and also how to carry a suitcase to the village in question. The man looked at the suitcase and measured it a little with his eyes; then he explained that if the thing wasn't too heavy he would take it on his wagon, since he was driving to Dorfli himself, and so one word followed another, and finally the two agreed that the man should have a child and Take the suitcase with him to his wagon, and afterwards the child can be sent up to the mountain pasture with someone from Dörfli in the evening.","Sebastian, approaching the man, asked some information concerning the least dangerous ascent to the Alp. After a while it was settled that the man should take Heidi and her trunk to the village and see to it that somebody would go up with her from there.","That did not satisfy Sebastian, who went on to ask how they could best avoid falling down precipices, and how to get a trunk up to Dörfli. The man glanced at it, then said, ‘If it’s not too heavy, I’ll take it on my cart. I’m going to Dörfli myself.’ After that it was a short step to persuade him to take Heidi, as well as her trunk, with him and to send her on the last part of the journey up the mountain with someone from the village.","So Sebastian altered his question and asked which was the best way to avoid falling over the precipice, and also how a trunk could be conveyed to Doerfli. The man looked at it, weighing it with his eye, and then volunteered if it was not too heavy to take it on his own cart, as he was driving to Doerfli. After some little interchange of words it was finally agreed that the man should take both the child and the trunk to Doerfli, and there find some one who could be sent on with Heidi up the mountain."
"""Denkst vielleicht anders, wenn du hinaufkommst"", brummte der Bäcker; ""nimmt mich aber doch wunder"", sagte er dann zu sich selbst, ""es kann wissen, wie's ist.""","""You might think differently when you come upstairs,"" grumbled the baker; ""But it surprises me,"" he then said to himself, ""it can know how it is.""","""You may think differently when you get there,"" muttered the baker. ""It is strange though, for she must know,"" he said to himself.","‘Perhaps you’ll change your mind when you get there,’ muttered the baker, thinking to himself, ‘It’s a rum business, but she must know what it’s like.’","""You will think differently perhaps when you get back there,"" grumbled the miller; and then to himself, "" It's strange of her, for she must know what it's like."""
"Heidi verstand keineswegs eine Einladung unter diesen Worten; auf dem spöttischen Gesicht der Tinette stand viel mehr eine Warnung, ihr nicht zu nah zu kommen, als eine freundliche Einladung geschrieben, und das las Heidi deutlich von dem Gesicht und richtete sich danach. Es nahm den kleinen Schemel unter dem Tisch empor, stellte ihn in eine Ecke, setzte sich darauf und wartete so ganz still ab, was nun kommen würde. Nach einiger Zeit kam etwas mit ziemlichem Geräusch, es war Fräulein Rottenmeier, die schon wieder in Aufregung geraten war und in Heidis Stube hineinrief: ""Was ist mit dir, Adelheid? Begreifst du nicht, was ein Frühstück ist? Komm herüber!""","Heidi in no way understood these words as an invitation; Tinette's mocking face was much more a warning not to approach her than a friendly invitation, and Heidi read that clearly from her face and acted accordingly. She picked up the little stool under the table, put it in a corner, sat on it and waited very quietly for what was to come. After a while something came with quite a noise, it was Fraulein Rottenmeier, who had gotten excited again and called into Heidi's room: ""What's the matter with you, Adelheid? Don't you understand what breakfast is? Come over!""","Heidi did not take this for a summons, for the maid's face was scornful and forbidding. She was waiting patiently for what would happen next, when Miss Rottenmeier burst into the room, saying: ""What is the matter, Adelheid? Didn't you understand? Come to breakfast!""","Heidi hadn’t the least idea what she meant, but she had sounded so fierce that Heidi thought she was being told to stay where she was. She found a little stool under the table and sat down, to see what would happen next. It was not long before Miss Rottenmeier came bustling in, very annoyed, and scolding all the time. ‘What’s the matter with you, Adelheid? Don’t you even know what breakfast is? Come along at once.’","Heidi had no idea what an invitation so worded meant, and Tinette's face did not encourage any questioning on Heidi's part. Heidi was sharp enough to read its expression and acted accordingly. So she drew a little stool out from under the table, put it in the corner and sat down upon it, and there silently awaited what would happen next. Shortly after, Miss Rottermeyer appeared. She seemed very much put out, and called to Heidi, ""What is the matter with you, Adelaide? Don't you understand what breakfast is? Come along at once!"""
Bringt unsern Grenzen,Bring our limits,"But Heidi did not listen but jumped gaily about the little room, calling over and over again: ""Now grandmother can have a roll every day.","His course doth run,","The morning breaks,"
"Mein Auge schauet,",my eye sees,"She'll get well and strong, and,"" she called with fresh delight, ""maybe your eyes will see again, too, when you are strong and well.""","So warm and bright,",And warm and bright
"Wenn aber das am Morgen der Peter vernahm, sah er sehr unglücklich aus, denn er sah lauter Missgeschick vor sich: Einmal wusste er vor Langeweile nun gar nicht mehr, was anfangen, wenn Heidi nicht bei ihm war; dann kam er um sein reichliches Mittagsmahl, und dann waren die Geißen so störrig an diesen Tagen, dass er die doppelte Mühe mit ihnen hatte; denn die waren nun auch so an Heidis Gesellschaft gewöhnt, dass sie nicht vorwärts wollten, wenn es nicht dabei war, und auf alle Seiten rannten. Heidi wurde niemals unglücklich, denn es sah immer irgendetwas Erfreuliches vor sich. Am liebsten ging es schon mit Hirt und Geißen auf die Weide zu den Blumen und zum Raubvogel hinauf, wo so mannigfaltige Dinge zu erleben waren mit all den verschieden gearteten Geißen; aber auch das Hämmern und Sägen und Zimmern des Großvaters war sehr unterhaltend für Heidi; und traf es sich, dass er gerade die schönen runden Geißkäschen zubereitete, wenn es daheim bleiben musste, so war das ein ganz besonderes Vergnügen, dieser merkwürdigen Tätigkeit zuzuschauen, wobei der Großvater beide Arme bloß machte und damit in dem großen Kessel herumrührte. Aber vor allem anziehend war für das Heidi an solchen Windtagen das Wogen und Rauschen in den drei alten Tannen hinter der Hütte. Da musste es immer von Zeit zu Zeit hinlaufen von allem anderen weg, was es auch sein mochte, denn so schön und wunderbar war gar nichts wie dieses tiefe, geheimnisvolle Tosen in den Wipfeln da droben; da stand Heidi unten und lauschte hinauf und konnte niemals genug bekommen, zu sehen und zu hören, wie das wehte und wogte und rauschte in den Bäumen mit großer Macht. Jetzt gab die Sonne nicht mehr heiß wie im Sommer, und Heidi suchte seine Strümpfe und Schuhe hervor und auch den Rock, denn nun wurde es immer frischer, und wenn das Heidi unter den Tannen stand, wurde es durchblasen wie ein dünnes Blättlein, aber es lief doch immer wieder hin und konnte nicht in der Hütte bleiben, wenn es das Windeswehen vernahm.","But when Peter heard that in the morning, he looked very unhappy, because he saw a lot of mishaps ahead of him: once, because of boredom, he no longer knew what to do when Heidi wasn't with him; then he lost his rich midday meal, and then the goats were so stubborn on those days that he had twice as much trouble with them; because they were now so used to Heidi's company that they didn't want to move forward if it wasn't there and ran to all sides. Heidi was never unhappy because she always saw something happy ahead of her. It was best to go with the shepherd and the goats to the pasture, to the flowers and up to the bird of prey, where there were so many different things to experience with all the different kinds of goats; but Grandfather's hammering and sawing and carpentry was also very entertaining for Heidi; and if it happened that he was just preparing the beautiful, round goat cheese when it had to stay at home, it was a special pleasure to watch this strange activity, with which the grandfather bared both arms and stirred the large cauldron with them. But what particularly attracted Heidi on windy days like this was the swaying and rustling in the three old fir trees behind the hut. From time to time it had to run away from everything else, whatever it was, for there was nothing so beautiful and wonderful as that deep, mysterious roaring in the treetops up there; there Heidi stood below and listened up and could never get enough of seeing and hearing how it was blowing and waving and rustling in the trees with great power. Now the sun wasn't as hot as it was in summer, and Heidi looked for his stockings and shoes and also her skirt, because now it was getting colder and cooler, and when Heidi stood under the fir trees, it was blown through like a thin leaf, but it but she kept running and couldn't stay in the hut when she heard the wind blowing.","It always made Peter unhappy when Heidi did not come along, for he saw nothing but misfortunes ahead of him; he hardly knew how to pass his time, and besides, he was deprived of his abundant dinner. The goats were so accustomed to Heidi by this time, that they did not follow Peter when she was not with him. Heidi herself did not mind staying at home, for she loved nothing better than to watch her grandfather with his saw and hammer. Sometimes the grandfather would make small round cheeses on those days, and there was no greater pleasure for Heidi than to see him stir the butter with his bare arms. When the wind would howl through the fir-trees on those stormy days, Heidi would run out to the grove, thrilled and happy by the wondrous roaring in the branches. The sun had lost its vigor, and the child had to put on her shoes and stockings and her little dress. The weather got colder and colder, and when Peter came up in the morning, he would blow into his hands, he was so frozen.","Peter was always very disappointed when Heidi could not go with him. He had grown so used to her company that he found it terribly dull to be by himself again, and of course he missed the good bread and cheese she always shared with him. The goats were twice as troublesome, too, when she was not there. They seemed to miss her and scattered all over the place, as though they were looking for her. But Heidi was happy wherever she was. Of course she loved going up the mountain where there was always so much to see, but she also enjoyed going round with her grandfather, watching him at his carpentry and all the other jobs. She specially liked to see him make the goat’s milk cheese. He rolled up his sleeves and plunged his arms deep into a big pot of milk which he stirred thoroughly with his hands until in due course he produced the delicious round cheeses. But what she liked most of all was the noise the wind made in the old fir trees. She often left what she was doing to go and stand under them with her face turned up, listening and watching the swaying branches as the wind whistled and whirled through them. The wind blew right through her too, though now that the weather was cooler she wore socks and shoes and put on a dress once more. That strange music in the tree tops had a special fascination for her and she could not stay indoors when she heard it.","Whenever Peter heard that he must go alone he looked very unhappy, for he saw nothing but mishaps of all kinds ahead, and did not know how he should bear the long, dull day without Heidi. Then, too, there was the good meal he would miss, and besides that the goats on these days were so naughty and obstinate that he had twice the usual trouble with them, for they had grown so accustomed to Heidi's presence that they would run in every direction and refuse to go on unless she was with them. Heidi was never unhappy, for wherever she was she found something to interest or amuse her. She liked best, it is true, to go out with Peter up to the flowers and the great bird, but she also found her grandfather's hammering and sawing and carpentering very entertaining, and if it should chance to be the day when the large, round goats'-milk cheese was made she enjoyed beyond measure watching her grandfather stir the great cauldron. The thing which attracted her most, however, was the waving and roaring of the three old fir trees on these windy days. She would stand underneath them and look up, unable to tear herself away, looking and listening while they bowed and swayed and roared as the mighty wind rushed through them. There was no longer now the warm, bright sun that had shone all through the summer, so Heidi went to the cupboard and got out her shoes and stockings and dress. Then it grew very cold, and Peter would come up early in the morning blowing on his fingers to keep them warm."
"Die Großmutter schwieg stille, und nun fing Heidi an, ihr mit großer Lebendigkeit zu erzählen von seinem Leben mit dem Großvater und von den Tagen auf der Weide und von dem jetzigen Winterleben mit dem Großvater, was er alles aus Holz machen könne, Bänke und Stühle und schöne Krippen, wo man für das Schwänli und Bärli das Heu hineinlegen könnte, und einen neuen großen Wassertrog zum Baden im Sommer, und ein neues Milchschüsselchen und Löffel, und Heidi wurde immer eifriger im Beschreiben all der schönen Sachen, die so auf einmal aus einem Stück Holz herauskommen, und wie es dann neben dem Großvater stehe und ihm zuschaue und wie es das alles auch einmal machen wolle. Die Großmutter hörte mit großer Aufmerksamkeit zu, und von Zeit zu Zeit sagte sie dazwischen: ""Hörst du's auch, Brigitte? Hörst du, was es vom Öhi sagt?""","Grandmother was silent, and now Heidi began to tell her with great vivacity about his life with grandfather and the days on the pasture and about the current winter life with grandfather, everything he could make out of wood, benches and chairs and beautiful mangers, where you could put the hay for the swan and bear, and a new big water trough for bathing in summer, and a new milk bowl and spoon, and Heidi became more and more eager to describe all the beautiful things that came out all at once come out of a piece of wood and how she then stands next to grandfather and watches him and how she wants to do it all one day. Grandmother listened with great attention, and from time to time she interjected: ""Do you hear it too, Brigitte? Do you hear what it says about Öhi?""","The old woman remained silent, and Heidi, with the greatest vivacity, began to describe her life with the grandfather. Listening attentively, the two women would say to each other sometimes: ""Do you hear what she says about the uncle? Did you listen?""","He’ll be able to make you see, and he’ll mend the hut too. He can do anything.’ Grannie did not contradict her, and Heidi began to chatter away telling everything she did up there, both in summer and in winter. She told how clever Grandfather was at making things, how he had made stools and chairs and new mangers for the goats, and even a bath tub, and a milk bowl, yes, and spoons – all out of wood. Grannie understood from her voice how eagerly she must have watched him at work. ‘I’d like to be able to make things like that myself one day,’ Heidi ended up. ‘Did you hear that, Bridget?’ Grannie asked her daughter. ‘ Fancy Uncle doing all that!’","Heidi now began to give a lively description of her life with the grandfather, and of the days she spent on the mountain with the goats, and then went on to tell what she did during the winter, and how her grandfather was able to make all sorts of things, seats and stools, and mangers where the hay was put for Little Swan and Little Bear, besides a new large water-tub for her to bathe in when the summer came, and a new milk-bowl and spoon. The grandmother listened with the greatest attention, only from time to time addressing her daughter, ""Do you hear that, Brigitta? Do you hear what she is saying about Uncle?"""
"""Was muss ich dir dann wieder geben?""","""What do I have to give you back then?""","In an angry voice, he said: ""How do you dare to ring for me?",‘What do you want?’,"""What will you give me then for that?"""

Just tell me whether you have been alarmed by her bringing animals into the house and what you think of her in general as a companion for my daughter.’","""My good friend,"" interrupted Mr. Sesemann, ""you are giving yourself more trouble than you need."

But what if I don't have one?"" said the old man.","""What shall we do if I haven't any?"" asked the grandfather.","‘That’s what you think, is it? Suppose I haven’t got one?’","""Oh, that's the way, is it? But suppose I have not got a coverlid?"" said the old man."

""Get up and leave the room.""","""This is enough,"" Miss Rottenmeier tried to say, but her voice was hoarse with fury. ""Get up and leave the room.""","‘That will do,’ Miss Rottenmeier tried to speak firmly, but she was almost choking with anger and could only whisper. ‘Leave the room.’","""Get up and leave the room."""
"Der Junge wies mit dem Zeigefinger auf Heidi und sagte kein Wort. Heidi antwortete: ""Eben auf den Turm wollt ich.""","The boy pointed at Heidi with his index finger and didn't say a word.

"Fräulein Rottenmeier wollte noch einiges bemerken, aber Frau Sesemann hatte sich schon umgewandt und ging rasch ihrem Zimmer zu. Sie musste sich sehr verwundern über die Nachricht von Heidis Beschränktheit und gedachte, die Sache zu untersuchen, jedoch nicht mit dem Herrn Kandidaten, den sie zwar um seines guten Charakters willen sehr schätzte; sie grüßte ihn auch immer, wenn sie mit ihm zusammentraf, überaus freundlich, lief dann aber sehr schnell auf eine andere Seite, um nicht in ein Gespräch mit ihm verwickelt zu werden, denn seine Ausdrucksweise war ihr ein wenig beschwerlich.","Fraulein Rottenmeier wanted to say something else, but Frau Sesemann had already turned around and was going quickly to her room. She was very surprised at the news of Heidi's limitations and thought of investigating the matter, but not with the candidate, whom she held in high esteem for his good character; she always greeted him in a very friendly manner when she met him, but then ran to the other side very quickly so as not to get involved in a conversation with him, for his way of speaking was a little difficult for her.","The housekeeper was going to say more, but the old lady had turned already and gone to her room. She was thinking over what she had heard about Heidi, making up her mind to look into the matter.","Miss Rottenmeier wanted to say something more, but Mrs Sesemann turned and quickly left her room. She was very surprised to hear that Heidi was so slow to learn and made up her mind to find out why. She had no intention of asking Mr Usher, however. She knew he was quite a good man, and she always made a point of greeting him very politely when they happened to meet, but she took good care not to land herself in conversation with him as she found his pompous way of expressing himself quite unbearable.","""That is very strange,"" said Mrs. Sesemann, ""she does not look to me like a child who would be unable to learn her alphabet."" Heidi now appeared and gazed with open-eyed delight and wonder at the beautiful colored pictures in the books which the grandmother gave her to look at."
"Heidi jauchzte auf: ""O juhe! Nun muss die Großmutter gar nie mehr hartes, schwarzes Brot essen, und, o Großvater! Nun ist doch alles so schön wie noch gar nie, seit wir leben!"", und Heidi hüpfte hoch auf an der Hand des Großvaters und jauchzte in die Luft hinauf wie die fröhlichen Vögel des Himmels. Aber auf einmal wurde es ganz ernsthaft und sagte: ""Oh, wenn nun der liebe Gott gleich auf der Stelle getan hätte, was ich so stark erbetete, dann wäre doch alles nicht so geworden, ich wäre nur gleich wieder heimgekommen und hätte der Großmutter nur wenige Brötchen gebracht und hätte ihr nicht lesen können, was ihr wohl macht; aber der liebe Gott hatte schon alles ausgedacht, so viel schöner, als ich es wusste; die Großmama hat es mir gesagt, und nun ist alles so gekommen. Oh, wie bin ich froh, dass der liebe Gott nicht nachgab, wie ich so bat und jammerte! Aber jetzt will ich immer so beten, wie die Großmama sagte, und dem lieben Gott immer danken, und wenn er etwas nicht tut, das ich erbeten will, dann will ich gleich denken: Es geht gewiss wieder wie in Frankfurt, der liebe Gott denkt gewiss etwas viel Besseres aus. Aber wir wollen auch alle Tage beten, gelt Großvater, und wir wollen es nie mehr vergessen, damit der liebe Gott uns auch nicht vergisst.""","Heidi cheered: ""Oh juhe! Now grandmother never has to eat hard, black bread anymore, and, oh grandfather! Now everything is nicer than ever since we were alive!"", And Heidi jumped up on the grandfather's hand and howled up into the air like the merry birds of the sky. But all of a sudden it became very serious and said: ""Oh, if the good Lord had done what I had prayed for so badly, then everything would not have turned out the way it did, I would only have come home straight away and would only have given my grandmother brought a few rolls and couldn't have read her what you're doing; but the good Lord had already figured it all out, so much nicer than I knew; grandma told me, and now everything has turned out the way it is. Oh, how I'm glad that the good Lord didn't give in, as I begged and lamented! But now I always want to pray like grandma said and always thank the good Lord, and if he doesn't do something that I want to ask for, then I want to think right away: It will certainly be like in Frankfurt again, the dear Lord will certainly think of something much better. But we also want to pray every day, says grandfather, and we never want to forget it again, so that the dear Lord doesn't either forgets.""","At this the child gave a bound, shouting: ""Oh grandfather, now grandmother won't ever have to eat hard, black bread any more. Oh, everything is so wonderful now! If God Our Father had done immediately what I prayed for, I should have come home at once and could not have brought half as many rolls to grandmother. I should not have been able to read either. Grandmama told me that God would make everything much better than I could ever dream. I shall always pray from now on, the way grandmama taught me. When God does not give me something I pray for, I shall always remember how everything has worked out for the best this time. We'll pray every day, grandfather, won't we, for otherwise God might forget us.""","‘Well,’ he agreed at last, ‘the money is yours. Do what you like with it. There’ll be enough to buy Grannie rolls for many a long year.’ ‘Good, good! She needn’t ever eat the hard black bread again. Oh, we are having good times, Grandfather, aren’t we?’ and she skipped gaily along beside him. Then all at once she grew serious and said, ‘If God had let me come back to you at once, like I asked in my prayers, none of this would have happened. I should have brought Grannie a few rolls I had saved, but they would soon have been gone, and I wouldn’t have been able to read. God knew what was best, just as Clara’s Grandmamma said He did, and see how perfectly He arranged everything. I’ll always say my prayers after this, as Grandmamma told me to, and if God doesn’t answer them at once I shall know it ’s because He’s planning something better for me, just as He did in Frankfurt. We’ll pray every day, won’t we Grandfather, and we’ll never forget God again, and He won’t forget us.’","But Heidi gave her grandfather no peace till he consented to do what she wanted; she slept a great deal better, she said, on her bed of hay than on her fine pillowed bed in Frankfurt. So at last he said, ""The money is yours, do what you like with it; you can buy bread for grandmother for years to come with it."" Heidi shouted for joy at the thought that grandmother would never need to eat hard black bread any more, and ""Oh, Grandfather!"" she said, ""everything is happier now than it has ever been in our lives before!"" and she sang and skipped along, holding her grandfather's hand as light-hearted as a bird. But all at once she grew quiet and said, ""If God had let me come at once, as I prayed, then everything would have been different, I should only have had a little bread to bring to grandmother, and I should not have been able to read, which is such a comfort to her. So we will pray every day, won't we, Grandfather, and never forgot Him again, or else He may forget us."""

"""Es muss doch etwas daran sein, was der Peter so gesagt hat den Sommer durch vom Alm-Öhi, wenn wir dachten, er wisse es nicht recht"", sagte die Großmutter; ""wer hätte freilich auch glauben können, dass so etwas möglich sei; ich dachte, das Kind lebte keine drei Wochen da oben. Wie sieht es auch aus, Brigitte!"" Diese hatte das Kind unterdessen so von allen Seiten angesehen, dass sie nun wohl berichten konnte, wie es aussah.","""There must be something about what Peter said all summer long about Alm-Öhi, when we thought he didn't really know,"" said grandmother; ""Of course, who could have believed that something like that was possible; I thought the child didn't live up there for three weeks.

""We never thought the child would live more than three weeks with him.

"Aber das Vorhaben saß fest in Heidis Sinn, denn die Großmutter hatte es ja sagen lassen; so musste es sein. So verging kein Tag mehr, an dem das Kind nicht fünf- und sechsmal sagte: ""Großvater, jetzt muss ich gewiss gehen, die Großmutter wartet ja immer auf mich.""","But the project stuck firmly in Heidi's mind, because her grandmother had let it be said; that's how it had to be. Not a day went by when the child didn't say five or six times: ""Grandfather, I must go now, grandmother is always waiting for me.""","Heidi immediately approved of this idea, and her first word next morning was: ""Grandfather, I must go down to grandmother. She is expecting me.""","But the idea was firmly in her head, and day after day she said at least half a dozen times that she really must go or Grannie would be tired of waiting for her.","Not a day passed but what she said five or six times to her grandfather, ""I must certainly go today, the grandmother will be waiting for me."""

"""Doch, Heidi, die Geschichte ist schön"", sagte der Großvater; aber sein Gesicht war so ernsthaft, dass Heidi ganz stille wurde und seine Bilder ansah. Leise schob es noch einmal sein Buch vor den Großvater hin und sagte: ""Sieh, wie es ihm wohl ist"", und zeigte mit seinem Finger auf das Bild des Heimgekehrten, wie er im frischen Kleid neben dem Vater steht und wieder zu ihm gehört als sein Sohn.","""Yes, Heidi, the story is beautiful,"" said Grandfather; but his face was so serious that Heidi became very still and looked at his pictures. Softly she pushed her book in front of her grandfather again and said: ""See how he is doing,"" and pointed with her finger at the picture of the one who had returned, standing next to her father in his fresh clothes and belonging to him again as a child His son.","""Yes, Heidi, it is,"" said the grandfather, but so seriously that Heidi quietly looked at the pictures. ""Look how happy he is,"" she said, pointing to it.","‘It is indeed,’ he replied, but he looked so grave that she too fell silent, and sat looking at the pictures. Presently she pushed the book gently in front of him. ‘You can see how happy he is,’ she said, pointing to the picture of the return of the prodigal son.","""You are right, Heidi; it is a beautiful tale,"" he replied, but he looked so grave as he said it that Heidi grew silent herself and sat looking quietly at her pictures. A few hours later, as she lay fast asleep in her bed, the grandfather went up the ladder and put his lamp down near her bed so that the light fell on the sleeping child."
Heidis Augen leuchteten vor Wonne. Es las ein weißes und dann ein gelb und weiß gestreiftes aus und steckte eins in die rechte und eins in die linke Tasche. Nun ging's die Treppe hinunter.,Heidi's eyes shone with delight. It picked out a white and then a yellow and white striped one and put one in the right and one in the left pocket. Now we went down the stairs.,"Heidi could hardly tear herself away from the pretty things, so the old man put one kitten in each of her pockets to console her. After that she went away.","Heidi’s eyes were shining. She picked out a white kitten, and a tabby, and put one in each pocket. Then they went on down together and found the boy still sitting on the step, waiting for her.","Heidi's eyes shone with delight. She picked up a white kitten and another striped white and yellow, and put one in the right, the other in the left pocket. Then she went downstairs."
"Nachdem die Dete verschwunden war, hatte der Öhi sich wieder auf die Bank hingesetzt und blies nun große Wolken aus seiner Pfeife; dabei starrte er auf den Boden und sagte kein Wort. Derweilen schaute das Heidi vergnüglich um sich, entdeckte den Geißenstall, der an die Hütte angebaut war, und guckte hinein. Es war nichts drin. Das Kind setzte seine Untersuchungen fort und kam hinter die Hütte zu den alten Tannen. Da blies der Wind durch die Äste so stark, dass es sauste und brauste oben in den Wipfeln. Heidi blieb stehen und hörte zu. Als es ein wenig stiller wurde, ging das Kind um die kommende Ecke der Hütte herum und kam vorn wieder zum Großvater zurück. Als es diesen noch in derselben Stellung erblickte, wie es ihn verlassen hatte, stellte es sich vor ihn hin, legte die Hände auf den Rücken und betrachtete ihn. Der Großvater schaute auf. ""Was willst du jetzt tun?"", fragte er, als das Kind immer noch unbeweglich vor ihm stand.","After Dete had disappeared, Öhi sat down on the bench again and blew great clouds out of his whistle; he stared at the floor and said not a word. In the meantime, Heidi looked around happily, discovered the goat pen that was attached to the hut, and looked inside. There was nothing in it. The child continued his investigations and came behind the hut to the old fir trees. The wind blew through the branches so hard that it roared and roared in the treetops. Heidi stopped and listened. When it got a little quieter, the child went around the next corner of the hut and came back to Grandfather in front. When she saw him in the same position as she had left him, she stood in front of him, put her hands behind her back and looked at him. Grandfather looked up. ""What do you want to do now?"" he asked when the child still stood motionless in front of him.","After Deta had disappeared, the Uncle sat down again on the bench, blowing big clouds of smoke out of his pipe. He did not speak, but kept his eyes fastened on the ground. In the meantime Heidi looked about her, and discovering the goat-shed, peeped in. Nothing could be seen inside. Searching for some more interesting thing, she saw the three old fir-trees behind the hut. Here the wind was roaring through the branches and the tree-tops were swaying to and fro. Heidi stood still to listen. After the wind had ceased somewhat, she walked round the hut back to her grandfather. She found him in exactly the same position, and planting herself in front of the old man, with arms folded behind her back, she gazed at him. The grandfather, looking up, saw the child standing motionless before him. ""What do you want to do now?"" he asked her.","As soon as Detie had disappeared, the old man sat down again on the bench. He stared at the ground in silence, blowing great clouds of smoke from his pipe, while Heidi explored her new surroundings with delight. She went up to the goat‐stall which was built on to the side of the hut, but found it empty. Then she went round to the back and stood for a while listening to the noise the wind made whistling through the branches of the old fir trees. Presently it died down, and she came back to the front of the hut, where she found her grandfather still sitting in the same position. As she stood watching him, hands behind her back, he looked up and said, ‘What do you want to do now?’","As soon as Dete had disappeared the old man went back to his bench, and there he remained seated, staring at the ground without uttering a sound, while thick curls of smoke floated upward from his pipe. Heidi, meanwhile, was enjoying herself in her new surroundings; she looked about till she found a shed, built against the hut, where the goats were kept; she peeped in, and saw it was empty. She continued her search but presently came back to where her grandfather was sitting. Seeing that he was in exactly the same position as when she left him, she went and placed herself in front of the old man and said:"
"""Das ist es"", erwiderte Dete, ""ich will mit ihm hinauf zum Öhi, es muss dort bleiben.""","""That's it,"" Dete replied, ""I want to take it up to Öhi, it has to stay there.""","""Yes,"" Deta assured her; ""I am taking her up to the Alm-Uncle and there I want her to remain.""","‘That’s right,’ Detie replied. ‘I’m taking her up to Uncle.","""Yes,"" answered Dete. ""I am taking her up to Uncle, where she must stay."""
"Die Dete hatte wohl zehn Minuten gewartet und sich nach allen Seiten umgesehen, ob die Kinder mit den Geißen noch nirgends zu sehen seien; als dies aber nicht der Fall war, so stieg sie noch ein wenig höher, wo sie besser die ganze Alm bis hinunter übersehen konnte, und guckte nun von hier aus bald dahin, bald dorthin mit Zeichen großer Ungeduld auf dem Gesicht und in den Bewegungen. Unterdessen rückten die Kinder auf einem großen Umwege heran, denn der Peter wusste viele Stellen, wo allerhand Gutes an Sträuchern und Gebüschen für seine Geißen zu nagen war; darum machte er mit seiner Herde vielerlei Wendungen auf dem Wege. Erst war das Kind mühsam nachgeklettert, in seiner schweren Rüstung vor Hitze und Unbequemlichkeit keuchend und alle Kräfte anstrengend. Es sagte kein Wort, blickte aber unverwandt bald auf den Peter, der mit seinen nackten Füßen und leichten Höschen ohne alle Mühe hin und her sprang, bald auf die Geißen, die mit den dünnen, schlanken Beinchen noch leichter über Busch und Stein und steile Abhänge hinaufkletterten. Auf einmal setzte das Kind sich auf den Boden nieder, zog mit großer Schnelligkeit Schuhe und Strümpfe aus, stand wieder auf, zog sein rotes, dickes Halstuch weg, machte sein Röckchen auf, zog es schnell aus und hatte gleich noch eins auszuhäkeln, denn die Base Dete hatte ihm das Sonntagskleidchen über das Alltagszeug angezogen, um der Kürze willen, damit niemand es tragen müsse. Blitzschnell war auch das Alltagsröcklein weg, und nun stand das Kind im leichten Unterröckchen, die bloßen Arme aus den kurzen Hemdärmelchen vergnüglich in die Luft hinausstreckend. Dann legte es schön alles auf ein Häufchen, und nun sprang und kletterte es hinter den Geißen und neben dem Peter her, so leicht als nur eines aus der ganzen Gesellschaft. Der Peter hatte nicht Acht gegeben, was das Kind mache, als es zurückgeblieben war. Wie es nun in der neuen Bekleidung nachgesprungen kam, zog er lustig grinsend das ganze Gesicht auseinander und schaute zurück, und wie er unten das Häuflein Kleider liegen sah, ging sein Gesicht noch ein wenig mehr auseinander, und sein Mund kam fast von einem Ohr bis zum anderen; er sagte aber nichts. Wie nun das Kind sich so frei und leicht fühlte, fing es ein Gespräch mit dem Peter an, und er fing auch an zu reden und musste auf vielerlei antworten, denn das Kind wollte wissen, wie viele Geißen er habe und wohin er mit ihnen gehe und was er dort tue, wo er hinkomme. So langten endlich die Kinder samt den Geißen oben bei der Hütte an und kamen der Base Dete zu Gesicht. Kaum aber hatte diese die herankletternde Gesellschaft erblickt, als sie laut aufschrie: ""Heidi, was machst du? Wie siehst du aus? Wo hast du deinen Rock und den zweiten und das Halstuch? Und ganz neue Schuhe habe ich dir gekauft auf den Berg und dir neue Strümpfe gemacht, und alles fort! Alles fort! Heidi, was machst du, wo hast du alles?""","Dete must have waited ten minutes and looked around to see if the children with the goats were nowhere to be seen; but when this was not the case, she climbed a little higher, where she could better see the whole pasture down, and from here she looked now here and there with signs of great impatience on her face and in her movements. Meanwhile the children were approaching by a long detour, for Peter knew many places where there were all kinds of good shrubs and bushes for his goats to gnaw on; therefore he made many turns on the way with his flock. At first the child had climbed in, panting in his heavy armor from the heat and discomfort and exhausting all his strength. He didn't say a word, but kept his eyes fixed on Peter, who jumped about effortlessly with his bare feet and light panties, and then on the goats, who with their thin, slender little legs climbed bushes and stones and steep slopes even more easily climbed up. Suddenly the child sat down on the floor, took off his shoes and stockings very quickly, stood up again, took off his thick red scarf, undid his skirt, took it off quickly and immediately had another one to crochet, because the Base Dete had put his Sunday dress over his everyday clothes, for the sake of brevity, so that nobody had to wear it. The everyday skirt was gone in a flash, and now the child was standing in a light petticoat, happily stretching his bare arms out of the short shirt sleeves into the air. Then she piled everything up nicely, and now she jumped and climbed after the goats and next to Peter, as easily as just one of the whole company. Peter hadn't paid any attention to what the child was doing when it stayed behind. As soon as she jumped in the new clothes, he spread his whole face, grinning merrily, and looked back, and when he saw the little pile of clothes lying below, his face spread a little more, and his mouth almost came up to one ear on the other hand; but he said nothing. As soon as the child felt so free and light, it started a conversation with Peter, and he also began to talk and had to answer many things, because the child wanted to know how many goats he had and where he was going with them and what he does where he goes. So at last the children, together with the goats, reached the hut upstairs and came face to face with Cousin Dete. But no sooner had she seen the company climbing up than she cried out loud: ""Heidi, what are you doing? How do you look? Where are your skirts and the second one and the scarf? And I bought you brand new shoes on the mountain and I made you new stockings and everything's gone! Everything's gone! Heidi, what are you doing, where's everything?""","Deta waited about ten minutes to see if the children were coming up behind with the goats. As she could not find them anywhere, she climbed up a little higher to get a better view down the valley from there, and peered from side to side with marks of great impatience on her countenance. The children in the meantime were ascending slowly in a zigzag way, Peter always knowing where to find all sorts of good grazing places for his goats where they could nibble. Thus they strayed from side to side. The poor little girl had followed the boy only with the greatest effort and she was panting in her heavy clothes. She was so hot and uncomfortable that she only climbed by exerting all her strength. She did not say anything but looked enviously at Peter, who jumped about so easily in his light trousers and bare feet. She envied even more the goats that climbed over bushes, stones, and steep inclines with their slender legs. Suddenly sitting down on the ground the child swiftly took off her shoes and stockings. Getting up she undid the heavy shawl and the two little dresses. Out she slipped without more ado and stood up in only a light petticoat. In sheer delight at the relief, she threw up her dimpled arms, that were bare up to her short sleeves. To save the trouble of carrying them, her aunt had dressed her in her Sunday clothes over her workday garments. Heidi arranged her dresses neatly in a heap and joined Peter and the goats. She was now as light-footed as any of them. When Peter, who had not paid much attention, saw her suddenly in her light attire, he grinned. Looking back, he saw the little heap of dresses on the ground and then he grinned yet more, till his mouth seemed to reach from ear to ear; but he said never a word. The child, feeling free and comfortable, started to converse with Peter, and he had to answer many questions. She asked him how many goats he had, and where he led them, what he did with them when he got there, and so forth. SHE UNDID THE HEAVY SHAWL AND THE TWO LITTLE DRESSES SHE UNDID THE HEAVY SHAWL AND THE TWO LITTLE DRESSESToList At last the children reached the summit in front of the hut. When Deta saw the little party of climbers she cried out shrilly: ""Heidi, what have you done? What a sight you are! Where are your dresses and your shawl? Are the new shoes gone that I just bought for you, and the new stockings that I made myself? Where are they all, Heidi?""","For several minutes after Barbie had left her, Detie looked anxiously about for the two children with the goats, but there was no sign of them. She climbed a little farther up the path to get a better view and then stopped to look again. She was getting very impatient. The children had strayed far away from the path, for Peter always went his own way up the mountain. What mattered was where his goats would find the best bushes and shrubs to nibble. At first Heidi had scrambled up after him, puffing and panting, for her load of clothes made climbing hard, hot work. She did not complain, but she looked enviously at Peter, running about so freely on bare feet, in comfortable trousers; and at the goats whose nimble little legs carried them so lightly up the steep slopes and over bushes and stones. Then suddenly she sat down and pulled off her boots and stockings. She unwound the thick red scarf and quickly unbuttoned her best dress, which Detie had made her wear on top of her everyday one, to save carrying it. She took off both dresses and stood there in nothing but a little petticoat, waving her bare arms in the air with delight. Then she laid all the clothes together in a neat pile and danced off to catch up with Peter and the goats. He had not noticed what she was doing, and when he caught sight of her running towards him like that, he smiled broadly. He looked back and saw the pile of clothing she had left on the grass, and grinned from ear to ear, but he said nothing. Heidi felt much happier, and free as air, and began to chatter away, asking him a string of questions. He had to tell her how many goats he had, where he was taking them, and what he was going to do when he got there. Presently they reached the hut and came within Detie’s view. As soon as she spotted them she called out shrilly: ‘What on earth have you been doing, Heidi? What a sight you look! What have you done with your frocks? And the scarf? And those good new boots I bought you to come up here in, and the stockings I knitted for you? Wherever have you left them all?’ Heidi calmly pointed to the place where she had undressed.","Meanwhile Heidi and the goatherd were climbing up by a far and roundabout way, for Peter knew many spots where all kinds of good food, in the shape of shrubs and plants, grew for his goats. The child, exhausted with the heat and weight of her thick clothes, panted and struggled after him, at first with some difficulty. She said nothing, but her little eyes kept watching first Peter, as he sprang nimbly hither and thither on his bare feet, clad only in his short, light breeches, and then the slim-legged goats that went leaping over rocks and shrubs. All at once she sat down on the ground, and began pulling off her shoes and stockings. Then she unwound the hot red shawl and took off her frock. But there was still another to unfasten, for Dete had put the Sunday dress on over the everyday one, to save the trouble of carrying it. Quick as lightning the everyday frock followed the other, and now the child stood up, clad only in her light short-sleeved under garment. She stretched out her little bare arms with glee. Leaving all her clothes together in a tidy little heap, she went jumping and climbing up after Peter and the goats as nimbly as any of the party. Now that Heidi was able to move at her ease, she began to enter into conversation with Peter. She asked him how many goats he had, where he was going to with them, and what he had to do when he arrived there. At last, after some time, they came within view of Dete. Hardly had the latter caught sight of the little company climbing up towards her when she shrieked out: ""Heidi, what have you been doing! What a sight you have made of yourself! And where are your two frocks and the red wrapper? And the new shoes I bought, and the new stockings I knitted for you—everything gone! not a thing left! What can you have been thinking of, Heidi; where are all your clothes?"""
"Das Geißlein hatte sich schnell umgewandt und dem Heidi vergnüglich die Kräuter aus der Hand gefressen. Derweilen war der Peter auf seine Füße gekommen und hatte den Distelfink an der Schnur erfasst, an welcher sein Glöckchen um den Hals gebunden war, und Heidi erfasste diese von der anderen Seite, und so führten die beiden den Ausreißer zu der friedlich weidenden Herde zurück. Als ihn aber Peter hier in Sicherheit hatte, erhob er seine Rute und wollte ihn zur Strafe tüchtig durchprügeln, und der Distelfink wich scheu zurück, denn er merkte, was begegnen sollte. Aber Heidi schrie laut auf: ""Nein, Peter, nein, du musst ihn nicht schlagen, sieh, wie er sich fürchtet!""","The little kid quickly turned around and happily ate the herbs out of Heidi's hand. Meanwhile Peter got to his feet and caught the goldfinch by the string on which his little bell was tied around his neck, and Heidi caught her from the other side, and so the two led the runaway back to the peacefully grazing flock. But when Peter had him safely here, he raised his rod and wanted to give him a good beating as punishment, and the goldfinch retreated timidly, for he realized what was about to happen. But Heidi cried out loudly: ""No, Peter, no, you don't have to hit him, look how scared he is!""","The goat turned about and devoured the herbs Heidi held in her hand. When Peter got to his feet, he led back the runaway with Heidi's help. When he had the goat in safety, he raised his rod to beat it for punishment. The goat retreated shyly, for it knew what was coming. Heidi screamed loudly: ""Peter, no, do not beat him! look how scared he is.""","At that the little goat turned round and ate the grass from her hand, and Peter was able to get up. He took hold of the cord, on which a little bell was hung round Finch ’s neck. Heidi took hold of it too, on the other side, and together they brought the runaway safely back to the herd. Then Peter took up his stick to give it a good beating, and seeing what was coming, Finch tried to get out of the way. ‘Don’t beat him,’ pleaded Heidi. ‘ See how frightened he is.’","The young animal turned quickly and began contentedly eating the leaves out of Heidi's hand. Meanwhile Peter got on to his feet again and took hold of Greenfinch by the band round her neck from which her bell was hung, and Heidi taking hold of her in the same way on the other side, they led the wanderer back to the rest of the flock that had remained peacefully feeding. Peter, now he had his goat in safety, lifted his stick in order to give her a good beating as punishment, and Greenfinch seeing what was coming shrank back in fear. But Heidi cried out, ""No, no, Peter, you must not strike her; see how frightened she is!"""
"Der Junge saß noch auf den Stufen draußen, und als nun der Türmer hinter Heidi die Tür zugeschlossen hatte, sagte das Kind: ""Welchen Weg müssen wir nun zu Herrn Sesemanns Haus?""","The boy was still sitting on the steps outside, and when the watchman had closed the door behind Heidi, the child said, ""Which way do we have to go to Herr Sesemann's house?""","The boy was waiting patiently for her, and when she had taken leave of the tower-keeper, she asked the boy: ""Do you know where Mr. Sesemann's house is?""","‘Now, which is the way back to Mr Sesemann’s house?’ Heidi asked him as soon as the keeper had shut the big door behind her.",The boy was still sitting outside on the steps.
"""Du armes Schneehöppli du"", sagte Heidi und drückte das Tierlein zärtlich an sich. ""Aber jammere jetzt nur nicht mehr so; siehst du, ich komme nun jeden Tag mit dir, dann bist du nicht mehr so verlassen, und wenn dir etwas fehlt, kannst du nur zu mir kommen.""","""You poor Schneehöppli you,"" said Heidi and hugged the little animal tenderly. ""But don't whine like that anymore; you see, I come with you every day now, then you won't be so abandoned anymore, and if you need something you can only come to me.""","""Poor little Snowhopper!"" said Heidi, drawing the little creature tenderly to her. ""Don't grieve any more; see, I am coming up with you every day now, and if there is anything the matter, you can come to me.""","‘Poor Snowflake,’ said Heidi, hugging the little animal again. ‘Don’t cry any more. I shall be up here every day now, and you can always come to me if you feel lonely.’","""Oh, you poor little Snowflake!"" exclaimed Heidi, clasping the animal gently to her, ""but do not cry like that any more; see now, I shall come up here with you every day, so that you will not be alone any more, and if you want anything you have only to come to me."""
"""Es geschehen viele wunderbare Dinge im Menschenleben"", bestätigte Frau Sesemann und lächelte vergnüglich; ""es können auch einmal zwei Dinge glücklich zusammentreffen, wie ein neuer Lerneifer und eine neue Lehrmethode, und beide können nichts schaden, Herr Kandidat. Jetzt wollen wir uns freuen, dass das Kind so weit ist, und auf guten Fortgang hoffen.""","""Many wonderful things happen in human life,"" confirmed Mrs. Sesemann and smiled happily; ""Two things can happily coincide once in a while, like a new eagerness to learn and a new teaching method, and neither can do any harm, Mr. Candidate. Now let's be happy that the child is ready and hope for good progress.""","Being called to the lady's room, he began: ""Mrs. Sesemann, something has happened that I never expected,"" and with many more words the happy grandmama was told that Heidi had suddenly learned to read with the utmost correctness, most rare with beginners.","‘There are many strange things in this life,’ agreed Mrs Sesemann, well pleased. ‘Perhaps this time there was a new desire to learn. In any case, let us be thankful the child has got thus far, and let us hope she will continue to make progress.’","Now she has learnt her letters and started at once to read correctly, quite unlike most beginners."""
"Am vierten Tag, als es draußen knisterte und knarrte vor Kälte bei jedem Schritt und die ganze große Schneedecke ringsum hart gefroren war, aber eine schöne Sonne ins Fenster guckte, gerade auf Heidis hohen Stuhl hin, wo es am Mittagsmahl saß, da begann es wieder sein Sprüchlein: ""Heut muss ich aber gewiss zur Großmutter gehen, es währt ihr sonst zu lange."" Da stand der Großvater auf vom Mittagstisch, stieg auf den Heuboden hinauf, brachte den dicken Sack herunter, der Heidis Bettdecke war, und sagte: ""So komm!"" In großer Freude hüpfte das Kind ihm nach in die glitzernde Schneewelt hinaus. In den alten Tannen war es nun ganz still und auf allen Ästen lag der weiße Schnee und in dem Sonnenschein schimmerte und funkelte es überall von den Bäumen in solcher Pracht, dass Heidi hoch aufsprang vor Entzücken und ein Mal übers andere ausrief: ""Komm heraus, Großvater, komm heraus! Es ist lauter Silber und Gold an den Tannen!"" Denn der Großvater war in den Schopf hineingegangen und kam nun heraus mit einem breiten Stoßschlitten: Da war vorn eine Stange angebracht, und von dem flachen Sitz konnte man die Füße nach vorn hinunterhalten und gegen den Schneeboden stemmen und der Fahrt die Weisung geben. Hier setzte sich der Großvater hin, nachdem er erst die Tannen ringsum mit Heidi hatte beschauen müssen, nahm das Kind auf seinen Schoß, wickelte es um und um in den Sack ein, damit es hübsch warm bleibe, und drückte es fest mit dem linken Arm an sich, denn das war nötig bei der kommenden Fahrt. Dann umfasste er mit der rechten Hand die Stange und gab einen Ruck mit beiden Füßen. Da schoss der Schlitten davon die Alm hinab mit einer solchen Schnelligkeit, dass das Heidi meinte, es fliege in der Luft wie ein Vogel, und laut aufjauchzte. Auf einmal stand der Schlitten still, gerade bei der Hütte vom Geißenpeter. Der Großvater stellte das Kind auf den Boden, wickelte es aus seiner Decke heraus und sagte:","On the fourth day, when it was crackling and creaking from the cold with every step outside and the whole great blanket of snow was frozen hard all around, but a beautiful sun was looking in the window, right on Heidi's high chair where she was sitting at lunchtime, then it started again his saying: ""Today I must go to my grandmother, otherwise it will take too long for her."" Then Grandfather got up from the lunch table, climbed up to the hayloft, brought down the thick sack that was Heidi's blanket, and said: ""Come on!"" In great joy the child hopped after him into the glittering snowy world. It was now very quiet in the old fir trees and the white snow lay on all the branches and in the sunshine everything shimmered and sparkled from the trees in such splendor that Heidi jumped up with delight and cried out over and over again: ""Come out, Grandfather, come out! It's all silver and gold on the fir trees!"" Because grandfather had gone into the shed and was now coming out with a wide sledge: there was a pole attached at the front, and from the flat seat one could put one's feet down in front and brace them against the snowy ground and give directions for the ride. Here Grandfather sat down, after he had first had to look at the fir trees all around with Heidi, took the child on his lap, wrapped her up in the sack so that she would stay nice and warm, and hugged her tightly with his left arm in itself, because that was necessary for the coming trip. Then he grabbed the bar with his right hand and gave a jerk with both feet. Then the sled shot down the mountain pasture with such speed that Heidi thought she was flying in the air like a bird and gave a loud whoop. Suddenly the sleigh stopped, right by Goat Peter's hut. The grandfather put the child on the floor, unwrapped him from his blanket and said:","Four days later the sun was shining and the tight-packed frozen snow was crackling under every step. Heidi was sitting at the dinner-table, imploring the old man to let her make the visit then, when he got up, and fetching down her heavy cover, told her to follow him. They went out into the glistening snow; no sound was heard and the snow-laden fir-trees shone and glittered in the sun. Heidi in her transport was running to and fro: ""Grandfather, come out! Oh, look at the trees! They are all covered with silver and gold,"" she called to the grandfather, who had just come out of his workshop with a wide sled. Wrapping the child up in her cover, he put her on the sled, holding her fast. Off they started at such a pace that Heidi shouted for joy, for she seemed to be flying like a bird. The sled had stopped in front of Peter's hut, and grandfather said: ""Go in.","On the fourth day after Peter’s visit the snow froze hard and crackled underfoot, and the sun was shining brightly, straight on to Heidi’s face as she sat on her high chair eating her dinner. Again she said, ‘I must go and see Grannie today, or she’ll think I’m not coming.’ Her grandfather left the table and went up to the loft, from which he brought down the thick sack off her bed. ‘ Come on, then,’ he said, and they went out together. Heidi skipped delightedly into the shining white world. The branches of the fir trees were weighed down with snow which sparkled in the sunshine. Heidi had never seen anything like it. ‘Just look at the trees,’ she cried, ‘they’re all gold and silver.’ Meanwhile Grandfather had dragged a big sledge out of the shed. It had a bar along one side to hold on to, and it was steered by pressing the heels against the ground on one side or the other. To please Heidi he went round with her to look at the snow‐clad trees. Then he sat down on the sledge with her on his knees, well wrapped up in the sack to keep her warm. He held her tightly with his left arm and, taking hold of the bar with his right hand, pushed off with both feet. They went down the mountain so fast that Heidi felt as though she was flying, and screamed with delight. They stopped with a jerk just outside Peter’s hut. Grandfather set her on her feet and took off the sack.","On the fourth day, when Heidi was sitting on her high stool at dinner with the bright sun shining in upon her through the window, she again repeated her little speech, ""I must certainly go down to see the grandmother today, or else I shall keep her waiting too long."" The grandfather rose from the table, climbed up to the hayloft and brought down the thick sack that was Heidi's coverlid, and said, ""Come along then!"" The child skipped out gleefully after him into the glittering world of snow. The old fir trees were standing now quite silent, their branches covered with the white snow, and they looked so lovely as they glittered and sparkled in the sunlight that Heidi jumped for joy at the sight and kept on calling out, ""Come here, come here, Grandfather! The fir trees are all silver and gold!"" The grandfather had gone into the shed and he now came out, dragging a large hand-sleigh; inside there was a low seat, and the sleigh could be pushed forward and guided by the feet of the one who sat upon it with the help of a pole that was fastened to the side. The old man got in and lifted the child on to his lap; then he wrapped her up in the sack, that she might keep nice and warm, and put his left arm closely round her, for it was necessary to hold her tight during the coming journey. He now grasped the pole with his right hand and gave the sleigh a push forward with his two feet. It shot down the mountain side with such rapidity that Heidi thought they were flying through the air like a bird, and shouted aloud with delight. Suddenly they came to a standstill, and there they were at Peter's hut. Her grandfather lifted her out and unwrapped her."
"Sie wurde aber so maßleidig, weil die Frauen von allen Seiten ihr zuriefen: ""Wie kannst du so etwas tun!"", und: ""Das arme Tröpfli!"", und: ""So ein kleines Hilfloses da droben lassen!"", und dann wieder und wieder: ""Das arme Tröpfli!"" Die Dete lief, so schnell sie konnte, weiter und war froh, als sie nichts mehr hörte, denn es war ihr nicht wohl bei der Sache; ihre Mutter hatte ihr beim Sterben das Kind noch übergeben. Aber sie sagte sich zur Beruhigung, sie könne dann ja eher wieder etwas für das Kind tun, wenn sie nun viel Geld verdiene, und so war sie sehr froh, dass sie bald weit von allen Leuten, die ihr dreinredeten, weg- und zu einem schönen Verdienst kommen konnte.","But she became so overtempered because the women on all sides shouted at her: ""How can you do such a thing!"", and: ""The poor droplet!"", and: ""Leave such a helpless little one up there!"", and then again and again: ""The poor droplet!"" Dete ran on as fast as she could and was glad when she heard nothing more, for she didn't feel good about it; her mother had given her the child when she died. But she said to calm herself that she would be better able to do something for the child again if she now earned a lot of money, and so she was very glad that she would soon be far away from all the people who talked to her, and to a good earnings could come.","She became much provoked because the women called to her from every side: ""How could you do it?"" ""The poor little creature!"" ""The idea of leaving such a helpless child up there!"" and, over and over again: ""The poor little dear!"" Deta ran as quickly as she could and was glad when she heard no more calls, because, to tell the truth, she herself was uneasy. Her mother had asked her on her deathbed to care for Heidi. But she consoled herself with the thought that she would be able to do more for the child if she could earn some money. She was very glad to go away from people who interfered in her affairs, and looked forward with great delight to her new place. * * *","It made her uneasy to hear the women call back to her, from all sides, ‘How could you do it, Detie!’ ‘ Poor little mite!’ ‘ Fancy leaving that helpless little creature up there with that man!’ Detie was thankful when she was out of earshot. She did not want to think about what she had done, for when her mother was dying, she had made Detie promise to look after the child. She comforted herself with the thought that she would be better able to do so if she took this job where she could earn good money, and hurried away as fast as she could from all those people who would try to make her change her mind. 2","Good-bye to you then, and to you too, Heidi,"" she called, as she turned quickly away and started to descend the mountain at a running pace, which she did not slacken till she found herself safely again at Doerfli. * * * CHAPTER II A NEW HOME WITH GRANDFATHER"

Sebastian went straight to work and kept giggling to himself, because he thought: ""That'll sell something!"", and Sebastian didn't mind seeing Miss Rottenmeier getting a little excited.","The butler promised to look after the new-comers and prepared a bed for them in a basket. A long time afterwards, when it was time to go to bed, Miss Rottenmeier cautiously opened the door.","‘I’ll see to that for you, Miss Clara,’ he said obligingly. ‘I’ll make a cosy bed for them in a basket and put it where the old lady is not likely to look. You can rely on me.’ He went off to do as he had promised, chuckling to himself.","""I will see to that,"" answered Sebastian willingly. ""I will make a bed in a basket and put it in some place where the lady is not likely to go; you leave it to me."" He set about the work at once, sniggling to himself the while, for he guessed there would be a further rumpus about this some day, and Sebastian was not without a certain pleasure in the thought of Miss Rottermeyer being a little disturbed."

"Der Junge war schon eingetreten, und nach Anweisung fing er sofort seine Orgel zu drehen an. Fräulein Rottenmeier hatte, um dem Abc auszuweichen, sich im Esszimmer allerlei zu schaffen gemacht. Auf einmal horchte sie auf.--Kamen die Töne von der Straße her? Aber so nahe? Wie konnte vom Studierzimmer her eine Drehorgel ertönen? Und dennoch--wahrhaftig--sie stürzte durch das lange Esszimmer und riss die Tür auf. Da--unglaublich--da stand mitten im Studierzimmer ein zerlumpter Orgelspieler und drehte sein Instrument mit größter Emsigkeit. Der Herr Kandidat schien immerfort etwas sagen zu wollen, aber es wurde nichts vernommen. Klara und Heidi hörten mit ganz erfreuten Gesichtern der Musik zu.","The boy had already entered, and as instructed he immediately began to turn his organ. In order to avoid the ABC, Fraulein Rottenmeier had been busy with all sorts of things in the dining room. Suddenly she listened. Did the sounds come from the street? But that close? How could a barrel organ sound from the study? And yet--truly--she rushed across the long dining room and yanked open the door. There--unbelievable--there stood a ragged organ player in the middle of the study, turning his instrument with the greatest industriousness. The candidate seemed to want to say something all the time, but nothing was heard. Klara and Heidi listened to the music with very happy faces.","But the boy was already inside, and started to play. Miss Rottenmeier was in the adjoining room when she heard the sounds. Where did they come from? Hurrying into the study, she saw the street-boy playing to the eager children.","The boy was in fact already in the room and began to turn the handle of his organ. Miss Rottenmeier had gone to the dining‐room to avoid having to listen to a child learning the alphabet. Suddenly she pricked up her ears. Was that noise coming from the street? It sounded nearer but – there could never be a hurdy‐gurdy in the study! She ran to the door and there beheld the ragged street urchin calmly playing his organ. The tutor looked as though he wanted to say something, but couldn’t make up his mind to, while Clara and Heidi were listening to the music with obvious pleasure.","The boy was already inside the room, and according to Sebastian's directions immediately began to play his organ. Miss Rottermeyer hearing the music rushed into the room and saw the ragged boy turning away at his organ in the most energetic manner."
"""Wo bist du schon wieder, Heidi?"", rief er jetzt mit ziemlich grimmiger Stimme.","""Where are you again, Heidi?"" he called out in a rather grim voice.","""Heidi, where are you now?"" he called quite angrily.","‘Where have you got to now, Heidi?’ he called once rather crossly.","Peter had therefore to be on the alert, and his round eyes, which did not move very quickly, had more work than they could well manage, for the goats were as lively as Heidi; they ran in all directions, and Peter had to follow whistling and calling and swinging his stick to get all the runaways together again."
"Fräulein Rottenmeier fühlte sich beruhigter und entließ den Herrn Kandidaten zu seiner Arbeit. Am späteren Nachmittag stieg ihr die Erinnerung an Heidis Aufzug bei seiner vorgehabten Abreise auf, und sie beschloss, die Gewandung des Kindes durch verschiedene Kleidungsstücke der Klara in den nötigen Stand zu setzen, bevor Herr Sesemann erscheinen würde. Sie teilte ihre Gedanken darüber an Klara mit, und da diese mit allem einverstanden war und dem Heidi eine Menge Kleider und Tücher und Hüte schenken wollte, verfügte sich die Dame in Heidis Zimmer, um seinen Kleiderschrank zu besehen und zu untersuchen, was da von dem Vorhandenen bleiben und was entfernt werden solle. Aber in wenig Minuten kam sie wieder zurück mit Gebärden des Abscheus. ""Was muss ich entdecken, Adelheid!"", rief sie aus. ""Es ist nie dagewesen! In deinem Kleiderschrank, einem Schrank für Kleider, Adelheid, im Fuß dieses Schrankes, was finde ich? Einen Haufen kleiner Brote! Brot, sage ich, Klara, im Kleiderschrank! Und einen solchen Haufen aufspeichern!""--""Tinette"", rief sie jetzt ins Esszimmer hinaus, ""schaffen Sie mir das alte Brot fort aus dem Schrank der Adelheid und den zerdrückten Strohhut auf dem Tisch!""","Fraulein Rottenmeier felt calmer and dismissed the gentleman candidate to his work. Later in the afternoon she remembered Heidi's dress when he was about to leave, and she decided to give the child's clothes the necessary state by adding a variety of Klara's clothes before Herr Sesemann would appear. She shared her thoughts with Klara, and since she agreed with everything and wanted to give Heidi lots of clothes, scarves and hats, the lady went to Heidi's room to look at his wardrobe and see what was in it remain and what should be removed. But in a few minutes she came back with gestures of disgust. ""What do I have to discover, Adelheid!"" she exclaimed. ""It has never been there! In your closet, a closet for clothes, Adelheid, at the foot of this closet, what do I find? A heap of small loaves of bread! Bread, I say, Klara, in the closet! And store up such a heap!""-- ""Tinette,"" she now called out into the dining room, ""get the stale bread out of Adelheid's cupboard and the crushed straw hat on the table!""","But the teacher had more serious troubles still, for Heidi had not even learned her A,B,C in all this time. Heidi was sorely in need of some clothes, so Clara had given her some. Miss Rottenmeier was just busy arranging the child's wardrobe, when she suddenly returned. ""Adelheid,"" she said contemptuously, ""what do I find? A big pile of bread in your wardrobe! I never heard the like. Yes, Clara, it is true."" Then, calling Tinette, she ordered her to take away the bread and the old straw hat she had found.","Miss Rottenmeier felt somehow satisfied by that and let him go to his pupils. Later in the day she remembered the strange garments Heidi had put on to go home in, and decided she ought to give her some of Clara’s outgrown clothes before Mr Sesemann came home. She spoke to Clara about it and she agreed at once that Heidi could have several of her dresses, hats, and other garments. So Miss Rottenmeier went off to Heidi’s room to look at her clothes and decide what was worth keeping and what should be thrown away. In a few minutes she returned, looking more put out than ever. ‘Adelheid’ she cried, ‘what do I find in your wardrobe? Can I believe my eyes? Just think of it, Clara, at the bottom of the cupboard – a cupboard meant for clothes, Adelheid – I found a great pile of stale dry rolls. Fancy hoarding food away like that!’ Then she raised her voice and called Tinette. ‘ Go to Miss Adelheid’s room,’ she told her, ‘and get rid of the rolls in the cupboard, and throw the old straw hat that’s on the table into the dustbin!’","She confided her intention to Clara, who was quite willing to give up any number of dresses and hats to Heidi; so the lady went upstairs to overhaul the child's belongings and see what was to be kept and what thrown away. She returned, however, in the course of a few minutes with an expression of horror upon her face. ""What is this, Adelaide, that I find in your wardrobe!"" she exclaimed. ""I never heard of any one doing such a thing before! In a cupboard meant for clothes, Adelaide, what do I see at the bottom but a heap of rolls! Will you believe it, Clara, bread in a wardrobe! a whole pile of bread!"" ""Tinette,"" she called, ""go upstairs and take away all those rolls out of Adelaide's cupboard and the old straw hat on the table."""
"""Und wie führt sich das Gespenst weiter auf, Fräulein Rottenmeier?"", fragte nun Herr Sesemann mit einem lustigen Ausdruck in den Mundwinkeln.","""And how does the ghost continue to behave, Fraulein Rottenmeier?"" Mr. Sesemann now asked with a funny expression in the corners of his mouth.","""What new tricks has the ghost played on you, Miss Rottenmeier?"" asked Mr. Sesemann with a twinkle in his eye.","‘And how has the “ghost” been behaving, Miss Rotten‐meier?’ he asked that lady with a smile.","""And how is the ghost getting on?"" he asked, turning to Miss Rottermeyer, with a twinkle of amusement in his eye."
"""Aber erst waschen und sauber sein, sonst lacht einen die Sonne aus, wenn sie so schön glänzt da droben und sieht, dass du schwarz bist; sieh, dort ist's für dich gerichtet."" Der Großvater zeigte auf einen großen Zuber voll Wasser, der vor der Tür in der Sonne stand. Heidi sprang hin und patschte und rieb, bis es ganz glänzend war. Unterdessen ging der Großvater in die Hütte hinein und rief dem Peter zu: ""Komm hierher, Geißengeneral, und bring deinen Habersack mit."" Verwundert folgte Peter dem Ruf und streckte sein Säcklein hin, in dem er sein mageres Mittagessen bei sich trug.","""But first wash and be clean, otherwise the sun will laugh at you when it shines so beautifully up there and sees that you are black; see, there it is made for you."" Grandfather pointed to a large tub full of water that was lying in the sun in front of the door. Heidi jumped up and patted and rubbed until it was all shiny. Meanwhile the grandfather went into the hut and called to Peter: ""Come here, general of the goats, and bring your sack with you."" Surprised, Peter followed the call and held out his little bag, in which he carried his meager lunch.","""Go now, and wash yourself first, for the sun will laugh at you if he sees how dirty you are. Everything is ready there for you,"" he added, pointing to a large tub of water that stood in the sun. Heidi did as she was told, and washed and rubbed herself till her cheeks were glowing. In the meanwhile the grandfather called to Peter to come into the hut and bring his bag along. The boy followed the old man, who commanded him to open the bag in which he carried his scanty dinner.","‘You must have a wash first, or the sun will laugh to see you look so black.’ He pointed to a tub full of water, standing in the sun beside the door, and Heidi went over to it at once and began to splash about. Uncle Alp went indoors, calling to Peter, ‘Come here, General of the goats, and bring your knapsack with you.’ Peter held out the little bag which contained his meagre lunch, and watched with big eyes as the old man put in a piece of bread and a piece of cheese, both twice as big as his own.","Nothing could have pleased Heidi better, and she jumped for joy in answer. The grandfather went inside the hut, calling to Peter to follow him and bring in his wallet. Peter obeyed with astonishment, and laid down the little bag which held his meagre dinner."
Auf der Weide,On the pasture,ON THE PASTURE,A Day with the Goats,"Heidi felt very happy next morning as she woke up in her new home and remembered all the many things that she had seen the day before and which she would see again that day, and above all she thought with delight of the dear goats."

"""Ich bin schon zu spät"", sagte Peter langsam und blieb, ohne sich zu rühren, auf demselben Fleck stehen, von dem aus er, beide Hände in die Taschen gesteckt, dem Schreckensausbruch der Base zugehört hatte.","""I'm already late,"" said Peter slowly and remained standing without moving on the same spot from which he had listened to the outburst of terror from the cousin, both hands in his pockets.","""I am late already,"" replied Peter, and stood without moving from the place where, with his hands in his trousers' pockets, he had witnessed the violent outbreak of Heidi's aunt.","‘I’m late as it is,’ said Peter.

"Jetzt wurde das alte Schloss inwendig umgedreht und die knarrende Tür geöffnet; ein alter Mann trat heraus und schaute erst verwundert, dann ziemlich erzürnt auf die Kinder und fuhr sie an: ""Was untersteht ihr euch, mich da herunterzuklingeln?

Denn wenn ich jetzt tue, was es will, und es merkt nachher, dass es doch besser gewesen wäre, ich hätte ihm seinen Willen nicht getan, dann weint es nachher und sagt: Hätte mir doch der liebe Gott nur nicht gegeben, wofür ich bat, es ist gar nicht so gut, wie ich gemeint habe.' Und während nun der liebe Gott auf dich niedersah, ob du ihm auch recht vertrautest und täglich zu ihm kommest und betest und immer zu ihm aufsehest, wenn dir etwas fehlt, da bist du weggelaufen ohne alles Vertrauen, hast nie mehr gebetet und hast den lieben Gott ganz vergessen. Aber siehst du, wenn einer es so macht und der liebe Gott hört seine Stimme gar nie mehr unter den Betenden, so vergisst er ihn auch und lässt ihn gehen, wohin er will. Wenn es ihm dabei aber schlecht geht und er jammert: 'Mir hilft aber auch gar niemand!', dann hat keiner Mitleiden mit ihm, sondern jeder sagt zu ihm: 'Du bist ja selbst vom lieben Gott weggelaufen, der dir helfen konnte!' Willst du's so haben, Heidi, oder willst du gleich wieder zum lieben Gott gehen und ihn um Verzeihung bitten, dass du so von ihm weggelaufen bist, und dann alle Tage zu ihm beten und ihm vertrauen, dass er alles gut für dich machen werde, so dass du auch wieder ein frohes Herz bekommen kannst?""","""Yes, that's not how it works, Heidi! You don't have to think that! You see, God is a good father for all of us, who always knows what's good for us when we don't know it at all. But when we do Now if we want something from him that isn't good for us, he doesn't give us that, but something much better if we keep praying to him really heartily, but don't run away and lose all trust in him you, what you now wanted to ask of him, that was not good for you at that moment; the good Lord has already heard you, he can listen to and overlook all people at once, you see, that is why he is the good Lord and not one A human being like you and I. And because he now knew what was good for you, he thought to himself: 'Yes, Heidi should have what she asks for, but only when it is good for her, and so on how happy it can be because if I do what it wants now and it realizes later that it was better after all If I hadn't done what he wanted, then he'll cry afterwards and say: If only God hadn't given me what I asked for, it's not as good as I thought it would be.' And while the dear Lord was looking down on you, whether you really trusted him and came to him every day and prayed and always looked up to him when something was wrong with you, you ran away without any trust, never prayed again and have the dear one Forgetting God completely. But you see, when someone does it like that and the dear Lord never hears his voice among those who pray, he also forgets him and lets him go where he wants. But if he and he are doing badly complains: 'But nobody helps me either!', then no one feels sorry for him, but everyone says to him: 'You ran away from the good Lord yourself, who could help you!' Do you want it that way, Heidi, or do you want to go straight back to God and ask his forgiveness for running away from him like that, and then pray to him every day and trust him that he will do everything well for you, so that you can have a happy heart again?""","""That is not the way, Heidi. You see, God in heaven is a good Father to all of us, who knows what we need better than we do. When something we ask for is not very good for us, He gives us something much better, if we confide in Him and do not lose confidence in His love. I am sure what you asked for was not very good for you just now; He has heard you, for He can hear the prayers of all the people in the world at the same time, because He is God Almighty and not a mortal like us. He heard your prayers and said to Himself: 'Yes, Heidi shall get what she is praying for in time.' Now, while God was looking down on you to hear your prayers, you lost confidence and went away from Him. If God does not hear your prayers any more, He will forget you also and let you go. Don't you want to go back to Him, Heidi, and ask His forgiveness? Pray to Him every day, and hope in Him, that He may bring cheer and happiness to you.""","‘It isn’t quite like that, Heidi. God is a loving Father to us all and knows what is good for us. If we ask for something it isn’t right for us to have, He won’t give it to us, but in His own good time, if we go on praying and trust in Him, He’ll find us something better. You can be sure it’s not that He didn’t hear your prayer, for He can listen to everybody at once. That’s part of the wonder of it. You must have asked for something He thought you ought not to have at present and probably said to himself, “Heidi’s prayer shall be answered but only at the right moment so that she will really be happy. If I answer it now perhaps later on she’ll wish she hadn’t asked for it, because things may not turn out as she expects.” He has been watching over you all this time – never doubt that – but you have stopped praying, and that showed you did not really believe in Him. If you go on like that, God will let you go your own way. Then if things go wrong and you complain that there’s no one to help you, you will really have only yourself to blame, because you will have turned your back on the one Person who could really help you. Do you want that to happen, Heidi, or will you go now at once and ask God to forgive you and help you to find more faith, to help you to go on praying every day, and to trust Him to make things come right for you in the end?’","""You are wrong, Heidi; you must not think of Him like that. God is a good father to us all, and knows better than we do what is good for us. He did not think what you have been praying for was good for you just now; but be sure He heard you, for He can hear and see every one at the same time, because He is a God and not a human being like you and me. While God is watching over you, and looking to see if you will trust Him and go on praying to Him every day, you run away and leave off saying your prayers, and forget all about Him. You would not like to grieve God, would you, Heidi, when He only wants to be kind to you? So will you not go and ask Him to forgive you, and continue to pray and to trust Him, for you may be sure that He will make everything right and happy for you, and then you will be glad and lighthearted again."""

Tell me now, you don't have to regret it.""","""How can you talk like that, Deta?"" replied Barbara in an offended tone. ""People do not gossip much in Prätiggan, and I always can keep things to myself, if I have to. You won't repent of having told me, I assure you!""","‘Go on, Detie, what do you take me for?’ protested Barbie, half offended. ‘We aren’t such gossips as all that in Prättigau, and anyway I’m quite capable of holding my tongue when I want to. Do tell me. I promise not to pass it on.’","""Very well then, I will tell you—but just wait a moment,"" said Dete, looking around for Heidi who had slipped away unnoticed."
"Das half. Zwei Tage darauf stand Herr Sesemann vor seiner Tür und schellte dergestalt an seiner Hausglocke, dass alles zusammenlief und einer den anderen anstarrte, denn man glaubte nicht anders, als nun lasse der Geist frecherweise noch vor Nacht seine boshaften Stücke aus. Sebastian guckte ganz behutsam durch einen halb geöffneten Laden von oben herunter; in dem Augenblick schellte es noch einmal so nachdrücklich, dass jeder unwillkürlich eine Menschenhand hinter dem tüchtigen Ruck vermutete. Sebastian hatte die Hand erkannt, stürzte durchs Zimmer, kopfüber die Treppe hinunter, kam aber unten wieder auf die Füße und riss die Haustür auf. Herr Sesemann grüßte kurz und stieg ohne weiteres nach dem Zimmer seiner Tochter hinauf. Klara empfing den Papa mit einem lauten Freudenruf, und als er sie so munter und völlig unverändert sah, glättete sich seine Stirn, die er vorher sehr zusammengezogen hatte, und immer mehr, als er nun von ihr selbst hörte, sie sei so wohl wie immer und sie sei so froh, dass er gekommen sei, dass es ihr jetzt ganz recht sei, dass ein Geist im Haus herumfahre, weil er doch daran schuld sei, dass der Papa heimkommen musste.","That helped. Two days later Herr Sesemann stood in front of his door and rang his house bell in such a way that everyone rushed together and everyone stared at each other, for one could not have believed otherwise than the spirit was now impudently letting out its spiteful bits before nightfall. Sebastian carefully looked down through a half-open shutter; at that moment the bell rang again so emphatically that everyone involuntarily suspected a human hand behind the powerful jerk. Sebastian recognized the hand, fell across the room, headlong down the stairs, but got back on his feet and yanked open the front door. Herr Sesemann said hello and went straight up to his daughter's room. Klara received Papa with a loud cry of joy, and when he saw her so cheerful and completely unchanged, his forehead, which he had previously contracted, smoothed out, and more and more when he heard from her that she was as well as ever and she was so glad that he had come, that she was fine with the fact that a ghost was circling the house, because it was his fault that Papa had to come home.","Another letter was despatched to Mr. Sesemann, telling him that the excitement might have serious effects on his daughter's delicate constitution, and mentioning several misfortunes that might probably happen if he did not relieve the household from this terror. This brought Mr. Sesemann. Going to his daughter's room after his arrival, he was overjoyed to see her as well as ever. Clara was also delighted to see her father.","Her plot was successful. Two days later Mr Sesemann stood at his front door, ringing the bell so vigorously that everyone jumped, thinking the ghost had started playing tricks by daylight. Sebastian peeped through one of the upstairs windows to see what was happening, and at that moment the bell rang again so loudly that there could be no real doubt that a human hand had pulled it. He realized that it was his master and rushed downstairs, almost falling head over heels in his haste. Mr Sesemann hardly noticed him, but went at once to Clara’s room. She welcomed him joyfully and he was greatly relieved to find her so cheerful and, to all appearances, much as usual. Clara assured him she was really no worse, and was so pleased to see him that she felt quite grateful to the ghost for bringing him home.","So Miss Rottermeyer wrote another letter to Mr. Sesemann, stating that these unaccountable things that were going on in the house had so affected his daughter's delicate constitution that the worst consequences might be expected. Epileptic fits and St. Vitus's dance often came on suddenly in cases like this, and Clara was liable to be attacked by either if the cause of the general alarm was not removed. The letter was successful, and two days later Mr. Sesemann arrived home. Clara greeted him with a cry of joy, and seeing her so lively and apparently as well as ever, his face cleared, and the frown of anxiety passed gradually away from it as he heard from his daughter's own lips that she had nothing the matter with her, and moreover was so delighted to see him that she was quite glad about the ghost, as it was the cause of bringing him home again."
"""Ich möchte nur wissen"", sagte die Barbel forschend, ""was der Alte auf dem Gewissen hat, dass er solche Augen macht und so mutterseelenallein da droben auf der Alm bleibt und sich fast nie blicken lässt.

Why are his eyes so fierce and why does he live up there all alone? Nobody ever sees him and we hear many strange things about him.

"""In einer Hinsicht könnte man dafür, in einer anderen dawider sein"", entgegnete der Herr Kandidat; ""_dafür_ spräche der Grund, dass, wenn nun Ihre ganze Aufmerksamkeit auf diesen Gegenstand gerichtet ist--""; die Rede konnte nicht beendigt werden. Der Deckel des Korbes saß nur lose darauf, und nun sprangen mit einem Mal ein, zwei drei und wieder zwei und immer noch mehr junge Kätzchen darunter hervor und ins Zimmer hinaus, und mit einer so unbegreiflichen Schnelligkeit fuhren sie überall herum, dass es war, als wäre das ganze Zimmer voll solcher Tierchen. Sie sprangen über die Stiefel des Herrn Kandidaten, bissen an seinen Beinkleidern, kletterten am Kleid von Fräulein Rottenmeier empor, krabbelten um ihre Füße herum, sprangen an Klaras Sessel hinauf, kratzten, krabbelten, miauten; es war ein arges Gewirre. Klara rief immerfort voller Entzücken: ""Oh, die niedlichen Tierchen! Die lustigen Sprünge! Sieh! Sieh! Heidi, hier, dort, sieh dieses!"" Heidi schoss ihnen vor Freude in alle Winkel nach. Der Herr Kandidat stand sehr verlegen am Tisch und zog bald den einen, bald den andern Fuß in die Höhe, um ihn dem unheimlichen Gekrabbel zu entziehen. Fräulein Rottenmeier saß erst sprachlos vor Entsetzen in ihrem Sessel, dann fing sie an aus Leibeskräften zu schreien: ""Tinette! Tinette! Sebastian! Sebastian!"", denn vom Sessel aufzustehen konnte sie unmöglich wagen, da konnten ja mit einem Mal alle die kleinen Scheusale an ihr emporspringen.","""In one respect one might be in favour, in another against,"" replied the Lord Candidate; ""_for_ would be the reason that if now your whole attention is upon this subject--""; the speech could not be finished. The lid of the basket only sat loosely on it, and now suddenly one, two, three, and again two and still more kittens jumped out from under it and out into the room, and with such incomprehensible rapidity they whirled all over the place that it was as if the whole room were full of such little animals. They jumped over the candidate's boots, bit at his trousers, climbed up Fraulein Rottenmeier's dress, crawled around her feet, jumped up on Klara's chair, scratched, crawled, meowed; it was a mess. Klara kept crying out in delight: ""Oh, the cute little animals! The funny jumps! Look! Look! Heidi, here, there, look at this one!"" Heidi shot them with joy in all corners. The candidate stood very embarrassed at the table and pulled up first one foot, then the other, in order to remove it from the uncanny crawling. Fräulein Rottenmeier first sat speechless with horror in her armchair, then she started screaming with all her might: ""Tinette! Tinette! Sebastian! Sebastian!"", because she couldn't possibly dare to get up from the armchair, all of a sudden all the little monsters could jump up on her.","""I am afraid that you will think of nothing else,"" the teacher began. Just then something in the basket, which had been only lightly fastened, moved, and one, two, three and still more little kittens jumped out, scampering around the room with the utmost speed. They bounded over the tutor's boots and bit his trousers; they climbed up on Miss Rottenmeier's dress and crawled around her feet. Mewing and running, they caused a frightful confusion. Clara called out in delight: ""Oh, look at the cunning creatures; look how they jump! Heidi, look at that one, and oh, see the one over there?"" Heidi followed them about, while the teacher shook them off. When the housekeeper had collected her wits after the great fright, she called for the servants. They soon arrived and stored the little kittens safely in the new bed.","‘I could cite good reasons both for and against such a course of action,’ he began pompously. ‘In its favour is the fact that so long as your attention is entirely engaged . . .’ He got no further. The lid of the basket was not properly fastened, and suddenly the room seemed to be swarming with kittens. They jumped out one after another and rushed madly about, some biting the tutor’s trousers and jumping over his feet, others climbing up Miss Rottenmeier’s skirt. One scrambled on to Clara’s chair, mewing and scratching as it came. The whole room was in an uproar, and Clara was delighted. ‘Oh, aren’t they pretty little things! Just look at them jumping about!’ she exclaimed to Heidi, who was chasing after them from one end of the room to the other. Mr Usher was standing by the table, trying vainly to shake the kittens off his legs. Miss Rottenmeier, disliking all cats as she did, only found her voice again after an interval, and then called loudly for Sebastian and Tinette. She was afraid that if she moved all the horrid little creatures would jump up at her.","""On some considerations I am for it, on others against it,"" he began in answer; ""for it, on the ground that if your whole attention is directed to the basket—"" but the speech remained unfinished. The cover of the basket was loose, and at this moment one, two, three, and then two more kittens came suddenly tumbling on to the floor and racing about the room in every direction. They jumped over the tutor's boots, climbed up Miss Rottermeyer's dress, rolled about her feet, sprang up on to Clara's couch, scratching, scrambling, and mewing. Clara kept on exclaiming, ""Oh, the dear little things! how pretty they are! Look, Heidi, at this one; look, look, at that one over there!"" And Heidi in her delight kept running after them first into one corner and then into the other. The tutor stood up by the table not knowing what to do. Miss Rottermeyer was unable at first to speak at all, so overcome was she with horror, and she did not dare rise from her chair for fear that all the dreadful little animals should jump upon her at once. At last she found voice to call loudly, ""Tinette! Tinette! Sebastian! Sebastian!"" They came in answer to her summons and gathered up the kittens; by degrees they got them all inside the basket again and then carried them off to put with the other two."
"""So geh hinunter, wenn wir denn einig sind"", sagte der Alte und folgte dem Kind auf dem Fuß nach. Dann ging er zum Kessel hin, schob den großen weg und drehte den kleinen heran, der an der Kette hing, setzte sich auf den hölzernen Dreifuß mit dem runden Sitz davor hin und blies ein helles Feuer an. Im Kessel fing es an zu sieden, und unten hielt der Alte an einer langen Eisengabel ein großes Stück Käse über das Feuer und drehte es hin und her, bis es auf allen Seiten goldgelb war. Heidi hatte mit gespannter Aufmerksamkeit zugesehen; jetzt musste ihm etwas Neues in den Sinn gekommen sein; auf einmal sprang es weg und an den Schrank und von da hin und her. Jetzt kam der Großvater mit einem Topf und dem Käsebraten an der Gabel zum Tisch heran; da lag schon das runde Brot darauf und zwei Teller und zwei Messer, alles schön geordnet, denn das Heidi hatte alles im Schrank gut wahrgenommen und wusste, dass man das alles nun gleich zum Essen brauchen werde.","""Go downstairs if we're agreed,"" said the old man and followed the child on his heels. Then he went to the cauldron, pushed away the big one and turned the small one that was hanging on the chain, sat down on the wooden tripod with the round seat in front of it and blew on a bright fire. The kettle began to boil, and below the old man held a large piece of cheese by a long iron fork over the fire and turned it this way and that until it was golden on all sides. Heidi had watched with rapt attention; something new must have occurred to him now; all at once it jumped away and to the cupboard and back and forth from there. Grandfather came up to the table with a pot and the roast cheese on his fork; there was already the round loaf on it, and two plates and two knives, all neatly arranged, because Heidi had noticed everything in the cupboard and knew that you would need it all right away for eating.","""Let's go down then, if we agree,"" said the old man, and followed close behind her. Going up to the fireplace, he pushed the big kettle aside and reached for a smaller one that was suspended on a chain. Then sitting down on a three-legged stool, he kindled a bright fire. When the kettle was boiling, the old man put a large piece of cheese on a long iron fork, and held it over the fire, turning it to and fro, till it was golden-brown on all sides. Heidi had watched him eagerly. Suddenly she ran to the cupboard. When her grandfather brought a pot and the toasted cheese to the table, he found it already nicely set with two plates and two knives and the bread in the middle. Heidi had seen the things in the cupboard and knew that they would be needed for the meal.","‘Well then, if we are agreed, let us go and see about a meal,’ and he followed Heidi down the ladder. He went to the stove, lifted the big pot off the chain and put a smaller one in its place, then sat himself down on a three‐legged stool and blew up the fire with the bellows till it was red and glowing. As the pot began to sing, he put a large piece of cheese on a toasting fork and moved it to and fro in front of the fire until it became golden yellow all over. At first Heidi just stood and watched with great interest, then she thought of something else and ran to the cupboard. When her grandfather brought the steaming pot and the toasted cheese to the table, he found it was laid with two plates, two knives, and the round loaf. Heidi had noticed these things in the cupboard and knew they would be needed for the meal.","""I think we had better go down and have something to eat first,"" said the grandfather. While the kettle was boiling the old man held a large piece of cheese on a long iron fork over the fire, turning it round and round till it was toasted a nice golden yellow color on each side. Heidi watched all that was going on with eager curiosity. Suddenly some new idea seemed to come into her head, for she turned and ran to the cupboard, and then began going busily backwards and forwards. Presently the grandfather got up and came to the table with a jug and the cheese, and there he saw it already tidily laid with the round loaf and two plates and two knives each in its right place."

"""Wir haben noch etwas vergessen, Großvater"", sagte es dann.","""We forgot something else, grandfather,"" she said.","Heidi looked thoughtfully at her fresh, new bed and said, ""Grandfather, we have forgotten something.""","Then she looked at her bed thoughtfully for a moment, and said, ‘We’ve forgotten something, Grandfather.’","""We have forgotten something now, Grandfather,"" she said after a short silence."
"Auf diesem schmalen Bergpfade stieg am hellen, sonnigen Junimorgen ein großes, kräftig aussehendes Mädchen dieses Berglandes hinan, ein Kind an der Hand führend, dessen Wangen so glühend waren, dass sie selbst die sonnverbrannte, völlig braune Haut des Kindes flammend rot durchleuchteten. Es war auch kein Wunder: Das Kind war trotz der heißen Junisonne so verpackt, als hätte es sich eines bitteren Frostes zu erwehren. Das kleine Mädchen mochte kaum fünf Jahre zählen; was aber seine natürliche Gestalt war, konnte man nicht ersehen, denn es hatte sichtlich zwei, wenn nicht drei Kleider übereinander angezogen und drüberhin ein großes, rotes Baumwolltuch um und um gebunden, so dass die kleine Person eine völlig formlose Figur darstellte, die, in zwei schwere, mit Nägeln beschlagene Bergschuhe gesteckt, sich heiß und mühsam den Berg hinaufarbeitete. Eine Stunde vom Tal aufwärts mochten die beiden gestiegen sein, als sie zu dem Weiler kamen, der auf halber Höhe der Alm liegt und 'im Dörfli' heißt. Hier wurden die Wandernden fast von jedem Hause aus angerufen, einmal vom Fenster, einmal von einer Haustür und einmal vom Wege her, denn das Mädchen war in seinem Heimatort angelangt. Es machte aber nirgends Halt, sondern erwiderte alle zugerufenen Grüße und Fragen im Vorbeigehen, ohne still zu stehen, bis es am Ende des Weilers bei dem letzten der zerstreuten Häuschen angelangt war. Hier rief es aus einer Tür: ""Wart einen Augenblick, Dete, ich komme mit, wenn du weiter hinaufgehst.""","On that narrow mountain path, on a bright, sunny June morning, a tall, strong-looking girl from this mountainous country was climbing, leading by the hand a child whose cheeks were so flushed that they even shone flaming red through the child's sunburned, thoroughly brown skin. It was also no wonder: despite the hot June sun, the child was wrapped up as if it had to fight off a bitter frost. The little girl was scarcely five years old; but what its natural shape was, one could not tell, for it had obviously put on two, if not three, clothes on top of each other and tied a large, red cotton cloth around it, so that the little person represented a completely shapeless figure, which, in two heavy mountaineering boots studded with nails, worked his way up the mountain with great effort. The two of them must have climbed an hour up from the valley when they came to the hamlet halfway up the mountain pasture and called 'im Dörfli'. Here the wanderers were called from almost every house, once from the window, once from a front door and once from the path, because the girl had arrived in her hometown. It never stopped, however, but answered all the greetings and questions that were called out in passing, without stopping, until it had reached the last of the scattered little houses at the end of the hamlet. Here someone called out of a door: ""Wait a moment, Dete, I'll come with you if you go further up.""","One bright sunny morning in June, a tall, vigorous maiden of the mountain region climbed up the narrow path, leading a little girl by the hand. The youngster's cheeks were in such a glow that it showed even through her sun-browned skin. Small wonder though! for in spite of the heat, the little one, who was scarcely five years old, was bundled up as if she had to brave a bitter frost. Her shape was difficult to distinguish, for she wore two dresses, if not three, and around her shoulders a large red cotton shawl. With her feet encased in heavy hob-nailed boots, this hot and shapeless little person toiled up the mountain. The pair had been climbing for about an hour when they reached a hamlet half-way up the great mountain named the Alm. This hamlet was called ""Im Dörfli"" or ""The Little Village. "" It was the elder girl's home town, and therefore she was greeted from nearly every house; people called to her from windows and doors, and very often from the road. But, answering questions and calls as she went by, the girl did not loiter on her way and only stood still when she reached the end of the hamlet. There a few cottages lay scattered about, from the furthest of which a voice called out to her through an open door: ""Deta, please wait one moment! I am coming with you, if you are going further up.""","One sunny June morning, a tall sturdy young woman was climbing up the path. She had a bundle in one hand and held a little girl about five years old by the other. The child’s sunburnt cheeks were flushed, which was not surprising, for though the sun was hot she was wrapped up as though it was mid‐winter. It was difficult to see what she was like for she was wearing two frocks, one on top of the other, and had a large red scarf wound round and round her as well. She looked like some shapeless bundle of clothing trudging uphill on a pair of hobnailed boots. After climbing for about an hour, they came to the little village of Dörfli, half way up the mountain. This was the woman’s old home, and people called to her from their houses all the way up the street. She did not say much in reply but went on her way without stopping until she reached the last house. There a voice from within hailed her. ‘ Half a minute, Detie,’ it said, ‘I’ll come with you, if you’re going any farther.’","On a bright June morning two figures—one a tall girl and the other a child—could be seen climbing a narrow mountain path that winds up from the pretty village of Mayenfeld, to the lofty heights of the Alm mountain. In spite of the hot June sun the child was clothed as if to keep off the bitterest frost. She did not look more than five years old, but what her natural figure was like would be hard to say, for she had on apparently two dresses, one above the other, and over these a thick red woolen shawl. Her small feet were shod in thick, nailed mountain-shoes. When the wayfarers came to the hamlet known as Doerfli, which is situated half-way up the mountain, they met with greetings from all sides, for the elder girl was now in her old home. As they were leaving the village, a voice called out: ""Wait a moment, Dete; if you are going on up the mountain, I will come along with you."""
"In Heidis Zimmer eingetreten, stellte der Doktor seinen Leuchter auf den Tisch, nahm Heidi auf den Arm, legte es in sein Bett hinein und deckte es sorgfältig zu. Dann setzte er sich auf den Sessel am Bett und wartete, bis Heidi ein wenig beruhigt war und nicht mehr an allen Gliedern bebte. Dann nahm er das Kind bei der Hand und sagte begütigend: ""So, nun ist alles in Ordnung, nun sag mir auch noch, wo wolltest du denn hin?""","Having entered Heidi's room, the doctor put his candlestick on the table, took Heidi in his arms, laid her on his bed and carefully covered her up. Then he sat down in the armchair by the bed and waited until Heidi had calmed down a little and wasn't trembling in all her limbs. Then he took the child by the hand and said soothingly: ""Well, everything is all right now, now tell me where did you want to go?""","When they had arrived in Heidi's room, the doctor put the little girl to bed, covering her up carefully. Drawing a chair near the couch, he waited till Heidi had calmed down and had stopped trembling. Then taking her hand in his, he said kindly: ""Now everything is all right again. Tell me where you wanted to go?""","You’re all right.’ When they reached her room, he set the light down on the table and lifted Heidi back into bed. He covered her up carefully, then sat down in a chair beside her and waited until she was more herself. Then he took her hand and said gently, ‘That’s better. Now tell me where you were going.’","On reaching Heidi's room the doctor put the candle down on the table, and taking Heidi up in his arms laid her on the bed and carefully covered her over. Then he sat down beside her and waited until she had grown quieter and no longer trembled so violently. He then took her hand and said in a kind, soothing voice, ""There, now you feel better, and now tell me where you were wanting to go to?"""
"""Komm, Heidi, komm"", rief ihm Klara entgegen. ""Sieh, was ich dir habe einpacken lassen, komm, freut's dich?""","""Come, Heidi, come,"" Klara called out to him. ""Look what I packed for you, come on, are you happy?""","""Heidi, look at the things I had packed for you. Do you like them?""","‘Come and look at the things I’ve had put in for you,’ Clara cried. ‘I hope you’ll like them.","""Oh Heidi,"" cried Clara, as she entered; ""see all the things I have had put in for you— aren't you pleased?"""
"""Der? Ja, das denk ich, dass er einmal mehr gehabt hat"", entgegnete eifrig die Dete; ""eins der schönsten Bauerngüter im Domleschg hat er gehabt. Er war der ältere Sohn und hatte nur noch einen Bruder, der war still und ordentlich. Aber der Ältere wollte nichts tun, als den Herrn spielen und im Lande herumfahren und mit bösem Volk zu tun haben, das niemand kannte. Den ganzen Hof hat er verspielt und verzecht, und wie es herauskam, da sind sein Vater und seine Mutter hintereinander gestorben vor lauter Gram, und der Bruder, der nun auch am Bettelstab war, ist vor Verdruss in die Welt hinaus, es weiß kein Mensch wohin, und der Öhi selber, als er nichts mehr hatte als einen bösen Namen, ist auch verschwunden. Erst wusste niemand wohin, dann vernahm man, er sei unter das Militär gegangen nach Neapel, und dann hörte man nichts mehr von ihm zwölf oder fünfzehn Jahre lang. Dann auf einmal erschien er wieder im Domleschg mit einem halb erwachsenen Buben und wollte diesen in der Verwandtschaft unterzubringen suchen. Aber es schlossen sich alle Türen vor ihm, und keiner wollte mehr etwas von ihm wissen. Das erbitterte ihn sehr; er sagte, ins Domleschg setze er keinen Fuß mehr, und dann kam er hierher ins Dörfli und lebte da mit dem Buben. Die Frau muss eine Bündnerin gewesen sein, die er dort unten getroffen und dann bald wieder verloren hatte. Er musste noch etwas Geld haben, denn er ließ den Buben, den Tobias, ein Handwerk erlernen, Zimmermann, und der war ein ordentlicher Mensch und wohlgelitten bei allen Leuten im Dörfli. Aber dem Alten traute keiner, man sagte auch, er sei von Neapel desertiert, es wäre ihm sonst schlimm gegangen, denn er habe einen erschlagen, natürlich nicht im Krieg, verstehst du, sondern beim Raufhandel. Wir anerkannten aber die Verwandtschaft, da meiner Mutter Großmutter mit seiner Großmutter Geschwisterkind gewesen war. So nannten wir ihn Öhi, und da wir fast mit allen Leuten im Dörfli wieder verwandt sind vom Vater her, so nannten ihn diese alle auch Öhi, und seit er dann auf die Alm hinaufgezogen war, hieß er eben nur noch der 'Alm-Öhi'.""","""He? Yes, I think he had it once more,"" Dete replied eagerly; ""He had one of the most beautiful farms in Domleschg. He was the elder son and only had one brother, who was quiet and tidy. But the elder didn't want to do anything but play the master and drive around the country and deal with bad people and when it came out, his father and mother died one after the other of sheer grief, and his brother, who was also a beggar, bursts out into the world with anger out, no one knows where to go, and Öhi himself, when he had nothing more than a bad name, also disappeared. At first no one knew where to go, then it was heard that he had joined the military in Naples, and then nobody heard anything more of him for twelve or fifteen years. Then all of a sudden he appeared again in Domleschg with a half-grown boy and wanted to try to find him a place with his relatives. But all doors were closed to him and no one wanted me you know something about him. This angered him greatly; he said he never set foot in Domleschg again, and then he came to Dörfli and lived there with the boy. The woman must have been a Bündner he met down there and then soon lost again. He must still have some money, because he had the boy, Tobias, learn a trade, carpenter, and he was a decent person and well liked by everyone in Dorfli. But nobody trusted the old man, they also said he had deserted from Naples, otherwise things would have been bad for him, because he had killed someone, of course not in the war, you understand, but in a scuffle. However, we recognized the relationship, since my mother's grandmother had been a sibling with his grandmother. So we called him Öhi, and since we are related to almost everyone in Dörfli from our father, they all called him Öhi, and since he moved up to the Alm, he was just called 'Alm-Öhi '.""","""Did he once have more?"" asked Barbara. ""I should say so. He was heir to a large farm in Domleschg. But setting up to play the fine gentleman, he soon lost everything with drink and play. His parents died with grief and he himself disappeared from these parts. After many years he came back with a half-grown boy, his son, Tobias, that was his name, became a carpenter and turned out to be a quiet, steady fellow. Many strange rumors went round about the uncle and I think that was why he left Domleschg for Dörfli. We acknowledged relationship, my mother's grandmother being a cousin of his. We called him uncle, and because we are related on my father's side to nearly all the people in the hamlet they too all called him uncle. He was named 'Alm-Uncle' when he moved up to the Alm.""","asked Barbie. ‘I should just think he was. Why, he had one of the best farms in Domleschg. He was the elder son, with one brother, a quiet respectable fellow. But old Uncle wanted nothing but to ape the gentry and travel about all over the place. He got into bad company, and drank and gambled away the whole property. His poor parents died, literally died, of shame and grief when they heard of it. His brother was ruined too, of course. He took himself off, dear knows where, and nobody ever heard of him again. Uncle disappeared too. He had nothing left but a bad name. No one knew where he’d gone to, but after a while it came out that he had joined the army and was in Naples. Then no more was heard of him for twelve or fifteen years.’ Detie was enjoying herself. ‘ Go on,’ Barbie cried breathlessly. ‘Well, one day he suddenly reappeared in Domleschg with a young son, and wanted some of his relations to look after the boy. But he found all doors closed against him. Nobody wanted to have anything to do with him.’ ‘Whew!’ came in a whistle from Barbie. ‘He was so angry he vowed he would never set foot in the place again. So he came to Dörfli and settled down there with the boy, who was called Tobias. People thought he must have met and married his wife down in the south. Apparently she died soon afterwards, though nothing is known for certain. He had saved a little money, enough to apprentice his boy to a carpenter. Tobias was a good sort and everyone in the village liked him – but no one trusted the old man! It was said that he had deserted from the army at Naples, so as to avoid some trouble about killing a man – not in battle, you understand, but in a brawl. All the same we accepted him as a member of the family. His grandmother and my mother’s grandmother were sisters, so we called him Uncle, and as we’re related to almost everyone in Dörfli, one way or another, the whole village soon called him Uncle too. Then, when he went to live right up there on the mountain, it became Uncle Alp.’","Did he ever have anything more than his two goats and his hut?"" ""I should think so indeed,"" replied Dete with animation; ""he was at one time the owner of one of the largest farms in Domleschg, where my mother used to live. But he drank and gambled away the whole of his property, and when this became known to his mother and father they died of sorrow, one shortly after the other. Uncle, having nothing left to him but his bad name, disappeared and it was heard that he had gone to Naples as a soldier. After twelve or fifteen years he reappeared in Domleschg, bringing with him a young son whom he tried to place with some of his kinspeople. Every door, however, was shut in his face, for no one wished to have any more to do with him. Embittered by this treatment, he vowed never to set foot in Domleschg again, and he then came to Doerfli where he lived with his little boy. His wife, it seemed, had died shortly after the child's birth. He must have accumulated some money during his absence, for he apprenticed his son Tobias to a carpenter. He was a steady lad, and kindly received by every one in Doerfli. His father, however, was still looked upon with suspicion, and it was even rumored that he had killed a man in some brawl at Naples."" ""But why does everyone call him Uncle?"
"Heidi lief vom Dörfli bergan, so schnell es nur konnte; von Zeit zu Zeit musste es aber plötzlich stille stehen, denn es hatte ganz den Atem verloren; sein Korb am Arm war doch ziemlich schwer, und dazu ging es nun immer steiler, je höher hinauf es ging. Heidi hatte nur noch einen Gedanken: ""Wird auch die Großmutter noch auf ihrem Plätzchen sitzen am Spinnrad in der Ecke, ist sie auch nicht gestorben unterdessen?"" Jetzt erblickte Heidi die Hütte oben in der Vertiefung an der Alm, sein Herz fing an zu klopfen, Heidi rannte noch mehr, immer mehr und immer lauter schlug ihm das Herz. Jetzt war es oben--vor Zittern konnte es fast die Tür nicht aufmachen-- doch jetzt--es sprang hinein bis mitten in die kleine Stube und stand da, völlig außer Atem, und brachte keinen Ton hervor.","Heidi ran uphill from Dörfli as fast as she could; but from time to time it suddenly had to stand still, for it had completely lost its breath; his basket on his arm was pretty heavy, and the higher the climb, the steeper it got. Heidi only had one thought: ""Will the grandmother still be sitting in her place at the spinning wheel in the corner, hasn't she died in the meantime?"" Now Heidi saw the hut up in the hollow at the Alm, his heart started pounding, Heidi ran even more, his heart was beating faster and louder. Now it was upstairs - it could hardly open the door for trembling - but now - it jumped right into the middle of the little room and stood there, completely out of breath, and made no sound.","Heidi, in the meantime, was running up the path; from time to time she was obliged to stop, for her basket was heavy and she lost her breath. Her one idea was: "" If only grandmother still sits in her corner by her spinning wheel!—Oh, if she should have died!"" When the child caught sight of the hut at last, her heart began to beat. The quicker she ran, the more it beat, but at last she tremblingly opened the door. She ran into the middle of the room, unable to utter one tone, she was so out of breath.","As soon as she got away from the people, Heidi rushed uphill as fast as she could go. She had to stop every now and then to get her breath, for her basket was heavy and the mountain slope steep, but she had only one thought: ‘Will Grannie still be sitting in the corner by her spinning‐wheel? Oh, I hope she hasn’t died.’ Then she saw the little house in the hollow, and her heart beat faster than ever. She raced up to the door but could hardly open it, she was trembling so much, but she managed it, and flew into the little room quite out of breath and unable to say a word.","She climbed up the steep path from Doerfli as quickly as she could; she was obliged, however, to pause now and again to take breath, for the basket she carried was rather heavy, and the way got steeper as she drew nearer the top. One thought alone filled Heidi's mind, ""Would she find the grandmother sitting in her usual corner by the spinning-wheel, was she still alive? "" At last Heidi caught sight of the grandmother's house in the hollow of the mountain and her heart began to beat; she ran faster and faster and her heart beat louder and louder— and now she had reached the house, but she trembled so she could hardly open the door—and then she was standing inside, unable in her breathlessness to utter a sound."
"Und sie nannte ihm eine ganze Menge von Dingen, Kleider und Schürzen, Tücher und Nähgerät, ""und sieh hier, Heidi"", und Klara hob triumphierend einen Korb in die Höhe. Heidi guckte hinein und sprang hoch auf vor Freude, denn drinnen lagen wohl zwölf schöne, weiße, runde Brötchen, alle für die Großmutter. Die Kinder vergaßen in ihrem Jubel ganz, dass nun der Augenblick komme, da sie sich trennen mussten, und als mit einem Mal der Ruf erschallte: ""Der Wagen ist bereit!""--da war keine Zeit mehr zum Traurigwerden. Heidi lief in sein Zimmer, da musste noch ein schönes Buch von der Großmama liegen, niemand konnte es eingepackt haben, denn es lag unter dem Kopfkissen, weil Heidi Tag und Nacht sich nicht davon trennen konnte. Das wurde in den Korb auf die Brötchen gelegt. Dann machte es seinen Schrank auf; noch suchte es nach einem Gute, das man vielleicht auch nicht eingepackt hatte. Richtig--auch das alte rote Tuch lag noch da, Fräulein Rottenmeier hatte es zu gering erachtet, um mit eingepackt zu werden. Heidi wickelte es um einen anderen Gegenstand und legte es zuoberst auf den Korb, so dass das rote Paket sehr sichtbar zur Erscheinung kam. Dann setzte es sein schönes Hütchen auf und verließ sein Zimmer.","And she named him a whole lot of things, clothes and aprons, shawls and sewing utensils, ""and look here, Heidi,"" and Klara triumphantly lifted a basket in the air. Heidi looked inside and jumped up with joy because inside were probably twelve beautiful, white, round rolls, all for grandmother. In their jubilation, the children forgot that the moment was coming when they had to part, and when suddenly the call rang out: ""The carriage is ready!""--there was no more time for sadness. Heidi ran to her room, there must still be a nice book from grandma, nobody could have packed it because it was under the pillow because Heidi couldn't part with it day or night. That was put in the basket on the buns. Then it opened its closet; it was still looking for something good that perhaps it hadn't packed. That's right--the old red cloth was still there, Fraulein Rottenmeier had thought it too small to be packed with it. Heidi wrapped it around another item and placed it on top of the basket so that the red package was very visible. Then she put on her pretty little hat and left her room.","Clara asked. There were a great many lovely things in it, but Heidi jumped for joy when she discovered a little basket with twelve round white rolls for the grandmother. The children had forgotten that the moment for parting had come, when the carriage was announced. Heidi had to get all her own treasures from her room yet. The grandmama's book was carefully packed, and the red shawl that Miss Rottenmeier had purposely left behind. Then putting on her pretty hat, she left her room to say good-bye to Clara.","Look, there are frocks and aprons and hankies and some sewing things. Oh, and this!’ Clara held up a basket. Heidi peeped and jumped for joy, for inside were twelve beautiful rolls for Grannie. In their delight the children quite forgot that they were so soon to part, and when they heard someone call, ‘The carriage is here,’ there was no time to be sad. Heidi ran to the room which had been hers, to fetch the book which Grandmamma had given her. She always kept it under her pillow, for she could never bear to be parted from it, so she felt sure no one would have packed it. She put it in the basket. Then she looked in the cupboard and fetched out her precious old hat. Her red scarf was there too, for Miss Rottenmeier had not thought it worth putting in the trunk. Heidi wrapped it round her other treasure and put it on top of the basket where it was very conspicuous. Then she put on a pretty little hat which she had been given, and left the room.","And she ran over a list of things, dresses and aprons and handkerchiefs, and all kinds of working materials. "" And look here,"" she added, as she triumphantly held up a basket. Heidi peeped in and jumped for joy, for inside it were twelve beautiful round white rolls, all for grandmother. In their delight the children forgot that the time had come for them to separate, and when some one called out, ""The carriage is here,"" there was no time for grieving. Heidi ran to her room to fetch her darling book; she knew no one could have packed that, as it lay under her pillow, for she had kept it by her night and day. This was put in the basket with the rolls. Then she opened her wardrobe to look for another treasure—the old red shawl which had been left behind. Heidi wrapped it round her old hat and laid it on the top of the basket, so that the red package was quite conspicuous. Then she put on her pretty hat and left the room."

"Die beiden Kinder mussten sich schnell Lebewohl sagen, denn Herr Sesemann stand schon da, um Heidi nach dem Wagen zu bringen. Fräulein Rottenmeier stand oben an der Treppe, um hier Heidi zu verabschieden. Als sie das seltsame rote Bündelchen erblickte, nahm sie es schnell aus dem Korb heraus und warf es auf den Boden.","The two children had to say goodbye quickly, because Herr Sesemann was already there to take Heidi to the wagon. Fraulein Rottenmeier stood at the top of the stairs to say goodbye to Heidi. Seeing the strange little red bundle, she quickly took it out of the basket and threw it on the ground.","There was not much time left to do so, for Mr. Sesemann was waiting to put Heidi in the carriage. When Miss Rottenmeier, who was standing on the stairs to bid farewell to her pupil, saw the red bundle in Heidi's hand, she seized it and threw it on the ground.","She and Clara had to say goodbye quickly, for Mr Sesemann was waiting to put Heidi in the carriage, and Miss Rottenmeier was standing at the top of the stairs to say goodbye too.

"Nun beschrieb Heidi den Berg mit dem großen Schneefeld, auf dem der ganze Schnee im Feuer gestanden hatte und dann rosenrot geworden war und dann auf einmal ganz bleich und erloschen dastand.","Now Heidi described the mountain with the big snowfield, on which all the snow had been in the fire and then turned rose-red and then suddenly stood there quite pale and dead.",Heidi described several and the old man could name them all.,he asked.,"Then Heidi told him of the mountain with the great snowfield, and how it had been on fire."
"Das war dem Heidi eben recht. Nun fuhr es in alle Winkel hinein und schaute jedes Plätzchen aus, wo am schönsten zu schlafen wäre. In der Ecke vorüber des Großvaters Lagerstätte war eine kleine Leiter aufgerichtet; Heidi kletterte hinauf und langte auf dem Heuboden an. Da lag ein frischer, duftender Heuhaufen oben, und durch eine runde Luke sah man weit ins Tal hinab.","That was fine with Heidi. Now it drove into all corners and looked for every little spot where it would be nicest to sleep. In the corner past grandfather's bed a small ladder was erected; Heidi climbed up and reached the hayloft. There was a fresh, fragrant haystack up there, and through a round hatch you could see far down into the valley.","That suited Heidi exactly. She peeped into all the corners of the room and looked at every little nook to find a cosy place to sleep. Beside the old man's bed she saw a ladder. Climbing up, she arrived at a hayloft, which was filled with fresh and fragrant hay. Through a tiny round window she could look far down into the valley.","This answer pleased Heidi, and as she was looking round the room for a good place she noticed a ladder propped against the wall near her grandfather’s bed. She climbed up it at once and found herself in a hay loft. A pile of fresh, sweet‐smelling hay lay there, and there was a round hole in the wall of the loft, through which she could see right down the valley.","Heidi was delighted, and began at once to examine all the nooks and corners to find out where it would be pleasantest to sleep. In the corner near her grandfather's bed she saw a short ladder against the wall; up she climbed and found herself in the hay-loft.

"""So, so, wie ist das gemeint?"", fragte der Alte barsch, gab dem Kinde kurz die Hand und schaute es mit einem langen, durchdringenden Blick an, unter seinen buschigen Augenbrauen hervor. Heidi gab den langen Blick ausdauernd zurück, ohne nur einmal mit den Augen zu zwinkern, denn der Großvater mit dem langen Bart und den dichten, grauen Augenbrauen, die in der Mitte zusammengewachsen waren und aussahen wie eine Art Gesträuch, war so verwunderlich anzusehen, dass Heidi ihn recht betrachten musste. Unterdessen war auch die Base herangekommen samt dem Peter, der eine Weile stille stand und zusah, was sich da ereigne.","""So, so, how do you mean that?"" the old man asked harshly, gave the child his hand briefly and gave him a long, penetrating look from under his bushy eyebrows. Heidi returned the long look without even blinking, because the grandfather with the long beard and the thick, gray eyebrows, which had grown together in the middle and looked like a kind of bush, was so surprising to look at that Heidi had to look at him properly. In the meantime, the cousin had come along, along with Peter, who stood still for a while and watched what was happening.","""Well, well, what does that mean?"" replied the old man in a rough voice. Giving her his hand for only a moment, he watched her with a long and penetrating look from under his bushy brows. Heidi gazed back at him with an unwinking glance and examined him with much curiosity, for he was strange to look at, with his thick, grey beard and shaggy eyebrows, that met in the middle like a thicket. Heidi's aunt had arrived in the meantime with Peter, who was eager to see what was going to happen.","‘Hey, what’s that?’ he exclaimed gruffly, staring searchingly at her as he took her hand. She stared back, fascinated by the strange‐looking old man, with his long beard and bushy grey eyebrows. Meanwhile Detie came towards them, while Peter stood watching to see what would happen.","""So, so, what is the meaning of this?"" he asked gruffly, as he gave the child an abrupt shake of the hand, and gazed at her from under his bushy eyebrows. Heidi stared steadily back at him in return with unflinching gaze. Meanwhile Dete had come up, with Peter after her."
"Unterdessen war der Herr Kandidat angekommen; aber Fräulein Rottenmeier führte ihn nicht, wie gewöhnlich, ins Studierzimmer, denn sie musste sich erst aussprechen und geleitete ihn zu diesem Zweck ins Esszimmer, wo sie sich vor ihn hinsetzte und ihm in großer Aufregung ihre bedrängte Lage schilderte und wie sie in diese hineingekommen war.","Meanwhile the gentleman candidate had arrived; but Fraulein Rottenmeier did not take him into the study as usual, for she first had to talk things out and for that purpose took him into the dining room, where she sat down in front of him and, in great excitement, described her difficult situation to him and how she got into it .","The tutor had arrived in the meantime, but he was not asked to go to the study as usual.","While they talked the tutor arrived, but instead of coming straight to the study as usual, he was waylaid by Miss Rottenmeier who took him into the dining‐room to explain the awkward situation in which she found herself.","Meanwhile her tutor had arrived; Miss Rottermeyer, however, did not bring him straight into the study but drew him first aside into the dining-room, where she poured forth her troubles."

"Peter schaute das Heidi mit sprachloser Verwunderung an, denn noch nie in seinem Leben hätte er so sagen und etwas weggeben können. Er zögerte noch ein wenig, denn er konnte nicht recht glauben, dass es dem Heidi ernst sei; aber dieses hielt erst fest seine Stücke hin, und da Peter nicht zugriff, legte sie es ihm aufs Knie. Nun sah er, dass es ernst gemeint sei; er erfasste sein Geschenk, nickte in Dank und Zustimmung und hielt nun ein so reichliches Mittagsmahl wie noch nie in seinem Leben als Geißbub. Heidi schaute derweilen nach den Geißen aus. ""Wie heißen sie alle, Peter?"", fragte es.","Peter looked at Heidi with speechless amazement, because he had never been able to say something like that and give something away in his life. He hesitated a little longer, for he could not really believe that Heidi was serious; but this first held out its pieces firmly, and since Peter did not take hold of it, she laid it on his knee. Now he saw that it was meant seriously; he took hold of his present, nodded his thanks and approval, and now had a midday meal as rich as he had never had in his life as a kid. Meanwhile, Heidi kept an eye out for the goats. ""What's their name, Peter?"" it asked.","Peter was speechless with surprise, for it would have been impossible for him ever to give up any of his share. Not taking Heidi in earnest, he hesitated till she put the things on his knees. Then he saw she really meant it, and he seized his prize. Nodding his thanks to her, he ate the most luxurious meal he had ever had in all his life. Heidi was watching the goats in the meantime, and asked Peter for their names.","He looked at her with amazement for he had never in his life had any food to give away. At first he hesitated, thinking she must be joking, but she went on holding it out to him and finally put it on his knee. This convinced him that she really meant what she said, so he took it, nodded his thanks and settled down to enjoy the feast. Heidi meanwhile sat watching the goats. ‘What are they all called, Peter?’ she asked presently.","Peter looked at Heidi, unable to speak for astonishment. He hesitated a moment, for he could not believe that Heidi was in earnest; but the latter kept on holding out the bread and cheese, and as Peter still did not take it, she laid it down on his knees. He saw then that she really meant it; he seized the food, nodded his thanks and acceptance of her present, and then made a more splendid meal than he had known ever since he was a goat-herd. Heidi the while still continued to watch the goats. ""Tell me all their names,"" she said."
'Kreuz und Elende,'Cross and misery,"When Heidi had repeated the end of the song a number of times, the old woman exclaimed: ""Oh, Heidi, everything seems bright to me again and my heart is light.","And at the end she said, ‘Read it again, Heidi.","The grandmother sat with folded hands and a look of indescribable joy on her face, such as Heidi had never seen there before, although at the same time the tears were running down her cheeks."

"Jetzt hörte Heidi über sich ein lautes, scharfes Geschrei und Krächzen ertönen, und wie es aufschaute, kreiste über ihm ein so großer Vogel, wie es nie in seinem Leben gesehen hatte, mit weit ausgebreiteten Schwingen in der Luft umher, und in großen Bogen kehrte er immer wieder zurück und krächzte laut und durchdringend über Heidis Kopf.","Now Heidi heard a loud, sharp shriek and croaking above her, and when she looked up, a bird as large as she had ever seen in her life circled the air with wide-spread wings and swept in great arcs he kept coming back and croaked loudly and piercingly over Heidi's head.","Suddenly she heard a loud, sharp scream, and looking up she beheld the largest bird she had ever seen, flying above her.

Looking up, she saw an enormous bird, circling overhead with outstretched wings and croaking harshly as it flew.","Suddenly she heard a loud, harsh cry overhead and lifting her eyes she saw a bird, larger than any she had ever seen before, with great, spreading wings, wheeling round in wide circles, and uttering a piercing, croaking kind of sound above her."

"Das war Heidis Wunsch: Es sprang hinüber. Mitten in Klaras Zimmer war ein ungeheurer Koffer zu sehen, noch stand dessen Deckel weit offen.","That was Heidi's wish: it jumped over. In the middle of Klara's room an enormous suitcase could be seen, its lid still standing wide open.","Heidi had been wishing to go, and now she ran to Clara's room, where a huge trunk was standing.","He turned to Heidi. ‘Now go to Clara, my child, and stay with her until the carriage arrives.’ That was just what Heidi wanted to do, and she found Clara with a big trunk open beside her.","Heidi had been longing for this, and ran quickly upstairs.

"""Wart nur, das kommt schon, ich kann nicht alles auf einmal sagen"", erklärte Dete. ""Also der Tobias war in der Lehre draußen in Mels, und sowie er fertig war, kam er heim ins Dörfli und nahm meine Schwester zur Frau, die Adelheid, denn sie hatten sich schon immer gern gehabt, und auch wie sie nun verheiratet waren, konnten sie's sehr gut zusammen. Aber es ging nicht lange. Schon zwei Jahre nachher, wie er an einem Hausbau mithalf, fiel ein Balken auf ihn herunter und schlug ihn tot. Und wie man den Mann so entstellt nach Hause brachte, da fiel die Adelheid vor Schrecken und Leid in ein heftiges Fieber und konnte sich nicht mehr erholen, sie war sonst nicht sehr kräftig und hatte manchmal so eigene Zustände gehabt, dass man nicht recht wusste, schlief sie oder war sie wach. Nur ein paar Wochen, nachdem der Tobias tot war, begrub man auch die Adelheid. Da sprachen alle Leute weit und breit von dem traurigen Schicksal der beiden, und leise und laut sagten sie, das sei die Strafe, die der Öhi verdient habe für sein gottloses Leben, und ihm selbst wurde es gesagt und auch der Herr Pfarrer redete ihm ins Gewissen, er sollte doch jetzt Buße tun, aber er wurde nur immer grimmiger und verstockter und redete mit niemandem mehr, es ging ihm auch jeder aus dem Wege. Auf einmal hieß es, der Öhi sei auf die Alm hinaufgezogen und komme gar nicht mehr herunter, und seither ist er dort und lebt mit Gott und Menschen im Unfrieden. Das kleine Kind der Adelheid nahmen wir zu uns, die Mutter und ich; es war ein Jahr alt. Wie nun im letzten Sommer die Mutter starb und ich im Bad drunten etwas verdienen wollte, nahm ich es mit und gab es der alten Ursel oben im Pfäfferserdorf in die Kost. Ich konnte auch im Winter im Bad bleiben, es gab allerhand Arbeit, weil ich zu nähen und flicken verstehe, und früh im Frühling kam die Herrschaft aus Frankfurt wieder, die ich voriges Jahr bedient hatte und die mich mitnehmen will; übermorgen reisen wir ab, und der Dienst ist gut, das kann ich dir sagen.""","""Just wait, that's coming, I can't say everything at once,"" explained Dete. ""Well, Tobias was doing his apprenticeship outside in Mels, and as soon as he was finished, he came home to Dörfli and took my sister, Adelheid, to wife, because they had always liked each other, and now that they were married, They did it very well together. But it didn't last long. Just two years later, while he was helping to build a house, a beam fell down on him and killed him she fell into a severe fever from terror and suffering and could not recover, otherwise she was not very strong and had sometimes had such peculiar conditions that one did not quite know whether she was sleeping or awake.Just a few weeks after Tobias When they were dead Adelheid was also buried.Then all the people spoke far and wide about the sad fate of the two of them, and loudly and quietly they said that this was the punishment that Öhi had deserved for his godless life, and he himself received it said and also The pastor urged him to do penance, but he only became more and more angry and stubborn and didn't talk to anyone anymore, and everyone avoided him. Suddenly it was said that the Öhi had moved up to the alpine pasture and can't come down anymore, and since then he has been there and lives in strife with God and people. We took Adelheid's little child with us, the mother and I; it was a year old. When my mother died last summer and I wanted to earn something downstairs in the pool, I took it with me and fed it to old Ursel up in Pfäfferserdorf. I was able to stay in the pool in the winter too, there was all sorts of work because I know how to sew and mend, and early in the spring the gentlemen from Frankfurt came back, whom I had worked on last year and who want to take me with them; we leave the day after tomorrow and the service is good, I can tell you that.""","How can I tell you everything at once? "" exclaimed Deta. "" Tobias was an apprentice in Mels, and when he was made master, he came home to the village and married my sister Adelheid. They always had been fond of each other and they lived very happily as man and wife. But their joy was short. Two years afterwards, when Tobias was helping to build a house, a beam fell on him and killed him. Adelheid was thrown into a violent fever with grief and fright, and never recovered from it. She had never been strong and had often suffered from queer spells, when we did not know whether she was awake or asleep. Only a few weeks after Tobias's death they buried poor Adelheid. ""People said that heaven had punished the uncle for his misdeeds. After the death of his son he never spoke to a living soul. Suddenly he moved up to the Alp, to live there at enmity with God and man. ""My mother and I took Adelheid's little year-old baby, Heidi, to live with us. When I went to Ragatz I took her with me; but in the spring the family whose work I had done last year came from Frankfurt and resolved to take me to their town-house. I am very glad to get such a good position.""","‘Give me a chance! I was just coming to that,’ Detie snapped at her. ‘Tobias was apprenticed to a carpenter in Mels, but as soon as he had learnt his trade, he came home to Dörfli and married my sister Adelheid. They had always been fond of each other. They settled down very happily together as man and wife, but that didn’t last long. Only two years later he was killed by a falling beam while he was helping to build a house. Poor Adelheid got such a shock when she saw him carried home like that, that she fell ill with a fever, and never walked again. She had not been very strong before and used to have queer turns when it was hard to tell whether she was asleep or awake. She only survived him by a few weeks. That set tongues wagging of course. People said it was Uncle’s punishment for his mis‐spent life. They told him so to his face, and the pastor told him he ought to do penance to clear his conscience. That made him more angry than ever, and morose too. He wouldn’t speak to anyone after the pastor’s visit, and his neighbours began to keep out of his way. Then one day we heard that he’d gone to live up on the mountain and wasn’t coming down any more. He’s actually stayed up there from that day to this, at odds with God and man, as they say. My mother and I took Adelheid’s baby girl to live with us. She was only about a year old when she was left an orphan. Then, when mother died last summer I wanted to get a job in the town, so I took Heidi up to Pfäffersdorf and asked old Ursula to look after her. I managed to get work in the town right through the winter, as I’m handy with my needle and there was always someone who wanted sewing or mending done. Then early this year that family from Frankfurt came again, the people I waited on last year, and now, as I told you, they want me to go back with them, and they’re leaving the day after tomorrow. It’s a first‐rate job, I can tell you.’","""Our grandmothers were related, so we used to call him Uncle, and as my father had family connections with so many people in Doerfli, soon everyone fell into the habit of calling him Uncle,"" explained Dete. ""And what happened to Tobias,"" further questioned Barbel, who was listening with deep interest. ""Tobias was taught his trade in Mels, and when he had served his apprenticeship he came back to Doerfli and married my sister Adelaide. But their happiness did not last long. Two years after their marriage Tobias was killed in an accident. His wife was so overcome with grief that she fell into a fever from which she never recovered. She had always been rather delicate and subject to curious attacks, during which no one knew whether she was awake or sleeping. And so two months after Tobias had been carried to the grave, his wife followed him. Their sad fate was the talk of everybody far and near, and the general opinion was expressed that it was a punishment which Uncle deserved for the godless life he had led. Our minister endeavored to awaken his conscience, but the old man grew only more wrathful and stubborn and would not speak to a soul. All at once we heard that he had gone to live up on the Alm mountain and that he did not intend to come down again. Since then he has led his solitary life up there, and everyone knows him now by the name of Alm-Uncle. Mother and I took Adelaide's little one, then only a year old, into our care. When mother died last year, and I went down to the Baths to earn some money, I paid old Ursel to take care of her."
"""So komm und zeige mir sie.""","""So come and show me them.""","""Then come and show me.""","‘Well, come and show me.’","""Come then and show it me."""
"Während dieser Erklärungen waren die Herren die Treppe hinuntergestiegen und traten in dasselbe Zimmer ein, wo Johann und Sebastian auch gewacht hatten. Auf dem Tische standen einige Flaschen schönen Weines, denn eine kleine Stärkung von Zeit zu Zeit konnte nicht unerwünscht sein, wenn die Nacht da zugebracht werden musste. Daneben lagen die beiden Revolver, und zwei, ein helles Licht verbreitende Armleuchter standen mitten auf dem Tisch, denn so im Halbdunkel wollte Herr Sesemann das Gespenst denn doch nicht erwarten.","During these explanations the gentlemen had descended the stairs and entered the same room where Johann and Sebastian had also kept watch. A few bottles of fine wine stood on the table, for a little refreshment from time to time could not be unwelcome if the night had to be spent there. Next to them lay the two revolvers, and two candelabras that shed a bright light stood in the middle of the table, because Herr Sesemann didn't want to wait for the ghost in such semi-darkness.",With these explanations they entered the room where the two servants had watched before. A few bottles of wine stood on the table and two bright candelabra shed a brilliant light. Two revolvers were ready for emergencies.,"While he was talking, Mr Sesemann led the way to the same room where John and Sebastian had spent the night. On the table were the two guns and a bottle of wine, for if they had to sit up all night, a little refreshment would certainly be welcome. The room was lit by two candelabra, each holding three candles.","The two took up their quarters for the night in the same room in which Sebastian and John had kept watch. The door was shut close to prevent the light being seen in the hall outside, which might frighten away the ghost."
"""Wo ist die Großmutter?"", rief Heidi wieder.","""Where's the grandmother?"" Heidi called again.","""Where is her grandmother?"" ""She hasn't any.""",‘Where’s her grandmother then?’ ‘Hasn’t got one.’,"""Where is the grandmother?"" called Heidi again."
"Heidi konnte noch lange nicht aus seinem Schluchzen herauskommen; aber es verstand Klaras Trost und hielt sich daran, sonst hätte es gar nicht mehr zu weinen aufhören können. Es musste auch noch mehrere Male seiner Hoffnung gewiss werden und Klara, durch die letzten Anfälle von Schluchzen unterbrochen, fragen: ""Gibst du mir so viele, viele, wie ich hatte, für die Großmutter?""","Heidi could not get over her sobs for a long time; but it understood Klara's consolation and stuck to it, otherwise it would never have been able to stop crying. It also had to be certain of its hope several times and ask Klara, interrupted by the last fits of sobbing: ""Will you give me as many, many as I had for grandmother?""","Only after a long, long time did Heidi become quiet. When she had heard Clara's promise, she cried: ""Are you really going to give me as many as I had?""","It was a long time before Heidi could stop, but she understood what Clara was promising and was comforted at last, though she still wanted to be assured that Clara meant it. ‘Will you really give me as many rolls as I had saved?’ she asked in a still tearful voice.","She could not get over her sobs for a long time; she would never have been able to leave off crying at all if it had not been for Clara's promise that she should have fresh, new rolls to take to grandmother when the time came for her to go home."
"Jetzt trat der Großvater aus der Hütte, schaute noch einmal rings um sich und sagte dann mit zufriedenem Ton: ""So, nun können wir gehen.""","Grandfather now stepped out of the hut, looked around once more and then said in a satisfied tone: ""Well, we can go now.""","It was Saturday, and the grandfather had been cleaning the cottage.",Presently he came out of the hut and took a last look round.,"The grandfather came out, gave a look round, and then called to her in a cheerful voice, ""Well, now we can be off."""

Who came in?""","""Oh God,"" it sounded from one corner, ""our Heidi used to come in like that. Oh, if I just could have her again with me before I die. Who has come?"" ""Here I am!","‘Goodness me,’ someone said from the corner of the room, ‘that was how Heidi used to come in! How I wish she would come and see me again. Who is it?’","""Ah, my God!"" cried a voice from the corner, ""that was how Heidi used to run in; if only I could have her with me once again! Who is there?"""
"Denn es war Sonnabend heut, und an dem Tage machte der Alm-Öhi alles sauber und in Ordnung in der Hütte, im Stall und ringsherum, das war seine Gewohnheit, und heut hatte er den Morgen dazu genommen, um gleich nachmittags mit Heidi ausziehen zu können, und so sah nun alles ringsherum gut und zu seiner Zufriedenheit aus. Bei der Geißenpeter-Hütte trennten sie sich, und Heidi sprang hinein. Schon hatte die Großmutter seinen Schritt gehört und rief ihm liebevoll entgegen: ""Kommst du, Kind? Kommst du wieder?""","Because it was Saturday today, and that day Alm-Öhi cleaned and put everything in order in the hut, in the stable and around, that was his habit, and today he had taken the morning to move out with Heidi in the afternoon and so everything around now looked good and to his satisfaction.

Are you coming again?""","It was Saturday, and the grandfather had been cleaning the cottage. Soon he was ready to start.

He had worked hard all the morning so that he would be free to go with Heidi in the afternoon, and now everything looked spick and span so he could leave it with a clear conscience. ‘Now we can go,’ he said. They parted company outside the little house where Peter lived, and Heidi went in there. Grannie heard her step at once, and called affectionately, ‘Is that you, child?’ She took Heidi’s hand and held it tightly as if she was afraid of losing her again. ‘How did you like the rolls?’","It was Saturday, a day when Alm-Uncle made everything clean and tidy inside and outside the house; he had devoted the morning to this work so as to be able to accompany Heidi in the afternoon, and the whole place was now as spick and span as he liked to see it.
