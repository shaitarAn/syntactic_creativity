"Im Tore erschien ein Aufseher und klatschte in die Hände zum Zeichen, daß die Gepäckträger wieder an ihre Arbeit gehen sollten. Sie schütteten den Bodensatz aus ihren Kaffeetöpfen und zogen verstummend mit schwankenden Schritten ins Haus. „So kommen wir zu keinem Ende"", sagte der Polizeimann und wollte Karl am Arm fassen. Karl wich noch unwillkürlich ein wenig zurück, fühlte den freien Raum, der sich ihm infolge des Abmarsches der Gepäckträger eröffnet hatte, wandte sich um und setzte sich unter einigen großen Anfangs- sprüngen in Lauf. Die Kinder brachen in einen einzigen Schrei aus und liefen mit ausgestreckten Armchen paar Schritte mit. „Haltet ihn!"" rief der Polizeimann die lan- ge, fast leere Gasse hinab und lief unter gleichmäßigem Ausstoßen dieses Rufes in geräuschlosem große Kraf und Übung verratendem Lauf hinter Karl her. Es war ein Glück für Karl, daß die Verfolgung in einem Arbei- terviertel stattfand. Die Arbeiter halten es nicht mit den Behörden. Karl lief mitten in der Fahrbahn, weil er dort die wenigsten Hindernisse hatte, und sah nun hie und da auf dem Trottoirrand Arbeiter stehen bleiben und ihn ruhig beobachten, während der Polizeimann ihnen sein Haltet ihn!"" zurief und in seinem Lauf, er hielt sich kluger Weise auf dem glatten Trottoir, unauförlich den Stab gegen Karl hin ausstreckte. Karl hatte wenig Hoff- nung und verlor sie fast ganz, als der Polizeimann nun, da sie sich Quergassen näherten, die gewiß auch Polizei- patrouillen enthielten, geradezu betäubende Pfiffe aus- stieß. Karls Vorteil war lediglich seine leichte Kleidung, er flog oder besser stürzte die sich immer mehr senkende Straße herab, nur machte er zerstreut infolge seiner Ver- schlafenheit of zu hohe, zeitraubende und nutzlose Sprünge. Außerdem aber hatte der Polizeimann sein Ziel ohne nachdenken zu müssen, immer vor Augen, für Karl dagegen war der Lauf doch eigentlich Nebensache, er mußte nachdenken, unter verschiedenen Möglichkei- ten auswählen, immer neu sich entschließen. Sein etwas verzweifelter Plan war vorläufig die Quergassen zu ver- meiden, da man nicht wissen konnte was in ihnen steck- te, vielleicht würde er da geradeweg in eine Wachstube hineinlaufen; er wollte sich solange es nur gieng an diese weithin übersichtliche Straße halten, die erst tief unten in eine Brücke auslief, die kaum begonnen in Wasser- und Sonnendunst verschwand. Gerade wollte er sich nach diesem Entschluß zu schnellerem Lauf zusammen- nehmen, um die erste Quergasse besonders eilig zu pas- sieren, da sah er nicht allzuweit vor sich einen Polizei- mann lauernd an die dunkle Mauer eines im Schatten liegenden Hauses gedrückt, bereit im richtigen Augen- blick auf Karl loszuspringen. Jetzt blieb keine Hilfe, als die Quergasse und als er gar aus dieser Gasse ganz harm- los beim Namen gerufen wurde – es schien ihm zwar zuerst eine Täuschung zu sein, denn ein Sausen hatte er schon die ganze Zeit lang in den Ohren, zögerte er nicht mehr langer und bog, um die Polizeileute möglichst zu überraschen, auf einem Fuß sich schwenkend recht- winklig in diese Gasse ein.","A supervisor appeared at the gate and clapped his hands to signal that the porters should go back to their work. They poured the dregs out of their coffee pots and walked into the house without speaking, with unsteady steps. ""We won't get to the end like this,"" said the policeman and wanted to take Karl's arm. Karl involuntarily drew back a little, felt the free space that had opened up for him as a result of the porters marching off, turned around and sat down some great initial leaps. The children broke into a single cry and ran a few steps with outstretched arms. ""Hold him!"" shouted the policeman down the long, almost empty street and, uttering this call evenly, ran after Karl in a noiseless run that showed great strength and practice. It was lucky for Karl that the persecution took place in a working-class area. The workers disagree with the authorities. Karl ran in the middle of the road because he had the fewest obstacles there, and now he saw workers stopping here and there on the edge of the pavement and watching him calmly, while the policeman shouted at them his Hold him!"" and as he ran, he held himself cleverly on the slippery pavement, incessantly stretched out his baton at Karl. Karl had little hope and almost lost it completely when the policeman whistled downright deafeningly as they approached cross streets, which no doubt also contained police patrols Karl's only advantage was his light clothing, he flew, or better said, fell down the ever lowering street, only because of his drowsiness he often made too high, time-consuming and useless jumps having to think, always in mind, for Karl, on the other hand, the run was actually a secondary matter, he had to think, choose from various options, always n make up your mind. His somewhat desperate plan was to avoid the side streets for the time being, since one could not know what was in them, perhaps he would walk straight into a guard room there; He wanted to stick to this well-arranged road as long as he could, which only ended far below in a bridge that disappeared in the mist of water and sun as soon as he had started. After making this decision, he was just about to pull himself together to run faster, in order to hurry through the first cross street, when he saw a policeman not too far in front of him, lurking against the dark wall of a house lying in the shadows, ready in the jump at Karl at the right moment. Now there was no help when the cross street and when his name was called quite harmlessly from this street - it seemed to him to be a deception at first, because his ears had been ringing for the whole time, he hesitated no longer and, in order to surprise the policemen as much as possible, turned on one foot at right angles into this alley.","A supervisor appeared in the gateway and clapped his hands to indicate to the porters that it was time to get back to work. They tipped the coffee grounds out of their mugs, and with rolling strides and abating noise went back inside. ‘We’re not really getting anywhere like this,’ said the policeman, and reached out to take Karl’s arm. Karl instinctively drew back, sensed the space behind him that had been vacated by the porters, turned round, and with a few initial bounds, started running. The children all called out as one, and ran after him, for a few steps, stretching out their little hands. ‘Stop that man!’ the policeman shouted down the long, almost deserted road, and regularly repeating his cry, set off in pursuit of Karl, in a silent running style that indicated excellent condition and practice. It was as well for Karl that the chase took place in a working-class district The workers don’t side with the authorities. Karl ran down the middle of the road, where he had the fewest obstacles in his path, and from time to time he saw workers stopping on the edge of the pavement coolly watching him, while the policeman called out his ‘Stop that man!’ and stretched out his truncheon in Karl’s direction as he ran, wisely choosing the smooth pavement for his terrain. Karl had little hope, and almost abandoned that when the policeman, as they were approaching some cross-streets, that almost certainly had some police patrols in them, began emitting a piercing whistle. Karl’s only advantage was his light clothing, he flew or rather plunged down the middle of the street – the slope was getting steeper all the time – only, because of his sleepiness, he wasted his energy in very high, wasteful bounds that cost him time. But besides that, the policeman had his objective right in front of him, and didn’t need to think about it, whereas for Karl, the running was actually a secondary concern, he had to think, to choose between various possibilities, to keep making decisions. His rather desperate plan was to avoid the cross-streets for now, as he couldn’t know what they might contain, perhaps he might run straight into the purlieus of a police station; for as long as possible he wanted to stick to this street where he could see a long way down, until right at the bottom it debouched on to a bridge which had barely begun before disappearing into a haze of sun and water. In accordance with this decision, he was just gathering up his strength to pass the first cross-street at a sprint, when, not far ahead of him, he spied a policeman lurking, pressed flat against the dark wall of a house in shadow, all set to leap out at Karl at the right moment. Now there was nothing for it but the side-street, and when he heard his name being called out from there too, quite innocently – he thought at first it must be an illusion, because he had had a rushing in his ears for some time now, he didn’t hesitate and, trying to catch the police out if possible, he leaped off one foot and jinked at a right angle into the little street.","At the gate a supervisor appeared and clapped his hands to indicate that the porters should return to work. They poured out the grounds from their coffeepots and headed into the house with faltering steps. “If we go on like this, we’ll never get finished,” said the policeman, and he attempted to seize Karl by the arm. At first Karl shrank back a little involuntarily, but sensing the free space that had opened up for him now that the porters had marched off, he turned around and, after jumping up in the air several times, burst into a run. The children broke out in one great scream and for a couple of paces ran alongside him, arms outstretched. “Stop him!” the policeman shouted down the long and nearly empty street, and continuing to emit the same cry at regular intervals, he ran in a powerful silent stride, which showed that he was no novice. It was lucky for Karl that he was being chased through a workers’ district. Workers have no use for the authorities. Karl ran down the center of the road, for he met with fewer obstacles there, and occasionally saw workers halting here and there on the side of the road to observe him quietly as the policeman shouted, “Stop him!” and, sensibly remaining on the smooth road and keeping his truncheon pointed at Karl, charged ahead. Karl now had little hope and almost lost the remainder when the policeman began to let out nearly deafening whistles, for they were approaching side streets where there must also have been police on patrol. The only advantage Karl possessed was his light clothing; he flew or rather flung himself down the continuously sloping street, even though in his sleepy state he often leaped too high, which was useless and time consuming. Besides, the policeman always had his goal before him and never had to think, whereas for Karl the running itself was of secondary importance, for he had to consider everything, choose among various options, and then choose all over again. His rather desperate plan was to avoid the side streets for now, for it was impossible to know what might lurk there, and he could easily have run right into a police station; he wanted to stick as long as possible to this street, which had a clear view and much farther down led to a bridge that no sooner began than it vanished amid a haze of water and sun. Karl had scarcely taken that decision and was collecting himself so that he could run faster and cross the first intersecting street in one great dash when he saw lying in wait, not far off, pressed up in the shade against the dark wall of a house, a policeman all set to jump out at Karl at the first opportunity. The side street was now his only hope, so when someone in that street called out his name—though this seemed an illusion at first, for his ears were ringing the entire time— he no longer hesitated and, so as to catch the police by surprise, if possible, he swung about on one foot and turned into that street."
"„ich kenne ihn schon von früher her. Ich marschierte einmal einen Tag lang mit ihm und war froh, als ich nicht mehr bei ihm war. Und jetzt soll ich Diener bei ihm werden?""","""I know him from before. I once marched with him for a day and was glad when I wasn't with him anymore. And now I shall be his servant?""","‘Delamarche is a bad lot,’ said Karl, ‘I’ve had dealings with him before. Once I walked with him for a day, and I was glad when we parted company. And now I’m to be his servant?’","“Delamarche is a bad person,” said Karl, “I know him from before. I once spent an entire day on a long march with him and was glad not to be around him anymore. And I’m supposed to be a servant at his place?”"
"„Du wirst bei uns bleiben"", sagte Delamarche, ohne den Blick von der Straße zu wenden, und streckte nur eine Hand aus, um Karl am Weggehen zu verhindern.","""You will stay with us,"" said Delamarche, not taking his eyes off the road, only holding out a hand to stop Karl from leaving.","‘You’re saying with us,’ said Delamarche, without taking his eye off the street, merely extending a hand to prevent Karl from going.","“You’re staying with us,” said Delamarche, and without even taking his eyes off the street, he reached out his hand to prevent Karl from leaving."
"Jetzt muß ich aber wirklich auf jedes Wort achtgeben, sagte sich Karl und freute sich als er bei einem Seitwärts- schauen bemerkte, daß in die Figur des Heizers das Le- ben zurückzukehren begann.","But now I really have to pay attention to every word, Karl said to himself and was pleased when, looking sideways, he noticed that life was beginning to return to the figure of the stoker.","Now I really must pay attention to every word, Karl said to himself, and he was glad when he saw out of the corner of his eye that animation was beginning to return to the figure of the stoker.","“Now I’ll really have to pay attention to every word they say,” Karl said to himself, and he was pleased to see from a side glance that the stoker was beginning to show signs of life again."
"Statt dessen aber sagte die Oberköchin nach einer klei- nen Pause, die niemand zu unterbrechen gewagt hatte – nur die Uhr schlug in Bestätigung der Worte des Ober- kellners halb sieben und mit ihr, wie jeder wußte, gleich- zeitig alle Uhren im ganzen Hotel, es klang im Ohr und in der Ahnung wie das zweimalige Zucken einer einzi- gen großen Ungeduld: „Nein Karl nein, nein! Das wol- len wir uns nicht einreden. Gerechte Dinge haben auch ein besonderes Aussehn und das hat, ich muß es gestehn, Deine Sache nicht. Ich darf das sagen und muß es auch sagen, denn ich bin es, die mit dem besten Vorurteil für Dich hergekommen ist. Du siehst, auch Terese schweigt."" (Aber sie schwieg doch nicht, sie weinte.)","Instead, however, the head cook said, after a short pause, which no one had dared to interrupt - only the clock struck six-thirty in confirmation of the head waiter's words and with it, as everyone knew, all the clocks in the whole hotel simultaneously , it sounded in the ear and in the foreboding like the double twitching of a single great impatience: ""No, Karl, no, no! We don't want to tell ourselves that. Just things also have a special appearance and I have to admit that your business doesn't have that. I'm allowed to say that and I have to say it, because it's me who came here with the best prejudice for you. You see, Terese is also silent."" (But she wasn't silent, she was crying.)","Instead of which, after a short silence which no one dared to break – only the clock supplied confirmation of the Head Waiter’s words by striking the half hour, and at the same time, as everyone knew, all the other clocks in the whole hotel also struck, an audible and an imagined chime, like the twofold twitching of a single great impatience, the Head Cook said: ‘No, Karl, no, no! Don’t let’s get involved in all that. Just causes have a certain distinctive aspect, and yours, I must confess, doesn’t. I say so and I am bound to say so as I came here most predisposed in your favour. You see, even Therese is silent.’ (But she wasn’t silent at all, she was crying.)","Instead, however, after a brief pause that nobody had dared interrupt—except for the clock, which, confirming what the head waiter had said, struck half past six, accompanied, as everybody realized, by all the other clocks in the hotel; so that in one’s ear and in one’s imagination the sound seemed like the twofold twitching of one great disembodied impatience—the head cook said: “No, Karl, no, no! We’re not going to allow ourselves to accept that. Just causes have a quite distinctive appearance, whereas yours, I must admit, does not. I can say this and am indeed obliged to say so since I’m the one who was most favorably inclined toward you when I came in. Look, even Therese has fallen silent.” (But she had not fallen silent; she was weeping.)"
"Aber dann führte sie diese Drohung nicht aus – was sie ja auch an und für sich gar nicht imstande gewesen wäre – Delamarche schien sie aus Furcht sie könnte sich erkäl- ten, erfaßt und in die Wanne gedrückt zu haben, denn mächtig klatschte es ins Wasser.","But then she did not carry out this threat - which she would not have been able to do in and of herself - Delamarche seemed to have grabbed her, afraid she might catch a cold, and pushed her into the tub, because there was a mighty splash in the water .","But then she didn’t carry out her threat – which she wasn’t actually in a position to do anyway – because Delamarche, worried that she might catch cold, seemed to have seized her and pushed her down into the tub, because there was an almighty splash.","But she did not carry out this threat—which she would have been completely incapable of doing—and Delamarche, anxious lest she catch a cold, evidently caught her and pushed her into the tub, for there was a great splash."
"Sie forderte ihn auf aufzustehn, er antwortete nicht und rührte sich nicht. Sie entzündete irgendwo eine Ker- ze, das Zimmer bekam Licht, ein blaues Zickzackmuster erschien auf dem Plafond, aber Karl lag, den Kopf auf Sophapolster aufgestützt, so wie ihn Klara gebettet hat- te, und wendete ihn nicht einen Fingerbreit. Klara gieng im Zimmer herum, ihr Rock rauschte um ihre Beine, wahrscheinlich beim Fenster blieb sie eine lange Weile stehn. „Ausgetrotzt?"" hörte man sie dann fragen. Karl empfand es schwer, in diesem Zimmer, das ihm doch von Herrn Pollunder für diese Nacht zugedacht war, keine Ruhe bekommen zu können. Da wanderte dieses Mädchen herum, blieb stehn und redete und er hatte sie doch so unaussprechlich satt. Rasch schlafen und von hier fortgehn war sein einziger Wunsch. Er wollte gar nicht mehr ins Bett, sondern nur hier auf dem Kanapee bleiben. Er lauerte nur darauf daß sie weggienge, um hinter ihr her zur Tür zu springen, sie zu verriegeln und dann wieder zurück auf das Kanapee sich zu werfen. Er hatte ein solches Bedürfnis sich zu strecken und zu gäh- nen, aber vor Klara wollte er das nicht tun. Und so lag er, starrte hinauf, fühlte sein Gesicht immer unbewegli- cher werden und eine ihn umkreisende Fliege flimmerte ihm vor den Augen, ohne daß er recht wußte, was es war.","She asked him to get up, he didn't answer and didn't move. She lit a candle somewhere, the room got light, a blue zigzag pattern appeared on the ceiling, but Karl lay with his head propped on the sofa cushion, just as Klara had laid it, and didn't turn it an inch. Klara walked around the room, her skirt rustling around her legs, she probably stood by the window for a while. ""Hardly?"" she was then heard to ask. Karl found it difficult not to be able to get any rest in this room, which Mr. Pollunder had intended for him for the night. Then this girl wandered around, stopped and talked and he had she was so indescribably fed up. His only wish was to sleep quickly and leave here. He didn't want to go to bed any more, he just wanted to stay here on the sofa. He just waited for her to go away, so he could jump to the door after her. latching them and then throwing himself back onto the sofa. He had such a need to stretch and yawn, but he didn't want to do that in front of Klara. And so he lay, staring up, always feeling his face immobile - become cher and a fly circling him flickered before his eyes without his really knowing what it was.","She told him to get up, but he didn’t move or reply. Somewhere she lit a candle, and the room grew light, a blue zigzag pattern appeared on the ceiling, but Karl lay there, his head on the sofa cushion, just as Klara had left it, and didn’t move it an inch. Klara walked about the room, her skirt swishing against her legs, then she stopped for a long time, probably by the window, he guessed. ‘ Snapped out of it?’ she could be heard to ask. It was a heavy blow to Karl that in this room, where Mr Pollunder had put him for the night, he could get no rest. This girl was walking about in it, then she would stop and talk, it was all so inexpressibly tedious. He wanted to get to sleep quickly, and then get out of here, nothing more. He didn’t even want to go to bed, just stay where he was on the sofa. He was just lying there, waiting for her to leave, then he would leap across to the door, bolt it, and fling himself back on the sofa. He had such a need to stretch and yawn, but he didn’t want to do that in front of Klara. And so he lay there, staring up, feeling his face becoming ever more rigid, sensing a fly buzzing in front of his eyes, without really knowing what it was.","She demanded that he get up; he did not respond, nor did he move. Somewhere she lit a candle; the room lit up, a pattern of blue zigzag appeared on the ceiling, but Karl lay there quite motionless, his head leaning on the sofa cushion exactly where Klara had set it down, and he did not move it an inch. Klara walked about in the room, her skirt rustling around her legs, and then stood a long while, presumably by the window. “Had a good sulk?” one could hear her ask. Karl found it difficult to accept that he could find no peace in this room that Mr. Pollunder had after all set aside for him. That girl wandered about, then stopped and talked, and he was so indescribably sick of her. His only desire was to take a quick nap and get away. He no longer even wanted to go to bed, just to stay there on the settee. He was merely waiting for her to leave so that he could get up when she left, jump over to the door, bolt it, and then throw himself back down on the settee. He had such a strong urge to stretch out and yawn, though not in Klara’s presence. And thus he lay, staring up into the air and sensing his face become increasingly motionless; a fly circling about him swam before his eyes, although he could not quite tell what it was."
"„Diese Gefahr ist also vorläufig abgewehrt"", sagte sich Karl und kehrte zum Tisch zurück. Wenn ihre Schläfrig- keit nicht Vorwand war, war ja alles gut. Unangenehm war bloß, daß der eine ein Irländer war. Karl wußte nicht mehr genau, in was für einem Buch er einmal zu- hause gelesen hatte, daß man sich in Amerika vor den Irländern hüten solle. Während seines Aufenthaltes beim Onkel hätte er freilich die beste Gelegenheit ge- habt, der Frage nach der Gefährlichkeit der Irländer auf den Grund zu gehn, hatte dies aber, weil er sich für immer gut aufgehoben geglaubt hatte, völlig versäumt. Nun wollte er wenigstens mit der Kerze, die er wieder angezündet hatte, diesen Irländer genauer ansehn, wobei er fand, daß gerade dieser erträglicher aussah, als der Franzose. Er hatte sogar noch eine Spur von runden Wangen und lächelte im Schlaf ganz freundlich, soweit das Karl aus einiger Entfernung, auf den Fußspitzen ste- hend feststellen konnte.","""So this danger has been averted for the time being,"" Karl said to himself and returned to the table. If her sleepiness wasn't an excuse, everything was fine. The only unpleasant thing was that one of them was Irish. Karl couldn't remember exactly where what a book he had once read at home, that one should beware of the Irish in America.During his stay with his uncle he would have had the best opportunity to get to the bottom of the question of the dangers of the Irish , but had completely neglected this because he had believed himself to be in good hands forever. Now he wanted at least to take a closer look at this Irishman with the candle he had re-lit, although he found that this one in particular looked more tolerable than the Frenchman He even had a trace of round cheeks and smiled very friendly in his sleep, as far as Karl could tell from a distance, standing on tiptoe.","‘So that danger has been averted for the time being,’ Karl told himself, and went back to the table. Unless their sleepiness was feigned, all was well. Too bad that one of them had to be Irish. Karl couldn’t quite remember what book at home had warned him to beware of Irishmen in America. His stay with his uncle would have given him an excellent opportunity of going into the question of the dangers of Irishmen, but because he’d thought himself in security for good, he had neglected to do that. Now he at least wanted to take a closer look at the Irishman, with the candle that he had re-lit, and found that he looked if anything more palatable than the Frenchman. There was still a trace of roundness in his cheeks, and he had a friendly smile as he slept, as far as Karl could make out standing on tiptoe some way away.","“So the danger has been averted for now,” Karl said to himself, and returned to the table. If their sleepiness was not merely a pretense, everything would be fine. The only unpleasant thing about all this was that one was an Irishman. Karl could no longer quite recall in what book he had once read that one should be wary of Irishmen in America. Of course, that time at his uncle’s would have afforded him the best opportunity to resolve this question about the danger posed by the Irishmen, but he had utterly failed to seize it, believing that he would always be well situated. Now he at least wanted to take a closer look at the Irishman in the light of the candle, which he had relit, and in doing so he discovered that this man actually looked more tolerable than the Frenchman. There was still a trace of roundness in his cheeks, and he had a friendly smile on his face as he slept, insofar as Karl, standing on his tiptoes some distance away, could make out."
"„Danke für die Auskunf"", sagte der Polizeimann und salutierte vor Delamarche. „Jedenfalls werde ich ihn mitnehmen und dem Hotel occidental zurückgeben las- sen."" Aber Delamarche sagte: „Dürfe ich die Bitte stel- len, mir den Jungen vorläufig zu überlassen, ich hätte einiges mit ihm in Ordnung zu bringen. Ich verpflichte mich, ihn dann selbst ins Hotel zurückzuführen."" „Das kann ich nicht tun"", sagte der Polizeimann. Delamarche sagte: „Hier ist meine Visitkarte"" und reichte ihm ein Kärtchen. Der Polizeimann sah es anerkennend an, sagte aber verbindlich lächelnd: „Nein es ist vergeblich."" So sehr sich Karl bisher vor Delamarche gehütet hatte, jetzt sah er in ihm die einzig mögliche Rettung. Es war zwar verdächtig, wie sich dieser beim Polizeimann um Karl bewarb, aber jedenfalls würde sich Delamarche leichter als der Polizeimann bewegen lassen, ihn nicht ins Hotel zurückzuführen. Und selbst wenn Karl an der Hand des Delamarche ins Hotel zurückkam, so war es viel weniger schlimm, als wenn es in Begleitung des Poli- zeimannes geschah. Vorläufig aber durfe natürlich Karl nicht zu erkennen geben, daß er tatsächlich zu Dela- marche wollte, sonst war alles verdorben. Und unruhig sah er auf die Hand des Polizeimanns, die sich jeden Augenblick erheben konnte, um ihn zu fassen.","""Thanks for the information,"" said the policeman, and saluted Delamarche. ""Anyway, I'll take him with me and have him returned to the Hotel occidental."" But Delamarche said: 'May I ask that you leave the boy to me for the time being, I have some things to put right with him. I undertake to take him back to the hotel myself.' 'I can't do that,' said the policeman. Delamarche said, ""Here's my business card,"" and handed him a card. The policeman looked at it appreciatively, but said, smiling obligingly, ""No, it's useless."" As much as Karl had been wary of Delamarche, he now saw in him the only possible salvation. It was indeed suspicious how the latter applied to the policeman for Karl, but Delamarche would certainly be more persuaded than the policeman not to lead him back to the hotel. And even if Karl came back to the hotel holding Delamarche's hand, it was much less serious than if it happened in the company of the policeman. For the time being, however, Karl must not let it be known that he actually wanted to see Delamarche, otherwise everything would be spoiled. And he looked uneasily at the policeman's hand, which might rise at any moment to seize him.","‘Thank you for that information,’ said the policeman, saluting Delamarche. ‘I’m certainly taking him in now, and I’ll have him returned to the Hotel Occidental.’ But Delamarche said: ‘Might I ask you to leave the boy with me for the time being, I’ve got a couple of things to settle with him. I’ll undertake to deliver him to the hotel myself afterwards.’ ‘I’m afraid I can’t do that,’ said the policeman. ‘Here is my visiting card,’ said Delamarche, giving him a little card. The policeman looked at it appreciatively, but said, with a pleasant smile: ‘No, nothing doing.’ Though Karl had shown the utmost wariness of Delamarche hitherto, he now saw in him his only possible salvation. It was admittedly rather suspicious, the way he was pleading with the policeman to be given Karl, but it should finally prove easier to persuade Delamarche than the policeman not to take him back to the hotel. And even if Karl were delivered back to the hotel by Delamarche, that was still infinitely preferable to it happening under police escort. For now, Karl mustn’t let on that he preferred to be with Delamarche, that would ruin everything. And he looked nervously at the hand of the policeman which might be raised at any moment to apprehend him.","“Thanks for the information,” said the policeman, saluting Delamarche. “In any case I shall take him and make sure he’s brought back to the Occidental Hotel.” But Delamarche said: “May I ask that you leave the boy in my care for now, I’ve got a few things to sort out with him. I promise to take him back to the hotel myself.” “That I cannot do,” said the policeman. Delamarche said, “ Here’s my visiting card,” and handed him a small card. The policeman looked at it appreciatively but said with an engaging smile: “No, it’s pointless.” However wary of Delamarche Karl had been, he now saw him as his sole means of salvation. Though there was admittedly something rather suspect about the way in which he appealed to the policeman to let him take Karl, it would be easier to persuade Delamarche rather than the policeman not to escort him back to the hotel. And even if he had to go back to the hotel with Delamarche holding his arm, it would not be quite so bad as being taken there under police escort. But of course, Karl could not divulge that he did want to go to Delamarche’s, for in that case everything would be lost. And he gazed apprehensively at the policeman’s hand, which could at any moment jump up and seize him."
"„Seht einmal"", hörte er da die Stimme des Dela- marche. Alle drei standen im Zimmer, der Vorhang war hinter ihnen schon zugezogen, Karl mußte ihr Kommen überhört haben, die Hände sanken ihm bei dem Anblick von den Messern herab. Aber er hatte gar nicht Zeit, irgendein Wort zur Erklärung oder Entschuldigung zu sagen, denn in einem weit über die augenblickliche Gele- genheit hinausgehenden Wutanfall sprang Delamarche – sein gelöstes Schlafrockseil beschrieb eine große Figur in der Luf – auf Karl los. Karl wich noch im letzten Au- genblick dem Angriff aus, er hätte die Messer aus der Tür ziehen und zur Verteidigung benützen können, aber das tat er nicht, dagegen griff er sich bückend und auf- springend nach dem breiten Schlafrockkragen des Dela- marche, schlug ihn in die Höhe, zog ihn dann noch weiter hinauf – der Schlafrock war ja für Delamarche viel zu groß – und hielt nun glücklich den Delamarche beim Kopf, der allzusehr überrascht, zuerst blind mit den Händen fuchtelte und erst nach einem Weilchen, aber noch nicht mit ganzer Wirkung mit den Fäusten auf Karls Rücken schlug, der sich, um sein Gesicht zu schüt- zen, an die Brust des Delamarche geworfen hatte. Die Faustschläge ertrug Karl, wenn er sich auch vor Schmer- zen wand und wenn auch die Schläge immer stärker wurden, aber wie hatte er das nicht ertragen sollen, vor sich sah er ja den Sieg. Die Hände am Kopf des Dela- marche, die Daumen wohl gerade über seinen Augen führte er ihn vor sich her gegen das ärgste Möbeldurch- einander hin und versuchte überdies mit den Fußspitzen das Schlafrockseil um die Füße des Delamarche zu schlingen und ihn auch so zu Fall zu bringen.","""Look,"" he heard Delamarche's voice. All three were standing in the room, the curtain had already been drawn behind them, Karl must have not heard them coming, his hands dropped from his knives at the sight. But he had no time to utter a word of explanation or apology, for in a fit of rage far exceeding the present opportunity, Delamarche—his loosened dressing-gown rope made a great figure in the air—pounced on Karl.Karl swerved at the last leap - in the moment of the attack, he could have pulled the knives out of the door and used them for defense, but he didn't do that, instead, bending down and jumping up, he grabbed Delamarche's broad dressing-gown collar, knocked it up, then pulled him even further up - the dressing gown was much too big for Delamarche - and now happily held Delamarche by the head, who, all too surprised, first waved his hands blindly and only after e After a while, but not yet with full effect, he pounded his fists on Karl's back, who, to protect his face, had thrown himself on Delamarche's breast. Karl endured the punches, even though he was writhing in pain and the blows kept getting stronger, but how could he not have endured it, he saw victory ahead of him. With his hands on Delamarche's head, his thumbs probably just above his eyes, he led him in front of him towards the worst mess of furniture and, moreover, tried with the tips of his toes to loop the dressing-gown rope around Delamarche's feet and also to fall him bring to.","‘Will you look at that,’ he heard the voice of Delamarche saying. All three of them were in the room, the curtains had been drawn behind them already, Karl must have failed to hear them come in, and at the sight his hands let go of the knives. He had no time to offer a word of explanation or apology, because in a fit of rage that went far beyond the immediate situation, Delamarche – his loose dressing-gown cord describing a great arc in the air – flew at Karl. Karl was able to get out of the way of the attack at the last moment, he might have pulled the knives out of the door, but he didn’t, instead crouching and leaping up in the air, he snatched the broad collar of Delamarche’s dressing-gown, pulled it up and then pulled it higher – the dressing-gown was far too big for Delamarche after all – and now happily he had Delamarche’s head in his grip, who, completely taken by surprise, first groped about blindly with his hands, and after a little while but still not very effectively began to batter Karl’s back with his fists, who, to protect his face, had thrown himself at Delamarche’s chest. Karl could stand the buffeting, though he was squirming with pain, and the blows were getting stronger all the time, but then how could he not have done, he had victory in his sights. With his hands on Delamarche’s head, his thumbs probably directly over his eyes, he pulled him along in front of him into the worst of the furniture chaos, at the same time trying with his feet to loop the dressing cord round Delamarche’s ankles, and so bring him to a fall.","“Look,” he heard Delamarche’s voice saying. All three now stood in the room, having drawn the curtain behind them; Karl must not have heard them enter; at the sight his hands fell from the knives. But he had no time to say a word in explanation or apology, for in an outburst of rage far exceeding the present occasion, Delamarche—whose loose dressing-gown cord described a great figure in the air—jumped on Karl. At the last moment Karl evaded the attack; he could have pulled the knives from the door and used them to defend himself but did not do so; however, bending down a little and jumping up in the air, he reached out for the wide collar of Delamarche’s dressing gown, pulled it up, then dragged it even higher— Delamarche’s dressing gown was really much too big for him—and then fortunately Delamarche, taken by surprise, caught his head in his dressing gown, merely waved his hands blindly at first, and then, little by little, began to strike Karl on the back with his fist, and though this had little effect, it did force Karl to throw himself against Delamarche’s chest in order to protect his own face. However much he writhed with pain and however hard Delamarche’s fists bore down on him, Karl endured the blows, and how could he possibly have acted any differently, for he could already see victory ahead. Keeping his hands on Delamarche’s head and his thumbs probably just above his eyes, he pressed him up against the worst pile of furniture and at the same time tried to wind the cord of the dressing gown around Delamarche’s feet and thus trip him up."
"Karl las bei ihrem Licht: Geliebter Neffe! Wie Du während unseres leider viel zu kurzen Zusammenlebens schon erkannt haben wirst, bin ich durchaus ein Mann von Principien. Das ist nicht nur für meine Umgebung sondern auch für mich sehr unangenehm und traurig, aber ich verdanke meinen Principien alles was ich bin und niemand darf verlangen daß ich mich vom Erdbo- den wegleugne, niemand, auch Du nicht, mein geliebter Neffe, wenn auch Du gerade der erste in der Reihe wä- rest, wenn es mir einmal einfallen sollte, jenen allgemei- nen Angriff gegen mich zuzulassen. Dann würde ich am liebsten gerade Dich mit diesen beiden Händen mit de- nen ich das Papier halte und beschreibe, auffangen und hochheben. Da aber vorläufig gar nichts darauf hindeu- tet daß dies einmal geschehen könnte, muß ich Dich nach dem heutigen Vorfall unbedingt von mir fortschik- ken und ich bitte Dich dringend, mich weder selbst auf- zusuchen, noch brieflich oder durch Zwischenträger Verkehr mit mir zu suchen. Du hast Dich gegen meinen Willen dafür entschieden, heute Abend von mir fortzu- gehn, dann bleibe aber auch bei diesem Entschluß Dein Leben lang, nur dann war es ein männlicher Entschluß. Ich erwählte zum Überbringer dieser Nachricht Herrn Green, meinen besten Freund, der sicherlich für Dich genug schonende Worte finden wird, die mir im Augenblick tatsächlich nicht zur Verfügung stehn. Er ist ein einflußreicher Mann und wird Dich schon mir zu Liebe in Deinen ersten selbständigen Schritten mit Rat und Tat unterstützen. Um unsere Trennung zu begreifen, die mir jetzt am Schlüsse dieses Briefes wieder unfaßlich scheint, muß ich mir immer wieder neuerlich sagen: Von Deiner Familie, Karl, kommt nichts Gutes. Sollte Herr Green vergessen, Dir Deinen Koffer und Deinen Regenschirm auszuhändigen, so erinnere ihn daran. Mit besten Wün- schen für Dein weiteres Wohlergehn","Karl read by her light: Beloved nephew!

Then I would love to catch and lift you with these two hands, which I use to hold and write on the paper. But since there is currently nothing to suggest that this could ever happen, after today's incident I must absolutely send you away from me and I urge you not to visit me yourself, nor to communicate with me by letter or through intermediaries search. Against my will you have decided to leave me tonight, but then stick to this decision for the rest of your life, only then was it a male decision. I chose Mr. Green, my best friend, to be the bearer of this message. He is an influential man and, for my sake, will support you in word and deed as you take your first independent steps. In order to understand our separation, which now seems incomprehensible to me at the end of this letter, I have to repeat myself over and over again: Nothing good comes from your family, Karl.

Then I would love to take you with these same two hands that are holding and writing on this piece of paper, and lift you high up in the air.

He is a man of influence and, even if only for my sake, he will support you by word and deed as you take your first independent steps. In trying to understand our separation, which in concluding this letter I again find incomprehensible, I must tell myself over and over again: Karl, nothing good ever comes from your family.

"„Wer denn sonst?"" sagte Robinson. „Es war noch ein Hilfsarbeiter da, ein faules Luder, ich habe die meiste Arbeit allein machen müssen. Brunelda ist unten beim Wagen gestanden, Delamarche hat oben angeordnet, wohin die Sachen zu legen sind, und ich bin immerfort hin und hergelaufen. Es hat zwei Tage gedauert, sehr lange, nicht wahr? aber Du weißt ja gar nicht wie viel Sachen hier im Zimmer sind, alle Kästen sind voll und hinter den Kästen ist alles vollgestopf bis zur Decke hinauf. Wenn man ein paar Leute für den Transport auf- genommen hätte, wäre ja alles bald fertig gewesen, aber Brunelda wollte es niemandem außer mir anvertrauen. Das war ja sehr schön, aber ich habe damals meine Ge- sundheit für mein ganzes Leben verdorben und was ha- be ich denn sonst gehabt, als meine Gesundheit. Wenn ich mich nur ein wenig anstrenge sticht es mich hier und hier und hier. Glaubst Du, diese Jungen im Hotel, diese Grasfrösche – was sind sie denn sonst? – hätten mich jemals besiegen können, wenn ich gesund wäre. Aber was mir auch fehlen sollte, dem Delamarche und der Brunelda sage ich kein Wort, ich werde arbeiten, solange es gehn wird und bis es nicht mehr gehn wird, werde ich mich hinlegen und sterben und dann erst, zu spät, wer- den sie sehn, daß ich krank gewesen bin und trotzdem immerfort und immerfort weitergearbeitet und mich in ihren Diensten zu Tode gearbeitet habe. Ach Roß- mann"", sagte er schließlich und trocknete die Augen an Karls Hemdärmel. Nach einem Weilchen sagte er: „Ist Dir denn nicht kalt, Du stehst da so im Hemd."" „Geh Robinson"", sagte Karl, „immerfort weinst Du. Ich glaube nicht, daß Du so krank bist. Du siehst ganz gesund aus, aber weil Du immerfort da auf dem Balkon liegst, hast Du Dir so verschiedenes ausgedacht. Du hast vielleicht manchmal einen Stich in der Brust, das habe ich auch, das hat jeder. Wenn alle Menschen wegen jeder Kleinigkeit so weinen wollten, wie Du, müßten da die Leute auf allen Baikonen weinen.""","""Who else?"" said Robinson. ""There was another unskilled worker there, a lazy scoundrel, I had to do most of the work myself. Brunelda was standing downstairs by the wagon, Delamarche upstairs ordered where the things were to be put, and I kept walking back and forth. It took two days, a long time, didn't it? but you don't know how many things are in this room, all the boxes are full and behind the boxes everything is crammed up to the ceiling. If if a few people had been hired for the transport everything would have been ready soon, but Brunelda didn't want to confide in anyone but me. That was very nice, but I ruined my health for the rest of my life at the time and what ha ""I haven't had anything else but my health. If I try just a little bit it stings me here and here and here. Do you think those boys in the hotel, those common frogs - what else are they? - could ever have defeated me , if I would be healthy. But whatever I should be missing, I won't say a word to Delamarche and Brunelda, I'll work as long as it's possible and until it's no longer possible, I'll lie down and die and only then, too late, will they see that I've been ill and still worked on and on and worked myself to death in their service. Oh Rossmann,"" he finally said and dried his eyes on Karl's shirt sleeve. After a while he said: ""Aren't you cold, you're standing there in your shirt?"" ""Go Robinson,"" said Karl, ""you're crying all the time. I don't think you're that ill. You look quite healthy, but because you're always lying there on the balcony you've thought of so many different things. Perhaps you sometimes have I have a stitch in my chest too, everyone has it. If everyone wanted to cry like you because of every little thing, people on every balcony would have to cry.""","‘Who else?’ said Robinson. ‘There was a man to help me, a lazy beggar, I had to do most of it by myself. Brunelda stayed downstairs by the car, Delamarche gave the instructions upstairs, where to put things, and I kept going back and forth. It took two days, a long time, isn’t it? but you’ve no idea how many things are up here in the room , all the boxes are full and behind the boxes everything’s stacked up to the ceiling. If we’d taken on a couple of people to do the removal, it could all have been done very quickly, but Brunelda didn’t want to entrust it to anyone else but me. That’s very nice, but I ruined my health for the rest of my days doing it, and what else have I got but my health. If I exert myself even a tiny bit, I feel it here and here and here. Do you imagine those boys in the hotel, those bullfrogs – what else can you call them? – could ever have beaten me, if I’d been fit. But whatever’s the matter with me, I’ll never breathe a word to Delamarche and Brunelda, I’ll go on working for as long as I can until I’m completely incapacitated, and then I’ll lay myself down and die, and only then, too late, they’ll see I was sick and in spite of that went on and on working, and finally worked myself to death in their service. Oh Rossmann,’ he said finally, drying his eyes on Karl’s sleeve. After a little while he said: ‘Aren’t you cold, standing there in your shirt.’ ‘Come on, Robinson,’ said Karl, ‘you’re forever crying. I don’t think you’re that sick. You look pretty healthy to me, but because you always lie out on the balcony, you’ve been having thoughts. Maybe you do have an occasional pain in your chest, so do I, so does everyone. If everyone in the world would cry like that over every trifling thing, they’d all be crying on all the balconies.’","“Who else?” said Robinson. “There was a laborer too, but he was a lazy bum, and I had to do most of the work on my own. Brunelda was below by the car, Delamarche upstairs explaining where everything had to be put, and I was running up and down the entire time. It took two days—that’s a long time, isn’t it? But you’ve no idea how many things there are in that room, all the closets are full, and the rest is piled up to the ceiling behind the closets. If they’d hired a couple of people to transport all of that, it would all have been done quickly, but Brunelda wouldn’t entrust the task to anyone but me. Well, that was very nice, but now I’ve ruined my health for the rest of my life, and what did I have other than my health? If I exert myself ever so slightly, I get a pain there and here. If I were healthy, do you think those boys in the hotel, those grass toads— what else would one call them?—could possibly have defeated me. But no matter what’s wrong with me, I won’t breathe a word to Delamarche and Brunelda; I’ll work as long as possible, and until it’s not possible anymore, then I’ll lie down and die, and only then, when it’s too late, will they see that, though I was sick, I was still working, always working, and that I actually worked myself to death in their service. Oh Rossmann,” he concluded, drying his eyes on Karl’s shirtsleeves. After a short pause he said: “But don’t you feel cold, standing there in your shirt.” “Come, Robinson,” said Karl, “you’re continually crying. I don’t believe you’re so ill. You look completely healthy, but since you’re always lying out here on the balcony, you’ve just imagined all sorts of things. You may occasionally get a pain in your chest, but then so do I, so does everybody. If everybody cried over every little trifle as you do, then all those people up on all the balconies would be crying too.”"
"„Ja"", sagte Karl, „ich habe ja erst abend einen großen Streit mit ihnen gehabt. Ich muß da noch eine fürchter- liche Beule haben."" Und er tastete hinten seinen Kopf ab.","""Yes,"" said Karl, ""I just had a big argument with you that evening. I must still have a terrible bruise."" And he felt the back of his head.","‘Yes,’ said Karl, ‘earlier this evening I had a great fight with them. I must have a terrible bump there.’ And he felt the back of his head.","“Yes,” said Karl, “just this evening I had a big fight with them. I probably still have a dreadful bruise.” And he felt the back of his head."
"Sie kamen durch eine Abteilung der Küche, wo einige Mädchen in schmutzigen Schürzen – sie begossen sie absichtlich – Geschirr in großen Bottichen reinigten. Der Heizer rief eine gewisse Line zu sich, legte den Arm um ihre Hüfe und führte sie, die sich immerzu kokett gegen seinen Arm drückte, ein Stückchen mit. „Es gibt jetzt Auszahlung, willst Du mit?"" fragte er. „Warum soll ich mich bemühn, bring mir das Geld lieber mit"", antwortete sie, schlüpfe unter dem Arm durch und lief davon. „Wo hast Du denn den schönen Knaben aufgega- belt"", rief sie noch, wollte aber keine Antwort mehr. Man horte das Lachen aller Mädchen, die ihre Arbeit unterbrochen hatten.","They passed through a section of the kitchen where some girls in dirty aprons - they deliberately watered them - were washing dishes in large vats. The stoker called a certain Line to him, put his arm around her hips and led her along for a bit, as she kept coquettishly pressing against his arm. ""There's a payout now, do you want to go with me?"" he asked. ""Why should I bother, bring me the money with you,"" she replied, slipping under the arm and running away. ""Where did you find that handsome boy?"" she called out, but didn't want to answer. All the girls who had interrupted their work could be heard laughing.","They came to a part of the Kitchen where a few girls in dirty aprons – which they were spattering on purpose – were cleaning crockery in large vats. The stoker called out to one Lina, put his arm around her hip, and walked with her for a few steps, as she pressed herself flirtatiously against him. ‘We’re just off to get paid, do you want to come?’ he asked. ‘Why should I bother, just bring me the money yourself,’ she replied, slipped round his arm and ran off. ‘Where did you get the good-looking boy from?’ she added, not really expecting an answer. The other girls, who had stopped their work to listen, all laughed.","They passed through a section of the kitchen where some girls in dirty aprons—which they wet deliberately—were washing dishes in great tubs. The stoker called over a certain Line, put his arm around her hips, and as she pressed coquettishly against his arm, swept her along for a moment. “It’s payday, you want to come along?” he asked. “Why should I bother, you can bring me my money,” she replied, and, slipping out from under his arm, ran off. “So where did you pick up that pretty boy,” she cried out again, without expecting a reply. One could hear laughter from all of the girls, who had interrupted their work."
"Ein wenig enttäuscht setzte man sich wieder, hie und da drehte sich noch einer nach der Schiedsrichtertribüne um, aber bald beschäfigte man sich nur mit dem reichli- chen Essen, großes Geflügel, wie es Karl noch nie gese- hen hatte, mit vielen Gabeln in dem knusprig gebratenen Fleisch, wurde herumgetragen, Wein wurde immer wie- der von den Dienern eingeschenkt – man merkte es kaum, man war über seinen Teller gebückt und in den Becher fiel der Strahl des roten Weines – und wer sich an der allgemeinen Unterhaltung nicht beteiligen wollte, konnte Bilder von Ansichten des Teaters von Oklahama besichtigen, die an einem Ende der Tafel aufgestapelt waren und von Hand zu Hand gehen sollten. Doch kümmerte man sich nicht viel um die Bilder und so ge- schah es daß bei Karl, der der Letzte war nur ein Bild ankam. Nach diesem Bild zu schließen mußten aber alle sehr sehenswert sein. Dieses Bild stellte die Loge des Präsidenten der Vereinigten Staaten dar. Beim ersten Anblick konnte man denken, es sei nicht eine Loge, son- dern die Bühne, so weit geschwungen ragte die Brüstung in den freien Raum. Diese Brüstung war ganz aus Gold in allen ihren Teilen. Zwischen den wie mit der feinsten Scheere ausgeschnittenen Säulchen waren nebeneinander Medaillons früherer Präsidenten angebracht, einer hatte eine auffallend gerade Nase, aufgeworfene Lippen und unter gewölbten Lidern starr gesenkte Augen. Rings um die Loge, von den Seiten und von der Höhe kamen Strahlen von Licht; weißes und doch mildes Licht ent- hüllte förmlich den Vordergrund der Loge, während ihre Tiefe hinter rotem, unter vielen Tönungen sich fal- tendem Sammt der an der ganzen Umrandung niederfiel und durch Schnüre gelenkt wurde, als eine dunkle röt- lich schimmernde Leere erschien. Man konnte sich in dieser Loge kaum Menschen vorstellen, so selbstherrlich sah alles aus. Karl vergaß das Essen nicht, sah aber doch of die Abbildung an, die er neben seinen Teller gelegt hatte.","A little disappointed, everyone sat down again, every now and then someone turned to look at the referee's stand, but soon they were just busy with the plentiful food, large fowl, the likes of which Karl had never seen before, with many forks in them the crispy roasted meat was carried around, the servants poured wine over and over again – you hardly noticed it, you were bending over your plate and the stream of red wine fell into the cup – and who didn’t take part in the general conversation was able to see pictures of views of the Oklahama Theater stacked at one end of the board to go from hand to hand. But nobody paid much attention to the pictures and so it happened that Karl, who was the last one, only got one picture. Judging by this picture, however, they all had to be very worth seeing. This picture represented the box of the President of the United States. At first sight one might think that it was not a box but the stage, the parapet jutted so far into the open space. This parapet was all of gold in all its parts. Between the columns, cut out as if with the finest scissors, medallions of previous presidents were attached next to each other. One had a strikingly straight nose, pursed lips and staringly lowered eyes under arched lids. Around the box, from the sides and from above, came rays of light; white yet soft light formally revealed the foreground of the box, while its depth behind red velvet, wrinkled in many tones, falling all around the perimeter and guided by cords, appeared as a dark reddish shimmering emptiness. One could hardly imagine people in this box, everything looked so self-important. Karl didn't forget to eat, but he often looked at the picture he had placed next to his plate.","A little disappointed, they all sat down again, now and then someone would turn to look at the stewards’ stand, but soon they were quite preoccupied by the plentiful meal, some poultry bigger than any Karl had ever seen, with many forks stuck in their crisply roasted flesh, were carried around, and wine glasses kept being replenished by the servants – one almost didn’t notice it, bending over one’s plate, and a thin stream of red wine fell into one’s glass – and anyone who didn’t care to participate in the general conversation could look at pictures of the Theatre in Oklahoma, which had been piled up at one end of the table, from where they were supposed to be passed from hand to hand. But no very great attention was paid to the pictures, and so it happened that Karl, at the end of the row, got to see only one of them. To go by this one picture, though, they must all have been very well worth seeing. This picture showed the box of the President of the United States. At first sight, one might think it wasn’t a box at all, but the stage, so far did the curved balustrades jut out into empty space. The balustrades were entirely made of gold. In between little pillars that might have been cut out by the minutest scissors, there was a row of portraits of former presidents, one had a strikingly straight nose, thickish lips and stubbornly lowered eyes under bulging lids. The box was brightly lit from all sides and from above; white and yet somehow mild light laid bare the front of the box, whereas its recesses, deepening pleats of red velvet falling full length and swagged by cords, were a darkly glimmering void. It was hardly possible to imagine people in this box, so sumptuously self-sufficient did it look. Karl didn’t forget to eat, but he often looked at the picture too, having put it next to his plate.","A little disappointed, everyone sat down again; now and then one of them would turn around to glance at the judges’ platform, but before long everyone was completely absorbed by the lavish meal; large fowl such as Karl had never seen before, with numerous forks stuck into the crisply roasted meat, were carried around; the servants kept on pouring wine—hunched over one’s place, one scarcely noticed the stream of red wine dropping into one’s glass—and anyone who did not wish to take part in the general conversation could look at the pictures of the Theater of Oklahama, which were stacked at one end of the table and were supposed to be passed around. But the others showed little interest in the pictures, and consequently only a single picture reached Karl, who was last. If this one was any indication, all of the others must have been worth seeing too. It showed the box reserved for the President of the United States. At first glance one might easily have believed that it was not simply a box but the actual stage, so forcefully did the balustrade sweep out into open space. The entire balustrade was gilded. Hanging side by side between its small pillars, which looked as though they had been cut out with the finest scissors, were medallions of former presidents, one of whom had a remarkably straight nose, thick curved lips, and eyes that looked straight down from beneath his arched brows. Rays of light streamed around the box, from all sides and also from above; the section of the box in the foreground was bathed in a white yet soft light, whereas its deeper recesses, behind red velvet draped in folds of varying shades all along the perimeter of the box and held in check by cords, seemed like a dark red-shimmering void. So grandiose did everything look that one could scarcely imagine people in this box. Though Karl did not neglect his food, he gazed often at the reproduction, which he had placed beside his plate."
"Unwillkürlich wendete er sich dann der Tür zu und tastete sich auf allen Vieren hin. Bald erfühlte er mit den Fingerspitzen einen Stiefel und weiterhin ein Bein. Das war Robinson, wer schlief sonst in Stiefeln? Man hatte ihm befohlen, sich quer vor die Tür zu legen, um Karl an der Flucht zu hindern. Aber kannte man denn Karls Zustand nicht? Vorläufig wollte er gar nicht entfliehen, er wollte nur ans Licht kommen. Konnte er also nicht zur Tür hinaus, so mußte er auf den Balkon.","Instinctively he turned to the door and groped his way on all fours. Soon he felt a boot with his fingertips and then a leg. That was Robinson, who else slept in boots? He had been ordered to lie across the door to prevent Karl from escaping. But didn't people know Karl's condition? For the time being he didn't want to escape at all, he just wanted to come to light. So if he couldn't get out the door, he had to go onto the balcony.","Automatically he first turned towards the door, and groped his way there on all fours. Before long, he came upon a boot with his fingertips, and then a leg. That had to be Robinson, who else would sleep in his boots? He had been ordered to lie across the doorway to prevent Karl from escaping. But did they not know what condition he was in? What he wanted now wasn’t to escape, but to get at the light. If he couldn’t get out by the door, he would have to go out on the balcony.","Quite involuntarily he turned to the door and groped toward it on all fours. Probing with his fingers, he soon felt a boot and then a leg. It was Robinson, who else slept in his boots? He had been given an order to lie down across the doorway so as to prevent Karl from fleeing. But didn’t they know about Karl’s condition? He did not want to flee just now, he simply wished to get into the light. And so if he could not go through the door, he would have to go to the balcony."
"Da winkte ihn Robinson zu sich heran und flüsterte unter Schlingbewegungen, die schon ganz deutlich wa- ren: „Roßmann, mir ist sehr schlecht."" „Zum Teufel"", entfuhr es Karl und mit beiden Händen schleppte er ihn zum Geländer.","Then Robinson waved him over and whispered, with swishing movements that were already very clear: ""Roßmann, I'm feeling very sick.""","Then Robinson beckoned him nearer and whispered with unmistakable heaving movements: ‘Rossmann, I feel sick.’ ‘Goddamnit!’ Karl exclaimed, and with both hands he dragged him to the railing.","Just then Robinson waved him over and whispered amid gagging motions that were already quite unmistakable: “Rossmann, I feel very sick.” “What the devil,” Karl exclaimed involuntarily, and then with both hands he seized Robinson and dragged him over to the balustrade."
"„Wer sind Sie denn?"" sagte der Mann, legte den Feder- halter in das vor ihm geöffnete Buch und trat an das Geländer. „Wie heißen Sie? Wie kommen Sie zu den Leuten? Sind Sie schon lange hier? Was wollen Sie denn anschauen? Drehen Sie doch Ihre Glühlampe dort auf, damit man Sie sehen kann.""","""Who are you then?"" said the man, put the pen in the book that was open in front of him and went to the railing. ""What's your name? How do you get to the people? Have you been here long? What do you want Look? Turn on your lightbulb there so they can see you.""","said the man, and laid his pen down on his open book, and walked up to the railing. ‘What’s your name? How did you come to be with those people? Have you been here long? What did you want to look at? Turn your lamp on, so that I can have a look at you.’","said the man, and after putting his fountain pen on his book, which lay open before him, he stepped over to the balustrade. “What’s your name? How do you come to be with those people? Have you been here long? Well, what do you want to look at? And do turn up your electric lamp so that I can see you.”"
"„Du kannst ruhig staunen"", fuhr Robinson fort, selbst ich habe gestaunt, wie mir das der Diener damals erzählt hat. Denk nur, wenn Brunelda nicht Zuhause war, hat sich der Mann von dem Diener in ihre Zimmer führen lassen und immer eine Kleinigkeit als Andenken mitgenommen und immer etwas sehr Teueres und Fei- nes für Brunelda zurückgelassen und dem Diener streng verboten zu sagen von wem es ist. Aber einmal als er etwas – wie der Diener sagte und ich glaub es – geradezu Unbezahlbares aus Porzellan mitgebracht hatte, muß Brunelda es irgendwie erkannt haben, hat es sofort auf den Boden geworfen, ist darauf herumgetreten, hat es angespuckt und noch einiges andere damit gemacht, so daß es der Diener vor Ekel kaum heraustragen konnte.""","""You can be amazed,"" Robinson continued, even I was amazed when the servant told me that back then. Just think, when Brunelda wasn't at home, the man let the servant take him to her room and always had a little something taken as souvenirs, and always left something very expensive and fine for Brunelda, and strictly forbidden to tell the servant who it was.But once, when he had brought back--as the servant said, and I think it was--virtually priceless made of china, must Brunelda somehow recognized it, immediately threw it on the floor, stepped on it, spat on it and did a number of other things with it, so that the servant could hardly carry it out for disgust.""","‘You might well be amazed,’ Robinson continued, ‘I was amazed too, when the servant told me that at the time. Imagine, when Brunelda was out of the house, the man had himself admitted into her room by the butler, and he always took away some little nick-nack as a memento, and left something very fine and expensive in its place for Brunelda, with strict instructions to the butler not to say who it was from. But on one occasion – I have it from the butler, and I believe him – he left some absolutely priceless piece of porcelain, and Brunelda must have recognized it somehow, and she threw it on the floor and trod on it and spat on it, and did a few other things besides, so that the man was almost too disgusted to carry it outside.’","“You’ve good reason to be amazed,” Robinson continued, “I, too, was amazed when the servant told me. Just imagine: if Brunelda wasn’t at home, the man would ask the servant to take him to her rooms, and he always took some little trifle as a keepsake, always leaving something very expensive and elegant for Brunelda, and the servant was strictly forbidden to say who it was from. But once, after he had brought some priceless porcelain object—so the servant said, and I can certainly believe him—Brunelda must somehow have recognized it; she threw it on the floor, stepped on it, spat on it, and did certain other things to it; the servant was so nauseated, he could hardly carry it out.”"
"Am nächsten Tage bestand Karl darauf gleich seinen Dienst anzutreten, trotzdem ihm die Oberköchin diesen Tag für die Besichtigung von Ramses freigeben wollte. Aber Karl erklärte offen, dafür werde sich noch Gele- genheit finden, jetzt sei es für ihn das Wichtigste mit der Arbeit anzufangen, denn eine auf ein anderes Ziel ge- richtete Arbeit habe er schon in Europa nutzlos abgebrochen und fange als Lifjunge in einem Alter an, in dem wenigstens die tüchtigem Jungen nahe daran sei- en in natürlicher Folge eine höhere Arbeit zu überneh- men. Es sei ganz richtig daß er als Lifjunge anfange, aber ebenso richtig sei, daß er sich besonders beeilen müsse. Bei diesen Umständen würde ihm die Besichti- gung der Stadt gar kein Vergnügen machen. Nicht ein- mal zu einem kurzen Weg, zu dem ihn Terese auffor- derte konnte er sich entschließen. Immer schwebte ihm der Gedanke daran vor Augen, es könne schließlich mit ihm, wenn er nicht fleißig sei, soweit kommen wie mit Delamarche und Robinson.","The next day, Karl insisted on going to work straight away, even though the head cook wanted to give him that day to visit Ramses. But Karl openly declared that there would still be an opportunity for this, that the most important thing for him was to start work now, because he had already broken off work aimed at a different goal in Europe and was starting as a life boy at an old age in which at least the able-bodied youngsters are close to taking on a higher job as a natural consequence. It was quite right that he should start as a Lifjunge, but it was also right that he had to hurry up. Under these circumstances, he would not enjoy touring the city at all. He couldn't even make up his mind to take a short walk, which Terese asked him to do. The thought always floated before his eyes that, if he wasn't diligent, things could eventually go as far as with Delamarche and Robinson.","The next day Karl insisted on beginning work right away, even though the Head Cook wanted to give him the day off for sightseeing in Ramses. But Karl replied frankly that there would be opportunities for that later, and the most important thing for him now was to start work, because he had already once had to break off a career in Europe without anything to show for it, and he was starting as a lift-boy at an age in which the more advanced boys at any rate were almost ready to move on to better jobs. It was perfectly right and proper that he should be starting off as lift-boy, but by the same token he was in a hurry. Under the circumstances, sightseeing in the city would be no pleasure to him at all. He wasn’t even prepared to go for a short walk with Therese. Always at the back of his mind was the thought that, if he didn’t apply himself, he might finish up like Delamarche and Robinson.","Next day Karl insisted on taking up his duties at once, even though the head cook had wanted to let him take the day off to visit Ramses. But Karl responded frankly that there would be more such opportunities, and that his most important task now was to start work, for at a younger age in Europe he had fruitlessly broken off work that was directed toward a different goal, and now here he was starting off as a lift boy at an age when in the natural sequence of events the more assiduous youths at least were about to take on higher-level positions. It was, he said, very fitting that he should start as a lift boy but equally fitting that he should do so with special haste. Under these circumstances a visit to the city would give him no pleasure whatsoever. He could not even decide to take a short route suggested by Therese. And he kept thinking that if he was not diligent, he might end up like Delamarche and Robinson."
"Sie giengen durch einen langen schmalen Flurgang, der mit dunklen glatten Steinen gepflastert war. Hie und da öffnete sich rechts oder links ein Treppenaufgang oder man erhielt einen Durchblick in einen andern größern Flur. Erwachsene waren kaum zu sehn, nur Kinder spielten auf den leeren Treppen. An einem Geländer stand ein kleines Mädchen und weinte, daß ihr vor Tränen das ganze Gesicht glänzte. Kaum hatte sie Dela- marche bemerkt als sie mit offenem Mund nach Luf schnappend die Treppe hinauflief und sich erst hoch oben beruhigte, als sie nach häufigem Umdrehn sich überzeugt hatte, daß ihr niemand folge oder folgen wol- le. „Die habe ich vor einem Augenblick niedergerannt"", sagte Delamarche lachend und drohte ihr mit der Faust, worauf sie schreiend weiter hinauflief.","They passed down a long, narrow corridor paved with dark smooth stones. Here and there a stairway opened up to the right or left, or you got a glimpse of another, larger hallway. There were hardly any adults to be seen, only children playing on the empty stairs. A little girl was standing by a railing and weeping so that her whole face was glistening with tears. She had scarcely noticed Delamarche when she ran up the stairs, gasping for air, and only calmed down at the top when, after turning around frequently, she was convinced that no one was following her or wanted to follow her. ""I ran down that a moment ago,"" said Delamarche, laughing, and shook his fist at her, causing her to run screaming on up.","They were going down a long, narrow passage which was paved with smooth, dark stones. Occasionally, to right or left, there was a flight of stairs or you could see another, larger passage. There were hardly any grown-ups to be seen, only children playing on the empty stairs. On one balustrade there was a little girl crying so hard that her face was quite shiny with tears. No sooner had she spotted Delamarche than she ran up the stairs, gasping open-mouthed for breath, and only calmed herself when she had climbed several flights, looking round frequently to make sure no one was following her or was about to follow her. ‘ I ran her down just a moment ago,’ said Delamarche laughing, and waved his fist at her, whereupon she screamed and ran up some more steps.","They walked down a long narrow corridor paved with smooth dark stones. Now and then a flight of stairs opened off to the right or left, or one could suddenly see down another longer corridor. There were almost no adults visible, only a few children playing on the empty stairs. Standing on a balcony was a little girl, weeping so copiously that her entire face glistened with tears. No sooner had she noticed Delamarche than she ran up the stairs with her mouth wide open, gasping for breath, and composed herself only after she had climbed up higher, after turning around several times to assure herself that no one was following her or was about to do so. “That’s the one I just ran over,” said Delamarche, laughing, and threatened her with his fist, causing her to run up higher, screaming."
"„Was Ihr getrieben habt"", sagte Karl, von der Ge- schichte ganz gefangen genommen und setzte sich auf den Boden. „Das war also Brunelda?"" „Nun ja"", sagte Robinson, „das war Brunelda.""","""What you did,"" said Karl, completely taken by the story, and sat down on the floor. ""So that was Brunelda?"" ""Well, yes,"" said Robinson, ""that was Brunelda.""","‘Such goings on,’ said Karl, quite captivated by the story, and sat down on the ground. ‘So that was Brunelda?’ ‘That’s right,’ said Robinson, ‘that was Brunelda.’","“You’re always up to something,” said Karl, and spellbound by the story, he sat down on the floor. “So it was Brunelda?” “Well, yes,” said Robinson, “it was Brunelda.”"
"Inzwischen war Herr Pollunder zu Karl getreten und hatte ihn sanf von Herrn Green weg zu einem der gro- ßen Fenster gezogen. „Lieber Herr Roßmann"", sagte er zu Karls Ohr herabgebeugt und wischte zur Vorberei- tung mit dem Taschentuch über sein Gesicht und bei der Nase innehaltend schneuzte er, „Sie werden doch nicht glauben, daß ich Sie gegen Ihren Willen hier zurückhal- ten will. Davon ist ja keine Rede. Das Automobil kann ich Ihnen zwar nicht zur Verfügung stellen, denn es steht weit von hier in einer Öffentlichen Garage, da ich noch keine Zeit hatte, hier, wo alles erst im Werden ist, eine eigene Garage einzurichten. Der Chauffeur wiederum schläf nicht hier im Haus, sondern in der Nähe der Garage, ich weiß wirklich selbst nicht wo. Außerdem ist es gar nicht seine Pflicht jetzt zuhause zu sein, seine Pflicht ist es nur, früh zur rechten Zeit hier vorzufahren. Aber das alles wären keine Hindernisse für Ihre augenblickliche Heimkehr, denn wenn Sie darauf bestehn, begleite ich Sie sofort zur nächsten Station der Stadtbahn, die allerdings so weit entfernt ist, daß Sie nicht viel früher zuhause ankommen dürfen, als wenn Sie früh – wir fahren ja schon um sieben Uhr – mit mir in meinem Automobil fahren wollen."" „Da möchte ich, Herr Pollunder, doch lieber mit der Stadtbahn fahren"", sagte Karl. „An die Stadtbahn habe ich gar nicht ge- dacht. Sie sagen selbst daß ich mit der Stadtbahn früher ankomme, als früh mit dem Automobil."" „Es ist aber ein ganz kleiner Unterschied."" „Trotzdem, trotzdem Herr Pollunder"", sagte Karl, „ich werde in Erinnerung an Ihre Freundlichkeit immer gerne herkommen, vor- ausgesetzt natürlich daß Sie mich nach meinem heutigen Benehmen noch einladen wollen, und vielleicht werde ich es nächstens besser ausdrücken können, warum heu- te jede Minute, um die ich meinen Onkel früher sehe, für mich so wichtig ist."" Und als hätte er bereits die Erlaub- nis zum Weggehn erhalten, fügte er hinzu: „Aber kei- nesfalls dürfen Sie mich begleiten. Es ist auch ganz un- nötig. Draußen ist ein Diener der mich gern zur Station begleiten wird. Jetzt muß ich nur noch meinen Hut su- chen."" Und bei den letzten Worten durchschritt er schon das Zimmer, um noch in Eile einen letzten Ver- such zu machen, ob sein Hut doch vielleicht zu finden wäre. „Könnte ich Ihnen nicht mit einer Mütze aushel- fen"", sagte Herr Green und zog eine Mütze aus der Tasche, „vielleicht paßt sie Ihnen zufällig."" Verblüf blieb Karl stehn und sagte: „Ich werde Ihnen doch nicht Ihre Mütze wegnehmen. Ich kann ja ganz gut mit unbe- decktem Kopf gehn. Ich brauche gar nichts."" „Es ist nicht meine Mütze. Nehmen Sie nur!"" „Dann danke ich"", sagte Karl um sich nicht aufzuhalten und nahm die Mütze. Er zog sie an und lachte zuerst, da sie ganz genau paßte, nahm sie wieder in die Hand und betrachtete sie, konnte aber das Besondere das er an ihr suchte, nicht finden; es war eine vollkommen neue Mütze. „Sie paßt so gut!"" sagte er. „Also sie paßt!"" rief Herr Green und schlug auf den Tisch.","Meanwhile Mr. Pollunder had stepped up to Karl and gently pulled him away from Mr. Green towards one of the large windows. ""Dear Mr. Roßmann,"" he said, leaning down to Karl's ear and wiping his face with his handkerchief in preparation and pausing by his nose, he blew his nose, ""you surely won't believe that I want to keep you here against your will ""That's out of the question. I can't make the car available to you, because it's far from here in a public garage, since I haven't had time to set up my own garage here, where everything is just beginning to happen."" The chauffeur, on the other hand, doesn't sleep here in the house, but near the garage, I really don't know where myself. Besides, it's not his duty to be at home now, it's his duty to drive up here early at the right time. But that none of this would be an obstacle to your immediate return, because if you insist, I will accompany you immediately to the next station of the light rail, which is, however, so far away that you are not allowed to get home much earlier, than if you want to drive with me in my car early in the morning - we leave at seven o'clock."" ""I'd rather take the tram, Herr Pollunder,"" said Karl. ""I hadn't even thought of the tram. You say yourself that I'll get there earlier on the tram than I can by car."" ""But it's a very small difference."" ""Nevertheless, Herr Pollunder,"" said Karl, ""in memory of your friendliness I'll always be happy to come here, provided of course that after my behavior today you still want to invite me, and maybe next time I'll be able to explain better why every minute I see my uncle earlier is so important to me today."" And as if he had already been given permission to leave, he added: ""But kei - If not, you may accompany me. It is also quite unnecessary. There is a servant outside who would be happy to accompany me to the station. Now I only have to look for my hat."" And as he said the last words, he was already crossing the room to make one last hurry to see if his hat might be found. ""Couldn't I help you out with a cap,"" said Mr. Green, pulling a cap out of his pocket, ""perhaps it might fit you."" Karl stopped in amazement and said: ""I'm not going to take your cap away from you. I can walk quite well with my head uncovered. I don't need anything."" ""It's not my cap. Just take it!"" ""Thank you, then,"" said Karl, not wanting to stop and took the hat. He put it on and laughed at first because it fit perfectly, took it in his hand again and looked at it, but he could see the special thing he was looking for in her , couldn't find it; it was a brand new cap. ""It fits so well!"" he said. ""Well, it fits!"" exclaimed Mr. Green and banged on the table.","In the meantime Mr Pollunder had gone up to Karl and had gently pulled him away from Mr Green to one of the big windows. ‘ Dear Mr Rossmann,’ he said, bending down to Karl’s ear, giving his face a preparatory wipe with his handkerchief, stopping at his nose, which he blew. ‘Surely you can’t believe that I want to detain you against your will. There’s no question of that. I am afraid I can’t put the car at your disposal, because it is kept at a public garage some way from here, as I have yet to build my own garage here, where everything is still at an early stage. Moreover, the chauffeur doesn’t sleep here either, but somewhere near the garage, I’m not exactly sure where myself. Besides it’s no part of his duties to be here, all he has to do is to pick me up at the right time each morning. But all of that needn’t impede your immediate return home in any way because, if you insist, I will accompany you straightaway to the nearest suburban line railway station, although that is actually so far away from here that you wouldn’t arrive home much earlier than if you came along with me in the morning – we leave by seven o’clock – in the car.’ ‘That being so, Mr Pollunder, I’d still like to take the train,’ said Karl. ‘I never thought of the train. You just said yourself that I’d get there quicker by train than if I came in the car in the morning.’ ‘It’s only a very tiny difference.’ ‘Never mind, Mr Pollunder, never mind that,’ said Karl, ‘remembering your kindness to me, I will always be very glad to come here, assuming of course that after my behaviour of today you will still want to invite me, and perhaps in the future I will better be able to explain why every minute by which I might see my uncle the sooner is so vital to me.’ And, as though he had already been granted permission to leave, he added: ‘But you mustn’t accompany me. It’s quite unnecessary. There is a servant outside who will be happy to walk me to the station. Now I just have to find my hat’ And with these last words, he started across the room, just for one last look to see where his hat might be. ‘Perhaps I could help you out with a cap,’ said Mr Green, pulling a cap out of his pocket, ‘maybe this one fits you.’ Karl stopped in astonishment and said: ‘I’m not about to deprive you of your cap. I can perfectly well go bareheaded. I don’t need anything.’ ‘It’s not my cap. Go on take it!’ ‘In that case, thank you,’ said Karl so as not to delay matters, and he took the cap. He pulled it on, and then he had to laugh because it fitted so well, then he took it in his hand and looked at it, but he couldn’t find whatever feature he was looking for; it was a completely new cap. ‘ It fits so perfectly!’ he said. ‘Good, it fits!’ said Mr Green and pounded the table.","Meanwhile Mr. Pollunder had approached Karl and gently drawn him away from Mr. Green toward one of the large windows. “My dear Mr. Rossmann,” he said, bending down to Karl’s ear; and then, as if readying himself, he wiped his face with a handkerchief, stopped at his nose, and blew it. “Surely you don’t think I want to keep you here against your will. That’s absolutely not the case. But I cannot place the automobile at your disposal, since it’s parked far away in a public garage, and I have not yet had the time to set up my own garage, everything still being in flux here. In any case the chauffeur doesn’t sleep in the house but somewhere near the garage; I don’t quite know where. Besides, he is under no obligation to be at home just now—he must simply arrive here with the automobile on time each morning. But none of this would be an obstacle to your returning home this instant, and if you insist, I shall accompany you at once to the next station on the suburban line, which is so far away that you’d probably not reach home much earlier —we’re leaving at seven—than if you went by automobile.” “Well, Mr. Pollunder, in that case I should prefer to take the suburban train,” said Karl. “I hadn’t even thought of the train. You said if I took the train I’d get back earlier in the morning than if I went by automobile.” “But it doesn’t make much difference.” “Still and all, Mr. Pollunder, still and all,” said Karl, “I shall always be happy to return, for I have such fond memories of your kindness, assuming, of course, that you still want to invite me after the way I’ve behaved today, and perhaps next time I shall be able to give you a better idea why I so value each minute that brings me closer to seeing my uncle again.” And as though he had already received permission to leave, he added: “But on no account should you accompany me. Besides, it’s quite unnecessary. There’s a servant outside, who will gladly accompany me to the station. Now I need only look for my hat.” And as he said those last words, he was already striding across the room to make one last hasty attempt to see whether he could find his hat. “Couldn’t I help you out with this cap,” said Mr. Green, pulling a cap from his briefcase, “it may happen to fit you.” Astonished, Karl halted and said: “But I’m not going to take your cap away from you. I can perfectly well go bareheaded. I don’t need anything.” “It is not my cap. Just take it!” “Well, thank you,” said Karl, and to avoid any further delay he took the cap. He put it on, laughed since it fit perfectly, then took it off and gazed at it, but could not find the distinctive mark he sought; the cap was brand-new. “It fits so well!” he said. “So it does fit!” exclaimed Mr. Green, hitting the table."
"Der Oberkellner sagte neben der Oberköchin halblaut vor sich hin: „Er kam also zu Besuch und war nach- her so betrunken, daß er nicht fortgehn konnte."" Die Oberköchin flüsterte über die Schulter dem Oberkell- ner etwas zu, der mit einem offenbar nicht zu dieser Sache gehörigen Lächeln Einwände zu machen schien. Terese – Karl sah nur zu ihr hin – drückte ihr Gesicht in völliger Hilflosigkeit an die Oberköchin und wollte nichts mehr sehn. Der Einzige der mit Karls Erklärung vollständig zufrieden war, war der Oberportier, welcher einigemal wiederholte: „Es ist ja ganz recht, seinem Saufruder muß man helfen"" und diese Erklärung jedem der Anwesenden durch Blicke und Handbewegungen einzuprägen suchte.","The head waiter said under his breath next to the head cook: ""So he came to visit and afterwards he was so drunk that he couldn't leave."" The head cook whispered something over her shoulder to the head waiter, who obviously didn't smile that went with the matter seemed to object. Terese - Karl just looked at her - pressed her face in complete helplessness against the head cook and did not want to see anything more. The only one who was completely satisfied with Karl's explanation was the head porter, who several times repeated: ""It's quite right, you have to help your drunkard"" and tried to impress this explanation on everyone present by looks and hand movements.","Standing beside the Head Cook, the Head Waiter said softly under his breath: ‘He means to say he visited him, and then got so drunk he couldn’t leave.’ The Head Cook whispered something back over her shoulder to the Head Waiter, who, with a smile on his face that obviously had nothing to do with the present business, seemed to be making some demurral. Therese – Karl was looking now only to her – had seen enough, and pressed her face in complete helplessness against the Head Cook. The only person who was completely satisfied with Karl’s explanation was the Head Porter, who repeated several times: ‘Quite right, you have to help your drinking buddy,’ and sought to impress this explanation on each of those present by looks and gestures.","The head waiter, who now stood next to the head cook, mumbled to himself in a low voice: “So he came to visit and was so drunk afterward that he couldn’t leave on his own.” The head cook whispered a few words over her shoulder to the head waiter, who appeared to raise objections, smiling in a manner evidently unrelated to this affair. Out of helplessness Therese—Karl had eyes only for her—pressed her face up to the head cook, seeking to block out everything else. The only person whom Karl had completely satisfied with his explanation was the head porter, who said repeatedly: “That’s absolutely right, a man has got to help his drinking buddy,” and sought to impress this explanation on all present by means of gazes and gestures."
"„Also Roßmann"", sagte der Oberkellner schnell und wartete gar nicht bis Giacomo draußen war, „Du bist auf der Stelle entlassen.""","""So Roßmann,"" said the head waiter quickly and didn't even wait until Giacomo was outside, ""you're fired on the spot.""","‘Now Rossmann,’ said the Head Waiter quickly, without even waiting for Giacomo to leave the room, ‘you’re dismissed with immediate effect.’","“So, Rossmann,” said the head waiter quickly, without even waiting until Giacomo had left, “you’re dismissed this instant.”"
"Es war eine Erlösung für Karl, als der oberste der Lifjungen, ein gewisser Bess, ein ewig fauchender dik- ker Junge eintrat und die Aufmerksamkeit des Oberpor- tiers ein wenig auf sich lenkte. Karl war so ermattet, daß er kaum grüßte, als er zu seinem Staunen hinter dem Jungen Terese leichenblaß, unordentlich angezogen, mit lose aufgesteckten Haaren hereinschlüpfen sah. Im Augenblick war sie bei ihm und flüsterte: „Weiß es schon die Oberköchin?"" „Der Oberkellner hat es ihr telephoniert"", antwortete Karl. „Dann ist schon gut, dann ist schon gut"", sagte sie rasch mit lebhafen Augen. Nein"", sagte Karl, „Du weißt ja nicht, was sie gegen mich haben. Ich muß weg, die Oberköchin ist davon auch schon überzeugt. Bitte bleib nicht hier, geh hinauf, ich werde mich dann von Dir verabschieden kommen."" Aber Roßmann, was fällt Dir denn ein. Du wirst schön bei uns bleiben, so lange es Dir gefällt. Der Oberkellner macht ja alles, was die Oberköchin will, er liebt sie ja, ich habe es letzthin zufällig erfahren. Da sei nur ruhig."" Bitte Terese geh jetzt weg. Ich kann mich nicht so gut verteidigen wenn Du hier bist. Und ich muß mich genau verteidigen, weil Lügen gegen mich vorgebracht werden. Je besser ich aber aufpassen und mich verteidi- gen kann, desto mehr Hoffnung ist, daß ich bleibe. Also, Therese – "" Leider konnte er in einem plötzlichen Schmerz nicht unterlassen leise hinzuzufügen: „Wenn mich nur dieser Oberportier loslassen würde! Ich wußte gar nicht daß er mein Feind ist. Aber wie er mich immer- fort drückt und zieht."" „Warum sage ich das nur!"" dachte er gleichzeitig, „kein Frauenzimmer kann das ru- hig anhören"" und tatsächlich wendete sich Terese, oh- ne daß er sie noch mit der freien Hand hätte davon abhalten können, an den Oberportier: „Herr Oberpor- tier bitte lassen Sie doch sofort den Roßmann frei. Sie machen ihm ja Schmerzen. Die Frau Oberköchin wird gleich persönlich kommen und dann wird man schon sehn, daß ihm in allem Unrecht geschieht. Lassen Sie ihn los, was kann es Ihnen denn für ein Vergnügen machen ihn zu quälen."" Und sie griff sogar nach des Oberpor- tiers Hand. „Befehl kleines Fräulein, Befehl"", sagte der Oberportier und zog mit der freien Hand Terese freundlich an sich, während er mit der andern Karl nun sogar angestrengt drückte, als wolle er ihm nicht nur Schmerzen machen, sondern als habe er mit diesem in seinem Besitz befindlichen Arm ein besonderes Ziel, das noch lange nicht erreicht sei.","It was a relief for Karl when the chief of the Lifjungen, a certain Bess, a constantly hissing fat boy entered and drew the head porter's attention a little. Karl was so exhausted that he barely said hello when, to his astonishment, he saw Terese slip in behind the boy, pale as a corpse, untidy dressed, her hair loosely pinned up. At the moment she was with him and whispered, ""Does the head cook know?"" ""The head waiter telephoned her,"" answered Karl. ""It's all right then, then it's all right,"" she said quickly with lively eyes. No,"" said Karl, ""you don't know what they have against me. I have to go, the head cook is already convinced of that. Please don't stay here, go upstairs, I'll come and say goodbye to you."" But Roßmann, what are you thinking of. You're welcome to stay with us as long as you like. The head waiter does everything the head cook wants , he loves her, I found out about it the other day. Just be calm."" Please Terese go away now. I can't defend myself very well when you're here. And I have to defend myself properly because lies are being laid against me. But the better I can watch out and defend myself, the more hope there is that I'll stay. Well, Therese - ""Unfortunately, in a sudden pain, he couldn't refrain from adding quietly: ""If only this head porter would let me go! I didn't even know that he was my enemy. But how he keeps pushing and pulling me."" ""Why am I just saying that!"" he thought at the same time, ""no woman can listen to that quietly"" and Terese actually turned to the head porter, without being able to stop her with his free hand: ""Mr Head porter, please release Roßmann immediately. You're causing him pain. The head cook will come in person soon and then you will see that he is being wronged in everything. Let him go, what fun can it give you to torment him.” And she even grabbed the head porter's hand. “Command, little lady, command,” said the head porter and gently pulled Terese up with his free hand himself, while he was now even squeezing Karl with the other, as if he not only wanted to cause him pain, but as if he had a special goal with this arm that was in his possession, which was far from being achieved.","Karl was relieved when the head lift-boy, one Bess, a forever panting fat boy, entered and distracted the attention of the Head Porter. Karl was so exhausted that he could barely manage a greeting, when, to his amazement, he saw a ghostly pale Therese slip into the room after the boy, untidily dressed and with loose, piled-up hair. In an instant she was at his side, whispering: ‘Does the Head Cook know?’ ‘The Head Waiter told her on the telephone,’ replied Karl. ‘ Then everything’s all right, everything’s all right,’ she said quickly, with shining eyes. ‘ No,’ said Karl, ‘you don’t know what it is they are accusing me of. I’ll have to leave, the Head Cook is persuaded of that as well. Please don’t stay here, go back upstairs, I’ll come and say goodbye to you later.’ ‘Rossmann, honestly, what are you saying. You’ll stay here with us as long as you like. The Head Waiter will do anything the Head Cook wants, he’s in love with her, I discovered quite by chance recently. So set your mind at rest.’ ‘Please, Therese, leave me now. I can’t speak so well in my defence when you’re here with me. And I must defend myself carefully, because false accusations are being brought against me. But the more I keep my wits about me and defend myself, the more hope I have of being allowed to stay. So, Therese –’ Unfortunately, in a sudden spasm of pain, he couldn’t stop himself quietly adding: ‘If only the Head Porter would let go of me! I didn’t know he was my enemy. But he keeps squeezing me and lifting me up.’ ‘Why am I saying that!’ he asked himself at the same time, ‘no woman can stand to hear that,’ and indeed Therese turned round and, undeterred by the waving of his free hand, said to the Head Porter: ‘Head Porter, sir, will you please let go of Rossmann. You’re hurting him. The Head Cook will be here any minute, and then we’ll see that he’s been unfairly treated. Let him go, how can you take pleasure in tormenting him.’ And she even reached out for the Head Porter’s hand. ‘Orders, missy, orders,’ said the Head Porter, and with his free hand he pulled Therese affectionately to himself, while with the other he squeezed Karl particularly hard, as though not only intending to cause him pain, but as though he had some design on the arm in his possession which was still far from being achieved.","Karl was saved by the entrance of the top lift boy, a forever-panting fat youth named Bess, who drew some of the head waiter’s attention. Karl was so exhausted that he scarcely greeted him, and to his astonishment, he saw Therese slip in behind the boy, pale as a corpse, dressed untidily, her hair bound loosely. A moment later she stood beside him and whispered: “Does the head cook already know?” “The head waiter telephoned her,” Karl responded. “Well then, everything will be fine, just fine,” she said quickly, her eyes animated. “No, it won’t,” said Karl. “After all, you don’t know what they have against me. I’ll have to go away; even the head cook has already been persuaded of this. Please don’t stay here, go upstairs, and I shall come to say goodbye.” “What’s got into you, Rossmann? You can stay here as long as you want. You see, the head waiter does everything the head cook wants; he does love her; I just found this out recently by accident. So calm down.” “Please, Therese, go away now. I cannot defend myself so well in your presence. And I have to defend myself accurately since they’re bringing up lies against me. The more I pay attention and the better I defend myself, the greater my hopes of staying. So, Therese”—unfortunately, due to a sudden attack of pain he could not refrain from adding quietly—“if the head porter would only let me go! I really had no idea he was an enemy of mine. But the way he keeps on grabbing and pulling me.” “Only why am I saying this!” he thought at the same time. “No woman can listen to this calmly.” And indeed, before Karl could use his free hand to restrain her, Therese turned to the head porter and said: “Mr. Head Porter, please let go of Rossmann at once. You’re hurting him. The head cook will soon be here in person, and then it’ll become quite clear how unjustly he’s being treated in every respect. Let him go, what pleasure can you get from tormenting him?” And she even reached for the head porter’s hand. “It was an order, young miss, an order,” said the head porter, drawing Therese amiably toward himself with his free hand while squeezing Karl even more strenuously with the other, as though he not only wanted to cause him pain but also had special designs on the arm currently in his possession that were by no means realized yet."
"Auf dem Gang setzte sich Karl, nachdem sie weit ge- nug von der Tür der Vermieterin waren, mit der Tasse auf den Boden, um vor allem die Tasse zu reinigen, die zusammengehörigen Dinge zu sammeln, also die Milch zusammenzugießen, die verschiedenen Butterüberbleib- sel auf einen Teller zu kratzen, dann alle Anzeichen des Gebrauches zu beseitigen, also die Messer und Löffel zu reinigen, die angebissenen Brötchen geradezuschneiden und so dem ganzen ein besseres Ansehen zu geben. Ro- binson hielt diese Arbeit für unnötig und behauptete, das Frühstück hätte schon of noch viel ärger ausgesehn, aber Karl ließ sich durch ihn nicht abhalten und war noch froh, daß sich Robinson mit seinen schmutzigen Fingern an der Arbeit nicht beteiligen wollte. Um ihn in Ruhe zu halten, hatte ihm Karl gleich, allerdings ein für alle mal, wie er ihm dabei sagte, einige Cakes und den dicken Bodensatz eines früher mit Chokolade gefüllten Töpfchens zugewiesen.","In the corridor, after they were far enough from the landlady's door, Karl sat down with the cup on the floor, mainly to clean the cup, to collect the things that belong together, i.e. to pour the milk together, the various butter residues. scraping it onto a plate, then removing all signs of use, i.e. cleaning the knives and spoons, straightening the eaten rolls and giving the whole thing a better look. Robinson considered this work unnecessary and claimed that breakfast often looked a lot worse, but Karl didn't let that stop him and was glad that Robinson didn't want to help with the work with his dirty fingers. In order to keep him in peace, Karl had given him a few cakes and the thick dregs of a little pot that used to be filled with chocolate, but once and for all, as he told him.","Once they were in the corridor, sufficiently far away from the landlady’s door, Karl sat down on the floor with the cup, first of all to give it a good clean, then to gather together what belonged together, to pour all the milk into one container, to scrape the various pats of butter on to one plate, and then to remove every appearance of use, thus cleaning the knives and spoons, trimming the half-eaten bread rolls, and so put a better complexion on the whole thing. To Robinson this work seemed superfluous, and he insisted that breakfast had often looked much worse, but Karl wouldn’t be talked out of it, and was even glad that Robinson with his dirty fingers wasn’t interested in helping. To keep him quiet, Karl had right away, but, as he told him, in final settlement, given him a few biscuits and the thick sediment of a jug once containing cocoa.","In the corridor, once they were far enough from the landlady’s door, Karl sat down on the floor with the tray, primarily to clean it, to gather items that belonged together by pouring the milk into a single container and scraping the various leftover pieces of butter onto a plate, and then to remove all traces of prior use, in other words, to clean the knives and spoons, and to cut off the half-eaten portions of the rolls, thereby improving the overall appearance. Robinson insisted that this was unnecessary work, claiming that their breakfast had often looked far worse, but Karl would not let Robinson deter him and was happy that the dirty-fingered Robinson would not be helping with this chore. In order to keep him quiet, Karl had immediately doled him out a few cakes, pouring the thick residue of hot chocolate into a little pot."
"nelda. „Ich werde krank von dieser Wirtschaf, Dela- marche, und werde ganz gewiß in Deinen Armen ster- ben. Ich muß das Parfüm haben"", rief sie dann sich auf- raffend, „ich muß es unbedingt haben. Ich gehe nicht früher aus der Wanne ehe man es mir bringt und müßte ich hier bis Abend bleiben."" Und sie schlug mit der Faust ins Wasser, man hörte es aufspritzen.","nelda. 'I'm getting sick of this economy, Delamarche, and I'll certainly die in your arms. I must have the perfume,"" she then cried, pulling herself together, ""I absolutely must have it. I won't get out of the tub before it's brought to me, and I'd have to stay here until evening."" And she hit the water with her fist, you could hear it splashing.","‘This household is making me ill, Delamarche, I can just tell I’m going to die in your arms. I must have the perfume,’ she then cried, pulling herself together, ‘I simply must have it. I’m not leaving the bath until they bring it, even if I have to stay here all day.’ And she petulantly brought her fist down into the water, so that it splashed.","“Instead of looking for the perfume, they’re fighting,” said Brunelda. “Delamarche, this whole mess is making me ill, and I’ll certainly die in your arms. I must have that perfume,” she cried, rousing herself. “I must absolutely have it. I’m not getting out of this tub until they bring it in to me, even if I have to stay here till this evening.” And with her fist she hit the water—one could hear it splashing."
"Inzwischen gieng vor den Fenstern das Hafenleben weiter, ein flaches Lastschiff mit einem Berg von Fäs- sern, die wunderbar verstaut sein mußten, daß sie nicht ins Rollen kamen, zog vorüber und erzeugte in dem Zimmer fast Dunkelheit, kleine Motorboote, die Karl jetzt, wenn er Zeit gehabt hätte, genau hätte ansehn können, rauschten nach den Zuckungen der Hände ei- nes am Steuer aufrecht stehenden Mannes schnurgerade dahin, eigentümliche Schwimmkörper tauchten hie und da selbständig aus dem ruhelosen Wasser, wurden gleich wieder überschwemmt und versanken vor dem erstaun- ten Blick, Boote der Ozeandampfer wurden von heiß arbeitenden Matrosen vorwärtsgerudert und waren voll von Passagieren, die darin, so wie man sie hinein- gezwängt hatte still und erwartungsvoll saßen, wenn es auch manche nicht unterlassen konnten die Köpfe nach den wechselnden Scenerien zu drehn. Eine Bewe- gung ohne Ende, eine Unruhe, übertragen von dem un- ruhigen Element auf die hilflosen Menschen und ihre Werke.","In the meantime, harbor life went on in front of the windows, a flat barge with a mountain of barrels, which had to be wonderfully stowed away so that they didn't roll, passed and almost made the room dark, small motor boats, which Karl now, if he had had time, could have looked closely, after the twitching of the hands of a man standing upright at the wheel, rushed dead straight along, peculiar floating bodies popped out of the restless water here and there, were immediately flooded again and sank before the astonished At last glance, the boats of the ocean liners were being rowed forward by hot-working sailors, and were full of passengers who, as they had been crammed in, sat quietly and expectantly, though some could not help turning their heads at the changing scenes. A movement without end, a restlessness, transferred from the restless element to the helpless people and their works.","In the meantime the life of the harbour was going on outside the windows. A flat barge carrying a mountain of barrels, which must have been miraculously laden so as not to start rolling, passed by and plunged the room into near-darkness. Little motorboats, which Karl would have been in a good position to examine if he’d had the leisure, pursued their dead straight courses, responsive to every twitch of the hands of the men standing up at their wheels. Strange floats surfaced occasionally from the turbulent water, only to become swamped again and sink astonishingly from sight. Boats from the great liners were rowed ashore by toiling sailors, full of passengers who obediently kept their places and sat quietly and expectantly, even though a few couldn’t refrain from turning their heads this way and that to look at the changing scene. All was endless movement, a restlessness communicated by the restless element to the helpless men and their works.","Meanwhile, beyond the windows, the life of the harbor went on: a flat cargo ship transporting a huge pile of barrels, which must have been marvelously well stacked to prevent their rolling about, passed by, plunging the room into almost complete darkness; little motorboats, which Karl could have observed more closely if only he had had the time, rushed straight ahead, guided by the jerking hand of a man who stood erect at the steering wheel; now and then peculiar floating objects bobbed up from the choppy waters of their own accord, only to be quickly covered and to sink before one’s startled eyes; perspiring sailors rowed away from ocean steamers in boats filled with passengers who remained seated expectantly, mostly in silence, in the same seats into which they had been pressed, although some could not refrain from turning their heads to gaze at the changing scenery. There was endless motion, and unrest borne from the restless element to helpless men and their works."
"Desto genauer sah er die vor ihm liegende an und suchte von verschiedenen Seiten den Blick des Vaters aufzufangen. Aber der Vater wollte, wie er auch den An- blick durch verschiedene Kerzenstellungen änderte, nicht lebendiger werden, sein wagrechter starker Schnurrbart sah der Wirklichkeit auch gar nicht ähnlich, es war keine gute Aufnahme. Die Mutter dagegen war schon besser abgebildet, ihr Mund war so verzogen, als sei ihr ein Leid angetan worden und als zwinge sie sich zu lächeln. Karl schien es, als müsse dies jedem der das Bild ansah, so sehr auffallen, daß es ihm im nächsten Augenblick wieder schien, die Deutlichkeit dieses Ein- drucks sei zu stark und fast widersinnig. Wie könne man von einem Bild so sehr die unumstößliche Überzeugung eines verborgenen Gefühls des Abgebildeten erhalten. Und er sah vom Bild ein Weilchen lang weg. Als er mit den Blicken wieder zurückkehrte, fiel ihm die Hand der Mutter auf, die ganz vorn an der Lehne des Fauteuils herabhieng, zum Küssen nahe. Er dachte ob es nicht vielleicht doch gut wäre, den Eltern zu schreiben, wie sie es ja tatsächlich beide und der Vater zuletzt sehr streng in Hamburg von ihm verlangt hatten. Er hatte sich frei- lich, damals, als ihm die Mutter am Fenster an einem schrecklichen Abend die Amerika-Reise angekündigt hatte, unabänderlich zugeschworen, niemals zu schrei- ben, aber was galt ein solcher Schwur eines unerfahrenen Jungen hier in den neuen Verhältnissen. Ebenso gut hat- te er damals schwören können, daß er nach zwei Mona- ten amerikanischen Aufenthaltes General der amerikani- schen Miliz sein werde, während er tatsächlich in einer Dachkammer mit zwei Lumpen beisammen war, in ei- nem Wirtshaus vor Newyork und außerdem zugeben mußte, daß er hier wirklich an seinem Platze war. Und lächelnd prüfe er die Gesichter der Eltern, als könne man aus ihnen erkennen, ob sie noch immer das Verlan- gen hatten, eine Nachricht von ihrem Sohn zu be- kommen.","He looked all the more closely at the one lying in front of him and tried to catch his father's gaze from different sides. But Father didn't want to become more alive, no matter how he changed the view by changing the candle positions, his strong horizontal mustache didn't look like reality at all, it wasn't a good picture. The mother, on the other hand, was better portrayed, her mouth twisted as if she had been harmed and as if she were forcing herself to smile. It seemed to Karl that everyone who looked at the picture must be so struck by this that the next moment it seemed to him again that the clarity of this impression was too strong and almost absurd. How can one get so much from a picture the irrefutable conviction of a hidden feeling of the depicted. And he looked away from the picture for a while. When he looked back again, he noticed his mother's hand, which was hanging down the armrest of the armchair, close enough to be kissed. He wondered if it might not be a good idea to write to his parents, as both of them and his father had recently asked him to do very strictly in Hamburg. Of course, back then, when his mother had announced his trip to America one terrible evening at the window, he had swore to himself that he would never write, but what did such an oath by an inexperienced boy mean here in the new circumstances. He might as well have sworn then that after two months in America he would be a general in the American militia, when in fact he was in an attic with two rags in a tavern outside New York and also admit it had to be that he really was in his place here. And smiling, he examines the faces of the parents, as if one could tell from them whether they still wanted to get a message from their son.","The more minutely he now examined the one in front of him and tried to catch his father’s gaze from various angles. But try as he might, even moving the candle to different points, his father refused to become any more alive, his heavy horizontal moustache didn’t look anything like the real thing, it wasn’t a good photograph. His mother had been better caught, her mouth downdrawn as though she’d suffered some injury, and forcing a smile. Karl thought that that must be so obvious to anyone looking at the picture, that a moment later, it seemed to him that it was too blatant and actually illogical. How could a picture give one an irresistible sense of the concealed feelings of its subject. And he looked away from the photograph for a while. When he looked at it again he was struck by his mother’s hand, dangling from an armrest in the very foreground of the picture, close enough to kiss. He wondered whether he shouldn’t after all write to his parents, as both of them had demanded, his father with particular sternness in Hamburg, at the end. Admittedly he had vowed to himself that terrible evening when his mother had told him that he would be going to America, irrevocably, that he would never write, but what did the vow of an inexperienced boy count in these new circumstances. He might just as well have vowed that after two months in America he would be a general in the American army, whereas in fact he was sharing an attic room with a couple of tramps, in an inn outside New York, and moreover, he had to concede that this was just the right place for him. Smilingly he interrogated his parent’s faces, as though one might tell from them if they still craved news of their son.","He therefore scrutinized the one before him all the more carefully, trying to catch his father’s eye from various angles. But no matter how hard he tried to change his father’s appearance by moving the candle around, he refused to become more animated; besides, there was nothing even remotely true to life about his firm horizontal mustache; it was simply not a good picture. But his mother had been better captured; her mouth was twisted as if she had endured some injury and were forcing herself to smile. To Karl it seemed that everyone who saw the picture would be so struck by this that the next moment it seemed as if the very clarity of this impression was too strong and almost nonsensical. How could a picture make one so unshakably convinced of a hidden emotion in the sitter? And for a moment he averted his eyes. When he looked back, he noticed that his mother’s hand was hanging over the front of the armrest in the foreground, close enough to be kissed. He wondered whether it wouldn’t actually be a good idea to write to his parents, as both of them had indeed requested, and his father very sternly so that last time in Hamburg. True enough, during that terrible evening when his mother had broken the news about the journey to America, he had sworn that he would never write, but in these very different circumstances over here, how much weight should be attached to the oath of an inexperienced youth? He could just as easily have sworn that within a mere two months of his arrival he would be a general in the American militia, whereas in reality he was sitting in the attic room of an inn outside New York with two tramps, and what was more, he had to admit that he was not out of place here. Smiling, he examined the faces of his parents, as though seeking to determine whether they still wanted to receive news from their son."
"Und damit reichte er Karl den Brief. Auf dem Um- schlag stand „An Karl Roßmann. Um Mitternacht per- sönlich abzugeben, wo immer er angetroffen wird."" Schließlich"", sagte Herr Green während Karl den Brief öffnete, „ist es, glaube ich, schon anerkennenswert daß ich Ihretwegen aus Newyork hierhergefahren bin, so daß Sie mich durchaus nicht noch auf den Gängen Ihnen nachlaufen lassen müßten.""","And with that he handed the letter to Karl. The envelope read “To Karl Roßmann. To be handed in personally at midnight, wherever he is found."" Finally,"" said Mr. Green as Karl opened the letter, ""I think it is commendable that I came here from New York on your behalf, so that you certainly cannot would have to let them run after you in the corridors.""","And with that he handed Karl the letter. On the envelope it said: ‘To Karl Rossmann. To be delivered to him at midnight, wherever he may be met’. ‘ Finally,’ said Mr Green, while Karl was opening the letter, ‘I think it’s noteworthy that I’ve driven all the way here from New York on your account , so you really shouldn’t make me chase you up and down corridors on top of that.’","Whereupon he handed Karl the letter. The envelope was addressed thus: “For Karl Rossmann. To be handed to him personally, at midnight, wherever he may be found.” “Besides,” Mr. Green said as Karl opened the letter, “it should be noted that I drove here from New York for your sake, so you shouldn’t make me run down these corridors after you.”"
"Im Speisezimmer des Onkels, das er vom ersten Abend seiner Ankunf noch in Erinnerung hatte, erho- ben sich zwei große dicke Herren zur Begrüßung, ein gewisser Green der eine, ein gewisser Pollunder der zweite, wie sich während des Tischgespräches heraus- stellte. Der Onkel pflegte nämlich kaum ein flüchtiges Wort über irgendwelche Bekannten auszusprechen und überließ es immer Karl durch eigene Beobachtung das Notwendige oder Interessante herauszufinden. Nach- dem während des eigentlichen Essens nur intime ge- schäfliche Angelegenheiten besprochen worden waren, was für Karl eine gute Lektion hinsichtlich kaufmänni- scher Ausdrücke bedeutete, und man Karl still mit sei- nem Essen sich hatte beschäfigen lassen, als sei er ein Kind, das sich vor allem ordentlich sattessen müsse, beugte sich Herr Green zu Karl hin und fragte in dem unverkennbaren Bestreben ein möglichst deutliches Eng- lisch zu sprechen, im allgemeinen nach Karls ersten ame- rikanischen Eindrücken. Karl antwortete unter einer Sterbensstille ringsherum mit einigen Seitenblicken auf den Onkel ziemlich ausführlich und suchte sich zum Dank durch eine etwas newyorkisch gefärbte Redeweise angenehm zu machen. Bei einem Ausdruck lachten sogar alle drei Herren durcheinander und Karl fürchtete schon einen groben Fehler gemacht zu haben, jedoch nein, er hatte wie ihm Herr Pollunder erklärte, sogar etwas sehr Gelungenes gesagt. Dieser Herr Pollunder schien über- haupt an Karl ein besonderes Gefallen zu finden und während der Onkel und Herr Green wieder zu den ge- schäflichen Besprechungen zurückkehrten, ließ Herr Pollunder Karl seinen Sessel nahe zu sich hin schieben, fragte ihn zuerst vielerlei über seinen Namen, seine Her- kunf und seine Reise aus, bis er dann schließlich um Karl wieder ausruhn zu lassen, lachend, hustend und eilig selbst von sich und seiner Tochter erzählte, mit der er auf einem kleinen Landgut in der Nähe von Newyork wohnte, wo er aber allerdings nur die Abende verbrin- gen konnte, denn er war Bankier und sein Beruf hielt ihn in Newyork den ganzen Tag. Karl wurde auch gleich herzlichst eingeladen, auf dieses Landgut herauszukom- men, ein so frischgebackener Amerikaner wie Karl habe ja auch sicher das Bedürfnis sich von Newyork manch- mal zu erholen. Karl bat den Onkel sofort um die Er- laubnis, diese Einladung annehmen zu dürfen und der Onkel gab auch scheinbar freudig diese Erlaubnis, ohne aber ein bestimmtes Datum zu nennen oder auch nur in Erwägung ziehen zu lassen, wie es Karl und Herr Pol- lunder erwartet hatten.","In the uncle's dining room, which he still remembered from the first evening of his arrival, two tall, fat gentlemen rose to greet them, one Green, the other a certain Pollunder, as it turned out during the table conversation. The uncle used to say hardly a passing word about any acquaintances and always left it to Karl to find out what was necessary or interesting by his own observation. After only intimate business matters had been discussed during the actual meal, which gave Karl a good lesson in mercantile terminology, and Karl had been quietly allowed to go about his food as if he were a child, Mr. Green, who above all had to eat his fill properly, leaned towards Karl and, in an unmistakable effort to speak English as clearly as possible, generally asked Karl about his first impressions of America. In a deathly stillness all around, Karl answered quite extensively with a few sideways glances at his uncle and, in thanks, tried to make himself agreeable with a somewhat New York-tinged manner of speaking. All three men laughed at one expression and Karl feared he had made a serious mistake, but no, as Mr. Pollunder explained to him, he had even said something very successful. This Mr. Pollunder seemed to take a special liking to Karl in general, and while the uncle and Mr. Green returned to the business meetings, Mr. Pollunder let Karl push his chair close to him, first asking him many things about his name, his origin and his journey, until finally, to let Karl rest again, he told himself, laughing, coughing and in a hurry, about himself and his daughter, with whom he lived on a small country estate near New York, but that was where he was However, he could only spend the evenings, because he was a banker and his job kept him in New York all day. Karl was also immediately cordially invited to come out to this country estate, a freshly minted American like Karl surely sometimes needs to relax from New York. Karl immediately asked his uncle for permission to accept this invitation, and the uncle apparently happily gave his permission, but without naming a specific date or even considering it, as Karl and Herr Pollunder did had expected.","In his uncle’s dining-room, which he remembered from the evening of his first arrival, two large fat gentlemen rose to greet them, the one was a certain Green, the other a certain Pollunder as became clear during the conversation. It was his uncle’s habit never to say very much by way of introduction, and to leave it to Karl to find out essential or interesting things about people. Over dinner, only private business matters were discussed – it was a good opportunity for Karl to master some business expressions – and Karl was left in peace to get on with his dinner, like a child for whom the most important thing is that it should eat its fill, but afterwards Mr Green leaned across to Karl, and evidently at pains to speak slowly and clearly, asked Karl about his first impressions of America. In the deathly silence that followed Karl replied, giving the occasional look at his uncle, pretty fully and tried to please his listeners by using some New Yorkish expressions. At one such expression all three gentlemen burst out laughing and Karl was afraid he had made some blunder, but no, he had, as Mr Pollunder explained, said something very felicitous. In fact, he seemed to conceive a special fondness for Karl and while the uncle and Mr Green returned to their business discussion Mr Pollunder had Karl move his chair closer to him, first asking him questions about his name, where he was from and the journey here, and then, to let him relax, he talked hurriedly, coughing and laughing, about himself and his daughter, with whom he lived on a little estate outside New York where he was only ever able to spend the evenings because he was a banker and his work kept him in the city all day. Karl was cordially invited to come out to this country estate, such a recent American as Karl must surely need to recover from New York from time to time. Karl asked his uncle for permission to accept this invitation, and his uncle, apparently happily, gave it, though without stipulating or raising the question of a date, as Karl and Mr Pollunder had expected him to do.","In his uncle’s dining room, which he remembered from his first evening, two tall stout gentlemen rose to greet him, one called Green, the other Pollunder, as became evident over dinner. His uncle hardly ever said anything about any of his acquaintances, leaving it up to Karl to discover through his own observations whatever might be considered important or intriguing. After the dinner—in the course of which the conversation was restricted to confidential business matters, which meant that Karl received a good lesson in how to use business terms, they had let him focus quietly on his meal, as if he were a child whose most important task was to eat his fill—Mr. Green leaned over to Karl and, making an unmistakable effort to speak the clearest possible English, asked a few general questions about Karl’s first impressions of America. Occasionally glancing at his uncle, and amid dead silence on all sides, Karl answered at length and, by way of thanking them, sought to make a pleasant impression by using turns of phrase with a certain New York flavor. Upon hearing one such expression, all three gentlemen burst out laughing, and Karl began to fear that he had made a vulgar mistake, but not at all, for as Mr. Pollunder explained to him, he had said something that was actually quite felicitous. Moreover, this Mr. Pollunder seemed to have taken a special liking to Karl, and as his uncle and Mr. Green resumed their business conversation, Mr. Pollunder made Karl pull his chair up close and asked him many different questions, first about his name, his background, and the voyage, until finally, so as to let Karl take another rest, he began to talk rapidly, amid considerable laughter and coughing, about himself and his daughter, with whom he lived on a small country estate near New York, though he could only spend his nights there, for he was a banker whose profession kept him in New York all day. And Karl was most cordially invited to visit his country estate; a freshly minted American like Karl would surely feel the need now and then to recuperate from New York. Karl immediately asked his uncle for permission to accept the invitation, and his uncle granted it with seeming pleasure, although he failed to mention a specific date or even to consider one, as Karl and Mr. Pollunder had expected."
"Es war übrigens keine Zeit sich darüber auszuspre- chen, denn die Zimmerfrau kam herein, genau so ver- schlafen, wie in der Nacht, und trieb alle drei auf den Gang hinaus mit der Erklärung, daß das Zimmer für neue Gäste hergerichtet werden müsse. Davon war aber natürlich keine Rede, sie handelte nur aus Bosheit. Karl der seinen Koffer gerade hatte ordnen wollen, mußte zusehn, wie die Frau seine Sachen mit beiden Händen packte und mit einer Kraf in den Koffer warf, als seien es irgendwelche Tiere, die man zum Kuschen bringen mußte. Die beiden Schlosser machten sich zwar um sie zu schaffen, zupfen sie an ihrem Rock, beklopfen ihren Rücken, aber wenn sie die Absicht hatten Karl damit zu helfen, so war das ganz verfehlt. Als die Frau den Koffer zugeklappt hatte, drückte sie Karl den Halter in die Hand, schüttelte die Schlosser ab, und jagte alle drei mit der Drohung aus dem Zimmer, daß sie, wenn sie nicht folgten, keinen Kaffee bekommen würden. Die Frau mußte offenbar gänzlich daran vergessen haben, daß Karl nicht von allem Anfang an zu den Schlossern gehört hatte, denn sie behandelte sie als eine einzige Bande. Allerdings hatten die Schlosser Karls Kleid ihr verkauf und damit eine gewisse Gemeinsamkeit erwiesen.","Incidentally, there was no time to talk about it, for the chambermaid came in, just as sleepy as she had been the night before, and herded all three out into the corridor, explaining that the room had to be made ready for new guests. But of course there was no question of that, she only acted out of malice. Karl, who was just about to put his suitcase in order, had to watch as the woman grabbed his things with both hands and threw them into the suitcase with such force as if they were some kind of animal that had to be cuddling. The two locksmiths bothered about her, tugging at her skirt and slapping her back, but if they intended to help Karl, that was quite the mistake. When the woman had closed the suitcase, she gave Karl the holder, shook off the locksmiths, and chased all three out of the room, threatening that if they didn't follow, they wouldn't get any coffee. Apparently the woman must have completely forgotten that Karl hadn't belonged to the locksmiths from the start, because she treated them as one single gang. However, the locksmiths had sold Karl's dress to her, thus showing a certain common ground.","There was no time to argue because the cleaner came in, every bit as sleepy as she’d been in the night, and ushered them all out into the corridor, on the grounds that the room had to be got ready for new guests, a specious reason of course, it was pure malice on her part. Karl, who had just wanted to put his suitcase in order, was compelled to look on as the woman gathered up his things in both hands and slung them into the suitcase with such force, as if they were wild animals being brought to heel. The two fitters danced around her, plucked at her skirts, patted her on the back, but if their purpose was to help Karl, it had the opposite effect. When the woman had shut the suitcase she pushed the handle into Karl’s hand, shook off the fitters and drove them all out of the room, threatening them with no coffee if they didn’t leave. The woman seemed to have completely forgotten that Karl hadn’t been with the fitters all along, because she treated them all as one band, although the fitters had sold Karl’s suit, which did at least imply a certain, common purpose.","In any case there was no time to talk about it, since the chambermaid came in, just as sleepy as she had been at night, and drove the three of them out into the corridor, explaining that the room had to be prepared for new guests. Of course there was no way that could be true; she said so out of sheer malice. Karl, who was about to tidy up his trunk, had to watch the woman grab his belongings with both hands and throw them into the trunk with full force, as if they were animals that had to be tamed. The two locksmiths tried to intervene by tugging at her dress and slapping her on the back, but if they were indeed trying to help Karl, their efforts were futile. Once the woman had shut the trunk, she pressed the handle into Karl’s hand, shook off the two locksmiths, and chased the three of them from the room by threatening that if they failed to obey, she would not serve them any coffee. The woman must obviously have completely forgotten that Karl had not been with the locksmiths from the outset, since she was treating them as if they were one gang. Of course, the locksmiths had sold her Karl’s clothes and thereby shown that there was a certain connection."
"Und welchen Zweck hatte sein ganzes Studium ge- habt! Er hatte ja alles vergessen; wenn es darauf ange- kommen wäre, hier sein Studium fortzusetzen, es wäre ihm sehr schwer geworden. Er erinnerte sich daran, daß er zu Hause einmal einen Monat lang krank gewesen war – welche Mühe hatte es ihn damals gekostet, sich nachher wieder in dem unterbrochenen Lernen zurecht- zufinden. Und nun hatte er außer dem Lehrbuch der englischen Handelskorrespondenz schon so lange kein Buch gelesen.","And what purpose had all his studies served! He had forgotten everything; if it had come down to continuing his studies here, it would have been very difficult for him.

"„Jetzt gehe ich ins Bureau und werde den Herren mei- ne Meinung sagen. Es ist niemand mehr da, man muß keine Rücksichten nehmen"", wiederholte der Heizer ver- schiedenartig und wollte im Gehn mit Seitwärtsstoßen des Fußes eine den Weg kreuzende Ratte niedertreten, stieß sie aber bloß schneller in das Loch hinein, das sie noch rechtzeitig erreicht hatte. Er war überhaupt langsam in seinen Bewegungen, denn wenn er auch lange Beine hatte, so waren sie doch zu schwer.","""Now I'm going to the office and I'll tell the gentlemen what I think. There's nobody there anymore, you don't have to be careful,"" repeated the stoker in various ways, and as he walked he tried to kick down a rat crossing the path with his foot sideways, but only pushed it faster into the hole, which it had reached in time He was generally slow in his movements, for although his legs were long, they were too heavy.","‘Now I’m going to the purser’s office to give those gents a piece of my mind. There’s no one left, no point in hanging back any more.’ This the stoker repeated with variations in various ways and he also attempted to crush a rat that crossed their path with a sideways swipe of his boot, but he only succeeded in propelling it into its hole which it had reached just in time. He was generally slow in his movements, for if his legs were long they were also heavy.","“I’m going to the office to give these gentlemen a piece of my mind. There’s nobody around anymore, so it’s no longer necessary to watch what one says,” the stoker said repeatedly, using a variety of formulations, and without breaking stride gave a few side kicks to flatten a rat that had crossed his path, but he merely succeeded in driving it even more quickly into its hole, which it reached just in time. Besides, his movements were slow, for though he had very long legs, they nonetheless weighed him down."
"„Verzeih, Roßmann, Du fragst nicht sehr gescheit"", antwortete Robinson. „Du wirst schon auch noch hier bleiben und wenn man Dich noch ärger behandelt.

By the way, they don't treat me that badly.""","‘I’m sorry, Rossmann, that’s not a very sensible question,’ replied Robinson. ‘You’ll be staying here yourself, even if you get far worse treatment. Anyway, my treatment’s not as bad as all that.’","“I’m sorry, Rossmann, but that’s not a very clever question,” Robinson answered. “You’ll stay too even if you get worse treatment. Besides, I’m not being treated so badly.”"
"Natürlich wurde gleich das ganze Zimmer lebendig. Der Schiffsoffizier am Tisch war aufgesprungen, die Herren von der Hafenbehörde sahen ruhig aber auf- merksam zu, die beiden Herren am Fenster waren ne- beneinander getreten, der Diener, der glaubte, er sei dort, wo schon die hohen Herren Interesse zeigten, nicht mehr am Platze, trat zurück. Der Heizer an der Türe wartete angespannt auf den Augenblick, bis seine Hilfe nötig würde. Der Oberkassier endlich machte in seinem Lehnsessel eine große Rechtswendung.","Of course, the whole room immediately came alive. The ship's officer at the table had jumped up, the gentlemen from the port authorities watched calmly but attentively, the two gentlemen at the window had stepped next to each other, but the servant, who thought he was where the high-ranking gentlemen were already showing interest, was not more in place, resigned. The stoker at the door waited tensely for the moment when his help would be needed. Finally, the head cashier made a big turn to the right in his armchair.","Naturally, with that the whole room suddenly sprang to life. The ship’s officer leapt up from the table , the men from the port authority looked on calmly and watchfully, the two men by the window drew together, while the servant, who believed it was not his place to carry on when his superiors were themselves taking an interest, withdrew. Standing by the door, the stoker waited nervously for the moment at which his assistance might become necessary. Finally the chief cashier swung round to the right in his swivel chair.","All of a sudden the entire room became animated. The ship’s officer jumped up from the table; the gentlemen from the port authority watched, calmly but alertly; the two gentlemen at the window now stood side by side; the attendant, believing his presence was no longer required since even the distinguished gentlemen were now taking an interest in the matter, stepped aside. By the door the stoker waited intently for the moment when his help should be needed again. And finally the chief bursar in his armchair swiveled sharply to the right."
"„Ich verstehe von Politik nichts"", sagte Karl.","""I know nothing about politics,"" said Karl.","‘I don’t know anything about politics,’ said Karl.","“I know nothing about politics,” said Karl."
"„Aber ich muß doch wissen, wie mir ist"", fuhr Robin- son auf, kehrte aber gleich wieder zum Weinen zurück.","""But I must know how I feel,"" Robinson snapped, but he immediately went back to crying.","‘But I’m the one who knows how I feel,’ Robinson exploded, but straightaway burst into tears again.","“But I must know how I feel,” said Robinson, flaring up only to resume his weeping."
"„Geh"", sagte der Oberkellner zu Bess, der gleich da- vonlief. Und dann zur Oberköchin: „Die Sache ist die. Der Oberportier hat den Jungen da nicht zum Spaß fest- gehalten. Unten im Schlafsaal der Lifjungen ist nämlich in einem Bett sorgfältig zugedeckt ein wildfremder schwer betrunkener Mann aufgefunden worden. Man hat ihn natürlich geweckt und wollte ihn wegschaffen. Da hat dieser Mann aber einen großen Radau zu machen ange- fangen, immer wieder herumgeschrien, der Schlafsaal gehöre dem Karl Roßmann, dessen Gast er sei, der ihn hergebracht habe und der jeden bestrafen werde, der ihn anzurühren wagen würde. Im übrigen müsse er auch deshalb auf den Karl Roßmann warten, weil ihm dieser Geld versprochen habe und es nur holen gegangen sei. Achten Sie bitte darauf, Frau Oberköchin: Geld ver- sprochen habe und es holen gegangen sei. Du kannst auch acht geben Roßmann"", sagte der Oberkellner nebenbei zu Karl, der sich gerade nach Terese umge- dreht hatte, die wie gebannt den Oberkellner anstarrte, und die immer wieder entweder irgendwelche Haare aus der Stirn strich oder diese Handbewegung um ihrer selbst willen machte. „Aber vielleicht erinnere ich Dich an irgendwelche Verpflichtungen. Der Mann unten hat nämlich weiterhin gesagt, daß ihr beide nach Deiner Rückkunf einen Nachtbesuch bei irgendeiner Sängerin machen werdet, deren Namen allerdings niemand ver- standen hat, da ihn der Mann immer nur unter Gesang aussprechen konnte.""","""Go,"" said the head waiter to Bess, who immediately ran away. And then to the head cook: ""The thing is, the head porter didn't hold the boy down there for fun. Because down in the lifboys' dormitory is a bed a complete stranger, very drunk, was found carefully covered up. Of course, they woke him up and wanted to take him away. But then this man started making a big racket, kept shouting that the dormitory belonged to Karl Roßmann, whose guest he was, who brought him here and who will punish anyone who dared to touch him. Besides, he had to wait for Karl Roßmann because he had promised him money and had only gone to get it. Please pay attention, Madam Head Cook: money I promised and went to get it. You can also be careful, Roßmann,"" the head waiter said casually to Karl, who had just turned to Terese, who was staring spellbound at the head waiter rte, and who kept either brushing some hair from her forehead or making this hand gesture for her own sake. ""But maybe I'll remind you of some obligations. The man downstairs also said that after your return you two would pay a night visit to some singer, whose name no one understood, since the man could only pronounce it while singing.""","‘Go on,’ said the Head Waiter to Bess, who scurried off. And then, to the Head Cook: ‘The thing is this. The Head Porter hasn’t been detaining the boy for the fun of it. A stranger has been found down in the lift-boys’ dormitory, heavily intoxicated, and carefully wrapped up in one of the beds. He was of course woken up and an attempt was made to remove him. But then the fellow started to make a great racket, and kept shouting that the dormitory belonged to Karl Rossmann, whose guest he was, who had brought him there and would punish anyone who dared to lay a finger on him. He had to wait for Karl Rossmann now because he had promised him money, and had just gone to get it. Mark this, Head Cook : Promised him money and had just gone to get it. You pay attention too, Rossmann,’ said the Head Waiter in an aside to Karl, who had just turned to Therese, who was staring spellbound at the Head Waiter, and kept brushing some hair off her brow, or was at least making as if to do so. ‘But perhaps I can remind you of some further commitments of yours. The man downstairs went on to say that, following your return, the two of you would be going on to pay a night visit to some singer or other, whose name unfortunately no one could make out, as the man would insist on singing it.’","“Yes, go,” said the head waiter to Bess, who ran off at once. Then he said to the head cook: “This is how things stand: the head porter has not detained that boy merely for the fun of it. Downstairs in the lift boys’ dormitory a complete stranger was found lying in one of the beds, heavily intoxicated, with the covers pulled up carefully over him. They woke him, of course, and wanted to get rid of him. But the man made quite a racket and kept shouting out that the dormitory belonged to Karl Rossmann, that he was a guest of Karl Rossmann, who had brought him there and would punish anyone who dared to lay hands on him. Besides, he would have to wait for that fellow Karl Rossmann, he said, for he had promised him money and had just gone to get it. Please take careful note of this, Madame Head Cook: he promised him money and went to get it. Rossmann, you too should take note of this,” the head waiter said to Karl, who had just turned toward Therese; she in turn stared at the head porter, as if spellbound, and pulled her hair back from her forehead, perhaps simply as an automatic gesture. “But perhaps I ought to remind you of certain appointments you’ve made. You see, the man downstairs went on to say that when you return, you two will pay a nighttime visit to a certain female singer, whose name no one could understand since the man could pronounce it only when he was singing.”"
"„Wer ist auf dem Gang?"" ertönte Klaras Stimme und man sah sie aus einer nahen Tür sich vorbeugen, eine große Tischlampe mit rotem Schirm in der Hand. Der Diener eilte zu ihr hin und erstattete die Meldung, Karl gieng ihm langsam nach. „Sie kommen spät"", sagte Kla- ra. Ohne ihr vorläufig zu antworten, sagte Karl zum Diener leise, aber, da er seine Natur schon kannte, im Ton strengen Befehles: „Sie warten auf mich knapp vor dieser Tür!"" „Ich wollte schon schlafen gehn"", sagte Klara und stellte die Lampe auf den Tisch. Wie unten im Speisezimmer schloß auch hier wieder der Diener vor- sichtig von außen die Tür. „Es ist ja schon halb zwölf vorüber."" „Halb zwölf vorüber"", wiederholte Karl fra- gend, wie erschrocken über diese Zahlen.","""Who is in the corridor?"" came Klara's voice and you could see her leaning out of a nearby door, a large table lamp with a red shade in her hand. The servant hurried over to her and reported the message, Karl followed him slowly. "" You're late,"" said Klara. Without answering her for the time being, Karl said to the servant softly, but since he already knew his nature, in a tone of strict command: ""You're waiting for me just outside this door!"" ""I wanted to go to bed already,"" said Klara and put the lamp on the table. As in the dining room below, the servant carefully closed the door from outside. ""It's already past eleven-thirty."" ""It's past eleven-thirty,"" Karl repeated questioningly, how shocked he was at these numbers.","‘Who’s that in the corridor?’ Klara’s voice inquired, and she appeared leaning out of a nearby doorway, with a large table-lamp with a red shade in her hand. The servant rushed over to report to her, Karl dawdled along in his wake. ‘You’re late,’ said Klara. Without answering her for the moment, Karl said to the servant quietly, but, now knowing something of his character, in tones of strict command: ‘You’re to wait for me outside!’ ‘I was just going to bed,’ said Klara, putting the lamp down on the table. As he had downstairs with the dining-room door, the servant carefully closed the door from outside. ‘It’s gone half past eleven.’ ‘Gone half past eleven,’ Karl repeated doubtfully, as though alarmed by the numbers.","“Who’s in the corridor,” Klara’s voice rang out, and one could see her leaning from a nearby door, holding a large table lamp covered with a red shade. The servant rushed over to her and reported the news; Karl followed him slowly. “You’re late,” said Klara. Refraining from answering just now, Karl said to the servant in a tone of voice that was soft but also, given his character, commanding: “You shall wait for me right by this door!” “I was about to go to sleep,” said Klara, putting the lamp on the table. Just as he had done in the dining room, the servant closed the door carefully from the outside. “It’s already after eleven-thirty.” “After eleven-thirty,” Karl repeated quizzically, as if shocked by these figures."
"Klara war schon wieder eingetreten, die Hände an ih- rer festen Frisur, als es Karl einfiel, daß er den Diener doch nicht hätte wegschicken sollen, denn wer würde ihn jetzt zur Station der Stadtbahn führen? Nun, da würde wohl schon Herr Pollunder einen Diener noch aufreiben können, vielleicht war übrigens dieser Diener ins Speisezimmer gerufen worden und würde dann zur Verfügung stehn. „Ich bitte Sie also doch ein wenig zu spielen. Man hört hier so selten Musik, daß man sich keine Gelegenheit sie zu hören, entgehen lassen will."" Dann ist aber höchste Zeit"", sagte Karl ohne weitere Überlegung und setzte sich gleich zum Klavier. „Wollen Sie Noten haben?"" fragte Klara. „Danke, ich kann ja Noten nicht einmal vollkommen lesen"", antwortete Karl und spielte schon. Es war ein kleines Lied, das wie Karl wohl wußte ziemlich langsam hatte gespielt werden müssen, um besonders für Fremde auch nur verständlich zu sein, aber er hudelte es im ärgsten Marschtempo hin- unter. Nach der Beendigung fuhr die gestörte Stille des Hauses wie in großem Gedränge wieder an ihren Platz. Man saß wie benommen da und rührte sich nicht. „Ganz schön"", sagte Klara, aber es gab keine Höflichkeitsfor- mel, die Karl nach diesem Spiel hätte schmeicheln kön- nen. „Wie spät ist es?"" fragte er. „Dreiviertel zwölf."" Dann habe ich noch ein Weilchen Zeit"", sagte er und dachte bei sich: „Entweder oder. Ich muß ja nicht alle zehn Lieder spielen, die ich kann, aber eines kann ich nach Möglichkeit gut spielen."" Und er fieng sein gelieb- tes Soldatenlied an. So langsam, daß das aufgestörte Ver- langen des Zuhörers sich nach der nächsten Note streck- te, die Karl zurückhielt und nur schwer hergab. Er muß- te ja tatsächlich wie bei jedem Lied die nötigen Tasten mit den Augen erst zusammensuchen, aber außerdem fühlte er in sich ein Leid entstehn, das über das Ende des Liedes hinaus, ein anderes Ende suchte und es nicht finden konnte. „Ich kann ja nichts"", sagte Karl nach Schluß des Liedes und sah Klara mit Tränen in den Au- gen an.","Klara had already come back in, her hands on her tight hairdo, when Karl remembered that he shouldn't have sent the servant away after all, because who would take him to the tram station now? Well, Herr Pollunder would probably still be able to grind down a servant, perhaps this servant had been called into the dining room and would then be available. ""So I'm asking you to play a little. One hears music so seldom here that one doesn't want to miss an opportunity to hear it."" Then it's high time,"" said Karl without further thought and sat down at the piano. ""Do you want sheet music?"" asked Klara. ""Thanks, I can't even read sheet music perfectly,"" answered Karl and was already playing. It was a little song that, as Karl well knew, had to be played rather slowly in order to be understandable, especially for strangers, but he shod it down at the fastest marching speed. When it was over, the disturbed silence of the house moved back into place as if in a great throng. You sat there in a daze and didn't move. ""That's nice,"" said Klara, but there wasn't a polite phrase that could have flattered Karl after this game. ""What time is it?"" asked he. ""A quarter to eleven."" Then I'll have a little time,"" he said and thought to himself: ""Either or. I don't have to play all ten songs I can, but I can play one well if I can."" And he began his beloved soldier's song. So slowly that the listener's disturbed longing stretched for the next note - te, which Karl held back and only with difficulty gave in. As with every song, he actually had to first look for the necessary keys with his eyes, but besides that he felt a sorrow arising in himself, which continued beyond the end of the song, another ""I can't do anything,"" Karl said after the song ended and looked at Klara with tears in his eyes.","Klara had come back in the meantime, her hands in her rigid coiffure, when it occurred to Karl that he shouldn’t have sent the servant away, because who would walk him to the suburban railway station now? Well, Mr Pollunder would probably be able to drum up a servant from somewhere, perhaps this very servant had been called down to the dining-room to be put at his disposal later. ‘I would like you to play something for me. We have so little music here, I don’t want to miss an opportunity of hearing some now.’ ‘Then it’s high time,’ said Karl, and without further ado he sat down at the piano. ‘Would you like some sheet music?’ asked Klara. ‘ No thank you, I can’t even read music properly,’ replied Karl, and began playing. It was a little tune, which as Karl probably knew, was meant to be played quite slowly, particularly so that foreigners could understand it, but he hammered it out as mechanically as a march. When he’d finished, the shattered silence of the house slunk back. They sat there stunned and motionless. ‘Pretty good,’ said Klara, but there was no platitude that might have comforted Karl after playing like that. ‘How late is it?’ he asked. ‘A quarter to midnight.’ ‘Then I’ve still got a bit of time,’ he said, and privately he thought: It’s either or. I don’t have to play all ten of my tunes, but there is one I can try and play nicely. And he embarked on his beloved soldier’s song. So slowly that the hearer’s alerted expectations lengthened towards the next note, which Karl would hold back as long as he could before squeezing it out. As with all his tunes, he first had to locate the notes by eye, but he also felt sorrow being born within him that sought its definition beyond the end of the song and couldn’t find it. ‘I’m no good,’ Karl said when he’d finished this time, and looked at Klara with tear-filled eyes.","Klara had already returned, holding her trim hair with both hands, when Karl realized that he should not have dismissed the servant, for who would now take him to the train station? Well, surely Mr. Pollunder could still get hold of a servant; besides, that same servant might already have been summoned to the dining room and would therefore be available. “So I’m asking you to play a little something for me. We so rarely hear music here that one doesn’t want to miss any such opportunity.” “Then it’s certainly high time,” said Karl, and without any further reflection, he sat down quickly at the piano. “Do you want some sheet music,” Klara asked. “No thanks, I cannot even read music properly,” answered Karl, and began to play. It was only a little song that, as Karl knew only too well, needed to be played very slowly if others, especially foreigners, were to understand it, but nevertheless he raced through it in the tempo of an extremely fast marching song. When it was over, the disturbed stillness returned, as if in a rush, to occupy the old house again. They sat without moving, as if in a daze. “Very nice,” said Klara, but after such a performance no polite phrase could have flattered Karl. “How late is it?” he asked. “A quarter to twelve.” “I still have a little more time,” he said, and then he thought: So it’ll have to be one or the other. While I’m certainly not obliged to play all ten songs I know, there’s one I could conceivably play well. And he began to perform his beloved soldier’s song, so slowly that the listener’s roused desire continually reached for the next note, which Karl held on to for some time and then at last released. As with every song, he first had to glance at the keys he needed, but rising within he could sense a sadness that already searched beyond the ending of the song for another ending that, however, it failed to find. “I’m simply no good,” Karl said on finishing the song, and looked at Klara with tears in his eyes."
"„Sie studieren?"" fragte Karl.","""Are you studying?"" Karl asked.",‘You’re studying?’ asked Karl.,“You’re studying?” asked Karl.
"„So hoch"", sagte er sich und wurde, wie er so gar nicht an das Weggehn dachte, von der immer mehr an- schwellenden Menge der Gepäckträger, die an ihm vorüberzogen, allmählich bis an das Bordgeländer ge- schoben.","""So high,"" he said to himself and, just as he was not even thinking of leaving, was gradually pushed up to the railing by the ever-increasing crowd of porters who were passing him.","‘So high,’ he said to himself, and quite forgetting to disembark, he found himself gradually pushed up against the railing by the massing throng of porters.","“So high,” he said to himself, and although he still had no thoughts of leaving, he found himself being pushed gradually toward the rail by an ever-swelling throng of porters."
"„Freilich ist sie eine Sängerin und eine große Sänge- rin"", antwortete Robinson, der eine große Bonbonmasse auf der Zunge wälzte und hie und da ein Stück, das aus dem Mund gedrängt wurde mit den Fingern wieder zu- rückdrückte. „Aber das wußten wir natürlich damals noch nicht, wir sahen nur daß es eine reiche und sehr feine Dame war. Sie tat, als wäre nichts geschehn und vielleicht hatte sie auch nichts gespürt, denn ich hatte sie tatsächlich nur mit den Fingerspitzen angetippt. Aber immerfort hat sie den Delamarche angesehn, der ihr wie- der – wie er das schon trif – gerade in die Augen zu- rückgeschaut hat. Darauf hat sie zu ihm gesagt: ‚Komm mal auf ein Weilchen herein' und hat mit dem Sonnen- schirm in die Wohnung gezeigt, wohin Delamarche ihr vorangehn sollte. Dann sind sie beide hineingegangen und die Dienerschaf hat hinter ihnen die Türe zuge- macht. Mich haben sie draußen vergessen und da habe ich gedacht es wird nicht gar so lange dauern und habe mich auf die Treppe gesetzt, um Delamarche zu erwar- ten. Aber statt des Delamarche ist der Diener herausge- kommen und hat mir eine ganze Schüssel Suppe heraus- gebracht, ‚eine Aufmerksamkeit des Delamarche!' sagte ich mir. Der Diener blieb noch während ich aß ein Weil- chen bei mir stehn und erzählte mir Einiges über Brunel- da und da habe ich gesehn, was für eine Bedeutung der Besuch bei Brunelda für uns haben konnte. Denn Bru- nelda war eine geschiedene Frau, hatte ein großes Ver- mögen und war vollständig selbstständig. Ihr früherer Mann ein Cacaofabrikant liebte sie zwar noch immer, aber sie wollte von ihm nicht das geringste hören. Er kam sehr of in die Wohnung, immer sehr elegant wie zu einer Hochzeit angezogen – das ist Wort für Wort wahr, ich kenne ihn selbst – aber der Diener wagte trotz der größten Bestechung nicht Brunelda zu fragen, ob sie ihn empfangen wollte, denn er hatte einigemal schon gefragt, und immer hatte ihm Brunelda das was sie gerade bei der Hand hatte ins Gesicht geworfen. Einmal sogar ihre gro- ße gefüllte Wärmeflasche und mit der hatte sie ihm einen Vorderzahn ausgeschlagen. Ja, Roßmann da schaust Du!""","""Of course she is a singer and a great singer,"" replied Robinson, rolling a large mass of candy on his tongue and now and then pushing back with his fingers a piece that was pushed out of his mouth. ""But you knew that Of course we didn't at the time, we only saw that it was a rich and very fine lady. She acted as if nothing had happened and maybe she hadn't felt anything either, because I had actually only touched her with my fingertips. But she kept doing it She looked at Delamarche, who – as he already does – looked straight back at her, whereupon she said to him: 'Come in for a while' and pointed to the apartment with the parasol where Delamarche was supposed to go before her. Then they both went in and the servants closed the door behind them. They forgot about me outside and I thought it wouldn't take that long and sat down on the stairs to Expecting Delamarche. But instead of Delamarche, the servant came out and brought me a whole bowl of soup, 'Delamarche's attention!' I said to myself. The servant stayed with me for a while while I ate and told me a few things about Brunelda, and then I saw what significance a visit to Brunelda could have for us. Because Brunelda was a divorced woman, had a large fortune and was completely self-employed. Her former husband, a cacao manufacturer, still loved her, but she didn't want to hear anything from him. He came to the apartment very often, always dressed very elegantly, as if for a wedding - that's true word for word, I know him myself - but the servant, despite the greatest bribe, didn't dare ask Brunelda if she wanted to see him, for he had asked several times, and Brunelda had always thrown what she had at hand in his face. Once even her big filled hot water bottle and with that she had knocked out a front tooth. Yes, Roßmann, there you are looking!""","‘Of course she’s a singer, and a great singer too,’ replied Robinson, revolving a huge mass of sweets on his tongue and now and then pushing a bit that was falling out of his mouth back in with his fingers. ‘But of course we didn’t know that then, we only saw that she was a rich and very distinguished lady. She acted as though nothing had happened, because I really only just tapped her with my fingertips. But she kept staring at Delamarche, who looked her – how does he manage it – straight in the eye. Then she said: “Come in for a bit,” and with her parasol she ushered Delamarche into the apartment ahead of her. Then they both went inside and the servants shut the door after them. They just left me outside, and I thought it won’t take all that long, and I sat down on the steps to wait for Delamarche. Then instead of Delamarche the butler came out and he brought me a whole bowl of soup, “compliments of Delamarche!” I thought to myself. The butler hung around for a while as I ate, and told me a few things about Brunelda, and then I saw what importance the visit to Brunelda could have for us. Because Brunelda was a divorcee, she had a large fortune, and she was completely independent. Her ex-husband, a chocolate manufacturer, still loved her, but she didn’t want anything more to do with him. He visited the apartment frequently, always dressed terribly smartly, as if for a wedding – that’s literally true, I saw him myself – but in spite of all kinds of bribes, the butler didn’t dare ask Brunelda whether she would receive him, because he had already asked a few times, and each time she had thrown in his face whatever she had to hand. Once it was even her large full hot-water bottle, and that knocked out one of his front teeth. Yes, Rossmann, you’re amazed.’","“Of course she’s a singer, a great singer,” answered Robinson, rolling a mass of candy on his tongue and now and then using his fingers to push in a piece that his mouth had ejected. “Of course at the time we didn’t know yet; we could only see she was a rich lady and a very elegant one too. She acted as if nothing had happened and may indeed not have felt a thing, since I had really only touched her with my fingertips. But she kept on looking at Delamarche, who in turn gazed straight into her eyes—as only he is capable of doing. Then she said, ‘Come in for a bit,’ motioning to Delamarche with her parasol that he should lead the way into the apartment. The two went in, and the servants closed the door behind them. They forgot me outside, and at first I thought it wouldn’t take so long and sat there on the steps waiting for Delamarche. But it was not Delamarche but the servant who came out, bringing me a dish of soup filled to the brim; ‘Courtesy of Delamarche!’ I said to myself. The servant stayed with me for a moment as I ate and told me a few things about Brunelda and then I could see what this visit to Brunelda’s might mean for us. For Brunelda was a divorced woman, had a large fortune and was completely independent. Though her former husband, a cocoa manufacturer, still loved her, she didn’t want to have anything to do with him anymore. He often came to the apartment, always very elegantly dressed, as if for a wedding—this is all absolutely true, I know him personally—but despite the biggest bribes, the servant wouldn’t dare ask Brunelda whether she would receive him, for he had already asked several times, and Brunelda had always taken whatever she had at hand and thrown it in his face. Once she happened to grab her large filled hot-water bottle and knocked out one of his front teeth with it. Yes, Rossmann, imagine that!”"
"Im Hotel wurde Karl gleich in eine Art Bureau geführt, in welchem die Oberköchin ein Vormerkbuch in der Hand einer jungen Schreibmaschinistin einen Brief in die Schreibmaschine diktierte. Das äußerst präcise Dik- tieren, der beherrschte und elastische Tastenschlag jag- ten an dem nur hie und da merklichen Ticken der Wand- uhr vorüber, die schon fast halb zwölf Uhr zeigte. „So!"" sagte die Oberköchin, klappte das Vormerkbuch zu, die Schreibmaschinistin sprang auf und stülpte den Holz- deckel über die Maschine, ohne bei dieser mechanischen Arbeit die Augen von Karl zu lassen. Sie sah noch wie ein Schulmädchen aus, ihre Schürze war sehr sorgfältig gebügelt, auf den Achseln z. B. gewellt, die Frisur recht hoch und man staunte ein wenig wenn man nach diesen Einzelnheiten ihr ernstes Gesicht sah. Nach Verbeueun- gen zuerst gegen die Oberköchin, dann gegen Karl ent- fernte sie sich und Karl sah unwillkürlich die Oberkö- chin mit einem fragenden Blicke an.","In the hotel, Karl was taken straight to a kind of office, where the head cook, holding a note book in the hands of a young typewriter, dictated a letter into the typewriter. The extremely precise dictation, the controlled and elastic keystroke chased past the ticking of the wall clock, which was only noticeable here and there, and which showed almost half past eleven. ""So!"" said the head cook, shut the note book, the typewriter jumped up and put the wooden cover over the machine, without taking her eyes off Karl during this mechanical work. She still looked like a schoolgirl, her apron was very carefully ironed, wavy on the armpits, for example, the hairstyle quite high and one was a little amazed when one saw her serious face after these details.After bowing first to the head cook, then to Karl, she walked away and Karl involuntarily looked at the head cook with a questioning look.","On reaching the hotel, Karl was taken straightaway to a kind of office, where the Head Cook, holding a notebook in her hand, was dictating a letter to a young typist. Her very precise dictation, the subdued and elastic tapping of the keys overtook the intermittently audible ticking of a clock on the wall, which now indicated almost half past eleven. ‘There!’ said the Head Cook, and she snapped the notebook shut. The typist leapt to her feet, and draped the wooden lid over the typewriter, without taking her eyes off Karl as she performed this mechanical action. She looked like a schoolgirl still, her apron for example had been very carefully ironed, with little ruches on the shoulders, her hair was piled up on her head, and after such particulars it was quite a surprise to come upon the serious expression on her face. First bowing to the Head Cook, and then to Karl, she left the room, and Karl involuntarily looked inquiringly at the Head Cook.","At the hotel Karl was led at once into some kind of office, where the head cook stood, notebook in hand, dictating a letter to a young typist. Her extremely precise dictation and the controlled and elastic pounding of the keys raced past the only intermittently audible ticking of the clock, which indicated that it was already twelve o’clock. “Well!” said the head cook; she closed her notebook, and the typist jumped up and pulled the wooden case over the machine without taking her eyes off Karl as she went about this routine task. She still looked like a schoolgirl; her apron had been very carefully ironed and, for instance, even had ruffles at the shoulders; her hairdo went up very high, and after noting these details, one was slightly surprised to see her serious face. After first bowing to the head cook, then to Karl, she went off, and Karl involuntarily gave the head cook a searching glance."
"„Sie, junger Mann"", hörte sich Karl plötzlich ange- sprochen, „könnten Sie sich nicht anderswo aufstellen? Ihr Herüberstarren stört mich schrecklich. Um zwei Uhr in der Nacht kann man doch schließlich verlangen, auf dem Balkon ungestört arbeiten zu können. Wollen Sie denn etwas von mir?""","""You, young man,"" Karl suddenly heard himself spoken to, ""couldn't you stand somewhere else? Your staring at me terribly bothers me. After all, at two o'clock in the morning one can demand to be able to work undisturbed on the balcony. Want to you something from me?""","‘You, young man,’ Karl suddenly heard himself being addressed, ‘couldn’t you go somewhere else? You’re bothering me no end, the way you’re standing and staring at me. It’s two in the morning: surely it’s not too much to ask, to be allowed to study in peace on my own balcony. Is there something you want from me?’","“You there, young man,” Karl heard a voice addressing him all of a sudden, “couldn’t you stand somewhere else? It’s terribly disturbing, how you keep staring over at me. At two o’clock at night one can surely expect to be able to work on the balcony without being disturbed. Do you want anything from me?”"
"Karl hatte nicht viel Zeit alles anzusehn, denn bald trat ein Diener auf sie zu und fragte den Heizer mit einem Blick, als gehöre er nicht hierher, was er denn wolle. Der Heizer antwortete so leise als er gefragt wur- de, er wolle mit dem Herrn Oberkassier reden. Der Diener lehnte für seinen Teil mit einer Handbewegung diese Bitte ab, gieng aber dennoch auf den Fußspitzen dem runden Tisch im großen Bogen ausweichend zu dem Herrn mit den Folianten. Dieser Herr, das sah man deutlich, erstarrte geradezu unter den Worten des Dieners, sah sich aber endlich nach dem Manne um, der ihn zu sprechen wünschte, fuchtelte dann streng ab- wehrend gegen den Heizer und der Sicherheit halber auch gegen den Diener hin. Der Diener kehrte darauf- hin zum Heizer zurück und sagte in einem Tone, als vertraue er ihm etwas an: „Scheren Sie sich sofort aus dem Zimmer!""","Karl didn't have much time to look at everything, because soon a servant came up to them and, looking as if he didn't belong here, asked the stoker what he wanted. The stoker answered so quietly when he was asked that he wanted to speak to the chief cashier. For his part, the servant declined this request with a wave of his hand, but nevertheless walked on tiptoe, avoiding the round table in a wide arc to the gentleman with the folios. This gentleman, one could clearly see, froze under the servant's words, but finally looked around for the man who wished to speak to him, then waved his hands at the stoker and, to be on the safe side, at the servant as well. The servant then returned to the stoker and said in a tone as if he were confiding in him: ""Get out of the room at once!""","Karl had little time to take in all of this, because a servant soon approached the stoker and, frowning, as though he didn’t belong there, asked him what he was doing. The stoker replied, as quietly as he could, that he wanted a word with the chief cashier. The servant declined this wish with a movement of his hand but, nevertheless, on the tips of his toes, and giving the round table a wide berth, went up to the man with the ledgers. The man – it was quite evident – froze at the servant’s words, then finally turned to face the man who wanted to speak to him, but only in order to make a vehement gesture of refusal to the stoker, and then, to be on the safe side, to the servant as well. Whereupon the servant went back to the stoker and in a confiding sort of tone said: ‘Now get the hell out of here!’","Karl had little time to gaze at everything, for before long an attendant approached them, looked at the stoker as though he did not belong there, and asked him what he wanted. Responding as softly as he had been asked, the stoker said that he wished to speak to the chief bursar. The attendant dismissed this request with a wave of his hand, but nonetheless, tiptoeing in a wide arc around the circular table, he approached the gentleman beside the folios. At last that gentleman, who, as one could see quite clearly, almost froze on hearing the attendant’s words, looked around at the man who wished to speak to him, dismissed the stoker with a vehement gesture and, just to be sure, the attendant likewise. The latter returned to the stoker and, as if imparting a confidence, said: “Get out at once!”"
"„Aber ich halte Sie hier auf"", rief sie dann. „Und Sie sind gewiß sehr müde und wir können auch alles viel besser bei Tag besprechen. Die Freude einen Landsmann getroffen zu haben, macht ganz gedankenlos. Kommen Sie, ich werde Sie in Ihr Zimmer führen."" „Ich habe noch eine Bitte Frau Oberköchin"", sagte Karl im An- blick des Telephonkastens der auf einem Tische stand. Es ist möglich, daß mir morgen, vielleicht sehr früh, meine frühern Kameraden eine Photographie bringen, die ich dringend brauche. Wären Sie so freundlich und würden Sie dem Portier telephonieren, er möchte die Leute zu mir schicken oder mich holen lassen."" „Ge- wiß"", sagte die Oberköchin, „aber würde es nicht genü- gen, wenn er ihnen die Photographie abnimmt? Was ist es denn für eine Photographie, wenn man fragen darf?"" Es ist die Photographie meiner Eltern"", sagte Karl, nein ich muß mit den Leuten selbst sprechen."" Die Oberköchin sagte nichts weiter und gab telephonisch in die Portiersloge den entsprechenden Befehl, wobei sie","""But I'll keep you here,"" she then called out. ""And I'm sure you're very tired and we can discuss everything much better during the day. The joy of having met a compatriot makes you completely thoughtless. Come on, I'll take you in run your room."" ""I have one more request, Frau Oberkochin,"" said Karl, looking at the telephone box that was standing on a table. It's possible that tomorrow, perhaps very early, my former comrades will bring me a photograph that I urgently need. Would you be kindly and would you telephone the porter and he would like to send the people to me or have me fetched."" ""Certainly,"" said the head cook, ""but wouldn't it be enough if he took the photograph from them? What kind of photograph is it, if I may ask?"" It's the photograph of my parents,"" said Karl, no, I have to talk to the people myself."" The head cook said nothing more and gave the appropriate order by telephone into the porter's box, whereby she","‘But you mustn’t let me detain you,’ she cried. ‘I expect you’re very tired, and we can talk about everything much better in the daytime. My delight at meeting a fellow countryman has made me quite inconsiderate. Come on, I’ll take you to your room.’ ‘I have another favour I’d like to ask you, cook,’ said Karl, looking at the telephone apparatus on the table. ‘It is possible that tomorrow, perhaps very early, my former companions may bring in a photograph that I need urgently. Would you be so kind and telephone the porter to send them up to me, or have me brought down to them.’ ‘Of course,’ said the Head Cook, ‘but wouldn’t it do if he just took receipt of the photograph? What is the photograph of, if I may ask?’ ‘It’s a photograph of my parents,’ said Karl, ‘but no, I need to talk to them myself. The cook made no reply, and telephoned the porter’s lodge with the instructions, giving Karl’s room number as 536.","“But I’m detaining you here,” she cried. “You must be very tired, and besides, we can discuss everything much better in the daytime. One’s joy at meeting a fellow countryman can make one quite heedless. Come, I shall take you to your room.” “I do have one other request, Madame Head Cook,” said Karl, espying a telephone stand on a nearby table. “It’s possible that tomorrow, perhaps even at a very early hour, my former companions will bring me a photograph that I urgently need. Could you kindly telephone the porter and ask that he either send those people to me or have someone get me?” “Certainly,” said the head cook, “but wouldn’t it suffice if he took the photograph from them? Besides, what kind of photograph is it, if you don’t mind my asking?” “It’s a photograph of my parents,” said Karl, “no, I must speak to those people in person.” The head cook, who did not answer, relayed the appropriate order over the telephone to the porter’s lodge, referring to Karl’s room as number 536."
"„Delamarche"", rief Brunelda, „komm mich doch we- nigstens abtrocknen. Die zwei finden ja das Parfüm doch nicht und bringen nur alles in Unordnung. Sie sollen sofort mit dem Suchen aufören. Aber gleich! Und alles aus der Hand legen! Und nichts mehr anrühren! Sie möchten wohl aus der Wohnung einen Stall machen. Nimm sie beim Kragen Delamarche, wenn sie nicht auf- hören! Aber sie arbeiten ja noch immer, gerade ist eine Schachtel gefallen. Sie sollen sie nicht mehr aufeben, alles liegen lassen und aus dem Zimmer heraus! Riegel hinter ihnen die Tür zu und komm zu mir. Ich liege ja schon viel zu lange im Wasser, die Beine habe ich schon ganz kalt.""","""Delamarche,"" cried Brunelda, ""at least come and dry me off. The two of them can't find the perfume after all and they're just making a mess of everything. You're supposed to stop looking right away. But right away! And put everything down! And Don't touch anything anymore! They probably want to turn the apartment into a stable. Take them by the collar, Delamarche, if they don't stop! But they're still working, a box has just fallen. They shouldn't pick it up any more, leave everything lying around and get out of the room! Bolt the door behind them and come to me. I've been lying in the water for far too long, my legs are already quite cold.""","‘Delamarche!’ cried Brunelda, ‘come and dry me at least. Those two won’t manage to find the perfume, and will only make a mess. Tell them to stop looking. Right away! And put everything down! And not touch anything! They’ll turn our apartment into a pigsty. Grab hold of them Delamarche, if they don’t stop! But they’re still at it , I heard a box falling. They’re not to pick it up, leave everything where it is, and just get out of the room! Bolt the door behind them, and come back to me. I’ve been lying in the water far too long already, my legs are getting quite cold.’","“Delamarche, come here,” cried Brunelda, “and at least make an effort to dry me off. Those two certainly won’t find the perfume and are making a complete mess of everything. They should stop looking right away. This instant! And they must drop everything. And not touch anything else! They sure seem to want to turn this apartment into a barn. Delamarche, grab them by the collar if they don’t stop! But they’re still at it—a box has just fallen down out there. They shouldn’t pick it up but simply leave everything as it is and get out of the room! Then latch the door after them and come to me. I’ve lain in this water too long, my legs are chilly.”"
"Diese Rede büßte man überdies damit, daß jetzt der Weg zur Bahn im Laufschritt gemacht werden mußte. Das war aber auch nicht sehr schwer, denn – Karl be- merkte es erst jetzt – niemand trug ein Gepäckstück – das einzige Gepäckstück war eigentlich der Kinderwa- gen, der jetzt an der Spitze der Truppe vom Vater ge- lenkt wie haltlos auf und nieder sprang. Was für besitz- lose verdächtige Leute waren hier zusammengekommen und wurden doch so gut empfangen und behütet! Und dem Transportleiter mußten sie geradezu ans Herz ge- legt sein. Bald faßte er selbst mit einer Hand die Lenk- stange des Kinderwagens und erhob die andere um die Truppe aufzumuntern, bald war er hinter der letzten Reihe, die er antrieb, bald lief er an den Seiten entlang, faßte einzelne langsamere aus der Mitte ins Auge und suchte ihnen mit schwingenden Armen darzustellen, wie sie laufen müßten.","Moreover, this speech was atoned for by the fact that the way to the station now had to be made at a run. But that wasn't very difficult either, because – Karl noticed it only now – no one was carrying a piece of luggage – the only piece of luggage was actually the pram, which was now at the head of the troupe being driven up and down by his father as if he couldn't hold his ground jumped. What propertyless suspects had gathered here and were so well received and cared for! And they must have been highly recommended to the transport manager. Now he was grasping the handlebars of the pram himself with one hand and raising the other to encourage the troupe, now he was behind the last row he was pushing, now he was running along the sides, eyeing a few slower ones in the middle and tried to show them with swinging arms how they ought to run.","The comeuppance for the speech was that they now needed to run to the station. That wasn’t very difficult, though, for – Karl only noticed it now – no one had any luggage – really the only luggage was the pram, which, pushed along by the father at the head of the column, bounced wildly up and down. Suspicious, unpropertied people had assembled here, and had been so well received and looked after! And the head of transport in particular was so involved. At one moment he was helping to push the pram with one hand, while raising the other to exhort the recruits, at the next he was behind the last of the stragglers, driving them on, the next he was running down the flanks, fixing some of the slower ones in the middle with his eye, and by waving his arm, demonstrating to them how they should be running.","The price they paid for this speech was that they now had to run to reach the station. Still, this wasn’t terribly difficult, for as Karl only now noticed, no one was carrying any luggage and indeed the only piece of luggage was the baby carriage that the father pushed along at the head of the troupe and that bounced up and down as if careening along of its own accord. What suspect types, without possessions, had found their way here, and yet they were being so well received and cared for! And they must have made quite an impression on the transportation manager. For he seized the handlebars of the baby carriage with one hand, raising the other up in the air so as to persuade the group to move forward; now he appeared behind the last line, driving them on; now he ran along the sides, keeping an eye on some of the slower ones in the middle, and tried to show them how to run by swinging his arms."
Es mußte wohl eine entlegene …,It must have been a remote...,"The automobile came to a stop in what appeared to be a remote suburban street, because all around there was silence, children squatted on the edge of the pavement playing, a man with a lot of old clothes over his shoulders called up watchfully to the windows of the houses, Karl felt uncomfortably tired as he climbed out of the car on to the asphalt, on which the morning sun was shining warmly and brightly.","The suburban street in which the automobile halted must have been quite remote, for there was not a sound to be heard anywhere; on the curb children sat playing; a man with a large bundle of old clothes strung over his shoulders had his eyes fixed on the windows of the buildings as he shouted up; in his weariness Karl felt uncomfortable stepping from the automobile onto the asphalt, which seemed bright and warm in the morning sun."
"„Meine Herren"", wiederholte der Staatsrat, „Sie neh- men gegen meinen und gegen Ihren Willen an einer klei- nen Familienscene teil und ich kann deshalb nicht um- hin, Ihnen eine Erläuterung zu geben, da wie ich glaube nur der Herr Kapitän (diese Erwähnung hatte eine gegen- seitige Verbeugung zur Folge) vollständig unterrichtet ist.""","""Gentlemen,"" repeated the Councilor of State, ""you are taking part in a small family scene against my will and against yours, and I can therefore not help but give you an explanation, as I believe only the captain (this mention prompted a mutual bow) is fully informed.""","‘Gentlemen,’ reiterated the state councillor, ‘without your meaning to, or my meaning you to, you are here witnessing a little family scene, and I feel I owe you some explanation, seeing as only the captain here’ – an exchange of bows took place at this point – ‘is completely in the picture.’","“Gentlemen,” the state counselor repeated, “you’re taking part in a little family scene, and I owe you an explanation, since I believe that only the captain”—this remark led to an exchange of bows—“has been fully informed about this.”"
"Als sie vor ihre Wohnung kamen und Robinson ohne weiters die Hand an die Klinke legte, hielt ihn Karl zu- rück, da es doch nicht sicher war, ob sie eintreten durf- ten. „Aber ja"", sagte Robinson, „jetzt frisiert er sie ja nur."" Und tatsächlich saß in dem noch immer ungelüfe- ten und verhängten Zimmer Brunelda mit weit auseinan- dergestellten Beinen im Lehnstuhl und Delamarche, der hinter ihr stand, kämmte mit tief herabgebeugtem Ge- sicht ihr kurzes wahrscheinlich sehr verfitztes Haar. Brunelda trug wieder ein ganz loses Kleid, diesmal aber von blaßrosa Farbe, es war vielleicht ein wenig kürzer als das gestrige, wenigstens sah man die weißen grob gestrickten Strümpfe fast bis zum Knie. Ungeduldig über die lange Dauer des Kämmens, fuhr Brunelda mit der dicken roten Zunge zwischen den Lippen hin und her, manchmal riß sie sich sogar mit dem Ausruf „Aber Delamarche!"" gänzlich von Delamarche los, der mit er- hobenem Kamm ruhig wartete, bis sie den Kopf wieder zurücklegte.","When they got to her apartment and Robinson put his hand to the doorknob without further ado, Karl held him back, since it wasn't certain whether they would be allowed in. ""Oh yes,"" said Robinson, ""now he's doing his hair only her."" And indeed, in the still unaired and curtained room, Brunelda was sitting with her legs wide apart in the armchair and Delamarche, who was standing behind her, with his face bowed low, combing her short, probably very tangled, hair. Brunelda was wearing a loose dress again, but this time it was pale pink in color. It was perhaps a little shorter than yesterday, at least you could see the white, coarsely knitted stockings almost to the knee. Impatient with the length of combing, Brunelda licked her lips back and forth with her thick red tongue, sometimes even tearing herself away from Delamarche entirely, with the exclamation ""But Delamarche!"" she put her head back.","When they reached their apartment, and Robinson casually grasped the door handle, Karl held him back, since he wasn’t yet sure whether it was all right to go in. ‘ Oh yes,’ said Robinson, ‘he’s just doing her hair.’ And indeed, in the still unaired and darkened room there sat Brunelda in the armchair with her legs apart, while Delamarche stood behind her, bending low over her, combing her short and probably very tangled hair. Brunelda was wearing another of her very loose dresses, this time a pale pink one, if anything it was a little shorter than yesterday’s, at any rate you could see the coarse woven white stockings up to the knee. Impatient with the time it was taking to comb her hair, Brunelda pushed her thick red tongue between her lips this way and that, sometimes, with the exclamation ‘Oh Delamarche!’ , she even completely broke away from Delamarche, who waited with raised comb for her to lay her head back again.","When they arrived at their apartment and Robinson reached without hesitation for the door handle, Karl restrained him, for it was not clear whether they were permitted to enter. “Why, of course,” said Robinson, “he’s still doing her hair.” And Brunelda was indeed sitting in the armchair, legs spread wide apart, in the room, which had not yet been aired and in which the shutters were still closed; Delamarche, who stood behind her with his face inclined, was combing her hair, which was short and probably all tangled. Brunelda again wore a very loose-fitting dress, only this time it was light pink and perhaps a little shorter than the one she wore the day before, for one could see her coarsely woven white stockings almost as far as the knee. Having become impatient over the time it took to comb her hair, Brunelda flicked her thick red tongue between her lips; from time to time she cried, “ But Delamarche!” and tore herself away from Delamarche, who waited quietly, comb raised in the air, for her to lower her head again."
"„Nein"", sagte Karl, „ich gehe bestimmt weg und wo- möglich noch heute abend. Ich bleibe nicht bei Euch.""","""No,"" said Karl, ""I'll definitely go away, possibly even this evening. I won't stay with you.""","‘No,’ said Karl, ‘I’m definitely leaving, tonight if possible. I’m not staying with you.’","“No,” said Karl, “I’m leaving, possibly even this evening. I’m not staying with you.”"
"„Nur meinen Koffer fürchte ich verloren zu – "". Und damit erinnerte er sich an alles, was geschehen war und was noch zu tun übrig blieb, sah sich um und erblickte alle Anwesenden stumm vor Achtung und Staunen auf ihren frühern Plätzen, die Augen auf ihn gerichtet. Nur den Hafenbeamten sah man, soweit ihre strengen selbst- zufriedenen Gesichter einen Einblick gestatteten, das Bedauern an, zu so ungelegener Zeit gekommen zu sein und die Taschenuhr die sie jetzt vor sich liegen hatten, war ihnen wahrscheinlich wichtiger als alles was im Zimmer vorgieng und vielleicht noch geschehen konnte. Der erste welcher nach dem Kapitän seine Anteilnah- me aussprach, war merkwürdigerweise der Heizer. „Ich gratuliere Ihnen herzlich"", sagte er und schüttelte Karl die Hand, womit er auch etwas wie Anerkennung aus- drücken wollte. Als er sich dann mit der gleichen An- sprache auch an den Senator wenden wollte, trat dieser jedoch zurück, als überschreite der Heizer damit seine Rechte; der Heizer ließ auch sofort ab.","""Only I fear losing my suitcase to - "". And with that he remembered everything that had happened and what still remained to be done, looked around and saw all those present mute in respect and amazement in their former places, eyes open Only the port officials, as far as their stern, self-satisfied faces permitted, showed regret at having come at such an inconvenient time, and the pocket watch they now had before them was probably more important to them than anything in the Zimmer went ahead and perhaps could still happen. Strangely enough, the first to express his sympathy after the captain was the stoker. ""I congratulate you warmly,"" he said and shook Karl's hand, which he also wanted to express something like appreciation . When he then wanted to address the senator with the same speech, however, the latter stepped back as if the stoker were overstepping his rights; the stoker also stopped immediately.","‘Only I’m afraid I may have lost my suitcase –’ and with that he suddenly remembered all that had taken place, and all that still remained to be done, and looked around at all those present, standing in silent respect and astonishment. None of them had moved and all were looking at him. Only in the port officials, inasmuch as their stern and self-satisfied faces told one anything, could one see regret that they had come at such an unsuitable time; the wristwatch they had laid out in front of them was probably more important to them than anything that had happened, and that might yet happen, in the room. The first man, after the captain, to express his pleasure was, extraordinarily, the stoker. ‘ Hearty congratulations,’ he said and shook Karl by the hand, also wanting to show something like admiration. But when he approached the Senator with the same words, the latter took a step back, as though the stoker had taken things too far, and he stopped right away.","“But as for my trunk, I’m afraid I’ve lost . . .” And just then it all came back to him, everything that had happened and everything that still needed to be done, and looking about him, he saw that every person in the room still stood in the same position, silent in astonishment and respect, with their eyes fixed on him. Only in the harbor officials could one see—insofar as their severe, complacent faces revealed anything whatsoever—that they regretted having come at such an inconvenient moment and indeed they showed greater interest in the watch lying in front of them than in anything going on in that room and in anything that might still go on there. Oddly enough, the first person after the captain to express his good wishes was the stoker. “My heartfelt congratulations,” and he shook Karl’s hand, thereby seeking to convey something akin to appreciation also. Yet when he subsequently attempted to address the same words to the senator, the latter withdrew as if the stoker had overstepped his bounds; the stoker immediately desisted."
"Natürlich war das Lernen des Englischen Karls erste und wichtigste Aufgabe. Ein junger Professor einer Handelshochschule erschien morgens um sieben Uhr in Karls Zimmer und fand ihn schon an seinem Schreib- tisch bei den Hefen sitzen oder memorierend im Zim- mer auf und ab gehn. Karl sah wohl ein daß zur Aneig- nung des Englischen keine Eile groß genug sei und daß er hier außerdem die beste Gelegenheit habe seinem On- kel eine außerordentliche Freude durch rasche Fort- schritte zu machen. Und tatsächlich gelang es bald, wäh- rend zuerst das Englische in den Gesprächen mit dem Onkel sich auf Gruß und Abschiedsworte beschränkt hatte, immer größere Teile der Gespräche ins Englische hinüberzuspielen, wodurch gleichzeitig vertraulichere Temen sich einzustellen begannen. Das erste amerika- nische Gedicht, die Darstellung einer Feuersbrunst, das Karl seinem Onkel an einem Abend recitieren konnte, machte diesen tiefernst vor Zufriedenheit. Sie standen damals beide an einem Fenster in Karls Zimmer, der Onkel sah hinaus, wo alle Helligkeit des Himmels schon vergangen war und schlug im Mitgefühl der Verse lang- sam und gleichmäßig in die Hände, während Karl auf- recht neben ihm stand und mit starren Augen das schwierige Gedicht sich entrang.","Of course, learning English was Karl's first and most important task. A young professor from a business school appeared in Karl's room at seven in the morning and found him already sitting at his desk with the yeast or pacing up and down the room, memorizing. Karl saw that there was no hurry to learn English and that he also had the best opportunity to make his uncle extremely happy by making rapid progress. And in fact it soon succeeded, while at first the English in the conversations with the uncle was limited to greetings and parting words, more and more parts of the conversations were played over into English, whereby more confidential topics began to appear at the same time. The first American poem, depicting a conflagration, that Karl was able to recite to his uncle in one evening, made him grave with contentment. At that time they were both standing at a window in Karl's room, the uncle looked out from where all the brightness of the sky had already faded and slowly and evenly clapped his hands in the sympathy of the verses, while Karl stood upright next to him and stared at me eyes the difficult poem escaped.","But naturally Karl’s first and most important task was learning English. A young teacher from a trade school would appear in Karl’s room at seven in the morning, to find him already seated at his desk, among his notebooks, or else walking up and down the room, committing something to memory. Karl understood that he couldn’t learn English quickly enough, and that his rapid progress at it was also his best way of pleasing his uncle. At first the English content of his early conversations with his uncle had been confined to hello and goodbye, but he was soon able to increase the English portion of their conversations, and also to move on to more personal subjects. The first time Karl recited an American poem to his uncle one evening – the subject of it was a conflagration – it made him quite sombre with satisfaction. They both stood by a window in Karl’s room, the uncle looked out into the darkened sky, and in sympathy with the verse, he slowly and rhythmically clapped his hands, while Karl stood beside him with expressionless eyes and struggled with the difficult poem.","Learning English was, of course, Karl’s first and most important task. When the young teacher from a business school appeared in Karl’s room at seven o’clock each morning, he would find him already seated at his desk, poring over his notebooks or walking up and down, committing phrases to memory. Karl realized that when it came to learning English, there could be no such thing as excessive haste, and that the best way to give his uncle great joy was to make rapid progress. And although the only English words in his initial conversations with his uncle were hello and goodbye, they soon managed to shift more and more of the conversation into English, which led to their broaching topics of a more intimate nature. Such was his uncle’s satisfaction over the first American poem that Karl was able to recite one evening—a description of a great fire—that he be came deadly serious. At that moment both stood by a window in Karl’s room; his uncle was looking out at the sky, from which all trace of daylight had disappeared, clapping his hands slowly and regularly in accord with the verses while Karl stood erect and glassy-eyed beside him, wrestling with the words of the difficult poem."
"Alles war klar und wurde ja auch von Schubal wider Willen so dargeboten, aber den Herren mußte man es anders, noch handgreiflicher sagen. Sie brauchten Auf- rüttelung. Also Karl, rasch, nütze jetzt wenigstens die Zeit aus, ehe die Zeugen aufreten und alles über- schwemmen.","Everything was clear and was presented in this way by Schubal against his will, but the gentlemen had to be told differently, even more tangibly. They needed a shake up. So Karl, quickly, at least make use of the time before the witnesses appear and flood everything.","It was all so clear, and in spite of himself Schubal only confirmed it, but the gentlemen still needed to have it put to them even more unambiguously. They needed shaking up. So, Karl, hurry up and use the time before the witnesses appear and muddy everything.","All this was very clear and indeed that is how Schubal had presented it, quite against his will, but one had to tell the story to the gentlemen in a different way, even more explicitly. They had to be given a jolt. So get moving, Karl, and at least take advantage of the time before the witnesses enter and inundate everything."
"„Sofort sind sie draußen, zieh Dich nur schon aus"", saete Delamarche, gieng zu Robinson hin und schüttelte ihn mit dem Fuß, den er ihm auf die Brust setzte. Gleichzeitig rief er Karl zu: „Roßmann, aufstehn! Ihr müßt beide auf den Balkon! Und wehe Euch wenn Ihr früher hereinkommt, ehe man Euch ruf! Und jetzt flink, Robinson"" – dabei schüttelte er Robinson stärker „und Du Roßmann, gib Acht, daß ich nicht auch über Dich komme"" – dabei klatschte er laut zweimal in die Hände. „Wie lang das dauert!"" rief Brunelda auf dem Kanapee, sie hatte beim Sitzen die Beine weit auseinan- dergestellt, um ihrem übermäßig dicken Körper mehr Raum zu verschaffen, nur mit größter Anstrengung, un- ter vielem Schnaufen und häufigem Ausruhn, konnte sie sich soweit bücken um ihre Strümpfe am obersten Ende zu fassen und ein wenig herunterzuziehn, gänzlich aus- ziehn konnte sie sie nicht, das mußte Delamarche besor- gen auf den sie nun ungeduldig wartete.","""They'll be outside in a minute, just get undressed,"" said Delamarche, went over to Robinson and shook him with the foot he put on his chest. At the same time he called to Karl: ""Roßmann, get up! You both have to get up the balcony! And woe to you if you come in earlier before you are called! And now be quick, Robinson"" - he shook Robinson harder ""and you Roßmann, be careful that I don't come over you too"" - and he clapped loudly twice in your hands. ""How long this is going to take!"" cried Brunelda on the sofa, she had put her legs wide apart while sitting to give her excessively fat body more space, only with great effort, with a lot of panting and frequent resting, was she able to bend down to get her stockings on grab the top end and pull it down a little, she couldn't take it off completely, Delamarche, for whom she was now impatiently waiting, had to do that.","‘I’ll have them out right away, you go ahead and undress,’ said Delamarche, and went over to Robinson, set his foot on his chest and shook it. At the same time he called over to Karl: ‘Rossmann, get up! You’re both to go out on the balcony! And woe betide either one of you that tries to come back in before you’re sent for! Get a move on, Robinson’ – and he shook him a bit harder – ‘and you too, Rossmann, unless you want me to pay you a call as well’ – and he clapped his hands loudly twice. ‘It’s taking so long!’ cried Brunelda from the sofa, as she sat, she had her legs wide apart to give her excessive bulk a little more room, only with the utmost effort, with much panting and frequent rests could she bend down to reach the top of her stockings and roll them down a little , she was incapable of taking them off herself, that had to be done by Delamarche, for whom she was impatiently waiting.","“They’ll be gone in a second, so you can start getting undressed,” said Delamarche, and he went over to Robinson and shook him with his foot, which he had placed on his chest. At the same time he shouted to Karl: “Rossmann, get up! Both of you have to go out on the balcony! And woe betide you if you come back before you’re called! And be quick about it, Robinson.” He shook Robinson more vigorously—“And you, Rossmann, watch out, or I’ll have a go at you too”—and he made two loud clapping sounds with his hands. “It’s taking so long!” cried Brunelda from the settee; while seating herself, she had spread her legs far apart to create more room for her immoderately fat body, and only with the greatest effort, amid a great deal of panting and frequent pauses for rest, did she manage to bend down far enough to grab the tops of her stockings and pull them down a little, for she could not remove them entirely— that was a job for Delamarche, whom she awaited impatiently."
„Nun weil Du doch meine Arbeit hier übernehmen,"""Well, because you're taking over my work here","‘Well, because you’re due to take over from me here,’ replied Robinson.","“Well, since you’re meant to take over my work,” answered Robinson."
"Als er in Clayton ausstieg, hörte er gleich den Lärm vieler Trompeten. Es war ein wirrer Lärm, die Trompe- ten waren nicht gegeneinander abgestimmt, es wurde rücksichtslos geblasen. Aber das störte Karl nicht, es bestätigte ihm vielmehr daß das Teater von Oklahama ein großes Unternehmen war. Aber als er aus dem Sta- tionsgebäude trat und die ganze Anlage vor sich über- blickte, sah er, daß alles noch größer war, als er nur irgendwie hatte denken können, und er begriff nicht wie ein Unternehmen nur zu dem Zweck um Personal zu erhalten derartige Aufwendungen machen konnte. Vor dem Eingang zum Rennplatz war ein langes niedriges Podium aufgebaut, auf dem hunderte Frauen als Engel gekleidet in weißen Tüchern mit großen Flügeln am Rücken auf langen goldglänzenden Trompeten bliesen. Sie waren aber nicht unmittelbar auf dem Podium, son- dern jede stand auf einem Postament, das aber nicht zu sehen war, denn die langen wehenden Tücher der Engel- kleidung hüllten es vollständig ein. Da nun die Posta- mente sehr hoch, wohl bis zwei Meter hoch waren, sa- hen die Gestalten der Frauen riesenhaf aus, nur ihre kleinen Köpfe störten ein wenig den Eindruck der Grö- ße, auch ihr gelöstes Haar hieng zu kurz und fast lächer- lich zwischen den großen Flügeln und an den Seiten hinab. Damit keine Einförmigkeit entstehe, hatte man Postamente in der verschiedensten Größe verwendet, es gab ganz niedrige Frauen, nicht weit über Lebensgröße, aber neben ihnen schwangen sich andere Frauen in sol- che Höhe hinauf, daß man sie beim leichtesten Windstoß in Gefahr glaubte. Und nun bliesen alle diese Frauen. Es gab nicht viele Zuhörer. Klein im Vergleich zu den großen Gestalten giengen etwa zehn Burschen vor dem Podium hin und her und blickten zu den Frauen hinauf. Sie zeigten einander diese oder jene, sie schienen aber nicht die Absicht zu haben einzutreten und sich aufneh- men zu lassen. Nur ein einziger älterer Mann war zu sehn, er stand ein wenig abseits. Er hatte gleich auch seine Frau und ein Kind im Kinderwagen mitgebracht. Die Frau hielt mit der einen Hand den Wagen, mit der andern stützte sie sich auf die Schulter des Mannes. Sie bewunderten zwar das Schauspiel, aber man erkannte doch, daß sie enttäuscht waren. Sie hatten wohl auch erwartet eine Arbeitsgelegenheit zu finden, dieses Trom- petenblasen aber beirrte sie.","As he got out at Clayton, he immediately heard the sound of many trumpets. It was a confused noise, the trumpets were not tuned to each other, they blew ruthlessly. But that didn't bother Karl, rather it reassured him that the Oklahama Theater was a big business. But as he stepped out of the station building and surveyed the whole facility in front of him, he saw that everything was even bigger than he could have possibly imagined, and he didn't grasp human resources like a company for the sole purpose of hiring get such expenses could make. In front of the entrance to the racecourse there was a long, low podium on which hundreds of women dressed as angels in white shawls with large wings on their backs blew long golden trumpets. However, they were not directly on the podium, but each stood on a pedestal, which, however, could not be seen, for the long flowing cloths of the angelic clothing completely covered it. Since the pedestals were very high, probably up to two meters high, the figures of the women looked gigantic, only their small heads disturbed the impression of size a little, their loose hair was too short and almost laughable - lich between the large wings and down the sides. So that there was no uniformity, pedestals of various sizes had been used. There were very low women, not much larger than life, but next to them other women swung themselves so high that one thought they would be in danger at the slightest gust of wind. And now all these women blew. There weren't many listeners. Small in comparison to the tall figures, about ten boys paced in front of the dais and looked up at the women. They showed each other this or that, but they didn't seem to have any intention of going in and being photographed. There was only one older man to be seen, standing a little to one side. He had brought his wife and a child in a stroller with him. The woman held the wagon with one hand and leaned on the man's shoulder with the other. Although they admired the spectacle, it was obvious that they were disappointed. They had probably also expected to find a job opportunity, but this trumpet-blowing threw them off.","When he got out in Clayton, the sound of many trumpets greeted his ears. It was a confused noise, the trumpets weren’t playing in tune, there was just wild playing. But that didn’t bother Karl, rather it confirmed to him what a great enterprise the Theatre of Oklahoma was. But when he left the station and saw the whole racecourse ahead of him, he saw that everything was much bigger than he could possibly have imagined, and he couldn’t understand how an organization could go to such lengths merely for the recruitment of personnel. Outside the entrance to the racecourse was a long low stage, on which a hundred women dressed as angels in white cloths, with great wings on their backs were blowing into golden trumpets. They weren’t standing directly on the stage though, each of them stood on an individual pedestal that couldn’t be seen, because the long billowing robes of the angel costumes completely covered them. As the pedestals were very high, as much as six feet, the figures of the women looked gigantic, only their little heads looked somewhat out of scale, and their hair, which they wore loose, looked too short and almost laughable, hanging between the big wings and down the side of them. To avoid uniformity, pedestals of all different sizes had been used, there were some quite low women, not much above life size, but others next to them seemed to scale such heights that they were surely in danger from every breath of wind. And now all these women were blowing trumpets. There weren’t many listeners. Small by comparison to their great forms, about a dozen or so youths walked up and down in front of the stage, looking up at the women. They pointed at this one or that one, but didn’t seem to have any intention of joining up or going inside. Only one slightly older man was to be seen, he stood a little to one side. He had brought along his wife and a baby in a pram. The woman held the pram with one hand, with the other she supported herself on the man’s shoulder. They admired the performance, but you could see they were disappointed too. They were probably expecting to find a work opportunity, and were confused by the trumpeting.","After getting out in Clayton, he heard the clamor of a great many trumpets. It was a confused clamor, the trumpets were not in tune; they were being played quite heedlessly. Still, this did not bother Karl since it merely confirmed in his mind that the Theater of Oklahama was a large enterprise. But on stepping out of the station, where he could survey the entire complex spread out before him, he saw that it was far bigger than he could possibly have imagined, and he could not understand how an enterprise of this kind was able to go to such expense merely for the purpose of adding staff. In front of the entrance to the racetrack was a long, low platform on which hundreds of women, dressed as angels in white robes with large wings on their backs, blew long trumpets that shone like gold. But they were not directly on the platform; each stood on her own pedestal, which however was not visible, for it was completely covered by the angels’ long billowing robes. Since the pedestals were very high, a good two meters tall, the figures of these women looked gigantic, though this impression of great size was somewhat marred by their small heads; even their loose hair was too short and looked almost ridiculous, as it hung down between their large wings and down along their sides. To avoid seeming monotonous, pedestals of greatly differing sizes had been used; some women were not much larger than life size, while others alongside them soared so high that one imagined that the lightest gust of wind could imperil them. And now all of these women blew their trumpets. There wasn’t much of an audience. Looking quite small compared to these large figures, some ten youths walked back and forth in front of the platform, gazing up at the women. They pointed at one or the other; however, they seemed to have no intention of walking in and seeking admission. One could see only one older man, who stood somewhat aside from the others. He had already brought along his wife and a child in a baby carriage. With one hand his wife held on to the carriage and with the other leaned on her husband’s shoulder. Though they marveled at the spectacle, one could see that they were disappointed. They too must have expected that there would be an opportunity for them to find employment, but this trumpet-blowing merely left them confused."
"„Du bist eben noch ein Kind, Roßmann"", sagte Ro- binson, zog einen Dolch, den er an einer Halsschnur trug, unter dem Hemd hervor, nahm die Dolchkappe ab und zerschnitt die harte Wurst. „Du mußt noch viel zulernen. Bist aber bei uns an der richtigen Quelle. Setz Dich doch. Willst Du nicht auch etwas essen. Nun viel- leicht bekommst Du Appetit, wenn Du mir zuschaust. Trinken willst Du auch nicht? Du willst aber rein gar nichts. Und gesprächig bist Du gerade auch nicht beson- ders. Aber es ist ganz gleichgültig, mit wem man auf dem Balkon ist, wenn nur überhaupt jemand da ist. Ich bin nämlich sehr of auf dem Balkon. Das macht der Brunelda solchen Spaß. Es muß ihr nur etwas einfallen, einmal ist ihr kalt, einmal heiß, einmal will sie schlafen, einmal will sie sich kämmen, einmal will sie das Mieder öffnen, einmal will sie es anziehn und da werde ich im- mer auf den Balkon geschickt. Manchmal tut sie wirk- lich das was sie sagt, aber meistens liegt sie nur so wie früher auf dem Kanapee und rührt sich nicht. Früher habe ich öfers den Vorhang so ein wenig weggezogen und durchgeschaut, aber seitdem einmal Delamarche bei einer solchen Gelegenheit – ich weiß genau daß er es nicht wollte, sondern es nur auf Bruneldas Bitte tat – mir mit der Peitsche einige Male ins Gesicht geschlagen hat – siehst Du den Striemen? – wage ich nicht mehr durchzu- schauen. Und so liege ich dann hier auf dem Balkon und habe kein Vergnügen außer dem Essen. Vorgestern als ich da abend so allein gelegen bin, damals war ich noch in meinen eleganten Kleidern die ich leider in Deinem Hotel verloren habe – diese Hunde! reißen einem die teuern Kleider vom Leib! – als ich also da so allein gele- gen bin und durch das Geländer heruntergeschaut habe, war mir alles so traurig und ich habe zu heulen angefan- gen. Da ist zufällig ohne daß ich es gleich bemerkt habe, die Brunelda zu mir herausgekommen in dem roten Kleid – das paßt ihr doch von allen am besten –, hat mir ein wenig zugeschaut und hat endlich gesagt: ‚Robinso- nerl, warum weinst Du?' Dann hat sie ihr Kleid gehoben und mir mit dem Saum die Augen abgewischt. Wer weiß, was sie noch getan hätte, wenn da nicht Delamarche nach ihr gerufen hätte und sie nicht sofort wieder ins Zimmer hätte hineingehn müssen. Natürlich habe ich gedacht, jetzt sei die Reihe an mir und habe durch den Vorhang gefragt ob ich schon ins Zimmer darf. Und was meinst Du, hat die Brunelda gesagt? ‚Nein!' hat sie ge- sagt und ‚was fällt Dir ein?' hat sie gesagt.""","""You're just a child, Rossmann,"" said Robinson, pulled a dagger that he wore on a neck cord from under his shirt, took off the dagger cap and cut through the hard sausage. ""You still have a lot to learn. You are But with us you have come to the right source. Sit down. Don't you want to eat something too. Well, maybe you'll get an appetite if you watch me. You don't want to drink either? But you don't want anything at all. And you're talkative right now not particularly either. But it doesn't matter who you're on the balcony with, as long as there's someone there. I'm on the balcony very often. Brunelda enjoys it so much. She just has to think of something sometimes she's cold, sometimes hot, sometimes she wants to sleep, sometimes she wants to comb her hair, sometimes she wants to open her bodice, sometimes she wants to put it on and I'm always sent out onto the balcony. Sometimes she really does that what she says, but mostly she just lies on the sofa like she used to and doesn't move. I used to pull back the curtain a little and look through it, but ever since Delamarche on one such occasion - I know perfectly well that he didn't mean to do it, only did it at Brunelda's request - hit me in the face a few times with his whip - do you see the welt? – I dare not look through it any longer. And so I lie here on the balcony and have no pleasure other than eating. The day before yesterday when I was lying there alone in the evening, I was still in my elegant clothes, which I unfortunately lost in your hotel – those dogs! rip your expensive clothes off! – so when I lay there alone and looked down through the banister, everything made me so sad and I started to cry. Then, without me noticing it right away, Brunelda happened to come out to me in the red dress – that fits her best of all –, watched me a little and finally said: 'Robinsonerl, why are you crying?' Then she lifted her dress and wiped my eyes with the hem. Who knows what else she would have done if Delamarche hadn't called for her and she hadn't had to go straight back into the room. Of course I thought it was my turn and asked through the curtain if I could go into the room. And what do you mean, did Brunelda say? ,No!' she said and 'what do you think of?' she said.""","‘You’re still just a baby, Rossmann,’ said Robinson, pulled out a dagger he wore on a string round his neck, uncapped it and cut up the hard sausage. ‘You’ve got a lot to learn still. You’ve come to the right place for that, though. Sit down. Don’t you want anything to eat? Well, maybe watching me will give you an appetite. Or to drink either? Well, what do you want? You’re not exactly chatty either. But I don’t mind who’s out on the balcony with me, so long as I’ve got someone. I spend a lot of time out here. Brunelda gets a kick out of that. Any excuse is good enough, either she’s cold or she’s hot or she wants to sleep or comb her hair, or she wants to take off her corset or put it on, and each time I get put out on the balcony. Sometimes she does what she says, but usually she just stays lying on the sofa just as before, and doesn’t move a muscle. I used to pull the curtain open a crack and take a peep inside, but ever since Delamarche caught me like that once – I know for a fact he didn’t want to do it, he just did it because Brunelda asked him – and hit me in the face a few times with his whip – do you see the welt? – I haven’t dared do it any more. And so I lie out here on the balcony, and my only pleasure is eating. The day before yesterday as I was lying out here alone of an evening – then I still had my elegant clothes, which I unfortunately lost in your hotel – those bastards! ripping the expensive gear off your back! – so, as I was lying there alone, looking down through the railing, I felt so sad I started to cry. Then, without my noticing it at first, Brunelda came out in her red dress – that’s the one that suits her best if you ask me – watched me a while, and finally said: “Little Robinson, why are you crying?” Then she picked up her skirts and dried my eyes on the hem. Who knows what more she might have done if Delamarche hadn’t shouted for her, and she didn’t have to go back inside at once. Of course I thought it’s my turn now, and I called through the curtain to ask if I could go back in the room. And what do you suppose she said? She said “No!”","“You’re really still only a child, Rossmann,” said Robinson, then drew from his shirt a dagger that hung from a piece of string tied around his neck, took it from its scabbard, and cut the hard sausage into little pieces. “You still have a lot to learn. But you’ve come to the right place for that. Do sit down. You don’t want to eat? Well, you can develop an appetite as you watch me eat. You don’t want to drink either? You don’t want anything? And you’re not especially talkative either. But it really doesn’t matter who’s out here on the balcony, so long as there’s somebody else here. You see, I’m often out on the balcony. It’s a great sport for Brunelda. She’s always thinking of something new, first she’s cold , then she’s hot , then she wants to sleep, then she wants to comb her hair, then she’d like to open her corset, then she wants to put it on, so I’m always being sent out on the balcony. At times she actually does what she says, but for the most part she stays on the settee and doesn’t stir. Often I would part the curtains a little and look in, but ever since one such occasion when Delamarche—I know for certain that it wasn’t his idea and that he did so only at Brunelda’s request—hit me on the face with a whip—can you see the weals it left?—I don’t dare look anymore. So I lie out here on the balcony, and the only pleasure left is eating. The day before yesterday, as I lay here all alone in the evening, still wearing my elegant clothes, which, alas, I then lost at your hotel—those dogs! the way they tore those expensive clothes from my body—as I lay here all alone, gazing down between the columns of the balustrade, everything somehow seemed so sad that I started to bawl. Though I didn’t notice right away, at that moment Brunelda came out wearing her red dress —it’s the one that suits her best—and , after watching me for a while, she finally said: ‘Dear little Robinson, why are you crying?’ Then she lifted her dress and wiped my eyes with the hem. Who knows what else she might have done if Delamarche hadn’t called for her just then and she hadn’t had to go back into the room right away. Of course, I thought it was going to be my turn, so I asked through the curtain whether I could go back into the room. And what do you think Brunelda said? ‘No,’ she said, and then she said, ‘How dare you?’ ”"

"Aber alles mahnte zur Eile, zur Deutlichkeit, zu ganz genauer Darstellung, aber was tat der Heizer? Er redete sich allerdings in Schweiß, die Papiere auf dem Fenster konnte er längst mit seinen zitternden Händen nicht mehr halten, aus allen Himmelsrichtungen strömten ihm Klagen über Schubal zu, von denen seiner Meinung nach jede einzelne genügt hätte diesen Schubal vollständig zu begraben, aber was er dem Kapitän vorzeigen konnte, war nur ein trauriges Durcheinanderstrudeln aller insge- samt. Längst schon pfiff der Herr mit dem Bambus- stöckchen schwach zur Decke hinauf, die Herren von der Hafenbehörde hielten schon den Officier an ihrem Tisch und machten keine Miene ihn je wieder loszulas- sen, der Oberkassier wurde sichtlich nur durch die Ruhe des Kapitäns vor dem Dreinfahren zurückgehalten, wo- nach es ihn juckte. Der Diener erwartete in Habtacht- Stellung jeden Augenblick einen auf den Heizer bezüg- lichen Befehl seines Kapitäns.","But everything called for haste, for clarity, for a very precise description, but what did the stoker do? He was talking himself into a sweat, of course, he couldn't hold the papers on the window with his trembling hands for a long time, complaints about Schubal streamed in from all directions, each of which in his opinion would have been enough to bury this Schubal completely, but what he could show the captain was just a sad jumble of all together. The gentleman was already whistling softly up to the ceiling with the bamboo stick, the gentlemen from the port authorities were already holding the officer at their table and didn't show any sign of ever letting go of him again, the chief cashier was only visible because of the captain's calmness in front of him Dreinfahr held back, after which he itched. The servant stood at attention at any moment awaiting an order from his captain regarding the stoker.","Everything enjoined haste, precision, clarity of representation – and what was the stoker doing? He was talking himself into a lather, his trembling hands could no longer hold the papers by the window-sill. He was deluged with complaints about Schubal that came to him from every direction, any one of which in his opinion would have sufficed to completely bury Schubal, but all he could put across to the captain was just a mishmash of all of them. The man with the bamboo cane had begun whistling quietly up at the ceiling, the men from the port authority had the officer at their table again, and showed no sign of relinquishing him, the chief cashier was obviously only constrained by the calm of the captain from the intervention he was all too eager to make. The sergeant was waiting at attention for an imminent order from the captain regarding the stoker.","But although everything cried out for haste, clarity, and the most precise description, what did the stoker do? He had certainly talked himself into a sweat and was no longer able to hold the papers on the windowsill in his trembling hands; he kept thinking of new complaints about Schubal from every conceivable angle, each of which would, he believed, have sufficed to demolish Schubal, although he had managed to give the captain only a pathetic mishmash of all that. For some time now the gentleman with the little bamboo stick had been whistling softly at the ceiling; the gentlemen from the harbor authority had detained the officer at their table and gave no sign that they were about to release him; only the composure shown by the captain made the chief bursar refrain from bursting in, as he longed to do. The attendant, who stood at attention, awaited an imminent order from his captain with regard to the stoker."
"„Dir ist ja Unrecht geschehn wie keinem auf dem Schiff, das weiß ich ganz genau."" Und Karl zog seine Finger hin und her zwischen den Fingern des Heizers, der mit glänzenden Augen ringsumher schaute, als wi- derfahre ihm eine Wonne, die ihm aber niemand ver- übeln möge.","""You've been wronged like nobody else on the ship, I know that very well."" And Karl drew his fingers back and forth between the fingers of the stoker, who looked around with shining eyes, as if he were experiencing a bliss that he had but don't blame anyone.","‘You’ve suffered an injustice, more than anyone else on the ship, I’m convinced of that.’ And Karl slipped his fingers back and forth between those of the stoker, whose eyes were shining and looking around as though feeling inexpressible bliss and at the same time daring anyone to take it away from him.","“You’ve suffered greater injustice than anybody else on this ship, I’m quite sure of that.” And Karl drew his fingers back and forth between the stoker’s fingers; with a sparkle in his eyes, the latter looked around on every side, as though overcome by a great joy, but one that nobody ought to hold against him."
"Dann aber sagte Karl, jetzt dürfen sie sich keinen Aufenthalt mehr gönnen, der Weg sei lang und sie seien viel später ausgefahren, als es beabsichtigt war. Tatsäch- lich sah man schon hie und da Fuhrwerke und, wenn auch sehr vereinzelt Leute, die zur Arbeit giengen. Karl hatte mit seiner Bemerkung nichts weiter sagen wollen, als was er wirklich gesagt hatte, Brunelda aber faßte es in ihrem Zartgefühl anders auf und bedeckte sich ganz und gar mit ihrem grauen Tuch. Karl wendete nichts dagegen ein; der mit einem grauen Tuch bedeckte Handwagen war zwar sehr auffällig, aber unvergleichlich weniger auffällig als die unbedeckte Brunelda gewesen wäre. Er fuhr sehr vorsichtig; ehe er um eine Ecke bog, beobach- tete er die nächste Straße, ließ sogar wenn es nötig schien, den Wagen stehn und gieng allein paar Schritte voraus, sah er irgend eine vielleicht unangenehme Begeg- nung voraus, so wartete er, bis sie sich vermeiden ließ oder wählte sogar den Weg durch eine ganz andere Stra- ße. Selbst dann kam er, da er alle möglichen Wege vorher genau studiert hatte, niemals in die Gefahr einen bedeu- tenden Umweg zu machen. Allerdings erschienen Hin- dernisse, die zwar zu befürchten gewesen waren, sich aber im einzelnen nicht hatten vorhersehn lassen. So trat plötzlich in einer Straße, die leicht ansteigend, weit zu überblicken und erfreulicherweise vollständig leer war, ein Vorteil, den Karl durch besondere Eile auszunützen suchte, aus dem dunklen Winkel eines Haustors ein Po- lizeimann und fragte Karl, was er denn in dem so sorg- fältig verdeckten Wagen führe. So streng er aber Karl angesehen hatte, so mußte er doch lächeln, als er die Decke lüfete und das erhitzte ängstliche Gesicht Bru- neldas erblickte. „Wie?"" sagte er. „Ich dachte Du hättest hier zehn Kartoffelsäcke und jetzt ist es ein einziges Frauenzimmer? Wohin fahrt Ihr denn? Wer seid Ihr?"" Brunelda wagte gar nicht den Polizeimann anzusehn, sondern blickte nur immer auf Karl mit dem deutlichen Zweifel, daß selbst er sie nicht werde erretten können. Karl hatte aber schon genug Erfahrungen mit Policisten, ihm schien das ganze nicht sehr gefährlich. „Zeigen Sie doch Fräulein"", sagte er, „das Schrifstück, das Sie be- kommen haben."" „Ach ja"", sagte Brunelda und begann in einer so hoffnungslosen Weise zu suchen, daß sie wirklich verdächtig erscheinen mußte. „Das Fräulein"", sagte der Polizeimann mit zweifelloser Ironie, „wird das Schrifstück nicht finden."" „Oja"", sagte Karl ruhig, „sie hat es bestimmt, sie hat es nur verlegt."" Er begann nun selbst zu suchen und zog es tatsächlich hinter Bruneldas Rücken hervor. Der Polizeimann sah es nur flüchtig an. „Das ist es also"", sagte der Polizeimann lächelnd, „so ein Fräulein ist das Fräulein? Und Sie, Kleiner, besorgen die Vermittlung und den Transport? Wissen Sie wirklich keine bessere Beschäfigung zu finden?"" Karl zuckte bloß die Achseln, das waren wieder die bekannten Ein- mischungen der Polizei. „Na, glückliche Reise"", sagte der Polizeimann, als er keine Antwort bekam. In den Worten des Polizeimanns lag wahrscheinlich Verach- tung, dafür fuhr auch Karl ohne Gruß weiter, Verach- tung der Polizei war besser als ihre Aufmerksamkeit.","But then Karl said, now they can't allow themselves any more stays, the way is long and they left much later than intended. In fact, here and there you could see carts and, albeit very sporadically, people going to work. With his remark Karl had meant nothing more than what he had really said, but Brunelda, in her delicacy, took it differently and covered herself completely with her gray cloth. Karl didn't object; the handcart, covered with a gray cloth, was very conspicuous, but incomparably less conspicuous than the uncovered Brunelda would have been. He drove very carefully; Before he turned a corner, he watched the next street, even if it seemed necessary, left the car where it was and walked a few steps ahead alone, if he foresaw any perhaps unpleasant encounter, he waited until it happened avoided or even chose the path through a completely different street. Even then, since he had carefully studied all possible routes beforehand, he never ran into the danger of making a significant detour. Admittedly, obstacles appeared which had been feared but which could not have been foreseen in detail. Suddenly in a street that climbed slightly, had a wide view and was fortunately completely empty, an advantage that Karl tried to take advantage of by being particularly hasty, a policeman stepped out of the dark corner of a house gate and asked Karl what he was doing there so carefully concealed chariot. However sternly he had looked at Karl, he still had to smile when he lifted the covers and saw Brunelda's flushed, anxious face. ""How?"" he said. ""I thought you had ten sacks of potatoes here and now it's just one woman? Where are you going? Who are you?"" Brunelda didn't dare look at the policeman, but only kept looking at Karl with the clear doubt that even he wouldn't be able to save her. But Karl already had enough experience with police officers, it didn't seem very dangerous to him. ""Show Fraulein,"" he said, ""the document you received."" ""Oh yes,"" said Brunelda and began to search in such a hopeless manner that she really had to appear suspicious. ""The young lady,"" said the policeman with undoubted irony, ""won't find the document."" ""Oh yes,"" said Karl quietly, ""She determined it, she just misplaced it."" He now began to look for it himself and actually pulled it out from behind Brunelda's back. The policeman only glanced at it briefly. ""So that's it,"" said the policeman, smiling. ""That lady is that kind of lady? And you, kid, arrange the placement and the transport? Don't you really think you can't find a better job?"" Karl just shrugged his shoulders, that was the usual interference from the police. ""Well, happy travels,"" said the policeman when he got no answer. There was probably contempt in the words of the policeman, so Karl drove on without saying hello, contempt for the police was better than their attention.","But then Karl said they mustn’t have any more stops, they had a long way ahead of them, and had set out much later than they’d meant to. And indeed, one could already see the occasional vehicle, and even the odd pedestrian too, on his way to work. Karl had meant nothing more by his remark than what he had said, but Brunelda with her sensitivity had a different interpretation and completely covered herself with her grey cloth. Karl made no objection; a handcart with a grey cloth draped over it was still a very arresting sight but incomparably less than a clearly visible Brunelda would have been. He navigated very carefully; before turning a corner, he would look down the street; if it seemed necessary, he even left the wagon and went on alone a few paces, if he could see some potentially disagreeable encounter looming, then he waited until it might be avoided, or even followed a different route down a new street. But even then, as he’d previously studied all possible routes in detail, he never risked making a long detour. Even so, there were obstacles that might have been anticipated, but couldn’t be foreseen individually. Suddenly, for instance, in a street that climbed gently, enjoyed good visibility, and was happily completely deserted, something that Karl sought to make the most of by especial haste, a policeman emerged from the dark corner of an entry way, and asked Karl what he was pushing in his carefully covered cart. Though he had looked quite stern to begin with, he had to smile when he lifted the cloth and saw the hot and apprehensive form of Brunelda. ‘Hello!’ he said. ‘There I was thinking you had about ten sacks of potatoes, and it’s just one female? Where are you headed for? Who are you?’ Brunelda didn’t even dare look at the policeman, but kept her eyes on Karl, evidently doubting that even he would be able to save her. But Karl had had enough dealings with policemen, the whole affair didn’t seem so terribly threatening to him. ‘Miss, why don’t you show him’, he said, ‘the piece of paper you were given?’ ‘Oh yes,’ said Brunelda, and started looking, but in such a hopeless fashion that she really would arouse suspicion. ‘Miss’, said the policeman with manifest irony, ‘seems unable to find her paper.’ ‘Not at all,’ said Karl calmly, ‘she’s got it all right, she’s just mislaid it.’ He began looking for it himself, and soon pulled it out from behind Brunelda’s back. The policeman gave it a perfunctory glance. ‘So that’s you, is it,’ said the policeman with a smile, ‘Miss? And what about you, little fellow, in charge of transport and arrangements? Can’t you find any better occupation?’ Karl merely shrugged his shoulders, that was just typical police nosiness. ‘Well, have a good trip then,’ said the policeman, when he didn’t get an answer. There was probably contempt in the policeman’s tone, and so Karl went away without saying goodbye, the contempt of the police was still preferable to their interest.","Karl, however, then said that they should not make any further stops since they had a long journey ahead and had left much later than anticipated. And indeed one could already see carriages here and there, and even a few isolated figures heading to work. By that remark Karl had meant only what he had in fact said, but in her tactful way Brunelda had understood it differently and now covered herself entirely in her gray shawl. Karl did not object to this; true, having the handcart covered with a gray shawl was quite conspicuous, but incomparably less so than if one were to carry Brunelda in there without any covering. He pushed the cart very carefully; before turning a corner, he always looked into the next street first and only then left the cart, if necessary, and went forward alone; whenever he anticipated a possibly unpleasant encounter, he waited until it could be avoided or even decided to go down an entirely different street. And since he had studied every possible route, there was never any danger of having to make a big detour. Of course, there were still some obstacles to be feared, yet one couldn’t really have foreseen the particulars. For instance, all of a sudden, in a street that sloped gently uphill, could be easily surveyed, and, pleasantly enough, was quite empty—Karl turned this to his advantage by hurrying up—a policeman stepped from a dark corner at one of the front gates and asked Karl what he was carrying in his carefully covered cart. Yet despite the severe looks he directed at Karl, the policeman had to laugh when he lifted the cover and saw Brunelda ’s overheated and frightened face. “What?” he said. “I thought you had ten bags of potatoes and now it’s only one woman? Where are you going? Who are you?” Brunelda did not dare to look at the policeman and simply gazed at Karl, clearly doubting that even he could save her anymore. Karl had enough experience with policemen, though; none of this seemed dangerous. “But Miss,” he said, “show the officer the document you’ve got.” “Oh yes,” said Brunelda, and she searched for it in such a hopeless manner that she now began to seem truly suspect. “The young miss,” said the policeman with obvious irony, “won’t be able to find the document.” “Oh, but she will,” said Karl calmly. “She certainly has it and has simply misplaced it.” He now searched for it himself and soon pulled it out from behind Brunelda’s back. The policeman merely gave it a cursory glance. “So that’s it,” the policeman said, laughing. “She’s that sort of young miss. And your job, little fellow, is to make arrangements and transport her? Is that really the best job you can find?” Karl simply shrugged his shoulders; once again the police were meddling. “Well, pleasant trip,” said the policeman when he did not receive an answer. There was probably a certain contempt in the policeman’s tone, which caused Karl to leave without saying goodbye; after all, it was better to arouse the contempt of the police than to attract their attention."
"„Du mußt Dich aber zur Wehr setzen, ja und nein sagen, sonst haben ja die Leute keine Ahnung von der Wahrheit. Du mußt mir versprechen, daß Du mir folgen wirst, denn ich selbst, das fürchte ich mit vielem Grund, werde Dir gar nicht mehr helfen können."" Und nun weinte Karl, während er die Hand des Heizers küßte und nahm die rissige, fast leblose Hand und drückte sie an seine Wangen, wie einen Schatz, auf den man verzich- ten muß. – Da war aber auch schon der Onkel Senator an seiner Seite und zog ihn, wenn auch nur mit dem leichtesten Zwange, fort. „Der Heizer scheint Dich be- zaubert zu haben"", sagte er und sah verständnisinnig über Karls Kopf zum Kapitän hin. „Du hast Dich verlas- sen gefühlt, da hast Du den Heizer gefunden und bist ihm jetzt dankbar, das ist ja ganz löblich. Treibe das aber, schon mir zuliebe, nicht zu weit und lerne Deine Stellung begreifen.""","""But you have to put up a fight, say yes and no, otherwise people wouldn't have any idea of the truth. You have to promise me that you will follow me, because I myself, I fear with good reason, won't be able to help you anymore."" And now Karl wept while he kissed the stoker's hand and took the cracked, almost lifeless hand hand and pressed it to his cheeks, like a treasure that one has to do without. - But then the uncle Senator was already at his side and pulled him away, even if only with the slightest compulsion. ""The stoker shines To have charmed you,"" he said and looked over Karl's head at the captain with understanding. ""You felt abandoned, that's when you found the stoker and you're grateful to him now, that's really commendable. But don't take that too far, if only for my sake, and learn to understand your position.""","‘You must stand up for yourself, say yes and no, otherwise people will never learn the truth. I want you to promise me to do that, because I’m very much afraid that soon I won’t be able to help you any more.’ Karl was crying as he kissed the stoker’s cracked and almost lifeless hand, holding it and pressing it to his cheek, like some dear thing from which he had to be parted. His uncle the Senator appeared at his side, and, ever so gently, pulled him away. ‘The stoker seems to have put you under his spell,’ he said, and looked knowingly across to the captain over Karl’s head. ‘You felt abandoned, then you found the stoker, and you’re showing your gratitude to him, it’s all very laudable. But please for my sake don’t overdo it, and learn to come to terms with your position.’","“But you must defend yourself, say yes and no, otherwise people won’t have any idea about the truth. You must promise me you’ll do as I say, for I fear that for various reasons I’ll no longer be able to help you.” And Karl wept as he kissed the stoker’s hand and took that chapped, almost lifeless hand and pressed it to his cheeks, like a treasure one must relinquish. However, his uncle, the senator, was already by his side and pulled him away, if only with the slightest pressure. “The stoker seems to have bewitched you,” he said, casting a knowing look at the captain over Karl’s head. “You felt abandoned, then found the stoker and now you’re grateful to him, which certainly speaks in your favor. But don’t carry this too far, if only for my sake, and do try to understand your position.”"
"„Ich störe Sie?"" fragte Karl.","""Am I disturbing you?"" Karl asked.",‘Am I disturbing you?’ asked Karl.,“I’m disturbing you?” asked Karl.
"„Du bist mein Onkel"", sagte Karl und küßte ihm die Hand und wurde dafür auf die Stirn geküßt. „Ich bin sehr froh daß ich Dich getroffen habe, aber Du irrst, wenn Du glaubst, daß meine Eltern nur Schlechtes von Dir reden. Aber auch abgesehen davon sind in Deiner Rede einige Fehler enthalten gewesen, d. h. ich meine, es hat sich in Wirklichkeit nicht alles so zugetragen. Du kannst aber auch wirklich von hier aus die Dinge nicht so gut beurteilen und ich glaube außerdem, daß es kei- nen besondern Schaden bringen wird, wenn die Herren in Einzelheiten einer Sache, an der ihnen doch wirklich nicht viel liegen kann, ein wenig unrichtig informiert worden sind.""","""You're my uncle,"" said Karl and kissed his hand and was kissed on the forehead. ""I'm very glad I met you, but you're wrong if you think my parents only say bad things about you. But even apart from that, there were a few mistakes in your speech, i.e. I think it didn't really all happen like that. But you really can't judge things so well from here and I also believe that there is no It will cause particular damage if the gentlemen have been informed a little incorrectly about the details of a matter that really cannot matter to them.""","‘You are my uncle,’ said Karl and kissed his hand, and was kissed on the forehead in return. ‘I’m very glad I’ve met you, but you’re mistaken if you think my parents only say bad things about you. But there were a few other mistakes in what you said, I mean, not everything happened the way you described it. But it’s difficult for you to tell from such a distance and anyway I don’t think it matters if the gentlemen here have been given an account that’s inaccurate in a few points of detail, about something that doesn’t really concern them.’","“You are my uncle,” said Karl, kissing his uncle’s hand and in turn receiving kisses on the forehead. “I’m very pleased to have met you, but you’re mistaken if you think my parents said nothing but bad things about you. But even aside from that, your speech did have a couple of mistakes in it; for instance, I don’t really think that’s how everything happened. Also, you can’t gauge things that well from over here; besides, it’ll be no great harm if the gentlemen were slightly misinformed about an affair that surely means little to them.”"
"„Und hier auf dem Gang ist kein anderes Zimmer zu bekommen?"" fragte Karl.","""And you can't get another room in this corridor?"" asked Karl.",‘And isn’t there any other room to be had on the passage?’ Karl asked.,“And there’s no other room to be had on this corridor?” Karl asked.
"„Gleich Brunelda gleich"", rief Delamarche und eilte mit Karl und Robinson zur Tür. Ehe er sie aber entließ, gab er ihnen den Aufrag das Frühstück zu holen und womöglich von jemandem ein gutes Parfüm für Brunel- da auszuborgen.","""Soon Brunelda soon,"" called Delamarche and hurried to the door with Karl and Robinson. Before he let them go, however, he told them to get breakfast and, if possible, to borrow a good perfume for Brunelda from someone.","‘All right, Brunelda, all right,’ cried Delamarche, and hurried to the door with Karl and Robinson. Before he let them go, though, he instructed them to get some breakfast and if possible to borrow a good perfume for Brunelda.","“I’m coming, Brunelda, I’m coming,” cried Delamarche, rushing to the door with Karl and Robinson. Before releasing them, however, he asked them to fetch breakfast and, if possible, to borrow a good perfume somewhere for Brunelda."
"„Sind Sie fertig?"" fragte Green. „Ja"", sagte Karl, „ha- ben Sie mir den Koffer und den Regenschirm mitge- bracht?"" fragte Karl. „Hier ist er"", sagte Green und stellte Karls alten Reisekoffer, den er bisher mit der li- ken Hand hinter dem Rücken versteckt hatte, neben Karl auf den Boden. „Und den Regenschirm?"" fragte Karl weiter. „Alles hier"", sagte Green und zog auch den Regenschirm hervor, den er in einer Hosentasche hän- gen hatte. „Die Sachen hat ein gewisser Schubal, ein Obermaschinist der Hamburg-Amerikalinie gebracht, er hat behauptet sie auf dem Schiff gefunden zu haben. Sie können ihm bei Gelegenheit danken."" „Nun habe ich wenigstens meine alten Sachen wieder"", sagte Karl und legte den Schirm auf den Koffer. „Sie sollen aber besser in Zukunf auf sie achtgeben, läßt Ihnen der Herr Se- nator sagen"", bemerkte Herr Green und fragte dann of- fenbar aus privater Neugierde: „Was ist das eigentlich für ein merkwürdiger Koffer?"" „Es ist ein Koffer, mit dem die Soldaten in meiner Heimat zum Militär einrük- ken"", antwortete Karl, „es ist der alte Militärkoffer mei- nes Vaters. Er ist sonst ganz praktisch."" Lächelnd fügte er hinzu: „Vorausgesetzt daß man ihn nicht irgendwo stehn läßt."" „Schließlich sind Sie ja belehrt genug"", sagte Herr Green, „und einen zweiten Onkel haben Sie in Amerika wohl nicht. Hier gebe ich Ihnen noch eine Kar- te Dritter nach San Francisko. Ich habe diese Reise für Sie beschlossen, weil erstens die Erwerbsmöglichkeiten im Osten für Sie viel bessere sind und weil zweitens hier in allen Dingen die für Sie in Betracht kommen könnten, Ihr Onkel seine Hände im Spiele hat und ein Zusam- mentreffen unbedingt vermieden werden muß. In Frisco können Sie ganz ungestört arbeiten, fangen Sie nur ruhig ganz unten an und versuchen Sie sich allmählich herauf- zuarbeiten.""","""Are you finished?"" asked Green. ""Yes,"" said Karl, ""did you bring me the suitcase and the umbrella?"" asked Karl. ""Here it is,"" said Green and put Karl's old suitcase, the he had previously hidden with his left hand behind his back, on the floor next to Karl. ""And the umbrella?"" Karl asked further. ""Everything here,"" said Green and also pulled out the umbrella that he had hanging in a trouser pocket. ""The things were brought by a certain Schubal, a chief machinist of the Hamburg-Amerikalinie, he claimed to have found them on the ship. You can thank him when you have a chance."" ""Now at least I have my old things back,"" said Karl and laid the umbrella on the suitcase. ""But you should take better care of them in the future, the senator tells you,"" remarked Mr. Green and then, apparently out of private curiosity, asked: ""What kind of strange suitcase is that?"" ""It's a suitcase that the soldiers in my home country use to enlist,"" answered Karl, ""It's my father's old military suitcase. Otherwise it's very practical."" He added with a smile: ""Provided he isn't left standing somewhere."" ""After all, you've learned enough,"" said Mr. Green, ""and you probably don't have a second uncle in America. Here I give you another card third to San Francisco. I have decided to take this trip for you because, firstly, the employment opportunities in the East are much better for you and, secondly, because your uncle has a hand in everything that could come into consideration for you here and a meeting must be avoided at all costs . In Frisco you can work undisturbed, just start at the bottom and try to work your way up.""","‘Have you finished?’ asked Green. ‘Yes’ said Karl, ‘have you got the suitcase and umbrella for me?’ asked Karl. ‘There you are,’ said Green, and set Karl’s old suitcase, which he had kept hidden behind his back in his left hand, on the floor beside Karl. ‘ And the umbrella?’ asked Karl. ‘It’s all here,’ said Green, and pulled out the umbrella, which was dangling from a trouser pocket. ‘The things were brought in by one Schubal, a chief engineer with the Hamburg–America Line, he claims he found them on the ship. Thank him if you ever get the chance.’ ‘Well, at least I have my old things back,’ said Karl, and laid the umbrella on the suitcase. ‘The Senator suggests you might look after them better in future,’ remarked Mr Green, and then asked, obviously out of personal curiosity: ‘What kind of strange suitcase is that?’ ‘It’s a suitcase that soldiers in my home country enlist with,’ replied Karl, ‘it’s my father’s old army suitcase. It’s very practical.’ Smiling, he added: ‘If you remember not to leave it somewhere.’ ‘Well, you’ve had enough instructions now,’ said Mr Green, ‘ and I don’t suppose you have another uncle in America. Lastly, here is a third-class ticket to San Francisco. I chose that as your destination, firstly because the chances of employment are far better for you in the east, and secondly because your uncle is involved in everything here that you might be considered for, and a meeting is to be avoided at all costs. In Frisco, you’ll be able to work undisturbed, just start at the bottom and gradually work your way up.’","“Are you finished?” asked Green. “Yes,” said Karl. “Have you brought my trunk and my umbrella?” asked Karl. “Here it is,” said Green, and he took Karl’s old trunk, which he had hidden with his left hand behind his back, and put it on the floor beside Karl. “And the umbrella?” Karl insisted. “It’s all here,” said Green, and he pulled out the umbrella, which he had hung from one of his trousers pockets. “A certain Schubal, a chief machinist of the Hamburg Amerika Line, brought your belongings, claiming to have found them on the ship. You can thank him at some point.” “At least I now have my old belongings again,” said Karl, laying his umbrella on the trunk. “But the senator would like to inform you that you should treat them more carefully in the future,” declared Mr. Green, and then, evidently out of sheer curiosity, he asked: “ But what’s that odd-looking trunk?” “It’s the trunk that the soldiers in my homeland have to carry when they report for duty,” answered Karl. “It’s my father’s old army trunk. It’s extremely practical in other ways too.” He added with a smile: “Unless one happens to leave it lying about.” “You’ve learned a lesson at last,” said Mr. Green, “and you probably don’t have a second uncle in America. I’m also giving you a third-class ticket to San Francisco. I decided that you should go there, first because you’ll have better employment prospects in the East, and second because your uncle has his hand in everything you could be considered for here, and we must absolutely avoid the possibility of your meeting again. In ’Frisco you can work away undisturbed, just start off quietly at the very bottom and try to work your way up bit by bit.”"
"„Ja"", sagte Karl, „aber was für Dich gilt, muß doch noch nicht für mich gelten. Überhaupt gilt so etwas nur für den, der es sich gefallen läßt.""","""Yes,"" said Karl, ""but what applies to you doesn't necessarily apply to me. In general, something like that only applies to someone who puts up with it.""","‘Yes,’ said Karl, ‘but what applies to you doesn’t have to apply to me as well. Besides these sort of things only hold good if you agree to be bound by them.’","“Yes,” said Karl, “but what’s true for you isn’t necessarily true for me. Besides, that is true only for those who are prepared to put up with that kind of thing.”"
Karl sah an einer Straßenecke …,Karl saw on a street corner...,"On a street corner, Karl saw a poster with the following announcement: ‘At the racecourse in Clayton, today from 6 a.m. till midnight, personnel is being hired for the Theatre in Oklahoma!",____________
"Glücklicherweise hatte Brunelda Hunger. Wohlgefäl- lig nickte sie Karl zu, während er alles vorbereitete und öfers hinderte sie ihn, indem sie vorzeitig mit ihrer wei- chen fetten womöglich gleich alles zerdrückenden Hand irgendeinen Bissen für sich hervorholte. „Er hat es gut gemacht"", sagte sie schmatzend und zog Delamarche, der den Kamm in ihrem Haar für die spätere Arbeit stecken ließ, neben sich auf einen Sessel nieder. Auch Delamarche wurde im Anblick des Essens freundlich, beide waren sehr hungrig, ihre Hände eilten kreuz und quer über das Tischchen. Karl erkannte, daß man hier um zu befriedigen nur immer möglichst viel bringen mußte und in Erinnerung daran, daß er in der Küche noch verschiedene brauchbare Eßware auf dem Boden liegen gelassen hatte, sagte er: „Zum erstenmal habe ich nicht gewußt, wie alles eingerichtet werden soll, näch- stes Mal werde ich es besser machen."" Aber noch wäh- rend des Redens erinnerte er sich, zu wem er sprach, er war zusehr von der Sache selbst befangen gewesen. Bru- nelda nickte Delamarche befriedigt zu und reichte Karl zum Lohn eine Handvoll Keks.","Luckily Brunelda was hungry. She nodded happily to Karl while he was preparing everything and she often prevented him by prematurely pulling out a morsel for himself with her soft, fat hand, which might have crushed everything. ""He did well,"" she said with a smack and pulled Delamarche, who left the comb in her hair for later work, down on a chair next to her. Delamarche, too, became friendly at the sight of the meal, both were very hungry, hers Hands flew back and forth across the little table. Karl realized that in order to be satisfied, one always had to bring as much as possible, and remembering that he had left various usable food on the floor in the kitchen, he said: ""For First time I didn't know how to set everything up, next time I'll do better."" But even as he was speaking he remembered to whom he was speaking, he had been too self-conscious about the matter itself. Brunelda gave Delamarche a satisfied nod and handed Karl a handful of biscuits as a reward.","Luckily, Brunelda was hungry. She nodded graciously at Karl, as he set everything out, and often got in his way by filching little morsels for herself before he was ready, with her soft, fat, potentially all-flattening hand. ‘ He’s done well,’ she said, smacking her lips, and pulled Delamarche, who left the comb in her hair for a later resumption, down next to her on a chair. Delamarche too was mollified by the sight of the meal, both of them were very hungry, their hands hurried this way and that across the little table. Karl saw that to give satisfaction he should be sure to bring as much as possible, and, remembering he had left various eatables on the floor of the kitchen, he said: ‘For this first time, I wasn’t sure how to go about it, next time I’ll do better.’ But even as he spoke, he remembered whom he was addressing, he had concentrated too much on the thing itself. Brunelda nodded contentedly at Delamarche, and fed Karl a handful of crumbs by way of reward.","Fortunately, Brunelda was hungry. Though nodding agreeably at Karl as he prepared everything, she frequently hindered him by picking out little mouthfuls prematurely with her soft fat hand, possibly squashing everything. “He did a good job,” she said, smacking her lips, and drew Delamarche, who had left the comb in her hair for possible later use, onto a chair beside her. At the sight of the food even Delamarche became friendly; both were very hungry, and their hands rushed to and fro over the little table. Karl realized that if one wished to satisfy these people, one always had to bring back all one could and, remembering that he had left various usable food items lying about on the floor, said: “This first time I didn’t know how everything should be set up, but I’ll do a better job next time.” Yet even as he spoke he remembered whom he was addressing; he had become much too caught up in the details of this affair. Brunelda nodded contentedly at Delamarche and rewarded Karl by passing him a handful of biscuits."

"Nun konnte sich der Oberportier wenigstens austo- ben, was ihm beim Reden nicht hatte gelingen wollen. Er hielt Karl oben am Arm fest, aber nicht etwa mit ruhigem Griff, der schließlich auszuhalten gewesen wä- re, sondern er lockerte hie und da den Griff und machte ihn dann mit Steigerung fester und fester, was bei seinen großen Körperkräfen gar nicht aufzuhören schien und ein Dunkel vor Karls Augen verursachte. Aber er hielt Karl nicht nur, sondern als hätte er auch den Befehl bekommen ihn gleichzeitig zu strecken, zog er ihn auch hie und da in die Höhe und schüttelte ihn, wobei er immer wieder halb fragend zum Oberkellner sagte: „Ob ich ihn jetzt nur nicht verwechsle, ob ich ihn jetzt nur nicht verwechsle.""","Now the head porter could at least let off steam, which he hadn't been able to do while talking. He held Karl by the upper arm, but not with a steady grip, which in the end could have been endured, but he loosened his grip here and there and then made it tighter and tighter with increasing strength, which seemed to never end given his great physical strength and caused a darkness before Karl's eyes. But he not only held Karl, but as if he had also received the order to stretch him at the same time, he also pulled him up every now and then and shook him, always saying half questioningly to the head waiter: ""Would I just like to hold him now? don't confuse it, if only I don't confuse it now.""","Now at least the Head Porter could get something out of his system that his words hadn’t succeeded in doing. He gripped Karl’s upper arm, but not with a steady grip, which could have been borne, but periodically loosening it and then gradually making it tighter and tighter, which, with his great strength, seemed to have no limit, and made Karl see stars. Nor was he content to hold him, but, as though he had been ordered to stretch him at the same time, he lifted him up in the air from time to time and shook him, and half-inquired of the Head Waiter: ‘I’m not mistaking him for someone else now, am I, I’m not mistaking him.’","Now the head porter could at least let off steam, which he had not managed to do as he spoke. He seized Karl by his upper arm, not with a steady grip, which would have been bearable, but rather by loosening his grip and then gradually tightening it, which on account of his great physical strength felt as if it would never cease and caused a darkening of Karl’s vision. Yet he not only held Karl but pulled him up in the air and shook him, as though he had also been given orders to stretch out his body, while telling the head waiter repeatedly, almost as a question: “So I’m confusing him now, so I’m confusing him now.”"
"Da rief aus dem Zimmer eine fragende Stimme in sanf- tem müdem Tonfall: „Delamarche?"" „Ja"", antwortete Delamarche und sah freundlich die Tür an, „können wir eintreten?"" „O ja"", hieß es und Delamarche öffnete, nachdem er noch die zwei hinter ihm Wartenden mit einem Blick gestreif hatte, langsam die Tür.","Then a questioning voice called out from the room in a soft, tired tone: ""Delamarche?"" ""Yes,"" answered Delamarche and looked at the door in a friendly manner, ""can we come in?"" ""Oh yes,"" they said, and Delamarche opened it afterwards he had glanced at the two people waiting behind him, slowly closed the door.","Just then a tired voice in mild and gentle tones inquired from within: ‘Delamarche?’ ‘Yes,’ answered Delamarche, and smiled at the door, ‘may we come in?’ ‘Oh yes,’ came the reply, and after briefly glaring at the other two waiting behind him, Delamarche slowly opened the door.","Just then an inquiring voice asked gently if wearily: “Delamarche?” “Yes,” answered Delamarche, looking at the door with a friendly mien, “may we come in?” “Oh yes,” came the answer, and then, after pausing to glance at the two others waiting behind him, Delamarche slowly opened the door."
"Karl beeilte sich wie er nur konnte, um nur beim Haupttor eine Belästigung zu vermeiden, aber es gieng alles viel langsamer, als er wollte. Zuerst war Bess nicht gleich zu finden und jetzt in der Frühstückszeit war alles voll Menschen, dann zeigte sich, daß ein Junge sich Karls alte Hosen ausgeborgt hatte und Karl mußte die Kleiderständer bei fast allen Betten absuchen, ehe er die- se Hosen fand, so daß wohl fünf Minuten vergangen waren, ehe Karl zum Haupttor kam. Gerade vor ihm gieng eine Dame mitten zwischen vier Herren. Sie gien- gen alle auf ein großes Automobil zu, das sie erwartete und dessen Schlag bereits ein Lakai geöffnet hielt wäh- rend er den freien linken Arm seitwärts wagrecht und steif ausstreckte, was höchst feierlich aussah. Aber Karl hatte umsonst gehof, hinter dieser vornehmen Gesell- schaf unbemerkt hinauszukommen. Schon faßte ihn der Oberportier bei der Hand und zog ihn zwischen zwei Herren hindurch, die er um Verzeihung bat, zu sich hin. Das soll eine Viertelminute gewesen sein"", sagte er und sah Karl von der Seite an, als beobachte er eine schlecht gehende Uhr. „Komm einmal her"", sagte er dann und führte ihn in die große Portiersloge, die Karl zwar schon längst einmal anzusehen Lust gehabt hatte, in die er aber jetzt von dem Portier geschoben nur mit Mißtrauen ein- trat. Er war schon in der Tür, als er sich umwendete und den Versuch machte, den Oberportier wegzuschieben und wegzukommen. „Nein, nein, hier geht man hinein"", sagte der Oberportier und drehte Karl um. „Ich bin doch schon entlassen"", sagte Karl und meinte damit, daß ihm im Hotel niemand mehr etwas zu befehlen habe. Solange ich Dich halte bist Du nicht entlassen"", sagte der Portier, was allerdings auch richtig war.","Karl hurried as he could to avoid harassment only at the main gate, but everything went much slower than he wanted. At first Bess couldn't be found right away and now at breakfast time everything was full of people, then it turned out that a boy had borrowed Karl's old trousers and Karl had to search the clothes racks by almost every bed before he found these trousers, like that that five minutes must have passed before Karl came to the main gate. Just in front of him was walking a lady in the midst of four gentlemen. They all walked toward a large automobile awaiting them, the door of which a footman was already holding open while stretching out his free left arm sideways, horizontal and stiff, in what looked most solemn. But Karl had hoped in vain to get out behind this distinguished company unnoticed. The head porter was already taking him by the hand and pulling him towards him between two gentlemen whom he begged for forgiveness. That's supposed to have been a quarter of a minute,"" he said, looking sideways at Karl as if he were watching a clock that was going badly. ""Come over here,"" he then said and led him into the large porter's box, which Karl had long looked at had felt like it, but now, pushed by the porter, he only entered with suspicion. He was already in the door when he turned and tried to push the head porter away and get away. ""No, no, you go in here,"" said the head porter and turned Karl around. ""I've already been dismissed,"" said Karl, meaning that no one in the hotel had to give him orders anymore. As long as I'm holding you, you're not fired,"" said the doorman, which was also correct.","Karl hurried as much as he could, to avoid a scene at the main entrance, but everything took much longer than he meant it to. To begin with, Bess couldn’t be met with right away, and as it was now breakfast time there were people everywhere, and then it turned out that another boy had borrowed Karl’s old trousers, and Karl was forced to look through most of the clothes stands next to the beds before he could find them, so that five minutes must have elapsed before Karl reached the main entrance. In front of him was a lady, accompanied by four gentlemen. They all went up to a large automobile which was waiting for them, and whose rear doors were being held open by a lackey who had his left arm extended stiffly behind him, which looked terribly impressive. But Karl’s hope to slip out unobserved with this posh group was a vain one. The Head Porter had him by the hand and pulled him out between two of the gentlemen, begging their pardon as he did. ‘That was never a quarter of a minute,’ he said and looked askance at Karl, like a man inspecting a faulty watch. ‘ Come in here will you,’ he said, and led him into the large porter’s lodge, which Karl had been longing to see for ages, but which he now entered, propelled by the porter, full only of suspicion. He was already in the doorway when he turned round and tried to push the porter aside and get away. ‘ Oh no you don’t, this is the way in,’ said the Head Porter, spinning Karl round again. ‘But I’ve already been dismissed,’ said Karl, implying that no one in the hotel could order him about any longer. ‘As long as I’ve got you in my grip, you’re not dismissed,’ said the porter, which was indeed the case.","Karl hurried along as fast as he could, simply in order to avoid being pestered at the main gate, but everything took a great deal longer than he had wished. First Bess could not be found, there were of course people everywhere since it was breakfast time, then it turned out that a boy had borrowed Karl’s old trousers, and Karl was therefore obliged to search through the clothes stands at the foot of virtually every bed until he found his trousers, so that five minutes had probably elapsed before Karl reached the main gate. Walking just ahead of him was a lady flanked by four gentlemen. They approached a large waiting automobile, the door to which was held open by a footman who held his free left arm stretched out stiffly to the side, which looked most formal. Karl had in vain hoped to slip out behind those elegant people without being observed. The head porter now seized him by the hand, drawing him in between two gentlemen, to whom he apologized. “You call that a quarter of a minute,” said the head porter, looking sideways at Karl, as though at a malfunctioning clock. “So come here,” he said, and led him into the large porter’s lodge, which Karl had always wanted to explore, but now that he was being pushed in by the porter, he entered it most mistrustfully. He had already reached the doorway when he turned around and tried to push aside the head porter and get away. “No, no, it’s this way,” said the head porter, and spun Karl around. “But I’ve been dismissed,” said Karl, meaning that he no longer had to take orders from anybody at the hotel. “Well, you’ve not been dismissed as long as I’m still holding you,” said the head porter, which was certainly true too."

"„Du verrennst Dich immer mehr"", sagte der Ober- kellner. „Wenn man Dir glauben sollte, müßte man im- mer das was Du früher gesagt hast vergessen.

Aber wir haben hier kein Antwort- und Frage- spiel, sondern wollen Deine Rechtfertigung hören. Zu- erst aber wolltest Du das Geld nicht holen, sondern ihm Dein heutiges Trinkgeld geben, dann aber zeigt sich, daß Du dieses Geld noch bei Dir hast, also offenbar doch noch anderes Geld holen wolltest, wofür auch Dein lan- ges Ausbleiben spricht. Schließlich wäre es ja nichts Be- sonderes, wenn Du für ihn aus Deinem Koffer hättest Geld holen wollen, daß Du es aber mit aller Kraf leug- nest, das ist allerdings etwas Besonderes. Ebenso wie Du auch immerfort verschweigen willst, daß Du den Mann erst hier im Hotel betrunken gemacht hast, woran ja nicht der geringste Zweifel ist, denn Du selbst hast zuge- geben, daß er allein gekommen ist, aber nicht allein weg- gehn konnte und er selbst hat ja im Schlafsaal herumge- schrien, daß er Dein Gast ist. Fraglich also bleiben jetzt nur noch zwei Dinge, die Du, wenn Du die Sache ver- einfachen willst, selbst beantworten kannst, die man aber schließlich auch ohne Deine Mithilfe wird feststel- len können: Erstens wie hast Du Dir den Zutritt zu den Vorratskammern verschaf und zweitens wieso hast Du verschenkbares Geld angesammelt?""","""You're getting more and more lost,"" said the head waiter. ""If anyone were to believe you, one would always have to forget what you said earlier. So first you have the man - I don't even believe you the name Robinson, no Irishman has been called that since there has been an Ireland – so at first you just took him to the dormitory, for which, by the way, you could fly out in a hurry – but at first you didn’t promise him money, then again if someone surprised you asks, you promised him money. But we don't have an answer and question game here, we want to hear your justification. At first you didn't want to get the money, but gave him today's tip, but then it shows that you still have this money with you, so obviously you wanted to get other money after all, which your long absence also speaks for. After all, it wouldn't be anything special if you'd wanted to get money out of your suitcase for him, that But you do deny it with all your might, but that is something special. Just as you always want to keep quiet about the fact that you only got the man drunk here in the hotel, of which there is not the slightest doubt, because you yourself admitted that he came alone, but couldn't leave alone and he himself was shouting around in the dormitory that he was your guest. So there are only two questions that remain, which you can answer yourself if you want to simplify things, but which can ultimately also be determined without your help: First, how did you gain access to the pantries and second, why did you accumulate giftable money?""","‘That’s a tangled web you’re weaving,’ said the Head Waiter. ‘In order to believe anything you say, one would have to forget whatever else you had said before. First of all you took the fellow – I don’t believe he’s called Robinson, no Irishman in that country ’s history has ever been called Robinson – first of all, you only took him to the dormitory, which is enough in itself to have you out on your ear – but without promising him money, then another question catches you out, and you say you did promise him money. But this isn’t a question and answer session, we’re here to let you justify yourself. Now first you didn’t want to get the money, but give him your tips, but then it appears that you still have them on your person, so you obviously had need of other money, for which your long absence argues too. For me there’d be nothing out of the ordinary if you’d wanted to get him some money out of your box, but the vehemence with which you deny that is quite extraordinary. As is the way you kept seeking to deny that you made the man drunk here in the hotel, of which there isn’t the slightest doubt, because you yourself conceded that he arrived on his own, but couldn’t leave on his own, and he himself was shouting in the dormitory that he was your guest. So two things remain at issue, which, if you want to simplify matters, you can answer yourself, but which can also be determined without any assistance from you: first, how did you gain access to the storerooms, and second, how did you come by money to give away?’","“You keep getting lost,” said the head waiter. “To be able to believe what you say, one would continually need to forget what you just said. So first you took that man—I can’t even believe you when you say his name is Robinson; ever since Ireland has existed, there’s never been an Irishman of that name —first you say that you merely took him into the dormitory, which is, by the way, already sufficient to get you thrown out at once—and that you didn’t initially promise him any money, but then when one surprises you with the question, you admit that you did promise him some money. But this isn’t a question-and-answer game; we want to hear your justification for your actions. At first you didn’t want to fetch the money and instead give him tips for today, but then it turns out that you do still have that money on you, so you obviously did intend to fetch more money, and your lengthy absence supports this interpretation. Finally, there would really be nothing odd about your wanting to fetch more money from your trunk for him, but it’s certainly odd that you’re trying to deny this so emphatically. Just as you seek the whole time to conceal the fact that you made the man drunk at the hotel, and there can be no doubt whatsoever about this since you yourself admitted that he came on his own but was unable to leave on his own, and of course, in the dormitory he himself shouted out that he was your guest. So there are only two questions that must still be clarified, which, if you wish to simplify the affair, you can answer yourself; besides, we can establish this without your help. First, how did you succeed in gaining access to the pantries, and second, how did you amass enough money to be able to give some away?”"
"Karl stand eng ans Buffet gedrängt, denn kaum hatte er sich angestellt, war hinter ihm ein Tisch aufgestellt worden und der eine der dort sich niederlassenden Gäste streife schon, wenn er sich nur ein wenig beim Reden zurückbog, mit seinem großen Hut Karls Rücken. Und dabei war so wenig Hoffnung vom Kellner etwas zu bekommen, selbst als die beiden plumpen Nachbarn be- friedigt weggegangen waren. Einigemal hatte Karl einen Kellner über den Tisch hin bei der Schürze gefaßt, aber immer hatte sich der mit verzerrtem Gesicht losgerissen. Keiner war zu halten, sie liefen nur und liefen nur. Wenn wenigstens in der Nähe Karls etwas Passendes zum Es- sen und Trinken gewesen wäre, er hätte es genommen, sich nach dem Preis erkundigt, das Geld hingelegt und wäre mit Freude weggegangen. Aber gerade vor ihm lagen nur Schüsseln mit häringsartigen Fischen, deren schwarze Schuppen am Rande goldig glänzten. Die konnten sehr teuer sein und würden wahrscheinlich nie- manden sättigen. Außerdem waren kleine Fäßchen mit Rum erreichbar, aber Rum wollte er seinen Kameraden nicht bringen, sie schienen schon so wie so bei jeder Gelegenheit nur auf den koncentriertesten Alkohol aus- zugehn und darin wollte er sie nicht noch unterstützen. Es blieb also Karl nichts übrig als einen andern Platz zu suchen und mit seinen Bemühungen von vorne anzufangen. Nun war aber auch schon die Zeit sehr vor- gerückt. Die Uhr am andern Ende des Saales, deren Zei- ger man beim scharfen Hinsehn durch den Rauch gerade noch erkennen konnte, zeigte schon neun vorüber. An- derswo am Buffet war aber das Gedränge noch größer als an dem früheren ein wenig abgelegenen Platz. Außer- dem füllte sich der Saal desto mehr, je später es wurde. Immer wieder zogen durch die Haupttüre mit großem Halloh neue Gäste ein. An manchen Stellen räumten Gäste selbstherrlich das Buffet ab, setzten sich aufs Pult und tranken einander zu; es waren die besten Plätze, man übersah den ganzen Saal.","Karl was crowded close to the buffet, because he had scarcely gotten in line when a table was set up behind him and one of the guests seated there brushed Karl's back with his large hat if he leaned back a little while speaking. And yet there was so little hope of getting anything from the waiter, even when the two clumsy neighbors had left satisfied. A few times Karl had grabbed a waiter by the apron across the table, but he had always torn himself away with a contorted face. Nobody could be stopped, they just ran and just ran. If at least there had been something suitable to eat and drink near Karl, he would have taken it, asked the price, put the money down and left happily. But just in front of him were only bowls with herring-like fish, their black scales gleaming golden at the rim. They could be very expensive and would probably not satisfy anyone. Small kegs of rum were also within reach, but he didn't want to bring rum to his comrades, they seemed to go for the most concentrated alcohol at every opportunity, and he didn't want to support them any further. So Karl had no choice but to look for another place and start all over again. But now the time was very advanced. The clock at the other end of the room, whose hands you could just make out through the smoke if you looked closely, showed nine past. Elsewhere at the buffet, however, the crowd was even bigger than at the earlier, somewhat isolated place. In addition, the room filled up more and more the later it got. Again and again new guests moved in through the main door with a big hello. In some places, guests self-importantly cleared the buffet, sat down on the desk and drank to each other; they were the best seats, you could see the whole hall.","Karl stood pressed against the buffet, because no sooner had he reached it, than another table was set up immediately behind him, and one of the customers sitting down at it brushed Karl’s back with the broad brim of his hat each time he threw his head back while speaking. But there was so little hope of getting anything from the waiters, even once his two rude neighbours had gone away satisfied. A few times Karl had reached across the table and grabbed at a waiter’s apron, but it was simply torn free with an angry frown. You couldn’t get a grip on any of them, all they did was keep running and running. If there had been anything suitable to eat and drink anywhere near Karl he would simply have taken it, asked how much it cost, paid and gone away happily. But the dishes in front of him were full of some herring-like fish, with black scales that had a golden gleam at the edges. They might be very expensive and probably wouldn’t satisfy anyone’s hunger. And to drink there were only little barrels of rum, and he wasn’t taking any rum back to his companions, they seemed avid enough as it was for the most highly concentrated alcoholic drinks, and he wasn’t about to help them in their quest. So Karl had no option but to look for another place, and begin afresh. But a lot of time had passed. The clock at the other end of the room, whose hands could just be made out through the smoke if you looked hard, showed that it was already past nine o’clock. Elsewhere at the buffet the crush was even greater than at his previous, somewhat marginal position. Besides, the room seemed to be filling up more and more as it got later. New guests kept coming through the main doors with a great commotion. At some points, the guests simply cleared the buffet, sat down on the tables, and toasted one another; they were the best places, from there they could see across the whole room.","Karl stood tightly pressed against the buffet, for no sooner had he stood in line than a table was set up behind him, and whenever the guest seated there leaned back as he spoke, he brushed against Karl’s back with his large hat. And yet there was so little hope of obtaining anything from the waiter, even after Karl’s two plump neighbors had gone away happily. On several occasions Karl had reached across the table and seized a waiter by the apron, but each time the waiter had torn himself away with a grimace. Not a single one could be stopped—they simply ran and ran. If only there had been something suitable to eat and drink in Karl ’s vicinity, he would have taken it, asked the price, paid up, and left feeling very pleased. But all he saw were dishes full of herringlike fish with black scales, the edges of which shone like gold. Those could be very expensive and would surely not satisfy anybody. Besides, there were a few small bottles of rum within reach, but he did not want to take any rum back to his comrades, for already at every opportunity they went only for the most concentrated alcohol, and he did not wish to encourage them any further. Karl therefore had no alternative but to seek another spot and to exert himself anew. But it was now very late. The clock at the other end of the hall, whose hands one could barely discern through the smoke, indicated that it was already after nine. But elsewhere at the buffet the crush was even greater than at his previous spot, which was a little out of the way. Besides, the later it got, the more crowded the hall became. New guests were continually entering through the main door, shouting hello. Several guests imperiously cleared off the buffet, sat down at the counter, raised their glasses, and drank to one another; those were the best places, for one could see out over the entire hall."
"„Und alles habe ich vor dreißig Jahren selbst einge- richtet, mußt Du wissen. Ich hatte damals im Hafenvier- tel ein kleines Geschäf und wenn dort im Tag fünf Ki- sten abgeladen waren, so war es viel und ich gieng aufge- blasen nachhause. Heute habe ich die drittgrößten La- gerhäuser im Hafen und jener Laden ist das Eßzimmer und die Gerätkammer der fünfundsechzigsten Gruppe meiner Packträger.""","“And I set everything up myself thirty years ago, you know. At that time I had a small business in the harbor district and if five crates were unloaded there a day, that was a lot and I went home puffed up. Today I have the third largest warehouses in the port, and that store is the dining room and tool room of the sixty-fifth group of my porters.""","‘And, you know, I set it all up myself thirty years ago. I owned a little store in the harbour district, and if five chests were unloaded there in the course of a day, that was a lot, and I would go home feeling very full of myself. Today I own the third largest warehouse in the port, and that shop now serves as the canteen and tool room for the sixty-fifth group of my dockworkers.’","“And I set all of this up thirty years ago by myself, I’d like you to know. Back then I had a small concern in the harbor district, and if five cases were unloaded on any given day, that was a lot, and I went home feeling all puffed up. Today I have the third-largest warehouse in the harbor, and the old shop serves as the dining room and tool shed for my sixty-fifth company of porters.”"
"Hier unterbrach sich der Oberkellner, denn die sicht- lich bleich gewordene Oberköchin erhob sich vom Ses- sel, den sie ein wenig zurückstieß. „Ich verschone Sie mit dem weitern"", sagte der Oberkellner. „Nein bitte nein"", sagte die Oberköchin und ergriff seine Hand, „erzählen Sie nur weiter, ich will alles hören, darum bin ich ja hier."" Der Oberportier, der vortrat und sich zum Zeichen dessen, daß er von Anfang an alles durchschaut hatte, laut auf die Brust schlug, wurde vom Oberkellner mit den Worten: „Ja Sie hatten ganz recht Feodor!"" gleichzeitig beruhigt und zurückgewiesen.","Here the head waiter interrupted himself, because the head cook, who had visibly turned pale, got up from the chair, which she pushed back a little. ""I'll spare you the rest,"" said the head waiter. ""No, please no,"" said the head cook and took his hand, ""just go on, I want to hear everything, that's why I'm here."" The head porter, who stepped forward and hitting his chest loudly as a sign of the fact that he had seen through everything from the start was greeted by the head waiter with the words: ""Yes, you were quite right, Feodor!"" reassured and rejected at the same time.","At this point the Head Waiter broke off, because the Head Cook, now visibly pale, had risen from her chair, pushing it back a little. ‘I’ll spare you the rest,’ said the Head Waiter. ‘No, no, please,’ said the Head Cook, taking his hand, ‘go on, I want to hear everything, that’s what I’m here for.’ The Head Porter, who stepped forward, and, in indication of the fact that he had seen it all coming, beat his breast loudly, was simultaneously rebuked and pacified by the Head Waiter ’s words: ‘Yes, Feodor, you were absolutely right!’","Just then the head waiter interrupted what he was saying, since the head cook, who had grown visibly pale, rose from his chair, which she pushed back a little. “I shall spare you the rest,” said the head waiter. “No, please, no,” said the head cook, seizing his hand. “Go on, I want to hear everything, that’s why I’ve come.” The head porter stepped forward and, so as to signal that he had seen through everything from the outset, beat himself loudly on the breast, whereupon the head waiter addressed him with the words: “Yes, you were quite right, Feodor!” calming him down while upbraiding him also."
"Und nun war er es, der die beiden andern zog und sie freuten sich so sehr über seinen Eifer, daß sie ohne sich erst bitten zu lassen, den Koffer abwechselnd trugen und Karl gar nicht recht verstand, womit er ihnen eigentlich diese große Freude verursache. Sie kamen in eine anstei- gende Gegend und wenn sie hie und da stehen blieben, konnten sie beim Rückblick das Panorama New Yorks und seines Hafens immer ausgedehnter sich entwickeln sehn. Die Brücke, die New York mit Boston verbindet hieng zart über den Hudson und sie erzitterte, wenn man die Augen klein machte. Sie schien ganz ohne Ver- kehr zu sein und unter ihr spannte sich das unbelebte glatte Wasserband. Alles in beiden Riesenstädten schien leer und nutzlos aufgestellt. Unter den Häusern gab es kaum einen Unterschied zwischen den großen und den kleinen. In der unsichtbaren Tiefe der Straßen gieng wahrscheinlich das Leben fort nach seiner Art, aber über ihnen war nichts zu sehen, als leichter Dunst, der sich zwar nicht bewegte, aber ohne Mühe zu verjagen schien. Selbst in dem Hafen, dem größten der Welt, war Ruhe eingekehrt und nur hie und da glaubte man, wohl beein- flußt von der Erinnerung an einen früheren Anblick aus der Nähe, ein Schiff zu sehn, das eine kurze Strecke sich fortschob. Aber man konnte ihm auch nicht lange fol- gen, es entgieng den Augen und war nicht mehr zu finden.","And now it was he who pulled the other two, and they were so happy about his enthusiasm that they took turns carrying the suitcase without being asked, and Karl didn't quite understand how he was actually causing them such great joy. They were coming into an uphill region, and pausing here and there, looking back, they could see the panorama of New York and its harbor developing ever more extensively. The bridge that connects New York to Boston hung delicately across the Hudson and it trembled when you narrowed your eyes. It seemed to have no traffic at all, and beneath it stretched the inanimate, smooth ribbon of water. Everything in both giant cities seemed empty and useless. Among the houses there was little difference between the large and the small. In the invisible depths of the streets life was probably going on in its own way, but nothing could be seen above them but a light haze that didn't move, but seemed to dissipate without effort. Even in the harbour, the largest in the world, calm had fallen, and only here and there, probably influenced by the memory of an earlier close-up sight, did one seem to see a ship moving a short distance. But you couldn't follow it for long either, it eluded your eyes and could no longer be found.","And now it was his turn to pull the others along, and they were so pleased with his eagerness that, quite unasked, they took it in turns to carry his suitcase, and Karl didn’t understand what he had done to make them so happy. The road started to climb and when they stopped from time to time they could see, looking back, the panorama of New York and its harbour continually unfolding. The bridge that connected New York with Boston lay slender across the Hudson, and trembled if you narrowed your eyes. It seemed to be carrying no traffic at all, and below it was the smooth unanimated ribbon of water. Everything in both metropolises seemed empty, useless construction. There was almost no distinction to be drawn between the big buildings and the little ones. In the invisible canyons of the streets, life probably continued on its way, but above them there was nothing to be seen except a thin haze which didn’t move, but seemed easy enough to dispel. Even in the harbour, the world’s largest, peace had returned, and only sporadically did one have the impression, probably influenced by earlier, closer views, that one could see a ship sliding forward a little. But it was impossible to trace, because it eluded one’s eyes and couldn’t be found again.","And now he was pulling the other two, who were so pleased with his eagerness that, without waiting to be asked, they took turns carrying the trunk; Karl could not quite understand precisely how he gave them such great pleasure. They arrived in a region that sloped upward, and each time they halted and looked back, they could see the panorama of New York, with its harbor, stretching out ever farther. The bridge connecting New York to Boston hung delicately over the Hudson and trembled if one narrowed one’s eyes. It appeared to bear no traffic, and a long, smooth, lifeless strip of water stretched out underneath. In both of these giant cities everything appeared empty and erected to no avail. And there was scarcely any difference between large and small buildings. Down in the invisible depths of the streets life probably went on as usual, but all they could see above them was a light haze that was motionless yet seemed easy to chase away. Peace had even descended on the harbor, the largest in the world, and only here and there—perhaps influenced by the memory of vessels seen from close up—could one see a ship dragging itself forward a little. Yet one could not follow it for long; it escaped one’s gaze and disappeared."
"Kaum war er zwei Sprünge weit gekommen – daran, daß man seinen Namen gerufen hatte hatte er schon wieder vergessen, nun pfiff auch der zweite Polizei- mann, man merkte seine unverbrauchte Kraf, ferne Pas- santen in dieser Quergasse schienen eine raschere Gang- art anzunehmen – da griff aus einer kleinen Haustüre eine Hand nach Karl und zog ihn mit den Worten „Still sein"" in einen dunklen Flur. Es war Delamarche, ganz außer Athem, mit erhitzten Wangen, seine Haare kleb- ten ihm rings um den Kopf. Den Schlafrock trug er unter dem Arm und war nur mit Hemd und Unterhose bekleidet. Die Türe, welche nicht das eigentliche Haus- tor war, sondern nur einen unscheinbaren Nebenein- gang bildete, hatte er gleich geschlossen und versperrt. „Einen Augenblick"", sagte er dann, lehnte sich mit hochgehaltenem Kopf an die Wand und atmete schwer. Karl lag fast in seinem Arm und drückte halb besin- nungslos das Gesicht an seine Brust. „Da laufen die Herren"", sagte Delamarche und streckte den Finger auf- horchend gegen die Tür. Wirklich liefen jetzt die zwei Polizeileute vorbei, ihr Laufen klang in der leeren Gasse, wie wenn Stahl gegen Stein geschlagen wird. „Du bist aber ordentlich hergenommen"", sagte Delamarche zu Karl, der noch immer an seinem Athem würgte und kein Wort herausbringen konnte. Delamarche setzte ihn vor- sichtig auf den Boden, kniete neben ihm nieder, strich ihm mehrmals über die Stirn und beobachtete ihn. „Jetzt geht es schon"", sagte endlich Karl und stand mühsam auf. „Dann also los"", sagte Delamarche, der seinen Schlafrock wieder angezogen hatte und schob Karl, der noch vor Schwäche den Kopf gesenkt hielt, vor sich her. Von Zeit zu Zeit schüttelte er Karl, um ihn frischer zu machen. „Du willst müde sein?"" sagte er. „Du konntest doch im Freien laufen wie ein Pferd, ich aber mußte hier durch die verf luchten Gänge und Höfe schleichen. Glücklicher Weise bin ich aber auch ein Läufer."" Vor Stolz gab er Karl einen weit ausgeholten Schlag auf den Rücken. „Von Zeit zu Zeit ist ein solches Wettrennen mit der Polizei eine gute Übung."" „Ich war schon müde, wie ich zu laufen anfieng"", sagte Karl. „Für schlechtes Laufen gibt es keine Entschuldigung"", sagte Dela- marche. „Wenn ich nicht wäre, hätten sie Dich schon längst gefaßt."" „Ich glaube auch"", sagte Karl. „Ich bin Ihnen sehr verpflichtet."" „Kein Zweifel"", sagte Dela- marche.","He had scarcely gotten two jumps – he had already forgotten that his name had been called, now the second policeman whistled too, one could tell his fresh energy, distant passers-by in this side street seemed to be walking faster - then a hand reached out of a small front door for Karl and with the words ""Be quiet"" pulled him into a dark corridor. It was Delamarche, completely out of breath, with flushed cheeks, his hair sticking all around his head. He was carrying his dressing-gown under his arm and was only wearing a shirt and underpants. He had immediately closed and locked the door, which was not the actual front door but only an inconspicuous side entrance. ""One moment,"" said he then, leaned against the wall with his head held high and breathed heavily. Karl was almost in his arms and, half senseless, pressed his face to his chest. ""There the gentlemen are running,"" said Delamarche, and stretched his finger towards the door, listening intently. The two policemen actually ran past now, their running sounded in the empty alley as if steel were being struck against stone ' said Delamarche to Karl, who was still choking on his breath and couldn't get a word out. Delamarche put him carefully on the ground, knelt down beside him, stroked his forehead several times and watched him. ""It's all right now,"" said Karl at last, and got up with difficulty. ""Let's go then,"" said Delamarche, who had put his dressing gown back on and was pushing Karl, who was still bowing his head from weakness, in front of him. From time to time he shook Karl to freshen him up. ""You want to be tired?"" he said. ""You could run like a horse in the open air, but I had to sneak through the damned alleys and courtyards here. Luckily I'm a runner too."" Out of pride he gave Karl a sweeping slap on the back. ""It's good practice to run like this with the police from time to time."" ""I was tired when I started to run,"" said Karl. ""There's no excuse for bad walking,"" said Delamarche. ""If it wasn't for me, they would have caught you long ago."" ""I think so too,"" said Karl. ""I owe you a great deal."" ""No doubt,"" said Delamarche.","No sooner had he taken a couple of bounds down this street – already he had forgotten that his name had been called, because now the second policeman was blowing his whistle as well, you could sense he was new to the chase, and far-off pedestrians in the street seemed to walk at a brisker pace – than a hand came out of a little doorway and with the words ‘Keep shtum,’ pulled Karl into a dark passageway. It was Delamarche, quite out of breath, with flushed cheeks, and hair plastered to his head. He was carrying his dressing-gown under his arm, and was dressed only in shirt and underpants. The door, which wasn’t the front door of the house, but an unobtrusive side-entrance, he immediately shut and locked behind them. ‘ Just a second,’ he said, leaned his head back against the wall, and panted. Karl, virtually in his arms, and half insensate, pressed his face against his chest. ‘There they go,’ said Delamarche, and pointed to the door as he listened. And indeed the two policemen were running past, their footfall echoed in the empty street, ringing like steel on stone. ‘You’re all in, aren’t you,’ said Delamarche to Karl, who was still choking on his breath and unable to get a word out. Delamarche put him down carefully on the floor, knelt down beside him, stroked his brow a few times and watched. ‘ That’s better,’ said Karl at last, and struggled to his feet. ‘Let’s go then,’ said Delamarche, putting his dressing-gown on again, and pushing Karl, still too weak to raise his head, in front of him. From time to time he gave him a little shake to freshen him up. ‘How come you’re so tired?’ he said. ‘You were able to gallop about like a horse in the open, while I had to crawl through the goddamned yards and passages. Luckily I’m a good runner too.’ In his satisfaction he gave Karl a terrific thump on the back. ‘The occasional race against the police is good practice.’ ‘I was already tired when I started running,’ said Karl. ‘There’s no excuse for bad running,’ said Delamarche. ‘If it hadn’t been for me, they’d have nabbed you long ago.’ ‘I think so too,’ said Karl, ‘I’m very indebted to you.’ ‘No doubt about it,’ said Delamarche.","He had scarcely advanced two bounds—having once again forgotten that someone had called out his name; the second policeman had started whistling and one could sense his still untapped vigor; some distant passersby on this side street seemed to quicken their pace—when someone reached out from a little doorway to Karl and pulled him into a dark corridor with the words “Be careful.” It was Delamarche, quite out of breath, cheeks flushed, hair plastered down all over his head. Carrying his dressing gown under his arm, he was dressed only in shirt and underpants. Turning to the door, which happened not to be the main door but merely an inconspicuous side entrance, he shut and locked it. “Just a moment,” he said, and then straightening up his head, he leaned against the wall and took deep breaths. Now Karl nearly lay in his arms, pressing his face half-unconsciously up against Delamarche’s chest. “That’s the gentlemen running past,” said Delamarche, listening attentively and pointing toward the door. And the two policemen did run past; on the empty street their steps sounded like steel striking stone. “You’re really beat,” said Delamarche to Karl, who was still gasping for breath and could not speak. Delamarche set him down carefully on the ground, knelt beside him, patted his forehead several times, and observed him. “I’m fine now,” said Karl at last, and with effort got to his feet. “Then hurry up,” said Delamarche, who had put on his dressing gown and now seized Karl, whose head was still bowed out of weakness, and pushed him forward. Now and then he shook Karl to revive him. “You say you’re tired?” he said. “But you were able to run like a horse out in the open, whereas I had to crawl along those damned corridors and courtyards. But, fortunately, I’m a runner too.” In his pride he gave Karl an energetic slap on the back. “Having races with the police like that is such good exercise!” “I was already tired when I started running,” said Karl. “There’s no excuse for a bad run,” said Delamarche. “If it hadn’t been for me, they’d have caught you long ago.” “I can believe that,” said Karl. “And I’m very obliged to you.” “There’s no doubt about that,” said Delamarche."
"Die Straßen wurden jetzt zwar immer belebter, aber die Aufmerksamkeit, die der Wagen erregte, war nicht so groß wie Karl befürchtet hatte. Vielleicht wäre es über- haupt klüger gewesen, eine andere Zeit für den Trans- port zu wählen. Wenn eine solche Fahrt wieder nötig werden sollte, wollte sich Karl getrauen sie in der Mit- tagstunde auszuführen. Ohne schwerer belästigt worden zu sein, bog er endlich in die schmale dunkle Gasse ein, in der das Unternehmen Nr. 25 sich befand. Vor der Tür stand der schielende Verwalter mit der Uhr in der Hand. „Bist Du immer so unpünktlich?"" fragte er. „Es gab verschiedene Hindernisse"", sagte Karl. „Die gibt es be- kanntlich immer"", sagte der Verwalter. „Hier im Haus gelten sie aber nicht. Merk Dir das!"" Auf solche Reden hörte Karl kaum mehr hin, jeder nützte seine Macht aus und beschimpfe den Niedrigen. War man einmal daran gewöhnt, klang es nicht anders als das regelmäßige Uhrenschlagen. Wohl aber erschreckte ihn, als er jetzt den Wagen in den Flur schob, der Schmutz, der hier herrsch- te und den er allerdings erwartet hatte. Es war, wenn man näher zusah, kein faßbarer Schmutz. Der Steinbo- den des Flurs war fast rein gekehrt, die Malerei der Wän- de nicht alt, die künstlichen Palmen nur wenig verstaubt, und doch war alles fettig und abstoßend, es war, als wäre von allem ein schlechter Gebrauch gemacht worden und als wäre keine Reinlichkeit mehr imstande, das wieder gut zu machen. Karl dachte gern, wenn er irgendwohin kam, darüber nach, was hier verbessert werden könne und welche Freude es sein müßte, sofort einzugreifen, ohne Rücksicht auf die vielleicht endlose Arbeit die es verursachen würde. Hier aber wußte er nicht, was zu tun wäre. Langsam nahm er das Tuch von Brunelda ab. Willkommen Fräulein"", sagte der Verwalter geziert, es war kein Zweifel, daß Brunelda einen guten Eindruck auf ihn machte. Sobald Brunelda dies merkte, verstand sie das, wie Karl befriedigt sah, gleich auszunützen. Alle Angst der letzten Stunden verschwand. Sie","The streets were now getting busier, but the attention the car was attracting wasn't as great as Karl had feared. Perhaps it would have been wiser to choose a different time for the transport. If such a trip should become necessary again, Karl wanted to dare to do it in the midday hour. Without being bothered more severely, he finally turned into the narrow, dark alley where Company No. 25 was located. In front of the door stood the squinting manager with the watch in his hand. ""Are you always so unpunctual?"" he asked. ""There were various obstacles,"" said Karl. ""As you know, they always exist,"" said the manager. ""But they don't apply here in the house. Remember that!"" Karl hardly listened to such speeches, everyone used their power and insulted the lowly. Once you got used to it, it sounded no different than the regular clock chiming. However, as he now pushed the car into the hallway, he was frightened by the dirt that prevailed here and which he had certainly expected. If you looked closer, it wasn't dirt that you could grasp. The stone floor of the hallway was almost swept clean, the painting on the walls not old, the artificial palm trees only a little dusty, and yet everything was greasy and repulsive, it was as if everything had been badly used and as if no more cleanliness can make up for it. Whenever he went somewhere, Karl liked to think about what could be improved here and what a pleasure it would be to intervene immediately, regardless of the perhaps endless work it would cause. But here he didn't know what to do. Slowly he took the cloth from Brunelda. ""Welcome Miss,"" said the manager primly, there was no doubt that Brunelda made a good impression on him. As soon as Brunelda noticed this, she knew how to take advantage of it, as Karl saw with satisfaction. All the fear of the last few hours disappeared. She","The streets were now getting more and more populous, but the wagon aroused rather less attention than Karl had feared. Perhaps it might even have been wiser to choose a different time for the move. If another journey like this should become necessary, Karl decided to try it at noon. Without any further serious incident, he finally turned into the dark narrow alleyway where Enterprise No. 25 was. In front of the door stood the squinting administrator with his watch in his hand. ‘ Are you always this late?’ he asked. ‘We had various obstacles,’ explained Karl. ‘You always get those,’ said the administrator. ‘In this firm, they’re not an excuse. Kindly remember that!’ Karl barely listened to talk like that any more, everyone used their own power and belaboured the next man. Once you’d gotten used to it, it wasn’t really much more than the regular striking of a clock. But what did alarm him as he pulled the wagon into the corridor was the dirt there, although he’d been expecting it too. It wasn’t, when he looked at it more closely, any tangible sort of dirt. The stone flags in the passage had been swept almost clean, the whitewash on the walls wasn’t old, the artificial palms only slightly dusty, and yet everything was greasy and repulsive, it was as though everything had been somehow misused, and no cleaning on earth could ever make it better. Whenever Karl came to a new place, he liked to think what improvements could be made to it, and how pleasant it must be to roll up his sleeves and get down to it, regardless of the almost infinite labour it would take. But here he didn’t know where to start. Slowly he took the cloth off Brunelda. ‘Welcome, Miss,’ said the administrator affectedly, there was no question that Brunelda had made a good impression on him. No sooner had Brunelda sensed that than, as Karl observed with satisfaction, she began to exploit it. The fear of the last few hours vanished. She [text ends here]","Though the streets were becoming increasingly animated, the cart did not attract as much attention as Karl had feared. It might even have been wiser to pick another time for this move. Should another such journey become necessary, Karl would risk setting off at noon. Without encountering any worse annoyance, he turned into the dark narrow street where Enterprise No. 25 was located. The manager stood by the door, holding his watch, and squinting. “Are you always so unpunctual?” he asked. “There were obstacles of various kinds,” said Karl. “Naturally, there always are,” said the manager. “But here in this building we make no allowance for them. Mark my words!” Karl barely heeded such speeches; everyone took advantage of his power and yelled at his underlings. But once you became used to that, it sounded no different than the regular ticking of a clock. But what did startle him as he pushed his cart along the corridor was the dirt lying everywhere, though he had admittedly expected something of the sort. However, on closer scrutiny, the dirt was inexplicable. The stone floor in the corridor had been swept almost clean, the paint on the walls was relatively new, not much dust had collected on the artificial palms, but everything was greasy and repulsive; it was as if everything had been subjected to such abuse that no amount of cleaning could remedy it. Whenever Karl arrived somewhere, he liked to think about the improvements that could be made and how pleasant it would be to get started right away, however endless the work required. But in this case he did not know what could be done. Slowly he removed the cloth from Brunelda. “Welcome, miss,” the manager said in an affected manner; there could be no doubt that Brunelda made a favorable impression on him. Brunelda had no sooner noticed this than she turned it to her advantage, as Karl noticed with satisfaction. All the fear of those last hours disappeared. She"
"Die Frage ob er stellungslos gewesen sei, beantwortete er mit einem einfachen „Ja"". „Wo waren Sie zuletzt angestellt?"" fragte dann der Herr. Karl wollte schon ant- worten, da hob der Herr den Zeigefinger und sagte noch einmal: „Zuletzt!"" Karl hatte auch schon die erste Frage richtig verstanden, unwillkürlich schüttelte er die letzte Bemerkung als beirrend mit dem Kopfe ab und antwor- tete: „In einem Bureau."" Das war noch die Wahrheit, würde aber der Herr eine nähere Auskunf über die Art des Bureaus verlangen, so mußte er lügen. Aber das tat der Herr nicht, sondern stellte die überaus leicht ganz wahrheitsgemäß zu beantwortende Frage: „Waren Sie dort zufrieden?"" „Nein"", rief Karl ihm fast in die Rede fallend. Bei einem Seitenblick bemerkte Karl, daß der Führer ein wenig lächelte, Karl bereute die unbedachte Art seiner letzten Antwort, aber es war zu verlockend gewesen, das Nein hinauszuschrein, denn während sei- ner ganzen letzten Dienstzeit hatte er nur den großen Wunsch gehabt, irgendein fremder Dienstgeber möge einmal eintreten und diese Frage an ihn richten. Seine Antwort konnte aber noch einen andern Nachteil brin- gen, denn der Herr konnte nun fragen, warum er nicht zufrieden gewesen sei. Statt dessen fragte er jedoch: „Zu was für einem Posten fühlen Sie sich geeignet?"" Diese Frage enthielt möglicherweise wirklich eine Falle, denn wozu wurde sie gestellt, da Karl doch schon als Schau- spieler aufgenommen war; trotzdem er das aber erkann- te, konnte er sich dennoch nicht zu der Erklärung über- winden, er fühle sich für den Schauspielerberuf beson- ders geeignet. Er wich daher der Frage aus und sagte auf die Gefahr hin trotzig zu erscheinen: „Ich habe das Pla- kat in der Stadt gelesen und da dort stand, daß man jeden brauchen kann, habe ich mich gemeldet."" „Das wissen wir"", sagte der Herr, schwieg und zeigte dadurch daß er auf seiner frühern Frage beharre. „Ich bin als Schauspie- ler aufgenommen"", sagte Karl zögernd, um den Herren die Schwierigkeit, in die ihn die letzte Frage gebracht hatte, begreiflich zu machen. „Das ist richtig"", sagte der Herr und verstummte wieder. „Nun"", sagte Karl und die ganze Hoffnung einen Posten gefunden zu haben, kam ins Wanken, „ich weiß nicht, ob ich zum Teater- spielen geeignet bin. Ich will mich aber anstrengen und alle Aufräge auszuführen suchen."" Der Herr wandte sich dem Leiter zu, beide nickten, Karl schien richtig geantwortet zu haben, er faßte wieder Mut und erwarte- te aufgerichtet die nächste Frage. Die lautete: „Was wollten Sie denn ursprünglich studieren?"" Um die Frage genau zu bestimmen – an der genauen Bestimmung lag dem Herrn immer sehr viel – fügte er hinzu: „In Euro- pa, meine ich."" Hiebei nahm er die Hand vom Kinn und machte eine schwache Bewegung, als wolle er damit gleichzeitig andeuten wie ferne Europa und wie bedeu- tungslos die dort einmal gefaßten Pläne seien. Karl sagte: Ich wollte Ingenieur werden."" Diese Antwort wider- strebte ihm zwar, es war lächerlich im vollen Bewußt- sein seiner bisherigen Laufahn in Amerika die alte Erinnerung, daß er einmal habe Ingenieur werden wol- len, hier wieder aufzufrischen – wäre er es denn selbst in Europa jemals geworden? – aber er wußte gerade keine andere Antwort und sagte deshalb diese. Aber der Herr nahm es ernst, wie er alles ernst nahm. „Nun Inge- nieur"", sagte er, „können Sie wohl nicht gleich werden, vielleicht würde es Ihnen aber vorläufig entsprechen, ir- gendwelche niedrige technische Arbeiten auszuführen."" Gewiß"", sagte Karl, er war sehr zufrieden, er wurde zwar, wenn er das Angebot annahm, aus dem Schauspie- lerstand unter die technischen Arbeiter geschoben, aber er glaubte tatsächlich sich bei dieser Arbeit besser be- währen zu können. Übrigens, dies wiederholte er sich immer wieder, es kam nicht so sehr auf die Art der Arbeit an, als vielmehr darauf sich überhaupt irgendwo dauernd festzuhalten. „Sind Sie denn kräfig genug für schwerere Arbeit?"" fragte der Herr. „Oja"", sagte Karl. Hierauf ließ der Herr Karl näher zu sich herankommen und befühlte seinen Arm. „Es ist ein kräfiger Junge"" sagte er dann, indem er Karl am Arm zum Führer hin- zog. Der Führer nickte lächelnd, reichte ohne sich übri- gens aus seiner Ruhelage aufzurichten Karl die Hand und sagte: „Dann sind wir also fertig. In Oklahama wird alles noch überprüf werden. Machen Sie unserer Werbe- truppe Ehre!"" Karl verbeugte sich zum Abschied, er wollte sich dann auch von dem andern Herren verab- schieden, dieser aber spazierte schon, als sei er mit seiner Arbeit vollständig fertig, das Gesicht in die Höhe gerich- tet auf der Platform auf und ab. Während Karl hinunter- stieg wurde zur Seite der Treppe auf der Anzeigetafel die Aufschrif hochgezogen: „Negro, technischer Arbei- ter"". Da alles hier seinen ordentlichen Gang nahm, hätte es Karl nicht mehr so sehr bedauert, wenn auf der Tafel sein wirklicher Name zu lesen gewesen wäre. Es war alles sogar überaus sorgfältig eingerichtet, denn am Fuß der Treppe wurde Karl schon von einem Diener erwar- tet, der ihm eine Binde um den Arm festmachte. Als Karl dann den Arm hob, um zu sehn was auf der Binde stand, war dort der ganz richtige Aufdruck „technischer Arbeiter"".","When asked whether he had been unemployed, he answered with a simple ""Yes"". ""Where were you last employed?"" then asked the gentleman. Karl was about to answer when the gentleman raised his index finger and said again: ""Finally!"" Karl had already understood the first question correctly, involuntarily he shook his head off the last remark as confusing and answered: "" In an office."" That was still the truth, but if the gentleman asked for more detailed information about the nature of the office, he would have to lie. But the gentleman didn't do that, but asked the question, which could be answered very easily and truthfully: ""Were you satisfied there?"" ""No,"" Karl called out, almost interrupting his speech. Looking sideways, Karl noticed that the Führer smiled a little, Karl regretted the thoughtless manner of his last answer, but it had been too tempting to shout out the no, because during his entire last period of service he had had only one great wish, some one foreign employer may step in and address this question to him. But his answer could have another disadvantage, because the Lord could now ask why he wasn't satisfied. Instead, however, he asked: ""What kind of post do you feel suitable for?"" This question may actually contain a trap, for why was it asked, since Karl had already been accepted as an actor, although he recognized it , he couldn't bring himself to declare that he felt particularly suited to the acting profession, so he dodged the question and said at the risk of appearing defiant: “I've got the poster in town I read it and since it said that you can use anyone, I got in touch."" ""We know that,"" said the gentleman, who remained silent, thereby showing that he was sticking to his earlier question. ""I've been accepted as an actor,"" said Karl hesitantly, for the sake of the gentlemen's trouble into which the last question had gotten him , to make it understandable. ""That's right,"" said the gentleman and fell silent again. ""Well,"" said Karl and all hope of having found a job faltered, ""I don't know if I'm suitable for acting. But I want to make an effort and try to carry out all the orders."" The gentleman turned to the manager, both nodded, Karl seemed to have answered correctly, he regained courage and waited upright for the next question. It read: ""What did you want because originally studying?"" In order to define the question precisely - the gentleman was always very keen on the exact definition - he added: ""In Europe, I mean."" At this he took his hand from his chin and made a weak movement as if he wanted to do it at the same time indicate how far away Europe is and how meaningless the plans made there are. Karl said: I wanted to be an engineer."" He was reluctant to answer this, it was ridiculous to refresh the old memory that he once wanted to be an engineer here, fully aware of his previous career in America – would he ever have become one in Europe? - but he just didn't know any other answer and therefore said this one. But the Lord took it seriously as He took everything seriously. ""Well, you can't become an engineer right away,"" he said, ""but perhaps doing some low-level technical work would suit you for the time being."" Certainly,"" said Karl, he was very satisfied, if he accepted the offer he would indeed be pushed down from the acting rank to the position of the technical workers, but he really believed he could prove himself better in this work. By the way, this he repeated over and over again, it wasn't so much the kind of work as whether you were holding on to something all the time. ""Are you strong enough for heavier work?"" asked the gentleman. ""Oh yes,"" said Karl. The gentleman then let Karl come closer and felt his arm. ""He's a strong boy,"" he then said, pulling Karl's arm towards the guide. The guide nodded with a smile, gave Karl his hand without actually getting up from his resting position and said: ""Then we're done. Everything will be checked in Oklahama. Do our recruiting team credit!” Karl bowed in farewell, he then wanted to say goodbye to the other gentleman, but he was already walking as if he had completely finished his work, his face lifted up and down the platform. As Karl descended, the inscription on the side of the stairs was pulled up on the display board: ""Negro, technical worker"". Since everything was going according to plan here, Karl wouldn't have regretted it so much if his real name had been on the blackboard. In fact, everything was set up very carefully, because a servant was already waiting for Karl at the foot of the stairs, and he tied a bandage around his arm. When Karl then raised his arm to see what was written on the napkin, there was the correct imprint ""technical worker"".","The question whether he had been out of work, he answered with a straightforward ‘Yes.’ ‘Where were you last employed?’ the gentleman then asked. Karl was about to reply, when he lifted his finger and said: ‘I stress: last!’ Karl had understood the original question anyway, and now involuntarily shook his head at this confusing remark, and replied: ‘In an office.’ This was indeed the case, but if the gentleman happened to want to know a little more about the type of office, he would be forced to lie to him. But the gentleman did not do that, and instead asked a question which was very easy to answer truthfully: ‘Were you happy there?’ ‘No,’ cried Karl, almost before he had finished. Looking out of the corner of his eye, Karl noticed that the leader was smiling a little, Karl regretted the impulsiveness of his last reply, but it had been too tempting to shout out that ‘No,’ because during the whole of his last employment, he had been simply longing for some new employer to come along and ask him precisely that question. But his answer could have another drawback too, because the gentleman could now go on to ask him why he hadn’t been happy. Instead, though, he asked: ‘What sort of job do you think would suit you?’ That might be a trick question, because why was it being asked, if Karl had already been taken on as an actor: although he saw that, he still couldn’t bring himself to claim that he felt particularly suited for the profession of acting. And so he avoided the question, and, at the risk of seeming obstinate, he said: ‘I read the poster in the city, and as it said that all were welcome, I came along.’ ‘We know that,’ said the gentleman, and his ensuing silence indicated that he insisted on an answer to his question. ‘I was taken on as an actor,’ Karl said hesitantly, to make it clear to the gentleman how difficult he found this last question. ‘ That’s right,’ said the gentleman, and was once more silent. ‘ Well,’ said Karl, and all his hopes of having found a job began to shake, ‘I don’t know if I’m right for acting. But I will do my best, and try to do everything I’m asked.’ The gentleman turned to the leader, and they both nodded, Karl seemed to have given a good answer, he plucked up courage again, and awaited the next question, a little more hopefully. That was: ‘What were you originally going to study?’ To narrow the question down – the gentleman seemed at pains to do that – he added: ‘I mean, in Europe.’ At the same time, he took his hand away from his chin, and waved it feebly, as though to indicate at one and the same time the remoteness of Europe and the insignificance of whatever plans might have been made there. Karl said: ‘I wanted to be an engineer.’ The answer went against the grain, it was absurd in the context of his career so far in America to bring out that old chestnut – and would he ever have succeeded, even in Europe? – but it was the only answer he had and for that reason he gave it. The gentleman, though, took it seriously, as he took everything seriously. ‘ Well,’ he said, ‘we probably can’t make an engineer out of you right away, but maybe it would suit you for the time being to work on some fairly simple technical tasks.’ ‘Certainly,’ said Karl, he was very happy, of course if he accepted the offer it would mean being plucked out of the acting profession, and put with the technical workers, but he really believed he would make a much better fist of that. Anyway, he kept saying to himself, what mattered wasn’t so much the type of work as one’s ability to stick it out, whatever it might be. ‘Are you strong enough for such demanding work?’ asked the gentleman. ‘ Oh yes,’ said Karl. Thereupon the gentleman had Karl come up to him, and felt his arm. ‘ He’s a strong lad,’ he said, pulling Karl by the arm over to the leader. The leader nodded and smiled, then without getting off the railing, he gave Karl his hand and said: ‘ Well, that’s it then. In Oklahoma, we’ll check everything over again. Be sure to be a credit to our publicity team!’ Karl gave a final bow, and he wanted to take leave of the other gentleman too, but he was already walking up and down the platform, looking up, as though completely finished with his task. As Karl climbed down the stairs, next to him the scoreboard was pulled up, and on it the words: ‘Negro, Technical Worker’. As everything had gone so well, Karl wouldn’t have minded too much if it had been his real name up on the board. Everything was very well organized, because at the foot of the stairs, Karl was met by a servant who put an armband round his arm. When Karl lifted his arm to see what was on the band, it was, quite rightly, ‘technical worker’.","To the question whether he had been unemployed he simply responded, “Yes.” “Where were you employed last?” the gentleman insisted. Karl was about to answer when the gentle man raised his index finger and repeated: “Employed last!” Karl had understood the question correctly the first time; brushing off that last remark with an involuntary movement of his head, he answered: “In an office.” This was certainly true, but if the gentleman had gone on to ask what kind of office it was, he would have had to lie. But rather than doing so, the gentleman asked a question that could easily be answered truthfully: “Were you satisfied there?” “No,” Karl cried, almost cutting him off. Karl noticed through a side glance that the leader was smiling slightly; Karl regretted having answered so heedlessly, but it had simply been too tempting to shout “No,” for throughout his last period in service his sole wish had been that some unknown employer would walk in and ask that very question. Besides, that answer could also put him at a disadvantage since the gentleman could now ask why he hadn’t been satisfied. But instead the gentleman merely asked: “For what kind of job do you think you are suited?” This question could be a trap, for why did he ask, since Karl had already been taken on as an actor; he could not bring himself to explain that he did not feel especially suited to the theatrical profession, though he realized full well he was not. He therefore evaded the question and, at the risk of appearing defiant, said: “I saw the poster in the city and signed up because it stated that you could make use of everybody.” “That we already know,” the gentleman said, falling silent and thereby underscoring his insistence on obtaining an answer to his previous question. “I’ve been taken on as an actor,” said Karl, in a hesitant voice so that the gentleman might understand the difficult situation the last question had created for him. “Well,” said Karl—and all his hopes of having found a position began to fade—“I don’t know if I’m suited to acting. But I’ll certainly try very hard to carry out each and every assignment.” The gentleman turned to the manager, and both nodded; Karl appeared to have given the right answer; summoning his courage again, he straightened up and waited for the next question: “What did you want to study first?” In an effort to come up with a more precise formulation—this gentleman was always adamant about formulating everything precisely—he added: “In Europe, I mean.” As he spoke, he removed his hand from his chin and waved it about feebly as if wishing to signal the remoteness of Europe and the insignificance of any plans that might have been made there. Karl said: “I wanted to become an engineer.” It wasn’t easy to say so, for he was acutely aware of his track record in America and realized how ridiculous it was to dredge up that old memory of having once wanted to become an engineer—would he have ever really become one, even in Europe?—but since that was the only answer he could come up with, it was the one he gave. But the gentleman took this seriously, as seriously as he took everything else. “Well,” he said, “you probably can’t become an engineer right away, but the most appropriate course for you right now would be to take on some simple work as a technician.” “Certainly,” said Karl, who was quite satisfied; if he accepted this offer, it would of course mean that he’d be taken out of the actors’ group and put in with the technicians, but he believed that being in such a position would really allow him to prove his worth. Besides, he kept repeating to himself, what mattered was not so much the kind of work he did as finding a lasting foothold somewhere. “But are you strong enough for the more strenuous kind of work?” the gentleman asked. “Oh yes,” said Karl. Whereupon the gentleman asked Karl to come closer and felt his arm. “He’s a strong lad,” he said, taking Karl’s arm and drawing him toward the leader. Smiling, the leader nodded, held out his hand to Karl, and without standing up, said: “Then we’re all set. Everything will be checked again in Oklahama. Bring honor to our recruiting troupe!” Karl bowed in farewell; he wanted to say goodbye to the other gentleman, but as if his work were already completed, the latter was already walking up and down the platform with his head raised. As Karl descended the stairs, a sign was hoisted on the signboard near the steps: “Negro, technician.” Since everything was falling into place so easily, Karl would have had few regrets if his real name had appeared on the signboard. Everything had been so carefully arranged, for already awaiting him at the foot of the steps was a servant who fastened a band around his arm. And when Karl lifted his arm to see the words written on the band, he saw that the inscription was completely accurate: “technician.”"
"Den Eßtisch fand er an einer offenbar ganz anderen Stelle wie am Abend, das Kanapee, dem sich Karl natür- lich sehr vorsichtig näherte, war überraschenderweise leer, dagegen stieß er in der Zimmermitte auf hochge- schichtete, wenn auch stark gepreßte Kleider, Decken, Vorhänge, Polster und Teppiche. Zuerst dachte er, es sei nur ein kleiner Haufen, ähnlich dem, den er am Abend auf dem Sofa gefunden hatte und der etwa auf die Erde gerollt war, aber zu seinem Staunen bemerkte er beim Weiterkriechen, daß da eine ganze Wagenladung solcher Sachen lag, die man wahrscheinlich für die Nacht aus den Kästen herausgenommen hatte, wo sie während des Tages aufewahrt wurden. Er umkroch den Haufen und erkannte bald, daß das Ganze eine Art Bettlager darstell- te, auf dem hoch oben, wie er sich durch vorsichtigstes Tasten überzeugte, Delamarche und Brunelda ruhten.","He found the dining table in an obviously completely different place than in the evening, the settee, which Karl naturally approached very carefully, was surprisingly empty, but in the middle of the room he came across piles of, albeit heavily pressed, clothes, blankets, Curtains, upholstery and carpets. At first he thought it was just a small pile, like the one he had found on the sofa that evening, which had about rolled onto the ground, but to his amazement, as he crawled along, he noticed that there was a whole truckload of such things, which had probably been taken out of the boxes for the night, where they were kept during the day. He crawled around the heap and soon realized that the whole thing represented a kind of cot on which, by the most careful touch, he was convinced Delamarche and Brunelda were resting high up.","The dining-table was obviously somewhere completely different from where it had been in the evening, the sofa, which Karl of course approached with extreme caution was surprisingly enough unoccupied, but instead, in the middle of the room he encountered a high pile of albeit crushed clothes, blankets, curtains, pillows and rugs. To begin with he thought it was just a little pile like the one he had found on the sofa in the evening, and that had maybe rolled down on to the floor, but to his amazement, as he crept on, he realized it was a whole cartload of such stuff that had probably been taken out of the boxes for the night, where it was kept in the daytime. He crawled round the pile and soon recognized that the whole thing was a kind of bed, high on top of which, as his most cautious probing told him, Delamarche and Brunelda were resting.","The dining room table was evidently in a different position than the night before, and the settee, which Karl naturally approached with great caution, was surprisingly empty; but in the middle of the room he came across piled-up but tightly compressed clothes, blankets, curtains, cushions, and carpets.

He crawled around the heap and soon saw that the whole thing was actually a kind of bed, at the summit of which, as he assured himself through careful groping, Delamarche and Brunelda were resting."

"„Schau nach, Delamarche"", sagte da Brunelda, „ich glaube, sie zerwerfen unser Bett. An alles muß man den- ken, niemals hat man Ruhe. Du mußt gegen die zwei strenger sein, sie machen sonst, was sie wollen."" „Das ist gewiß der Kleine mit seinem verdammten Diensteifer"", rief Delamarche und wollte wahrscheinlich aus dem Waschraum hervorstürzen, Karl warf schon alles aus der Hand, aber glücklicherweise sagte Brunelda: „Nicht weggehn Delamarche, nicht weggehn. Ach, wie ist das Wasser heiß, man wird so müde. Bleib bei mir Dela- marche."" Erst jetzt merkte Karl eigentlich, wie der Was- serdampf hinter den Kästen unauförlich emporstieg.","""Look, Delamarche,"" said da Brunelda, ""I think they're throwing our bed upside down. You have to think of everything, you never get any rest. You have to be stricter on the two of them, otherwise they'll do what they want."" ""It must be the little one with his damned eagerness to serve,"" cried Delamarche and probably wanted to rush out of the washroom. Karl was already throwing everything out of his hands, but fortunately Brunelda said: ""Don't go away, Delamarche, don't go away. Oh, how hot the water is ""One gets so tired. Stay with me, Delamarche."" Only now did Karl actually notice how the steam was constantly rising behind the boxes.","‘Do go and see what’s happening, Delamarche,’ said Brunelda, ‘I think they’re attacking our bed. You need to be on your guard the whole time, there’s never a moment’s peace. You’ll have to be stricter with those two, or they’ll just do as they please.’ ‘It’s bound to be the little fellow with his bloody industriousness,’ said Delamarche, and it sounded as though he was about to erupt out of the washroom, Karl hurriedly dropped everything, but fortunately Brunelda said: ‘Don’t leave me, Delamarche, don’t leave me. Oh, the water’s so hot, it’s making me so tired. Stay here with me, Delamarche.’ Only then did Karl really notice how there were swathes of steam rising incessantly behind the dressers.","“Take a look next door, Delamarche,” said Brunelda, “I think they’re pulling our bed apart. I always have to think of everything and never have a moment’s peace. You must be stricter with those two, for if not they’ll simply do as they please.” “That must be the little fellow who’s so damned eager,” cried Delamarche, evidently intending to rush out from the washroom; Karl immediately threw away everything he had in his hands; fortunately, Brunelda then said: “Don’t go, Delamarche, don’t go. Oh, the water is hot, it makes one so weary. Stay with me, Delamarche.” Only then did Karl notice the steam continually rising from behind the closets."
"„Gehen Sie also vorerst"", fuhr Herr Green fort, „zu Fräulein Klara. Das dürfe Ihnen sicher Vergnügen ma- chen und paßt auch sehr gut in meine Zeiteinteilung. Ich habe Ihnen nämlich tatsächlich ehe Sie von hier fortgehn etwas Interessantes zu sagen, was wahrscheinlich auch für Ihre Rückkehr entscheidend sein kann. Nur bin ich leider durch höheren Befehl gebunden, Ihnen vor Mit- ternacht nichts zu verraten. Sie können sich vorstellen, daß mir das selbst leid tut, denn es stört meine Nacht- ruhe, aber ich halte mich an meinen Aufrag. Jetzt ist viertel zwölf, ich kann also meine Geschäfe noch mit Herrn Pollunder zu Ende besprechen, wobei Ihre Ge- genwart nur stören würde und Sie können ein hübsches Weilchen mit Fräulein Klara verbringen. Punkt zwölf Uhr stellen Sie sich dann hier ein, wo Sie das Nötige erfahren werden.""","""So go first,"" continued Mr. Green, ""to Miss Klara. That should certainly give you pleasure and also fits in very well with my schedule. I actually have something interesting to say to you before you leave here, what probably also decisive for your return. Unfortunately, I'm bound by higher orders not to tell you anything before midnight. You can imagine that I'm sorry myself, because it disturbs my night's sleep, but I'm holding I'll get to my assignment. It's eleven fifteen, so I can finish my business with Mr. Pollunder, although your presence would only be a nuisance, and you can spend a nice little while with Fraulein Klara. Then come here at twelve o'clock sharp where you will learn what you need.""","‘So first you go and look in on Miss Klara,’ continued Mr Green. ‘That ought to be a pleasure for you, and it also fits in nicely with my own timetable. Because it so happens I have something interesting to tell you before you leave here, which may well affect your decision to return home. Only unfortunately I’m bound by a higher command not to reveal anything to you before midnight. You can imagine how I regret that, because it eats into my nighe’s sleep, but I must stick to my instructions. The time now is a quarter past eleven, therefore I can finish discussing my business with Mr Pollunder, where you would only be in the way, while you can spend an agreeable few minutes with Miss Klara. On the dot of twelve you present yourself back here, where you will be told all that is needful for you.’","“Well then,” Mr. Green continued, “you may go to Miss Klara for the time being. That will surely give you pleasure and also fits in nicely with my schedule. For before you leave I have something interesting to tell you that might indeed affect your return. Unfortunately, I cannot disclose anything to you before midnight, on orders from above. As you can imagine, I too find this most regrettable since it’s disrupting my night ’s sleep, but I will carry out my task. It’s now a quarter past eleven, so I still have time to finish my business with Mr. Pollunder, and since your presence would be disruptive, you can go and have a nice time with Miss Klara. Show up here at twelve o’clock sharp, and you’ll find out what you need to know.”"
"„Haben Sie noch einen weiten Marsch?"" fragte die Frau. „Bis nach Butterford"", antwortete Karl. „Das ist noch sehr weit"", sagte die Frau. „Noch eine Tagereise"", sagte Karl. „Nicht weiter?"" fragte die Frau. „Oh nein"", sagte Karl.","""Do you still have a long way to go?"" asked the woman. ""To Butterford,"" answered Karl. ""That's still a long way off,"" said the woman. ""One more day's journey,"" said Karl. ""No further?"" asked the woman. ""Oh no,"" said Karl.","‘Have you got far to go?’ asked the woman. ‘ To Butterford,’ replied Karl. ‘That’s a very long way,’ said the woman. ‘ Another day’s walk,’ said Karl. ‘ No more?’ asked the woman. ‘ Oh no,’ said Karl.","“Do you still have a long march ahead of you?” asked the woman. “To Butterford,” Karl answered. “That’s still quite far,” the woman said. “Another day’s worth,” said Karl. “That’s all?” the woman asked. “Oh, no,” said Karl."
"Das Geländer war übrigens nicht lang und bald wurde Karl wieder vom geschlossenen Gang aufgenommen. Bei einer plötzlichen Wendung des Ganges stieß Karl mit ganzer Wucht an die Mauer und nur die ununterbroche- ne Sorgfalt mit der er die Kerze krampfaf hielt, be- wahrte sie glücklicherweise vor dem Fallen und Auslö- schen. Da der Gang kein Ende nehmen wollte, nirgends ein Fenster einen Ausblick gab, weder in der Höhe noch in der Tiefe sich etwas rührte, dachte Karl schon daran, er gehe immerfort im gleichen Kreisgang in der Runde und hofe schon, die offene Türe seines Zimmers viel- leicht wieder zu finden, aber weder sie noch das Gelän- der kehrte wieder. Bis jetzt hatte sich Karl von lautem Rufen zurückgehalten, denn er wollte in einem fremden Haus zu so später Stunde keinen Lärm machen, aber jetzt sah er ein, daß es in diesem unbeleuchteten Hause kein Unrecht war und machte sich gerade daran, nach beiden Seiten des Ganges ein lautes Halloh zu schreien, als er in der Richtung aus der er gekommen war, ein kleines sich näherndes Licht bemerkte. Jetzt konnte er erst die Länge des geraden Ganges abschätzen, das Haus war eine Festung, keine Villa. Karls Freude über dieses rettende Licht war so groß, daß er alle Vorsicht vergaß, und darauf zulief, schon bei den ersten Sprüngen löschte seine Kerze aus. Er achtete nicht darauf, denn er brauch- te sie nicht mehr, hier kam ihm ein alter Diener mit einer Laterne entgegen, der ihm den richtigen Weg schon zei- gen würde.","By the way, the railing wasn't long and soon Karl was picked up again from the closed corridor. When the corridor suddenly turned, Karl hit the wall with all his might and only the uninterrupted care with which he held the candle convulsively saved it from falling and going out. Since the corridor seemed to go on forever, there was no window anywhere, and nothing stirred either upstairs or downstairs, Karl was already thinking about going round and round in the same circle and hoping for the open door of his room maybe to be found again, but neither she nor the railing returned. Up until now Karl had held back from shouting loudly, because he didn't want to make any noise in a strange house at such a late hour, but now he saw that it wasn't wrong in this unlit house and set to work on both sides of the Ganges shouted a loud hello when he noticed a small light approaching in the direction he had come from. Only now could he estimate the length of the straight passage, the house was a fortress, not a villa. Karl's joy at this saving light was so great that he forgot all caution and ran towards it, and his candle went out as soon as he made the first jumps. He didn't pay attention because he didn't need it anymore, here an old servant with a lantern came towards him, who would show him the right way.","The balustrade did not go on for very long, and soon Karl was swallowed up by the enclosed corridor again. Suddenly it made a sharp turn, and Karl walked smack into a wall, only the vigilance with which he held the candle upright kept it from falling from his grasp and being extinguished. As the corridor seemed never ending, without a window anywhere and no sign of movement either high or low, it occurred to Karl that he was going round in a circle, he hoped to come upon the open door of his room soon, but neither that nor the balustrade returned. So far Karl had refrained from calling out, as he was reluctant to make a noise in a strange house at this late hour, but he now realized that it would be a forgivable thing to do in this unlit house, and he was just about to halloo loudly down the corridor in both directions, when he saw, from where he had come, a small light coming ever nearer. Karl’s joy at this salvation was so great that he forgot all his caution and started running towards it, which caused his candle to go out after a few steps. He didn’t care, he didn’t need it any more, here came an old retainer with a lantern who would show him the way.","Besides, the balustrade did not go on for long, and Karl soon found himself enveloped by the enclosed corridor again. At a sudden bend in the corridor Karl banged into the wall with his full weight, and only by clutching the candle with unflagging concentration did he fortunately prevent it from falling and becoming extinguished. Since this corridor would not end, and there was no window anywhere through which he could take a look, nor any sign of life above or below, Karl was beginning to think he had been going in a circle the entire time, and he even hoped he might come upon the open door to his room, but neither it nor the balustrade came around again. Hitherto Karl had refrained from shouting out loud, for at such a late hour he did not want to make any noise in this unfamiliar house, but he now realized that the noise wouldn’t do any harm in this unlit house and he was about to send a loud hello echoing up and down the corridor when he noticed a small light approaching, actually from the direction he had come from himself. But now he could at last gauge the length of this straight corridor; the house was not so much a villa as a fortress. Such was Karl’s joy on noticing this saving light that he abandoned all caution and ran toward it; after a few strides his candle went out. He ignored this, for he no longer needed the candle, and the old servant who was approaching with the lantern would, of course, show him the right way."
"„Roßmann warum kommen Sie denn nicht? Warum lassen Sie mich warten? Was haben Sie denn bei Fräulein Klara getrieben?"" „Viele Fragen!"" dachte Karl, „und jetzt drückt er mich noch an die Wand"", denn tatsäch- lich stand er dicht vor Karl, der mit dem Rücken an der Wand lehnte. Green nahm in diesem Gang eine schon lächerliche Größe an und Karl stellte sich zum Spaß die Frage, ob er nicht etwa den guten Herrn Pollunder auf- gefressen habe.","""Roßmann, why don't you come? Why are you making me wait? What were you doing with Fraulein Klara?"" ""Lots of questions!"" thought Karl, ""and now he's still pushing me against the wall"", because in fact he was standing right in front of Karl, who was leaning with his back against the wall. Green assumed a ridiculous size in this corridor and Karl stood up for fun the question as to whether he hadn't eaten up good Mr. Pollunder.","‘Rossmann, why aren’t you coming? Why are you keeping me waiting? What have you been up to with Miss Klara?’ ‘Questions, questions!’ thought Karl, and now he’ll push me against the wall, because he was standing right in front of Karl, whose back was indeed against the wall. In this corridor Green took on a quite ridiculous size, and Karl was even wondering flippantly to himself whether he might not have eaten up nice Mr Pollunder.","“Rossmann, what took you so long? Why have you kept me waiting? And what were you up to at Miss Klara’s?” He’s asking so many questions! thought Karl. And now he’s even pushing me up against the wall, for he now stood right before Karl, who leaned his back against the wall. In this corridor Green took on ridiculously large proportions, and Karl jokingly asked himself whether Green might not have gobbled up good old Mr. Pollunder."
"„Nun hat diese Brummer"", setzte der Onkel fort, von meinem Neffen ein Kind bekommen, einen gesun- den Jungen, welcher in der Taufe den Namen Jakob erhielt, zweifellos in Gedanken an meine Wenigkeit, welche selbst in den sicher nur ganz nebensächlichen Erwähnungen meines Neffen auf das Mädchen einen großen Eindruck gemacht haben muß. Glücklicherwei- se, sage ich. Denn da die Eltern zur Vermeidung der Ahmentenzahlung oder sonstigen bis an sie selbst heran- reichenden Skandales – ich kenne wie ich betonen muß, weder die dortigen Gesetze noch die sonstigen Verhält- nisse der Eltern, sondern weiß nur von zwei Bettelbrie- fen der Eltern aus früherer Zeit, die ich zwar unbeant- wortet gelassen aber aufgehoben habe und welche meine einzige und überdies einseitige briefliche Verbindung mit ihnen in der ganzen Zeit bedeuten – da also die Eltern zur Vermeidung der Alimentenzahlung und des Skandales ihren Sohn meinen lieben Neffen nach Ameri- ka haben transportieren lassen, mit unverantwortlich un- genügender Ausrüstung, wie man sieht – wäre der Jun- ge, wenn man von den gerade noch in Amerika lebendi- gen Zeichen und Wundern absieht, auf sich allein ange- wiesen, wohl schon gleich in einem Gäßchen im Hafen von Newyork verkommen, wenn nicht jenes Dienst- mädchen in einem an mich gerichteten Brief, der nach langen Irrfahrten vorgestern in meinen Besitz kam, mir die ganze Geschichte, samt Personenbeschreibung mei- nes Neffen und vernünfigerweise auch Namensnen- nung des Schiffes mitgeteilt hätte. Wenn ich es darauf angelegt hätte, Sie meine Herren zu unterhalten, könnte ich wohl einige Stellen jenes Briefes"" – er zog zwei rie- sige eng beschriebene Briefogen aus der Tasche und schwenkte sie – „hier vorlesen. Er würde sicher Wir- kung machen, da er mit einer etwas einfachen wenn auch immer gutgemeinten Schlauheit und mit viel Liebe zu dem Vater ihres Kindes geschrieben ist. Aber ich will weder Sie mehr unterhalten, als es zur Auflärung nötig ist noch vielleicht gar zum Empfang möglicherweise noch bestehende Gefühle meines Neffen verletzen, der den Brief, wenn er mag, in der Stille seines ihn schon erwartenden Zimmers zur Belehrung lesen kann."" Karl hatte aber keine Gefühle für jenes Mädchen. Im Gedränge einer immer mehr zurückgestoßenen Vergan- genheit saß sie in ihrer Küche neben dem Küchen- schrank, auf dessen Platte sie ihren Elbogen stützte. Sie sah ihn an, wenn er hin und wieder in die Küche kam, um ein Glas zum Wassertrinken für seinen Vater zu ho- len oder einen Aufrag seiner Mutter auszurichten. Manchmal schrieb sie in der vertrackten Stellung seitlich vom Küchenschrank einen Brief und holte sich die Ein- gebungen von Karls Gesicht. Manchmal hielt sie die Au- gen mit der Hand verdeckt, dann drang keine Anrede zu ihr. Manchmal kniete sie in ihrem engen Zimmerchen neben der Küche und betete zu einem hölzernen Kreuz, Karl beobachtete sie dann nur mit Scheu im Vorüber- gehn durch die Spalte der ein wenig geöffneten Tür. Manchmal jagte sie in der Küche herum und fuhr wie eine Hexe lachend zurück, wenn Karl ihr in den Weg kam. Manchmal schloß sie die Küchentüre, wenn Karl eingetreten war, und behielt die Klinke solange in der Hand bis er wegzugehn verlangte. Manchmal holte sie Sachen, die er gar nicht haben wollte, und drückte sie ihm schweigend in die Hände. Einmal aber sagte sie Karl!"" und führte ihn, der noch über die unerwartete Ansprache staunte, unter Grimassen seufzend in ihr Zimmerchen, das sie zusperrte. Würgend umarmte sie seinen Hals und während sie ihn bat sie zu entkleiden, entkleidete sie in Wirklichkeit ihn und legte ihn in ihr Bett, als wolle sie ihn von jetzt niemandem mehr lassen und ihn streicheln und pflegen bis zum Ende der Welt. Karl, o Du mein Karl"", rief sie als sehe sie ihn und bestätige sich seinen Besitz, während er nicht das gering- ste sah und sich unbehaglich in dem vielen warmen Bett- zeug fühlte, das sie eigens für ihn aufgehäuf zu haben schien. Dann legte sie sich auch zu ihm und wollte ir- gendwelche Geheimnisse von ihm erfahren, aber er konnte ihr keine sagen und sie ärgerte sich im Scherz oder Ernst, schüttelte ihn, horchte sein Herz ab, bot ihre Brust zum gleichen Abhorchen hin, wozu sie Karl aber nicht bringen konnte, drückte ihren nackten Bauch an seinen Leib, suchte mit der Hand, so widerlich daß Karl Kopf und Hals aus den Kissen heraus schüttelte, zwi- schen seinen Beinen, stieß dann den Bauch einigemale gegen ihn, ihm war als sei sie ein Teil seiner selbst und vielleicht aus diesem Grunde hatte ihn eine entsetzliche Hilfsbedürfigkeit ergriffen. Weinend kam er endlich nach vielen Wiedersehenswünschen ihrerseits in sein Bett. Das war alles gewesen und doch verstand es der Onkel, daraus eine große Geschichte zu machen. Und die Köchin hatte also auch an ihn gedacht und den On- kel von seiner Ankunf verständigt. Das war schön von ihr gehandelt und er würde es ihr wohl noch einmal vergelten.","""Now this Brummer,"" continued the uncle, had a child from my nephew, a healthy boy who was given the name Jacob at baptism, no doubt thinking of yours truly, which even in the certainly only very incidental mentions of my nephew must have made a great impression on the girl. Luckily, I say. Because the parents, in order to avoid paying the surcharge or other scandals that even touched themselves - I have to emphasize, I know neither the laws there nor the other circumstances of the parents, but only knows of two begging letters from the parents from earlier times, which I left unanswered but kept and which signify my only and moreover one-sided correspondence with them the whole time - there So, to avoid paying alimony and the scandal, the parents had their son transported to America, my dear nephew, with irresponsible un - enough equipment, as you can see - if you disregard the signs and wonders that are still alive in America, the boy would have been left to his own devices, probably perished in a little alleyway in New York Harbor if Not that maid in a letter addressed to me, which came into my possession the day before yesterday after long wanderings, would have told me the whole story, including a personal description of my nephew and, sensibly, the name of the ship. If I had set out to entertain you, gentlemen, I could probably read a few passages of that letter"" - he pulled two huge, closely written sheets of paper out of his pocket and waved them - ""here. It would certainly make an impact, because it is written with a somewhat simple, if always well-intentioned, cunning and with a lot of love for the father of your child. But I don't want to entertain you any more than is necessary for enlightenment, nor perhaps even hurt my nephew's possibly existing feelings for the reception, who, if he likes, can read the letter for instruction in the quiet of his waiting room."" But Karl had no feelings for that girl. In the crowd of an increasingly rejected past, she sat in her kitchen next to the kitchen cupboard, on the top of which she leaned her elbow. She looked at him when he occasionally came into the kitchen to get his father a glass of water to drink or to deliver an order from his mother. Sometimes she wrote a letter in the awkward position by the side of the kitchen cupboard and got the inspiration from Karl's face. Sometimes she covered her eyes with her hand, then no address came to her. Sometimes she would kneel in her cramped little room next to the kitchen and pray to a wooden cross, Karl would only watch her timidly as he passed through the crack of the slightly open door. Sometimes she would sprint around the kitchen and jump back, laughing like a witch, whenever Karl got in her way. Sometimes she closed the kitchen door when Karl came in and kept the handle in her hand until he asked to leave. Sometimes she would fetch things he didn't even want and silently put them in his hands. But once she said Karl!"" and led him, who was still amazed at the unexpected speech, and grimacing and sighing into her little room, which she locked. She choked on his neck and while she asked him to undress her, in reality she undressed him and put him in her bed as if from now on she didn't want to let anyone else caress and care for him until the end of the world. Karl, o you my Karl,"" she called out as if she saw him and confirmed his possessions while he didn't least saw and felt uncomfortable in the many warm sheets she seemed to have piled up especially for him. Then she lay down beside him too and wanted to know some secrets from him, but he couldn't tell her any and she annoyed her jokingly or seriously, shook him, listened to his heart, offered her breast to the same listening she was doing But Karl couldn't bring himself to do it, pressed her bare stomach against his body, felt between his legs with his hand so disgustingly that Karl shook his head and neck out of the pillow, then bumped his stomach several times against him, it seemed to him she was a part of himself and perhaps for that reason he had felt a terrible need for help. After many wishes to see her again, he finally came to bed crying. That was all, and yet the uncle knew how to make a big story out of it. And so the cook had thought of him too and informed the uncle of his arrival. That was nice of her and he would probably reward her again.","‘Well, this Brummer woman,’ the uncle continued, ‘went on to have a child by my nephew, a healthy boy who was christened Jakob, I suppose with my humble self in mind, because even my nephew’s no doubt passing references to me seem to have made a great impression on the girl. Just as well too, let me say. For the parents, to avoid paying for the child’s upkeep or to avoid being touched by the scandal themselves – I must state that I am not acquainted either with the laws of the place, or with the circumstances of the parents, of whom all I have are two begging letters that they sent me a long time ago, to which I never replied, but which I was careful to keep and which now constitute the only, one-sided, written communications between us in all these years – to resume then, the parents, to avoid scandal and paying maintenance, had their son, my dear nephew, transported to America with, as you may see, lamentably inadequate provision – thus leaving the boy, saving those miracles that still happen from time to time and particularly here in America, entirely to his own devices, so that he might easily have met his death in some dockside alleyway on his arrival, had not the maid written to me, which letter, after lengthy detours, came into my possession only the day before yesterday, and acquainted me with the whole story, together with a personal description of my nephew, and, very sensibly, also with the name of the ship on which he was travelling. Now, if it were my purpose at this point to entertain you, gentlemen, I might well read out some choice passages from this letter’ – he pulled from his pocket two enormous, closely written pages, and waved them around – ‘It would certainly make a hit, written as it is with a certain low, but always well-intentioned, cunning and with a good deal of affection for the father of her child. But neither do I want to amuse you more than is necessary, nor do I want to injure any tender feelings possibly still entertained by my nephew, who may, if he cares to, read the letter for himself in the privacy of his own room, which already awaits him.’ Actually, Karl had no feelings for the girl. In the crush of an ever-receding past, she was sitting in the Kitchen, with one elbow propped on the Kitchen dresser. She would look at him when he went into the Kitchen for a glass of water for his father, or to do an errand for his mother. Sometimes she would be sitting in her strange position by the dresser, writing a letter, and drawing inspiration from Karl’s face. Sometimes she would be covering her eyes with her hand, then it was impossible to speak to her. Sometimes she would be kneeling in her little room off the Kitchen, praying to a wooden cross, and Karl would shyly watch her through the open door as he passed. Sometimes she would be rushing about the Kitchen, and spin round, laughing like a witch whenever Karl got in her way. Sometimes she would shut the Kitchen door when Karl came in, and hold the doorknob in her hand until he asked her to let him out. Sometimes she would bring him things he hadn’t asked for, and silently press them into his hands. Once, though, she said ‘Karl!’ and led him – still astonished at the unexpected address – sighing and grimacing into her little room, and bolted it. Then she almost throttled him in an embrace, and, while asking him to undress her she actually undressed him, and laid him in her bed, as though she wanted to keep him all to herself from now on, and stroke him and look after him until the end of the world. ‘Karl, O my Karl!’ she said as if she could see him and wanted to confirm her possession of him, whereas he couldn’t see anything at all, and felt uncomfortable in all the warm bedding which she seemed to have piled up expressly for his sake. Then she lay down beside him, and asked to hear some secret or other, but he was unable to tell her any, then she was angry with him or pretended to be angry, he wasn’t sure which, and shook him, then she listened to the beating of his heart and offered him her breast for him to listen to, but Karl couldn’t bring himself to do that, she pressed her naked belly against his, reached her hand down , it felt so disgusting that Karl’s head and neck leapt out of the pillows, down between his legs, pushed her belly against his a few times, he felt as though she were a part of him, and perhaps for that reason he felt seized by a shocking helplessness. He finally got to his own bed in tears, and after many fond goodnights from her. That had been all, and yet the uncle had managed to turn it into a big deal. So the cook had thought of him, and informed his uncle that he was arriving. That was nice of her, and one day he would like to pay her back.","“Well, this Brummer woman,” his uncle continued, “had a child by my nephew, a healthy boy, who was given the name Jakob at baptism, no doubt in honor of my humble self, and even though any references to me could only have been very casual they must nonetheless have left a big impression on the girl. And I’d say that was quite fortunate. For to avoid paying child support or whatever part of the scandal touched them directly—and here I should emphasize that I have no knowledge of the laws there nor of his parents’ circumstances in other respects, and that everything I know comes from two begging letters I received from his parents a number of years ago, which I kept but never answered, and this was the only, and naturally one-sided, correspondence I’ve had with them the entire time—well, to avoid those child support payments and the whole scandal, his parents shipped off their son, my dear nephew, to America and, as one can see, made such inadequate and indeed irresponsible provision for him that if the boy had been left to fend for himself in this manner—leaving aside the omens and wonders one can still encounter, especially here in America—he would no doubt have gone to seed quickly in some alleyway or other in New York Harbor if the servant girl hadn’t given me a complete account along with a description of my nephew and also, very cleverly, the ship’s name in a letter that after various lengthy detours reached me only the day before yesterday. If my main intention was to entertain you, gentlemen, there are several passages in this letter”—from his pocket he drew two enormous sheets of paper filled with cramped writing and waved them about—“that I could certainly read aloud. It would definitely leave an impression on you, for it is written with a rather artless, if always well-meant, cunning and with much love for the father of her child. But I don’t wish to entertain you more than is necessary for the sake of clarification; nor do I wish to hurt any feelings my nephew may still have for the girl, especially just as he’s being made welcome here; if he wishes, he may for his edification read this letter in the quiet of his room, which is now ready to receive him.” Karl, however, had no feelings for that girl. Amid the crush of a past that he had pushed back ever further, she sat in the kitchen beside the cabinet, with her elbows resting on the counter top. She would look at him when he went to the kitchen to fetch a glass of water for his father or to run an errand for his mother. Sometimes she would be sitting beside the cabinet in that same awkward position, writing a letter and drawing inspiration from Karl’s face. Sometimes she would hide her eyes with her hand, and then no greeting could reach her. Sometimes she would be kneeling in her narrow little room next to the kitchen, praying to a wooden cross, and at such moments when he walked past, Karl would merely watch her timidly through the slightly open door. Sometimes she would race around the kitchen, and whenever Karl happened to get in her way, she would shrink back, breaking out in witchlike laughter. Sometimes she would close the kitchen door after Karl had entered and keep her hand on the knob until he asked for permission to leave. Sometimes she would fetch things that he did not even want and press them into his hands without saying a word. On one occasion, however, she said “Karl!” and then, grimacing and moaning, led Karl, who was still astonished at being addressed by his first name, into her little room, which she locked behind her. She put her arms around his neck and seized it in a stranglehold, and though she had asked him to undress her, it was she who undressed him and put him in her bed, as if she would never surrender him to anyone else and wanted to go on stroking him and caring for him until the end of the world. “Karl, oh my Karl,” she cried, as if she could see him and was confirming that she now had possession of him, whereas he could see nothing and felt uncomfortable under the many warm bedclothes that she had evidently heaped up especially for him. Then she lay down beside him and wanted him to tell her secrets, but he had none to tell, and she became annoyed, whether jokingly or in earnest, shook him, listened to his heart, offered him her breast so that he too could listen but could not induce Karl to do so, pressed her naked belly against his body, searched between his legs with her hand—in such a revolting manner that Karl shook his head and throat out from under the quilts—then pushed her belly up against him several times; it felt as if she were part of him; hence perhaps the terrible helplessness that overcame him. In tears, after listening to repeated wishes that they should meet again, he reached his bed. There was no more to it than that, but his uncle still managed to make a big thing of it. So the cook had actually thought about him and had let his uncle know he was coming. That was good of her, and at some point he might well repay her."
"Sie giengen aber weiter und kamen an eine Türe, die oben einen kleinen Vorgiebel hatte, der von kleinen ver- goldeten Karyatiden getragen war. Für eine Schiffsein- richtung sah das recht verschwenderisch aus. Karl war, wie er merkte niemals in diese Gegend gekommen, die wahrscheinlich während der Fahrt den Passagieren der ersten und zweiten Klasse vorbehalten war, während jetzt vor der großen Schiffsreinigung die Trennungstü- ren ausgehoben waren. Sie waren auch tatsächlich eini- gen Männern schon begegnet, die Besen an der Schulter trugen und den Heizer gegrüßt hatten. Karl staunte über den großen Betrieb, in seinem Zwischendeck hatte er davon freilich wenig erfahren. Entlang der Gänge zogen sich auch Drähte elektrischer Leitungen und eine kleine Glocke hörte man immerfort.","They went on, however, and came to a door which had a small pediment at the top, which was supported by small gilded caryatids. That looked rather wasteful for a ship's interior. As he noticed, Karl had never been in this area, which was probably reserved for first- and second-class passengers during the journey, while now the separating doors were open in front of the big ship cleaning. In fact, they had already met a few men with brooms on their shoulders who had greeted the stoker. Karl was amazed at how busy it was, although he hadn't heard much about it on his steerage. Wires of electric cables ran along the corridors and a small bell could be heard constantly.","They for their part carried on and reached a door that had a little pediment above it, supported on little gilded caryatids. For something on a ship, it looked distinctly lavish. Karl realized he had never been to this part of the ship, which had probably been reserved for the use of first and second class passengers during the crossing, but now the separating doors had been thrown open prior to the great ship’s cleaning. They had in fact encountered a few men carrying brooms over their shoulders who greeted the stoker. Karl was amazed at all the bustle, between decks where he had been he had had no sense of it at all. Along the passages ran electrical wires, and one continually heard the ringing of a little bell.","Nevertheless they continued on their way and soon reached a door capped with a little pediment supported by small gilded caryatids. As a fixture on a ship, it looked fairly extravagant. Karl realized that he had never entered this area, which was probably reserved during the voyage for first- and second-class passengers, but just before the great ship cleaning, the partition doors had been taken down. Indeed, they had already encountered several men carrying brooms on their shoulders, who had greeted the stoker. Karl marveled at the bustle; in steerage he had for sure witnessed little of this. Also, there were electrical cords strung along both sides of the corridor, and one could hear a little bell ringing continuously."
"„Das stimmt"", sagte der Student und lachte, „riecht das Kanapee noch danach?""","""That's right,"" said the student and laughed, ""does the canapé still smell like it?""","‘That’s right,’ said the student, with a laugh, ‘does the sofa still smell of it?’","“Yes, it’s true,” said the student, laughing, “does the settee still reek of it?”"
"„Frau Oberköchin"", sagte Karl, der sich noch einmal aufrafe, aber nur um Terese die Antwort zu ersparen, zu keinem andern Zweck, „ich glaube nicht, daß ich Ihnen irgendwie Schande gemacht habe und nach genau- er Untersuchung müßte das auch jeder andere finden.""","""Frau Oberkochin,"" said Karl, who got up again, but only to spare Terese the answer, for no other purpose, ""I don't think I've disgraced you in any way, and after a closer examination everyone should have too find others.""","‘Madam,’ said Karl, making one last effort, but for the sole purpose of saving Therese from having to make some reply, ‘I don’t think I have disgraced you in any way, and on closer inspection I don’t think anyone would claim that I had.’","“Madame Head Cook,” said Karl, pulling himself together once again for the sole purpose of sparing Therese the obligation of answering, “I don’t think I disgraced you at all, and after examining the matter carefully, everybody else would have to come to the same conclusion.”"
"„Allerdings"", sagte dieser mit einer kleinen Neigung für die Aufmerksamkeit dankend. Und fragte dann Karl nochmals: „Wie heißen Sie eigentlich?""","""Certainly,"" he said with a slight inclination, thanking him for the attention. And then asked Karl again: ""What's your name?""","‘Indeed I did,’ he replied, thanking him for the courtesy with a little bow. And he asked Karl again: ‘What is your name please?’","“Certainly,” said the latter, thanking the captain for his attentiveness with a little bow. And he reiterated the question that he had asked Karl: “ So what’s your name?”"
"„Und ohne Rock bist Du entlassen worden?"" fragte der Polizeimann. „Nun ja"", sagte Karl, also auch in Amerika gehörte es zur Art der Behörden, das was sie sahen noch eigens zu fragen. (Wie hatte sein Vater bei der Beschaffung des Reisepasses über die nutzlose Fra- gerei der Behörden sich ärgern müssen.) Karl hatte gro- ße Lust, wegzulaufen, sich irgendwo zu verstecken und keine Fragen mehr anhören zu müssen. Und nun stellte gar der Polizeimann jene Frage, vor der sich Karl am meisten gefürchtet und in deren unruhiger Voraussicht er sich bisher wahrscheinlich unvorsichtiger benommen hatte, als es sonst geschehen wäre: „In welchem Hotel warst Du denn angestellt?"" Er senkte den Kopf und antwortete nicht, auf diese Frage wollte er unbedingt nicht antworten. Es durfe nicht geschehn, daß er von einem Polizeimann escortiert wieder ins Hotel occiden- tal zurückkäme, daß dort Verhöre stattfanden, zu denen seine Freunde und Feinde beigezogen würden, daß die Oberköchin ihre schon sehr schwach gewordene gute Meinung über Karl gänzlich aufgab, da sie ihn, den sie in der Pension Brenner vermutete, von einem Polizeimann aufgegriffen, in Hemdärmeln, ohne ihre Visitkarte zu- rückgekehrt fand, während der Oberkellner vielleicht nur voll Verständnis nicken, der Oberportier dagegen von der Hand Gottes sprechen würde, die den Lumpen endlich gefunden habe.","""And you were released without your coat?"" asked the policeman. ""Well yes,"" said Karl, so in America too it was part of the way the authorities asked specifically what they saw. (How annoyed his father had been at the useless questioning of the authorities when he was getting his passport.) Karl had a great desire to run away, to hide somewhere and not have to listen to any more questions. And now the policeman even asked the question that Karl feared most and in whose restless foresight he had probably behaved more carelessly than he would otherwise have done: ""In which hotel were you employed?"" He lowered his head and He didn't answer, he absolutely didn't want to answer that question, it must not happen that he was escorted back to the Hotel Occidental by a policeman, that interrogations were taking place there, to which his friends and enemies were being called, that the head cook was already doing hers completely gave up her good opinion of Karl, which had become very weak, because she found him, whom she assumed to be in the Pension Brenner, picked up by a policeman, in shirt sleeves, returned without his business card, while the head waiter perhaps only nodded in understanding, the head porter on the other hand would speak of the hand of God finally finding the rag.","‘And you were dismissed without your jacket?’ asked the policeman. ‘ Well, yes,’ said Karl, apparently even in America the authorities liked to ask about things they could perfectly well see with their own eyes. (How his father in obtaining his passport had been annoyed by the pointless questioning of the authorities.) Karl was sorely tempted to run away somewhere and not have to endure any more questions. But then the policeman asked the one question that Karl had most been afraid of, and in fearful anticipation of which he had probably behaved more thoughtlessly than he would have done otherwise: ‘ In what hotel were you employed?’ He lowered his head and didn’t answer, he really didn’t want to answer that question. He must at all costs avoid being taken back to the Hotel Occidental under police escort, facing further inquiries to which his friends and enemies would be summoned to appear, the Head Cook completely abandoning her already somewhat qualified good opinion of Karl, seeing him, whom she had supposed to be at the Pension Brenner, picked up by a policeman, in shirtsleeves, returned without her visiting card; the Head Waiter might perhaps merely nod sagely, the Head Porter though speak of the hand of god that had finally nabbed the scoundrel.","“And you were let go without a jacket?” asked the policeman. “Well yes,” said Karl; so in America too the authorities made a point of asking questions even when they could see perfectly well for themselves. How annoyed his father had become over the useless questions the authorities had asked when they were applying for his passport. Karl had a great desire to run away and hide somewhere instead of having to listen to more such questions. And the policeman even asked the question that Karl had most feared, and probably because of the unease with which he had anticipated the question, he responded more carelessly than he might otherwise have done. “Which hotel did you work at?” He lowered his head and did not answer; that was a question he absolutely did not want to answer. What had to be avoided at all costs was the following: that he would be escorted back by the police to the Occidental Hotel, that hearings would be held to which his friends and enemies would be summoned, and that the head cook would completely abandon her favorable, if already weakening, opinion of Karl ; she had thought he was at the Pension Brenner and would now find that he had come back in his shirtsleeves, did not have her visiting card, and had been picked up by a policeman; whereas the head waiter would perhaps give a knowing nod, and the head porter would talk of the hand of God that had finally caught the rascal."
"Es mußte eine große Stadt in der Nähe sein, denn gleich der erste Saal des Hotels, den Karl betrat, war von einer lauten Menge erfüllt und an dem Buffet das sich an einer Längswand und an den zwei Seitenwänden hinzog, liefen unauförlich viele Kellner mit weißen Schürzen vor der Brust und konnten doch die ungeduldigen Gäste nicht zufriedenstellen, denn immer wieder hörte man an den verschiedensten Stellen Flüche und Fäuste die auf den Tisch schlugen. Karl wurde von niemandem beach- tet; es gab auch im Saale selbst keine Bedienung, die Gäste, die an winzigen, bereits zwischen drei Tischnach- barn verschwindenden Tischen saßen, holten alles, was sie wünschten beim Buffet. Auf allen Tischchen stand eine große Flasche mit Öl, Essig oder dergleichen und alle Speisen, die vom Buffet geholt wurden, wurden vor dem Essen aus dieser Flasche übergössen. Wollte Karl überhaupt erst zum Buffet kommen, wo ja dann wahr- scheinlich, besonders bei seiner großen Bestellung, die Schwierigkeiten erst beginnen würden, mußte er sich zwischen vielen Tischen durchdrängen, was natürlich bei aller Vorsicht nicht ohne grobe Belästigung der Gäste durchzuführen war, die jedoch alles wie gefühllos hin- nahmen, selbst als Karl einmal allerdings gleichfalls von einem Gast gegen ein Tischchen gestoßen worden war, das er fast umgeworfen hätte. Er entschuldigte sich zwar, wurde aber offenbar nicht verstanden, verstand übrigens auch nicht das geringste von dem was man ihm zurief. Beim Buffet fand er mit Mühe ein kleines freies Plätz- chen, auf dem ihm eine lange Weile die Aussicht durch die aufgestützten Elbogen seiner Nachbarn genommen war. Es schien hier überhaupt eine Sitte, die Elbogen aufzustützen und die Faust an die Schläfe zu drücken; Karl mußte daran denken, wie der Lateinprofessor Dr. Krumpal gerade diese Haltung gehaßt hatte und wie er immer heimlich und unversehens herangekommen war und mittels eines plötzlich erscheinenden Lineals mit schmerzhafem Ruck die Elbogen von den Tischen ge- streif hatte.","There must be a large city nearby, because the first room in the hotel that Karl entered was filled with a loud crowd, and at the buffet, which stretched along one long wall and the two side walls, many waiters with white ones were constantly running Aprons in front of the chest and yet could not satisfy the impatient guests, because again and again you could hear curses and fists hitting the table in different places. Nobody paid any attention to Karl; There was also no service in the hall itself, the guests, who were sitting at tiny tables that had already disappeared between three neighboring tables, got everything they wanted from the buffet. On every table there was a large bottle with oil, vinegar or the like and all dishes that were taken from the buffet were poured over them from this bottle before they were eaten. If Karl wanted to get to the buffet at all, where the difficulties would probably only begin, especially with his large order, he had to push his way between many tables, which of course could not be done without grossly annoying the guests, who However, they accepted everything without feeling, even when Karl had been pushed against a table by a guest, which he almost knocked over. Although he apologized, he was obviously not understood, and he didn't understand the slightest bit of what was being shouted at him either. At the buffet he found with difficulty a small free spot where, for a long time, his view was blocked by his neighbors' propped elbows. It seemed customary here to propped up one's elbows and press one's fist to one's temple; Karl had to think about how the Latin professor Dr. Krumpal had hated just this attitude and how he had always come up secretly and unexpectedly and, with a painful jerk, had brushed his elbows off the tables with a ruler that had suddenly appeared.","There must be a large town nearby, because the very first lounge that Karl set foot in at the hotel was full of a crowd of noisy people, and at the buffet, which ran down the length of the room as well as its two shorter sides, numerous waiters in white aprons were running about ceaselessly, and still they couldn’t satisfy the impatient guests, as one could hear from the swearing on all sides and the noise of fists being banged on tables. No one paid the slightest attention to Karl; nor was there any service in the room itself, rather the guests, who were seated at tiny tables, swamped by other tables on all sides, foraged for themselves at the buffet. All the tables had a large bottle of oil, vinegar or somesuch on them, and all the dishes that were obtained from the buffet were doused with the liquid before being eaten. In order for Karl to reach the buffet, where the difficulties which faced him, with such a large order, would really only begin, he first had to squeeze his way through many tables, which, for all his caution, couldn’t be done without grossly disturbing the guests, who took it all as if they were completely insentient, even on the occasion when Karl, albeit pushed from behind, stumbled against one of the little tables and almost upset it. He apologized of course, but no one seemed to understand, nor did he understand anything that they called out to him either. With much difficulty, he managed to find a little space at the buffet, although his view was restricted for a long time by the propped elbows of the people either side of him. It seemed to be the custom here to rest one’s elbows on the table, and to press one’s fists against one’s temples; Karl remembered how much Dr Krumpal, his Latin teacher, had hated that posture, and how he would quietly and surreptitiously sneak up, and with a suddenly brandished ruler brush an offending elbow abruptly and painfully from the table.","There must have been a big city close by, for the very first hall in the hotel that Karl entered was filled with a noisy crowd, and at the buffet, which ran down the length of one wall and across two side walls, numerous waiters constantly ran about with white aprons slung across their chests without quite succeeding in satisfying their impatient guests, for everywhere one could hear cursing and fists hitting the table. No one paid any attention to Karl; there was no table service in the hall itself; sitting in groups of three at tables so tiny as to be almost invisible, the guests fetched themselves everything they needed from the buffet. Standing on each little table was a large bottle of oil, vinegar, or the like, which they first poured over all the food that they had carried over from the buffet. If Karl attempted to reach the buffet—where, especially with such a large order, the real difficulties would probably begin—he would have to force his way between many tables, and even if he were as careful as possible, he could not do so without rudely disturbing the guests, who however endured everything with apparent indifference, even when a guest bumped Karl against a little table, which nearly got knocked over. Although he apologized, they evidently did not understand him; nor could he understand a single word they called out to him. At the buffet he finally succeeded in finding a spot, where his view was momentarily blocked by the elbows that his neighbors kept propped up. Here it seemed customary to sit with your elbows propped up and your fists pressed against your temples; Karl could not help thinking of his Latin teacher Dr. Krumpal, who had hated that particular posture and who would always approach by stealth and in one painful sweeping motion, by means of a ruler that suddenly appeared out of nowhere, brush one’s elbows off the table."
"Es war ja auch beiweitem nicht das einzige Vergnügen, das er hatte. In seinem Zimmer stand ein amerikanischer Schreibtisch bester Sorte, wie sich ihn sein Vater seit Jahren gewünscht und auf den verschiedensten Verstei- gerungen um einen ihm erreichbaren billigen Preis zu kaufen gesucht hatte, ohne daß es ihm bei seinen kleinen Mitteln jemals gelungen wäre. Natürlich war dieser Tisch mit jenen angeblich amerikanischen Schreibti- schen, wie sie sich auf europäischen Versteigerungen herumtreiben nicht zu vergleichen. Er hatte z. B. in sei- nem Aufsatz hundert Fächer verschiedenster Größe und selbst der Präsident der Union hätte für jeden seiner Akten einen passenden Platz gefunden, aber außerdem war an der Seite ein Regulator und man konnte durch Drehen an der Kurbel die verschiedensten Umstellungen und Neueinrichtungen der Fächer nach Belieben und Bedarf erreichen. Dünne Seitenwändchen senkten sich langsam und bildeten den Boden neu sich erhebender oder die Decke neu aufsteigender Fächer; schon nach einer Umdrehung hatte der Aufsatz ein ganz anderes Aussehen und alles gieng je nachdem man die Kurbel drehte langsam oder unsinnig rasch vor sich. Es war eine neueste Erfindung, erinnerte aber Karl sehr lebhaf an die Krippenspiele die zuhause auf dem Christmarkt den staunenden Kindern gezeigt wurden und auch Karl war of in seine Winterkleider eingepackt davor gestanden und hatte ununterbrochen die Kurbeldrehung, die ein alter Mann ausführte, mit den Wirkungen im Krippen- spiel verglichen, mit dem stockenden Vorwärtskommen der heiligen drei Könige, dem Aufglänzen des Sternes und dem befangenen Leben im heiligen Stall. Und im- mer war es ihm erschienen, als ob die Mutter die hinter ihm stand nicht genau genug alle Ereignisse verfolge, er hatte sie zu sich hingezogen, bis er sie an seinem Rücken fühlte, und hatte ihr solange mit lauten Ausrufen ver- borgenere Erscheinungen gezeigt, vielleicht ein Häs- chen, das vorn im Gras abwechselnd Männchen machte und sich dann wieder zum Lauf bereitete, bis die Mutter ihm den Mund zuhielt und wahrscheinlich in ihre frühe- re Unachtsamkeit verfiel. Der Tisch war freilich nicht dazu gemacht um an solche Dinge zu erinnern, aber in der Geschichte der Erfindungen bestand wohl ein ähn- lich undeutlicher Zusammenhang wie in Karls Erinne- rungen. Der Onkel war zum Unterschied von Karl mit diesem Schreibtisch durchaus nicht einverstanden, nur hatte er eben für Karl einen ordentlichen Schreibtisch kaufen wollen und solche Schreibtische waren jetzt sämtlich mit dieser Neueinrichtung versehn, deren Vor- zug nämlich auch darin bestand, bei älteren Schreibti- schen ohne große Kosten angebracht werden zu können. Immerhin unterließ der Onkel nicht, Karl zu raten, den Regulator möglichst gar nicht zu verwenden; um die Wirkung des Rates zu verstärken behauptete der Onkel, die Maschinerie sei sehr empfindlich, leicht zu verderben und die Wiederherstellung sehr kostspielig. Es war nicht schwer einzusehn, daß solche Bemerkungen nur Aus- flüchte waren, wenn man sich auch andererseits sagen mußte, daß der Regulator sehr leicht zu fixieren war, was der Onkel jedoch nicht tat.","It was by no means the only pleasure he had. In his room was an American desk of the best kind, the kind his father had wanted for years and had tried to buy at various auctions for a cheap price he could reach, without ever being able to find it given his small means. Of course, this table couldn't be compared with those supposedly American desks that you see hanging around at European auctions. He had e.g. For example, in his essay there were a hundred compartments of various sizes and even the President of the Union would have found a suitable place for each of his files, but there was also a regulator on the side and by turning the crank you could rearrange and reorganize the compartments in a wide variety of ways available at will and as needed. Thin side walls slowly descended and formed the bottom of newly rising compartments or the ceiling of newly rising compartments; after just one turn, the attachment had a completely different appearance and everything went slowly or absurdly fast, depending on how you turned the crank. It was a recent invention, but reminded Karl very vividly of the nativity plays that were shown to the astonished children at the Christmas market at home, and Karl, too, often stood in front of it wrapped in his winter clothes and had the crank handle turned continuously by an old man, with the effects compared in the nativity play with the halting progress of the three holy kings, the shining of the star and the self-conscious life in the holy stable. And it had always seemed to him as if his mother, who was standing behind him, was not following all the events closely enough, he had pulled her towards him until he felt her on his back, and for that long had more hidden apparitions with loud exclamations shown, perhaps a bunny, which alternately crouched in the grass in front and then got ready to run again until the mother covered its mouth and probably lapsed into her earlier inattention. Of course, the table was not made to commemorate such things, but in the history of inventions there was probably a similarly vague connection as in Karl's memories. In contrast to Karl, the uncle did not agree with this desk at all, only he had just wanted to buy a decent desk for Karl and such desks were now all provided with this new arrangement, the advantage of which was that in older desks can be installed without great expense. At least the uncle didn't fail to advise Karl not to use the regulator at all if possible; to increase the effect of the advice, the uncle maintained that the machinery was very delicate, easily spoiled, and very costly to restore. It wasn't hard to see that such remarks were just evasions, when, on the other hand, one had to admit that the regulator was very easy to fix, which the uncle didn't do.","After all, it was far from being the only pleasure in his life. In his room there was an American writing desk of the very finest sort, one of the kind his father had been longing for for years, and had tried to find at an affordably cheap price at various auctions, without ever having been able to afford one with his small means. Of course his desk was nothing like those so-called American desks that turn up at European auctions. For instance the top part of it had a hundred different compartments of all sizes, so that even the President of the Union would have found room for each of his files in it, but even better than that , it had an adjuster at the side, so that by turning a handle one could rearrange and adjust the compartments in whatever way one wanted or needed. Thin lateral partitions slowly descended to form the floors of newly created compartments or the ceilings of enlarged ones; with just one turn of the handle, the appearance of the top would be completely transformed, and one could do it either slowly or at incredible speed, depending on how one turned the handle. It was a very modern invention, but it reminded Karl vividly of the nativity scenes that were demonstrated to astonished children at the Christmas Fairs at home. Karl himself, warmly dressed, had often stood in front of these nativities, and had incessantly compared the turning of the handle, which an old man performed, with the effect it had on the scene, the halting progress of the three Kings, the shining star of Bethlehem and the shy life in the holy stable. And always it had seemed to him as though his mother standing behind him wasn’t following the events closely enough and he had pulled her to him, until he felt her against his back, and he had drawn her attention to various more subtle manifestations by loud shouts, say a rabbit that was alternately sitting up and making to run in the long grass at the front, until his mother put her hand over his mouth and presumably reverted to her previous dullness. Of course the desk hadn’t been designed to recall such things, but the history of inventions was probably full of such vague connections as Karl’s memory. Unlike Karl, the uncle was not at all pleased with the desk, but he had wanted to buy Karl a proper desk, and all desks were now fitted with this contraption, which had the added advantage of being inexpensive to mount on older desks. Still, the uncle kept urging Karl preferably to avoid using the adjuster at all; to back up his advice the uncle claimed that the machinery was very delicate, easily broken and very expensive to repair. It wasn’t hard to see that such claims were mere excuses if one reminded oneself that it was very easy to immobilize the adjuster, which the uncle never did.","However, that was by no means his sole pleasure. In his room stood an American desk of the finest kind, such as his father had wanted for years and had sought to buy at a reasonable price at all kinds of auctions, though owing to his limited means, without success. Of course, there was no comparison between this desk here and those supposedly American desks that made the rounds at European auctions. For instance, it had in its base a hundred drawers of all sizes, in which even the President of the Union could have found a suitable place for each of his files, and what’s more it even had a regulator on the side, so that simply by turning the handle one could move about and rearrange the drawers in all sorts of combinations to suit one’s every need and whim. Thin little side panels would descend slowly, forming the bottoms of new drawers or the tops of others that rose from below; even after only a single winding, the entire base looked completely different, and depending on the speed at which one turned the handle, everything moved slowly or at a crazy pace. Though it was a most recent invention, it vividly reminded Karl of the nativity scenes at home that were shown to gaping children at the Christmas market, and Karl too had often stood before it, bundled up in his winter clothes, continually comparing the revolutions of the crank, which was being turned by an old man, with the unfolding nativity scene, the faltering progress of the three holy kings, the sudden illumination of the star, and the cramped life in the holy manger. And it always seemed as if his mother, who stood behind him, was not paying sufficient heed to all of the movements; after drawing her over until he could feel her body pressing against his back, he had spoken in a loud voice, continually pointing out the less conspicuous figures, such as a small hare lying on the grass in the foreground, which sat up and begged and then got ready to start running again, until his mother put her hand over his mouth and presumably relapsed into her prior inattentiveness. True, the desk had not been manufactured for the purpose of stirring such memories, yet throughout the history of inventions people had made associations that were just as indistinct as those in Karl’s recollections. Unlike Karl, his uncle was by no means in favor of this desk; he had merely wanted to buy Karl a regular desk, and all such desks now came equipped with this new mechanism, which possessed the further advantage that it could be attached to older desks at no great cost. Nevertheless Karl’s uncle did not refrain from advising him that he should not use the regulator at all if possible; in an effort to reinforce this advice, his uncle claimed that the mechanism was very sensitive, could be easily ruined, and was expensive to repair. It wasn’t hard to see that such comments were merely excuses, especially since one would have needed to add that the regulator could be easily fixed, which his uncle, however, neglected to do."
"Aber gleich war alles vergessen, denn Brunelda flü- sterte ganz müde, als werde sie von dem heißen Wasser überflutet: „Das Parfüm! Bringt das Parfüm!"" „Das Par- füm!"" schrie Delamarche. „Rührt Euch."" Ja aber wo war das Parfüm? Karl sah Robinson an, Robinson sah Karl an. Karl merkte, daß er hier alles allein in die Hand nehmen müsse, Robinson hatte keine Ahnung wo das Parfüm war, er legte sich einfach auf den Boden, fuhr immerfort mit beiden Armen unter dem Kanapee her- um, beförderte aber nichts anderes als Knäuel von Staub und Frauenhaaren heraus. Karl eilte zuerst zum Wasch- tisch, der gleich bei der Türe stand, aber in seinen Schubladen fanden sich nur alte englische Romane, Zeit- schrifen und Noten vor und alles war so überfüllt, daß man die Schubladen nicht schließen konnte, wenn man sie einmal aufgemacht hatte. „Das Parfüm"", seufzte un- terdessen Brunelda. „Wie lange das dauert! Ob ich heute noch mein Parfüm bekomme!"" Bei dieser Ungeduld Bruneldas durfe natürlich Karl nirgends gründlich su- chen, er mußte sich auf den oberflächlichen ersten Ein- druck verlassen. Im Waschkasten war die Flasche nicht, auf dem Waschkasten standen überhaupt nur alte Fläsch- chen mit Medizinen und Salben, alles andere war jeden- falls schon in den Waschraum getragen worden. Viel- leicht war die Flasche in der Schublade des Eßtisches. Auf dem Weg zum Eßtisch aber – Karl dachte nur an das Parfüm, sonst an nichts – stieß er hefig mit Robinson zusammen, der das Suchen unter dem Kanapee endlich aufgegeben hatte und in einer aufdämmernden Ahnung vom Standort des Parfüms wie blind Karl entgegenlief. Man hörte deutlich das Zusammenschlagen der Kopfe, Karl blieb stumm, Robinson hielt zwar im Lauf nicht ein, schrie aber um sich den Schmerz zu erleichtern, andauernd und übertrieben laut.","But everything was soon forgotten, because Brunelda whispered, very tired, as if she were being flooded by the hot water: “The perfume! Bring the perfume!"" ""The perfume!"" shouted Delamarche. ""Touch yourself."" Yes, but where was the perfume? Karl looked at Robinson, Robinson looked at Karl. Karl noticed that he had to take care of everything himself, Robinson had no idea where the perfume was, he just hung up the floor, kept running his arms around under the settee, but brought out nothing but balls of dust and women's hair.First Karl hurried to the washbasin, which was right by the door, but there were only old ones in his drawers English novels, magazines and sheet music and everything was so crowded that once you opened the drawers you couldn't close them.""The perfume,"" Brunelda sighed meanwhile. ""How long that takes! Will I still get my perfume today?"" Given Brunelda's impatience, Karl was of course not allowed to look anywhere, he had to rely on the superficial first impression. The bottle wasn't in the lavatory, only old bottles were on the lavatory. Little things with medicines and ointments, everything else had in any case already been taken to the washroom. Perhaps the bottle was in the drawer of the dining table. But on the way to the dining table - Karl only thought of the perfume, nothing else - bumped into it he was with Robinson, who had finally given up looking under the sofa and ran blindly towards Karl with a dawning inkling of the location of the perfume.You could clearly hear the banging of their heads, Karl remained silent, although Robinson did not stop running, he screamed but to relieve the pain, constant and exaggeratedly loud.","But all that was straightaway forgotten, because Brunelda whispered very feebly, as though overcome by the hot water‘My perfume! I want my perfume!’ ‘Her perfume!’ shouted Delamarche. ‘Get to it.’ Yes, but where was the perfume? Karl looked at Robinson, Robinson looked at Karl. Karl saw that he would have to take the responsibility on his own shoulders, Robinson evidently had no idea where the perfume was, he just lay down on the floor and kept waving both his arms about under the sofa, bringing to light nothing more than tangles of dust and woman’s hair. Karl first hurried to the washstand that was right by the door, but its drawers contained nothing but old English novels, journals and sheet music, and all of them so crammed full that it was impossible to shut them again, once they’d been opened. ‘The perfume!’ groaned Brunelda in the meantime. ‘How long it’s taking! I wonder if I’ll get my perfume today!’ In view of her impatience, Karl of course couldn’t possibly look thoroughly anywhere, he had to rely on cursory impressions. The bottle wasn’t in the washstand, and on top of it were only old jars of medicine and ointments, everything else must have already been taken into the washroom. Maybe the bottle was in the drawer of the dining-table. But, on the way to the table – Karl had only the perfume in his thoughts, nothing else – he collided violently with Robinson, who had finally given up looking under the sofa, and following some dim notion where the perfume might be, had walked blindly into Karl. The clash of heads was clearly audible. Karl remained mute, Robinson carried on on his way, but to relieve his pain, let out a long and exaggeratedly loud howl.","But all this was immediately forgotten, for Brunelda whispered very wearily, as if she were being deluged by the hot water: “The perfume! Bring the perfume!” “The perfume,” shouted Delamarche. “Get a move on.” Yes, but where was the perfume? Karl glanced at Robinson, Robinson in turn at Karl. Karl realized that he would have to take charge of everything himself; Robinson had no idea where the perfume was but merely lay down on the floor and waved both arms under the settee, which yielded only balls of dust and women’s hair. First Karl rushed to the washstand next to the door, but all he could find were various old novels in English and some magazines and sheet music, since the drawers were so overstuffed that when one finally managed to open them, it was impossible to get them to close again. “The perfume,” sighed Brunelda. “It’s taking you so long! Will I even get my perfume today!” Karl could not conduct a proper search since Brunelda was so impatient that he had to rely on a cursory first glance. The bottle was not in the washstand; it merely contained some old medicine and ointment bottles, for everything else had been taken in to the washroom. Perhaps the bottle lay in a drawer of the dining room table. But on his way to the table—Karl thought only of the perfume and of nothing else—he collided with Robinson, who had finally given up searching under the settee and who, overcome by a sudden intuition about the whereabouts of the perfume, ran toward Karl, as though he were blind. One could clearly hear their heads collide; Karl remained silent, and though Robinson did not cease running, he sought to ease his pain by continually shouting out in an exaggeratedly loud voice."
"Der Heizer legte nur die Stirn in Falten, als suche er den Ausdruck für das was er zu sagen habe. Im übrigen sah er auf seine und Karls Hand hinab.","The stoker just frowned as if trying to find an expression for what he had to say. For the rest, he looked down at his hand and Karl's.","The stoker furrowed his brow, as though looking for words for what he wanted to say. He looked down at his hand and Karl’s.",The stoker merely furrowed his brow as if he were seeking the right words with which to convey his thoughts. He glanced down at Karl’s hands and at his own.
"„Darauf kommt es doch nicht an, bei einer Sache der Gerechtigkeit"", sagte Karl. Er stand zwischen dem On- kel und dem Kapitän und glaubte vielleicht durch diese Stellung beeinflußt die Entscheidung in der Hand zu haben.","""That doesn't really matter in a matter of justice,"" said Karl. He stood between his uncle and the captain and believed, perhaps influenced by this position, that he had the decision in his hands.","‘But that’s not the point, it’s a question of justice,’ said Karl. He was standing between the captain and his uncle, and perhaps influenced by that position, he thought the decision lay in his hands.","“But that’s beside the point when it’s a matter of justice,” said Karl. Karl stood between his uncle and the captain, and, perhaps swayed by his vantage point, he believed that the decision now lay in his hands."
"„Es ist unmöglich sich zu verteidigen, wenn nicht gu- ter Wille da ist"", sagte sich Karl und antwortete dem Oberkellner nicht mehr, so sehr darunter wahrscheinlich Terese litt. Er wußte, daß alles was er sagen konnte, hinterher ganz anders aussehen würde als es gemeint gewesen war und daß es nur der Art der Beurteilung überlassen bliebe, Gutes oder Böses vorzufinden.","""It's impossible to defend yourself if you don't have good intentions,"" Karl said to himself and didn't answer the head waiter anymore, no matter how much Terese probably suffered from it. He knew that everything he could say would look completely different afterwards than it was meant to be, and that it was left to the judgement's nature to find good or bad.","‘It’s impossible to mount a defence of oneself without a certain amount of good will,’ said Karl to himself, and didn’t reply to the Head Waiter, however much Therese might suffer as a result. He knew that whatever he said would look quite different in retrospect from the way he had meant it to sound, and that whether it was good or bad depended solely on the way it was judged.","“It’s impossible to defend oneself in the absence of goodwill,” Karl said to himself, and he ceased to answer the head waiter, however painful for Therese this might be. He knew that whatever he could say would end up seeming very different from the way it had been intended and that the way they assessed the matter was critical, since it alone would determine the final judgment of good or evil."
"Glücklicherweise zeigte sich bei dieser Gelegenheit, daß der Heizer schon viel in der Welt herumgekommen war. Musterhaf ruhig nahm er aus seinem Kofferchen mit dem ersten Griff ein Bündelchen Papiere sowie ein Notizbuch, gieng damit, als verstünde sich das von selbst, unter vollständiger Vernachlässigung des Ober- kassiers zum Kapitän und breitete auf dem Fensterbrett seine Beweismittel aus. Dem Oberkassier blieb nichts übrig als sich selbst hinzubemühn. „Der Mann ist ein bekannter Querulant"", sagte er zur Erklärung, „er ist mehr in der Kassa als im Maschinenraum. Er hat Schubal diesen ruhigen Menschen ganz zur Verzweiflung ge- bracht. Hören Sie einmal!"" wandte er sich an den Heizer, „Sie treiben Ihre Zudringlichkeit doch schon wirklich zu weit. Wie of hat man Sie schon aus den Auszahlungsräumen herausgeworfen, wie Sie es mit Ihren ganz, vollständig und ausnahmslos unberechtig- ten Forderungen verdienen! Wie of sind Sie von dort hierher in die Hauptkassa gelaufen gekommen! Wie of hat man Ihnen im Guten gesagt, daß Schubal Ihr unmittelbarer Vorgesetzter ist, mit dem allein Sie sich als sein Untergebener abzufinden haben! Und jetzt kommen Sie gar noch her, wenn der Herr Kapitän da ist, schämen sich nicht, sogar ihn zu belästigen, sondern entblöden sich nicht, als eingelernten Stimmführer Ihrer abgeschmackten Beschuldigungen diesen Kleinen mit- zubringen, den ich überhaupt zum erstenmal auf dem Schiffe sehe.""","Fortunately, this opportunity showed that the stoker had traveled a lot in the world. With exemplary calm he took a bundle of papers and a notebook from his suitcase with the first movement, went with them as if that were a matter of course, completely neglecting the chief cashier to the captain and spread out his evidence on the window sill. The head cashier had no choice but to try it himself. ""The man is a well-known troublemaker,"" he said in explanation, ""he's more in the till than in the machine room. He has driven this quiet man Schubal to despair. Listen!"" he turned to the stoker, “You really are taking your importunity too far. How often have you been thrown out of the payout rooms, as you deserve with your completely, completely and without exception unjustified claims! How often have you walked from there to the main cash desk! How often have you been told kindly that Schubal is your immediate superior, with whom you alone, as his subordinate, have to come to terms! And now come here, if the captain is there, don't be ashamed to bother even him, but don't be silly about bringing this little one with you as the trained leader of your absurd accusations, whom I've never seen on the ship for the first time .""","Happily, it became clear that the stoker was well versed in the ways of the world. With exemplary calmness he plucked from his little case a bundle of papers and a notebook, and, completely ignoring the chief cashier as though there was no question of doing anything else, went straight to the captain, and laid out his evidence on the window-sill. The chief cashier had no option but to join them there himself. ‘ That man is a well-known querulant,’ he explained. ‘ He spends more time in the office than in the engine-room. He has driven that easy going man Schubal to a state of despair. Listen, you!’ he turned to the stoker, ‘You’re really taking your importunity a stage too far. The number of times you’ve been thrown out of the accounts offices, quite rightly, with your completely and utterly, and with no exception, unjustified claims! The number of times you’ve come from there straight to the head office here! The number of times we’ve taken you aside and quietly reminded you that Schubal is your immediate superior, that you work to him and must deal directly with him! And now you barge in here in the presence of the captain himself, and you start pestering him, you’ve even had the neck to bring with you this well-rehearsed spokesman for your stale grudges, in the form of this little chap here, whom I’ve never even seen before.’","Fortunately, it soon became clear that the stoker was a man who had seen a great deal of the world. With exemplary composure he reached into his little suitcase and on his first attempt pulled out a little bundle of papers and a notebook, and then, as if this were the most obvious course of action, completely ignoring the chief bursar, he went over to the captain and spread out his evidence on the windowsill. The chief bursar had no alternative but to join them. “That fellow is a notorious crank,” he said by way of explanation, “he spends more time in the bursar’s office than in the machine room and has driven even Schubal, who’s such a calm man, to despair. Now listen to me once and for all!” he said, addressing the stoker, “you’ve been far too intrusive. How often have you been justifiably thrown out of the disbursement rooms for continually making such demands, which always turn out to be completely unreasonable! How often have you run over from those rooms to the main cash office! How often were you politely informed that Schubal is your immediate superior and that you, as his subordinate, must learn to live with him! And you even come in here when the captain is present; you’re not ashamed to disturb him and dare to bring along this little fellow, whom you’ve taught to reel off your fatuous accusations and whom I’m now seeing for the first time on board.”"
"Aber nicht lange, denn Klara kam eilends herein. Sichtlich bös rief sie: „Was soll denn das?"" und klatschte auf ihren Rock. Karl wollte erst antworten, bis sie höfli- cher war. Aber sie gieng mit großen Schritten auf ihn zu, rief: „Also wollen Sie mit mir kommen oder nicht?"" und stieß ihn mit Absicht oder bloß in der Erregung derartig an die Brust, daß er aus dem Fenster gestürzt wäre, hätte er nicht noch im letzten Augenblick vom Fensterbrett gleitend mit den Füßen den Zimmerboden berührt. Jetzt wäre ich bald herausgefallen"", sagte er vorwurfs- voll. „Schade daß es nicht geschehen ist. Warum sind Sie so unartig. Ich stoße Sie noch einmal hinunter."" Und wirklich umfaßte sie ihn und trug ihn, der verblüf sich zuerst schwer zu machen vergaß, mit ihrem vom Sport gestählten Körper fast bis zum Fenster. Aber dort be- sann er sich, machte sich mit einer Wendung der Hüfen los und umfaßte nun sie. „Ach Sie tun mir weh"", sagte sie gleich. Aber nun glaubte sie Karl nicht mehr loslassen zu dürfen. Er ließ ihr zwar Freiheit, Schritte nach Belie- ben zu machen, folgte ihr aber und ließ sie nicht los. Es war auch so leicht sie in ihrem engen Kleid zu umfassen. Lassen Sie mich"", flüsterte sie, das erhitzte Gesicht eng an seinem, er mußte sich anstrengen sie zu sehn, so nahe war sie ihm, „lassen Sie mich, ich werde Ihnen etwas Schönes geben."" „Warum seufzt sie so"", dachte Karl, es kann ihr nicht wehtun, ich drücke sie ja nicht"", und er ließ sie noch nicht los. Aber plötzlich nach einem Augenblick unachtsamen schweigenden Dastehns fühlte er wieder ihre wachsende Kraf an seinem Leib und sie hatte sich ihm entwunden, faßte ihn mit gut ausgenütz- tem Obergriff, wehrte seine Beine mit Fußstellungen ei- ner fremdartigen Kampfechnik ab und trieb ihn vor sich mit großartiger Regelmäßigkeit Athem holend gegen die Wand. Dort war aber ein Kanapee, auf das legte sie Karl hin und sagte, ohne sich allzusehr zu ihm hinabzubeu- gen: „Jetzt rühr Dich wenn Du kannst."" „Katze, tolle Katze"", konnte Karl gerade noch aus dem Durcheinan- der von Wut und Scham rufen, in dem er sich befand. „Du bist ja wahnsinnig, Du tolle Katze."" „Gib acht auf Deine Worte"", sagte sie und ließ die eine Hand zu sei- nem Halse gleiten, den sie so stark zu würgen anfieng, daß Karl ganz unfähig war, etwas anderes zu tun, als Luf zu schnappen, während sie mit der andern Hand an seine Wange fuhr, wie probeweise sie berührte, sie wie- der undzwar immer weiter in die Luf zurückzog und jeden Augenblick mit einer Ohrfeige niederfahren lassen konnte. „Wie wäre es"", fragte sie dabei, „wenn ich Dich zur Strafe für Dein Benehmen einer Dame gegenüber mit einer tüchtigen Ohrfeige nachhause schicken wollte. Vielleicht wäre es Dir nützlich für Deinen künfigen Le- bensweg, wenn es auch keine schone Erinnerung abge- ben würde. Du tust mir ja leid und bist ein erträglich hübscher Junge und hättest Du Jiu-Jitsu gelernt, hättest Du wahrscheinlich mich durchgeprügelt. Trotzdem, trotzdem – es verlockt mich geradezu riesig Dich zu ohrfeigen so wie Du jetzt daliegst. Ich werde es wahr- scheinlich bedauern, wenn ich es aber tun sollte, so wisse schon jetzt, daß ich es fast gegen meinen Willen tun werde. Und ich werde mich dann natürlich nicht mit einer Ohrfeige begnügen, sondern rechts und links schlagen, bis Dir die Backen anschwellen. Und vielleicht bist Du ein Ehrenmann – ich möchte es fast glauben – und wirst mit den Ohrfeigen nicht weiterleben wollen und Dich aus der Welt schaffen. Aber warum bist Du auch so gegen mich gewesen. Gefalle ich Dir vielleicht nicht? Lohnt es sich nicht auf mein Zimmer zu kom- men? Achtung! jetzt hätte ich Dir schon fast unverse- hens die Ohrfeige aufgepelzt. Wenn Du heute also noch so loskommen solltest, benimm Dich nächstens feiner. Ich bin nicht Dein Onkel, mit dem Du trotzen kannst. Im übrigen will ich Dich noch darauf aufmerksam ma- chen, daß wenn ich Dich ungeohrfeigt loslasse Du nicht glauben mußt, daß Deine jetzige Lage und wirkliches Geohrfeigtwerden vom Standpunkt der Ehre aus das Gleiche sind, solltest Du das glauben wollen, so würde ich es doch vorziehn, Dich wirklich zu ohrfeigen. Was wohl Mack sagen wird, wenn ich ihm das alles erzähle."" Bei der Erinnerung an Mack ließ sie Karl los, in seinen undeutlichen Gedanken erschien ihm Mack wie ein Be- freier. Er fühlte noch ein Weilchen Klaras Hand an sei- nem Hals, wand sich daher noch ein wenig und lag dann still.","But not for long, because Klara came in in a hurry. She cried out visibly angrily: ""What's that supposed to mean?"" and slapped her skirt. Karl first wanted to answer until she was more polite not?"" and, either intentionally or just out of excitement, pushed him so hard on the chest that he would have fallen out of the window if he hadn't slipped off the window sill and touched the floor with his feet at the last moment. ""It's a pity it didn't happen. Why are you being so naughty? I'll push you down again."" And she really did embrace him and carry him, who, amazed at first, forgot to make himself difficult, with her sport-hardened body almost to the window. But there he changed his mind, freed himself with a turn of his hips and now embraced her. ""Oh, you're hurting me,"" she said right away. But now she felt she couldn't let go of Karl anymore. He gave her freedom to take any steps he wanted, but he followed her and didn't let her go. It was like that, too lightly to hold her in her tight dress. Let me,"" she whispered, her flushed face close to his, he had to strain to see her, she was so close to him, ""let me, I'll give you something nice. ""Why is she sighing like that,"" thought Karl, it can't hurt her, I'm not squeezing her, and he didn't let go of her yet. But suddenly, after a moment of carelessly standing there in silence, he felt her growing strength on his body again and she had wriggled out of him, seized him with a well-used overhand grip, fended off his legs with foot stances in some strange fighting technique, and drove him in front of her, gasping for breath, against the wall with great regularity. But there was a sofa there, and she laid it on Karl and said without looking al Leaning down too much: ""Now move if you can."" ""Cat, great cat,"" Karl was just able to call out from the confusion of anger and shame in which he found himself. ""You're crazy, you great cat."" ""Be careful what you say,"" she said, sliding one hand to his throat, which she began to choke so hard that Karl was unable to do anything but gasp for air while she was struggling with the other hand touched his cheek, as if touching it, pulling it back further and further into the air and being able to slap it down at any moment Wanted to send your behavior towards a lady home with a good slap in the face. Perhaps it would be useful for your future life, even if it weren't a pleasant memory. I feel sorry for you and you're a tolerably handsome boy and if you had learned jiu-jitsu you probably would have beaten me up. Nevertheless, nevertheless - it tempts me almost enormously to slap you as you lie there now. I will probably regret it, but if I should do it, know now that I will do it almost against my will. And of course I won't be satisfied with a slap in the face, but will smack you right and left until your cheeks swell. And maybe you're a man of honor - I almost want to believe it - and you won't want to live with the slaps on your face and you'll get rid of the world. But why were you so against me? Maybe you don't like me? Isn't it worth coming to my room? Danger! now I almost inadvertently slapped you in the face. So if you should still get away with it today, behave better next time. I'm not your uncle to brag with. Besides, I want to draw your attention to the fact that if I let you go without being slapped, you don't have to believe that your current situation and actually being slapped are the same from the point of view of honor; if you wanted to believe that, I would prefer to really slap you. What will Mack say if I tell him all this."" When she remembered Mack, Karl let her go, in his vague thoughts Mack seemed like a liberator. He felt Klara's hand on his neck for a while longer. therefore squirmed a little and then lay still.","But not for long, because Klara ran in. Clearly angry, she cried: ‘What do you think you’re playing at?’ and smacked at her skirt Karl wasn’t going to answer until she changed her tone. But she strode up to him and cried: ‘Well, are you coming or not?’ and either intentionally or in her excitement, she shoved him in the chest, so that he would have fallen out of the window, if his feet hadn’t gripped the floor at the last moment as he slipped backwards off the window-seat. I almost fell out of the window just now,’ he said, reprovingly. ‘Well, I wish you had. Why are you so naughty. I’m going to push you down again.’ And she put her arms round him, he was so surprised he forgot to make himself heavy, and with her sport-toughened body she carried him almost as far as the window. Then he came to his senses, freed himself with a twist of his hips, and then grabbed her. ‘ Oh stop it, you’re hurting me!’ she said right away. But this time Karl thought he’d better not let her go. He allowed her to move her feet and take steps, but he went with her and didn’t let go. It was so easy to hold on to her in her tight dress. ‘ Let me go,’ she whispered, her flushed face just by his, he had to strain to see her , she was so close, ‘Let me go, and I’ll give you a present.’ ‘Why is she sighing like that,’ thought Karl, ‘it can’t be hurting her, I’m not pressing at all,’ and he didn’t let go. But suddenly after a moment of careless silent standing, his body felt her strength returning and she slipped free, and held his upper body in a practised grip, warding off his legs with foot movements of some exotic fighting style, and panting for air with wonderful regularity, she drove him back towards the wall. There was a sofa there, on which she laid Karl, and said to him, ‘Now try and escape.’ ‘You cat, you wildcat,’ Karl cried in a bewilderment of shame and rage. ‘You wildcat, you’re mad.’ ‘Watch your words,’ she said, and one of her hands slipped round his throat and began choking him so hard that Karl was reduced to gulping for air, while with the other hand she touched his cheek as though to try it out, and then withdrew it far enough for her to slap him at any moment. ‘How would you like it,’ she said, ‘if for your behaviour towards a lady I were to send you home with a good slap for punishment. Perhaps it would be a useful lesson for future reference, though it wouldn’t be a pleasant memory. I’m sorry for you, you’re quite a good-looking boy really, and if you’d learned ju-jitsu, you would probably have given me a thrashing. Even so, even so – seeing you lying there, I feel an enormous urge to smack your face. I’ll probably regret it, but if I do it, I want you to know that it will almost have been in spite of myself. And of course I wouldn’t content myself with just one slap then, but hit you left and right till your cheeks are swollen. Maybe you’re a man of honour – I almost think you are – and you won’t be able to go on living after you’ve been slapped, and you’ll have to do away with yourself. But why did you have to treat me like that? Don’t you like me? Didn’t you want to come up to my room with me? Woops! I almost slapped you by accident. But if I let you off for now, you’d better behave in future. I’m not your uncle whom you can defy with impunity. Lastly I want to point out to you that if I let you go without slapping you, you’re not to think that in point of honour you might as well have been slapped, because if you were to think that, I’d prefer actually to slap you. I wonder what Mack will say when I tell him all this.’ At the name of Mack she let go of Karl, to whose confused mind Mack seemed like a saviour. He could still feel Klarl’s hand round his throat, so he went on writhing for a while and then lay still.","But not for long, since Klara came hurrying in. Visibly annoyed, she cried: “What’s this?” and slapped her skirt. Before answering, Karl wanted to wait until she became more polite. But she approached him, taking large steps, and cried: “Well, are you coming or not?”; then, whether by design or simply out of excitement, she pushed his chest so forcefully that he would have fallen out the window had he not slipped from the windowsill and had his feet not at the last minute touched the floor. “I was about to fall out,” he said reproachfully. “It’s a pity you didn’t. Why are you so bad? I’ll push you back down.” With a body steeled by athletics, she seized Karl, who was so bewildered that for a moment he forgot to go limp, and carried him to the window. But on approaching the window he came to his senses, freed himself by swiveling his hips around quickly, and then in turn seized her. “Oh, you’re hurting me,” she said at once. Karl, however, thought that he should not release her now. He gave her sufficient freedom to move at will but kept following her about and did not release her. Besides, it was so easy to get an arm around her in that tight dress. “Let me go,” she whispered; her flushed face was now beside his, indeed so close that he had to strain his eyes to look at her. “Let me go, I’ll give you something wonderful.” Why does she have to sob like that , Karl thought, it can’t be hurting her, I’m certainly not squeezing her, and he did not release her. But then all of a sudden he felt her steadily increasing strength press against his body, and after quickly extricating herself, she caught him in a skillful tackle, warded off his legs with footwork from some unfamiliar wrestling technique, and drove him toward the wall while still taking splendidly even breaths. By the wall, however, was a settee, where she deposited Karl; then, bending down only slightly toward him, she said: “Now see if you can move.” “You cat, you wild cat,” Karl could barely cry out amid the muddle of anger and shame besetting him. “You’re truly insane, you wild cat.” “Watch what you say,” she said, and slid one hand over his throat, then began to squeeze it so tightly that Karl could only gasp for air; she drew the other hand across his cheek, first touching it, and then withdrew her hand and raised it ever higher in the air, ready to let it fall at any moment with a great slap. “What would you say,” she asked, “if as punishment for treating a lady like this, you got a good slap in the face to take home with you? While it might be useful to you as you go through life, it wouldn’t exactly leave you with fond memories. I do feel sorry for you—you’re a tolerably handsome youth, and if you’d learned some jujitsu, you’d probably have beaten me up. But still—just seeing you lying there like that makes me hugely tempted to slap you in the face. I shall probably regret it; but if I do go ahead, mark my words, I’ll be doing so almost against my will. And then of course I won’t stop at one slap but shall go on hitting you left and right until your cheeks start swelling. And perhaps you are indeed a man of honor—I should almost like to think so—and after being slapped you simply won’t want to go on living and will do away with yourself. But why were you so hostile toward me? Perhaps you don’t like me? You think it’s not worth your while to come to my room? Watch out! All of a sudden I almost let you have it. If you get off scot-free today, though, make sure you behave more decently next time around. After all, I’m not your uncle, whom you can evidently treat very brazenly. Besides, I’d like you to know that even if I let you off without a single slap, you shouldn’t imagine that so far as your honor is concerned, this is quite the same thing as actually getting slapped; if that is what you really thought, I should prefer to give you an actual slapping. Goodness knows what Mack will say when I describe all this to him.” Remembering Mack, she released Karl, in whose indistinct thoughts Mack appeared as a rescuer. Still feeling the pressure of Klara’s hand on his throat, he wriggled about a little, then lay still."
"Kurz darauf hatte er eine womöglich noch unangeneh- mere Begegnung. Es machte sich nämlich an ihn ein Mann heran, der einen Wagen mit großen Milchkannen vor sich herschob und äußerst gern erfahren hätte, was unter dem grauen Tuch auf Karls Wagen lag. Es war nicht anzunehmen, daß er den gleichen Weg wie Karl hatte, dennoch aber blieb er ihm zur Seite, so überra- schende Wendungen Karl auch machte. Zuerst begnügte er sich mit Ausrufen, wie z. B. „Du mußt eine schwere Last haben"" oder „Du hast schlecht aufgeladen, oben wird etwas herausfallen."" Später aber fragte er geradezu: Was hast Du denn unter dem Tuch?"" Karl sagte: „Was kümmert's Dich?"" Aber da das den Mann noch neugie- riger machte, sagte Karl schließlich: „Es sind Äpfel."" So viel Äpfel"", sagte der Mann staunend und hörte nicht auf, diesen Ausruf zu wiederholen. „Das ist ja eine ganze Ernte"", sagte er dann. „Nun ja"", sagte Karl. Aber sei es daß er Karl nicht glaubte, sei es daß er ihn ärgern wollte, er gieng noch weiter, begann – alles während der Fahrt – die Hand wie zum Scherz nach dem Tuch auszu- strecken und wagte es endlich sogar an dem Tuch zu zupfen. Was mußte Brunelda leiden! Aus Rücksicht auf sie wollte sich Karl in keinen Streit mit dem Mann ein- lassen und fuhr in das nächste offene Tor ein, als sei dies sein Ziel gewesen. „Hier bin ich zuhause"", sagte er, Dank für die Begleitung."" Der Mann blieb erstaunt vor dem Tor stehn und sah Karl nach, der ruhig darangieng wenn es sein mußte den ganzen ersten Hof zu durchque- ren. Der Mann konnte nicht mehr zweifeln, aber um seiner Bosheit ein letztes Mal zu genügen, ließ er seinen Wagen stehn, lief Karl auf den Fußspitzen nach und riß so stark an dem Tuch, daß er Bruneldas Gesicht fast entblößt hätte. „Damit Deine Äpfel Luf bekommen"", sagte er und lief zurück. Auch das nahm Karl noch hin, da es ihn endgültig von dem Mann befreite. Er führte dann den Wagen in einen Hofwinkel, wo einige große leere Kisten standen in deren Schutz er unter dem Tuch Brunelda einige beruhigende Worte sagen wollte. Aber er mußte lange auf sie einreden, denn sie war ganz in Tränen und flehte ihn allen Ernstes an, hier hinter den Kisten den ganzen Tag zu bleiben und erst in der Nacht weiterzufahren. Vielleicht hätte er allein sie gar nicht davon überzeugen können, wie verfehlt das gewesen wä- re, als aber jemand am andern Ende des Kistenhaufens eine leere Kiste unter ungeheuerem im leeren Hof wie- derhallenden Lärm zu Boden warf, erschrak sie so, daß sie ohne ein Wort mehr zu wagen, das Tuch über sich zog und wahrscheinlich glückselig war, als Karl kurz entschlossen sofort zu fahren begann.","Shortly thereafter, he had what was perhaps an even more unpleasant encounter. A man approached him who was pushing a wagon with large milk churns in front of him and would very much like to know what lay under the gray cloth on Karl's wagon. It was not to be assumed that he followed the same path as Karl, but he nevertheless stayed by his side, however surprising turns Karl made. At first he contented himself with exclamations such as: B. ""You must have a heavy load"" or ""You have loaded badly, something will fall out at the top."" But later he asked straight out: What do you have under the cloth?"" Karl said: ""What do you care?"" But since that made the man even more curious, Karl finally said: ""They are apples."" So many apples,"" the man said in amazement and didn't stop repeating this exclamation. ""That's quite a harvest,"" he then said. ""Well yes,"" said Karl. But whether he didn't believe Karl, or whether he wanted to annoy him, he went further, began - all while driving - to stretch out his hand as if in jest for the cloth and finally even dared to pluck at the cloth . What Brunelda had to suffer! Out of consideration for her, Karl didn't want to get into a fight with the man and drove into the nearest open gate as if this had been his goal. ""This is my home,"" he said, thanks for the company."" The man stood in amazement in front of the gate and looked after Karl, who calmly started to cross the whole first courtyard if he had to. The man could no longer doubt, but to satisfy his malice one last time, he left his car standing, Karl ran after him on tiptoe and tugged at the cloth so hard that he almost uncovered Brunelda's face. ""So that your apples can get some air,"" he said and ran back. Karl accepted that, too, because it finally freed him from the man. He then drove the car into a corner of the courtyard, where some large empty crates stood under their protection Brunelda wanted to say a few soothing words to the cloth. But he had to talk to her for a long time, because she was in tears and begged him in all seriousness to stay here behind the crates all day and only drive on at night. Perhaps he could have been alone She couldn't convince her how foolish that would have been, but when someone at the other end of the pile of boxes threw an empty box on the ground to a tremendous noise that echoed in the empty yard, she was so startled that she closed without a word dare, pulled the cloth over himself and was probably blissful when Karl decided to start driving immediately.","Shortly afterwards he had a possibly even more disagreeable encounter. A man approached him, pushing a handcart full of milk churns, and obviously burning to know what was under the grey cloth on Karl’s cart. It was hardly possible that he had exactly the same route as Karl, but he stuck to his side, whatever surprising turns Karl made. At first he contented himself with exclamations, such as: ‘That looks like a heavy load’ or ‘Your load looks badly balanced, something’s about to fall off the top.’ Then, later, he put direct questions: ‘What have you got under that cloth?’ Karl replied: ‘What’s it to you?’ But as that only made the man still more curious, Karl finally said: ‘Apples.’ ‘What a lot of apples,’ said the man in amazement, and he repeated it a few times yet. ‘ That’s a whole apple harvest,’ he said. ‘That’s right,’ said Karl. But, either because he didn’t believe Karl, or because he wanted to annoy him, he went further, he started – all the while they were moving – reaching out playfully for the cloth, and finally went so far as to tug at it. How Brunelda must be suffering! Out of consideration for her, Karl wanted to avoid an argument with the man, and he turned abruptly into the next open gate, as though that were his destination. ‘Here we are,’ he said, ‘thanks for your company.’ The man stopped in amazement in front of the gate, and watched Karl calmly going in, prepared if need be, to cross the whole of the first courtyard. Surely the man could be in no more doubt, but to satisfy his wickedness one more time, he left his wagon standing, tiptoed after Karl and tugged so hard on the cloth that he almost bared Brunelda’s face. ‘Your apples need to breathe,’ he said, and off he ran. Even that Karl put up with, since it finally rid him of the man. He pulled the cart into a corner of the courtyard, where there were some large empty crates, in the lee of which he wanted to say some comforting words to Brunelda under her cloth. But he had to talk to her a long time, because she was in tears, and quite seriously beseeched him to let her stay behind the crates all day, and only go on at night. He might not have been able to convince her how mistaken that would have been on his own, but when someone at the other end of the pile of crates hurled an empty crate on to the ground, so that it made a dreadful noise that echoed round the empty courtyard, she was so terrified that, without another word, she pulled the cloth back over her again, and was probably delighted when Karl quickly got moving again.","Shortly afterward he experienced what was possibly an even more unpleasant encounter. For approaching him was a man, pushing a cart laden with large milk cans, who was extremely eager to learn what lay beneath the gray cloth on Karl’s cart. Although it was unlikely that he was heading in the same direction as Karl, he stayed beside him in spite of the unpredictable turns Karl would suddenly take. At first he settled for remarks such as “You must be carrying a heavy load” or “You didn’t load the cart properly; something up on top is bound to fall off.” Then he asked bluntly: “What are you carrying under that cloth?” Karl said: “What concern is it of yours?” But since this only made the man all the more curious, Karl finally said: “Apples.” “You have so many apples,” the man said in astonishment, repeating the remark over and over again. “That’s an entire harvest,” he said. “Well, yes,” said Karl. But whether he did not believe Karl or whether he wanted to annoy him, he carried this even further, and—all without breaking his stride—began to reach out his hand toward the cloth, as if in jest, and finally he even had the audacity to tug at the cloth. The things Brunelda had to endure! Out of consideration for her, Karl did not want to get into a fight with the man and therefore entered through the next open gate, as though that were his destination. “This is where I live,” he said. “Thanks for the company.” The man remained at the gate, looking in astonishment at Karl, who was prepared to walk all the way across the first courtyard. The man could no longer be in any doubt as to Karl’s intentions, but in order to satisfy his malice one last time, he left his cart, pursued Karl on tiptoes, and gave the cloth such a sharp tug that he almost exposed Brunelda’s face. “Just to give your apples a little air,” he said, and ran off. Karl swallowed even that insult, for it would free him from that man at last. Then he guided the cart into a corner of the yard where several boxes afforded some privacy and where he could say a few soothing words to Brunelda. But he had to spend a great deal of time cajoling her, since she wept a great deal and implored him in all seriousness that they should stay behind the boxes all day and not set off again until nightfall. Perhaps he alone could not have convinced her how misguided that would have been, but when someone at the far end of the pile threw an empty box to the ground, making a resounding noise in the empty courtyard, she was so startled that, without even daring to say another word, she pulled the cloth up over herself and was probably more than happy when Karl resolved to set off right away."
"„Aber wann schlafen Sie?"" fragte Karl und sah den Studenten verwundert an.","""But when do you sleep?"" asked Karl and looked at the student in amazement.","‘So when do you sleep?’ asked Karl, and looked at the student in astonishment.","“When do you sleep, though?” asked Karl, looking at the student in amazement."
"„Es hat ihm nicht geschadet!"" wiederholte laut la- chend der Senator.","""It did him no harm!"" repeated the senator, laughing out loud.","‘It did him no harm!’ repeated the Senator, with a loud laugh.","“It did him no harm!” the senator repeated, laughing very loudly."
"In den Anblick Giacomos verloren, blieb aber Karl allzulange von seinem Platze fort, eben wollte er zu- rückkehren, da kam der Personalchef, stellte sich auf eine der höher gelegenen Bänke, klatschte in die Hände und hielt eine kleine Ansprache, während die meisten aufstanden und die Sitzengebliebenen die sich nicht vom Essen trennen konnten, durch Stöße der andern schließ- lich auch zum Aufstehn gezwungen wurden. „Ich will hoffen"", sagte er, Karl war inzwischen schon auf den Fußspitzen zu seinem Platz zurückgelaufen, „daß Sie mit unserm Empfangsessen zufrieden waren. Im allge- meinen lobt man das Essen unserer Werbetruppe. Leider muß ich die Tafel bereits aufeben, denn der Zug, der Sie nach Oklahama bringen soll, fährt in fünf Minuten. Es ist zwar eine lange Reise, Sie werden aber sehn, daß für Sie gut gesorgt ist. Hier stelle ich Ihnen den Herrn vor, der Ihren Transport führen wird und dem Sie Gehorsam schulden."" Ein magerer kleiner Herr erkletterte die Bank auf welcher der Personalchef stand, nahm sich kaum Zeit eine flüchtige Verbeugung zu machen, son- dern begann sofort mit ausgestreckten nervösen Händen zu zeigen, wie sich alle sammeln, ordnen und in Bewe- gung setzen sollten. Aber zunächst folgte man ihm nicht, denn derjenige aus der Gesellschaf der schon frü- her eine Rede gehalten hatte, schlug mit der Hand auf den Tisch und begann eine längere Dankrede, trotzdem – Karl wurde ganz unruhig – eben gesagt worden war, daß der Zug bald abfahre. Aber der Redner achtete nicht einmal darauf, daß auch der Personalchef nicht zuhörte sondern dem Transportleiter verschiedene Anweisungen gab, er legte seine Rede groß an, zählte alle Gerichte auf, die aufgetragen worden waren, gab über jedes sein Urteil ab und schloß dann zusammenfassend mit dem Ausruf: „Geehrte Herren, so gewinnt man uns."" Alle außer den Angesprochenen lachten, aber es war doch mehr Wahr- heit als Scherz.","Lost in the sight of Giacomo, Karl stayed away from his place for too long. He was just about to return when the head of personnel came, stood on one of the higher benches, clapped his hands and made a short speech while most of them stood up and those who remained seated, who could not part with their food, were finally forced to stand up by being pushed by the others. ""I hope,"" he said, Karl had meanwhile tiptoed back to his seat, ""that you were satisfied with our reception meal. In general, people praise the food served by our recruiting troupe the train that is to take you to Oklahama leaves in five minutes. It is a long journey, but you will find that you are well taken care of. Here I introduce the gentleman who will be in charge of your transport, and to whom you owe obedience."" A skinny little gentleman scrambled onto the bench on which the personnel manager was standing, hardly taking time to make a cursory bow, but immediately began, with outstretched nervous hands, showing how everyone should gather, arrange and move. But at first no one followed him, because the person from the company who had already made a speech earlier slammed his hand on the table and began a lengthy speech of thanks, although - Karl became very restless - it had just been said that the train leaving soon. But the speaker didn't even pay attention to the fact that the chief of staff wasn't listening either, but gave the head of transport various instructions, he laid out his speech big, listed all the dishes that had been ordered, gave his verdict on each one and then summed up with the Exclamation: ""Dear gentlemen, that's how you win us over."" Everyone laughed except for the one spoken to, but it was more truth than joke.","Lost looking at Giacomo, Karl had stayed away from his place far too long , he was just about to go back to it, when the head of personnel came along, stood on one of the higher benches, clapped his hands, and gave a little speech, for which the majority stood, and those who remained seated, unable to tear themselves away from their food, were finally compelled to stand too by nudges from the others. ‘I hope’, he said, Karl had tiptoed back to his place, ‘you were happy with your welcome dinner. In general, the food for our publicity team is held in high regard. Unfortunately I have to bring the meal to a speedy conclusion, because the train that will take you to Oklahoma is leaving in five minutes. It’s a long journey, but as you’ll see, you will be well looked after. Let me present to you the gentleman who will be responsible for transporting you, and whom you must obey.’ A skinny little gentleman clambered up on to the same bench as the head of personnel, barely found time for a perfunctory bow, but began right away by indicating with gestures of his nervous hands how he wanted everyone to assemble, get in line and start moving. But for a time no one did any of this, because the same individual who had proposed a toast earlier now banged on the table with his hand and embarked on a lengthy vote of thanks, even though – Karl was getting quite agitated – it had just been announced that their train would be leaving shortly. But the speaker, not even seeming to care that the head of personnel wasn’t listening, he was giving the transport organizer some instructions, was now well into his speech, he listed all the dishes that had been served, gave his verdicts on each of them, and concluded with the cry: ‘And that, gentleman, is the way to our hearts.’ Everyone laughed, except those he had addressed, but there was more truth than humour in his remarks.","Lost in contemplation of Giacomo, Karl remained away from his seat too long, and just as he was about to go back, the personnel manager came, climbed onto one of the higher benches, clapped his hands, and gave a brief speech; most people rose, prompting those who were still seated and could not tear themselves away from their food to do likewise. “Well,” he said—Karl had already tiptoed quickly back to his seat—“I do hope you were satisfied with our welcome dinner. People generally do praise the food served by our recruiting troupe. Unfortunately I must break up this gathering, though, since the train meant to take you to Oklahama will be leaving in five minutes. It’s a long trip, but as you’ll see, you’ll be well taken care of. And now I should like to introduce you to the gentleman who will be in charge of your transportation and whose orders you should follow.” A small, thin gentleman climbed onto the bench beside the personnel manager, barely took the time to give a hasty bow, and stretching out his trembling hands, quickly began to show everyone how to assemble, get into line and start moving. But they did not comply right away, since the person in their group who had earlier on given the speech slammed his hand on the table and began to deliver a rather lengthy thank-you speech despite the recent announcement that the train was about to leave—and Karl became very uneasy. Completely ignoring the fact that he no longer had the ear of the personnel manager, who was giving various instructions to the transportation manager, the speaker embarked on a lengthy speech listing all of the courses that had been served, pronouncing judgment on each, and concluding with the cry: “Honorable gentlemen, this is certainly the way to win us over.” Everyone—except those he was addressing—laughed, although there was more truth than jest in what he said."
"Verhältnismäßig lange dauerte es, ehe sich der Onkel entschloß, Karl auch nur einen kleinen Einblick in sein Geschäf zu erlauben, trotzdem Karl öfers darum er- sucht hatte. Es war eine Art Kommissions- und Spedi- tionsgeschäfes, wie sie, soweit sich Karl erinnern konn- te, in Europa vielleicht gar nicht zu finden war. Das Geschäf bestand nämlich in einem Zwischenhandel, der aber die Waren nicht etwa von den Producenten zu den Konsumenten oder vielleicht zu den Händlern vermit- telte, sondern welcher die Vermittlung aller Waren und Urprodukte für die großen Fabrikskartelle und zwi- schen ihnen besorgte. Es war daher ein Geschäf, wel- ches in einem Käufe, Lagerungen, Transporte und Ver- käufe riesenhafen Umfangs umfaßte und ganz genaue unauförliche telephonische und telegraphische Verbin- dungen mit den Klienten unterhalten mußte. Der Saal der Telegraphen war nicht kleiner, sondern größer als das Telegraphenamt der Vaterstadt, durch das Karl ein- mal an der Hand eines dort bekannten Mitschülers ge- gangen war. Im Saal der Telephone giengen wohin man schaute die Türen der Telephonzellen auf und zu und das Läuten war sinnverwirrend. Der Onkel öffnete die nächste dieser Türen und man sah dort im sprühenden elektrischen Licht einen Angestellten gleichgültig gegen jedes Geräusch der Türe, den Kopf eingespannt in ein Stahlband, das ihm die Hörmuscheln an die Ohren drückte. Der rechte Arm lag auf einem Tischchen, als wäre er besonders schwer und nur die Finger, welche den Bleistif hielten, zuckten unmenschlich gleichmäßig und rasch. In den Worten, die er in den Sprechtrichter sagte, war er sehr sparsam und of sah man sogar, daß er vielleicht gegen den Sprecher etwas einzuwenden hatte, ihn etwas genauer fragen wollte, aber gewisse Worte, die er hörte zwangen ihn, ehe er seine Absicht ausführen konnte, die Augen zu senken und zu schreiben. Er muß- te auch nicht reden, wie der Onkel Karl leise erklärte, denn die gleichen Meldungen, wie sie dieser Mann auf- nahm, wurden noch von zwei andern Angestellten gleichzeitig aufgenommen und dann verglichen, so daß Irrtümer möglichst ausgeschlossen waren. In dem glei- chen Augenblick als der Onkel und Karl aus der Tür getreten waren, schlüpfe ein Praktikant hinein und kam mit dem inzwischen beschriebenen Papier heraus. Mit- ten durch den Saal war ein beständiger Verkehr von hin und her gejagten Leuten. Keiner grüßte, das Grüßen war abgeschaf, jeder schloß sich den Schritten des ihm vor- hergehenden an und sah auf den Boden auf dem er mög- lichst rasch vorwärtskommen wollte oder fieng mit den Blicken wohl nur einzelne Worte oder Zahlen von Pa- pieren ab, die er in der Hand hielt und die bei seinem Laufschritt flatterten.","It took a relatively long time before the uncle decided to allow Karl even a small insight into his business, even though Karl öfers had asked for it. It was a kind of consignment and forwarding business that, as far as Karl could remember, might not have been found anywhere in Europe. The business consisted in an intermediate trade, which, however, did not mediate the goods from the producers to the consumers or perhaps to the dealers, but which took care of the mediation of all goods and primary products for the large factory cartels and between them. It was, therefore, a business which involved buying, storing, transporting and selling in one gigantic volume, and which had to maintain very precise, constant telephone and telegraphic communications with the clients. The room with the telegraphs was not smaller, but larger than the telegraph office in his hometown, through which Karl had once walked with the hand of a classmate he knew there. In the telephone hall, wherever you looked, the doors of the telephone booths opened and closed, and the ringing was confusing. The uncle opened the nearest of these doors and there, in the sparkling electric light, one saw a clerk indifferent to every sound of the door, his head clamped in a steel band that clamped the earpieces to his ears. The right arm lay on a small table as if it were particularly heavy and only the fingers holding the pencil twitched inhumanly evenly and quickly. In the words he said into the funnel he was very economical, and one could even see that he perhaps had something to object to the speaker, wanted to ask him something more specific, but certain words he heard compelled him before he could say his intention to lower his eyes and write. He didn't have to talk either, as Uncle Karl explained quietly, because the same reports that this man was taking were being taken down by two other employees at the same time and then compared, so that errors were ruled out as far as possible. The moment Uncle and Karl stepped out of the door, an intern slipped in and came out with the paper that had been written on in the meantime. Through the middle of the hall was a constant traffic of people being chased to and fro. No one greeted, greetings were a thing of the past, everyone followed the steps of the previous one and looked at the ground on which they wanted to move forward as quickly as possible, or perhaps only caught individual words or numbers on paper with their eyes, which he held in his hand and which fluttered as he ran.","It took rather a long time before his uncle decided to give Karl any insight at all into the nature of his business, though Karl often asked him about it. It was a sort of commissioning and forwarding business, of a kind that Karl thought probably didn’t even exist in Europe. The actual business consisted of intermediate trade, but not delivering goods from producers to consumers or even to retailers, but the supplying of goods and raw materials to the great factory cartels, and from one cartel to another. It involved buying, storing, transporting and selling on a vast scale, demanding constant telephone and telegraph communications with its customers. The telegraph room was not smaller but actually larger than the telegraph office of his home town, through which Karl had once walked guided by a fellow pupil who knew his way around it. And wherever one looked in the telephone room, the doors of telephone booths were continually opening and closing, and the sound of so many telephones ringing was quite bewildering. The uncle opened the door of the nearest booth, and in the fizzing electric light sat an employee, quite indifferent to the sound of the door, his head gripped by a steel band that clamped the headphones to his ears. His right arm lay on a little table, as though it was particularly heavy, and only the fingers holding a pencil moved with inhuman speed and fluency. He spoke very sparingly into the tube and one often saw that he wanted to make some objection to the speaker, or to ask him some question, but certain words he heard forced him instead, before he could say anything, to lower his eyes and write. It wasn’t his job to talk, as the uncle quietly explained to Karl, because the information that he was gathering was also simultaneously being taken down by two other employees and then collated, so that errors were as far as possible eliminated. Just as Karl and his uncle were stepping out of the door, an apprentice slipped in and emerged with the completed message on a piece of paper. People were criss-crossing the middle of the floor, in all directions, at great speed. No one offered a greeting, greetings had been abolished, each one fell into the tracks of the man ahead of him and kept his eyes on the floor, across which he wanted to make as rapid progress as possible, or else he picked up, at a glance, single words or figures from the fluttering piece of paper he held in his hand.","It took a relatively long time for his uncle to decide to permit Karl even a quick look at his business, even though Karl had often requested one. It was a kind of consignment and shipping business, the likes of which—so far as Karl could recall—could perhaps not be found in Europe. The business involved intermediary trading, which rather than, say, conveying goods from producers to consumers or perhaps to merchants, handled the distribution of all goods and components and their transport to and fro between the large manufacturing cartels. So it was a business that not only encompassed the purchase, storage, transport and sale of goods on a massive scale but also had to maintain the most precise and uninterrupted telephone and telegraph connections with its clients. The telegraph hall was no smaller, in fact even larger, than the telegraph office in his native city, which Karl had once walked through arm in arm with a fellow pupil who was known there. Wherever one looked in the telephone room, the doors of the telephone cells were constantly opening and closing, and the ringing was stupefying. His uncle opened the nearest door, and in the spark ling electric light one could see an employee, oblivious to all the noise coming from the door, with his head tucked into a steel band that pressed the earpieces up against his ears. His right arm lay on a small table as if it were a heavy burden, and only the fingers holding a pencil twitched at a rapid and inhumanly regular pace. He spoke into the mouthpiece sparingly, and often one could even see that he wanted to object to something the speaker had said, but before he could do so, he heard further utterances that compelled him to lower his eyes and write. Besides, there was no need for him to speak, as Karl’s uncle explained in a low voice, for the same reports transcribed by this man were also transcribed by two other employees, then compared with one another, so that all errors could be eliminated insofar as possible. Just as the uncle and Karl were stepping out of the doorway, a trainee slipped in and emerged again holding a sheet of paper that already had writing on it. There was constant movement; people ran back and forth in the hall. No one said hello, such greetings having been dispensed with; each person followed in the steps of the person before him, either looking at the floor, which he wanted to cross as quickly as possible, or glancing at the papers in his hands and probably managing to catch only isolated words or numbers from the papers fluttering in his hand, as he ran along."
"Eines Tages kam der Onkel knapp vor der Zeit des Essens, das Karl wie gewöhnlich allein einzunehmen ge- dachte und forderte ihn auf, sich gleich schwarz anzu- ziehn und mit ihm zum Essen zu kommen, an welchem zwei Geschäfsfreunde teilnehmen würden. Während Karl sich im Nebenzimmer umkleidete, setzte sich der Onkel zum Schreibtisch und sah die gerade beendete Englischaufgabe durch, schlug mit der Hand auf den Tisch und rief laut: „Wirklich ausgezeichnet!"" Zweifel- los gelang das Anziehen besser, als Karl dieses Lob hör- te, aber er war auch wirklich seines Englischen schon ziemlich sicher.","One day, just before the time for dinner, which Karl, as usual, intended to eat alone, the uncle asked him to dress in black and come with him to dinner, at which two business friends would be taking part. While Karl was changing in the next room, the uncle sat down at the desk and looked through the English assignment he had just finished, slammed his hand on the table and shouted out loud: ""Really excellent!"" Undoubtedly, getting dressed went better when Karl heard this praise - te, but he was actually quite sure of his English.","One day his uncle turned up just as it was time for dinner, which Karl was about to eat by himself as usual, and told him to get into a dark suit and eat with him and a couple of business friends of his. While Karl was changing in the room next door, the uncle sat down at his desk and looked through an English exercise Karl had just completed, slammed his hand down on the desk and called out, ‘Really excellent!’ His dressing seemed to go better when he heard that praise, but in fact he was now pretty confident of his English.","One day his uncle arrived just before dinner, which Karl had expected to eat alone as usual, and asked that he put on a black suit right away and accompany him to dinner, at which two business friends would join them. As Karl was changing next door, his uncle sat down at his desk, leafed through an English lesson that Karl had just finished, slapped his hand down on the table, and cried: “Truly excellent!” Though Karl undoubtedly did a better job dressing after hearing this praise, he was already quite confident about his English."
"„Habe ich dir nicht gesagt, was du jetzt zu tun hast"", sagte Brunelda, „beeile dich. Ich bin müde"", fügte sie hinzu und streckte dann die Arme in die Höhe, so daß sich ihre Brust noch viel mehr wölbte als gewöhnlich. Delamarche, der sie noch immer umfaßt hielt, zog sie mit sich in eine Ecke des Balkons. Robinson ging ihnen nach, um die Überbleibsel seines Essens, die noch dort lagen, beiseite zu schieben.","""Didn't I tell you what you have to do now,"" Brunelda said, ""hurry up. I'm tired,"" she added, and then stretched her arms in the air so that her chest bulged a lot more than usual . Delamarche, still holding her, drew her to a corner of the balcony. Robinson went after them to push aside what was left of his food that was still there.","‘Didn’t I tell you what you had to do,’ said Brunelda, ‘hurry up. I’m tired,’ she added, and stretched her arms up in the air, so that her breasts arced even more pronouncedly than they did otherwise. Delamarche, who was still holding her in his embrace, pulled her across to a corner of the balcony. Robinson went after them, to remove the last traces of his meal, which he had left there.","“Haven’t I told you what you must do now,” said Brunelda, “hurry up. I’m tired,” she added, stretching her arms up in such a way that her breasts bulged out even more than usual. Delamarche, who was still clasping her, pulled her off into a corner of the room. Robinson followed them in order to push aside the leftovers from his meal, which were still strewn on the floor."
"„Mehr wollen wir nicht wissen"", sagte der Portier im Namen aller. Die Oberköchin wandte sich stumm zum Oberkellner und dann zu Terese.","""That's all we want to know,"" said the porter on behalf of everyone. The head cook turned silently to the head waiter and then to Terese.","‘That’s all we want to know,’ said the porter in the name of everyone there. The Head Cook turned silently to the Head Waiter and then to Therese.","“That’s all we wish to know,” said the porter, speaking on behalf of everybody else. The head cook turned silently to the head porter and then to Therese."
"Es war ganz still im Zimmer. Der Oberportier sah Erklärungen fordernd auf den Oberkellner, dieser sah auf die Oberköchin und schüttelte den Kopf. Der Lif- junge Bess grinste recht sinnlos hinter dem Rücken des Oberkellners. Terese schluchzte vor Freude und Leid in sich hinein und hatte alle Mühe es niemanden hören zu lassen.","It was very quiet in the room. Demanding explanations, the head porter looked at the head waiter, who looked at the head cook and shook his head. Lif boy Bess was grinning rather pointlessly behind the head waiter's back. Terese sobbed to herself with joy and sorrow and had every effort not to let anyone hear.","It was very quiet in the room. The Head Porter looked to the Head Waiter for some explanation, but he went on looking at the Head Cook, and shook his head. The lift-boy Bess was grinning fatuously behind the Head Waiter’s back. Therese was sobbing quietly with joy and worry, trying hard to keep the others from noticing.","The room fell silent. The head porter looked at the head waiter, demanding an explanation; the latter looked at the head cook and shook his head. Behind the head porter’s back, Bess, the lift boy, grinned absurdly. Therese sobbed in joy and sorrow and had to make a great effort to prevent others from overhearing her sobs."
"„Dem Heizer wird geschehn, was er verdient"", sagte der Senator, „und was der Herr Kapitän erachtet. Ich glaube wir haben von dem Heizer genug und übergenug, wozu mir jeder der anwesenden Herren sicher zustim- men wird.""","""The stoker will get what he deserves,"" said the senator, ""and what the captain thinks. I think we have enough and more than enough from the stoker, which every gentleman present will certainly agree with me.""","‘The stoker will get whatever he deserves,’ said the Senator, ‘and whatever the captain determines. But I’m sure the company will agree we’ve had enough and more than enough of the stoker.’","“The stoker will get what he deserves,” said the senator, “and what the captain considers appropriate. Besides, I think we’ve had enough of the stoker, more than enough, as I’m sure all the other gentlemen will agree.”"
"Mit einem Male aber wieder lebhaf werdend rief sie und faßte dabei Karls Hände: „Jetzt da es sich herausge- stellt hat, daß Sie mein Landsmann sind, dürfen Sie um keinen Preis von hier fort. Das dürfen Sie mir nicht antun. Hätten Sie z. B. Lust Lifjunge zu werden? Sagen Sie nur ja und Sie sind es. Wenn Sie ein bißchen herum- gekommen sind, werden Sie wissen daß es nicht beson- ders leicht ist, solche Stellen zu bekommen, denn sie sind der beste Anfang, den man sich denken kann. Sie kommen mit allen Gästen zusammen, man sieht Sie im- mer, man gibt Ihnen kleine Aufräge, kurz, Sie haben jeden Tag die Möglichkeit, zu etwas Besserem zu gelan- gen. Für alles übrige lassen Sie mich sorgen!"" „Lifjunge möchte ich ganz gerne sein"", sagte Karl nach einer klei- nen Pause. Es wäre ein großer Unsinn gewesen, gegen die Stelle eines Lifjungen mit Rücksicht auf seine fünf Gymnasialklassen Bedenken zu haben. Eher wäre hier in Amerika Grund gewesen, sich der fünf Gymnasialklas- sen zu schämen. Übrigens hatten die Lifjungen Karl immer gefallen, sie waren ihm wie der Schmuck der Ho- tels vorgekommen. „Sind nicht Sprachenkenntnisse er- forderlich?"" fragte er noch. „Sie sprechen Deutsch und ein schönes Englisch, das genügt vollkommen."" „Eng- lisch habe ich erst in Amerika in zweieinhalb Monaten erlernt"", sagte Karl, er glaubte, seinen einzigen Vorzug nicht verschweigen zu dürfen. „Das spricht schon genü- gend für Sie"", sagte die Oberköchin. „Wenn ich daran denke, welche Schwierigkeiten mir das Englisch gemacht hat. Das ist allerdings schon seine dreißig Jahre her. Ge- rade gestern habe ich davon gesprochen. Gestern war nämlich mein fünfzigster Geburtstag."" Und sie suchte lächelnd den Eindruck von Karls Mienen abzulesen, den die Würde dieses Alters auf ihn machte. „Dann wünsche ich Ihnen viel Glück"", sagte Karl. „Das kann man im- mer brauchen"", sagte sie, schüttelte Karl die Hand und wurde wieder halb traurig, über diese alte Redensart aus der Heimat, die ihr da im Deutschsprechen eingefallen war.","Suddenly coming to life again, she cried out and took Karl's hands: ""Now that it has turned out that you are my countryman, you must not leave here at any price. You can't do that to me. Would you have e.g. B. Would you like to become a Lifjunge? Just say yes and you are. If you've got around a bit you'll know that it's not easy to get such jobs, because they're the best place to start. You get together with all the guests, you're always seen, you're given small orders, in short, every day you have the opportunity to achieve something better. Let me take care of everything else!"" ""I'd like Lifjunge like to be,"" said Karl after a short pause. It would have been utter nonsense to have misgivings about the position of a Lifjungen because of his five high school classes. Here in America there would have been more reason to be ashamed of the five high school classes. Incidentally, Karl had always liked the Lifjungen, they struck him as the ornaments of hotels. ""Aren't language skills required?"" he asked. ""You speak German and a good level of English, that's quite enough."" ""I only learned English in two and a half months in America,"" said Karl, feeling that he shouldn't conceal his only advantage. ""That says enough for you,"" said the head cook. “When I think about the difficulties I had with English. However, that was thirty years ago. I was just talking about it yesterday. Yesterday was my fiftieth birthday."" And she smiled and tried to read the impression on Karl's face that the dignity of this age made on him. ""Then I wish you the best of luck,"" said Karl. ""You can always use that,"" she said, shaking Karl's hand and becoming half sad again at this old saying from home that had occurred to her while she was speaking German.","Then suddenly becoming animated again, she seized Karl’s hands and cried: ‘Now that it has emerged that you are my fellow countryman, you mustn’t leave here at any price. I won’t let you do that to me. How would you like to be lift-boy, for example? You only have to say the word. If you’ve been around a bit, you will know that it’s not particularly easy to get jobs like that, because they are really the best openings imaginable. You get to meet all the guests, you’re always on view, you keep getting little jobs to do, in short, every day you get a chance to better your status. Leave all the rest to me!’ ‘I wouldn’t mind being a lift-boy,’ said Karl, after a short pause. It would have been very foolish of him to hold out against the job of lift-boy on the strength of his five years in secondary school. Here in America it would be more appropriate to be ashamed of those five years of school. And in point of fact, Karl had always liked lift-boys, he thought of them as an ornament of hotels. ‘Don’t you need languages?’ he asked. ‘You speak German and good English, that’s perfectly adequate.’ ‘But all my English I’ve learned in just two and a half months in America,’ said Karl, thinking he shouldn’t hide his one light under a bushel. ‘ That says everything about you,’ said the Head Cook. ‘When I think of the trouble I had learning English. Admittedly that was thirty years ago now. I was talking about it only yesterday. Yesterday was my fiftieth birthday.’ And with a smile she turned to see what impression such a great age made on Karl. ‘I wish you many happy returns,’ said Karl. ‘That would always come in useful,’ she said, shook Karl’s hand, and was once again half melancholy at the old phrase from home, which had come to her as she spoke German.","Suddenly becoming animated again, she took Karl’s hands and cried: “Now that you’ve turned out to be my compatriot, you absolutely mustn’t go away. You simply cannot do that to me. Would you like, say, to be a lift boy? Just indicate ‘yes,’ and the post is yours. Once you’ve seen a bit more, you’ll realize that it isn’t especially easy to find such jobs, since it’s impossible to imagine a better place in which to start out. You’ll get to meet all of the guests, you’ll always be visible and will be entrusted with little tasks; in short, every single day you’ll get a chance to better your lot. And I’ll take care of everything else!” “I should very much like to be a lift boy,” said Karl, after a brief pause. It would be pointless to have reservations about the lift boy position simply because of his five years in secondary school. Here in America there would be sufficient reason to feel ashamed of those five years in secondary school. Besides, Karl had always liked lift boys; he had always considered them the jewels of a hotel. “Isn’t a knowledge of foreign languages required?” he insisted. “You speak German, and beautiful English too. That’s quite sufficient.” “I first began to learn English on coming to America two and a half months ago,” said Karl; he thought he should not hide the only advantage he possessed. “That’s already enough of a recommendation,” said the head cook, “when I think of the difficulties I myself had with English. But that was some thirty years ago. I was talking about this only yesterday. You see, yesterday was my fiftieth birthday.” And with a smile she sought to determine from Karl’s countenance the impression her dignified age had left. “Then I wish you good luck,” said Karl. “One can always use that,” she said; she shook Karl’s hand and was half-saddened again by this old expression from her homeland, which had occurred to her while she was speaking German."
"len"", sagte Robinson und sah Karl an.","len,"" said Robinson, looking at Karl.","‘Then I could start feeling better very soon,’ said Robinson, looking at Karl.","“Then I could certainly start recovering right away,” said Robinson, glancing at Karl."
"Karl konnte sich tatsächlich nicht enthalten, alles das genau zu verfolgen, trotzdem der Oberportier, der sich gesetzt hatte, ihn in einer Art Umklammerung vor sich hinhielt. „Es ist meine Pflicht"", sagte der Oberportier und schüttelte Karl, als wolle er nur erreichen, daß dieser ihm sein Gesicht zuwende, „das was der Oberkellner aus welchen Gründen immer versäumt hat, im Namen der Hoteldirektion wenigstens ein wenig nachzuholen. So tritt hier immer jeder für den andern ein. Ohne das wäre ein so großer Betrieb undenkbar. Du willst viel- leicht sagen, daß ich nicht Dein unmittelbarer Vorge- setzter bin, nun desto schöner ist es von mir, daß ich mich dieser sonst verlassenen Sache annehme. Im übri- gen bin ich in gewissem Sinne als Oberportier über alle gesetzt, denn mir unterstehn doch alle Tore des Hotels, also dieses Haupttor, die drei Mittel- und die zehn Ne- bentore, von den unzähligen Türchen und türlosen Aus- gängen gar nicht zu reden. Natürlich haben mir alle in Betracht kommenden Bedienungsmannschafen unbe- dingt zu gehorchen. Gegenüber diesen großen Ehren habe ich natürlich anderseits vor der Hoteldirektion die Verpflichtung niemanden herauszulassen, der nur im ge- ringsten verdächtig ist. Gerade Du aber kommst mir, weil es mir so beliebt sogar stark verdächtig vor."" Und vor Freude darüber hob er die Hände und ließ sie wieder stark zurückschlagen, daß es klatschte und wehtat. „Es ist möglich"", fügte er hinzu und unterhielt sich dabei königlich, „daß Du bei einem andern Ausgang unbe- merkt herausgekommen wärest, denn Du standst mir natürlich nicht dafür, besondere Anweisungen Deinet- wegen ergehen zu lassen. Aber da Du nun einmal hier bist, will ich Dich genießen. Im übrigen habe ich nicht daran gezweifelt, daß Du das Rendezvous, das wir uns beim Haupttor gegeben hatten auch einhalten wirst, denn das ist eine Regel, daß der Freche und Unfolgsame gerade dort und dann mit seinen Lastern aufört, wo es ihm schadet. Du wirst das an Dir selbst gewiß noch of beobachten können.""","In fact, Karl couldn't help but follow all this closely, even though the head porter, who had sat down, was holding him in a kind of embrace. ""It's my duty,"" said the head porter and shook Karl, as if he just wanted to get Karl to turn his face to him, ""whatever the head waiter neglected, for whatever reason, to make up for at least a little on behalf of the hotel management. Come on everyone here for one another. Without that, such a large company would be unthinkable. You may want to say that I am not your immediate superior, now it is all the nicer of me that I take on this otherwise neglected matter Apart from that, as head porter, I am in a certain sense placed above everyone, because I am responsible for all the gates of the hotel, i.e. this main gate, the three middle gates and the ten side gates, as well as the innumerable little doors and doorless exits not to speak. Of course, all the waiting staff who come into consideration must obey me unconditionally. In view of these great honours, on the other hand, I naturally have the obligation before the hotel management not to let anyone out , who is only remotely suspicious. But you in particular strike me as very suspicious, because I like it so much."" And with joy he raised his hands and let them bang back so hard that it clapped and hurt. ""It's possible,"" he added and talked royally, “that if the outcome had been different you would have come out unnoticed, because of course you didn’t stand for me to issue special instructions because of you. But since you are here, I want to enjoy you. Besides, I had no doubts that you would keep the rendezvous that we had made at the main gate, because it is a rule that the impudent and unruly one stops his vices just there and then, where it harms him. You will certainly often be able to observe this in yourself.""","Karl simply couldn’t resist observing it all closely, even though the Head Porter had sat down, holding him in front of him in a kind of embrace. ‘It is my duty,’ said the Head Porter, and shook Karl, as though to get him to face him, ‘in the name of hotel management, at least to some extent, to catch up on what the Head Waiter, for whatever reason, has failed to do. We always stand in for each other here. Otherwise such a great enterprise would be impossible. You may say that I’m not your immediate superior, but that only makes it more creditable of me to interest myself in this otherwise neglected business. Besides, as Head Porter, I am in a certain sense put in charge of everything, because I am in charge of all the hotel entrances, this main entrance here, the three central and ten side entrances, not to mention the innumerable little doors and other exits. Of course all the service teams concerned have a duty of unconditional obedience to me. In return for these signal honours, I am charged by the management not to let anyone out who is in the slightest degree suspicious to me. You, I would say, are strongly suspicious.’ And delighted with that he lifted his hands off Karl and let them fall again, which made a smacking noise and hurt. ‘It is possible’, he went on, enjoying himself hugely, ‘that you might have managed to slip out unobserved at one of the other gates, because it’s not worth my while issuing special instructions just for you. But seeing as you’re here now, I’d like to make the most of you. In fact I never had any doubt in my mind that you would keep our appointment at the main entrance, because it is a rule that a cheeky and insubordinate party will only forsake his vices where it will do him the most damage. You will be able to observe this in yourself many times yet.’","Karl could not resist the temptation to follow all this closely, even though the head porter, who had sat down, held him in some kind of hold. “I am duty bound,” said the head porter, and he shook Karl as if he simply wanted to get him to turn his face toward him, “to make up at least partially on behalf of the hotel management for what the head waiter himself has somehow, for whatever reasons, repeatedly failed to do. Here everybody covers for everyone else. Otherwise an operation of this size would be inconceivable. You may object that I’m not your immediate supervisor, but that only makes it all the more remarkable that I should take on this derelict affair. Besides, as head porter I am, as it were, placed above everybody else since I’m responsible for all of the hotel gates, in other words, the main gate, the three middle ones, and the ten side ones, not to mention the countless little doors and the exits that have no doors. Naturally, all of the relevant service personnel have to obey me unconditionally. Having been entrusted with such honors, I too naturally have obligations toward the hotel management and must therefore refuse to let even slightly suspicious-looking people leave the premises. And as it so happens, I find you especially suspect.” And in sheer delight he raised his hands, then dropped them so fast that there was a great smack, which hurt. “It’s possible,” he added, sounding royally pleased, “that you could have left through another gate without being seen, for I didn’t want to bother issuing special instructions just for you. But now that you’re here, I’m going to get some pleasure out of you. Besides, I never doubted that you’d turn up at the main gate for our little rendezvous, since a person who is cheeky and disobedient will usually give up his vices just when it’s harmful for him to do so. You’ll certainly be getting frequent opportunities to experience this in person.”"
"Je besser Karls Englisch wurde, desto größere Lust zeigte der Onkel ihn mit seinen Bekannten zusammen- zuführen und ordnete nur für jeden Fall an, daß bei solchen Zusammenkünfen vorläufig der Englischpro- fessor sich immer in Karls Nähe zu halten habe. Der allererste Bekannte, dem Karl eines Vormittags vorge- stellt wurde, war ein schlanker, junger, unglaublich biegsamer Mann, den der Onkel mit besondern Kompli- menten in Karls Zimmer führte. Es war offenbar einer jener vielen vom Standpunkt der Eltern aus gesehen mißratenen Millionärssöhne, dessen Leben so verlief, daß ein gewöhnlicher Mensch auch nur einen beliebigen Tag im Leben dieses jungen Mannes nicht ohne Schmerz verfolgen konnte. Und als wisse oder ahne er dies, und als begegne er dem, soweit es in seiner Macht stand, war um seine Lippen und Augen ein unauförliches Lächeln des Glückes, das ihm selbst, seinem Gegenüber und der ganzen Welt zu gelten schien.","The better Karl's English got, the greater his uncle's desire to introduce him to his acquaintances, and he ordered that the English professor always stay close to Karl at such meetings. The very first acquaintance Karl was introduced to one morning was a slim, young, incredibly flexible man, whom the uncle took to Karl's room with special compliments. It was evidently one of those many millionaire's sons who, from the parents' point of view, had failed, whose life was such that an ordinary person could not follow any day of this young man's life without pain. And as if he knew or suspected this, and as if he were meeting it as far as he could, there was an incessant smile of happiness on his lips and eyes, which seemed to apply to himself, his counterpart and the whole world.","The more Karl’s English improved, the more inclined the uncle was to introduce him to his circle of acquaintances, decreeing that his English teacher should always accompany Karl. The very first acquaintance to whom Karl was introduced was a slim young man of astounding suppleness, whom the uncle ushered into Karl’s room with a whole shower of compliments. He was obviously one of those millionaire’s sons who from their parents’ point of view have gone wrong, and whose life was such that no normal person could have followed so much as a single day of it without pain. As though in recognition of this, there was about his lips and eyes a continual smile for the good fortune that seemed to have been granted to him, to those he met and indeed to the whole world.","The greater the improvement in his English, the more eager was his uncle to have him meet his acquaintances, and he arranged that during these encounters the English teacher should for the time being always remain near Karl, simply in case of need. The very first acquaintance to whom Karl was introduced one morning was a young, thin, and incredibly supple young man, whom his uncle led into Karl’s room amid a shower of compliments. He was obviously one of those many millionaires’ sons whose parents consider them misfits and who lead their lives in such a way that no ordinary person could observe any day in the life of this young man without feeling sad. And as if he were aware of this or at least suspected as much and were trying to counteract it, at least insofar as lay within his power, a happy smile played constantly on his lips and around his eyes, which seemed to be directed at himself, his interlocutor, and the world at large."
"So saßen sie still auf ihrem Bänkchen und warteten. Die Frau lief immerfort zwischen zwei Tischen, einem Waschbottich und dem Herd hin und her. Aus ihren Ausrufen erfuhr man, daß ihre Tochter unwohl war und sie deshalb alle Arbeit, nämlich die Bedienung und Ver- pflegung von dreißig Mietern allein besorgen mußte. Nun war noch überdies der Ofen schadhaf, das Essen wollte nicht fertig werden, in zwei riesigen Töpfen wur- de eine dicke Suppe gekocht und wie of die Frau auch sie mit Schöpflöffeln untersuchte und aus der Höhe her- abfließen ließ, die Suppe wollte nicht gelingen, es mußte wohl das schlechte Feuer daran schuld sein und so setzte sie sich vor der Herdtüre fast auf den Boden und arbeite- te mit dem Schürhaken in der glühenden Kohle herum. Der Rauch von dem die Küche erfüllt war, reizte sie zum Husten der sich manchmal so verstärkte, daß sie nach einem Stuhl griff und minutenlang nichts anderes tat als hustete. Öfers machte sie die Bemerkung, daß sie das Frühstück heute überhaupt nicht mehr liefern wer- de, weil sie dazu weder Zeit noch Lust habe. Da Karl und Robinson einerseits den Befehl hatten, das Früh- stück zu holen, andererseits aber keine Möglichkeit es zu erzwingen, antworteten sie auf solche Bemerkungen nicht, sondern blieben still sitzen wie zuvor.","So they sat quietly on their bench and waited. The woman kept pacing back and forth between two tables, a washtub, and the stove. From her exclamations we learned that her daughter was unwell and that she therefore had to do all the work herself, namely the serving and feeding of thirty tenants. Now the stove was also damaged, the food wouldn't be ready, a thick soup was being cooked in two huge pots and no matter how often the woman examined them with ladles and poured them down from above, the soup wouldn't turn out well , the bad fire must have been to blame, and so she sat down almost on the floor in front of the hearth door and worked around with the poker in the glowing coals. The smoke that filled the kitchen made her cough, which sometimes got so bad that she reached for a chair and did nothing but cough for minutes. She often remarked that she wouldn't deliver breakfast at all today because she didn't have the time or inclination to do so. Since Karl and Robinson were on the one hand ordered to fetch breakfast, but on the other hand had no way of enforcing it, they did not answer such remarks, but sat still as before.","So they sat quietly and waited on their little bench. The woman kept running between a pair of tables, a washtub and the stove. From her exclamations it could be gleaned that her daughter was poorly, and that as a result she had to do all the work by herself, which meant the serving and catering for thirty tenants. As if that weren’t enough on its own, the oven had something wrong with it, the food refused to cook, a thick soup was being prepared in two enormous saucepans, and however many times the woman inspected it with her ladles and poured it out from a height, the soup wasn’t ready, it was certainly the fault of the poor fire, and so she almost squatted down on the floor by the door of the oven, and with a poker prodded around in the glowing coals. The smoke that filled the kitchen made her cough so much that sometimes she had to reach for a chair and for minutes on end, do nothing but cough. She quite regularly remarked that she would not supply any more breakfasts today, because she had neither the time nor the inclination. As Karl and Robinson had been detailed on the one hand to get the breakfast, and on the other had no possibility of compelling her, they simply ignored such remarks of hers, and just sat quietly as before.","And thus they sat on their little bench, waiting quietly. The woman ran incessantly back and forth between two tables, a tub, and the oven. From her frequent exclamations one could gather that her daughter was not well, so she had to take care of all the work alone, in other words, the serving and feeding of thirty tenants. Besides, the oven was defective, the food took forever: there was a thick soup simmering in two giant pots, and however often the woman checked it, using ladles and letting it drip down into the pots, it simply would not turn out right, and since this was probably due to the poor fire, she sat down in front of the oven door, almost on the floor, and stirred the glowing coals with a rake. The smoke filling the kitchen made her cough, sometimes so severely that she reached for a chair and for a while could do nothing but cough. She stated repeatedly that she was not going to provide them with breakfast that late in the day, having neither the time nor the inclination to do so. Since Karl and Robinson had been ordered to fetch the breakfast but could not possibly force her to provide it, they did not respond to such remarks and simply remained there, sitting quietly on their chairs."
"Eben aber winkte der Kapitän dem Schubal ab, der daraufin sofort – denn seine Angelegenheit schien für ein Weilchen verschoben worden zu sein – beiseite trat und mit dem Diener, der sich ihm gleich angeschlossen hatte, eine leise Unterhaltung begann, bei der es an Sei- tenblicken nach dem Heizer und Karl sowie an den überzeugtesten Handbewegungen nicht fehlte. Schubal schien so seine nächste große Rede einzuüben.","But the captain was just waving Schubal away, who immediately stepped aside - for his matter seemed to have been postponed for a while - and began a quiet conversation with the servant, who had immediately joined him, in which it was glances at the stoker and Karl as well as the most confident hand movements were not lacking. Schubal seemed to be rehearsing his next big speech.","Just at that moment, though, the captain motioned to Schubal ‘enough’ and he – his affair for the moment put back a little – promptly walked off and began a quiet conversation with the servant, who had straightaway allied himself with him, a conversation not without its share of sidelong glances at the stoker and Karl, and gestures of great conviction. It seemed that Schubal was rehearsing his next big speech.","Just then, however, the captain waved away Schubal, who stepped aside at once—for his affair seemed to have been put off for a while—and, turning to the servant, who had just joined him, he began a muttered conversation, underscored by the most emphatic gestures and frequent sidelong glances at the stoker and at Karl. Schubal seemed to be preparing in this way for his next great speech."
"Da sprang Delamarche in Unterkleidung aus dem Waschraum hervor, während man Brunelda krampfaf weinen hörte. Karl und Robinson ließen vom Suchen ab und sahen den Delamarche an, der ganz und gar durch- näßt, auch vom Gesicht und von den Haaren rann ihm das Wasser, ausrief: „Jetzt also fangt gefälligst zu suchen an."" „Hier!"" befahl er zuerst Karl zu suchen und dann „dort!"" dem Robinson. Karl suchte wirklich und über- prüfe auch noch die Plätze, zu denen Robinson schon kommandiert worden war, aber er fand ebensowenig das Parfüm, wie Robinson, der eifriger, als er suchte, seitlich nach Delamarche ausschaute, der soweit der Raum reichte stampfend im Zimmer auf- und abgieng und ge- wiß am liebsten sowohl Karl wie Robinson durchgeprü- gelt hatte.","Then Delamarche jumped out of the washroom in his underwear, while Brunelda could be heard crying convulsively. Karl and Robinson stopped searching and looked at Delamarche, who was soaked through, water was running down his face and hair, and exclaimed: ""Now, kindly, start looking."" ""Here!"" he ordered first to look for Karl and then ""over there!"" for Robinson. Karl really searched and also checked the places to which Robinson had already been ordered, but he found the perfume just as little as Robinson, who was more eager than he looked sideways at Delamarche, who stamped up and down the room as far as the room could reach and would have loved to beat up both Karl and Robinson.","Then Delamarche in his underwear leapt out of the washroom, while Brunelda could be heard crying hysterically. Karl and Robinson stopped their search and looked at Delamarche, who, soaked to the skin, and with water pouring off his face and hair as well, exclaimed: ‘Now will you kindly start looking.’ ‘Here!’ he commanded Karl, and ‘You there!’ Robinson. Karl really did look, and even checked places that had already been assigned to Robinson, but he was no more able to find the perfume than Robinson, who devoted most of his energy to keeping an eye out for Delamarche, who was stamping up and down the room as far as it went, undoubtedly longing to give both Karl and Robinson a good thrashing.","Just then Delamarche jumped out of the washroom in his underwear, while Brunelda could be heard weeping convulsively. Karl and Robinson ceased to look and glanced at Delamarche, who was completely drenched, the water was even running down his face and hair, and who cried: “Kindly start searching right away!” First he ordered Karl to look by saying, “Here!” then told Robinson, “There!” Karl did look, inspecting even the places where Robinson had been ordered to search, but he had no more luck finding the perfume than did Robinson, who was less intent on searching than on glancing sideways at Delamarche, who stomped up and down in the room, insofar as he could in the tight space, and would certainly have preferred to give both Karl and Robinson a beating."
"„Jeder andere"", sagte der Oberportier und zeigte mit dem Finger auf den Oberkellner, „das ist eine Spitze gegen Sie, Herr Isbary.""","""Anyone else,"" said the head porter, pointing at the head waiter, ""that's a dig at you, Herr Isbary.""","‘Anyone,’ said the Head Porter, and pointed at the Head Waiter, ‘that’s a dig at you, Mr Isbary.’","“Everybody else,” said the head porter, pointing a finger at the head waiter, “that’s a barb directed at you, Mr. Isbary.”"
"„Ich schlafe nämlich"", sagte die Oberköchin zur Erklä- rung, „seit einigen Jahren ungemein schlecht. Jetzt kann ich ja mit meiner Stellung zufrieden sein und brauche eigentlich keine Sorgen zu haben. Aber es müssen die Folgen meiner frühern Sorgen sein, die mir diese Schlaf- losigkeit verursachen. Wenn ich um drei Uhr früh ein- schlafe kann ich froh sein. Da ich aber schon um fünf, spätestens um halb sechs wieder auf dem Platze sein muß, muß ich mich wecken lassen undzwar besonders vorsichtig, damit ich nicht noch nervöser werde als ich schon bin. Und da weckt mich eben die Terese. Aber jetzt wissen Sie wirklich schon alles und ich komme gar nicht weg. Gute Nacht!"" Und trotz ihrer Schwere huschte sie fast aus dem Zimmer.","""I've been sleeping really badly,"" said the head cook by way of explanation, ""for the last few years.

And then Terese wakes me up. But now you really know everything and I can't get away. Good night!"" And despite her weight, she almost skittered out of the room.","‘You see,’ said the Head Cook, by way of explanation, ‘for the past few years I’ve been sleeping extremely badly. I am happy in my job, and don’t really have anything to worry about. So my sleeplessness must be caused by the worries I had earlier. I count myself lucky if I fall asleep by three in the morning. But seeing as I need to be back on the job by five or half past at the latest, I have to be woken up, and very carefully at that, so that I don’t become even more nervous than I am already. And so I have Therese wake me. But now you’re fully informed, and I’m holding you up. Goodnight!’ And in spite of her bulk, she positively skipped out of the room.","“You see,” the head cook said by way of explanation, “I’ve been sleeping very badly these past few years. At present I can certainly be satisfied with my position and really don’t need to worry at all. But those earlier worries must be causing my insomnia. I can count myself lucky if I manage to fall asleep at three in the morning. But since I have to be back on duty as early as five, or at the latest at five-thirty, I need to have someone awaken me gently, so I don’t become even more nervous than I already am. And so it’s Therese who wakes me. But you really know everything now and I haven’t gone yet. Good night!” And despite her heaviness she almost glided from the room."
"„Du Robinson"", sagte Karl, „das ist aber ein schwerer Dienst. Da hast Du mich für einen schönen Posten emp- fohlen.""","""You Robinson,"" said Karl, ""that's a tough job.

"In dem Augenblick, als Karl die Luke freigelegt hatte, hob einer der Schläfer die Arme und Beine ein wenig in die Höhe, was einen derartigen Anblick bot, daß Karl trotz seiner Sorgen in sich hineinlachte.","The moment Karl uncovered the hatch, one of the sleepers lifted his arms and legs a little, which was such a sight that Karl laughed to himself despite his worries.","Just when Karl pulled aside the curtain, one of the sleepers raised his arms and legs in the air a little, which looked so ridiculous that Karl, for all his worries, had to laugh silently to himself.","Just as Karl uncovered the attic window, one of the sleepers lifted his arms and legs up a little into the air, presenting such a spectacle that Karl, despite his worries, laughed inwardly."

"Nun ließ sich aber Giacomo nicht mehr halten und aufgeregt durch das lange Warten rief er laut: „Roß- mann, der Mann wälzt sich unten im Gang und will sich nicht wegschaffen lassen. Sie wollten ihn ins Kranken- haus bringen lassen, aber er wehrt sich und behauptet, Du würdest niemals dulden, daß er ins Krankenhaus kommt. Man solle ein Automobil nehmen und ihn nach- hause schicken, Du werdest das Automobil bezahlen. Willst Du?""","But now Giacomo couldn't be stopped any longer and, excited by the long wait, he called out loudly: “Roßmann, the man is tossing and turning in the aisle and doesn't want to be taken away. They wanted to take him to the hospital, but he resists, claiming that you would never allow him to go to the hospital. One should take an automobile and send him home, you will pay for the automobile. Do you want?""","Now there was no more stopping Giacomo, and excited after his long wait he called out: ‘Rossmann, the man is rolling about in the corridor downstairs and refuses to be taken away. They wanted to have him taken to hospital but he wouldn’t go and says you’d never let him be sent to a hospital. He wants to be driven home in a car, and says you’ll pay for the car. Will you?’","Now, however, Giacomo, could no longer contain himself, and upset over the long wait, he called out in a loud voice: “Rossmann, that man is rolling about in the corridor downstairs and won’t let us cart him off. We wanted to send him to the hospital, but he’s putting up a fight and insists you would never stand for his being taken to the hospital. He told us we should hire a car and send him home, and you’d pay for the car. Is that what you want?”"
"Gerade streckte er sich nach einer gründlichen Wa- schung des ganzen Körpers, die er seiner Nachbarin we- gen möglichst leise durchzuführen sich bemüht hatte, im Vorgenuß des Schlafes auf seinem Kanapee, da glaubte er ein schwaches Klopfen an einer Türe zu hören. Man konnte nicht gleich feststellen, an welcher Tür es war, es konnte auch bloß ein zufälliges Geräusch sein. Es wie- derholte sich auch nicht gleich und Karl schlief schon fast, als es wieder erfolgte. Aber nun war kein Zweifel mehr, daß es ein Klopfen war und von der Tür der Schreibmaschinistin herkam. Karl lief auf den Fußspit- zen zur Tür hin und fragte so leise, daß es, wenn man trotz allem nebenan doch schlief, niemanden hätte wek- ken können: „Wünschen Sie etwas?"" Sofort und ebenso leise kam die Antwort: „Möchten Sie nicht die Tür öff- nen? Der Schlüssel steckt auf Ihrer Seite."" „Bitte"", sagte Karl, „ich muß mich nur zuerst anziehn."" Es gab eine kleine Pause, dann hieß es: „Das ist nicht nötig. Machen Sie auf und legen Sie sich ins Bett, ich werde ein wenig warten."" „Gut"", sagte Karl und führte es auch so aus, nur drehte er außerdem noch das elektrische Licht auf. „Ich liege schon"", sagte er dann etwas lauter. Da trat auch schon aus ihrem dunklen Zimmer die kleine Schreibmaschinistin, genau so angezogen wie unten im Bureau, sie hatte wohl die ganze Zeit über nicht daran gedacht schlafen zu gehn.","He was just stretching after a thorough washing of his whole body, which he had tried to do as quietly as possible for the sake of his neighbor, in anticipation of sleeping on his sofa, when he thought he heard a faint knock on a door. You couldn't immediately tell which door it was on, it could just be a random noise. It didn't happen again straight away and Karl was almost asleep when it happened again. But now there was no longer any doubt that it was a knock, coming from the typewriter's door. Karl tiptoed to the door and asked so quietly that if, despite everything, they were sleeping next door, nobody could have been awakened: ""Do you want something?"" The answer came immediately and just as quietly: ""Would you like Don't you open the door? The key is on your side."" ""Please,"" said Karl, ""I just have to get dressed first."" There was a short pause, then it was said: “That's not necessary. Get up and go to bed, I'll wait a bit.' 'Fine,' said Karl and did as he did, only he also turned on the electric light. ""I'm lying down,"" he said a little louder. Then the little typist came out of her dark room, dressed exactly as she was downstairs in the office, she had probably not thought about going to sleep the whole time.","He was just stretching out on the sofa, looking forward to his sleep after thoroughly washing himself all over, as quietly as possible on account of his neighbour, when he thought he heard a quiet knocking on the door. He wasn’t quite sure which door it was, and it might also have been just a noise. There was no immediate repetition of it, and Karl was on the point of sleep when it happened again. This time there could be no question but that it was a knock, coming from the door of the typist’s room. Karl went over to the door on tiptoe and asked, in a voice so quiet that it wouldn’t have woken his neighbour if she had happened to be asleep: ‘What can I do for you?’ Straightaway, and just as quietly, came the reply: ‘Won’t you open the door? The key is on your side.’ ‘Of course,’ said Karl. ‘Just let me get dressed first.’ There was a slight pause, and then: ‘You don’t have to. Open the door and go and lie down in your bed again, I’ll wait a moment.’ ‘ Very well,’ said Karl, and did as she suggested, only he turned the electric light on as well. ‘I’m ready,’ he said, a little louder. And at that the little typist emerged from her dark room, wearing exactly the same clothes she had had on downstairs in the office, she probably hadn’t thought about going to bed in all that time.","Stretching out after a thorough washing of his entire body, which he had sought to carry out as quietly as possible on account of his neighbor, and eagerly anticipating how pleasant it would be to sleep on his settee, Karl thought he could hear a faint knock on one of the doors. It was impossible to determine on which door—perhaps it had simply been some incidental noise. Besides, the sound did not repeat itself at once, and Karl was almost asleep when it came again. But now there was no longer any doubt that it was indeed a knock and that it came from the typist’s door. On his tiptoes Karl ran to the door and asked so softly that even if, despite everything, someone were still asleep next door, his voice couldn’t have awakened anyone: “You’d like something?” The reply came at once: “Would you care to open the door? The key is on your side.” “Please,” said Karl, “I must get dressed first.” For a moment there was silence, followed by the words: “It’s not necessary. Just open the door and get in bed. I shall wait a moment.” “Fine,” said Karl, who did as he was told, and he also turned up the electric light. “I’m in bed now,” he said in a louder voice. And then, from her dark room, dressed exactly as she had been in the office downstairs, the little typist emerged; during all that time she had probably not thought of going to sleep."
"„Ganz richtig"", sagte Robinson. „Wo sollte man auch die Dienerschaf hier unterbringen? Diese Diener sind ja sehr anspruchsvolle Herren. Einmal hat Delamarche bei der Brunelda einen solchen Diener einfach mit Ohrfei- gen aus dem Zimmer getrieben, da ist eine nach der andern geflogen, bis der Mann draußen war. Natürlich haben die andern Diener sich mit ihm vereinigt und vor der Tür Lärm gemacht, da ist Delamarche herausgekom- men (ich war damals nicht Diener, sondern Hausfreund, aber doch war ich mit den Dienern beisammen) und hat gefragt: ‚Was wollt ihr?' Der älteste Diener, ein gewisser Isidor, hat daraufin gesagt: ‚Sie haben mit uns nichts zu reden, unsere Herrin ist die gnädige Frau.' Wie Du wahrscheinlich merkst haben sie Brunelda sehr verehrt. Aber Brunelda ist ohne sich um sie zu kümmern, zu Delamarche gelaufen, sie war damals doch noch nicht so schwer wie jetzt, hat ihn vor allen umarmt, geküßt und ‚liebster Delamarche' genannt. ‚Und schick doch schon diese Affen weg', hat sie endlich gesagt. Affen – das sollten die Diener sein, stell Dir die Gesichter vor, die sie da machten. Dann hat die Brunelda die Hand des Dela- marche zu ihrer Geldtasche hingezogen die sie am Gür- tel trug, Delamarche hat hineingegriffen und also ange- fangen die Diener auszuzahlen, die Brunelda hat sich nur dadurch an der Auszahlung beteiligt, daß sie mit der offenen Geldtasche im Gürtel dabei gestanden ist. Dela- marche mußte of hineingreifen, denn er verteilte das Geld, ohne zu zählen und ohne die Forderungen zu prüfen. Schließlich sagte er: Da Ihr also mit mir nicht reden wollt, sage ich Euch nur im Namen Bruneldas ‚Packt Euch, aber sofort.' So sind sie entlassen worden, es gab dann noch einige Processe, Delamarche mußte sogar einmal zum Gericht, aber davon weiß ich nichts genaueres. Nur gleich nach dem Abschied der Diener hat Delamarche zur Brunelda gesagt: ‚Jetzt hast Du also keine Dienerschaf?' Sie hat gesagt: ‚Aber da ist ja Ro- binson.' Daraufin hat Delamarche gesagt und hat mir dabei einen Schlag auf die Achsel gegeben: ‚Also gut, Du wirst unser Diener sein.' Und Brunelda hat mir dann auf die Wange geklopf, wenn sich die Gelegenheit findet, Roßmann, laß Dir auch einmal von ihr auf die Wangen klopfen, Du wirst staunen, wie schön das ist.""","""Quite right,"" said Robinson. ""Where should one put the servants here? These servants are very demanding gentlemen. Once at Brunelda's, Delamarche simply drove one of these servants out of the room with a slap in the face, there's one after the other flew to the others until the man was outside. Of course, the other servants joined him and made a noise outside the door, so Delamarche came out (I wasn’t a servant at the time, but a friend of the family, but I was with the servants anyway). and asked: 'What do you want?' The oldest servant, a certain Isidor, then said: 'You have nothing to talk to us about, our mistress is the gracious lady.' As you can probably tell, they adored Brunelda very much. But Brunelda ran to Delamarche without paying any attention to her, she wasn't as heavy then as she is now, hugged him, kissed him and called him 'dearest Delamarche' in front of everyone.' ""And send those monkeys away already,' she said at last. Monkeys - those should be the servants, imagine the faces they were making. Then Brunelda pulled Delamarche's hand towards her purse, which she held on was wearing a belt, Delamarche reached in and started to pay out the servants, Brunelda only participated in the payment by standing there with the money bag open in her belt. Delamarche often had to reach in, because he was handing out the money without counting and without examining the claims. Finally he said: Since you don't want to talk to me, I'm just telling you on behalf of Brunelda, 'Pack yourselves, but now.' So they were dismissed, there were still a few lawsuits, Delamarche even had to go to court once, but I don't know anything more about that. Just after the servants had said goodbye, Delamarche said to Brunelda: 'So you don't have any servants now?' She said: 'But there's Robinson.' Then Delamarche said and gave me a slap on the shoulder: 'All right, you will be our servant.' And Brunelda would pat me on the cheek when the opportunity arose, Roßmann, let her pat you on the cheek, you'll be amazed at how nice it is.""","‘That’s right,’ said Robinson. ‘Where was there for them to stay here anyway? These servants are a very pampered lot. Once at Brunelda’s, Delamarche drove one of them out of the room with a succession of slaps, left and right, until the fellow was out of the door. Then of course all the other servants got together with him and made a noise outside the door, and then Delamarche came out (in those days I wasn’t a servant, I was a friend of the family’s, though I mostly hung around with the servants), and asked: “What d’you want?” The oldest servant, a fellow by the name of Isidor, said: “You have nothing to say to us, madam is our mistress.” As you probably noticed, they worshipped Brunelda. But Brunelda ran over to Delamarche without bothering about them, she wasn’t so heavy then as she is now, and hugged and kissed him in front of them all, and called him “darling Delamarche”. “And get rid of those jackanapes” she finally said. Jackanapes – she was referring to the servants, you should have seen their expression. Then Brunelda pulled Delamarche’s hand down to the purse that she wore round her waist, and Delamarche reached into it and started paying off the servants, Brunelda played no part in it, other than standing there with an open purse at her waist. Delamarche had to reach into it a lot, because he handed out the money without counting it and without checking the claims they made. Finally he said: “Since you don’t want to talk to me, I’d just like to tell you in Brunelda ’s name: Get out of here, and make it fast.” And that was how they were dismissed, there was some wrangling after that, Delamarche even had to go to court once, but I don’t really know what happened there. But immediately the servants were all gone, Delamarche said to Brunelda: “So now you’ve got no servants?” She said: “But what about Robinson.” And Delamarche gave me a slap on the back and said: “All right, you can be our servant.” And Brunelda gave me a pat on the cheek, if you ever get a chance, Rossmann, get her to pat you on the cheek, there’s nothing like it.’","“You’re quite right,” said Robinson. “For where could they house the servants? As for those servants, they’re certainly a demanding lot. Once at Brunelda’s, Delamarche drove one such servant from the room by slapping him repeatedly until he was outside. The other servants naturally took his side and began to make a racket outside the door, then Delamarche came out ( though I wasn’t a servant then but rather a friend of the house, they put me in with the servants) and asked: ‘What do you want?’ The oldest servant, a certain Isidor, said: ‘You cannot say anything to us since it’s Madame who’s our mistress.’ As you’ve probably noticed, they greatly admired Brunelda. But ignoring them, Brunelda ran over to Delamarche—she was not so heavy yet—hugged him in front of everyone, kissed him, and called him ‘dearest Delamarche.’ ‘And do send these apes away at once,’ she said at last. Apes —that was what she called the servants; you can imagine their faces when they heard that. Then Brunelda steered Delamarche’s hand to the purse she had on her belt, Delamarche reached inside and began to pay off the servants; Brunelda merely stood there with her purse open. Delamarche had to reach inside quite often, for he handed out the money without counting it or checking the servants’ claims. At last he said: ‘Well, since you don’t want to talk to me, I’ll simply say this on behalf of Brunelda: “Clear off at once.” ’ That’s how the servants were dismissed; there were a few court cases, Delmarche even had to appear in court once, but I don’t have any specific information about that. After the servants had left, though, Delamarche said to Brunelda: ‘But now you don’t have any servants?’ She said: ‘ Well, there’s always Robinson.’ At that Delamarche slapped me on the shoulder and said: ‘So you’ll be our servant.’ And Brunelda gave me a little tap on the cheek; if you ever have the opportunity, Rossmann, ask her to give you a little tap on the cheek, you’ll be amazed how lovely it is.”"
"Das Rücken eines Tisches auf dem Nachbarbalkon machte Karl aufmerksam, dort saß ja jemand und stu- dierte.

Wenn das die Haupthalle des Hauses war – im Schimmer der Kerze erschien ein Stück einer gewölbeartig geführ- ten Decke – warum war man nicht durch diese Halle eingetreten? Wozu diente nur dieser große tiefe Raum? Man stand ja hier oben wie auf der Gallerie einer Kirche. Karl bedauerte fast, nicht bis morgen in diesem Hause bleiben zu können, er hätte gern bei Tageslicht von Herrn Pollunder sich überall herumführen und über al- les unterrichten lassen.","Suddenly the wall on one side of the corridor ended and an ice-cold marble banister took its place. Karl put the candle next to him and carefully leaned over. Dark emptiness blew towards him. If this was the main hall of the house—a piece of vaulted ceiling appeared in the glow of the candle—why hadn't one entered through that hall? What was this great, deep room for? You were standing up here like on the gallery of a church. Karl almost regretted not being able to stay in this house until tomorrow; he would have liked to have Mr. Pollunder show him around and teach him about everything in daylight.","Suddenly the wall on one side of the corridor came to an end, and was replaced by an ice-cold marble balustrade. Karl put the candle down on it and carefully leaned forward. Empty darkness blew towards him. If this was the entrance hall of the house – by the light of the candle he saw what seemed to be a bit of vaulted ceiling – why hadn’t they come in through it? What was this large and lofty room for? It was like standing in the gallery of a church up here. Karl almost regretted that he couldn’t stay in the house till morning, he would like to have had a guided tour of it by daylight from Mr Pollunder.","Suddenly the wall on one side of the corridor ended and gave way to an ice-cold marble balustrade. Karl put down the candle and leaned over cautiously. A dark void wafted toward him. If this was the main hall in the house—in the glimmer from the candle one could now distinguish part of the vaultlike ceiling—why hadn’t they entered through this hall? What purpose could be served by this large, deep space? One stood as if in the gallery of a church. Karl almost regretted not being able to stay until the following day; he would have liked to be led around by Pollunder and have him explain everything to him in the daylight."
"„Begreifen Sie doch junger Mann Ihr Glück"", sagte der Kapitän, der durch die Frage die Würde der Person des Herrn Jakob verletzt glaubte, der sich zum Fenster gestellt hatte, offenbar um sein aufgeregtes Gesicht, das er überdies mit einem Taschentuch betupfe, den andern nicht zeigen zu müssen. „Es ist der Staatsrat Edward Jakob, der sich Ihnen als Ihr Onkel zu erkennen gegeben hat. Es erwartet Sie nunmehr, doch wohl ganz gegen Ihre bisherigen Erwartungen eine glänzende Laufahn. Versuchen Sie das einzusehn, so gut es im ersten Augen- blick geht und fassen Sie sich.""","""Don't you understand how lucky you are, young man,"" said the captain, who believed that the question violated the dignity of Herr Jakob, who had stood by the window, obviously concerned about his excited face, which he was also dabbing with a handkerchief not to have to show others. ""It is the Councilor of State Edward Jakob, who has made himself known to you as your uncle. You are now awaiting a brilliant career, but probably quite contrary to your previous expectations. Try to see that as well as you can go at first and collect yourself.""","‘Don’t you see you’re a very lucky young man,’ said the captain, who thought the question might have hurt the dignity of Mr Jakob who had gone over to the window, obviously in order to keep the others from seeing the emotion on his face, which he kept dabbing at with a handkerchief. ‘The man who has presented himself to you as your uncle is the state councillor Edward Jakob. You now have a glittering career ahead of you, which you surely cannot have expected. Try to understand that, though it isn’t easy, and pull yourself together.’","“Try, young man, try to understand your good fortune,” said the captain, who believed that the question that Karl had asked had offended the dignity of Mr. Jakob, who had gone to the window, evidently to avoid having to show his agitated face, which he even dabbed with a handkerchief. “The man who identified himself as your uncle is none other than State Counselor Edward Jakob. Probably very much in contrast to your previous expectations, you can now look forward to a dazzling career. Try to understand this as well as you can right now, and make an effort to pull yourself together.”"

"Ein junger Mann, mit dem er während der Fahrt flüchtig bekannt geworden war sagte im Vorübergehn: „Ja haben Sie denn noch keine Lust auszusteigen?"" „Ich bin doch fertig"", sagte Karl ihn anlachend und hob, aus Übermut und weil er ein starker Junge war, den Koffer auf die Achsel. Aber wie er über seinen Bekannten hin- sah, der ein wenig seinen Stock schwenkend sich schon mit den andern entfernte, merkte er, daß er seinen Re- genschirm unten im Schiff vergessen hatte. Er bat schnell den Bekannten, der nicht sehr beglückt schien, um die Freundlichkeit, bei seinem Koffer einen Augenblick zu warten, überblickte schnell die Situation um sich bei der Rückkehr zurechtzufinden und eilte davon. Unten fand er zu seinem Bedauern einen Gang, der seinen Weg sehr verkürzt hätte, zum erstenmal versperrt, was wahr- scheinlich mit der Ausschiffung sämtlicher Passagiere zusammenhieng, und mußte sich seinen Weg durch eine Unzahl kleiner Räume, fortwährend abbiegende Korri- dore, kurze Treppen, die einander aber immer wieder folgten, ein leeres Zimmer mit einem verlassenen Schreib- tisch mühselig suchen, bis er sich tatsächlich, da er die- sen Weg nur ein oder zweimal und immer in größerer Gesellschaf gegangen war, ganz und gar verirrt hatte. In seiner Ratlosigkeit und da er keinen Menschen traf und nur immerfort über sich das Scharren der tausend Men- schenfüße hörte und von der Ferne wie einen Hauch das letzte Arbeiten der schon eingestellten Maschine merkte, fieng er ohne zu überlegen, an eine beliebige kleine Türe zu schlagen an, bei der er in seinem Herumirren stockte. Es ist ja offen"", rief es von innen und Karl öffnete mit ehrlichem Aufatmen die Tür. „Warum schlagen Sie so verrückt auf die Tür?"" fragte ein riesiger Mann, kaum daß er nach Karl hinsah. Durch irgendeine Oberlichtlu- ke fiel ein trübes oben im Schiff längst abgebruchtes Licht in die klägliche Kabine, in welcher ein Bett, ein Schrank, ein Sessel und der Mann knapp neben einander wie eingelagert standen. „Ich habe mich verirrt"", sagte Karl, „ich habe es während der Fahrt gar nicht so be- merkt, aber es ist ein schrecklich großes Schiff."" „Ja da haben Sie recht"", sagte der Mann mit einigem Stolz und hörte nicht auf an dem Schloß eines kleinen Koffers zu hantieren, den er mit beiden Händen immer wieder zu- drückte, um das Einschnappen des Riegels zu behor- chen. „Aber kommen Sie doch herein"", sagte der Mann weiter, „Sie werden doch nicht draußen stehn."" „Störe ich nicht?"" fragte Karl. „Ach wie werden Sie denn stö- ren."" „Sind Sie ein Deutscher?"" suchte sich Karl noch zu versichern, da er viel von den Gefahren gehört hatte, welche besonders von Irländern den Neuankömmlingen in Amerika drohen. „Bin ich, bin ich"", sagte der Mann. Karl zögerte noch. Da faßte unversehens der Mann die Türklinke und schob mit der Türe, die er rasch schloß, Karl zu sich herein. „Ich kann es nicht leiden, wenn man mir vom Gang hereinschaut"", sagte der Mann, der wie- der an seinem Koffer arbeitete. „Da lauf jeder vorbei und schaut herein, das soll der Zehnte aushalten."" „Aber der Gang ist doch ganz leer"", sagte Karl, der unbehag- lich an den Bettpfosten gequetscht dastand. „Ja jetzt"", sagte der Mann. „Es handelt sich doch um jetzt"", dachte Karl, „mit dem Mann ist schwer zu reden."" „Legen Sie sich doch aufs Bett, da haben Sie mehr Platz"", sagte der Mann. Karl kroch so gut es gieng hinein und lachte dabei laut über den ersten vergeblichen Versuch sich herüber zu schwingen. Kaum war er aber drin, rief er: „Gottes- willen, ich habe ja ganz an meinen Koffer vergessen."" Wo ist er denn?"" „Oben auf dem Deck, ein Bekannter gibt acht auf ihn. Wie heißt er nur?"" Und er zog aus einer Geheimtasche, die ihm seine Mutter für die Reise im Rockfutter angelegt hatte, eine Visitkarte. „Butter- baum, Franz Butterbaum."" „Haben Sie den Koffer sehr nötig?"" „Natürlich."" „Ja warum haben Sie ihn dann einem fremden Menschen gegeben?"" „Ich hatte meinen Regenschirm unten vergessen und bin gelaufen ihn zu holen, wollte aber den Koffer nicht mitschleppen. Dann habe ich mich auch noch verirrt."" „Sie sind allein? Ohne Begleitung?"" „Ja, allein."" Ich sollte mich vielleicht an diesen Mann halten, gieng es Karl durch den Kopf, wo finde ich gleich einen bessern Freund. „Und jetzt haben Sie auch noch den Koffer verloren. Vom Regenschirm rede ich gar nicht"", und der Mann setzte sich auf den Sessel, als habe Karls Sache jetzt einiges Interesse für ihn gewonnen. „Ich glaube aber, der Koffer ist noch nicht verloren."" „Glauben macht selig"", sagte der Mann und kratzte sich kräfig in seinem dunklen kurzen dichten Haar. „Auf dem Schiff wechseln mit den Hafenplätzen auch die Sitten, in Hamburg hätte Ihr Butterbaum den Koffer vielleicht bewacht, hier ist höchstwahrscheinlich schon von beiden keine Spur mehr."" „Da muß ich aber doch gleich hinaufschauen"", sagte Karl und sah sich um wie er herauskommen könnte. „Bleiben Sie nur"", sagte der Mann und stieß ihn mit einer Hand gegen die Brust geradezu rauh ins Bett zurück. „Warum denn?"" fragte Karl ärgerlich. „Weil es keinen Sinn hat"", sagte der Mann. „In einem kleinen Weilchen gehe ich auch, dann gehn wir zusammen. Entweder ist der Koffer gestohlen, dann ist keine Hilfe und Sie können ihm nachweinen bis an das Ende Ihrer Tage oder der Mensch bewacht ihn noch immer, dann ist er ein Dummkopf und soll weiter wachen oder er ist bloß ein ehrlicher Mensch und hat den Koffer stehn gelassen, dann werden wir ihn bis das Schiff ganz entleert ist, desto besser finden. Ebenso auch Ihren Regenschirm."" „Kennen Sie sich auf dem Schiff aus?"" fragte Karl mißtrauisch und es schien ihm, als hätte der sonst überzeugende Gedanke, daß auf dem leeren Schiff seine Sachen am besten zu finden sein wür- den, einen verborgenen Haken. „Ich bin doch Schiffs- heizer"", sagte der Mann. „Sie sind Schiffsheizer"", rief Karl freudig, als überstiege das alle Erwartungen, und sah den Elbogen aufgestützt den Mann näher an. „Gera- de vor der Kammer, wo ich mit den Slowacken geschla- fen habe, war eine Luke angebracht durch die man in den Maschinenraum sehen konnte."" „Ja dort habe ich gearbeitet"", sagte der Heizer. „Ich habe mich immer so für Technik interessiert"", sagte Karl, der in einem be- stimmten Gedankengang blieb, „und ich wäre sicher später Ingenieur geworden, wenn ich nicht nach Ameri- ka hätte fahren müssen."" „Warum haben Sie denn fahren müssen?"" „Ach was!"" sagte Karl und warf die ganze Geschichte mit der Hand weg. Dabei sah er lächelnd den Heizer an, als bitte er ihn selbst für das nicht Eingestan- dene um seine Nachsicht. „Es wird schon einen Grund gehabt haben"", sagte der Heizer und man wußte nicht recht, ob er damit die Erzählung dieses Grundes fordern oder abwehren wolle. „Jetzt könnte ich auch Heizer werden"", sagte Karl, „meinen Eltern ist es jetzt ganz gleichgiltig was ich werde."" „Meine Stelle wird frei"", sagte der Heizer, steckte im Vollbewußtsein dessen die Hände in die Hosentaschen und warf die Beine, die in faltigen, lederartigen, eisengrauen Hosen steckten, aufs Bett hin, um sie zu strecken. Karl mußte mehr an die Wand rücken. „Sie verlassen das Schiff?"" „Jawoll, wir marschieren heute ab."" „Warum denn? Gefällt es Ihnen nicht?"" „Ja, das sind so die Verhältnisse, es entscheidet nicht immer, ob es einem gefällt oder nicht. Übrigens haben Sie recht, es gefällt mir auch nicht. Sie denken wahrscheinlich nicht mit Entschlossenheit daran Heizer zu werden, aber gerade dann kann man es am leichtesten werden. Ich also rate Ihnen entschieden ab. Wenn Sie in Europa studieren wollten, warum wollen Sie es denn hier nicht. Die amerikanischen Universitäten sind ja unver- gleichlich besser."" „Das ist ja möglich"", sagte Karl, „aber ich habe ja fast kein Geld zum Studieren. Ich habe zwar von irgend jemandem gelesen, der bei Tag in einem Ge- schäf gearbeitet und in der Nacht studiert hat, bis er Doktor und ich glaube Bürgermeister wurde. Aber dazu gehört doch eine große Ausdauer, nicht? Ich fürchte, die fehlt mir. Außerdem war ich gar kein besonders guter Schüler, der Abschied von der Schule ist mir wirklich nicht schwer geworden. Und die Schulen hier sind viel- leicht noch strenger. Englisch kann ich fast gar nicht. Überhaupt ist man hier gegen Fremde so eingenommen, glaube ich."" „Haben Sie das auch schon erfahren? Na, dann ist gut. Dann sind Sie mein Mann. Sehn Sie, wir sind doch auf einem deutschen Schiff, es gehört der Hamburg Amerika Linie, warum sind wir nicht lauter Deutsche hier? Warum ist der Obermaschinist ein Ru- mäne? Er heißt Schubal. Das ist doch nicht zu glauben. Und dieser Lumpenhund schindet uns Deutsche auf ei- nem deutschen Schiff. Glauben Sie nicht"" – ihm gieng die Luf aus, er fackelte mit der Hand – „daß ich klage um zu klagen. Ich weiß daß Sie keinen Einfluß haben und selbst ein armes Bürschchen sind. Aber es ist zu arg."" Und er schlug auf den Tisch mehrmals hart mit der Faust und ließ kein Auge von ihr, während er schlug. „Ich habe doch schon auf so vielen Schiffen gedient"" – und er nannte zwanzig Namen hinter einander als sei es ein Wort, Karl wurde ganz wirr – „und habe mich aus- gezeichnet, bin belobt worden, war ein Arbeiter nach dem Geschmack meiner Kapitäne, sogar auf dem glei- chen Handelssegler war ich einige Jahre"" – er erhob sich als sei das der Höhepunkt seines Lebens – „und hier auf diesem Kasten, wo alles nach der Schnur eingerichtet ist, wo kein Witz erfordert wird – hier taug ich nichts, hier steh ich dem Schubal immer im Wege, bin ein Faulpelz, verdiene herausgeworfen zu werden und bekomme mei- nen Lohn aus Gnade. Verstehn Sie das? Ich nicht."" „Das dürfen Sie sich nicht gefallen lassen"", sagte Karl aufge- regt. Er hatte fast das Gefühl davon verloren, daß er auf dem unsichern Boden eines Schiffes an der Küste eines unbekannten Erdteils war, so heimisch war ihm hier auf dem Bett des Heizers zumute. „Waren Sie schon beim Kapitän? Haben Sie schon bei ihm Ihr Recht gesucht?"" Ach gehn Sie, gehn Sie lieber weg. Ich will Sie nicht hier haben. Sie hören nicht zu, was ich sage und geben mir Ratschläge. Wie soll ich denn zum Kapitän gehn."" Und müde setzte sich der Heizer wieder und legte das Gesicht in beide Hände. „Einen bessern Rat kann ich ihm nicht geben"", sagte sich Karl. Und er fand über- haupt, daß er lieber seinen Koffer hätte holen sollen, statt hier Ratschläge zu geben die ja nur für dumm ge- halten wurden. Als ihm der Vater den Koffer für immer übergeben hatte, hatte er im Scherz gefragt: Wie lange wirst du ihn haben? und jetzt war dieser teuere Koffer vielleicht schon im Ernst verloren. Der einzige Trost war noch, daß der Vater von seiner jetzigen Lage nicht das allergeringste erfahren konnte, selbst wenn er nachfor- schen sollte. Nur daß er bis Newyork gekommen war, konnte die Schiffsgesellschaf gerade noch sagen. Leid tat es aber Karl daß er die Sachen im Koffer noch kaum verwendet hatte, trotzdem er es beispielsweise längst nö- tig gehabt hätte, das Hemd zu wechseln. Da hatte er also am unrichtigen Ort gespart; jetzt wo er es gerade am Beginn seiner Laufahn nötig haben würde, rein geklei- det aufzutreten, würde er im schmutzigen Hemd er- scheinen müssen. Das waren schöne Aussichten. Sonst wäre der Verlust des Koffers nicht gar so arg gewesen, denn der Anzug, den er anhatte war sogar besser, als jener im Koffer, der eigentlich nur ein Notanzug war, den die Mutter noch knapp vor der Abreise hatte flicken müssen. Jetzt erinnerte er sich auch, daß im Koffer noch ein Stück Veroneser Salami war, die ihm die Mutter als Extragabe eingepackt hatte, von der er jedoch nur den kleinsten Teil hatte aufessen können, da er während der Fahrt ganz ohne Appetit gewesen war und die Suppe, die im Zwischendeck zur Verteilung kam, ihm reichlich genügt hatte. Jetzt hätte er aber die Wurst gern bei der Hand gehabt, um sie dem Heizer zu verehren. Denn solche Leute sind leicht gewonnen wenn man ihnen ir- gendeine Kleinigkeit zusteckt, das wußte Karl noch von seinem Vater her, welcher durch Cigarrenverteilung alle die niedrigem Angestellten gewann, mit denen er ge- schäflich zu tun hatte. Jetzt hatte Karl an Verschenkba- rem noch sein Geld bei sich und das wollte er, wenn er schon vielleicht den Koffer verloren haben sollte, vor- läufig nicht anrühren. Wieder kehrten seine Gedanken zum Koffer zurück und er konnte jetzt wirklich nicht einsehn, warum er den Koffer während der Fahrt so aufmerksam bewacht hatte, daß ihn die Wache fast den Schlaf gekostet hatte, wenn er jetzt diesen gleichen Kof- fer so leicht sich hatte wegnehmen lassen. Er erinnerte sich an die fünf Nächte, während derer er einen kleinen Slowacken, der zwei Schlafstellen links von ihm lag, un- ausgesetzt im Verdacht gehabt hatte, daß er es auf seinen Koffer abgesehen habe. Dieser Slowacke hatte nur dar- auf gelauert, daß Karl endlich von Schwäche befallen für einen Augenblick einnicke, damit er den Koffer mit ei- ner langen Stange, mit der er immer während des Tages spielte oder übte, zu sich hinüberziehen könne. Bei Tage sah dieser Slowacke genug unschuldig aus, aber kaum war die Nacht gekommen, erhob er sich von Zeit zu Zeit von seinem Lager und sah traurig zu Karls Koffer her- über. Karl konnte dies ganz deutlich erkennen, denn immer hatte hie und da jemand mit der Unruhe des Auswanderers ein Lichtchen angezündet, trotzdem dies nach der Schiffsordnung verboten war, und versuchte unverständliche Prospekte der Auswanderungsagentu- ren zu entziffern. War ein solches Licht in der Nähe, dann konnte Karl ein wenig eindämmern, war es aber in der Ferne oder war es dunkel, dann mußte er die Augen offenhalten. Diese Anstrengung hatte ihn recht er- schöpf. Und nun war sie vielleicht ganz umsonst gewe- sen. Dieser Butterbaum, wenn er ihn einmal irgendwo treffen sollte.","A young man, with whom he had briefly become acquainted during the journey, said in passing: ""So you don't feel like getting out yet?"" ""I'm done,"" said Karl, laughing at him and raised his head, out of high spirits and because he was a strong man boy was, the suitcase on his armpit. But as he looked over his acquaintance, who was already moving away with the others, waving his cane a little, he realized that he had forgotten his umbrella down in the ship. He quickly asked the acquaintance, who didn't seem very happy, for the kindness of waiting a moment by his suitcase, quickly surveyed the situation in order to find his way on his return, and hurried away. Down below, to his regret, he found a corridor that would have shortened his journey, blocked for the first time, which was probably due to the disembarkation of all the passengers, and he had to make his way through a myriad of small rooms, constantly turning corridors, short flights of stairs , who followed each other again and again, laboriously looking for an empty room with a deserted desk, until actually, as he had walked this path only once or twice and always in larger company, he was quite lost. In his helplessness and since he didn't meet anyone and only constantly heard the scuffling of thousands of human feet above him and from the distance like a breath noticed the last workings of the machine that had already been set, he started without thinking at any small door strike at which he faltered in his wandering. It's open,"" someone called from inside and Karl opened the door with an honest sigh of relief. ""Why are you banging on the door like that?"" asked a huge man, as soon as he looked at Karl. Through some skylight hatch, a dim light that had long been lost up in the ship fell into the pitiful cabin, in which a bed, a cupboard, an armchair, and the man stood next to each other as if stored away. ""I got lost,"" said Karl, ""I didn't really notice it during the voyage, but it's a terribly big ship."" ""Yes, you're right,"" said the man with some pride and kept fumbling with the lock of a small suitcase, which he kept squeezing shut with both hands to hear the bolt click come in,"" the man continued, ""you won't be standing outside."" ""Am I not disturbing you?"" asked Karl. ""Oh, how will you disturb me?"" ""Are you a German?"" Karl tried to reassure himself, since he had heard a great deal about the dangers that threatened the newcomers in America, especially from the Irish. ""I am, I am,"" said the man. Karl still hesitated. Suddenly the man grabbed the door handle and pushed Karl in with the door, which he quickly closed in the corridor,"" said the man, who was working on his suitcase again. ""Everybody run past and look in, the tenth should be able to handle that."" ""But the corridor is completely empty,"" said Karl, who was standing there uncomfortably squeezed against the bedpost. ""Yes, now,"" said the man. ""It's about now,"" thought Karl, ""it's difficult to talk to the man."" ""Lie down on the bed, you'll have more space there,"" said the man. Karl crawled in as best he could and laughed out loud at the first unsuccessful attempt to swing over. But no sooner was he inside than he called out, ""For God's sake, I forgot my suitcase."" Where is it then?"" ""Up on the deck, an acquaintance is keeping an eye on him. What's his name?"" And he pulled a business card out of a secret pocket that his mother had given him in the lining of his coat for the trip. ""Butterbaum, Franz Butterbaum."" ""Do you need the suitcase very much?"" ""Of course."" ""Yes, why did you give it to a stranger then?"" ""I forgot my umbrella downstairs and ran to get it, but didn't want to carry the suitcase with me. Then I got lost as well."" ""They are alone? Unaccompanied?"" ""Yes, alone."" Maybe I should stick to this man, Karl thought, where can I find a better friend soon? ""And now you've lost your suitcase, too. I'm not even talking about the umbrella,"" and the man sat down on the armchair, as if Karl's case had now aroused some interest for him. ""But I don't think the suitcase is lost yet."" ""Believing makes you happy,"" said the man, scratching his dark, short, thick hair vigorously. ""On the ship, the customs change with the port locations, in Hamburg your butter tree might have guarded the suitcase, here there is most likely no trace of either of them more."" ""But I have to look up there right away,"" said Karl and looked around to see how he could get out. ""Just stay,"" said the man and with a hand on his chest pushed him almost roughly back into the bed. ""Why?"" asked Karl angrily. ""Because it makes no sense,"" said the man. ""In a little while I'm going too, then we'll go together. Either the suitcase has been stolen, then there is no help and you can cry for it to the end of your days, or the person is still guarding it, then he is a fool and should keep watching, or he is just an honest person and has the suitcase standing left, then we will find him until the ship is completely empty, the better. Also your umbrella."" ""Do you know your way around the ship?"" Karl asked suspiciously and it seemed to him that the otherwise convincing thought that his belongings would be best found on an empty ship had a hidden catch. ""But I'm a ship's stoker,"" said the man. ""You're a ship's stoker,"" Karl exclaimed happily, as if that exceeded all expectations, and propped his elbow up and looked at the man more closely. ""Just in front of the room where I slept with the Slovaks, there was a hatch through which you could see the engine room."" ""Yes, that's where I worked,"" said the stoker. ""I've always been so interested in technology,"" said Karl, staying on a certain train of thought, ""and I would certainly have become an engineer later if I hadn't had to go to America."" ""Why did you have to drive?"" ""Oh, what!"" said Karl and threw away the whole story with his hand. He looked at the stoker with a smile, as if asking his indulgence for what he hadn't admitted. ""There must have been a reason,"" said the stoker, and one wasn't quite sure whether he wanted to demand or ward off the telling of this reason. ""Now I could become a stoker, too,"" said Karl, ""my parents are all set now no matter what I become."" ""My job is going to be vacant,"" said the stoker, consciously putting his hands in his pockets and throwing his legs, which were clad in wrinkled, leathery, iron-grey pants, onto the bed to stretch them. Karl had to move closer to the wall. ""You're leaving the ship?"" ""Yes, we're leaving today."" ""Why then? Don't you like it?"" ""Yes, that's the way things are, it doesn't always decide whether you like it or not. By the way, you're right, I don't like it either That's when it's easiest to do it. So I definitely advise against it. If you wanted to study in Europe, why not here. The American universities are incomparably better."" ""That's possible,"" said Karl, ""but I have almost no money to study. I've read about someone who worked in a shop by day and studied at night until he and I got a doctorate I think I became mayor. But that takes a lot of perseverance, doesn't it? I'm afraid I lack that. Besides, I wasn't a particularly good student, it really wasn't difficult for me to say goodbye. And the schools here are maybe even stricter. I can hardly speak English at all. In general, I think people are so taken with strangers here."" ""Have you experienced that too? Well then that's good. Then you are my man. Look, we're on a German ship, it belongs to the Hamburg America Line, why aren't we all German here? Why is the head machinist a Romanian? His name is Schubal. That's unbelievable. And this rascal dog abuses us Germans on a German ship. Don't think"" - he was running out of breath, he fiddled with his hand - ""that I'm complaining for the sake of complaining. I know that you have no influence and are a poor little fellow yourself. But it's too bad."" And he hit the table hard with his fist several times and didn't take his eyes off her while he was hitting. ""I've served on so many ships"" - and he said twenty names in a row as if it were one word, Karl became quite confused - ""and I've distinguished myself, I've been praised, I was a worker to the liking of my captains , I was even on the same merchant ship for a few years"" - he stood up as if this were the high point of his life - ""and here on this box, where everything is arranged according to the string, where no joke is required - here I am no good , here I always stand in the way of Schubal, am a slacker, deserve to be thrown out and get my reward from grace. Do you understand? I don't."" ""You mustn't put up with that,"" said Karl excitedly. He had almost lost the sense of being on the unsafe bottom of a ship on the shore of an unknown continent, so at home did he feel here on the stoker's bed. ""Have you been to the captain? Have you already sought your rights from him?"" Oh go, you'd better go away. I don't want you here. You don't listen to what I say and give me advice. How am I supposed to go to the captain?"" And tired, the stoker sat down again and put his face in his hands. ""I can't give him any better advice,"" Karl said to himself. And he actually thought that he should have fetched his suitcase instead of giving advice here that was only considered stupid. When his father handed over the suitcase for good, he had asked jokingly: ""How long will you have it? And now this expensive suitcase might already have been seriously lost. The only consolation was that my father could not find out the slightest bit about his current situation Even if he should investigate. The only thing the shipping company could say was that he had made it as far as New York. Karl was sorry, however, that he had hardly used the things in the suitcase, although he should have had it for a long time, for example ""To change his shirt. So he had saved in the wrong place; now that he would need to appear clean at the very beginning of his run, he would have to show up in a dirty shirt. That was a fine prospect . Otherwise the loss of the suitcase wouldn't have been so bad, because the suit he was wearing was even better than the one in the suitcase, which was actually just an emergency suit that his mother had had to mend just before leaving. Now he also remembered that there was still a piece of Veronese salami in the suitcase, which his mother had packed for him as an extra gift, of which he could only eat the smallest part, since he had lost his appetite during the journey and the soup , which was distributed between decks, had been more than enough for him. Now, however, he would have liked to have had the sausage to hand so that he could present it to the stoker. Because people like that are easily won over if you slip them a little something, Karl knew that from his father, who, by distributing cigars, got all the lowly employees with whom he had business dealings. Now Karl still had his money with him as a gift and he didn't want to touch it for the time being, even if he might have lost his suitcase. Again his thoughts returned to the suitcase and now he really couldn't see why he had watched the suitcase so carefully during the journey that the guard had almost cost him his sleep when he could now take this same suitcase away so easily to let. He remembered the five nights during which he had constantly suspected a little Slovak lying two bunks to his left of trying to steal his suitcase. This Slovak was just waiting for Karl to nod off for a moment, so that he could pull the suitcase over to him with a long pole, which he always played or practiced with during the day. During the day this Slovak looked innocent enough, but scarcely had the night come when he got up from his couch from time to time and looked sadly across at Karl's trunk. Karl could see this very clearly, because here and there someone with the restlessness of the emigrant had always lit a candle, although this was forbidden according to the ship's regulations, and tried to decipher incomprehensible prospectuses from the emigration agencies. If such a light was nearby, Karl could doze off a bit, but if it was far away or it was dark, he had to keep his eyes open. This effort had exhausted him quite a bit. And now it might have been for nothing. That butter tree, if he ever met him anywhere.","A young man with whom he had struck up a slight acquaintance during the crossing said to him in passing: ‘Well, don’t you want to get off yet?’ ‘I’m all ready,’ said Karl laughing to him, and in his exuberance and because he was a strong lad, he raised his suitcase on to his shoulder. But as he watched his acquaintance disappearing along with the others, swinging a cane, he realized that he had left his umbrella down in the ship. So he hurriedly asked his acquaintance, who seemed less than overjoyed about it, to be so good as to wait by his suitcase for a moment, took a quick look around for his subsequent orientation, and hurried off. Below deck, he found to his annoyance that a passage that would have considerably shortened the way for him was for the first time barred, probably something to do with the fact that all the passengers were disembarking, and so he was forced instead to make his way through numerous little rooms, along continually curving passages and down tiny flights of stairs, one after the other, and then through an empty room with an abandoned desk in it until, eventually, only ever having gone this way once or twice previously, and then in the company of others, he found that he was totally and utterly lost. Not knowing what to do, not seeing anyone, and hearing only the scraping of thousands of human feet overhead and the last, faraway wheezings of the engine, which had already been turned off, he began without thinking to knock at the little door to which he had come on his wanderings. ‘I’s open!’ came a voice from within, and Karl felt real relief as he opened the door. ‘Why are you banging about on the door like a madman?’ asked an enormous man, barely looking at Karl. Through some kind of overhead light-shaft, a dim light, long since used up in the higher reaches of the ship, fell into the wretched cabin, in which a bed, a wardrobe, a chair and the man were all standing close together, as though in storage. ‘I’ve lost my way,’ said Karl. ‘I never quite realized on the crossing what a terribly big ship this is.’ ‘Well, you’re right about that,’ said the man with some pride, and carried on tinkering with the lock of a small suitcase, repeatedly shutting it with both hands to listen to the sound of the lock as it snapped shut. ‘Why don’t you come in,’ the man went on, ‘don’t stand around outside.’ ‘Aren’t I bothering you?’ asked Karl. ‘Pah, how could you bother me?’ ‘Are you German?’ Karl asked to reassure himself, as he’d heard a lot about the dangers for new arrivals in America, especially coming from Irishmen. ‘ Yes, yes,’ said the man. Still Karl hesitated. Then the man abruptly grabbed the door handle, and pulling it to, swept Karl into the room with him. ‘I hate it when people stand in the corridor and watch me,’ said the man, going back to work on his suitcase, ‘the world and his wife go by outside peering in , it’s quite intolerable.’ ‘But the passage outside is completely deserted,’ said Karl, who was standing squeezed uncomfortably against the bedpost. ‘Yes, now,’ said the man. ‘But now is what matters,’ thought Karl. ‘ He is an unreasonable man.’ ‘Lie down on the bed, you’ll have more room that way,’ said the man. Karl awkwardly clambered on to the bed, and had to laugh out loud about his first vain attempt to mount it. No sooner was he on it, though, than he cried: ‘Oh God, I’ve quite forgotten all about my suitcase!’ ‘Where is it?’ ‘Up on deck, an acquaintance is keeping an eye on it for me. What was his name now?’ And from a secret pocket that his mother had sewn into the lining of his jacket for the crossing, he pulled a calling-card: ‘Butterbaum, Franz Butterbaum.’ ‘Is the suitcase important to you?’ ‘Of course.’ ‘Well then, so why did you give it to a stranger?’ ‘I forgot my umbrella down below and went to get it, but I didn’t want to lug my suitcase down with me. And now I’ve gone and gotten completely lost’ ‘Are you on your own? There’s no one with you?’ ‘Yes, I’m on my own.’ I should stay by this man, thought Karl, I may not find a better friend in a hurry. ‘ And now you’ve lost your suitcase. Not to mention the umbrella,’ and the man sat down on the chair, as though Karl’s predicament was beginning to interest him. ‘I don’t think the suitcase is lost yet.’ ‘Think all you like,’ said the man, and scratched vigorously at his short, thick, black hair. ‘But you should know the different ports have different morals. In Hamburg your man Butterbaum might have minded your suitcase for you, but over here, there’s probably no trace of either of them any more.’ ‘Then I’d better go back up right away,’ said Karl and tried to see how he might leave. ‘You’re staying put,’ said the man, and gave him a push in the chest, that sent him sprawling back on the bed. ‘ But why?’ asked Karl angrily. ‘There’s no point,’ said the man, ‘in a little while I’ll be going up myself, and we can go together. Either your suitcase will have been stolen and that’s too bad and you can mourn its loss till the end of your days, or else the fellow’s still minding it, in which case he’s a fool and he might as well go on minding it, or he’s an honest man and just left it there, and we’ll find it more easily when the ship’s emptied. Same thing with your umbrella.’ ‘Do you know your way around the ship?’ asked Karl suspiciously, and it seemed to him that the otherwise attractive idea that his belongings would be more easily found on the empty ship had some kind of hidden catch. ‘I’ m the ship’s stoker,’ said the man. ‘You’re the ship’s stoker,’ cried Karl joyfully, as though that surpassed all expectations, and propped himself up on his elbow to take a closer look at the man. ‘Just outside the room where I slept with the Slovak there was a little porthole, and through it we could see into the engine-room.’ ‘Yes, that’s where I was working,’ said the stoker. ‘I’ve always been terribly interested in machinery,’ said Karl, still following a particular line of thought, ‘ and I’m sure I would have become an engineer if I hadn’t had to go to America.’ ‘Why did you have to go to America?’ ‘Ah, never mind!’ said Karl, dismissing the whole story with a wave of his hand. And he smiled at the stoker, as though asking him to take a lenient view of whatever it was he hadn’t told him. ‘I expect there’s a good reason,’ said the stoker, and it was hard to tell whether he still wanted to hear it or not. ‘ And now I might as well become a stoker,’ said Karl. ‘My parents don’t care what becomes of me.’ ‘My job will be going,’ said the stoker, and coolly thrust his hands into his pockets and kicked out his legs, which were clad in rumpled, leather-like iron-grey trousers, on to the bed to stretch them. Karl was forced to move nearer to the wall. ‘You’re leaving the ship?’ ‘Yup, we’re off this very day.’ ‘But what for? Don’t you like it?’ ‘Well, it’s circumstances really , it’s not always whether you like something or not that matters. Anyway you’re right , I don’t like it. You’re probably not serious about saying you could become a stoker, but that’s precisely how you get to be one. I’d strongly advise you against it myself. If you were intending to study in Europe, why not study here. Universities in America are incomparably better.’ ‘That may be,’ said Karl, ‘but I can hardly afford to study. I did once read about someone who spent his days working in a business and his nights studying, and in the end he became a doctor and I think a burgomaster, but you need a lot of stamina for that, don’t you? I’m afraid I don’t have that. Besides, I was never especially good at school, and wasn’t at all sorry when I had to leave. Schools here are supposed to be even stricter. I hardly know any English. And there’s a lot of bias against foreigners here too, I believe.’ ‘Have you had experience of that too? That’s good. Then you’re the man for me. You see, this is a German ship, it belongs to the Hamburg America Line, everyone who works on it should be German. So then why is the senior engineer Rumanian? Schubal, his name is. It’s incredible. And that bastard bossing Germans around on a German ship. Don’t get the idea’ – he was out of breath, and his hands flapped – ‘don’t you believe that I’m complaining for the hell of it. I know you don’t have any influence, and you’re just a poor fellow yourself. But it’s intolerable.’ And he beat the table with his fist several times, not taking his eyes off it as he did so. ‘I’ve served on so many ships in my time’ – and here he reeled off a list of twenty names as if it was a single word, Karl felt quite giddy – ‘and with distinction, I was praised, I was a worker of the kind my captains liked, I even served on the same clipper for several years’ – he rose, as if that had been the high point of his life – ‘and here on this bathtub, where everything is done by rote, where they’ve no use for imagination – here I’m suddenly no good , here I’m always getting in Schubal’s way , I’m lazy, I deserve to get kicked out, they only pay me my wages out of the kindness of their hearts. Does that make any sense to you? Not me.’ ‘You mustn’t stand for that,’ said Karl in agitation. He had almost forgotten he was in the uncertain hold of a ship moored to the coast of an unknown continent, that’s how much he felt at home on the stoker’s bed. ‘Have you been to see the captain? Have you taken your case to him?’ ‘Ah leave off, forget it. I don’t want you here. You don’t listen to what I say, and then you start giving me advice. How can I go to the captain.’ And the stoker sat down again, exhausted, and buried his face in his hands. ‘But it’s the best advice I know,’ Karl said to himself. And it seemed to him that he would have done better to fetch his suitcase, instead of offering advice which was only ignored anyway. When his father had given the suitcase into his possession, he had mused in jest: I wonder how long you’ll manage to hang on to it for? And now that expensive suitcase might already be lost in earnest. His only consolation was the fact that his father couldn’t possibly learn about his present fix, even if he tried to make inquiries. The shipping company would only be able to confirm that he had reached New York safely. But Karl felt sad that there were things in the suitcase that he had hardly used, although he should have done, he should have changed his shirt for example, some time ago. He had tried to make false economies; now, at the beginning of his career, when he most needed to be in clean clothes, he would have to appear in a dirty shirt. Those were fine prospects. Apart from that, the loss of his suitcase wasn’t so serious, because the suit he was wearing was better than the one in the suitcase, which was really nothing better than a sort of emergency suit, which his mother had even had to mend just before his departure. Then he remembered there was a piece of Verona salami in the suitcase as well, which his mother had given him as a last-minute gift, but of which he had only been able to eat a tiny portion, since for the whole crossing he had had very little appetite and the soup that was doled out in the steerage had been plenty for him. Now, though, he would have liked to have had the salami handy, to make a present of it to the stoker, because his sort are easily won over by some small present or other. Karl knew that from the example of his father who won over all the junior employees he had to deal with by handing out cigars to them. Now the only thing Karl had left to give was his money, and if he had indeed already lost his suitcase, he wanted to leave that untouched for the moment. His thoughts returned to the suitcase, and now he really couldn’t understand why, having watched it so carefully for the whole crossing that his watchfulness had almost cost him his sleep, he had now permitted that same suitcase to be taken from him so simply. He recalled the five nights during which he had incessantly suspected the little Slovak, who was sleeping a couple of places to his left, of having intentions on his suitcase. That Slovak had just been waiting for Karl, finally, sapped by exhaustion, to drop off for one instant, so that he could pull the suitcase over to himself by means of a long rod which he spent his days endlessly playing or practising with. That Slovak looked innocent enough by day, but no sooner did night fall than he would get up time and again from his bed and cast sad looks across at Karl’s suitcase. Karl saw this quite clearly, someone, with the natural apprehensiveness of the emigrant, was forever lighting a little lamp somewhere, even though that was against the ship’s regulations, and trying by its light to decipher the incomprehensible pamphlets of the emigration agencies. If there happened to be one such light close by, then Karl would be able to snooze a little, but if it was some way off, or even more if it was dark, then he had to keep his eyes open. His efforts had exhausted him, and now it seemed they might have been in vain. That Butterbaum had better look out, if he should ever run into him somewhere.","In passing a young man whom he knew from the voyage said: “So you don’t feel like getting off yet?” “Oh, I’m ready all right,” said Karl with a laugh, and in his exuberance, sturdy lad that he was , he lifted his trunk up on his shoulders. But looking out over his acquaintance, who swung his walking stick several times as he set off with the other passengers, he realized that he had forgotten his umbrella below deck. Quickly he asked his acquaintance, who seemed not at all pleased, whether he would be so kind as to wait there for a moment with his trunk, surveyed the scene quickly so he could find his bearings on his return, and hurried off. Downstairs he was disappointed to find a passageway that would have certainly shortened his path blocked off for the first time, probably on account of all those disembarking passengers, and was obliged to make his way laboriously through numerous small rooms, corridors that constantly turned off, many short stairs in rapid succession and an empty room with an abandoned desk, until at last, having gone that way only once or twice and always in company, he had quite lost his way. In his uncertainty, not encountering a soul and hearing only the constant scraping of a thousand human feet above him, and from a distance like a last gasp the final workings of the engine being shut down, he began without further reflection to knock at random on a little door before which he had halted. “It’s open,” cried a voice from within and, sighing with genuine relief, Karl stepped into the cabin. “Why do you have to bang on the door like a madman?” a huge man asked, almost without looking at Karl. Through a skylight somewhere a dull light, already expended on the upper decks, fell into the miserable cabin, where a bed, a closet, a chair, and the man were packed side by side, as if in storage. “I’ve lost my way,” said Karl, “on the voyage over I never really noticed what a terribly big ship this is.” “Yes, you’re right,” the man said with a certain pride as he tinkered with the lock on a small suitcase, which he opened and closed continually with both hands, listening for the bolt to snap into place. “But do come in,” the man continued, “you’re hardly going to stand there like that.” “Am I not disturbing you?” Karl asked. “How could you disturb me?” “Are you a German?” Karl sought to assure himself, for he had heard a great deal about the dangers facing newcomers in America, especially from Irishmen. “Yes, yes,” said the man. Karl continued to hesitate. Suddenly the man seized the door handle and pulled Karl into the cabin along with the door, which he promptly shut. “I simply can’t stand having people stare in at me from the corridor,” the man said, toying with his trunk again. “Everyone who walks by looks in; who could possibly stand that?” “But the corridor is completely empty,” said Karl, who was pressed uncomfortably against the bedpost. “It is now,” said the man. When else but now? thought Karl. It’s not easy talking to this man. “Lie down on the bed, that’ll give you a bit more room,” said the man. Karl crawled in as best he could, laughing loudly at his initially futile attempt to swing himself onto the bed. No sooner was he lying down than he cried: “ Oh, my goodness, I forgot all about my trunk.” “Well, where is it?” “Up on deck, an acquaintance of mine is keeping an eye on it. Let me see, his name is . . . ?” From the secret pocket his mother had attached to the lining of his coat, Karl drew a visiting card: “Butterbaum, Franz Butterbaum.” “Do you really need the trunk?” “Of course I do.” “Then why did you give it to a stranger?” “I had forgotten my umbrella below deck, so I ran to get it, but didn’t want to drag along my trunk. And then I got lost.” “You’re alone? Unaccompanied?” “Yes, I’m alone.” Perhaps I should stick with this man—thought Karl—for where else could I find a better friend just now? “And you’ve lost your trunk too. Not to mention your umbrella,” and the man sat down on the chair as though he had begun to take an interest in Karl’s affair. “But I don’t believe that my trunk is lost.” “Blessed are those who believe,” said the man, giving his thick short dark hair a vigorous scratching. “People’s conduct on board ship varies from one port to the next; in Hamburg your friend Butterbaum might have looked after your trunk, but here both will probably disappear without a trace.” “Well, in that case I’ll have to check up on deck at once,” said Karl, looking around for a way out. “Stay,” the man said and, putting his hand on Karl’s chest, pushed him roughly back onto the bed. “But why?” asked Karl, who had become annoyed. “It makes no sense,” said the man. “I’ll be leaving in a moment, and we can go together. Either the trunk has been stolen, in which case it’s hopeless and you can moan about it till the end of your days, or that person is still looking after it, in which case he’s an idiot and should keep on looking after it, or else he’s just an honest man who has left the trunk there, and it’ll be easier to find if we wait till the ship has emptied out completely. The same goes for your umbrella.” “Do you know your way around the ship?” Karl asked suspiciously, for he believed there must be some hidden flaw in the otherwise convincing notion that his belongings could be more easily found when the ship was empty. “But I’m a stoker,” said the man. “You are a stoker,” Karl cried with delight, as if this announcement surpassed all his expectations, and propping up on his elbows, he took a closer look at the man. “One could see into the engine room through a hatch next to the cabin in which I slept in with the Slovaks.” “Yes, that’s where I worked,” said the stoker. “I’ve always been very interested in technology,” said Karl, following his own train of thought, “and would no doubt have eventually become an engineer if I hadn’t had to go away to America.” “But why did you have to go away?” “Ah well!” said Karl, dismissing the entire affair with a wave of his hand. At the same time he smiled at the stoker as though seeking indulgence concerning matters that he had not disclosed. “But there must have been a reason,” said the stoker, and one could not tell whether he was requesting an explanation or attempting to forestall one. “I too could become a stoker,” said Karl, “my parents no longer care what I do.” “There’ll be an opening for my job,” said the stoker, and basking in this knowledge, he put his hands in his trouser pockets and stretched out by swinging his legs, which were clad in creased leatherlike iron-gray trousers, onto the bed. Karl had to move closer to the wall. “You’re leaving ship?” “Oh yes, we’re marching off today.” “But why? Don’t you like it here?” “Well, that’s just how it is; one’s own preferences aren’t always taken into account. Besides, you’re right, I don’t like it here. In any case, you’re probably not completely set on becoming a stoker, though that’s actually when it’s most likely to happen. So I strongly advise against it. If you wanted to study in Europe, why wouldn’t you want to study here? The American universities are, of course, incomparably better.” “That may well be so,” said Karl, “but I’ve barely any money to pay for my studies. I once read about someone who worked for a business by day and studied at night till he became a doctor and then, I believe, a mayor. But that takes great perseverance, doesn’t it? And that’s something I’m afraid I lack. Besides, I wasn’t an especially good student, and it wasn’t that hard for me to leave school. And the schools over here may be even stricter. I know hardly any English. In any case people here are often very prejudiced against foreigners.” “So you’ve already run into this too? In that case everything is fine. Then you’re my man. You see, we’re on a German ship, it belongs to the Hamburg Amerika Line, so why aren’t all of us here Germans? Why is the chief machinist a Romanian? His name is Schubal. It’s really incredible. And that scoundrel mistreats us Germans on a German ship. Now I don’t want you to get the idea”—he was out of breath now and fanned himself with his hand—“that I’m complaining for the sake of complaining. I know you’ve no influence and are only a poor little fellow. But this is too awful.” And he pounded several times on the table, keeping his eyes on his fist as he did so. “I’ve served on so many ships”—he reeled off twenty names as if they were a single word; Karl became very confused—“made my mark, got praised, all of the captains greatly appreciated my work, and even spent several years serving on the same merchant vessel.” He stood up as if this were the high point in his life—“and here on this tub, where everything is kept on such a tight leash, where one may not even joke around—I’m useless, always get in Schubal’s way, am simply a lazybones who deserves to be thrown out, and am paid only out of pity. Can you understand that? I certainly can’t.” “You shouldn’t stand for it,” Karl said in an agitated voice. So at home did he feel on the stoker’s bed that he had almost lost the feeling that he stood on the uncertain ground of a ship moored off the coast of an unfamiliar continent. “Have you been to the captain? Have you sought to obtain your rights from him?” “Oh go away, just go away. I don’t want you here. You don’t listen to what I have to say and then try to give me advice. How could I possibly go to the captain?” And the stoker sat down wearily, burying his face in both hands. “I couldn’t have given him any better advice,” Karl said to himself. And it occurred to him that he should have fetched his trunk rather than remain here and make suggestions only to hear them dismissed as stupid. On entrusting him with the trunk, his father had asked him in jest: How long will you hang on to it? And now that expensive trunk was perhaps lost. The only consolation was that his father would not discover anything about his present circumstances, even if he were to make inquiries. All the shipping company could say was that he had reached New York. Karl did regret, though, that he had barely made use of the belongings in the suitcase, especially since he should have changed his shirt sometime ago. So he had been economizing in the wrong places; now, at the outset of his new career, precisely when he needed to appear in clean clothes, he would have to turn up in a dirty shirt. What wonderful prospects! Otherwise the loss of the trunk wouldn’t have been so bad, since the suit he wore was better than the one in the trunk, which was meant only for emergencies and had been patched by his mother shortly before he left. He remembered now that there was still a piece of Veronese salami in the trunk, which his mother had packed in as an extra present, but of which he had eaten only the tiniest portion, for he had not had much of an appetite during the voyage and the soup handed out in steerage had more than sufficed. He would have liked to get his hands on the sausage so that he could bequeath it to the stoker. For one could gain the confidence of such people quite easily, merely by slipping them a little something; Karl knew this from his father, who had gained the confidence of all the lower-ranking employees he dealt with by handing out cigars. All that remained for Karl to give away was a little money, but now that he had perhaps lost his trunk, he did not want to touch that for the moment. His thoughts returned to the trunk, and he could no longer understand why he had even bothered to keep such close watch over his trunk that he had barely slept, only to let somebody relieve him of it so easily. He recalled the five nights he had lain in bed always suspecting that a little Slovak two beds away had his eyes on the trunk. That Slovak had awaited the moment when Karl would at last succumb to weakness and doze off so that he would then be able to take the long stick, with which he had played or possibly practiced all day, and pull the trunk over to his bed. By day the Slovak looked fairly innocent, but when darkness fell he would rise occasionally from his bed and look over at Karl’s trunk with a mournful expression on his face. Karl could observe this very clearly, for there was always someone prey to an emigrant’s unease who would turn on a little light—even though the ship’s regulations expressly forbade this—and attempt to decipher the incomprehensible brochures put out by the emigration agencies. If there was such a light nearby, Karl could doze off for a while, but if it was some distance away or the room was dark, he had to keep his eyes open. These exertions had left him quite exhausted. And had perhaps been in vain. Woe betide that Butter-baum, should he ever run into him again!"
"„Das grenzt ja ans Wunderbare"", sagte Karl.","""That borders on the wonderful,"" said Karl.","‘It’s like a miracle,’ said Karl.","“Well, that’s almost miraculous,” said Karl."
"Vieles erinnerte Karl an seine Heimat und er wußte nicht, ob er gut daran tue, New-York zu verlassen und in das Innere des Landes zu gehn. In New-York war das Meer und zu jeder Zeit die Möglichkeit der Rückkehr in die Heimat. Und so blieb er stehn und sagte zu seinen beiden Begleitern, er habe doch wieder Lust in New York zu bleiben. Und als Delamarche ihn einfach wei- tertreiben wollte, ließ er sich nicht treiben und sagte, daß er doch wohl noch das Recht habe über sich zu entschei- den. Der Irländer mußte erst vermitteln und erklären, daß Butterford viel schöner als Newyork sei und beide mußten ihn noch sehr bitten, ehe er wieder weiter gieng. Und selbst dann wäre er noch nicht gegangen, wenn er sich nicht gesagt hätte, daß es für ihn vielleicht besser sei, an einen Ort zu kommen, wo die Möglichkeit der Rück- kehr in die Heimat keine so leichte sei. Gewiß werde er dort besser arbeiten und vorwärtskommen, da ihn keine unnützen Gedanken hindern werden.","Many things reminded Karl of his homeland and he didn't know whether he would do well to leave New York and go into the interior of the country. In New York there was the sea and at any time the possibility of returning home. And so he stopped and said to his two companions that he really wanted to stay in New York again. And when Delamarche simply wanted to push him further, he didn't let himself be pushed and said that he probably still had the right to decide about himself. The Irishman had first to mediate and explain that Butterford was much nicer than New York, and they both had to beg him before he went on again. And even then he would not have gone if he had not told himself that it might be better for him to go to a place where the possibility of returning home was not so easy. Certainly he will work better there and get ahead, since no useless thoughts will hinder him.","Many things reminded Karl of his home, and he wasn’t sure whether it was a good idea for him to leave New York and make for the interior.

When Delamarche tried to push him forward he refused to be pushed, and said he must have the right to determine what he did for himself. The Irishman had to intervene between them, and explain that Butterford was far more beautiful than New York, and they both had to plead with him before he agreed to go on.

"„Wir aber haben überdies den Herrn Kapitän in sei- nen Amtsgeschäfen, die sich sicher gerade bei der An- kunf in Newyork unglaublich häufen, so sehr schon behindert, daß es höchste Zeit für uns ist, das Schiff zu verlassen, um nicht zum Überfluß auch noch durch ir- gendwelche höchstunnötige Einmischung diese gering- fügige Zänkerei zweier Maschinisten zu einem Ereignis zu machen. Ich begreife Deine Handlungsweise lieber Neffe übrigens vollkommen, aber gerade das gibt mir das Recht Dich eilends von hier fortzuführen."" „Ich werde sofort ein Boot für Sie flott machen las- sen"", sagte der Kapitän, ohne zum Erstaunen Karls auch nur den kleinsten Einwand gegen die Worte des Onkels vorzubringen, die doch zweifellos als eine Selbstdemüti- gung des Onkels angesehen werden konnten. Der Ober- kassier eilte überstürzt zum Schreibtisch und telepho- nierte den Befehl des Kapitäns an den Bootsmeister.","""But we have already hindered the captain so much in his official business, which is sure to pile up incredibly when he arrives in New York, that it is high time for us to leave the ship, so as not to have too much also to make an event of this petty squabbling of two machinists by any highly unnecessary interference. By the way, I completely understand your actions, dear nephew, but that gives me the right to take you away from here in a hurry."" ""I'll get a boat ready for you right away,"" said the captain, without even the slightest bit, to Karl's astonishment To object to the uncle's words, which could undoubtedly be seen as self-humiliation on the part of the uncle. The chief cashier rushed to the desk and telephoned the captain's orders to the boatswain.","‘Moreover, we have kept the captain from his business for long enough, which must be particularly onerous at the moment of arrival in New York. It’s high time we left the ship, lest our completely unnecessary intervention may turn this trifling squabble between a couple of engineers into a major incident. I fully understand your behaviour, dear nephew, but that’s precisely what gives me the right to lead you swiftly from this place.’ ‘I’ll have them get a boat ready for you right away,’ said the captain, astonishing Karl by not offering the slightest objection to the uncle’s self-deprecating words. The chief cashier hurried over to the desk and telephoned the captain’s order to the boatswain.","“But we’ve already so hindered the captain in his official duties—which must surely mount incredibly once the ship reaches New York—that it’s high time for us to leave instead of intervening quite unnecessarily and thereby turning a trivial squabble between two machinists into a full-blown incident.

The chief bursar hurried over to the desk and telephoned the captain’s order to the boatswain."
"„Glauben Sie nicht"", sagte Karl und atmete den eigen- tümlich dumpfen Geruch ein, der vom Oberportier aus- gieng und den er erst hier, wo er so lange in seiner nächsten Nähe stand, bemerkte, „glauben Sie nicht"", sagte er, „daß ich vollständig in Ihrer Gewalt bin, ich kann ja schreien."" „Und ich kann Dir den Mund stop- fen"", sagte der Oberportier ebenso ruhig und schnell, wie er es wohl nötigenfalls auszuführen gedachte. „Und meinst Du denn wirklich, wenn man Deinetwegen her- einkommen sollte, es würde sich jemand finden der Dir Recht geben würde, mir dem Oberportier gegenüber. Du siehst also wohl den Unsinn Deiner Hoffnungen ein. Weißt Du, wie Du noch in der Uniform warst, da hast Du ja tatsächlich noch etwas beachtenswert ausgesehn, aber in diesem Anzug, der tatsächlich nur in Europa möglich ist."" Und er zerrte an den verschiedensten Stel- len des Anzugs, der jetzt allerdings, trotzdem er vor fünf Monaten noch fast neu gewesen war, abgenützt, faltig, vor allem aber fleckig war, was hauptsächlich auf die Rücksichtslosigkeit der Lifjungen zurückzuführen war, die jeden Tag, um den Saalboden dem allgemeinen Be- fehl gemäß, glatt und staubfrei zu erhalten, aus Faulheit keine eigentliche Reinigung vornahmen, sondern mit ir- gendeinem Öl den Boden sprengten und damit gleich- zeitig alle Kleider auf den Kleiderständern schändlich bespritzten. Nun konnte man seine Kleider aufeben, wo man wollte, immer fand sich einer, der gerade seine Kleider nicht bei der Hand hatte, dagegen die versteck- ten fremden Kleider mit Leichtigkeit fand und sich aus- borgte. Und womöglich war dieser eine gerade derjeni- ge, der an diesem Tage die Saalreinigung vorzunehmen hatte und der dann die Kleider nicht nur mit dem Öl bespritzte, sondern vollständig von oben bis unten be- goß. Nur Renell hatte seine kostbaren Kleider an irgend- einem geheimen Orte versteckt, von wo sie kaum jemals einer hervorgezogen hatte, zumal ja auch niemand viel- leicht aus Bosheit oder Geiz fremde Kleider sich aus- borgte, sondern aus bloßer Eile und Nachlässigkeit dort nahm, wo er sie fand. Aber selbst auf Renells Kleid war mitten auf dem Rücken ein kreisrunder rötlicher Ölfleck und in der Stadt hätte ein Kenner an diesem Fleck selbst in diesem eleganten jungen Mann den Lifjungen fest- stellen können.","""Don't you think so,"" said Karl and inhaled the strange, musty smell that emanated from the head porter and which he only noticed here, where he had stood in his immediate vicinity for so long, ""don't you think so,"" he said ""I'm completely in your power, I can scream."" ""And I can shut your mouth,"" said the head porter just as calmly and quickly as he thought he would if necessary. ""And do you really think that if someone should come in because of you, there would be someone who would agree with you, across from me, the head porter. So you see the nonsense of your hopes. Do you know when you were still in uniform, you actually looked a bit remarkable, but in this suit, which is actually only possible in Europe."" And he tugged at the most varied parts of the suit, this one of course , although it had been almost new five months ago, was worn, wrinkled, but above all stained, which was mainly due to the recklessness of the Lifjungen, who every day, according to the general order, made the hall floor smooth and dust-free because of laziness they didn't actually clean it, but sprinkled the floor with some kind of oil and at the same time splattered all the clothes on the clothes racks didn't have clothes at hand, but easily found the hidden stranger's clothes and borrowed them, and maybe this one was the one that day e had to clean the hall and then not only spattered the clothes with the oil, but poured it completely from top to bottom. Only Renell had hidden his precious clothes in some secret place from which nobody had ever pulled them out, especially since no one borrowed someone else's clothes, perhaps out of malice or greed, but took them there out of sheer haste and carelessness. where he found her. But even on Renell's dress there was a reddish circular oil stain in the middle of the back, and in the city a connoisseur could have spotted the Lifjungen even in this elegant young man by that stain.","‘Don’t imagine,’ said Karl, and breathed in the strangely musty smell that emanated from the Head Porter, and only noticed for the first time now that he had been standing so close to him for so long, ‘don’t imagine’, he said, ‘that I am completely in your power, I can scream.’ ‘And I can gag you,’ said the Head Porter, as calmly and quietly as he would gag him, if it ever came to that. ‘And do you really think, if anyone should come in on your account, that he would back your version against the Head Porter’s. You must concede your hopes are nonsensical. You know, when you were still in uniform, you had something vaguely impressive about you, but in this suit, which has Europe written all over it.’ And he tugged at various bits of the suit, which indeed, although it had been almost new five months ago, was now worn, creased, and above all stained, which was largely to be attributed to the ruthlessness of the lift-boys, who every day, under instruction to keep the floor of the dormitory clean and free of dust, undertook no proper cleaning out of laziness, but merely squirted a kind of oil over the floor, which did terrible damage to all the clothes in the clothes stands. You could keep your clothes wherever you liked, there would always be someone who happened not to have his own to hand, but was easily able to find those that someone else had hidden, and borrow them for himself. And he might be one of the very ones who had to clean the room that day, and so the clothes wouldn’t just get the odd squirt of oil on them, but a veritable dunking from top to bottom. Only Renell had managed to keep his exquisite wardrobe in some secret place where hardly anyone had managed to find them, especially as it appeared people didn’t borrow out of malice or greed, but just helped themselves from haste and negligence. But even Renell’s jacket had a perfectly round reddish oil stain in the middle of the back, by which an expert in the town might have identified even that elegant young man as a lift-boy.","“Don’t imagine,” said Karl, inhaling the musty odor wafting over from the head porter, which he had only just noticed, even though he had been standing so close to him, “don’t imagine,” he said, “that I’m entirely at your mercy, for I can scream.” “And I can stuff your mouth,” said the head porter, just as calmly and as quickly as he might well intend to carry out that threat if necessary. “And do you really believe that if any of those people came in here on account of you, even one of them would side with you, as opposed to me, the head porter. So you can surely see that your hopes are futile. You know, when you were still wearing your uniform, you looked reasonably presentable, but the same cannot be said for you now in that suit, which would be presentable only in Europe.” And he tugged at various parts of the suit, which, though it had been almost new five months ago, was now worn, creased, and above all stained, mostly owing to the carelessness of the lift boys, who in their laziness had responded to the general order that the dormitory floor be kept smooth and free of dust, not by undertaking any real cleaning, but simply by sprinkling some kind of oil on the floor every day, managing to leave dreadful splashes on all of the clothes on the clothes stands. Well, wherever one put one’s clothes, there was always someone around who did not have his own clothes at hand and easily found a few concealed clothes belonging to someone else and borrowed them. And one of the boys entrusted with the task of cleaning the dormitory might not simply sprinkle oil on his clothes but smear them from top to bottom. Renell alone had managed to find for his expensive clothes a secret hiding place, where they had been left virtually undisturbed; the lift boys simply took clothes wherever they found them, for no one borrowed anyone else’s clothes out of, say, malice or greed but merely in haste and out of carelessness. But even on Renell’s outfit there was a circular reddish oil stain, right in the middle of the back, and thanks to that stain any knowledgeable city dweller could still have recognized traces of the lift boy."
"„Die Zeit drängt schon"", sagte sich Karl, „aber ohne alle zu beleidigen kann ich nichts tun. Ich kann doch jetzt den Onkel nicht verlassen, nachdem er mich kaum wiedergefunden hat. Der Kapitän ist zwar höflich, aber das ist auch alles. Bei der Disciplin hört seine Höflich- keit auf, und der Onkel hat ihm sicher aus der Seele gesprochen. Mit Schubal will ich nicht reden, es tut mir sogar leid, daß ich ihm die Hand gereicht habe. Und alle andern Leute hier sind Spreu.""","""Time is of the essence,"" Karl said to himself, ""but I can't do anything without insulting everyone. I can't leave my uncle now, since he's hardly found me again. The captain is polite, but that's all. His politeness ends at discipline, and the uncle must have spoken from his heart. I don't want to talk to Schubal, I'm even sorry that I shook his hand. And all the other people here are chaff. ""","‘Time is pressing,’ Karl said to himself, ‘but without offending them all there is nothing I can do. I can’t leave my uncle who’s only just found me. The captain is being polite, but really nothing more. When it’s a matter of discipline, his kindness will come to an end , I’m sure uncle was right about that. I don’t want to talk to Schubal, I’m even sorry I shook hands with him. And everyone else here is just chaff.’","“Time is running out,” Karl said to himself, “but I cannot do anything without insulting almost everyone. After all, I can’t leave my uncle, who has only just found me. The captain is polite, but that’s about it. Once this becomes a disciplinary matter, he will cease being polite, and Uncle must have been expressing the captain’s sentiments also. I don’t want to talk to Schubal and even regret that I shook hands with him. And the rest of the people here are nothing but chaff.”"
"Es gab aber auch lustigere Zeiten in Teresens Zim- mer. Gleich bei seinem ersten Besuch hatte Karl dort ein Lehrbuch der kaufmännischen Korrespondenz liegen gesehn und auf seine Bitte geborgt erhalten. Es wurde gleichzeitig besprochen, daß Karl die im Buch enthal- tenen Aufgaben machen und Teresen, die das Buch, soweit es für ihre kleinen Arbeiten nötig war, schon durchstudiert hatte, zur Durchsicht vorlegen solle. Nun lag Karl ganze Nächte lang, Watte in den Ohren, unten auf seinem Bett im Schlafsaal, der Abwechslung halber in allen möglichen Lagen, las im Buch und kritzelte die Aufgaben in ein Hefchen mit einer Füllfeder, die ihm die Oberköchin zur Belohnung dafür geschenkt hatte, daß er für sie ein großes Inventurverzeichnis sehr prak- tisch angelegt und rein ausgeführt hatte. Es gelang ihm die meisten Störungen der andern Jungen dadurch zum Guten zu wenden, daß er sich von ihnen immer kleine Ratschläge in der englischen Sprache geben ließ bis sie dessen müde wurden und ihn in Ruhe ließen. Of staun- te er, wie die andern mit ihrer gegenwärtigen Lage ganz ausgesöhnt waren, ihren provisorischen Charakter – äl- tere als zwanzigjährige Lifjungen wurden nicht gedul- det – gar nicht fühlten, die Notwendigkeit einer Ent- scheidung über ihren künfigen Beruf nicht einsahen und trotz Karls Beispiel nichts anderes lasen, als höch- stens Detektivgeschichten, die in schmutzigen Fetzen von Bett zu Bett gereicht wurden.","But there were also funnier times in Teresen's room. On his first visit, Karl saw a textbook on commercial correspondence lying there and, at his request, had it borrowed. At the same time, it was discussed that Karl should do the problems in the book and that Teresen, who had already studied the book to the extent that it was necessary for her little work, should show it to Teresen for review. Now Karl lay all night long, cotton in his ears, down on his bed in the dormitory, in all sorts of positions for the sake of variety, read the book and scribbled the tasks in a notebook with a fountain pen that the head cook had given him as a reward that he had drawn up a large inventory for her in a very practical way and had carried it out cleanly. He was able to turn most of the other boys' troubles to good by letting them give him little bits of advice in English until they got tired and left him alone. He was often amazed at how the others were completely reconciled to their present situation, did not feel their provisional character at all - older than twenty-year-old Lifjungen were not tolerated - did not see the necessity of a decision about their future profession and despite Karl's example, they read nothing but detective stories, which were passed from bed to bed in dirty rags.","But there were happier times in Therese’s room as well. On his very first visit there, Karl had seen a manual of business correspondence lying there, and had asked to borrow it. It was then arranged that Karl would do the exercises in the book and take them for approval to Therese, who had already studied the book for what was relevant to her own little tasks. Now Karl would spend whole nights with cotton wool in his ears, downstairs on his bed in the dormitory, in all possible positions for variety, reading the book, and scribbling out exercises in a little notebook with a fountain pen the Head Cook had given him as a reward for organizing one of her large inventories in a tidy and practical way. He was able to turn the interruptions from the other boys to good account, by asking them for little English tips, until they got bored and left him alone. It often surprised him how reconciled they were to their present position, seemingly oblivious to its provisional nature – there were no lift-boys older than twenty at the hotel – and didn’t see the need for a decision about any future employment, and, in spite of Karl’s example, read nothing but detective stories at best, tattered copies of which were passed from bed to bed.","However, there were also merrier occasions in Therese’s room. On his first visit Karl had seen a manual for business correspondence lying about and had requested and borrowed it. At the same time they agreed that Karl should complete the exercises in the book and hand them to Therese; she had already studied the book as much as was required for her minor duties. Karl then spent entire nights lying awake in his dormitory bed, his ears stuffed with cotton wool, trying out every conceivable position for the sake of diversion as he read the book and with a fountain pen jotted down the exercises in a little notebook—a present from the head cook to thank him for having devised and neatly carried out a large inventory that had turned out to be very practical. Whenever he was disturbed by the other youths, he usually managed to turn the situation around by asking them continually for tips about the English language until they grew tired and left him in peace. Often he marveled at how the other youths were completely reconciled to their present situation; they could not even sense how temporary it was—no lift boys older than twenty years of age were permitted—failed to recognize the necessity of making a decision about their future profession, and in spite of the example set by Karl, read only detective stories that got passed around from bed to bed in dirty tatters."
"„Aber"", rief Robinson, „warum sollte denn das nicht auch für Dich gelten? Selbstverständlich gilt es auch für Dich. Warte hier nur ruhig mit mir, bis es läutet. Dann kannst Du ja versuchen, ob Du wegkommst.""","""But,"" cried Robinson, ""why shouldn't that also apply to you? Of course it also applies to you. Just wait here with me until the bell rings. Then you can try to get away.""","‘But’, exclaimed Robinson, ‘why shouldn’t it apply to you too? Of course it applies to you as well. Stay here quietly with me, until it rings. Then you can see if you can get away.’","“Why not,” cried Robinson, “why shouldn’t it be true for you too? Of course it applies to you. Just wait quietly until the bell rings. And then you can try to get away.”"
"„Mein lieber Neffe ist nun von seinen Eltern – sagen wir nur das Wort, das die Sache auch wirklich bezeich- net – einfach beiseitegeschaf worden, wie man eine Katze vor die Tür wirf, wenn sie ärgert.

"„Ja"", sagte Robinson, „das konnte niemand voraus- sehn."" Und ehe er weitererzählte, sagte er noch: „auf Dein Wohl, lieber Roßmann"" und nahm einen langen Zug aus der Parfumflasche. „Wir waren ja damals wie Du uns so gemein hast sitzen lassen, sehr schlecht daran. Arbeit konnten wir an den ersten Tagen keine bekom- men, Delamarche übrigens wollte keine Arbeit, er hätte sie schon bekommen, sondern schickte nur immer mich auf Suche und ich habe kein Glück. Er hat sich nur so herumgetrieben, aber es war schon fast Abend, da hatte er nur ein Damenportemonnaie mitgebracht, es war zwar sehr schön, aus Perlen, jetzt hat er es der Brunelda geschenkt, aber es war fast nichts darin. Dann sagte er wir sollten in die Wohnungen betteln gehn, bei dieser Gelegenheit kann man natürlich manches Brauchbare finden, wir sind also betteln gegangen und ich habe, damit es besser aussieht, vor den Wohnungstüren gesun- gen. Und wie schon Delamarche immer Glück hat, sind wir nur vor der zweiten Wohnung gestanden, einer sehr reichen Wohnung im Parterre, und haben an der Tür der Köchin und dem Diener etwas vorgesungen, da kommt die Dame, der diese Wohnung gehört, eben Brunelda die Treppe hinauf. Sie war vielleicht zu stark geschnürt und konnte die paar Stufen gar nicht heraufommen. Aber wie schön sie ausgesehn hat, Roßmann! Sie hat ein ganz weißes Kleid und einen roten Sonnenschirm gehabt. Zum Ablecken war sie. Zum Austrinken war sie. Ach Gott, ach Gott war sie schön. So ein Frauenzimmer! Nein sag mir nur wie kann es so ein Frauenzimmer ge- ben? Natürlich ist das Mädchen und der Diener gleich ihr entgegengelaufen und haben sie fast hinaufgetragen. Wir sind rechts und links von der Tür gestanden und haben salutiert, das macht man hier so. Sie ist ein wenig stehn geblieben, weil sie noch immer nicht genug Atem hatte und nun weiß ich nicht, wie das eigentlich gesche- hen ist, ich war durch das Hungern nicht ganz bei Ver- stand und sie war eben in der Nähe noch schöner und riesig breit und infolge eines besondern Mieders, ich kann es Dir dann im Kasten zeigen, überall so fest – kurz, ich habe sie ein bißchen hinten angerührt, aber ganz leicht weißt Du, nur so angerührt. Natürlich kann man das nicht dulden, daß ein Bettler eine reiche Dame anrührt. Es war ja fast keine Berührung, aber schließlich war es eben doch eine Berührung. Wer weiß, wie schlimm das ausgefallen wäre, wenn mir nicht Dela- marche sofort eine Ohrfeige gegeben hätte und zwar eine solche Ohrfeige, daß ich sofort meine beiden Hände für die Wange brauchte.""","""Yes,"" said Robinson, ""no one could have foreseen that."" And before he continued, he said: “Your health, dear Rossmann” and took a long drag from the perfume bottle Days didn't get any, Delamarche by the way didn't want any work, he would have gotten it already, he just kept sending me out looking and I'm not lucky.He was just hanging around, but it was almost evening when he only had one Brought a lady's purse, it was very nice, made of pearls, now he gave it to Brunelda, but there was almost nothing in it. Then he said we should go begging in the apartments, of course you can find a lot of useful things on this occasion, we are so I went begging and I sang in front of the apartment doors to make it look better. And as Delamarche is always lucky, we only stood in front of the second apartment, a very rich apartment on the ground floor, and we sang at the Singing something to the cook and the servant at the door, Brunelda, the lady who owns this apartment, is coming up the stairs. Maybe she was laced too tight and couldn't even get up the few steps. But how beautiful she looked, Rossmann! She had an all white dress and a red parasol. She was lickable. She was to be drunk. Oh god, oh god she was beautiful. Such a woman! No just tell me how can there be such a woman? Of course, the girl and the servant immediately ran to meet her and almost carried her upstairs. We stood to the right and left of the door and saluted, that's how they do it here. She stopped for a bit because she still didn't have enough breath and now I don't know how that actually happened, I wasn't quite sane because of the hunger and she was even more beautiful and beautiful nearby enormously wide and because of a special bodice, I can then show it to you in the box, so tight all over – in short, I touched her a little from behind, but you know, very lightly, just touched. Of course one cannot tolerate a beggar touching a rich lady. It wasn't almost a touch, but it was a touch after all. Who knows how bad it would have been if Delamarche hadn't slapped me straight away, and a slap so hard that I immediately needed both my hands to cup my cheek.""","‘Yes,’ said Robinson, ‘who could have predicted it.’ And before he resumed his tale, he said: ‘Your health, my dear Rossmann,’ and he took a long pull from the perfume bottle. ‘Back then when you ditched us so meanly, we were in a bad way. In the first few days we couldn’t find any work, that is Delamarche didn’t want to work, he would have found something I’m sure, but he just sent me off to look, and I’m unlucky like that. He just hung around, but when it was almost dark he brought back a ladies’ purse, it was very pretty, beads, he’s given it to Brunelda now, but there wasn’t much in it. Then he said we ought to go and beg in people’s apartments, that way we might come across a few useful items, so we went begging, and to make a better impression , I sang on people’s doorsteps. And, Delamarche is such a lucky devil, we were on our second doorstep, a wealthy ground-floor apartment, singing to a cook and a butler, and then who should come up the stairs but the lady the flat belongs to, Brunelda in fact. Maybe her corset was too tight, and she couldn’t manage the few steps. But she was so beautiful, Rossmann! She had a white dress and a red parasol. I could have licked her all over. I could have gobbled her up. God, God she was beautiful. What a woman! No, tell me how can such a woman be allowed to exist? Of course the butler and the girl ran up to her and all but carried her up the stairs. We stood either side of the door and saluted, that’s what they do here. She stopped awhile, she still hadn’t got her breath, and I can’t remember how it happened exactly , maybe I’d had so little to eat that it was starting to affect my judgement, and close up she was still more beautiful and enormous and wide and, because of a special corset she had on, I can show you in the chest , she was so firm all over – well, I just brushed against her behind, you know, ever so gently. Of course that’s not permissible, a beggar touching a rich lady. It almost wasn’t a touch at all, but I suppose in the end it sort of was. Who knows what consequences it might have had, if Delamarche hadn’t slapped me right away, and slapped me so hard that both my hands flew up to my cheek.’","“Yes,” said Robinson, “nobody could have predicted this.” And before continuing with his story, he added, “Here’s to your health, my dear Rossmann,” and took a long sip from his perfume bottle. “Well, when you were so nasty as to leave us in the lurch, things were going badly for us. We couldn’t find any work for the first few days; besides, Delamarche didn’t want to find any work; he would have found some if he’d made an effort, but he always sent me out on my own instead, and I never have any luck. All day he simply knocked about, then it was almost nighttime, and all he brought back was a lady’s purse; though it was very beautiful, made of pearls, he’s since given it to Brunelda as a present—there was next to nothing in it. Then he said we should go begging in the apartments, one can come up with some useful items on such occasions, so we went begging, and I sang at the apartment doors so as to make a favorable impression. And since Delamarche is always so lucky, we had gone no farther than the door of the second apartment, where we sang some little ditty for the cook and the servant, when the lady who owns this apartment, in other words, Brunelda, comes up the stairs. Maybe she was a little too tightly laced, in any case she couldn’t climb up the last few steps. But she looked so beautiful, Rossmann! She wore an absolutely white dress, with a red parasol. She was so lickable! So drinkable! Oh God, oh God, how beautiful she was. What a woman! But tell me, how can such a woman even exist? Of course, the girl and the servant ran over and almost carried her upstairs. We stood right and left by the door and saluted, that’s how we do it here. She stopped for a moment, for she was still out of breath, and I don’t really know how this happened, but I was so hungry I wasn’t in my right mind, and well, she was even more beautiful up close, enormously broad, and thanks to her special corset, which I can show you in the drawer inside, so firm all over—in any case, to cut a long story short, I did touch her a little from behind, but, well, only very lightly, I barely even touched her. And of course having a beggar touch a rich lady is something that simply cannot be tolerated. There was really almost no touching, but in the end there was a little contact. Who knows how badly all of this would have turned out if Delamarche hadn’t given me such a hard slap in the face that I needed both hands for my cheeks.”"
"Dann meldete er sich bei jenem Oberkellner unter dessen Befehl er stehen sollte, einem schlanken schönen Mann mit großer Nase, der wohl schon in den vierziger Jahren stehen konnte. Er hatte keine Zeit sich auch nur auf das geringste Gespräch einzulassen und läutete bloß einen Lifjungen herbei, zufällig gerade jenen, den Karl gestern gesehen hatte. Der Oberkellner nannte ihn nur bei seinem Taufnamen Giacomo, was Karl erst später erfuhr, denn in der englischen Aussprache war der Na- me nicht zu erkennen. Dieser Junge bekam nun den Aufrag Karl das für den Lifdienst Notwendige zu zei- gen, aber er war so scheu und eilig, daß Karl von ihm, so wenig auch im Grunde zu zeigen war, kaum dieses We- nige erfahren konnte. Sicher war Giacomo auch deshalb verärgert, weil er den Lifdienst offenbar Karls halber verlassen mußte und den Zimmermädchen zur Hilfelei- stung zugeteilt war, was ihm nach bestimmten Erfah- rungen die er aber verschwieg, entehrend vorkam. Ent- täuscht war Karl vor allem dadurch, daß ein Lifjunge mit der Maschinerie des Aufzugs nur insoferne etwas zu tun hatte, als er ihn durch einen einfachen Druck auf den Knopf in Bewegung setzte, während für Reparaturen am Triebwerk derartig ausschließlich die Maschinisten des Hotels verwendet wurden, daß z. B. Giacomo trotz halbjährigen Dienstes beim Lif weder das Triebwerk im Keller, noch die Maschinerie im Innern des Aufzugs mit eigenen Augen gesehen hatte, trotzdem ihn dies, wie er ausdrücklich sagte, sehr gefreut hätte. Überhaupt war es ein einförmiger Dienst und wegen der zwölfstündigen Arbeitszeit, abwechselnd bei Tag und Nacht, so anstren- gend, daß er nach Giacomos Angaben überhaupt nicht auszuhalten war, wenn man nicht minutenweise im Ste- hen schlafen konnte. Karl sagte hiezu nichts, aber er begriff wohl, daß gerade diese Kunst Giacomo die Stelle gekostet hatte.","Then he reported to the head waiter under whose command he was supposed to be, a slender handsome man with a big nose, who could probably stand in his forties. He didn't have time to engage in even the slightest conversation and just rang for a Lifjungen, who just happened to be the one Karl had seen yesterday. The head waiter only called him by his baptismal name Giacomo, which Karl found out later because the name was not recognizable in the English pronunciation. This boy was now given the task of showing Karl what was necessary for the lift service, but he was so shy and in a hurry that Karl could hardly find out this little from him, even though there was actually little to show. Certainly Giacomo was also annoyed because he apparently had to leave the lift service because of Karl and was assigned to help out with the chambermaids, which he found disgraceful after certain experiences which he didn't mention. Karl was particularly disappointed that a lift boy only had anything to do with the machinery of the elevator insofar as he could set it in motion by simply pressing a button, while repairs to the engine of this kind were exclusively used by the hotel's mechanics were that e.g. B. Giacomo, despite working for the lift for six months, had neither seen the engine in the basement nor the machinery inside the elevator with his own eyes, although, as he expressly said, this would have made him very happy. In general, it was a monotonous shift and because of the twelve-hour working day, alternating day and night, it was so strenuous that, according to Giacomo, it was unbearable if you couldn't sleep for a few minutes standing up. Karl said nothing about this, but he understood well that it was precisely this art that had cost Giacomo the job.","Then he reported to the Head Waiter under whom he was to serve, a slim, handsome man with a big nose, who was probably already in his forties. He had no time for any conversation whatsoever, and merely rang for a lift-boy, it happened to be the very one Karl had seen the day before. The Head Waiter called him by his christian name, Giacomo, as Karl only learned later, because the name in its English pronunciation was unrecognizable. That boy was given the task of showing Karl the essentials of lift work but he was so bashful and so hasty, that, though there was little to learn, Karl didn’t even learn that. Giacomo was probably annoyed besides at having to leave the lift service to make way for Karl, and to be assigned to helping the chambermaids, which seemed to him, on the basis of some experiences he didn’t care to divulge, dishonourable. It came as a particular disappointment to Karl that the lift-boy’s only contact with the machinery was the simple pressing of a button, whereas for any repairs to the mechanism, the hotel’s team of engineers were exclusively responsible, so that Giacomo for instance, after six months on the lifts, had not seen the motor in the basement or the machinery inside the lift with his own eyes, even though he would have liked to very much, as he stressed. All in all the work was monotonous, and because of the twelve-hour shifts that alternated between day and night, it was so exhausting that according to Giacomo’s reports it was completely unendurable without the odd catnap on one’s feet. Karl said nothing to this, but it was clear to him that it was this skill of Giacomo’s that had cost him his job.","Then he reported to the head waiter, under whose command he was supposed to serve, a thin handsome man with a large nose who was probably already in his forties. He had no time to engage in even the briefest conversation and simply rang for a lift boy, who happened to be the very one that Karl had seen the previous day. The head waiter addressed him only by his first name, Giacomo, as Karl discovered only later, for the way his name was pronounced in English made it unrecognizable. This youth was now instructed to show Karl what he needed to know about the lift service, yet he was so timid and hasty that Karl couldn’t even grasp the little that needed to be shown. Besides, Giacomo was probably annoyed, for he had had to leave the lift service on account of Karl and had been given the task of assisting the chambermaids, which, after certain experiences that he would not divulge, he considered dishonorable. Karl was especially disappointed to learn that the only contact a lift boy had with the elevator machinery was when he pushed a button to set it in motion, and that the hotel’s machinists were always called whenever the engine needed to be repaired; for instance, although Giacomo had served at the lift for six months, he had never set eyes on the engine in the cellar, or on the machinery inside the elevator, even though, as he explicitly said, he would have greatly enjoyed doing so. Besides, the work itself was monotonous and, because of the twelve-hour shift and the alternating day and night shifts, so exhausting that, from what Giacomo said, it would have been intolerable if it had not been possible to catch a few minutes’ sleep as one stood there. Though Karl said nothing, he was well aware that this very trick had cost Giacomo his job."
"Er trat einen Schritt zurück und stand nun gleich weit von Herrn Pollunder und von Herrn Green entfernt. Wollten Sie ihm nicht etwas sagen?"" fragte Herr Pol- lunder Herrn Green und faßte wie bittend Herrn Greens Hand. „Ich wüßte nichts, was ich ihm sagen sollte?"" sagte Herr Green, der endlich einen Brief aus seiner Ta- sche gezogen und vor sich auf den Tisch gelegt hatte. Es ist recht lobenswert, daß er zu seinem Onkel zu- rückkehren will und nach menschlicher Voraussicht sollte man glauben, daß er dem Onkel eine besondere Freude damit machen wird. Es müßte denn sein, daß er durch seine Unfolgsamkeit den Onkel schon allzu böse gemacht hat, was ja auch möglich ist. Dann allerdings wäre es besser, er bliebe hier. Es ist eben schwer etwas bestimmtes zu sagen, wir sind zwar beide Freunde des Onkels und es dürfe Mühe machen zwischen meiner und Herrn Pollunders Freundschaf Rangunterschiede zu erkennen, aber in das Innere des Onkels können wir nicht hineinschauen und ganz besonders nicht über die vielen Kilometer hinweg, die uns hier von New York trennen."" „Bitte Herr Green"", sagte Karl und näherte sich mit Selbstüberwindung Herrn Green, „ich höre aus Ihren Worten heraus, daß Sie es auch für das Beste hal- ten, wenn ich gleich zurückkehre."" „Das habe ich durchaus nicht gesagt"", meinte Herr Green und vertiefe sich in das Anschauen des Briefes, an dessen Rändern er mit zwei Fingern hin und her fuhr. Er schien damit andeuten zu wollen, daß er von Herrn Pollunder gefragt worden sei, ihm auch geantwortet habe, während er mit Karl eigentlich nichts zu tun habe.","He took a step back and was now standing equidistant from Mr Pollunder and Mr Green. Didn't you want to tell him something?"" Mr. Pollunder asked Mr. Green and took Mr. Green's hand as if imploring. ""I don't know what to say to him?"" said Mr. Green, finally pulling a letter out of his pocket and laying it on the table in front of him. It is quite commendable that he should wish to return to his uncle, and it would be reasonable to believe that he would make the uncle particularly happy by doing so. It would have to be that his disobedience made his uncle too angry, which is also possible. In that case, however, it would be better if he stayed here. It's just difficult to say something specific, we are both friends of the uncle and it should be difficult to recognize differences in rank between my friendship and Mr. Pollunder's, but we can't look into the inside of the uncle and especially not over the many kilometers who are separating us from New York here."" ""Please Mr. Green,"" said Karl and approached Mr. Green with self-control, ""I can hear from your words that you also think it would be best if I came back immediately. ""I didn't say that at all,"" said Mr. Green, studying the letter intently, running two fingers along the edges. He seemed to want to imply that he had been asked by Herr Pollunder and had also answered him, while he actually had nothing to do with Karl.","He took a step back and was now equidistant from Mr Pollunder and Mr Green. ‘Didn’t you have something to say to him?’ Mr Pollunder asked Mr Green, as though imploringly taking Mr Green’s hand. ‘I wouldn’t know what I had to say to him?’ said Mr Green, finally pulling a letter from his wallet, and laying it on the table. ‘It’s all very laudable of him to want to go back to his uncle, and one might go so far as to predict that he will give his uncle great pleasure by so doing. Unless, that is, he has previously so angered his uncle by his disobedience, which is also possible. In that case, he would be better advised to stay here. It’s difficult to say anything definite, both of us are friends of his uncle’s, and it would be a tricky thing to establish some pecking order between my friendship with his uncle and Mr Pollunder’s, but finally we can’t see inside the uncle, least of all so many miles away from New York.’ ‘Mr Green, please,’ said Karl, and overcoming his reluctance, he approached Mr Green, ‘I understand you to be suggesting that the best course for me would be to return right away as well.’ ‘That’s not what I meant at all,’ said Mr Green, and focused his attention on the letter, sliding two fingers up and down the edge of it. He seemed to be suggesting with that that he had been asked a question by Mr Pollunder and given him his reply, and that he had nothing to do really with Karl.","He stepped back and was now equidistant from Mr. Pollunder and Mr. Green. “Didn’t you want to tell him something?” Mr. Pollunder asked Mr. Green, seizing his hand as if beseeching him. “I wouldn’t know what to tell him,” said Mr. Green, who had finally drawn a letter from his briefcase and put it down on the table before him. “It’s very praise worthy that he should want to go back to his uncle, and one might quite reasonably assume that he will thereby give his uncle great pleasure. Unless he has through his disobedience already made his uncle exceedingly mad, which is certainly possible. In that case it would be better if he stayed. But it’s hard to say anything more definitive than that; although we’re both friends of his uncle’s and it would be hard to detect any difference in degree between my friendship with his uncle and that of Mr. Pollunder, we cannot peer into his uncle’s mind, especially not across the many miles that separate us from New York.” “Please, Mr. Green,” said Karl, and overcoming his reluctance, he approached Mr. Green, “I gather from what you’ve said that you too think it best that I should return at once.” “I said nothing of the sort,” declared Mr. Green, who, burying himself in the letter, ran his fingers back and forth along the margins. Evidently he wished to signal in this way that he had been asked by Mr. Pollunder and had answered him but that he really had nothing further to say to Karl."
"„Es hat lange gedauert"", sagte Brunelda im allgemei- nen und zu Karl insbesondere sagte sie: „Du mußt ein wenig flinker sein, wenn Du willst, daß man mit Dir zufrieden ist. An dem faulen und gefräßigen Robinson darfst Du Dir kein Beispiel nehmen. Ihr habt wohl schon inzwischen irgendwo gefrühstückt, ich sage Euch, nächstens dulde ich das nicht.""","""It took a long time,"" Brunelda said in general, and to Karl in particular, she said: ""You have to be a little quicker if you want people to be happy with you. Don't follow the example of the lazy and gluttonous Robinson You must have had breakfast somewhere by now, I tell you, I won't tolerate that anytime soon.""","‘That took a long time,’ said Brunelda in a general way, and to Karl in particular she said: ‘You’ll have to speed up a bit if you want to give satisfaction. That lazy guzzling Robinson is not a good example for you. I expect you’ve already breakfasted on the way somewhere , well, I tell you, I won’t stand for that on another occasion.’","“It’s taken so long,” Brunelda said to no one in particular, and then to Karl: “If you want to satisfy us, you’ll have to be a little more nimble. You shouldn’t regard that lazy glutton Robinson as a model. You’ve probably already had your breakfast somewhere, but listen: Next time I won’t stand for this.”"
"Oben führte sie Karl in ein Zimmer, das zwar schon als Dachzimmer eine schiefe Wand hatte, im übrigen aber bei einer Beleuchtung durch zwei Glühlampen sich sehr wohnlich zeigte. „Erschrecken Sie nicht über die Einrichtung"", sagte die Oberköchin, „es ist nämlich kein Hotelzimmer, sondern ein Zimmer meiner Wohnung, die aber aus drei Zimmern besteht, so daß Sie mich nicht im geringsten stören. Ich sperre die Verbindungstüre ab, so daß Sie ganz ungeniert bleiben. Morgen als neuer Hotelangestellter werden Sie natürlich Ihr eigenes Zim- merchen bekommen. Wären Sie mit Ihren Kame- raden gekommen, dann hätte ich Ihnen in der gemein- samen Schlafammer der Hausdiener aufetten lassen, aber da Sie allein sind, denke ich, daß es Ihnen hier besser passen wird, wenn Sie auch nur auf einem Sopha schlafen müssen. Und nun schlafen Sie wohl damit Sie sich für den Dienst kräfigen. Er wird morgen noch nicht zu streng sein."" „Ich danke Ihnen vielmals für Ihre Freundlichkeit."" „Warten Sie"", sagte sie beim Ausgang stehen bleibend, „da wären Sie aber bald geweckt worden."" Und sie gieng zu der einen Seiten- tür des Zimmers, klopfe und rief: „Terese!"" „Bitte, Frau Oberköchin"", meldete sich die Stimme der kleinen Schreibmaschinistin. „Wenn Du mich früh wecken gehst, so mußt Du über den Gang gehn, hier im Zimmer schläf ein Gast. Er ist totmüde."" Sie lächelte Karl zu, während sie das sagte. „Hast Du verstanden?"" „Ja Frau Oberköchin."" „Also dann gute Nacht!"" „Gute Nacht wünsch ich.""","Upstairs she led Karl into a room which, although the attic had a crooked wall, was otherwise very comfortable with two lightbulbs lighting it up. ""Don't be alarmed by the furnishings,"" said the head cook, ""it's not a hotel room, it's a room in my apartment, which consists of three rooms, so you won't bother me in the slightest. I lock the connecting door so that ""You remain completely unashamed. Tomorrow, as a new hotel employee, you will of course get your own little room. If you had come with your comrades, I would have let the house servants put you up in the shared bedroom, but since you are alone, I think I think it will suit you better here if you only have to sleep on a sofa. And now sleep well so that you can strengthen yourself for duty. It won't be too severe tomorrow."" ""Thank you very much for your kindness."" ""Wait,"" she said, stopping at the exit, ""but you would have been woken up soon."" And she went to the side door of the room, knocked, and called: ""Terese !"" ""Please, head cook,"" said the little typewriter's voice. ""If you go to wake me up early, you'll have to go across the corridor. There's a guest sleeping in this room. He's dead tired."" She smiled at Karl while saying this. ""Do you understand?"" ""Yes, Mrs. Head Cook."" ""Good night then!"" ""I wish you good night.""","Upstairs, she took Karl to an attic room with a sloping ceiling that looked very cosy in the light of two electric lamps. ‘Don’t be put off by the furnishings,’ said the cook, ‘it’s not a regular hotel room, but one of the rooms in my apartment, which consists of three rooms, so you won’t be bothering me in the least. I’ll lock the connecting door, so you’ll have absolute privacy. When you join the hotel staff tomorrow you will of course be given a little room of your own. If you had brought your companions, I would have had beds made up for all of you in the staff dormitory, but as you’ve come on your own, I think you will be better off here, even though you’ll be sleeping on the sofa. And now I hope you sleep well, so you’ll be refreshed for work tomorrow. It won’t be too tough to begin with.’ ‘Thank you for all your kindness.’ ‘Wait,’ she said, stopping on her way out, ‘you would almost have been woken up.’ And she went over to one of the side doors of the room, knocked and called: ‘Therese!’ ‘Yes, Head Cook,’ the voice of the little typist replied. ‘When you come to wake me tomorrow morning, will you go via the corridor, I have a guest sleeping in this room. He’s terribly tired.’ She smiled at Karl as she said this. ‘Do you understand?’ ‘Yes, Head Cook’. ‘Good night, then!’ ‘Good night.’","Once upstairs she led Karl into a room, an attic room with a sloping wall, though otherwise very snug-looking in the light from two glow lamps. “Don’t be startled by the decor,” said the head cook. “You see, it’s not a hotel room but a room in my apartment, which has three rooms, so you won’t disturb me in any way. I shall lock the connecting door so you can feel completely at ease. As a new hotel employee, you will of course receive your own room tomorrow. If you had come with your companions, I should have given you a bed in the servants’ dormitory, but since you came alone, I think this will suit you better, even if you have only a sofa to sleep on. And now sleep well so you can fortify yourself for the work ahead. He’ll probably not yet be too strict tomorrow.” “Thank you very much for your kindness.” “Wait,” she said, halting at the door, “you’d have been awakened before long.” And she went to a side door in the room, knocked, and cried: “Therese!” “Yes, head cook,” the voice of the little typist replied. “When you come to wake me in the morning, you must go through the corridor, there’s a guest sleeping in this room. He’s dead tired.” She smiled at Karl as she said so. “You got that?” “Yes, head cook.” “Well then, good night!” “I wish you good night.”"
"Über den ersten Anblick beim Öffnen des Koffers war Karl entsetzt. Wieviele Stunden hatte er während der Überfahrt darauf verwendet, den Koffer zu ordnen und wieder neu zu ordnen und jetzt war alles so wild durch- einander hineingestopf, daß der Deckel beim Öffnen des Schlosses von selbst in die Höhe sprang. Bald aber erkannte Karl zu seiner Freude, daß diese Unordnung nur darin ihren Grund hatte, daß man seinen Anzug den er während der Fahrt getragen hatte, und für den der Koffer natürlich nicht mehr berechnet gewesen war, nachträglich mit eingepackt hatte. Nicht das geringste fehlte. In der Geheimtasche des Rockes befand sich nicht nur der Paß sondern auch das von zuhause mitgenom- mene Geld, sodaß Karl, wenn er jenes, das er bei sich hatte, dazu legte, mit Geld für den Augenblick reichlich versehen war. Auch die Wäsche, die er bei seiner An- kunf auf dem Leib getragen hatte, fand sich vor, rein gewaschen und gebügelt. Er legte auch sofort Uhr und Geld in die bewährte Geheimtasche. Das einzig Bedau- erliche war, daß die Veroneser Salami, die auch nicht fehlte, allen Sachen ihren Geruch mitgeteilt hatte. Wenn sich das nicht durch irgendein Mittel beseitigen ließ, hat- te Karl die Aussicht monatelang in diesen Geruch einge- hüllt herumzugehn.","Karl was shocked at the first sight when opening the case. How many hours had he spent during the crossing arranging and rearranging the trunk and now everything was stuffed in so haphazardly that the lid jumped up of its own accord when the lock was opened. But Karl soon realized to his delight that this disorder was only due to the fact that the suit he had worn during the journey, and for which the suitcase had of course no longer been calculated, had been packed afterwards. Nothing was missing. In the secret pocket of the coat there was not only the passport but also the money he had taken from home, so that Karl, if he put what he had with him, had plenty of money for the moment. The laundry he had been wearing on his body when he arrived was also there, washed clean and ironed. He also immediately put the watch and money in the proven secret pocket. The only regrettable thing was that the Veronese salami, which was also present, had given everything its smell. If that couldn't be removed by some means, Karl faced the prospect of walking around wrapped in that smell for months.","When he opened the suitcase Karl was appalled by what met his eyes. All those hours he had spent during the crossing, packing and repacking it, and now everything was crammed in in such a higgledy-piggledy fashion that the lid flew up when he opened the catch. But Karl soon saw to his joy that the sole cause of all this disorder was the fact that the suit he had worn during the crossing, and for which of course the suitcase had not allowed had been crammed in afterwards. Nothing at all was missing. In the secret pocket of his jacket there was not only his passport but also the money he had brought from home, so that, when Karl added it to what he already had on him, he was for the moment plentifully provided with money. The linen he’d been in on his arrival was also there, washed and ironed. He immediately put his wristwatch and money into the tried and tested secret pocket. The only lamentable circumstance was that the Verona salami, which was not missing either, had imparted its smell to everything in the suitcase. If that couldn’t be removed by some means, Karl faced the prospect of going around for the next several months shrouded in that smell.","On first opening the trunk, Karl was horrified. All those hours during the voyage he had spent arranging and rearranging the trunk, whereas now everything had been stuffed in so wildly that the lid sprang open as he released the lock. Yet to his delight Karl soon realized that the disorder was merely due to his having during the voyage worn the suit, which was not meant to be packed in the trunk and had been added in with the other things. There was absolutely nothing missing. In the secret pocket of his coat Karl found not only his passport but the money from home, so that when he added in the sum he was carrying, he was well provided for, at least for now. Even the underwear he wore on arrival was there too and had been washed and ironed. He immediately put his watch and money away in his trusty secret pocket. But it was unfortunate that the Veronese salami, which had not disappeared either, had communicated its smell to all of his belongings. Unless it could somehow be eliminated, Karl faced the prospect of going about for months enveloped in this smell."
"„Schuld also bin ich"", sagte Karl und machte eine Pau- se, als warte er auf ein freundliches Wort seiner Richter, das ihm Mut zur weitern Verteidigung geben könnte, aber es kam nicht, „schuld bin ich nur daran, daß ich den Mann, er heißt Robinson, ist ein Irländer, in den Schlaf- saal gebracht habe. Alles andere, was er gesagt hat, hat er aus Betrunkenheit gesagt und es ist nicht richtig."" „Du hast ihm also kein Geld versprochen?"" fragte der Oberkellner.","""So it's my fault,"" said Karl and paused, as if he were waiting for a friendly word from his judge that might give him the courage to continue his defense, but it didn't come, ""I'm only to blame for the fact that I Man, his name is Robinson, he's an Irishman, put in the dormitory. Everything else he said he said while drunk and it's not right."" ""So you didn't promise him any money?"" asked the head waiter.","‘So it’s my fault,’ said Karl, and paused, as though waiting for a kind word from his judges, that might encourage him to further defence, but none came, ‘but I’m only to blame for bringing the man, Robinson is his name, he’s Irish, into the dormitory. Everything else he said because he was drunk, and it isn’t true.’ ‘So you didn’t promise him any money?’ asked the Head Waiter.","“So I’m to blame,” said Karl, and he paused, as if awaiting from his judges a kind word that might give him the courage to go on defending himself, but the word never came, “I’m to blame only for taking that man, whose name is Robinson—he’s an Irishman—into the dormitory. As for everything else he said, he said so only because he was drunk and it’s not true.” “So you didn’t promise him any money?” asked the head waiter."
"Mit diesen Worten war allerdings jede Anknüpfung abgelehnt, aber Karl verließ trotzdem die Balkonecke, in der er dem Manne am nächsten war, nicht. Stumm sah er zu, wie der Mann in seinem Buche las, die Blätter wen- dete, hie und da in einem andern Buche, das er immer mit Blitzesschnelle ergriff, irgend etwas nachschlug und öfers Notizen in ein Hef eintrug, wobei er immer überraschend tief das Gesicht zu dem Hefe senkte.","With these words, of course, every connection was rejected, but Karl still didn't leave the corner of the balcony where he was closest to the man. He watched silently as the man read his book, turned the pages, looked up something here and there in another book, which he always grabbed at lightning speed, and often made notes in a notebook, always surprisingly deep lowered the face to which yeast.","With those words any attempt at contact had been rejected, but still Karl didn’t leave the corner of the balcony nearest to the man. He looked silently across as the man read his book, turned the pages, occasionally looked something up in another book which he always took down with lightning speed, and several times jotted something down in a notebook, bending surprisingly low over it as he did.","By responding in that fashion, the man had rejected all attempts to establish contact, yet Karl did not leave the corner of the balcony where he was closest to him.

"„Servus"", sagte Mack und reichte Karl die Hand. „Sie spielen ja recht gut, bisher habe ich bloß Ihre Reitkunst gekannt."" „Ich kann das eine so schlecht wie das ande- re"", sagte Karl. „Wenn ich gewußt hätte, daß Sie zuhö- ren, hätte ich bestimmt nicht gespielt. Aber Ihr Fräu- lein"" – er unterbrach sich, er zögerte „Braut"" zu sagen, da Mack und Klara offenbar schon mit einander schlie- fen. „Ich ahnte es ja"", sagte Mack, „darum mußte Sie Klara aus New-York hierherlocken, sonst hätte ich Ihr Spiel gar nicht zu hören bekommen. Es ist ja reichlich anfängerhaf und selbst in diesen Liedern, die Sie doch eingeübt hatten und die sehr primitiv gesetzt sind, haben Sie einige Fehler gemacht, aber immerhin hat es mich sehr gefreut, ganz abgesehen davon, daß ich das Spiel keines Menschen verachte. Wollen Sie sich aber nicht setzen und noch ein Weilchen bei uns bleiben. Klara gib ihm doch einen Sessel."" „Ich danke"", sagte Karl stok- kend. „Ich kann nicht bleiben, so gern ich hier bliebe. Zu spät erfahre ich, daß es so wohnliche Zimmer in diesem Hause gibt."" „Ich baue alles in dieser Art um"", sagte Mack.","""Servus,"" said Mack and shook Karl's hand. ""You play really well, so far I've only known your horsemanship."" ""I'm as bad at one thing as the other,"" said Karl. ""If I had known that you were listening, I certainly wouldn't have played. But your lady"" - he stopped himself, he hesitated ""bride "", since Mack and Klara were obviously already sleeping together. ""I suspected it,"" said Mack, ""that's why you had to lure Klara over here from New York, otherwise I wouldn't have gotten to hear your play at all. It's definitely suitable for beginners and even in these songs, which you had practiced and which are set very primitively, you made a few mistakes, but at least I was very happy, quite apart from the fact that I don't despise anyone's playing. But don't you want to sit down and stay with us a little longer? Klara give him a chair."" ""Thank you,"" Karl said haltingly. ""I can't stay, as much as I'd like to stay here. I found out too late that there are rooms like this in this house."" ""I'm remodeling everything like this,"" said Mack.","‘Hello there,’ said Mack, and gave Karl his hand. ‘You play pretty well, so far I’ve only known your horsemanship.’ ‘I do equally badly at both,’ said Karl. ‘If I’d known you were listening, I would certainly not have played. But your’ – he broke off, as he was reluctant to say ‘betrothed’ since Mack and Klara were obviously already sleeping together. ‘I thought so,’ said Mack, ‘that’s why Klara had to lure you away from New York, otherwise I’d never have got to hear you play. You’re only a beginner, and even in those pieces which you must have practised a lot, and which are in very rudimentary arrangements you made a few mistakes, but I was still very glad to hear you, quite apart from the fact that I despise no one’s playing. won’t you sit down and keep us company for a while. Klara, give him a chair.’ ‘Thank you,’ said Karl hesitantly. ‘But I can’t stay, however much I’d like to. I never knew this house had such cosy rooms.’ ‘I’m having everything converted to this style,’ said Mack.","“Hello,” said Mack, extending his hand toward Karl. “You do play very well, I was only aware of your riding skills.” “I’m no good at either,” said Karl. “Had I known you were listening, I wouldn’t have played. But your lady friend—” he broke off; he was reluctant to say fiancée since it was clear that Mack and Klara were already sleeping together. “I thought so,” said Mack, “and Klara had to entice you out from New York for that reason, otherwise I wouldn’t have heard you play. It’s highly amateurish all right, and you made several mistakes even in those songs with the very primitive arrangement that you had practiced beforehand, but still I was very pleased, and not just because I never look down on anybody else’s playing. But wouldn’t you like to sit down and stay a little longer? Do give him a chair, Klara.” “Thank you,” said Karl, hesitating. “Much as I’d like to stay, I cannot. I’m discovering too late that there are such cozy rooms in this house.” “I’m renovating everything in the same style,” said Mack."
"Am ersten Tag fuhren sie durch ein hohes Gebirge. Bläulichschwarze Steinmassen giengen in spitzen Keilen bis an den Zug heran, man beugte sich aus dem Fenster und suchte vergebens ihre Gipfel, dunkle schmale zerris- sene Täler öffneten sich, man beschrieb mit dem Finger die Richtung, in der sie sich verloren, breite Bergströme kamen eilend als große Wellen auf dem hügeligen Unter- grund und in sich tausend kleine Schaumwellen trei- bend, sie stürzten sich unter die Brücken über die der Zug fuhr und sie waren so nah daß der Hauch ihrer Kühle das Gesicht erschauern machte.","On the first day they drove through a high mountain range. Bluish-black masses of stone came up in sharp wedges up to the train, you leaned out of the window and looked in vain for their peaks, dark, narrow, torn valleys opened up, you described with your finger the direction in which they got lost, broad mountain streams came hurrying as great waves on the hilly ground and driving within themselves a thousand small waves of foam, they threw themselves under the bridges over which the train passed, and they were so close that the touch of their coolness made the face tremble.","On the first day they travelled over a high mountain range. Blue-black formations of rock approached the train in sharp wedges, they leaned out of the window and tried in vain to see their peaks, narrow dark cloven valleys opened, with a finger they traced the direction in which they disappeared, broad mountain streams came rushing like great waves on their hilly courses, and, pushing thousands of little foaming wavelets ahead of them, they plunged under the bridges over which the train passed, so close that the chill breath of them made their faces shudder.","On the first day they passed through a tall mountain range. The sharp angles of the bluish-black masses of rock went right up to the train; they leaned out the window and searched in vain for the peaks; dark narrow jagged valleys opened up, and with their fingers they traced the direction in which the valleys disappeared; broad mountain rivers swept forward in great waves over the craggy base, pushing along thousands of small foamy waves, plunging under the bridges over which the train passed, and coming so close that the breath of their chill made one’s face quiver."
"„Wer hat Dir denn das gesagt?"" fragte Karl.","""Who told you that?"" Karl asked.",‘Who told you that?’ asked Karl.,“But who told you so?” asked Karl.
"„So"", sagte die Oberköchin, hielt den Sessel an der Lehne und sah auf den Platz, den sie eben verlassen hatte. „Also sprich doch bitte ein Wort Roßmann!"" sag- te sie dann. Terese war von ihrem bisherigen Platz zur Oberköchin hinübergelaufen und hatte sich, was sie Karl sonst niemals hatte tun sehn, in die Oberköchin eingehängt. Der Oberkellner stand knapp hinter der Oberköchin und glättete langsam einen kleinen beschei- denen Spitzenkragen der Oberköchin, der sich ein wenig umgeschlagen hatte. Der Oberportier neben Karl sagte: Also wirds?"" wollte damit aber nur einen Stoß maskie- ren, den er unterdessen Karl in den Rücken gab. „Es ist wahr"", sagte Karl infolge des Stoßes unsicherer als er wollte, „daß ich den Mann in den Schlafsaal ge- bracht habe.""","""So,"" said the head cook, holding the chair by the armrest and looking at the place she had just left. ""So please say a word Rossmann!"" she said then. Terese ran over to the head cook from her previous place and hung on to the head cook, which she had never seen Karl do before. The head waiter stood just behind the head cook and slowly straightened a small modest lacy collar of the head cook that had turned up a little. The head porter next to Karl said: So it'll be?"" but only wanted to use it to mask a push he was meanwhile giving Karl in the back. ""It's true,"" Karl said more uncertainly than he wanted after the push, ""that I into the dormitory.""","‘Well,’ said the Head Cook, holding the back of the chair, and looking at the place where she had been sitting. ‘Well, won’t you say something please, Rossmann!’ she said. Therese had left her original place and run across to the Head Cook, and, something Karl had never seen her do before, linked arms with her. The Head Waiter was standing just behind the Head Cook, and was slowly smoothing down a modest little lace collar of hers that had turned up slightly. The Head Porter, standing next to Karl said: ‘Well get on with it,’ but only to mask a jab in the back he gave him at the same time. ‘It is true’, said Karl, sounding more uncertain than he meant to as a result of the jab, ‘that I brought the man into the dormitory.’","“Well,” said the head cook, holding her chair by the armrest and staring at the place she had just vacated. “So please do speak, Rossmann!” she said. Therese had already run across to the head cook from her position, and taken the head cook’s arm, which Karl had never seen her do before. The head waiter stood right behind the head cook, slowly smoothing out the head cook’s small plain lace collar, which was turned up a little. The head porter, who still stood next to Karl, said: “So out with it now,” merely so as to conceal a punch in the back that he was giving Karl. “It’s true,” said Karl, sounding less confident than he would have wished on account of the punch, “I did take the man into the dormitory.”"
"Gerade hatte sich Karl durch solche Überlegungen ein wenig beruhigt und machte sich daran, das in dieser Nacht eingenommene Trinkgeld unauffällig zu überzäh- len, denn es schien ihm dem Gefühl nach besonders reichlich gewesen zu sein, als der Oberkellner das Ver- zeichnis mit den Worten „Warten Sie noch bitte einen Augenblick Feodor"" auf den Tisch legte, elastisch auf- sprang und Karl so laut anschrie, daß dieser erschrocken vorerst nur in das große schwarze Mundloch starrte.","Karl had just calmed down a little with such considerations and began to count the tip he had received that night inconspicuously, because it seemed to him that it was particularly generous when the head waiter started the list with the words ""Please wait a moment Feodor"" on the table, jumped up flexibly and yelled at Karl so loudly that he was frightened and just stared into the big black mouth hole.","Having soothed himself a little by such reflections, Karl was just discreetly counting the tips he’d taken that night, because he had the feeling it had been a particularly good one when the Head Waiter put the inventory down on the table with the words ‘Would you just wait a moment longer please, Feodor,’ sprang lithely to his feet, and screamed at Karl so loudly that he could only stare in terror at his large, black, cavernous mouth.","No sooner had Karl succeeded in calming himself down a little with the help of such reflections and discreetly begun to count the night’s tips, for he sensed that they were especially abundant, than the head waiter uttered the words “Wait a little longer please, Feodor,” put the ledger on the table, sprang up, and shouted at Karl so loudly that all he could do was stare into the great black cavern of his mouth."
"„Es hilf nichts"", sagte der Kellner. „Sie haben wahr- scheinlich die Photographie zerrissen und die Stücke weggeworfen"", sagte Karl, „ich dachte sie wären meine Freunde, aber im Geheimen wollten sie mir nur schaden. Nicht eigentlich Robinson, der wäre gar nicht auf den Einfall gekommen, daß die Photographie solchen Wert für mich hat, aber desto mehr Delamarche."" Karl sah nur den Kellner vor sich, dessen Laterne einen kleinen Kreis beleuchtete, während alles sonst, auch Delamarche und Robinson, in tiefem Dunkel war.","""It's no use,"" said the waiter. ""You probably tore up the photograph and threw away the pieces,"" said Karl, ""I thought they were my friends, but secretly they only wanted to harm me. Not actually Robinson, it would never have occurred to him that the photograph was of such value to me, but all the more Delamarche."" Karl only saw the waiter in front of him, whose lantern illuminated a small circle, while everything else, including Delamarche and Robinson, was in deep darkness.","‘It’s no use,’ said the waiter. ‘They’ve probably torn up the photograph and thrown away the pieces,’ said Karl, ‘I thought they were my friends, but secretly they were only out to do me harm. Not so much Robinson, it probably wouldn’t even have occurred to him that the photograph would be so precious to me, but Delamarche all the more.’ Karl saw only the waiter in front of him, whose torch lit up a small circle, whereas everything else, including Delamarche and Robinson, was in pitch blackness.","“It’s no use,” said the waiter. “They’ve probably torn up the photograph and thrown away the pieces,” said Karl, “I thought they were my friends, but in secret they sought only to do me harm. Well, not Robinson, he would never have hit on the idea that I’m very attached to the photograph, but Delamarche most certainly would.” In front Karl could see only the waiter, whose lantern lit up a small circle, whereas everything else, including Delamarche and Robinson, was completely in the dark."
"Da sah er paar Schritte vor sich eine ältere offenbar zum Hotelpersonal gehörige Frau, die lachend mit ei- nem Gast redete. Dabei arbeitete sie fortwährend mit einer Haarnadel in ihrer Frisur herum. Sofort war Karl entschlossen seine Bestellung bei dieser Frau vorzubrin- gen, schon weil sie ihm als die einzige Frau im Saal eine Ausnahme vom allgemeinen Lärm und Jagen bedeutete und dann auch aus dem einfachem Grunde, weil sie die einzige Hotelangestellte war, die man erreichen konnte, vorausgesetzt allerdings daß sie nicht beim ersten Wort, das er an sie richten würde, in Geschäfen fortlief. Aber ganz das Gegenteil trat ein. Karl hatte sie noch gar nicht angeredet, sondern nur ein wenig belauert, als sie, wie man eben manchmal mitten im Gespräch beiseite schaut, zu Karl hinsah und ihn, ihre Rede unterbrechend, freundlich und in einem Englisch klar wie die Gramma- tik fragte, ob er etwas suche. „Allerdings"", sagte Karl, ich kann hier gar nichts bekommen."" „Dann kommen Sie mit mir Kleiner"", sagte sie, verabschiedete sich von ihrem Bekannten, der seinen Hut abnahm, was hier wie unglaubliche Höflichkeit erschien, faßte Karl bei der Hand, gieng zum Buffet, schob einen Gast beiseite, öff- nete eine Klapptür im Pult, durchquerte mit Karl den Gang hinter dem Pult, wo man sich vor den unermüd- lich laufenden Kellnern in Acht nehmen mußte, öffnete eine zweifache Tapetentüre und schon befanden sie sich in großen kühlen Vorratskammern. „Man muß eben den Mechanismus kennen"", sagte sich Karl.","Then, a few steps in front of him, he saw an elderly woman who apparently belonged to the hotel staff, who was laughing and talking to a guest. She constantly worked around with a hairpin in her hairstyle. Karl was immediately determined to take his order to this woman, if only because she, as the only woman in the room, meant an exception to the general noise and hunting, and then also for the simple reason that she was the only hotel employee who could be reached , provided, of course, that she didn't stray off on business at the first word he said to her. But quite the opposite happened. Karl hadn't spoken to her at all, just stalked her a little when, as one sometimes looks aside in the middle of a conversation, she looked at Karl and, interrupting her speech, asked him in a friendly manner and in English as clear as the grammar: if he is looking for something. ""Certainly,"" said Karl, I can't get anything here."" ""Then come with me, little one,"" she said, saying goodbye to her acquaintance, who took off his hat, which seemed incredibly polite, grabbed Karl's hand, went to the buffet, pushed a guest aside, opened a flap door in the desk, crossed the aisle behind the desk with Karl, where you had to watch out for the tirelessly running waiters, opened a double wallpapered door and you were in a large, cool pantry. ""You just have to know the mechanism,"" Karl said to himself.","Then he saw, a couple of steps ahead of him, an elderly woman, obviously part of the hotel staff, talking and laughing with one of the guests. All the time she kept working away at her coiffure with a hairpin. Karl immediately resolved to present his order to this woman, partly because as the only woman, she seemed to him to be an exception to the general noise and bustle, and partly for the simpler reason that she was the only hotel employee within reach, always assuming that she didn’t suddenly run off somewhere the second he addressed her. In fact, just the opposite happened. Karl hadn’t even addressed her, only listened in a little bit, when she, just in the way one sometimes looks to one side while talking, looked at Karl, and breaking off her conversation, asked him in friendly tones and in English of textbook purity whether he wanted something. ‘I do indeed,’ said Karl, ‘I can’t seem to get anything here.’ ‘Then come with me,’ she said, took her leave of her acquaintance, who doffed his hat to her – it seemed an act of incredible gallantry in the prevailing circumstances – took Karl by the hand, went to the buffet, pushed a customer aside, opened a hatch in the buffet, crossed the passage behind the tables with Karl, where you had to look out for the indefatigably rushing waiters, opened a double curtain, and there they were, in a large, cool storeroom. ‘It’s just a matter of knowing how it’s done,’ said Karl to himself.","Then a few steps in front of him he saw an older woman, who clearly belonged to the hotel staff, talking and laughing with a guest. She fiddled about in her hair continually with a clip. Karl immediately decided to place his order with this woman, first because she was the only woman in the hall and seemed to him to stand apart from all the noise and commotion, and then for the simple reason that she was the only hotel employee within reach, assuming of course that she would not run off on some errand at the first word he said. But exactly the opposite happened. Karl, who had been eavesdropping, had not yet addressed her when she looked up at him and, interrupting what she was saying and using English that was as clear as a grammar book’s, asked in a friendly voice if he was looking for something. “Yes indeed,” said Karl. “I can’t get anything here.” “Then come along with me, little fellow,” she said; then she said goodbye to her acquaintance, who raised his hat, which seemed like an unbelievably polite gesture in these surroundings, and, taking Karl by the hand, went to the buffet, pushed aside a guest, opened a hinged door in the counter, and with Karl in tow, crossed the corridor behind the counter, where one had to watch out for the tirelessly circulating waiters, and opened a double door that had been covered with wallpaper, and now they found themselves in large cool pantries. “You simply have to know the mechanism,” Karl said to himself."
"„Du hast Deinen Posten ohne Erlaubnis verlassen. Weißt Du was das bedeutet? Das bedeutet Entlassung. Ich will keine Entschuldigungen hören, Deine erlogenen Ausreden kannst Du für Dich behalten, mir genügt voll- ständig die Tatsache daß Du nicht da warst.

"Sie giengen dann durch eine der Eingangstüre entge- gengesetzte Tür auf einen kleinen Gang hinaus, wo an dem Geländer eines Aufzuges ein kleiner Lifjunge schlafend lehnte. „Wir können uns selbst bedienen"", sagte die Oberköchin leise und ließ Karl in den Aufzug eintreten. „Eine Arbeitszeit von zehn bis zwölf Stunden ist eben ein wenig zu viel für einen solchen Jungen"", sagte sie dann während sie aufwärts fuhren. „Aber es ist eigentümlich in Amerika. Da ist dieser kleine Junge z. B. er ist auch erst vor einem halben Jahr mit seinen Eltern hier angekommen, er ist ein Italiener. Jetzt sieht es aus, als könne er die Arbeit unmöglich aushalten, hat schon kein Fleisch im Gesicht, schläf im Dienst ein, trotzdem er von Natur sehr bereitwillig ist – aber er muß nur noch ein halbes Jahr hier oder irgendwo an- ders in Amerika dienen und hält alles mit Leichtigkeit aus und in fünf Jahren wird er ein starker Mann sein. Von solchen Beispielen könnte ich Ihnen stundenlang erzählen. Dabei denke ich gar nicht an Sie, denn Sie sind ein kräfiger Junge. Sie sind siebzehn Jahre alt, nicht?"" „Ich werde nächsten Monat sechzehn"", antwortete Karl. „Sogar erst sechzehn!"" sagte die Oberköchin. „Also nur Mut!""","They then went through a door opposite the front door into a small corridor where a little Lifjunge was leaning asleep on the railing of an elevator. ""We can help ourselves,"" said the head cook softly and let Karl into the elevator. ""A working day of ten to twelve hours is just a bit too much for a boy like that,"" she then said while they were going upstairs. ""But it's peculiar in America. There's this little boy B. He also only arrived here with his parents six months ago, he is Italian. Now it looks like he can't possibly stand the work, already has no flesh on his face, falls asleep on duty, although he is by nature very willing - but he only has six months to serve here or anywhere else in America and endures everything with ease and in five years he will be a strong man. I could talk to you about such examples for hours. I'm not even thinking about you, because you're a strong boy. You're seventeen, aren't you?"" ""I'll be sixteen next month,"" Karl replied. ""Only sixteen!"" said the head cook. ""So have courage!""","They went out through a door opposite the one he had come in at, on to a little passage where a little lift-boy was asleep on his feet, leaning against the railing of a lift. ‘We can help ourselves,’ said the cook quietly, and ushered Karl into the lift. ‘A ten or twelve hour day is just a bit much for a boy like that,’ she said, as they rode up. ‘ But America’s odd like that. Take that little boy, for instance, he only arrived here with his parents six months ago, he’s Italian. At the moment, it looks as though he couldn’t possibly stand up to his work, his face is gaunt, he falls asleep on his shift, even though he’s a very willing lad by nature – but give him another six months of working here or somewhere else in America, and he’ll take it with ease, and in five years’ time he’ll be a strong man. I could regale you for hours with cases like that. I’m not even considering you, because you’re a strong lad. You’re seventeen, aren’t you?’ ‘Sixteen next month,’ replied Karl. ‘Only sixteen!’ said the cook. ‘ Well, courage!’","They passed through a door directly opposite the entrance and entered a short corridor, where a small lift boy was sound asleep, leaning on the balustrade of an elevator. “Well, we can help ourselves,” said the head cook softly, motioning to Karl that he should enter the elevator. “A ten- to twelve-hour workday is just a little too much for such a boy,” she said as they ascended in the elevator. “But it’s peculiar in America. Take that little boy, for instance; he too only came half a year ago, with his parents; he’s an Italian. Right now it seems as if he could not possibly endure the work, there’s no flesh left on his face, he falls asleep while he’s on duty though he is by nature very willing—but he has only another six months to serve, either here or somewhere else in America, and will have no difficulty enduring everything, and in five years time he’ll be a strong man. I could go on for hours, giving you more such examples. And it’s not you I have in mind, since you’re such a sturdy youth. You’re seventeen years old, aren’t you?” “Next month I shall be sixteen,” replied Karl. “You’re still only sixteen!” said the head cook. “Well, don’t lose heart!”"
"„Das kannst Du Delamarche"", sagte Brunelda ein we- nig leiser, „schmeicheln und immer wieder schmeicheln wenn Du etwas schlecht gemacht hast."" Dann war es ein Weilchen still. „Jetzt küßt er sie"", sagte Robinson und hob die Augenbrauen.","""You can flatter Delamarche,"" said Brunelda a little more quietly, ""and flatter again and again when you've done something bad."" Then it was quiet for a while. ""Now he's kissing her,"" Robinson said, raising his eyebrows.","‘That’s typical of you, Delamarche,’ said Brunelda, a little more quietly, ‘you make a bad job of something, and then try and get out of it by flattering me unmercifully.’ Then there was silence for a while. ‘They’re kissing now,’ said Robinson, and raised his eyebrows.","“You’re good at it, Delamarche,” said Brunelda, a little more softly, “flattering me over and over again whenever you ’ve made a mess of something.” Then for a moment there was silence. “He’s kissing her,” said Robinson, raising his eyebrows."
"„Entschuldigen Sie vielmals"", sagte sie und stand ein wenig gebückt vor Karls Lager, „und verraten Sie mich bitte nicht. Ich will Sie auch nicht lange stören, ich weiß, daß Sie totmüde sind."" „Es ist nicht so arg"", sagte Karl, „aber es wäre vielleicht doch besser gewesen, ich hätte mich angezogen."" Er mußte ausgestreckt daliegen, um bis an den Hals zugedeckt sein zu können, denn er besaß kein Nachthemd. „Ich bleibe ja nur einen Augenblick"", sagte sie und griff nach einem Sessel, „kann ich mich zum Kanapee setzen?"" Karl nickte. Da setzte sie sich so eng zum Kanapee, daß Karl an die Mauer rücken mußte, um zu ihr aufschauen zu können. Sie hatte ein rundes gleichmäßiges Gesicht, nur die Stirn war ungewöhnlich hoch, aber das konnte auch vielleicht nur an der Frisur liegen, die ihr nicht recht paßte. Ihr Anzug war sehr rein und sorgfältig. In der linken Hand quetschte sie ein Ta- schentuch.","""Excuse me very much,"" she said and stood a little stooped in front of Karl's bed, ""and please don't tell me. I don't want to bother you for long, I know you're dead tired."" ""It's not that bad,"" said Karl, ""but it might have been better if I had dressed."" He had to lie stretched out to be covered up to his neck, for he had no nightgown. ""I'm only staying a moment,"" she said, reaching for a chair. ""Can I sit down by the sofa?"" Carl nodded. She sat down so close to the sofa that Karl had to move against the wall to be able to look up at her. She had a round, even face, only her forehead was unusually high, but that could only be due to the hairstyle, which didn't really suit her. Her suit was very clean and careful. She squeezed a handkerchief in her left hand.","‘Do please excuse me,’ she said, standing at Karl’s bedside, leaning over him a little, ‘and please don’t give me away. I won’t keep you long, I know you’re dead tired.’ ‘It’s not that bad,’ said Karl, ‘but perhaps it would have been better if I had got dressed after all.’ He was forced to lie flat, in order to remain covered up to the neck, as he didn’t have a nightshirt. ‘I’ll just stay for a moment,’ she said, and reached for a chair, ‘or can I sit down on your sofa?’ Karl nodded. And then she sat down on the sofa, so close to him that Karl had to move right back against the wall in order to be able to look up at her. She had a round face, and regular features, only her forehead was unusually high, but that might just be on account of her hairstyle, which didn’t quite suit her. Her dress was very clean and tidy. In her left hand she was squeezing a handkerchief.","“Many apologies,” she said, standing slightly stooped before Karl’s settee, “and please don’t give me away. I don’t wish to disturb you for long , I know you’re dead tired.” “It’s not that bad,” said Karl, “but perhaps it would have been better if I had put on my clothes.” He had to lie down flat so that he could be covered up to his neck, for he did not own a nightshirt. “Well, I shall only stay for a moment,” she said, reaching for a chair. “May I sit beside the settee?” Karl nodded. She seated herself so close to the settee that Karl had to move toward the wall so that he could look up at her. She had a round regular face—only her forehead was unusually high, but perhaps solely on account of her hairstyle, which didn’t entirely suit her. Her outfit was very clean and meticulous. In her left hand she was squeezing a handkerchief."
"Alles dieses ließ sich Karl durch den Kopf gehn, dach- te auch an Delamarche und verrichtete im übrigen seinen Dienst wie immer. Gegen Mitternacht hatte er eine klei- ne Abwechslung, denn Terese, die ihn öfers mit klei- nen Geschenken überraschte, brachte ihm einen großen Apfel und eine Tafel Chokolade. Sie unterhielten sich ein wenig, durch die Unterbrechungen, welche die Fahr- ten mit dem Aufzug brachten, kaum gestört. Das Ge- spräch kam auch auf Delamarche und Karl merkte, daß er sich eigentlich durch Terese hatte beeinflussen las- sen, wenn er ihn seit einiger Zeit für einen gefährlichen Menschen hielt, denn so erschien er allerdings Terese nach Karls Erzählungen. Karl jedoch hielt ihn im Grun- de nur für einen Lumpen, der durch das Unglück sich hatte verderben lassen und mit dem man schon auskom- men konnte. Terese widersprach dem aber sehr lebhaf und forderte Karl in langen Reden das Versprechen ab, kein Wort mit Delamarche mehr zu reden. Statt die- ses Versprechen zu geben, drängte sie Karl wiederholt schlafen zu gehn, da schon Mitternacht längst vorüber war, und als sie sich weigerte, drohte er seinen Posten zu verlassen und sie in ihr Zimmer zu führen. Als sie end- lich bereit war wegzugehn, sagte er: „Warum machst Du Dir so unnötige Sorgen, Terese? Für den Fall, daß Du dadurch besser schlafen solltest verspreche ich Dir ger- ne, daß ich mit Delamarche nur reden werde, wenn es sich nicht vermeiden läßt."" Dann kamen viele Fahrten, denn der Junge am Nebenlif wurde zu irgend einer andern Dienstleistung verwendet und Karl mußte beide Lifs besorgen. Es gab Gäste, die von Unordnung spra- chen und ein Herr, der eine Dame begleitete, berührte Karl sogar leicht mit dem Spazierstock, um ihn zur Eile anzutreiben, eine Ermahnung, die recht unnötig war. Wenn doch wenigstens die Gäste, da sie sahen, daß bei dem einen Lif kein Junge stand, gleich zu Karls Lif getreten wären, aber das taten sie nicht, sondern giengen zu dem Nebenlif und blieben dort, die Hand an der Klinke stehn oder traten gar selbst in den Aufzug ein, was nach dem strengsten Paragraphen der Dienstord- nung die Lifjungen um jeden Preis verhüten sollten. So gab es für Karl ein sehr ermüdendes Hin- und Herlau- fen, ohne daß er aber dabei das Bewußtsein gehabt hätte seine Pflicht genau zu erfüllen. Gegen drei Uhr früh wollte überdies ein Packträger, ein alter Mann mit dem er ein wenig befreundet war, irgend eine Hilfeleistung von ihm haben, aber die konnte er nun keinesfalls lei- sten, denn gerade standen Gäste vor seinen beiden Lifs und es gehörte Geistesgegenwart dazu sich sofort mit großen Schritten für eine Gruppe zu entscheiden. Er war daher glücklich als der andere Junge wieder antrat und rief ein paar Worte des Vorwurfs wegen seines langen Ausbleibens zu ihm hinüber, trotzdem er wahrschein- lich keine Schuld daran hatte. Nach vier Uhr früh trat ein wenig Ruhe ein, aber Karl brauchte sie auch schon dringend. Er lehnte schwer am Geländer neben seinem Aufzug, aß langsam den Apfel, aus dem schon nach dem ersten Biß ein starker Duf strömte, und sah in einen Lichtschacht hinunter, der von großen Fenstern der Vorratskammern umgeben war, hinter denen hängende Massen von Bananen im Dunkel gerade noch schim- merten.","All this went through Karl's head, he also thought of Delamarche and otherwise did his job as usual. Around midnight he had a little change, because Terese, who often surprised him with small gifts, brought him a large apple and a bar of chocolate. They talked a little, hardly disturbed by the interruptions that the elevator rides brought. The conversation also turned to Delamarche, and Karl noticed that he had actually let himself be influenced by Terese, even though he had considered him a dangerous person for some time, because that's how he appeared to Terese according to Karl's stories. Karl, however, basically considered him just a scoundrel who had let the accident ruin him and with whom one could get along. Terese, however, contradicted this very vehemently and in long speeches demanded that Karl promise not to speak another word to Delamarche. Instead of making this promise, she repeatedly urged Karl to go to sleep, since midnight was long past, and when she refused, he threatened to leave his post and take her to her room. When she was finally ready to leave, he said, ""Why are you worrying so needlessly, Terese? In the event that this should help you sleep better, I will gladly promise you that I will only speak to Delamarche if it is unavoidable."" Then there were many trips, because the boy on the side lift was being used for some other service and Karl had to get both lifs. There were guests who spoke of disorder, and a gentleman accompanying a lady even touched Karl lightly with his walking stick to urge him to hurry, a warning which was quite unnecessary at least the guests, since they saw that there was no boy standing by one lif, would have gone straight to Karl's lif, but they didn't do that, instead they went to the next lif and stayed there, their hand on the latch or even stepped in themselves enter the elevator, which, according to the strictest paragraph of the service regulations, the Lifjungen should avoid at all costs to fulfill exactly. At about three o'clock in the morning a porter, an old man with whom he was a little friend, wanted some help from him, but he couldn't afford it now, because there were guests in front of his two lifs and presence of mind was required to immediately decide for a group with big steps. He was happy, therefore, when the other boy returned, and shouted a few words of reproach at him for his long absence, although it was probably not his fault. After four o'clock in the morning there was a little rest, but Karl needed it urgently. He leaned heavily on the banister next to his elevator, slowly ate the apple, from which a strong odor emanated after the first bite, and looked down into a light well surrounded by large windows of the pantries, behind which hanging masses of bananas in the dark just shimmered.","All this passed through Karl’s mind, and he thought of Delamarche as well, as he went on doing his work. At midnight he had a little relief, because Therese, who would often come with little surprises, gave him a large apple and a bar of chocolate. They chatted awhile, barely put out by the interruptions of his taking the lift up and down. Conversation turned to Delamarche, and Karl realized that, in thinking of him as a dangerous person for some while now, he had allowed himself to be influenced by Therese, because that was how he appeared to her from what Karl had told her about him. Basically, though, Karl thought he was nothing worse than a scamp who had been turned to the bad by his misfortune, but with whom one could perfectly well get along. Therese though, took issue with that, and in long speeches pleaded with Karl to promise her that he would never exchange another word with Delamarche. Instead of making such a promise, Karl pressed her to go to sleep, it was already long past midnight, and when she refused he threatened to leave his post and take her up to her room himself. When she finally agreed to go, he said: ‘Why do you worry yourself unnecessarily, Therese? If it makes you sleep any better, I’ll gladly promise you that I won’t speak to Delamarche unless I absolutely have to.’ Then many rides were required of him, because the boy in the next door lift was called away on some errand, and Karl had to look after both lifts. Some hotel guests spoke of disorganization and one gentleman who was escorting a lady went so far as to tap Karl with his walking stick to make him hurry, something that was not called for at all. If only the guests would see that there was no boy standing by the other lift and would all come over to Karl’s, but no, they went to the other lift and remained there, with their hands on the door handle, or they even walked straight into it, which was something the lift-boy had to prevent at all costs, it was the strictest item in the rule book. The result for Karl was a lot of very fatiguing coming and going, and even then he didn’t feel he was discharging his duty properly. At about three in the morning, a porter, an old man with whom he was vaguely friendly, asked him for some help with something, but he was unable to give it, because there were groups of guests standing in front of both his lifts, and it needed great presence of mind to decide in favour of one of them, and promptly stride towards it. He was relieved, then, when the other boy returned and he called out a few words of reproach to him for his long absence, although it probably wasn’t his fault. After four o’clock there was a small lull, and not before time. Karl leaned against the railing beside his lift, slowly eating his apple, from which a strong sweet aroma rose from the very first bite, and looked down the lift-shaft, which was surrounded by the large windows of the storerooms, behind which great bunches of bananas glimmered faintly in the dark. 6","Karl considered all of this, thought about Delamarche too, and otherwise performed his duties as usual. Toward midnight he had a little diversion, for Therese, who often surprised him with little presents, brought him a large apple and a chocolate bar. They talked for a while, scarcely disturbed by the interruptions caused by his trips up and down in the elevator. The conversation turned to Delamarche, and Karl noticed that for some time now he had let himself be influenced by Therese and had begun to regard Delamarche as a dangerous person, for that was certainly how he seemed to Therese from Karl’s stories. But on the whole Karl considered him a mere wretch who had let himself be spoiled by misfortune and with whom one could nonetheless get along. Therese disputed this vigorously, though, insisting in lengthy speeches that Karl should promise her that he would never say a word to Delamarche again. Instead of making such a promise, he urged her repeatedly to go to sleep, and when she refused to do so, he threatened to leave his post and escort her back to her room. When she was at last ready to leave, he said: “Therese, why burden yourself with such unnecessary worries? In the hope of helping you sleep better, I’ll gladly promise you that I shall speak to Delamarche, but only if there’s no other way.” He then had to make numerous trips, since the youth in the adjacent lift was engaged in some other errand and Karl had to attend to both lifts. There were some guests who spoke of a great mess, and one gentleman, accompanied by a lady, gave Karl a little tap with his walking stick, prompting him to hurry up, but this admonition was quite uncalled for. If, after noticing that one of the lifts was unattended, the guest had only gone over to Karl’s lift right away—but no, instead of doing so, they went to the adjacent lift and stood there, holding the door handle or even stepping into the elevator, even though this was something that—according to the most severe paragraph in the service regulations—the lift boys were supposed to prevent at all cost. Karl therefore had to run back and forth wearily without even having the satisfaction of knowing that he was carrying out his duties exactly as intended. And then on top of it all, toward three in the morning a porter, an old man with whom he was on fairly friendly terms, wanted some help from him, but Karl certainly could not help him now, for there were guests standing before both of his lifts, and it took considerable presence of mind to select one group and stride toward it. So he was glad when the other lift boy resumed his duties, and he shouted a few words of reproach at him over his lengthy absence, even though he was probably not to blame. After about four in the morning things quieted down a little, but by then Karl urgently needed some rest. Leaning heavily on the balustrade by his elevator, he slowly ate the apple, which even after the first bite gave off a strong fragrance, and gazed down into one of the light shafts, which was surrounded by the great windows of the pantries, behind which hung masses of bananas that still shimmered in the dark."
"In diesem Augenblick beugte sich der Portier zum Ohr des Oberkellners und flüsterte etwas. Der Ober- kellner sah ihn zuerst erstaunt an und redete dann so rasch in das Telephon, daß Karl ihn anfangs nicht ganz genau verstand und auf den Fußspitzen zwei Schritte nähertrat.",At that moment the porter leaned towards the head waiter's ear and whispered something. The head waiter looked at him in astonishment and then spoke so quickly into the telephone that Karl didn't quite understand him at first and took two steps closer on tiptoe.,"At that moment the porter leaned forward and whispered something into the Head Waiter’s ear. At first the Head Waiter looked at him in amazement, and then spoke into the telephone at such a rate that to begin with Karl was unable to follow him quite, and advanced a couple of paces on tiptoe.","Just then the porter bent down to the head waiter and whispered a few words in his ear. At first the head waiter looked at him in astonishment, and then he spoke so rapidly into the telephone that Karl could not quite understand him at first and advanced two paces on tiptoes."
"Delamarche stand zuerst mit gekreuzten Armen hinter Brunelda, dann lief er ins Zimmer und brachte Brunelda den Operngucker. Unten war hinter den Musikanten der Hauptteil des Aufzuges erschienen. Auf den Schul- tern eines riesenhafen Mannes saß ein Herr, von dem man in dieser Höhe nichts anderes sah, als seine matt schimmernde Glatze, über der er seinen Zylinderhut ständig grüßend hoch erhoben hielt. Rings um ihn wur- den offenbar Holztafeln getragen, die vom Balkon aus gesehen ganz weiß erschienen; die Anordnung war der- artig getroffen, daß diese Plakate von allen Seiten sich förmlich an den Herrn anlehnten, der aus ihrer Mitte hoch hervorragte. Da alles im Gange war, lockerte sich diese Mauer von Plakaten immerfort und ordnete sich auch immerfort von neuem. Im weitern Umkreis war um den Herrn die ganze Breite der Gasse, wenn auch, soweit man im Dunkel schätzen konnte, auf eine unbe- deutende Länge hin, von Anhängern des Herrn ange- füllt, die sämtlich in die Hände klatschten und wahr- scheinlich den Namen des Herrn, einen ganz kurzen, aber unverständlichen Namen, in einem getragenen Ge- sänge verkündeten. Einzelne, die geschickt in der Menge verteilt waren, hatten Automobillaternen mit äußerst starkem Licht, das sie die Häuser auf beiden Seiten der Straße langsam auf- und abwärts führten. In Karls Höhe störte das Licht nicht mehr, aber auf den untern Balko- nen sah man die Leute, die davon bestrichen wurden, eiligst die Hände an die Augen führen.","Delamarche first stood behind Brunelda with his arms crossed, then he ran into the room and brought Brunelda the opera viewer. Below, behind the musicians, the main part of the procession had appeared. On the shoulders of a gigantic man sat a gentleman, of whom one could see nothing at this height but his dull, shimmering bald head, over which he held his top hat raised high in greeting. Wooden plaques were evidently being carried all around him, and seen from the balcony they appeared quite white; the arrangement was made in such a way that these posters leaned on all sides of the gentleman who towered above them. As everything was in progress, this wall of posters kept loosening and rearranging itself. In a wider radius around the Lord the whole width of the street, though for an insignificant length, as far as one could estimate in the dark, was filled with followers of the Lord, who all clapped their hands and probably the proclaimed the name of the Lord, a very short but incomprehensible name, in a solemn song. Individuals, cleverly distributed among the crowd, had automobile lanterns of extremely powerful light, which they slowly guided up and down the houses on either side of the street. At Karl's height the light was no longer a nuisance, but on the lower balconies one could see the people who were being bathed in it hurriedly put their hands to their eyes.","At first Delamarche stood behind Brunelda with arms crossed, then he ran into the room and fetched Brunelda the opera glasses. Down on the street, the main part of the procession had appeared behind the musicians. On the shoulders of one colossal man sat a gentleman, of whom nothing more could be seen from that height than his dully gleaming pate, over which he held his top hat aloft in perpetual greeting. Round about him some wooden placards were clearly being carried, they looked completely white from up on the balcony; their disposition was such that these placards seemed to lean against the gentleman on every side, and he soared up from their midst. As everything was continually on the move, the wall of placards was continually loosening and then re-forming itself. In a wider radius, the whole breadth of the street, though, so far as one could tell in the darkness, not much of its depth, was filled with supporters of the gentleman, all of them clapping their hands and calling out what was in all probability his name, which was short and unfortunately incomprehensible, in a long-drawn-out chanting. Individuals, cleverly distributed in the crowd, held car headlamps with extremely powerful light, which they ran slowly up and down the buildings on either side. At Karl’s elevation, the light was no longer bothersome, but on the lower balconies you could see the people whom it brushed hurriedly shielding their eyes with their hands.","At first Delamarche stood behind Brunelda with his arms crossed, and then he ran into the room and brought out opera glasses for Brunelda. Below, behind the musicians, the main section of the parade had appeared. Seated on the shoulders of an enormous man was a gentleman of whom all one could see from this height was a faintly glistening bald spot and a top hat perpetually raised in greeting. All around him people carried wooden signs that seemed completely white—at least as seen from the balcony; the signs were set up in such a way that they were literally leaning on the gentleman, who towered up in their midst. Since everything was moving, the wall of signs was continually loosening up and continually arranging itself anew. The gentleman’s supporters surrounded him, filling the entire width of the street—but only for a relatively short distance, at least insofar as one could make out in the dark—all of them clapped their hands and probably proclaimed his name in a rhythmic chant, which, however, was short and quite incomprehensible. Cleverly scattered about in the crowd, several of them carried car lamps with extremely strong lights, which they slowly trained up and down the houses along both sides of the street. At Karl’s height the light was no longer bothersome, but one could see the people on the lower balconies that it had briefly illuminated putting their hands over their eyes."
"Wenn es aber nur geholfen hätte! Ob es nicht auch schon zu spät war? Der Heizer unterbrach sich zwar sofort, als er die bekannte Stimme hörte, aber mit seinen Augen, die ganz von Tränen, der beleidigten Mannes- ehre, der schrecklichen Erinnerungen, der äußersten ge- genwärtigen Not verdeckt waren, konnte er Karl schon nicht einmal gut mehr erkennen. Wie sollte er auch jetzt, Karl sah das schweigend vor dem jetzt Schweigenden wohl ein, wie sollte er auch jetzt plötzlich seine Rede- weise ändern, da es ihm doch schien, als hätte er alles was zu sagen war ohne die geringste Anerkennung schon vorgebracht und als habe er andererseits noch gar nichts gesagt und könne doch den Herren jetzt nicht zumuten, noch alles anzuhören. Und in einem solchen Zeitpunkt kommt noch Karl sein einziger Anhänger daher, will ihm gute Lehren geben, zeigt ihm aber statt dessen, daß alles alles verloren ist.","If only it had helped! Wasn't it already too late? The stoker stopped himself as soon as he heard the familiar voice, but with his eyes completely covered by tears, the insulted man's honor, the terrible memories, the extreme present need, he didn't even know Karl well recognize more. How should he now, Karl realized in silence before the now silent man, how should he suddenly change his way of speaking, since it seemed to him that everything that needed to be said had already been said without the slightest recognition and as if, on the other hand, he hadn't said anything yet and couldn't expect the gentlemen to listen to everything. And at such a point in time, Karl, his only follower, comes along, wants to give him good lessons, but instead shows him that everything is lost.","If only it had helped! But was it not already too late? The stoker broke off the moment he heard the familiar voice, but with eyes dimmed with the tears of offended male honour, of frightful memories and the dire need of the moment, he barely even recognized Karl. How could he, Karl suddenly thought as the two of them silently confronted one another, how could he suddenly change his whole manner of speaking, it must seem to him that he had already said all there was to say, without anything to show for it, and, conversely, that he had said nothing at all, and he couldn’t presume that the gentlemen would willingly listen to everything. And at such a moment, his solitary supporter, Karl comes along wanting to give him a piece of advice, but instead only shows that all is lost.","If only it had helped! Might it be too late? On hearing that familiar voice, the stoker broke off in spite of the fact that he could hardly even recognize Karl, for his eyes were filled with tears, tears of wounded male honor, of dreadful memories, and of his extreme current distress. But how—the thought occurred to Karl, who had fallen silent, as he stood facing the now equally silent stoker—but how was he all of a sudden supposed to change the way he spoke, especially since he believed he had already brought up everything that needed to be said without obtaining even the slightest acknowledgment, and as if on the other hand he had still not said anything and could hardly expect the gentlemen to listen to everything all over again? And at that very moment along comes Karl."
"Gerade liefen einige Herren lebhaf miteinander spre- chend, Bleistife und Notizblätter in den Händen die Treppe herunter, Karl drückte sich ans Geländer um sie vorbeizulassen und stieg, da nun oben Platz geworden war hinauf. In einer Ecke der mit Holzgeländern verse- henen Platform – das ganze sah wie das flache Dach eines schmalen Turmes aus – saß, die Arme entlang der Holzgeländer ausgestreckt, ein Herr, dem ein breites weißes Seidenband mit der Aufschrif: Führer der 0ten Werbetruppe des Teaters von Oklahama quer über die Brust gieng. Neben ihm stand auf einem Tischchen ein gewiß auch bei den Rennen verwendeter telephonischer Apparat, durch den der Führer offenbar alle notwendi- gen Angaben über die einzelnen Bewerber noch vor der Vorstellung erfuhr, denn er stellte an Karl zunächst gar keine Fragen, sondern sagte zu einem Herrn, der mit gekreuzten Beinen, die Hand am Kinn neben ihm lehn- te: „Negro, ein europäischer Mittelschüler."" Und als sei damit der sich tief verneigende Karl für ihn erledigt sah er die Treppe hinunter, ob nicht wieder jemand käme. Aber da niemand kam, hörte er manchmal dem Ge- spräch, das der andere Herr mit Karl führte zu, blickte aber meistens über das Rennfeld hin und klopfe mit den Fingern auf das Geländer. Diese zarten und doch kräfi- gen, langen und schnell bewegten Finger lenkten zeit- weilig Karls Aufmerksamkeit auf sich trotzdem ihn der andere Herr genug in Anspruch nahm.","A few gentlemen were just running down the stairs, talking animatedly to one another, pencils and notebooks in their hands. Karl pressed himself against the railing to let them pass and climbed up, since there was now space at the top. In one corner of the wooden-railed platform—the whole thing looked like the flat roof of a narrow tower—sat, arms stretched along the wooden railings, a gentleman to whom a broad white silk ribbon with the inscription: Leader of the 10th Recruitment Troupe of the Teaters of Oklahama across the chest. Next to him on a small table was a telephone that was certainly also used in the races, through which the guide obviously found out all the necessary information about the individual applicants before the introduction, because at first he didn’t ask Karl any questions, but spoke to one Herr, who with crossed legs, his hand on his chin leaned next to him: ""Negro, a European high school student."" And as if that were the end of the deeply bowing Karl, he looked down the stairs to see if anyone was coming. But Since nobody came, he sometimes overheard the conversation that the other gentleman was having with Karl, but mostly he looked across the race field and tapped his fingers on the railing, those delicate yet strong, long and fast-moving fingers temporarily drew Karl's attention, although the other gentleman kept him busy enough.","Just then several gentlemen, engaged in a lively discussion, holding pencils and notebooks, came running down the stairs, Karl pressed himself against the bannister to let them pass, and as there was now room at the top he went on up. In a corner of the wooden-railed platform – it looked like the flat roof of a narrow tower – sat, with his arms spread out along the wooden rails, a gentleman wearing a broad white silk sash that said: Leader of the both Promotional Team of the Theatre of Oklahoma. On a little table next to him was a telephone, that was probably also used in the races, by which the leader could obviously learn all necessary information about each individual applicant before they were presented to him, because he asked Karl no questions to begin with, but merely observed to another gentleman who was leaning next to him, with feet crossed, and his chin cupped in his hand: ‘Negro, a secondary schoolboy from Europe.’ And as though that were all that was required of the deeply bowing Karl, he looked past him down the stairs, to see if there wasn’t anyone else coming along after him. But, as there wasn’t anyone, he occasionally listened in to the conversation the other gentleman was having with Karl, but mainly just looked out over the racetrack and drummed on the railing with his fingers. These delicate and yet sinewy fingers, long and in rapid motion, occasionally distracted Karl, in spite of the fact that the other gentleman was really sufficiently taxing on his own.","Just then several gentlemen ran down the steps, talking animatedly, pencils and notebooks in hand; Karl squeezed up against the balcony in order to let them pass, and since there was some free space on top now he went up the steps. In a corner of the platform, which was enclosed by wooden railings—the whole thing looked like the flat roof of a narrow tower—sat a gentleman whose arms were stretched along the railings and who wore, slung across his chest, a white silk sash with the words: “Leader of the Theater of Oklahama’s Tenth Recruiting Troupe.” On a little table beside him stood a telephone, which certainly was used at the races and now was employed to apprize the leader of all necessary details about the individual applicants even before they were introduced; for at first he did not ask Karl any questions, and merely said to a gentleman who was reclining beside him, legs crossed, hand on his chin: “Negro, a European middle school student.” As if he had thereby disposed of Karl, who gave a deep bow, he looked down the steps to see if there was anyone else coming. Since no one came, he listened from time to time to the other gentleman’s conversation with Karl, but for the most part he gazed out over the racetrack, tapping his fingers on the railing. Those delicate but strong, powerful, and rapidly moving fingers sometimes drew Karl’s attention, even though the other gentleman had already become sufficiently demanding."

"„Ob Sie es erwartet haben oder nicht, ist mir kolossal gleichgiltig. Lesen Sie nur schon"", sagte dieser und hielt Karl die Kerze hin.","""Whether you expected it or not, I don't give a damn. Just read it,"" he said and held out the candle to Karl.","‘I really couldn’t care less whether you were expecting it or not. Just read it,’ he said, and held the candle up to Karl.","“I couldn’t care less whether you were expecting it or not. Just read it,” he said, holding out the candle for Karl."
"„Ich bin nicht rachsüchtig"", sagte der Oberportier, „ich will nur Deine Taschen durchsuchen. Ich bin zwar überzeugt daß ich nichts finden werde, denn Du wirst wohl so vorsichtig gewesen sein und Deinen Freund al- les allmählich, jeden Tag etwas, haben wegschleppen las- sen. Aber durchsucht worden mußt Du sein."" Und schon griff er in eine von Karls Rocktaschen mit solcher Gewalt, daß die seitlichen Nähte platzten. „Da ist also schon nichts"", sagte er und überklaubte in seiner Hand den Inhalt dieser Tasche, einen Reklamkalender des Ho- tels, ein Blatt mit einer Aufgabe aus kaufmännischer Korrespondenz, einige Rock- und Hosenknöpfe, die Vi- sitkarte der Oberköchin, einen Polierstif für die Nägel, den ihm einmal ein Gast beim Kofferpacken zugeworfen hatte, einen alten Taschenspiegel, den ihm Rennel zum Dank für vielleicht zehn Vertretungen im Dienste ge- schenkt hatte und noch paar Kleinigkeiten. „Das ist also nichts"", wiederholte der Oberportier und warf alles un- ter die Bank, als sei es selbstverständlich, daß das Eigen- tum Karls, soweit es nicht gestohlen war, unter die Bank gehöre. „Jetzt ist aber genug"", sagte sich Karl – sein Gesicht mußte glühend rot sein – und als der Oberpor- tier durch die Gier unvorsichtig gemacht, in Karls zwei- ter Tasche herumgrub, fuhr Karl mit einem Ruck aus den Ärmeln heraus, stieß im ersten noch unbeherrschten Sprung einen Unterportier ziemlich stark gegen seinen Apparat, lief durch die schwüle Luf eigentlich langsa- mer als er beabsichtigt hatte zur Tür, war aber glücklich draußen, ehe der Oberportier in seinem schweren Man- tel sich auch nur hatte erheben können. Die Organisa- tion des Wachdienstes mußte doch nicht so mustergültig sein, es läutete zwar auf einigen Seiten, aber Gott weiß zu welchen Zwecken, Hotelangestellte giengen zwar im Torgang in solcher Anzahl kreuz und quer, daß man fast daran denken konnte, sie wollten in unauffälliger Weise den Ausgang unmöglich machen, denn viel sonstigen Sinn konnte man in diesem Hin- und Hergehn nicht erkennen – jedenfalls kam Karl bald ins Freie, mußte aber noch das Hoteltrottoir entlang gehn, denn zur Stra- ße konnte man nicht gelangen, da eine ununterbrochene Reihe von Automobilen stockend sich am Haupttor vorbeibewegte. Diese Automobile waren, um nur so bald als möglich zu ihrer Herrschaf zu kommen, gera- dezu ineinandergefahren, jedes wurde vom nachfolgen- den vorwärtsgeschoben. Fußgänger, die es besonders eilig hatten auf die Straße zu gelangen, stiegen zwar hie und da durch die einzelnen Automobile hindurch, als sei dort ein öffentlicher Durchgang und es war ihnen ganz gleichgültig, ob im Automobil nur der Chauffeur und die Dienerschaf saß oder auch die vornehmsten Leute. Ein solches Benehmen schien aber Karl doch übertrie- ben und man mußte sich wohl in den Verhältnissen schon auskennen, um das zu wagen, wie leicht konnte er an ein Automobil geraten, dessen Insassen das übelnah- men, ihn hinunterwarfen und einen Skandal veranlaß- ten und nichts hatte er als ein entlaufener, verdächtiger Hotelangestellter in Hemdärmeln mehr zu fürchten. Schließlich konnte ja die Reihe der Automobile nicht in Ewigkeit so fortgehn und er war auch, solange er sich ans Hotel hielt, eigentlich am unverdächtigsten. Tatsäch- lich gelangte Karl endlich an eine Stelle wo die Automo- bilreihe zwar nicht auförte, aber zur Straße hin abbog und lockerer wurde. Gerade wollte er in den Verkehr der Straße schlüpfen, in dem wohl noch viel verdächtiger aussehende Leute als er war, frei herumliefen, da hörte er in der Nähe seinen Namen rufen. Er wandte sich um und sah wie zwei ihm wohlbekannte Lifjungen aus ei- ner niedrigen kleinen Türöffnung, die wie der Eingang einer Gruf aussah, mit äußerster Anstrengung eine Bahre herauszogen, auf der wie Karl nun erkannte, wahrhafig Robinson lag, Kopf, Gesicht und Arme mannigfaltig umbunden. Es war häßlich anzusehn, wie er die Arme an die Augen führte, um mit dem Verbände die Tränen abzuwischen, die er vor Schmerzen oder vor sonstigem Leid oder gar vor Freude über das Wiedersehen mit Karl vergoß. „Roßmann"", rief er vorwurfsvoll, „warum läßt Du mich denn solange warten. Schon eine Stunde ver- bringe ich damit, mich zu wehren, damit ich nicht früher wegtransportiert werde ehe Du kommst. Diese Kerle"" – und er gab dem einen Lifjungen ein Kopfstück, als sei er durch die Verbände vor Schlägen geschützt – „sind ja wahre Teufel. Ach Roßmann der Besuch bei Dir ist mir teuer zu stehn gekommen."" „Was hat man Dir denn gemacht?"" sagte Karl und trat an die Bahre heran, wel- che die Lifjungen um sich auszuruhn lachend nieder- stellten. „Du fragst noch"", seufzte Robinson, „und siehst wie ich ausschaue. Bedenke! Ich bin ja höchst- wahrscheinlich für mein ganzes Leben zum Krüppel ge- schlagen. Ich habe fürchterliche Schmerzen von hier bis hier"" – und er zeigte zuerst auf den Kopf und dann auf die Zehen – . „Ich möchte Dir wünschen, daß Du gese- hen hättest wie ich aus der Nase geblutet habe. Meine Weste ist ganz verdorben, die habe ich überhaupt dort gelassen, meine Hosen sind zerfetzt, ich bin in Unterho- sen"" – und er lüfete die Decke ein wenig und lud Karl ein unter sie zu schauen. „Was wird nur aus mir werden! Ich werde zumindest einige Monate Hegen müssen und das will ich Dir gleich sagen, ich habe niemanden andern als Dich der mich pflegen könnte, Delamarche ist ja viel zu ungeduldig. Roßmann, Roßmannchen!"" Und Robin- son streckte die Hand nach dem ein wenig zurücktreten- den Karl aus, um ihn durch Streicheln für sich zu gewin- nen. „Warum habe ich Dich nur besuchen müssen!"" wiederholte er mehrere Male, um Karl die Mitschuld nicht vergessen zu lassen, die dieser an seinem Unglück hatte. Nun erkannte zwar Karl sofort, daß das Klagen Robinsons nicht von seinen Wunden, sondern von dem ungeheueren Katzenjammer stammte, in dem er sich be- fand, da er in schwerer Trunkenheit kaum eingeschlafen, gleich geweckt und zu seiner Überraschung blutig ge- boxt worden war und sich in der wachen Welt gar nicht mehr zurechtfinden konnte. Die Bedeutungslosigkeit der Wunden war schon an den unförmlichen aus alten Fetzen bestehenden Verbänden zu sehn, mit denen ihn die Lifjungen offenbar zum Spaß ganz und gar umwik- kelt hatten. Und auch die zwei Lifjungen an den Enden der Bahre prusteten vor Lachen von Zeit zu Zeit. Nun war aber hier nicht der Ort Robinson zur Besinnung zu bringen, denn stürmend eilten hier die Passanten ohne sich um die Gruppe an der Bahre zu kümmern vorbei, öfers sprangen Leute mit richtigem Turnerschwung über Robinson hinweg, der mit Karls Geld bezahlte Chauffeur rief „Vorwärts, vorwärts"", die Lifjungen ho- ben mit letzter Kraf die Bahre auf, Robinson erfaßte Karls Hand und sagte schmeichelnd „Nun komm, so komm doch"", war nicht Karl in dem Aufzug in dem er sich befand im Dunkel des Automobils noch am besten aufgehoben? und so setzte er sich neben Robinson, der den Kopf an ihn lehnte, die zurückbleibenden Lifjun- gen schüttelten ihm, als ihrem gewesenen Kollegen durch das Coupeefenster herzlich die Hand und das Automobil drehte sich mit scharfer Wendung zur Straße hin, es schien als müsse unbedingt ein Unglück ge- schehn, aber gleich nahm der alles umfassende Verkehr auch die schnurgerade Fahrt dieses Automobils ruhig in sich auf.","""I'm not vengeful,"" said the head porter, ""I just want to search your pockets. I'm sure I won't find anything, because you must have been so careful and your friend got everything little by little, something every day Have them dragged away. But you must have been searched."" And he was already reaching into one of Karl's coat pockets with such force that the side seams burst. ""So there's nothing there,"" he said, and in his hand he rummaged through the contents of this bag, an advertising calendar for the hotel, a sheet of paper with an assignment from commercial correspondence, a few coat and trouser buttons, the head cook's business card, a Polishing stick for his nails, which a guest had once thrown to him when he was packing his suitcase, an old pocket mirror which Rennel had given him as a thank you for maybe ten replacements on duty, and a few other small things. ""So that's nothing,"" repeated the head porter and threw everything in the bank, as if it were a matter of course that Karl's property, insofar as it wasn't stolen, belonged in the bank. ""But that's enough for now,"" Karl said to himself - his face must have been red hot - and when the head porter, careless due to greed, dug around in Karl's second pocket, Karl jerked out of his sleeves, bumped into his In the first, still uncontrolled jump, a sub-porter hit his apparatus quite hard, actually ran through the humid air to the door more slowly than he had intended, but was happily outside before the head porter in his heavy coat could even get up The organization of the security service didn't have to be so exemplary, the bell rang on a few pages, but God knows for what purpose, hotel employees walked back and forth in the doorway in such numbers that one could almost think they wanted to be inconspicuous making it impossible to go out, because one could not see much other sense in this walking back and forth - in any case, Karl soon came out into the open, but still had to walk down the hotel sidewalk g go, because you couldn't get to the street, because an uninterrupted line of automobiles moved hesitantly past the main gate. These automobiles, in order to gain control of them as soon as possible, had almost bumped into each other, each being pushed forward by the one that followed. Pedestrians, who were in a particular hurry to get onto the street, climbed through the individual automobiles here and there as if there were a public passageway, and it made no difference to them whether only the chauffeur and the servants were in the automobile or they too noblest people. But such behavior seemed excessive to Karl and one had to be familiar with the situation to dare to do so, how easily he could get hold of an automobile whose occupants took offense, threw him out and caused a scandal and nothing he had to fear more than a runaway, suspicious hotel clerk in shirt sleeves. After all, the line of automobiles couldn't go on like this forever, and as long as he stuck to the hotel he was actually the least suspect. In fact, Karl finally got to a point where the line of cars didn't end, but turned towards the street and became looser. He was just about to slip into the traffic of the street, in which probably even more suspicious-looking people than he was running about freely, when he heard his name called nearby. He turned and saw two Lifjungen, whom he knew well, pulling out of a low, little doorway, which looked like the entrance of a crypt, with the utmost effort, a stretcher on which, Karl now realised, was really Robinson lying, head, face and arms diversely bound. It was ugly to look at how he put his arms to his eyes to use the bandage to wipe away the tears he shed from pain or other suffering or even from the joy of seeing Karl again. ""Roßmann,"" he cried reproachfully, ""why are you making me wait so long. I've been spending an hour defending myself so that I won't be transported away before you come. These fellows"" - and he gave one of the Lifjungen a head piece, as if he were protected from blows by the bandages - ""are real devils. Oh Rossmann, the visit to you cost me dearly."" ""What did they do to you?"" said Karl and approached the stretcher, which the Lifjungen laid down to rest, laughing. ""You're still asking,"" Robinson sighed, ""and you see how I look. Think! I'm most likely crippled for life. I'm in terrible pain from here to here"" - and he pointed to the first Head and then on your toes - . ""I wish you could have seen my nose bleed. My vest is completely spoiled, I left it there anyway, my pants are torn, I'm in my underpants"" – and he lifted the blanket a little and invited Karl to look under it. ""What will become of me! I will have to take care of me for at least a few months and I want to tell you that right away, I have no one else to take care of me but you, Delamarche is far too impatient. Roßmann, Roßmannchen!"" And Robinson stretched out his hand to Karl, who was stepping back a little, to win him over by stroking him. ""Why did I have to visit you?"" he repeated several times, so as not to let Karl forget the complicity he had in his misfortune. Now Karl recognized immediately that Robinson's lamentation was not about his wounds, but about the monstrous one The hangover he was in because he was so drunk that he barely fell asleep, was woken up straight away and to his surprise he was punched bloody and couldn't find his way around in the waking world to see the shapeless bandages of old rags the lifboys had apparently wrapped him all over him for fun.And the two lifboys at the ends of the stretcher also snorted with laughter from time to time.But this wasn't him Place to bring Robinson to his senses, because the passers-by rushed past without paying attention to the group on the stretcher, people often jumped over Robi with real gymnastic swings nson away, the chauffeur who was paid with Karl's money called ""Forward, forward,"" the Lifjungen lifted the stretcher with their last strength, Robinson took Karl's hand and said coaxingly, ""Come on, come on,"" Karl wasn't in the elevator in which he was best kept in the dark of the automobile? and so he sat down next to Robinson, who leaned his head against him, the Lif boys who stayed behind shook his hand cordially as their former colleague through the coupe window and the car turned sharply towards the street, it seemed as if it had to be an accident had happened, but the all-encompassing traffic calmly absorbed the perfectly straight drive of this automobile.","‘I’m not vengeful,’ said the Head Porter. ‘I just want to look through your pockets. Of course I won’t find anything in them, because I am sure you will have taken the precaution of letting your friend remove a little every day. But searched you must be.’ And he reached into Karl’s jacket pocket with such force that the stitching split at the side. ‘Well, nothing there,’ he said, as he picked over the contents of the pocket in his hand, a calendar advertising the hotel, a sheet of paper with an exercise in business correspondence on it, a few jacket and trouser buttons, the Head Cook’s visiting card, a nail-file that a guest had tossed him while packing his suitcase, an old pocket mirror that Renell had given him in return for the dozen or so times he’d stood in for him, and a few more bits and pieces besides. ‘Nothing there,’ repeated the Head Porter, and threw everything under the seat, as though it were self-evident that any property of Karl’s that hadn’t been stolen belonged there. ‘I’ve had enough,’ said Karl to himself – his face must be scarlet – and when the Head Porter, incautious in his greed, started digging around in Karl’s other pocket, Karl quickly slid out of his sleeves, leaped aside, knocking an under-porter quite hard against his telephone, ran rather more slowly through the humid air than he’d meant to, to the door, but was happily outside before the Head Porter had even been able to pick himself up in his heavy coat. The organization of the hotel security couldn’t have been that exemplary after all, he heard bells ringing from several quarters, but God knows what they were ringing for, hotel employees were swarming around the entrance in such numbers that one could almost imagine they were unobtrusively making it impassable, because he really couldn’t see much purpose in all their toing and froing – anyway, Karl quickly got outside, but was then forced to walk along the pavement in front of the hotel, he couldn’t get to the public street, as an unbroken line of cars was driving haltingly past the entrance. These cars, trying to get as quickly as possible to their passengers waiting for them, had practically driven into one another, each one was being pushed along by the one behind. Pedestrians who were in a particular hurry to get to the street did occasionally walk through an individual car here and there, as though it were some public thoroughfare, and they were quite indifferent as to whether the car contained just chauffeur and servants or the most distinguished people. Such behaviour seemed overdone to Karl, and you probably had to be familiar with the conditions to try it, it would be very easy to try it with a car whose occupants might object, throw him out and cause a scandal, and there was nothing he had to fear more than that as a runaway, suspicious hotel employee in shirtsleeves. After all, this line of cars couldn’t go on for ever, and for as long as he stuck close to the hotel it was actually the least obtrusive place for him. Finally Karl came to a place where the line of cars, though not actually broken, did loosen a little as it converged with the street. He was just about to slip into the traffic, which contained far more suspicious-looking persons than himself, running around without a care in the world, when he heard his name being called. He turned round and saw two lift-boys he knew well, at a low doorway that looked like the entrance to a tomb, with immense effort pulling out a litter, on which, as Karl could now determine, lay Robinson, indeed, head, face and arms all swathed in bandages. It was horrid to see him rubbing at his eyes bringing his arms up to his face in order to wipe away with the bandage the tears he was shedding out of pain or some other suffering, or even possibly joy at seeing Karl once more. ‘ Rossmann,’ he called out reproachfully, ‘why have you kept me waiting so long. I’ve spent the last hour trying to keep them from shipping me off before you arrived. These fellows’ – and he nodded in the direction of one of the lift-boys, as though guaranteed immunity by his bandages from further blows – ‘are devils incarnate. Oh Rossmann, how my visit to you has cost me.’ ‘What happened to you?’ asked Karl, and stepped up to the litter which the lift boys laughingly put down for a rest. ‘How can you ask,’ sighed Robinson, ‘just look at me. Consider! In all probability I’ve been crippled for life. I’m in excruciating pain from here to here’ – and he indicated first his head then his toes – ‘I only wish you could have seen my nose bleed. My waistcoat is completely ruined, I had to leave it behind, my trousers are ripped, I’m in my underpants’ – and he raised the blanket a little so that Karl could take a look. ‘What’s going to become of me? I’ll have to spend several months recuperating minimum, and I can tell you this right now, I have no one but you who can look after me, Delamarche is far too impatient. Rossmann, little Rossmann!’ And Robinson stretched out his hand to Karl, who had stepped back a little, to win him over by stroking him. ‘Why did I have to go and visit you!’ he said repeatedly, lest Karl forget his part in his misfortune. Karl recognized at once that Robinson’s lamentations stemmed not from his wounds, but from the incredible hangover he must be suffering, as one who had barely dropped off, heavily drunk, had been awoken straight afterwards, to his amazement beaten to a pulp, and was now completely disorientated in the waking world. The trivial nature of his injuries was already evident from his unsightly bandages of old rags which the lift-boys had completely swaddled him in, evidently for a lark. The two lift-boys at either end of the litter burst out giggling from time to time too. But this wasn’t the place to bring Robinson round, pedestrians rushed past without paying any attention to the little group around the litter, people regularly hurdled athletically over Robinson’s body, the driver paid with Karl’s money was calling: ‘Come on, come on,’ the lift-boys, at the end of their strength, hoisted up the litter once more, Robinson took Karl’s hand and said wheedlingly, ‘Oh come on, come on,’ and wasn’t the darkness of an automobile the best place for Karl in his present predicament? And so he sat down next to Robinson, who rested his head against him, the lift-boys staying behind, heartily shook his hand through the window, as their former colleague, and the car turned sharply into the road, it seemed as though an accident were bound to happen, but then the all-encompassing traffic calmly accommodated the arrowy thrust of their car into itself.","“I’m not vindictive,” said the head porter. “I simply want to search through your pockets. But I’m convinced that I shall not find anything, for you were no doubt sufficiently cautious as to ask your friend to cart things off bit by bit, a little every day. But you must be searched.” Whereupon he dug into one of Karl’s coat pockets with such force that the seams on the side burst. “ So there’s nothing left ,” he said, combing through the contents of Karl’s pockets, which he had spread out in his palm: a hotel advertising calendar, a page with an exercise from a business correspondence manual, several coat and trouser buttons, the head cook’s visiting card, a nail-polishing stick, which a guest had thrown to him while his trunks were being packed, an old pocket mirror Renell had given him as thanks for covering for him about ten times, and several other small items. “So it’s all gone,” repeated the head porter, and he threw everything under the bench as though Karl’s possessions, insofar as they had not been stolen, belonged under the bench. “ That’s enough ,” Karl said to himself—his face must have been bright red—and when, rendered incautious through sheer greed, the head porter began to dig about in a second pocket of Karl ’s , Karl jumped out of his coat sleeves in one great bound, pushed an underporter up against his telephone, ran through the humid air to the door, although somewhat more slowly than he had intended, and yet was fortunately outside by the time the head porter in his heavy coat had even managed to get to his feet. The security service must not have been that exemplary; true, there were bells ringing in some parts of the hotel, but God only knew to what end, and indeed there were so many hotel employees walking back and forth at the main gateway that one could almost imagine they were making a discreet attempt to block the exit, for otherwise all that movement to and fro would have seemed quite senseless— in any case Karl soon found himself outdoors; but he was obliged to walk on the pavement in front of the hotel for it was impossible to reach the street because of the continuous line of cars passing the main gate in fits and starts. In their endeavor to get to their masters as fast as possible, these automobiles had almost collided, each propelled by the one behind. Here and there pedestrians in a particular hurry to reach the street climbed between the individual automobiles, as though there were a designated crossing, regardless of whether the occupants consisted solely of a chauffeur and servants or also included the most distinguished individuals. Yet such behavior struck Karl as excessive, for you probably had to know the situation very well before you took such a risk; he could so easily chance upon an automobile whose occupants would take offense and throw him off, causing a scandal, which he, a suspicious-looking hotel employee in shirtsleeves who had run away from his workplace, had most to fear. Finally, the line of automobiles could hardly go on forever like this, and besides, the closer he stayed to the hotel, the less suspect he would seem. At last Karl reached a spot where the line of automobiles, though not at an end, turned into the street and loosened up. He was just about to slip into the traffic in the street, where there must surely have been others far more suspicious-looking than he, when he heard somebody call out his name. He turned around and saw two very familiar lift boys dragging a stretcher laboriously out of a small low doorway, which looked like the entrance to a vault, and upon that stretcher, as Karl now saw, lay Robinson, whose head, face, and arms were covered with numerous bandages. It was revolting to watch him raise his arms to his eyes and use the bandage to wipe off his tears of pain or sorrow or even of joy upon seeing Karl again. “Rossmann,” he cried reproachfully, “why have you kept me waiting so long? I spent an hour struggling to avoid being carted off before you got here. Those fellows”—and he butted one of the lift boys, as though the bandages offered sufficient protection against any possible blows—“they’re true devils. Oh yes, Rossmann, I’ve certainly paid a high price for having visited you.” “But what have they done to you?” said Karl, approaching the stretcher, which the lift boys set down, laughing, so as to take a rest. “You insist on asking,” sighed Robinson, “though you can see how I look. Just imagine! That beating has most likely crippled me for the rest of my life. I’ve terrible pains from here to here”—and he pointed first to his head, then to his toes. “I wish you could have seen the way my nose was bleeding. My waistcoat is completely ruined, I simply left it there, my trousers too were torn to shreds, I’m just in my underpants”—and raising the blanket a little, he bade Karl look underneath. “What’ll become of me! I’ll have to spend a few months lying in bed, and I want to tell you right away that you’re the only one I can rely on to take care of me , Delamarche is really much too impatient for that. Oh Rossmann, my dear little Rossmann!” And Robinson stretched out his hand to Karl, who had stepped back a little, so as to win him over with caresses. “Oh, why did I have to visit you!” he repeated several times so as to ensure that Karl would not forget that he was partly to blame for the misfortune. Karl immediately realized that Robinson’s complaints stemmed not from his wounds but rather from the massive hangover afflicting him, for no sooner had he fallen asleep in a severely intoxicated state than he had been awakened and, much to his surprise, boxed around and bloodied and could no longer find his way about in the wide-awake world. That his wounds were minor was clear from the misshapen bandages, consisting of old rags, in which the lift boys had, obviously in jest, completely enveloped him. And now and then the two lift boys holding the ends of the stretcher burst out laughing. Well, this was not the place to bring Robinson back to his senses, for pedestrians continued to storm past, paying no heed to the group by the stretcher; when, with truly athletic leaps, several jumped over Robinson, the latter together with the chauffeur, who had been paid with Karl’s money, cried, “Come on now, come on,” and drawing on their last strength, the lift boys raised the stretcher. Robinson grabbed Karl’s hand and said cajolingly, “Come along, do come along,” after all, in the suit he wore, wouldn’t Karl be better off in the dark auto mobile? And so he sat down beside Robinson, who leaned his head on him: the lift boys stayed behind and, reaching through the coupe window, shook hands amicably with him, their former colleague, and then with a sharp turn, the auto mobile veered toward the street; it looked as if there would inevitably be an accident, but it was not long before the all-embracing traffic calmly accepted even the arrowlike momentum of this automobile into its midst."
"Für Karl stand aber doch in dem Plakat eine große Verlockung. „Jeder war willkommen"", hieß es. Jeder, also auch Karl. Alles was er bisher getan hatte, war ver- gessen, niemand wollte ihm daraus einen Vorwurf ma- chen. Er durfe sich zu einer Arbeit melden, die keine Schande war, zu der man vielmehr öffentlich einladen konnte! Und ebenso öffentlich wurde das Versprechen gegeben, daß man auch ihn annehmen würde. Er ver- langte nichts besseres, er wollte endlich den Anfang ei- ner anständigen Laufahn finden und hier zeigte er sich vielleicht. Mochte alles Großsprecherische, was auf dem Plakate stand, eine Lüge sein, mochte das große Teater von Oklahama ein kleiner Wandercirkus sein, es wollte Leute aufnehmen, das war genügend. Karl las das Plakat nicht zum zweitenmale, suchte aber noch einmal den Satz: „Jeder ist willkommen"" hervor.","For Karl, however, there was a great temptation in the poster. ""Everyone was welcome,"" they said. Everyone, including Karl. Everything he had done so far was forgotten, nobody wanted to blame him for it. He was allowed to report for a job that was no shame. to which one could rather invite publicly! And the promise was made just as publicly that one would also accept him. He didn't ask for anything better, he wanted to finally find the beginning of a decent career and this is where he might show himself. Liked everything Boasting that what was on the poster was a lie, the big theater in Oklahama might be a small traveling circus, it wanted to take people in, that was enough Karl didn't read the poster a second time, but he looked for the sentence again: ""Everyone is welcome"".","But for Karl there was a great lure in the poster. ‘All welcome’ it said. All, even Karl. Everything he had done up until now would be forgotten, no one would hold it against him. He could turn up for work that was not a disgrace, something for which people were openly invited to apply! And just as open was the promise that he would be taken on as well. He could ask for nothing better, he wanted to begin a proper career at last, and perhaps this was the way. Maybe all the grandiloquence of the poster was just a trick, maybe the great Theatre of Oklahoma was just a little touring circus, but it was taking people on, and that was enough. Karl didn’t read the poster through again, he just looked out the sentence ‘All welcome’ once more.","The poster offered Karl one great enticement. “Everyone is welcome,” it said. Everyone—in other words, Karl too. Everything he had ever done was forgotten, no one would reproach him anymore. And he could sign up for work that was not shameful and could be advertised openly! And they promised just as openly that he too would be taken on. He certainly could ask for no better; he just wanted to start off at last in some respectable career, and perhaps this was it. For even if all of that boasting on the poster was a lie, and even if the great Theater of Oklahama was merely a little strolling circus, it wanted to hire people, and that was good enough. Karl did not read the poster a second time, but glanced through it to find the sentence: “Everyone is welcome.”"
"„Mir schmeckt schwarzer Kaffee nicht"", sagte Karl.","""I don't like black coffee,"" Karl said.","‘I don’t like black coffee,’ said Karl.","“I don’t like black coffee,” said Karl."
"Er sah bald ein, daß er, abgesehen davon, daß auch keine andere Schlafgelegenheit, weder Kanapee noch So- pha, vorhanden war, zu keinem Schlafe werde kommen können, denn er durfe seinen erst wiedergewonnenen Koffer und das Geld, das er bei sich trug, keiner Gefahr aussetzen. Weggehn aber wollte er auch nicht, denn er getraute sich nicht, an der Zimmerfrau und dem Wirt vorüber das Haus wieder gleich zu verlassen. Schließlich war es ja hier doch vielleicht nicht unsicherer als auf der Landstraße. Auffallend war freilich, daß im ganzen Zim- mer, soweit sich das bei dem halben Licht feststellen ließ, kein einziges Gepäckstück zu entdecken war. Aber vielleicht und höchstwahrscheinlich waren die zwei jun- gen Leute die Hausdiener, die der Gäste wegen bald aufstehn mußten und deshalb angezogen schliefen. Dann war es allerdings nicht besonders ehrenvoll mit ihnen zu schlafen, aber desto ungefährlicher. Nur durfe er sich aber, solange das wenigstens nicht außer jedem Zweifel war, auf keinen Fall zum Schlafe niederlegen.","He soon realized that, apart from the fact that there was no other place to sleep, neither a couch nor a sofa, he would not be able to get any sleep, for he was allowed to bring his trunk, which he had just recovered, and the money he was carrying with him , do not expose yourself to danger. But he didn't want to leave either, because he didn't dare leave the house immediately, past the chambermaid and the innkeeper. After all, it wasn't any safer here than on the country road. What was striking, of course, was that there wasn't a single piece of luggage to be seen in the whole room, as far as could be determined in the dim light. But perhaps, and most likely, the two young people were the house servants, who soon had to get up because of the guests and therefore slept fully dressed. Then it wasn't particularly honorable to sleep with them, but all the less dangerous. However, as long as that was at least not beyond all doubt, he must under no circumstances lie down to sleep.","He soon saw that, apart from the lack of anywhere else to sleep, no sofa, no couch, he wouldn’t be able to sleep anyway, because he couldn’t expose his newly returned suitcase and the money he carried on him to any danger. Nor did he want to leave, because he didn’t think he could slip past the woman and the landlord and leave the building unnoticed. But surely he wouldn’t be at greater risk here than on the open road. There was, though, as far as he could tell in the half-light, a striking absence of any other luggage in the room. Perhaps the likeliest solution was that these two were house-servants, who would have to get up soon to look after the guests, and therefore slept in their clothes. In which case he wasn’t in particularly prestigious company, but at least he was safe. But so long as there was any doubt about it, he mustn’t go to sleep.","He soon realized that, aside from the fact that there was no other place to sleep, neither a settee nor a sofa, he would get no sleep, for he ought not to jeopardize his trunk, which he had only just recovered, as well as the money he was carrying. Nor did he want to go away, for he dared not go past the chambermaid and the landlord and leave the inn so soon. Finally, it was perhaps no less unsafe here than out on the country road. But it was remarkable that there was no sign of a single piece of luggage in the entire room, at least so far as one could make out in the twilight. But perhaps, and this was most likely, the two young people were house servants, who would soon have to rise to prepare for the guests and therefore slept fully clothed. So while there was no special honor in sleeping with them, there was no danger in it either. Still, he should certainly not lie down to sleep until all such doubts had been resolved."
"„Eine ruhigere Gegend kann man sich gar nicht wün- schen"", sagte Delamarche. „Am Abend ist paar Stunden lang großer Lärm, aber während des Tages geht es hier musterhaf zu."" Karl nickte, ihm schien die Ruhe zu groß zu sein. „Ich könnte gar nicht anderswo wohnen"", sagte Delamarche, „denn Brunelda verträgt absolut kei- nen Lärm. Kennst Du Brunelda? Nun Du wirst sie ja sehn. Jedenfalls empfehle ich Dir, Dich möglichst still aufzuführen.""","""You couldn't ask for a quieter place,"" said Delamarche. ""It's noisy for a few hours in the evening, but it's exemplary during the day."" Karl nodded, the calm seemed to be too much for him. ""I couldn't live anywhere else,"" said Delamarche, ""because Brunelda doesn't tolerate any noise at all. Do you know Brunelda? Well, you'll see her. In any case, I recommend that you behave as quietly as possible.""","‘One really couldn’t wish for a quieter neighbourhood than this,’ said Delamarche. ‘It’s very noisy for a couple of hours in the evening but during the daytime it’s exemplary.’ Karl nodded, the quiet seemed a little excessive to him. ‘I couldn’t live anywhere else,’ said Delamarche, ‘because Brunelda is terribly sensitive to the slightest noise. Have you met Brunelda? Well, you will soon. I would urge you to be as quiet as possible when you’re with her.’","“One certainly couldn’t ask for a quieter neighborhood,” said Delamarche. “For a couple of hours in the evening there’s a great deal of noise, but by day it’s ideal.” Karl nodded; it was too quiet, he thought to himself. “I certainly couldn’t live anywhere else,” said Delamarche, “since Brunelda can’t tolerate the slightest noise. You know Brunelda? Well, you’ll be seeing her. But I would urge you to be as quiet as possible.”"
"„Wer sind Sie?"" fragte der Diener und hielt Karl die Laterne ans Gesicht, wodurch er gleichzeitig sein eigenes beleuchtete. Sein Gesicht erschien etwas steif durch ei- nen großen weißen Vollbart der erst auf der Brust in seidenartige Ringel ausgieng. Es muß ein treuer Diener sein, dem man das Tragen eines solchen Bartes erlaubt, dachte Karl und sah diesen Bart unverwandt der Länge und Breite nach an, ohne sich dadurch behindert zu füh- len, daß er selbst beobachtet wurde. Im übrigen antwor- tete er sofort, daß er der Gast des Herrn Pollunder sei, aus seinem Zimmer in das Speisezimmer gehen wolle und es nicht finden könne. „Ach so"", sagte der Diener, wir haben das elektrische Licht noch nicht eingeführt."" Ich weiß"", sagte Karl. „Wollen Sie sich nicht Ihre Kerze an meiner Lampe anzünden?"" fragte der Diener. Bitte"", sagte Karl und tat es. „Es zieht hier so auf den Gängen"", sagte der Diener, „die Kerze löscht leicht aus, darum habe ich eine Laterne."" „Ja eine Laterne ist viel praktischer"", sagte Karl. „Sie sind auch schon von der Kerze ganz betropf"", sagte der Diener und leuchtete mit der Kerze Karls Anzug ab. „Das habe ich ja gar nicht bemerkt"", rief Karl und es tat ihm sehr leid, da es ein schwarzer Anzug war, von dem der Onkel gesagt hatte, er passe ihm am besten von allen. Die Rauferei mit Klara dürfe dem Anzug auch nicht genützt haben, erin- nerte er sich jetzt. Der Diener war gefällig genug, den Anzug zu reinigen so gut es in der Eile gieng; immer wieder drehte sich Karl vor ihm herum und zeigte ihm noch hier und dort einen Flecken, den der Diener folg- sam entfernte. „Warum zieht es denn hier eigentlich so?"" fragte Karl, als sie schon weitergiengen. „Es ist hier eben noch viel zu bauen"", sagte der Diener, „man hat zwar mit dem Umbau schon angefangen, aber es geht sehr langsam. Jetzt streiken auch noch die Bauarbeiter wie Sie vielleicht wissen. Man hat viel Ärger mit so ei- nem Bau. Jetzt sind da paar große Durchbrüche gemacht worden, die niemand vermauert und die Zugluf geht durch das ganze Haus. Wenn ich nicht die Ohren voll Watte hätte, könnte ich nicht bestehn."" „Da muß ich wohl lauter reden?"" fragte Karl. „Nein, Sie haben eine klare Stimme"", sagte der Diener. „Aber um auf diesen Bau zurückzukommen, besonders hier in der Nähe der Kapelle, die später unbedingt von dem übrigen Haus abgesperrt werden muß, ist die Zugluf gar nicht auszu- halten."" „Die Brüstung, an der man in diesem Gang vorüberkommt geht also in eine Kapelle hinaus?"" „Ja."" „Das habe ich mir gleich gedacht"", sagte Karl. „Sie ist sehr sehenswert"", sagte der Diener, „wäre sie nicht ge- wesen, hätte wohl Herr Mack das Haus nicht gekauf."" „Herr Mack?"" fragte Karl, „ich dachte, das Haus gehöre Herrn Pollunder."" „Allerdings"", sagte der Diener, „aber Herr Mack hat doch bei diesem Kauf den Ausschlag gegeben. Sie kennen Herrn Mack nicht?"" „O ja"", sagte Karl. „Aber in welcher Verbindung ist er denn mit Herrn Pollunder?"" „Er ist der Bräutigam des Fräu- leins"", sagte der Diener. „Das wußte ich freilich nicht"", sagte Karl und blieb stehn. „Setzt Sie das in solches Erstaunen?"" fragte der Diener. „Ich will es nur mir zu- rechtlegen. Wenn man solche Beziehungen nicht kennt, kann man ja die größten Fehler machen"", antwortete Karl. „Es wundert mich nur, daß man Ihnen davon nichts gesagt hat"", sagte der Diener. „Ja wirklich"", sagte Karl beschämt. „Wahrscheinlich dachte man, Sie wüßten es"", sagte der Diener, „es ist ja keine Neuigkeit. Hier sind wir übrigens"", und er öffnete eine Tür, hinter der sich eine Treppe zeigte, die senkrecht zu der Hintertüre des ebenso wie bei der Ankunf hell beleuchteten Speise- zimmers führte. Ehe Karl in das Speisezimmer eintrat, aus dem man die Stimmen Herrn Pollunders und Herrn Greens unverändert wie vor nun wohl schon zwei Stun- den hörte, sagte der Diener: „Wenn Sie wollen, erwarte ich Sie hier und führe Sie dann in Ihr Zimmer. Es macht immerhin Schwierigkeiten, sich gleich am ersten Abend hier auszukennen."" „Ich werde nicht mehr in mein Zim- mer zurückgehn"", sagte Karl und wußte nicht warum er bei dieser Auskunf traurig wurde, „Es wird nicht so arg sein"", sagte der Diener ein wenig überlegen lächelnd und klopfe ihm auf den Arm. Er hatte sich wahrscheinlich Karls Worte dahin erklärt, daß Karl beabsichtige, wäh- rend der ganzen Nacht im Speisezimmer zu bleiben, sich mit den Herren zu unterhalten und mit ihnen zu trinken. Karl wollte jetzt keine Bekenntnisse machen, außerdem dachte er, der Diener, der ihm besser gefiel als die andern hiesigen Diener, könne ihm ja dann die Wegrichtung nach New York zeigen und sagte deshalb: „Wenn Sie hier warten wollen, so ist das sicherlich eine große Freundlichkeit von Ihnen und ich nehme sie dankbar an. Jedenfalls werde ich in einer kleinen Weile herauskom- men und Ihnen dann sagen, was ich weiter tun werde. Ich denke schon, daß mir Ihre Hilfe noch nötig sein wird."" „Gut"", sagte der Diener, stellte die Laterne auf den Boden und setzte sich auf ein niedriges Postament, dessen Leere wahrscheinlich auch mit dem Umbau des Hauses zusammenhieng, „ich werde also hier warten."" „Die Kerze können Sie auch bei mir lassen"", sagte der Diener noch, als Karl mit der brennenden Kerze in den Saal gehen wollte. „Ich bin aber zerstreut"", sagte Karl und reichte die Kerze dem Diener hin, welcher ihm bloß zunickte, ohne daß man wußte, ob er es mit Absicht tat oder ob es eine Folge dessen war, daß er mit der Hand seinen Bart strich.","""Who are you?"" asked the servant and held the lantern to Karl's face, which at the same time illuminated his own. His face appeared a bit stiff due to a large white full beard that ended in silky rings on the chest. It must be a true one To be a servant who is allowed to wear such a beard, Karl thought, and looked steadily at the length and breadth of this beard, not feeling bothered by the fact that he was being watched himself he was Herr Pollunder's guest, wanted to go out of his room into the dining room and couldn't find it. ""Oh,"" said the servant, ""we haven't introduced the electric light yet."" I know,"" said Karl. ""Wouldn't you like to light your candle from my lamp?"" asked the servant. Please,"" said Karl and did so. ""It's so drafty here in the corridors,"" said the servant, ""the candle goes out easily, so I have a lantern."" ""Yes, a lantern is much more practical,"" said Karl. ""You're already dripping from the candle,"" said the servant and lit Karl's suit with the candle. ""I didn't even notice that,"" Karl exclaimed, and he was very sorry because it was a black suit, which his uncle had said fit him best of all. The suit wasn't allowed to fight with Klara either He remembered now that the servant was kind enough to clean the suit as best he could in a hurry; Karl kept turning around in front of him and showing him a spot here and there, which the servant followed - sam removed. ""Why is it so drafty here?"" Karl asked when they were already walking on. ""There's still a lot to be built here,"" said the servant, ""the conversion has already started, but it's going very slowly. Now the construction workers are also on strike, as you may know. It's a lot of trouble with a A building. Now there have been a couple of big breakthroughs that nobody is bricking up and the draft goes through the whole house. If I didn't have my ears full of cotton wool, I couldn't survive."" ""I guess I have to speak louder then?"" asked Karl. ""No, you have a clear voice,"" said the servant. ""But to come back to this building, especially here in the vicinity of the chapel, which must later be blocked off from the rest of the house, the drafts are unbearable."" out into a chapel?"" ""Yes."" ""I thought so right away,"" said Karl. ""It's very well worth seeing,"" said the servant, ""if it hadn't been for it Mr. Mack probably wouldn't have bought the house."" ""Mr. Mack?"" asked Karl, ""I thought the house belonged to Mr. Pollunder."" ""Certainly,"" said the servant, ""but Herr Mack was the deciding factor in this purchase. You don't know Herr Mack?"" ""Oh yes,"" said Karl. ""But what is his connection with Herr Pollunder?"" ""He's the bridegroom of the young lady,"" said the servant. ""Of course I didn't know that,"" said Karl and stopped. ""Does that surprise you so much?"" asked the servant. ""I just want to figure it out myself. If you don't know such relationships, you can make the biggest mistakes,"" answered Karl. ""I'm just surprised they didn't tell you anything about it,"" said the servant. ""Yes, really,"" said Karl, ashamed. ""They probably thought you knew,"" said the servant, ""it's nothing new. Here we are, by the way,"" and he opened a door behind which was a stairway, perpendicular to the back door of the as well as that Arrival brightly lit dining room. Before Karl entered the dining room, from which the voices of Mr. Pollunder and Mr. Green could be heard, the same as they had been for two hours, the servant said: ""If you like, I'll wait for you here and then take you to your room. After all, it's difficult to find your way around here on the first evening."" ""I won't go back to my room,"" said Karl and didn't know why he was sad at this information. ""It won't be so bad,"" said the servant smiled a little superiorly and patted his arm. He had probably interpreted Karl's words as meaning that Karl intended to stay in the dining room the whole night, to talk to the gentlemen and to drink with them. Karl didn't want to make any confessions now, besides, he thought the servant, whom he liked better than the other servants here, could show him the way to New York, so he said: ""If you want to wait here, it's certainly a big one Kindness of yours, and I accept it gratefully. Anyway, I'll come out in a little while and tell you what I'm going to do next. I think I'll need your help."" ""Good,"" said the servant, putting the lantern on the floor and sitting down on a low pedestal, the emptiness of which was probably also due to the renovation of the house, ""so I'll wait here."" ""You can also leave the candle with me,"" the servant said when Karl wanted to go into the hall with the burning candle. ""But I'm distracted,"" said Karl and handed the candle to the servant, who just nodded to him. without knowing whether he did it on purpose or whether it was a consequence of stroking his beard with his hand.","‘Who are you?’ asked the retainer and held the lantern in Karl’s face, thereby simultaneously lighting up his own. His face seemed rather stiff on account of a long white beard which only broke up into silky ringlets when it hit his chest. He must be a trusty servant to be allowed to wear such a beard, thought Karl, and he stared at its length and breadth, without being inhibited by the fact that he was being stared at himself. He replied right away that he was a guest of Mr Pollunder’s, that he had left his own room to go back to the dining-room, but had been unable to find it. ‘ Oh yes,’ said the servant, ‘we haven’t introduced electric light yet.’ ‘I know,’ said Karl. ‘wouldn’t you care to light your candle at my lantern?’ asked the servant. ‘ Yes please,’ said Karl, and did so. ‘There is such a draught in the corridors,’ said the servant, ‘a candle is easily extinguished, and so I have a lantern.’ ‘Yes, a lantern is far more practical,’ said Karl. ‘You’re all spattered with wax too,’ said the servant, passing the lantern over Karl’s suit. ‘I never noticed that,’ said Karl, and he was very sorry as it was his black suit, which his uncle had said fitted him best of all his suits. The fight with Klara couldn’t have done much for the suit either, he now thought. The servant was kind enough to give the suit a quick clean; Karl kept turning round in front of him, drawing more stains to his attention, which the servant duly removed. ‘Why is there such a draught here?’ asked Karl, once they were on their way again. ‘There’s a lot of building work still to be done,’ said the servant, ‘they’ve begun on the conversion, but it’s going very slowly. And now the building workers have gone on strike, maybe you’ve heard. A building job like that is nothing but trouble. They’ve made a couple of major openings, but there’s no one to wall them up, and so there’s a draught all over the house. If I didn’t have cotton wool in my ears, I wouldn’t be able to survive.’ ‘Would you like me to speak up?’ said Karl. ‘No, your voice is very clear,’ said the servant. ‘But to get back to the building, the draught is quite intolerable, especially here in the vicinity of the chapel, which will certainly have to be separated from the rest of the house later.’ ‘So the balustrade you pass in this corridor opens out into the chapel?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘I thought so right away,’ said Karl. ‘It’s well worth seeing,’ said the servant. ‘If it hadn’t been there, I doubt whether Mr Mack would have bought the house.’ ‘Mr Mack?’ asked Karl, ‘I thought the house belonged to Mr Pollunder.’ ‘Yes, it does,’ said the servant, ‘but Mr Mack was the moving force behind the purchase. Do you not know Mr Mack?’ ‘Yes I do,’ said Karl. ‘But what is his relationship with Mr Pollunder?’ ‘He is the young lady’s intended,’ said the servant. ‘I had no idea of that,’ said Karl, and stopped. ‘Does it come as such a surprise to you?’ asked the servant. ‘I just want to take account of it. If you’re not aware of such relationships, you can make very serious blunders,’ replied Karl. ‘I’m surprised you weren’t informed about it,’ said the servant ‘ No I wasn’t,’ said Karl, embarrassed. ‘They probably thought you knew about it,’ said the servant, ‘it’s not a recent development. By the way, we’ve arrived,’ and he opened a door, behind which a flight of steps led steeply down to the back door of the dining-room, which was brightly lit, as it had been on their arrival. Before Karl had entered the dining-room, from which the voices of Mr Green and Mr Pollunder could be heard, as they could two hours previously, the servant said: ‘If you like, I’ll wait here for you, and take you back to your room. It is difficult to find your way around on your first evening with us.’ ‘I won’t be going back to my room,’ said Karl, and he didn’t know why the statement made him feel sad. ‘ Surely it’s not that bad,’ said the servant, smiling in a gently superior way and patting him on the arm. He probably took Karl to mean that he intended to spend the whole night in the dining-room, talking and drinking with the gentlemen. Karl didn’t want to make any admissions, and besides, he thought this servant, whom he liked better than any of the others, might be able to show him the way to New York later, and so he said: ‘If you wouldn’t mind waiting here, that would be very kind of you, and I’m happy to accept. I’ll be out in a little while, and tell you what’s to be done then. I think I’ll be needing your help.’ ‘Very good,’ said the servant, and set the lantern down on the floor and seated himself on a low plinth, whose unoccupied condition was probably something to do with the conversion of the house, ‘I’ll be waiting for you here.’ ‘You can leave the candle with me too,’ he added, as Karl was about to enter the salon with his burning candle in his hand. ‘I am being absent-minded,’ said Karl, and passed the candle to the servant, who merely nodded to him, although it wasn’t clear whether it was deliberate, or merely the result of stroking his beard.","“Who are you?” asked the servant, raising the lantern to Karl’s face and thereby illuminating his own. His face seemed rather stiff on account of his large white full beard, which reached down to his chest, where it tapered off in silky ringlets. He must be a faithful servant if he’s allowed to wear a beard like that, thought Karl, continually gazing up and down the length of the beard without feeling hampered by the scrutiny that he himself was undergoing. Besides, he responded at once, saying he was a guest of Mr. Pollunder’s and simply wanted to go from his room to the dining room but had not succeeded in finding it. “I see,” said the servant, “we still haven’t installed electric lighting.” “I know,” said Karl. “Don’t you want to use my lamp to light your candle,” the servant asked. “Yes, please,” said Karl, and did so. “It’s so drafty out here in the corridors,” said the servant, “the candle can easily get blown out, and that’s why I have a lantern.” “Yes, a lantern is much more practical,” said Karl. “You’re covered in candle drippings,” said the servant, illuminating Karl’s suit with the candle. “I hadn’t even noticed,” cried Karl, much to his regret, for it was a black outfit that, according to his uncle, suited him best. The scuffle with Klara could scarcely have done the suit any good, it occurred to him. The servant was kind enough to clean off the suit as best he could in his haste; Karl turned around in front of him to show him scattered stains, which the servant obediently removed. “Why is there such a draft,” asked Karl once they had started moving again. “There’s still a great deal of construction left to be done,” said the servant, “they’ve started work on the renovations, but it’s going very slowly. And besides all that, the construction workers have now gone on strike, as you may know. There’s always trouble with that kind of construction. There are several large gaps that haven’t been walled up, and the draft blows right through the house. I couldn’t survive it here if I didn’t have my ears stuffed with cotton.” “Then I should probably raise my voice?” asked Karl. “Your voice is perfectly clear,” said the servant. “But to return to the construction, the draft out here is quite intolerable, especially near the chapel, which will eventually have to be closed off from the rest of the house.” “So the balustrade along this corridor opens out into a chapel?” “Yes.” “Just as I thought,” said Karl. “It’s well worth seeing,” said the servant, “if it weren’t for the chapel, Mr. Mack probably wouldn’t have bought the house.” “Mr. Mack?” asked Karl, “I thought the house belonged to Mr. Pollunder.” “Yes, of course,” said the servant, “but Mr. Mack played the decisive role in purchasing it. You don’t know Mr. Mack?” “Oh yes,” said Karl. “But what’s the connection between him and Mr. Pollunder?” “He’s Miss Klara’s fiancé,” said the servant. “That I didn’t know,” said Karl, and he stopped. “Is that so surprising to you?” “I just want to let it sink in. One can make the greatest mistakes if one isn’t aware of such relationships,” replied Karl. “I’m just surprised they didn’t let you know,” said the servant. “Well, yes,” said Karl, sounding embarrassed. “They probably thought you already knew,” said the servant, “after all, it’s not exactly news. Besides, here we are,” and he opened a door, exposing stairs that led directly up to the back door of the dining room, which was as brightly illuminated as it had been upon Karl’s arrival. Before entering the dining room, from which the voices of Mr. Pollunder and Mr. Green still emanated just as they had some two hours previously, the servant said: “If you like, I shall wait for you here, and then I shall take you to your room. On one’s first evening here, it’s always difficult to find one’s way about.” “I shall not be going back to my room,” said Karl, without quite knowing why it made him sad to say so. “It won’t be that bad,” said the servant, patting him on the arm and smiling somewhat condescendingly. He had probably thought that Karl meant he wanted to spend all night in the dining room, talking and drinking with these gentlemen. Karl had no desire to make any confession just now; besides, he thought that this servant, whom he preferred to the other servants here, could show him how to get to New York, and he therefore said: “If you’re willing to wait, that would be most kind of you, and I gratefully accept your offer. I certainly shall come out again in a little while and tell you what I intend to do. I’m quite sure I’ll still need your help.” “Fine,” said the servant, placing the lantern on the floor and seating himself on a low pedestal, which was empty probably on account of the renovations, “so I’ll wait here. By the way, you may leave the candle with me,” added the servant as Karl was about to enter the room with the lighted candle. “I’m so distracted,” said Karl, handing the candle to the servant, who merely nodded to him, though one could not tell whether this was deliberate or whether it came from the way he shook his head."
Sie fuhren zwei Tage …,They drove two days...,They rode for two days and two nights.,They traveled for two days and two nights.
"Einmal erzählte Terese – Karl stand neben ihr beim Fenster und sah auf die Straße – vom Tode ihrer Mutter. Wie die Mutter und sie an einem Winterabend – sie konnte damals etwa fünf Jahre alt gewesen sein – jede mit ihrem Bündel durch die Straßen eilten, um Schlaf- stellen zu suchen. Wie die Mutter sie zuerst bei der Hand führte, es war ein Schneesturm und nicht leicht vorwärtszukommen, bis die Hand erlahmte und sie Te- rese ohne sich nach ihr umzusehn losließ, die sich nun Mühe geben mußte, sich selbst an den Röcken der Mut- ter festzuhalten. Of stolperte Terese und fiel sogar, aber die Mutter war wie in einem Wahn und hielt nicht an. Und diese Schneestürme in den langen geraden Newyorker Straßen! Karl hatte noch keinen Winter in Newyork mitgemacht. Geht man gegen den Wind, und der dreht sich im Kreise, kann man keinen Augenblick die Augen öffnen, immerfort zerreibt einem der Wind den Schnee auf dem Gesicht, man lauf aber kommt nicht weiter, es ist etwas Verzweifeltes. Ein Kind ist dabei natürlich gegen Erwachsene im Vorteil, es lauf unter dem Wind durch und hat noch ein wenig Freude an allem. So hatte auch damals Terese ihre Mutter nicht ganz begreifen können und sie war fest davon überzeugt, daß, wenn sie sich an jenem Abend klüger – sie war eben noch ein so kleines Kind – zu ihrer Mutter verhalten hätte, diese nicht einen so jammervollen Tod hätte erlei- den müssen. Die Mutter war damals schon zwei Tage ohne Arbeit gewesen, nicht das kleinste Geldstück war mehr vorhanden, der Tag war ohne einen Bissen im Freien verbracht worden und in ihren Bündeln schlepp- ten sie nur unbrauchbare Fetzen mit sich herum, die sie vielleicht aus Aberglauben sich nicht wegzuwerfen ge- trauten. Nun war der Mutter für den nächsten Morgen Arbeit bei einem Bau in Aussicht gestellt worden, aber sie fürchtete wie sie Terese den ganzen Tag über zu erklären suchte, die günstige Gelegenheit nicht ausnüt- zen zu können, denn sie fühlte sich totmüde, hatte schon am Morgen zum Schrecken der Passanten auf der Gasse viel Blut gehustet, und ihre einzige Sehnsucht war, ir- gendwo in die Wärme zu kommen und sich auszuruhn. Und gerade an diesem Abend war es unmöglich ein Plätzchen zu bekommen. Dort wo sie nicht schon vom Hausbesorger aus dem Torgang gewiesen wurden, in dem man sich immerhin vom Wetter ein wenig hätte erholen können, durcheilten sie die engen eisigen Korri- dore, durchstiegen die hohen Stockwerke, umkreisten die schmalen Terassen der Höfe, klopfen wahllos an Türen, wagten einmal niemanden anzusprechen, baten dann jeden der ihnen entgegenkam und einmal oder zweimal hockte die Mutter atemlos auf der Stufe einer stillen Treppe nieder, riß Terese, die sich fast wehrte, an sich und küßte sie mit schmerzhafem Anpressen der Lippen. Wenn man nachher weiß, daß das die letzten Küsse waren, begreif man nicht, daß man, und mag man ein kleiner Wurm gewesen sein, so blind sein konnte, das nicht einzusehn. In manchen Zimmern an denen sie vor- überkamen, waren die Türen geöffnet um eine ersticken- de Luf herauszulassen und aus dem rauchigen Dunst, der wie durch einen Brand verursacht die Zimmer erfüll- te, trat nur die Gestalt irgendjemandes hervor, der im Türrahmen stand und entweder durch seine stumme Ge- genwart oder durch ein kurzes Wort die Unmöglichkeit eines Unterkommens in dem betreffenden Zimmer be- wies. Terese schien es jetzt im Rückblick, daß die Mut- ter nur in den ersten Stunden ernstlich einen Platz such- te, denn nachdem etwa Mitternacht vorüber war, hat sie wohl niemanden mehr angesprochen, trotzdem sie mit kleinen Pausen bis zur Morgendämmerung nicht auför- te weiterzueilen und trotzdem in diesen Häusern, in de- nen weder Haustore noch Wohnungstüren je verschlos- sen werden, immerfort Leben ist und einem Menschen auf Schritt und Tritt begegnen. Natürlich war es kein Laufen, das sie rasch weiterbrachte, sondern es war nur die äußerste Anstrengung deren sie fähig waren, und es konnte in Wirklichkeit ganz gut auch bloß ein Schlei- chen sein. Terese wußte auch nicht, ob sie von Mitter- nacht bis fünf Uhr früh in zwanzig Häusern oder in zwei oder gar nur in einem Haus gewesen waren. Die Korridore dieser Häuser sind nach schlauen Plänen der besten Raumausnützung aber ohne Rücksicht auf leichte Orientierung angelegt, wie of waren sie wohl durch die gleichen Korridore gekommen! Terese hatte wohl in dunkler Erinnerung, daß sie das Tor eines Hauses, das sie ewig durchsucht hatten, wieder verließen, aber eben- so schien es ihr, daß sie auf der Gasse gleich gewendet und wieder in dieses Haus sich gestürzt hätten. Für das Kind war es natürlich ein unbegreifliches Leid, einmal von der Mutter gehalten, einmal sich an ihr festhaltend, ohne ein kleines Wort des Trostes mitgeschleif zu wer- den, und das Ganze schien damals für seinen Unver- stand nur die Erklärung zu haben, daß die Mutter von ihm weglaufen wolle. Darum hielt sich Terese desto fester, selbst wenn die Mutter sie an einer Hand hielt, der Sicherheit halber auch noch mit der andern Hand an den Röcken der Mutter und heulte in Abständen. Sie wollte nicht hier zurückgelassen werden, zwischen den Leuten, die vor ihnen die Treppen stampfend emporstie- gen, die hinter ihnen, noch nicht zu sehn, hinter einer Wendung der Treppe herankamen, die in den Gängen vor einer Tür Streit mit einander hatten und einander gegenseitig in das Zimmer hineinstießen. Betrunkene wanderten mit dumpfem Gesang im Haus umher und glücklich schlüpfe noch die Mutter mit Terese durch solche sich gerade schließende Gruppen. Gewiß hätten sie spät in der Nacht, wo man nicht mehr so acht gab und niemand mehr unbedingt auf seinem Recht bestand, wenigstens in einen der allgemeinen von Unternehmern vermieteten Schlafsäle sich drängen können, an deren einigen sie vorüberkamen, aber Terese verstand es nicht und die Mutter wollte keine Ruhe mehr. Am Morgen, dem Beginn eines schönen Wintertags, lehnten sie beide an einer Hausmauer und hatten dort vielleicht ein wenig geschlafen, vielleicht nur mit offenen Augen herumge- starrt. Es zeigte sich, daß Terese ihr Bündel verloren hatte, und die Mutter machte sich daran, Terese zur Strafe für die Unachtsamkeit zu schlagen, aber Terese hörte keinen Schlag und spürte keinen. Sie giengen dann weiter durch die sich belebenden Gassen, die Mutter an der Mauer, kamen über eine Brücke, wo die Mutter mit der Hand den Reif vom Geländer streife und gelangten schließlich, damals hatte es Terese hingenommen, heu- te verstand sie es nicht, gerade zu jenem Bau, zu dem die Mutter für jenen Morgen bestellt war. Sie sagte Terese nicht, ob sie warten oder weggehn solle, und Terese nahm dies als Befehl zum Warten, da dies ihren Wün- schen am besten entsprach. Sie setzte sich also auf einen Ziegelhaufen und sah zu, wie die Mutter ihr Bündel auf- schnürte, einen bunten Fetzen herausnahm und damit ihr Kopfuch umband, das sie während der ganzen Nacht getragen hatte. Terese war zu müde, als daß ihr auch nur der Gedanke gekommen wäre, der Mutter zu helfen. Ohne sich in der Bauhütte zu melden, wie dies üblich war, und ohne jemanden zu fragen, stieg die Mut- ter eine Leiter hinauf, als wisse sie schon selbst welche Arbeit ihr zugeteilt war. Terese wunderte sich darüber, da die Handlangerinnen gewöhnlich nur unten mit Kalklöschen, mit dem Hinreichen der Ziegel und mit sonstigen einfachen Arbeiten beschäfigt werden. Sie dachte daher, die Mutter wolle heute eine besser bezahl- te Arbeit ausführen und lächelte verschlafen zu ihr hin- auf. Der Bau war noch nicht hoch, kaum bis zum Erdge- schoß gediehn, wenn auch schon die hohen Gerüststan- gen für den weitern Bau, allerdings noch ohne Verbin- dungshölzer, zum blauen Himmel ragten. Oben um- gieng die Mutter geschickt die Maurer die Ziegel auf Ziegel legten und sie unbegreiflicher Weise nicht zur Rede stellten, sie hielt sich vorsichtig mit zarter Hand an einem Holzverschlag der als Geländer diente und Tere- se staunte unten in ihrem Dusel diese Geschicklichkeit an und glaubte noch einen freundlichen Blick der Mutter erhalten zu haben. Nun kam aber die Mutter auf ihrem Gang zu einem kleinen Ziegelhaufen, vor dem das Ge- länder und wahrscheinlich auch der Weg auförte, aber sie hielt sich nicht daran, gieng auf den Ziegelhaufen los, ihre Geschicklichkeit schien sie verlassen zu haben, sie stieß den Ziegelhaufen um und fiel über ihn hinweg in die Tiefe. Viele Ziegel rollten ihr nach und schließlich eine ganze Weile später löste sich irgendwo ein schweres Brett los und krachte auf sie nieder. Die letzte Erinne- rung Tereses an ihre Mutter war, wie sie mit auseinan- dergestreckten Beinen dalag in dem karierten Rock, der noch aus Pommern stammte, wie jenes auf ihr liegende rohe Brett sie fast bedeckte, wie nun die Leute von allen Seiten zusammenliefen und wie oben vom Bau irgendein Mann zornig etwas hinunterrief.","Once Terese told - Karl was standing next to her at the window and looked at the street - about the death of her mother. How she and her mother—she might have been about five years old at the time—each hurrying through the streets with her bundle one winter evening to look for places to sleep. How the mother first led her by the hand, it was a snowstorm and it was not easy to move forward, until the hand weakened and she let go of Terese without looking back at her, who now had to make an effort to grab the mother's skirts herself. to hold on to. Terese often stumbled and even fell, but the mother was mad and didn't stop. And those blizzards in the long straight New York streets! Karl had never been through a winter in New York. If you walk against the wind, and it turns in circles, you can't open your eyes for a moment, the wind keeps grinding the snow on your face, you run but you don't get any further, it's something desperate. Of course, a child has an advantage over adults, it runs under the wind and still enjoys a little bit of everything. At the time, Terese had not been able to fully understand her mother either, and she was firmly convinced that if she had behaved wiserly that evening - she was just such a small child - towards her mother, she would not have had such a miserable death have to suffer. The mother had been without work for two days by then, there wasn't the tiniest bit of money left, the day had been spent outdoors without a bite and in their bundles they only carried around useless rags, which they might have bought out of superstition dared not throw away. Now the mother had been given the prospect of work on a building site for the next morning, but she was afraid, as she tried to explain to Terese all day long, that she would not be able to take advantage of the favorable opportunity, because she felt dead tired, had already started In the morning, to the horror of passers-by, she coughed up a lot of blood in the street, and her only longing was to get somewhere warm and rest. And just that evening it was impossible to get a seat. Wherever the caretaker hadn't shown them out of the doorway, where one could at least have had a little rest from the weather, they hurried through the narrow, icy corridors, climbed the high floors, circled the narrow terraces of the courtyards, and knocked indiscriminately Doors once didn't dare speak to anyone, then begged anyone who came towards them and once or twice the mother crouched down breathless on the step of a silent staircase, grabbed Terese, who was almost resisting, and kissed her with painfully pressed lips. When you know afterwards that those were the last kisses, you don't understand that, even if you were a little worm, you could have been so blind as not to see it. In some of the rooms they passed, the doors were open to let out a suffocating air, and out of the smoky haze that filled the rooms as if caused by fire, only the figure of someone standing in the doorway emerged and either by his mute presence or by a short word proved the impossibility of staying in the room in question. In retrospect it now seemed to Terese that her mother was only seriously looking for a place for the first few hours, because after about midnight she probably didn't speak to anyone, although she didn't stop with short breaks until dawn to hurry on and nevertheless in these houses, in which neither the house gates nor the apartment doors are ever locked, there is always life and you meet people at every turn. Of course, it wasn't running that got them going quickly, it was only the utmost exertion of which they were capable, and in fact it might as well just be sneaking. Terese didn't know either whether they had been in twenty houses or in two or even just one house from midnight until five in the morning. The corridors of these houses are laid out according to clever plans for the best use of space, but with no regard for easy orientation, how often did they come through the same corridors! Terese had a vague memory of them leaving the gate of a house they had searched forever, but it also seemed to her that they turned around in the street and threw themselves back into this house. For the child it was of course an incomprehensible suffering, once held by the mother, once holding on to her without being dragged along with a little word of comfort, and the whole thing seemed at the time to his incomprehension to have only the explanation that his mother wanted to run away from him. That's why Terese held onto her skirts all the more tightly, even when her mother was holding one hand, to be on the safe side with her other hand and cried at intervals. She didn't want to be left here, among the people who were stomping up the stairs in front of them, who came up behind them, not yet to be seen, around a turn in the stairs, who were arguing in the corridors in front of a door and arguing with each other pushed each other into the room. Drunks wandered around the house singing muffled songs, and Mother and Terese happily slipped through groups that were just closing. Of course they could have crowded into one of the general dormitories rented out by businessmen, some of which they passed, late at night, when people weren't so careful and no one insisted on their rights, but Terese didn't understand it and they didn't Mother didn't want any more rest. In the morning, at the beginning of a beautiful winter's day, they both leaned against a house wall and had maybe slept there a little, maybe just stared around with open eyes. It turned out that Terese had lost her bundle, and the mother set about hitting Terese as punishment for being careless, but Terese didn't hear or feel a hit. They then walked on through the alleys that were becoming more lively, Mother by the wall, came across a bridge where Mother brushed the ring from the railing with her hand and finally arrived, Terese had accepted it then, today she didn’t understand it, to the very building that Mother had been ordered to go to that morning. She did not tell Terese whether to wait or go away, and Terese took this as an order to wait, as that suited her wishes best. So she sat down on a pile of bricks and watched as her mother untied her bundle, took out a brightly colored rag, and used it to tie her headscarf, which she had been wearing all night. Terese was too tired to even think of helping her mother. Without reporting to the worker's hut, as was customary, and without asking anyone, the mother climbed a ladder, as if she already knew what work was assigned to her. Terese was surprised at this, since the helpers are usually only busy downstairs with lime slaking, handing over the bricks and other simple jobs. So she thought her mother wanted to do a better-paying job today and smiled sleepily up at her. The building wasn't high yet, barely reached the ground floor, even though the high scaffolding poles for the further building, albeit still without connecting timbers, towered up to the blue sky. Upstairs, the mother skilfully avoided the bricklayers who laid bricks on bricks and, incomprehensibly, didn't question them, she carefully held onto a wooden crate that served as a railing with a delicate hand and Terese was amazed at this skill and believed to have received a friendly look from his mother. But now the mother came on her way to a small pile of bricks, in front of which the railing and probably also the path ended, but she didn't hold on to it, went towards the pile of bricks, her skill seemed to have deserted her, she pushed it pile of bricks and fell over him into the depths. Lots of bricks rolled after her, and finally, quite a while later, a heavy plank came loose somewhere and crashed down on her. Terese's last memory of her mother was how she lay there with her legs stretched out in the checkered skirt that came from Pomerania, how the raw board lying on her almost covered her, how people now ran together from all sides and how some man shouted down angrily from the burrow upstairs.","Once – Karl was standing next to her at the window, gazing down on the street – Therese had talked about the death of her mother. The way that one winter evening her mother and herself – she must have been five at the time – each carrying a bundle, chased down the street, looking for a place to sleep. The way her mother at first led her by the hand (there was a blizzard and it was hard to make any headway) till her hand relaxed and she let go of Therese without looking to see what became of her, and she had to strive to grab hold of her mother’s skirts. Often Therese stumbled and even fell but her mother seemed possessed and wouldn’t stop. And the snowstorms in the long straight streets of New York! Karl hadn’t experienced a winter in New York. If you walk into a swirling headwind, you can’t open your eyes even for a second, the wind is incessantly rubbing snow in your face, you walk and walk and get nowhere, it’s quite desperate. Of course a child has a certain advantage over a grown-up, it can walk underneath the wind, and is still able to enjoy everything. And so Therese hadn’t quite been able to understand her mother at the time; and she was firmly convinced that if she had behaved more sensibly that evening with her mother – but she was just a little girl – she wouldn’t have had to suffer such a miserable death. Her mother had already been without work for two days, they didn’t have a penny piece, they had spent the day in the open without a bite to eat, and all they had in their bundles were useless rags which they were only afraid to throw away because of superstition. Now her mother had been offered work on a building site the following morning, but as she told Therese all day long, she was afraid she wouldn’t be able to take up this good opportunity because she was dead tired, that morning to the alarm of passers-by on the pavement she had coughed up a lot of blood, and all she wanted was to get in the warm somewhere and rest. But on this one evening it was proving impossible to find a place. Anywhere that the janitor hadn’t evicted them from the doorway of a building, and in which there was at least a little protection from the weather, they would hurry through narrow icy passages, climb long flights of stairs, circle the narrow courtyards, knocking randomly on doors, sometimes not daring to speak, at others asking anyone they met, and once or twice her mother would squat down breathless on the steps in a quiet staircase, pull Therese, in spite of her resistance, to herself, and press her lips against her so hard that it hurt. When she knew later that those were the last kisses, she couldn’t understand how even if she were a little shrimp, she could have been so blind as not to see that. In some of the rooms they passed, the doors were open to let out some suffocating fumes, and from the haze that filled the room like smoke from a fire, a human figure would loom in the doorway, and either with a curt word or by its mute presence communicate the impossibility of finding shelter in that particular room. Looking back it seemed to Therese that her mother had only been serious in her search for the first few hours, because after midnight or thereabouts, she no longer asked anyone, although she didn’t stop rushing around till dawn, with short interruptions, and even though there is always life in those buildings where neither the gates nor the doors to individual rooms are ever locked, and you keep running into people. Of course it wasn’t as though they made much headway with their scurrying about, it was simply the utmost exertion of which they were capable, and perhaps in reality it was no more than a crawl. Nor could Therese be sure whether they had tried their luck in twenty houses between midnight and five o’clock, or two or even just one. The corridors of those tenements are cleverly designed to make the most of the space, but without regard to easy orientation, so how many times they might have gone down the selfsame passages! Therese had a dim memory of leaving the entrance of a building having spent an eternity looking up and down inside it, but she could also remember how they had turned on the pavement, and plunged straight back inside the building again. For the child it was incomprehensible suffering, now held by her mother, now holding on to her, without so much as a comforting word, being dragged along, and in her incomprehension the only explanation she could find for the whole thing was that her mother was trying to run away from her. Therefore Therese held on as hard as she could, even when her mother had her by the hand, she still gripped on to her skirts with her other hand, just to be sure, and cried at intervals. She didn’t want to be abandoned here among the people who stamped up the stairs ahead of them, or came up behind them, still hidden behind a turn in the stairs, who would meet and quarrel in the corridors outside a door, and push one another into rooms. Drunks wandered round the building singing faintly, and Therese and her mother were just able to slip through a group of them as it was closing around them. They could surely, late at night when people weren’t so absolutely insistent on their rights, have found their way into one of the general dormitories, that were rented out by speculators, of which they passed several, but Therese didn’t understand, and her mother didn’t want to rest any more. At daybreak on a fine winter morning, they both leaned against the wall of a house, and perhaps slept a little, perhaps just stared in front of them. It turned out that Therese had lost her bundle, and her mother was going to punish her for her carelessness with a beating, but Therese heard no blows, and could feel none. They went on through streets that were just beginning to wake up, her mother walking by the wall, they crossed a bridge, where her mother’s hand brushed the frost from the railing, and finally, Therese at the time accepted it, today she couldn’t understand it, they arrived at the building site where her mother was supposed to start that morning. She didn’t tell Therese whether she wanted her to wait for her or to go away, and Therese took that as an order to wait, which was what she wanted to do anyway. So she sat down on a pile of bricks and watched as her mother untied her bundle, took out a coloured rag and tied it over the kerchief she had worn all night. Therese was too tired even to think of helping her mother. Without reporting in the site office, as was customary, and without asking anyone, her mother had climbed straight up a ladder, as though she already knew what task had been allotted to her. Therese was puzzled, because women helpers were usually kept on ground level and told to slake lime, pass bricks and do other simple things. So she thought her mother wanted to do some other, better paid form of work today, and she smiled sleepily up at her. The construction was no great height yet, the ground floor was barely completed, though the scaffolding for the upper floors soared up into the blue sky, although as yet without any cross planking. Up there, her mother skilfully went round the masons laying brick on brick, who surprisingly didn’t ask what she was doing, she held delicately on to a wooden crate that served as a railing, and Therese in her doze below, marvelled at the surefootedness of her mother, and thought she caught a friendly glance from her. Then her mother came to a little pile of bricks marking the end of the railing and probably the path as well, but she didn’t stop, she walked up to the bricks, her sure-footedness seemed to have deserted her, she kicked over the bricks and fell with them over the edge. Many bricks fell after her, and some time later a heavy board became detached and crashed down on top of her as well. Therese’s last memory of her mother was of her lying there with legs apart in the checked skirt she had brought with her from Pomerania, the rough plank on top of her, almost covering her, people running together from all directions, and from up on the site some man angrily shouted something.","On one occasion Therese—Karl stood beside her, looking down at the street—spoke of her mother’s death. She described how on a winter’s evening—she must have been about five years old at the time— her mother and she had hurried through the streets looking for a place to sleep, each with her own bundle. And how at first her mother had led her by the hand , for a snowstorm was blowing and it wasn’t easy to move forward, until her hand grew limp and then, without even glancing behind her, she let go of Therese, who then had to struggle to hold on to her mother’s dress. Therese often stumbled and even fell down, but her mother seemed as if in a craze and did not stop. And then those snowstorms blowing across the long, straight New York streets! Karl had not yet experienced a New York winter. When you walk into the wind and it turns in a circle, you cannot open your eyes; the wind continually rubs the snow into your face, you walk on without getting any farther, the situation becomes very desperate. Of course, a child does have an advantage over adults; it can run under the wind and take pleasure in everything. And so even then Therese could not understand her mother and was absolutely convinced that if she had responded more sensibly to her mother that evening—she was still such a small child at the time—her mother wouldn’t have had to endure such a miserable death. She had been out of work for two days; there wasn’t even the smallest coin left in their pockets, they had spent all day outdoors without a bite and carried only useless rags in their bundles, which they dared not throw away, maybe out of superstition. Her mother had been promised work on a construction site, starting the following morning, but as she had sought to explain to Therese all day, she feared she couldn’t seize the opportunity, for she felt dead tired; to the consternation of passersby, she had coughed up a great deal of blood along the way and merely wanted to get into the warmth somewhere and have a good rest. But on that particular evening it was impossible to find such a place. Even in those places where the custodian did not turn them away from the entrance, where one could at least have recuperated from the weather a little, they hurried on through the narrow icy corridors, climbed through the upper stories, went in a circle around the narrow terraces of the courtyards, knocked randomly on doors, at times not daring to approach anyone, at others asking everyone who came along, and once or twice her mother crouched breathlessly on the steps of a quiet staircase, drew over Therese, who almost fought with her, and kissed her, pressing painfully against her lips. On finding out afterward that those were her last kisses, one cannot quite understand how—even if one was only a little mite—one could have been so blind as not to grasp this. In some rooms that they passed the doors had been pushed open to let out the suffocating air, and amid the smoky haze filling the rooms, as though from a fire, one saw entering through the doorway a single isolated figure who indicated, either through his silence or through a few words, that they could not possibly be accommodated in that particular room. In hindsight Therese believed that it was only for the first couple of hours that her mother had made a serious effort to find a place, for she had probably not approached anyone else after midnight, even though she rushed on until dawn, taking only a few breaks and even though there is always life stirring in those buildings where the gates and the apartment doors are never shut and you run into people every step you take. Of course they made rapid progress, not by running but by exerting themselves to the utmost, and in reality they may have been only crawling along. Therese did not know how many buildings they had entered between midnight and five o’clock in the morning, whether it was twenty, or two, or perhaps only a single one. While the corridors of these buildings are cleverly designed to optimize the use of space, they also make it hard to find one’s way; how often must they have passed through those same corridors! Therese did have a dim memory of their going out through the front gate of a building that they had endlessly searched; she also believed that on reaching the street, they turned around at once and rushed back into the same building. For a child this was a source of incomprehensible torment; being dragged along, sometimes with her mother holding her, sometimes holding on to her herself, without ever hearing a consoling word, and the only explanation she could come up with—due to her limited reasoning powers at the time—was that her mother wanted to run away and abandon her. So even when her mother took her by one hand, with her other she still clasped her mother’s skirt for safety’s sake, howling at intervals. She wanted to avoid being left behind among the people stomping up the stairs in front of them, those not yet visible who were approaching around a bend in the staircase, and those who were arguing in the corridor in front of a door and throwing one another into the room. Drunks wandered through the building singing in muffled tones, and the mother and Therese fortunately managed to slip through groups that were slowly closing ranks. Of course, late that night, when people were no longer so alert and no one would have insisted on everything being handled correctly, they could certainly have pushed their way into one of those dormitories rented out by entrepreneurs, but Therese did not understand this and her mother no longer wanted to take a rest. On a beautiful winter morning the two of them leaned against the wall of a house and may even have slept, or perhaps simply gazed about them through wide-open eyes. It became evident that Therese had lost her bundle, and her mother went through the motions of slapping her for her inattentiveness, but Therese could neither hear nor feel the slightest blow. They continued on through the increasingly busy streets; her mother kept close to the wall, they crossed a bridge where her mother brushed the top of the balustrade with one hand and finally reached the construction site— Therese had simply accepted this at the time, but she could not understand it now—at which her mother had been asked to show up that morning. She did not tell Therese whether she should wait there or leave, and Therese took this as a command to wait, since it corresponded most closely to what she herself wished to do. So she sat down on a pile of bricks and watched as her mother undid her bundle, took out a colorful rag, and used it to tie up the scarf she had worn all night. So great was Therese’s weariness that it never even crossed her mind that she might be able to help her mother. Without reporting at the construction hut, as was customary, and without asking anyone, her mother climbed up a ladder as if she already knew which tasks she had been assigned. Therese found this surprising, for the female laborers were generally only put to work down below, slaking lime, passing bricks, and carrying out other such simple tasks. She therefore thought that her mother intended to do better-paying work that day and smiled up at her drowsily. The building was not yet that high, scarcely extending beyond the ground floor, even though one could already see the tall scaffolding rods, which had not yet been tied to the boards, rise up into the blue sky. On reaching the top, her mother nimbly bypassed the bricklayers, who were laying one brick on top of the other and inexplicably failed to challenge her, stretched out her delicate hand carefully so as to be able to hold on to a wooden partition that served as a kind of railing, while in her drowsiness below Therese was astonished by her mother’s nimbleness and believed that her mother had cast another friendly glance at her. But just then her mother reached a pile of bricks where the railing and probably even the gangway itself came to an end, but she ignored this and headed toward the pile of bricks, whereupon her nimbleness seemed to desert her; she knocked over the pile of bricks, fell over it and down into the depths. A large number of bricks came rolling down after her, and finally after quite a while a heavy board somewhere worked itself loose and crashed down upon her. Therese’s last memory of her mother was of her lying there in her checkered skirt, still from Pomerania, of the board lying upon her and almost covering her, of people running over from every direction, and of some man or other up on the building shouting down in anger."
"„So"", sagte der Student und es war nicht ganz klar, ob er in seinem Buche schon wieder las oder nur zerstreut hineinstarrte, „seien Sie froh, daß Sie das Studium aufge- geben haben. Ich selbst studiere schon seit Jahren ei- gentlich nur aus Konsequenz. Befriedigung habe ich we- nig davon und Zukunfsaussichten noch weniger. Was für Aussichten wollte ich denn haben! Amerika ist voll von Schwindeldoktoren.""","""So,"" said the student and it wasn't quite clear whether he was reading his book again or just staring at it absentmindedly, ""be glad you gave up your studies. I've actually been studying for years myself only as a consequence. I get little satisfaction from it and even less prospects for the future. What prospects did I want to have! America is full of phony doctors.""","‘I see,’ said the student, and it wasn’t quite clear whether he’d started reading his book again, or was merely staring at it absent-mindedly, ‘you should be glad you’ve given it up. For some years now I’ve only been studying out of bloody-mindedness. It brings me little satisfaction, and even less in the way of future prospects. What prospects am I supposed to have! America is full of quack doctors.’","“Well,” said the student, and it was not altogether clear whether he had begun to read his book again or was simply gazing at it absently, “you can be happy about having given up your studies. I myself have been studying for years, out of pure single-mindedness. It has given me little satisfaction and even less chance of a decent future. And in any case, what sort of prospects did I really want! America is full of bogus doctors.”"
"„Werden Sie lange hier bleiben?"" fragte sie. „Es ist noch nicht ganz bestimmt"", antwortete Karl, „aber ich denke, ich werde bleiben."" „Das wäre nämlich sehr gut"", sagte sie und fuhr mit dem Taschentuch über ihr Gesicht, „ich bin hier nämlich so allein."" „Das wundert mich"", sagte Karl, „die Frau Oberköchin ist doch sehr freundlich zu Ihnen. Sie behandelt Sie gar nicht wie eine Angestellte. Ich dachte schon, Sie wären verwandt."" Oh nein"", sagte sie, „ich heiße Terese Berchtold, ich bin aus Pommern."" Auch Karl stellte sich vor. Dar- aufin sah sie ihn zum erstenmal voll an, als sei er ihr durch die Namensnennung ein wenig fremder gewor- den. Sie schwiegen ein Weilchen. Dann sagte sie: „Sie dürfen nicht glauben, daß ich undankbar bin. Ohne die Frau Oberköchin stünde es ja mit mir viel schlechter. Ich war früher Küchenmädchen hier im Hotel und schon in großer Gefahr entlassen zu werden, denn ich konnte die schwere Arbeit nicht leisten. Man stellt hier sehr große Ansprüche. Vor einem Monat ist ein Küchen- mädchen nur vor Überanstrengung ohnmächtig gewor- den und vierzehn Tage im Krankenhaus gelegen. Und ich bin nicht sehr stark, ich habe früher viel zu leiden gehabt und bin dadurch in der Entwicklung ein wenig zurückgeblieben, Sie würden wohl gar nicht sagen, daß ich schon achtzehn Jahre alt bin. Aber jetzt werde ich schon stärker."" „Der Dienst hier muß wirklich sehr an- strengend sein"", sagte Karl. „Unten habe ich jetzt einen Lifjungen stehend schlafen gesehn."" „Dabei haben es die Lifjungen noch am besten"", sagte sie, „die verdienen ihr schönes Geld an Trinkgeldern und müssen sich schließlich doch bei weitem nicht so plagen wie die Leu- te in der Küche. Aber da habe ich wirklich einmal Glück gehabt, die Frau Oberköchin hat einmal ein Mädchen gebraucht um die Servietten für ein Bankett herzurich- ten, hat zu uns Küchenmädchen heruntergeschickt, es gibt hier an fünfzig solcher Mädchen, ich war gerade bei der Hand und habe sie sehr zufriedengestellt, denn im Aufauen der Servietten habe ich mich immer ausge- kannt. Und so hat sie mich von da an in ihrer Nähe behalten und allmählich zu ihrer Sekretärin ausgebildet. Dabei habe ich sehr viel gelernt."" „Gibt es denn da so- viel zu schreiben?"" fragte Karl. „Ach sehr viel"", antwor- tete sie, „das können Sie sich wahrscheinlich gar nicht vorstellen. Sie haben doch gesehn, daß ich heute bis halb zwölf gearbeitet habe und heute ist kein besonderer Tag. Allerdings schreibe ich nicht immerfort, sondern habe auch viele Besorgungen in der Stadt zu machen."" „Wie heißt denn die Stadt?"" fragte Karl. „Das wissen Sie nicht?"" sagte sie, „Ramses."" „Ist es eine große Stadt?"" fragte Karl. „Sehr groß"", antwortete sie, „ich gehe nicht gern hin. Aber wollen Sie nicht wirklich schon schla- fen?"" „Nein, nein"", sagte Karl, „ich weiß ja noch gar nicht, warum Sie hereingekommen sind."" „Weil ich mit niemandem reden kann. Ich bin nicht wehleidig, aber wenn wirklich niemand für einen da ist, so ist man schon glücklich, schließlich von jemandem angehört zu wer- den. Ich habe Sie schon unten im Saal gesehn, ich kam gerade um die Frau Oberköchin zu holen, als sie Sie in die Speisekammern wegführte."" „Das ist ein schreckli- cher Saal"", sagte Karl. „Ich merke es schon gar nicht mehr"", antwortete sie. „Aber ich wollte nur sagen, daß ja die Frau Oberköchin so freundlich zu mir ist, wie es nur meine selige Mutter war. Aber es ist doch ein zu großer Unterschied in unserer Stellung, als daß ich frei mit ihr reden könnte. Unter den Küchenmädchen habe ich früher gute Freundinnen gehabt, aber die sind schon längst nicht mehr hier und die neuen Mädchen kenne ich kaum. Schließlich kommt es mir manchmal vor, daß mich meine jetzige Arbeit mehr anstrengt als die frühere, daß ich sie aber nicht einmal so gut verrichte, wie die und daß mich die Frau Oberköchin nur aus Mitleid in meiner Stellung hält. Schließlich muß man ja wirklich eine bessere Schulbildung gehabt haben, um Sekretärin zu werden. Es ist eine Sünde das zu sagen, aber of und of fürchte ich wahnsinnig zu werden. Um Gotteswil- len"", sagte sie plötzlich viel schneller und griff flüchtig nach Karls Schulter, da er die Hände unter der Decke hielt, „Sie dürfen aber der Frau Oberköchin kein Wort davon sagen, sonst bin ich wirklich verloren. Wenn ich ihr jetzt außer den Umständen die ich ihr durch meine Arbeit mache, auch noch Leid bereiten sollte, das wäre wirklich das Höchste."" „Es ist selbstverständlich, daß ich ihr nichts sagen werde"", antwortete Karl. „Dann ist es gut"", sagte sie, „und bleiben Sie hier. Ich wäre froh wenn Sie hierblieben und wir könnten, wenn es Ihnen recht ist, zusammenhalten. Gleich wie ich Sie zum er- stenmal gesehn habe, habe ich Vertrauen zu Ihnen ge- habt. Und trotzdem – denken Sie, so schlecht bin ich – habe ich auch Angst gehabt, die Frau Oberköchin könn- te Sie an meiner Stelle zum Sekretär machen und mich entlassen. Erst wie ich da lange allein gesessen bin, wäh- rend Sie unten im Bureau waren, habe ich mir die Sache so zurechtgelegt, daß es sogar sehr gut wäre, wenn Sie meine Arbeiten übernehmen würden, denn die würden Sie sicher besser verstehn. Wenn Sie die Besorgungen in der Stadt nicht machen wollten, könnte ich ja diese Ar- beit behalten. Sonst aber wäre ich in der Küche gewiß viel nützlicher, besonders da ich auch schon etwas stär- ker geworden bin."" „Die Sache ist schon geordnet"", sag- te Karl, „ich werde Lifjunge und Sie bleiben Sekretärin. Wenn Sie aber der Frau Oberköchin nur die geringste Andeutung von Ihren Plänen machen, verrate ich auch das Übrige, was Sie mir heute gesagt haben, so leid es mir tun würde."" Diese Tonart erregte Terese so sehr, daß sie sich beim Bett niederwarf und wimmernd das Gesicht ins Bettzeug drückte. „Ich verrate ja nichts"", sagte Karl, „aber Sie dürfen auch nichts sagen."" Nun konnte er nicht mehr ganz unter seiner Decke versteckt bleiben, streichelte ein wenig ihren Arm, fand nichts Rechtes, was er ihr sagen könne und dachte nur, daß hier ein bitteres Leben sei. Endlich beruhigte sie sich wenig- stens so weit, daß sie sich ihres Weinens schämte, sah Karl dankbar an, redete ihm zu, morgen lange zu schla- fen und versprach, wenn sie Zeit fände, gegen acht Uhr heraufzukommen und ihn zu wecken. „Sie wecken ja so geschickt"", sagte Karl. „Ja einiges kann ich"", sagte sie, fuhr mit der Hand zum Abschied sanf über seine Decke hin und lief in ihr Zimmer.","""Are you going to stay here long?"" she asked. ""It's not quite certain yet,"" answered Karl, ""but I think I'll stay."" ""That would be very good,"" she said, and passed her handkerchief over her face, ""I'm so alone here."" ""I'm surprised,"" said Karl, ""the head cook is very friendly to you. She doesn't treat you like an employee at all. I thought you were related."" Oh no,"" she said, ""my name is Terese Berchtold, I'm from Pomerania."" Karl also introduced himself the attribution has become a little stranger. They were silent for a while. Then she said: ""You mustn't think that I'm ungrateful. Without the head cook, things would be much worse for me. I used to be a kitchen maid here in the hotel and I'm fine In great danger of being laid off because I couldn't do the heavy work. They have very high demands here. A month ago a kitchen maid passed out just from exertion and was in the hospital for a fortnight. And I'm not very strong, I used to suffer a lot and as a result I'm a little behind in development, you wouldn't say I'm eighteen years old. But now I'm getting stronger."" ""The service here must really be very tiring,"" said Karl. ""Downstairs I saw a Lifjungen sleeping standing up."" ""The Lifjungen have it best,"" she said, ""they earn their nice money from tips and after all they don't have to work as hard as the people in the kitchen. But I was really lucky there, the head cook once needed a maid to prepare the napkins for a banquet, sent kitchen maids down to us, there are about fifty such maids here, I was just at hand and made them very happy, because I was in the making of the napkins I always knew my way around. And so from then on she kept me close to her and gradually trained me to be her secretary. I learned a lot in the process."" ""Is there so much to write about?"" Karl asked. ""Oh, a lot,"" she answered, ""you probably can't imagine that. You saw that I worked until half past eleven today and today is not a special day. Of course I don't write all the time, I have a lot of errands to do in the city."" ""What's the name of the city?"" asked Karl. ""You don't know that?"" she said, ""Ramses."" ""Is it a big city?"" asked Karl. ""Very big,"" she answered, ""I don't like going there. But don't you really want to go to sleep already?"" ""No, no,"" said Karl, ""I still don't know why you came in."" ""Because I can't talk to anyone. I'm not self-pitying, but if really If there is no one there for you, you are happy to finally be heard by someone. I saw you down in the hall, I was just coming to fetch the head cook when she led you away to the pantry."" ""It's a terrible hall,"" said Karl. ""I don't even notice it anymore,"" she answered. ""But I just wanted to say that the head cook is as kind to me as only my late mother was. But there is too great a difference in our position for me to be able to speak freely to her. I used to have good friends among the kitchen maids, but they are long gone and I hardly know the new girls. After all, it sometimes seems to me that my current job is more exhausting than the previous one, but that I don't even do it as well as they did, and that the head cook's wife only keeps me in my position out of pity. After all, you really have to have had a better school education to become a secretary. It is a sin to say so, but often I fear going insane. For God's sake,"" she said suddenly much faster and quickly grabbed Karl's shoulder because he was holding his hands under the blanket, ""but you mustn't say a word to the head cook, otherwise I'll really be lost. If I save her now the circumstances that I cause her through my work should also cause her suffering, that would really be the highest thing."" ""It goes without saying that I won't tell her anything,"" Karl answered. ""It's all right then,"" she said, ""and stay here. I'd be glad if you stayed here and we could stick together if that's okay with you. As soon as I saw you for the first time, I had confidence in you. And yet - you think, I'm so bad - I was also afraid that the head cook might make you secretary in my place and fire me. It wasn't until I sat there alone for a long time while you were down in the office that I thought things through in such a way that it would actually be very good if you would take over my work, because you would certainly understand it better. If you didn't want to run errands around town, I could keep this job. But otherwise I would certainly be much more useful in the kitchen, especially since I've gotten a little stronger."" ""The matter is already settled,"" said Karl, ""I'll be Lifjunge and you'll remain secretary. But if you give the head cook even the slightest hint of your plans, I'll tell you the rest of what you said to me today, sorry as I would be."" This tone excited Terese so much that she threw herself down by the bed and pressed his face into the bedclothes, whimpering. ""I'm not going to tell you anything,"" said Karl, ""but you're not allowed to say anything either."" could tell her and only thought that life was bitter here. Finally she calmed down at least enough to be ashamed of crying, looked at Karl gratefully, encouraged him to sleep late tomorrow and promised if she would find time to come up around eight o'clock and wake him up. ""You wake him up so skilfully,"" said Karl. ""Yes, I can do a few things,"" she said, running her hand gently over his blanket in farewell and walking into her room.","‘Are you going to be staying here for long?’ she asked. ‘I’m not sure yet,’ replied Karl, ‘ but I think I’d like to stay.’ ‘That would be a very good thing,’ she said, and passed her handkerchief over her face, ‘because I’m so lonely here.’ ‘You surprise me,’ said Karl, ‘ the Head Cook is very nice to you. She doesn’t treat you like an employee at all. I thought you might be a relation.’ ‘Oh no,’ she said, ‘my name is Therese Berchtold, I come from Pomerania.’ Karl introduced himself too. Thereupon for the first time, she looked him full in the face, as though by telling her his name he’d become a little stranger to her. For a while neither spoke. Then she said, ‘You’re not to think of me as ungrateful. But for the Head Cook, I’d be in a far worse position than I am. I used to be a kitchen maid here in the hotel, and I was in grave danger of being sacked, because I couldn’t do the heavy work. They ask an awful lot of you here. Last month a kitchen maid fainted through sheer over exertion, and spent two weeks in hospital. And I’m not very strong, I had a difficult childhood and I’m a bit underdeveloped as a result , you’d never guess I’m eighteen now would you. But I’m getting stronger now.’ ‘The work here must be very demanding,’ said Karl. ‘Just now I saw the lift-boy downstairs asleep on his feet.’ ‘But it’s the lift-boys who have the best of it ,’ she said, ‘they get a pretty penny from tips, and don’t need to slave away nearly as much as the people down in the kitchen. But I was really lucky, the Head Cook needed a girl once to fold the napkins for a banquet, and she sent down to the kitchen where there are about fifty of us girls, and I just happened to be available and she was very pleased with me because I’ve always been good at folding napkins. And from that time on she kept me at her side and gradually trained me to be her secretary. I’ve learned a great deal.’ ‘Is there such a lot of writing to do?’ asked Karl. ‘Oh, a great deal,’ she replied, ‘you probably can’t imagine it. You saw how I was working up until half past eleven, and today’s just an ordinary day. Admittedly I don’t spend all my time writing, I also have a lot of errands to run in the town.’ ‘What town is that?’ asked Karl. ‘Don’t you know?’ she said, ‘Ramses.’ ‘Is it a big town?’ asked Karl. ‘Very big,’ she replied, ‘I don’t like going there. But are you sure you don’t want to sleep now?’ ‘No, no,’ said Karl. ‘You haven’t told me why you came in yet.’ ‘It’s because I don’t have anyone to talk to. I don’t feel sorry for myself, but if you don’t have anyone, it makes you happy to find someone who will listen to you. I saw you when you were in the dining-room downstairs, I was just on my way to collect the Head Cook, when she led you off to the storerooms.’ ‘That dining-room is an awful place,’ said Karl. ‘I hardly notice it any more,’ she replied. ‘But I wanted to say that the Head Cook is as good to me as my dear departed mother. Only the difference between our ranks is too great for me to be able to talk to her freely. I used to have some good friends among the kitchen maids, but they’ve all moved on, and I don’t really know the new girls. Sometimes I think my new job is even more demanding than my old one, and I’m even less up to it, and that the Head Cook only keeps me in it because she feels sorry for me. You really need a better education than mine to be a secretary. It’s a sin to say so, but very often I’m afraid I may go mad. For God’s sake,’ she suddenly said much faster, and clutched Karl’s shoulder, as his hands were under the bedclothes, ‘you mustn’t breathe a word of this to the Head Cook, because otherwise I really would be done for. It would be unpardonable if, on top of the dissatisfaction she must feel with my work, I were to hurt her feelings as well.’ ‘You may rest assured that I won’t say anything to her,’ replied Karl. ‘Thank you,’ she said, ‘and I hope you do stay. I’d be pleased if you stayed, and if you like, we could be friends. The first time I saw you, I felt I could trust you. But at the same time – honestly, this is how bad I am – I was afraid that the Head Cook might make you her secretary in my stead, and get rid of me. Only when I was alone for a long time when you were downstairs in the office, I thought it over, and it seemed to me it would be just as well if you did take my job, because you’d be much better at it than I am. If you didn’t want to run errands in the city, I could go on doing those. Apart from that I’m sure I’d be far more useful in the kitchen, especially as I’m a bit stronger now.’ ‘The matter’s taken care of,’ said Karl, ‘I’m going to be a lift-boy, and you’ll go on being a secretary. But if you so much as hint of your plans to the cook, then I will go and tell her all that you’ve told me today, even though it would make me very upset.’ Therese was so shaken by his tone that she threw herself down on his bed, pressed her face against the sheets and sobbed. ‘I won’t give anything away,’ said Karl, ‘but you’re not to say anything either.’ Now he couldn’t remain completely hidden under the bedclothes any more, he stroked her arm a little, and could think of nothing comforting he could say to her, and only thought how bitter life here must be. Eventually she calmed down enough to be ashamed of her tears, and she looked gratefully at Karl, told him to sleep in tomorrow morning, and promised him, if she got a chance, to come up at around eight and wake him. ‘You’re famous for waking people up, I’ve heard,’ said Karl. ‘Yes, there are one or two things I’m good at,’ she said, ran her hand gently over the blanket in farewell, and scurried back to her room.","“Are you staying long?” she asked. “That still isn’t entirely certain,” Karl answered, “but I think I shall stay.” “That would be really great,” she said, wiping her face with her handkerchief. “I’m really very lonely here.” “I find that surprising,” said Karl, “after all, the head cook is very friendly toward you. She certainly doesn’t treat you like an employee. I was beginning to think you were related.” “Oh no,” she said. “My name is Therese Berchtold, I’m from Pomerania.” Karl introduced himself also. Whereupon she looked squarely at him for the first time, as if he had through the exchanging of names become a little more alien to her. For a moment they were silent. Then she said: “I don’t want you to think I’m ungrateful. If it weren’t for the head cook, I would be far worse off. I used to be a kitchen maid at the hotel and was in great danger of being dismissed, for I couldn’t keep up with the heavy work. They do demand a lot of us here. Last month a kitchen maid fainted from sheer overexertion and spent fourteen days in the hospital. And I’m not very strong, I had to endure a great deal of suffering early on and as a result developed more slowly; you probably couldn’t tell I’m already eighteen. But I’m getting stronger.” “The service here must really be very strenuous,” said Karl. “Downstairs I just saw a young lift boy asleep on his feet.” “But those lift boys actually have it best,” she said, “they earn great money in tips; besides, they don’t have to struggle nearly so much as those in the kitchen. But then I had a real stroke of luck; the head cook happened to need a girl to arrange the dinner napkins for a banquet and sent down for a kitchen maid—there are some fifty such girls —I happened to be at hand and was able to please her with my work, since I’ve always known how to arrange dinner napkins. And so from that moment on she kept me beside her and trained me little by little to become her secretary. I’ve learned a lot from doing that.” “Is there so much writing to be done?” asked Karl. “Oh, a great deal,” she answered, “you probably cannot even imagine how much. You saw that I worked until half past eleven today, and today is just an ordinary day. But I don’t spend all the time writing, I run many errands in the city too.” “Well, what’s the city called?” Karl asked. “You don’t know?” she said. “It’s Ramses.” “A big city?” Karl asked. “Very big,” she answered, “I don’t like going there. But you really don’t want to sleep?” “No, no,” said Karl, “I still don’t know why you came.” “Because there’s nobody I can talk to. I’m not whiny, but when one doesn’t really have anybody, one is naturally happy when someone finally listens. I saw you in the hall earlier on, I came to get the head cook just as she was taking you into the pantries.” “It’s a dreadful hall,” said Karl. “I don’t notice it anymore,” she answered. “I was about to say that the head cook has been as kind to me as my late mother. But the difference between our positions is too great for me to be able to talk openly with her. I used to have good friends among the kitchen maids, but they left a long time ago and I barely know the new girls. Besides, it sometimes seems to me that my present position is more exhausting than the previous one, though I don’t even do so good a job, and that the only reason the head cook keeps me on in this post is out of pity. After all, if you want to become a secretary, you do of course need to have had better schooling. Though it’s sinful to say so , often, often I fear I’m going mad. For God’s sake,” she said, suddenly speaking much faster and groping about to find Karl’s shoulders, for he had kept his hands under the blanket, “but you mustn’t mention any of this to the head cook, for otherwise I’m truly lost. It would be really dreadful if, besides the trouble I’m already giving her with my work, I should hurt her feelings too.” “Of course I won’t tell her anything about it,” replied Karl. “Very good,” she said, “and do stay. I should be happy if you stayed, and, if it’s all right with you, we could stick together. I’ve trusted you from the moment I first saw you. And yet—see, that’s how bad I am— I feared that the head cook could give the secretarial post to you and dismiss me. It was only after spending quite a while sitting here alone—while you were down in the office—that I realized how wonderful it would be if you took over my tasks, since you’d have a better understanding of them. If you didn’t want to do those errands in the city, I could hang on to that job. In any case I would certainly be much more useful in the kitchen, especially since I’ve become a little stronger.” “It’s already all set,” said Karl, “I’ll be a lift boy, and you’ll stay on as secretary. If you give the head cook even the slightest hint of your plans, I shall disclose everything else you’ve told me today, however much I’d regret having to do so.” Therese was so upset by Karl’s tone that she threw herself down by the bed and began to whimper, pressing her face against the bedclothes. “I certainly won’t disclose anything,” said Karl, “but you mustn’t say anything either.” Now he could no longer stay entirely hidden under the blanket; he stroked her arm a little and, finding it impossible to come up with anything appropriate to say, simply reflected that life here was bitter. At last she calmed down, at least enough to be ashamed of her weeping, looked gratefully at Karl, and after encouraging him to sleep late the following morning, promised that if she could find the time, she would come up shortly before eight o’clock and wake him. “You’re so good at waking people,” said Karl. “Yes, some things I can do,” she said, and letting her hand slide softly over his blanket in farewell, she ran into her room."
"Karl schwieg. Dieser Student, der doch so viel erfahre- ner war als er, der den Delamarche aus irgendwelchen Karl noch unbekannten Gründen haßte, der dagegen Karl gewiß nichts Schlechtes wünschte, fand für Karl kein Wort der Aufmunterung, den Delamarche zu ver- lassen. Und dabei kannte er noch gar nicht die Gefahr, die Karl von der Polizei drohte und vor der er nur bei Delamarche halbwegs geschützt war.","Karl said nothing. This student, who was so much more experienced than he was, who hated Delamarche for some reason Karl still didn't know, but who certainly didn't wish Karl anything bad, found no word of encouragement for Karl to leave Delamarche. And he didn't even know the danger that threatened Karl from the police and from which he was only halfway protected with Delamarche.","Karl didn’t say anything. That student, who was so much more experienced than himself, and who hated Delamarche for reasons Karl had yet to learn, and who certainly wished no ill upon Karl, didn’t offer so much as a word of encouragement to Karl to walk out on Delamarche. And he didn’t even know about the threat that was posed by the police, and from which Delamarche offered the only possible source of protection.","Karl remained silent. After all, this student, who was much more experienced than he and who, for reasons unknown to Karl, hated Delamarche and certainly bore Karl no ill will, could not come up with a single reason for encouraging Karl to leave Delamarche. And yet he knew nothing about the threat from the police that Karl faced and from which he was somewhat shielded only at Delamarche’s."
"„So ist es"", sagte der Kapitän erwartungsvoll.","""So it is,"" said the captain expectantly.","‘That’s correct,’ said the captain expectantly.","“Yes, that’s quite true,” said the captain expectantly."
"Nun begrüßten sie einander ordentlich und mit einer gewissen Förmlichkeit und Karl erfuhr, daß die zwei Maschinenschlosser waren, die in Newyork schon lange Zeit keine Arbeit hatten bekommen können und infolge- dessen ziemlich heruntergekommen waren. Robinson Öffnete zum Beweise dessen seinen Rock und man konn- te sehn, daß kein Hemd da war, was man allerdings auch schon an dem lose sitzenden Kragen hätte erkennen können, der hinten am Rock befestigt war. Sie hatten die Absicht in das zwei Tagereisen von Newyork entfernte Städtchen Butterford zu marschieren, wo angeblich Ar- beitsstellen frei waren. Sie hatten nichts dagegen, daß Karl mitkomme und versprachen ihm erstens zeitweilig seinen Koffer zu tragen und zweitens, falls sie selbst Arbeit bekommen sollten, ihm eine Lehrlingsstelle zu verschaffen, was wenn nur überhaupt Arbeit vorhanden sei, eine Leichtigkeit wäre. Karl hatte noch kaum zuge- stimmt als sie ihm schon freundschaflich den Rat gaben, das schöne Kleid auszuziehn, da es ihm bei jeder Bewer- bung um eine Stelle hinderlich sein werde. Gerade in diesem Hause sei eine gute Gelegenheit das Kleid los zu werden, denn die Zimmerfrau betreibe einen Kleider- handel. Sie halfen Karl, der auch rücksichtlich des Klei- des noch nicht ganz entschlossen war, aus dem Kleid heraus und trugen es davon. Als Karl, allein gelassen und noch ein wenig schlafrunken, sein altes Reisekleid lang- sam anzog, machte er sich Vorwürfe das Kleid verkauf zu haben, das ihm vielleicht bei der Bewerbung um eine Lehrlingsstelle schaden, um einen bessern Posten aber nur nützen konnte und er öffnete die Tür, um die zwei zurück zu rufen, stieß aber schon mit ihnen zusammen, die einen halben Dollar als Erlös auf den Tisch legten, dabei aber so fröhliche Gesichter machten, daß man sich unmöglich dazu überreden konnte, sie hätten bei dem Verkauf nicht auch ihren Verdienst gehabt undzwar ei- nen ärgerlich großen.","Now they greeted each other properly and with a certain formality, and Karl learned that the two were machinists who had not been able to get work in New York for a long time and were consequently rather shabby. Robinson opened his skirt to prove it and it could be seen that there was no shirt, which, however, could have been seen from the loose-fitting collar fastened at the back of the skirt. They intended to march to the town of Butterford, two days' journey from New York, where jobs were said to be vacant. They didn't mind Karl coming with them and promised firstly to carry his suitcase for a while and secondly, if they got work themselves, to get him an apprenticeship, which would be easy if there was any work at all. Karl had hardly agreed when they amicably advised him to take off the beautiful dress, since it would be a hindrance to him whenever he applied for a job. In this house in particular there is a good opportunity to get rid of the dress, because the chambermaid runs a clothing store. They helped Karl, who wasn't quite sure about the dress, out of the dress and carried it away. When Karl, left alone and still a little drowsy, slowly put on his old traveling dress, he blamed himself for having sold the dress, which might harm him when applying for an apprenticeship, but could only help him to get a better job opened the door to call the two back but bumped into them, who put half a dollar on the table for proceeds, but with such happy faces it was impossible to convince yourself they weren't in the sale also had its merit, and an annoyingly large one at that.","They now greeted each other properly and with a certain formality, and Karl learned that the two of them were fitters who had been out of work for a long time in New York, and so were pretty much on their uppers. By way of demonstration, Robinson opened his jacket and one could see he had no shirt on underneath, which one might also have concluded from the loose fit of his collar, which was attached to his jacket at the back. They were on their way to the little town of Butterford, two days’ walk from New York, where apparently there were jobs to be had. They had no objection to Karl joining them, and promised him firstly that they would carry his suitcase some of the time, and secondly, if they should get jobs themselves, to get him a place as a trainee, which, if there was any work going at all, would be a simple matter. No sooner had Karl agreed to this, than they were counselling him to take off his good suit, which would only be a disadvantage to him in looking for a job. In fact, there was a good opportunity to get rid of it here and now, because the cleaning woman ran a clothes stall. They helped Karl, who wasn’t altogether convinced in the matter of the suit, to get out of it, and they took it away. As Karl, alone now and still a little groggy with sleep, slowly got into his old suit, he reproached himself for selling the other which might disadvantage him in applying for a traineeship, but could only be of assistance in the search for a better sort of job, and he opened the door to call the two of them back, but there they were already, laying half a dollar as the proceeds of the sale on the table, but looking so pleased with themselves that it was impossible not to believe that they hadn’t also earned their share from the sale, and an irritatingly large one at that.","They now introduced themselves properly, even with a certain formality; Karl discovered that the two youths were locksmiths, who had been long unable to find work in New York and were consequently rather down-at-heels. To prove this was so, Robinson opened his coat, and one could see that he was not wearing a shirt, as was also indicated by the loose-fitting collar attached to the back of his coat. They intended to march to the town of Butterford, a two-day trek from New York, where there were said to be job openings. They had no objection to Karl’s accompanying them and promised him, first, that they would carry his trunk every now and then and, second, that if they found work, they would obtain an apprenticeship for him, something that would be easy to arrange if there were jobs available. Karl had no sooner agreed than they gave him the friendly advice that he should take off his beautiful suit, for it would be a hindrance in applying for jobs. Actually at this very inn there was a great opportunity for disposing of the suit, since the chambermaid dealt in used clothing. They helped Karl, who had not yet reached a final decision about the suit, remove it and took it away. Thus abandoned and still rather drowsy, Karl changed slowly into his old traveling clothes, chiding himself for having sold the other suit, which might hurt his chances in applying for a position as an apprentice but could only help with better jobs, and he opened the door to recall them, only to run into them right away; although they put a half dollar on the table by way of proceeds, their faces were so cheerful that one could scarcely persuade oneself that they had not made a profit and indeed an irritatingly large one."
"Karl stand auf, lehnte sich ans Geländer und sah auf die Straße hinunter. Der Mond war schon sichtbar, in die Tiefe der Gasse drang sein Licht aber noch nicht. Die am Tag so leere Gasse war besonders vor den Haustoren gedrängt voll Menschen, alle waren in langsamer schwerfälliger Bewegung, die Hemdärmel der Männer, die hellen Kleider der Frauen hoben sich schwach vom Dunkel ab, alle waren ohne Kopfedeckung. Die vielen Balkone ringsherum waren nun insgesamt besetzt, dort saßen beim Licht einer Glühlampe die Familien je nach der Größe des Balkons um einen kleinen Tisch herum oder bloß auf Sesseln in einer Reihe oder sie steckten wenigstens die Köpfe aus dem Zimmer hervor. Die Männer saßen breitbeinig da, die Füße zwischen den Geländerstangen hinausgestreckt und lasen Zeitungen, die fast bis auf den Boden reichten, oder spielten Karten, scheinbar stumm aber unter starken Schlägen auf die Tische, die Frauen hatten den Schooß voll Näharbeit und erübrigten nur hie und da einen kurzen Blick für ihre Umgebung oder für die Straße, eine blonde schwa- che Frau auf dem benachbarten Balkon gähnte immer- fort, verdrehte dabei die Augen und hob immer vor den Mund ein Wäschestück, das sie gerade flickte, selbst auf den kleinsten Baikonen verstanden es die Kinder einan- der zu jagen, was den Eltern sehr lästig fiel. Im Innern vieler Zimmer waren Grammophone aufgestellt und bliesen Gesang oder Orchestralmusik hervor, man küm- merte sich nicht besonders um diese Musik, nur hie und da gab der Familienvater einen Wink und irgendjemand eilte ins Zimmer hinein, um eine neue Platte einzulegen. An manchen Fenstern sah man vollständig bewegungs- lose Liebespaare, an einem Fenster Karl gegenüber stand ein solches Paar aufrecht, der junge Mann hatte seinen Arm um das Mädchen gelegt und drückte mit der Hand ihre Brust.","Karl got up, leaned against the railing and looked down at the street. The moon was already visible, but its light had not yet penetrated the depths of the alley. The street, so empty during the day, was crowded with people, especially in front of the house gates, everyone was moving slowly, clumsily, the shirt sleeves of the men and the light-colored clothes of the women stood out faintly against the darkness, everyone was bareheaded. The many balconies all around were now occupied. There, by the light of an incandescent lamp, the families sat around a small table, depending on the size of the balcony, or just in a row on armchairs, or they at least stuck their heads out of the room. The men sat with their legs apart, their feet stretched out between the railings, and read newspapers that almost reached to the floor, or played cards, apparently mute but with heavy beating on the tables, the women had their laps full of needlework and only spared now and then just a quick glance at her surroundings or at the street, a blond, weak woman on the neighboring balcony kept yawning, rolling her eyes and always raising a piece of laundry to her mouth that she was mending, even on the smallest balcony the children knew how to chase each other, which was very annoying for the parents. Inside many rooms gramophones were set up and singing or orchestral music blew out, no one particularly cared about this music, only here and there the father of the family gave a sign and someone hurried into the room to put on a new record. At some windows you could see completely motionless lovers, at a window opposite Karl such a couple stood upright, the young man had put his arm around the girl and was squeezing her breast with his hand.","Karl stood up, leaned against the railing and looked down on the street. The moon was now visible, but its light didn’t yet reach into the depths of the street. The street, so empty by day, was now crammed full of people, especially the entrances to the buildings, everyone was in slow cumbersome movement, the shirtsleeves of the men and the light dresses of the women stood out a little from the darkness, all were bareheaded. The many balconies round about were all occupied now, there by the light of an electric lamp sat families, either round a small table or on a row of chairs, whatever suited the size of their particular balcony, or at the very least, they stuck their heads out of windows. The men sat there, legs apart, feet pushed through the railings, reading newspapers that reached down almost to the floor, or they played cards, apparently wordlessly, but smacking the cards down powerfully on the table, the women had their laps full of mending, and only occasionally allowed themselves a quick glance at their surroundings or at the street below, a frail blonde woman on the next door balcony kept yawning, rolling her eyes as she did, and covering her mouth with a garment she was just patching, even on the smallest balconies children seemed able to chase one another, which was tremendously irritating to the parents. Gramophones had been put on inside many of the rooms, and pumped out vocal or orchestral music, people weren’t particularly bothered about the music, only from time to time the head of the family would gesture, and someone would run into the room to put on a new record. At some of the windows you could see completely motionless lovers, one such couple stood at a window facing Karl, the young man had his arm round the girl and was squeezing her breast with his hand.","Karl rose, leaned over the balcony, and gazed down at the street. The moon was already visible, but its beams had not yet pierced through to the depth of the street. The street, so empty during the day, was now packed, especially by the front gates, the mass of people moving slowly and cumbersomely; the shirtsleeves of the men, the bright dresses of the women stood out feebly in the dark; none of them wore a hat. All of the numerous balconies in the vicinity were now occupied: depending on the size of the balcony, the families either sat around a little table in the light cast by an electric lightbulb, or on chairs set up in a row, or at least stuck their heads out from the room. The men sat, legs wide apart and feet stretched out between the bars of the railing, reading newspapers that almost reached the floor, or playing cards without seeming to make any noise, though they slapped the tables with great force; the women had their laps full of knitting and only rarely spared a quick glance for the surroundings or the street; a weak blond woman on the neighboring balcony yawned continually, crossed her eyes as she did so, and kept raising to her mouth the piece of laundry that she was mending; even on the smallest balconies the children managed to chase one another about, much to their parents’ irritation. In numerous rooms people had set up gramo phones that blasted out songs or orchestral music; they scarcely heeded the music, aside from the occasional father of a family, who would give a signal, and then someone would hurry into the room to put on a record. At some of the windows one could see utterly motionless couples. One such pair stood upright at a window facing Karl; the young man had his arm around the girl and was squeezing her breast."
"Endlich legte der Oberkellner die Zeitung gähnend hin, vergewisserte sich durch einen Blick auf Karl daß dieser noch anwesend sei und drehte die Glocke des Tischtelephons an. Er rief mehrere Male Halloh, aber niemand meldete sich. „Es meldet sich niemand"", sagte er zum Oberportier. Dieser, der das Telephonieren wie es Karl schien, mit besonderem Interesse beobachtete, sagte: „Es ist ja schon dreiviertel sechs. Sie ist gewiß schon wach. Läuten Sie nur stärker."" In diesem Augen- blick kam, ohne weitere Aufforderung das telephonische Gegenzeichen. „Hier Oberkellner Isbary"", sagte der Oberkellner. „Guten Morgen Frau Oberköchin. Ich ha- be Sie doch nicht am Ende geweckt. Das tut mir sehr leid. Ja, ja, dreiviertel sechs ist schon. Aber das tut mir aufrichtig leid, daß ich Sie erschreckt habe. Sie sollten während des Schlafens das Telephon abstellen. Nein, nein tatsächlich, es gibt für mich keine Entschuldigung, besonders bei der Geringfügigkeit der Sache wegen de- ren ich Sie sprechen will. Aber natürlich habe ich Zeit, bitte sehr, ich bleibe beim Telephon wenn es Ihnen recht ist."" „Sie muß im Nachthemd zum Telephon gelaufen sein"", sagte der Oberkellner lächelnd zum Oberportier, der die ganze Zeit über mit gespanntem Gesichtsaus- druck zum Telephonkasten sich gebückt gehalten hatte. Ich habe sie wirklich geweckt, sie wird nämlich sonst von dem kleinen Mädel, das bei ihr auf der Schreibma- schine schreibt, geweckt und die muß es heute aus- nahmsweise versäumt haben. Es tut mir leid, daß ich sie aufgeschreckt habe, sie ist so wie so nervös."" „Warum spricht sie nicht weiter?"" „Sie ist nachschauen gegangen, was mit dem Mädel los ist"", antwortete der Oberkellner schon mit der Muschel am Ohr, denn es läutete wieder. „Sie wird sich schon finden"", redete er weiter ins Tele- phon hinein. „Sie dürfen sich nicht von allem so er- schrecken lassen, Sie brauchen wirklich eine gründliche Erholung. Ja also meine kleine Anfrage. Es ist da ein Lifjunge, namens"" – er drehte sich fragend nach Karl um, der, da er genau aufpaßte gleich mit seinem Namen aushelfen konnte – „also namens Karl Roßmann, wenn ich mich recht erinnere, so haben Sie sich für ihn ein wenig interessiert; leider hat er Ihre Freundlichkeit schlecht belohnt, er hat ohne Erlaubnis seinen Posten verlassen, hat mir dadurch schwere jetzt noch gar nicht übersehbare Unannehmlichkeiten verursacht und ich habe ihn daher soeben entlassen. Ich hoffe Sie nehmen die Sache nicht tragisch. Wie meinen Sie? Entlassen, ja entlassen. Aber ich sagte Ihnen doch, daß er seinen Po- sten verlassen hat. Nein da kann ich Ihnen wirklich nicht nachgeben liebe Frau Oberköchin. Es handelt sich um meine Autorität, da steht viel auf dem Spiel, so ein Junge verdirbt mir die ganze Bande. Gerade bei den Lifjungen muß man teuflisch aufpassen. Nein, nein, in diesem Falle kann ich Ihnen den Gefallen nicht tun, so sehr ich es mir immer angelegen sein lasse Ihnen gefällig zu sein. Und wenn ich ihn schon trotz allem hier ließe, zu keinem andern Zweck als um meine Galle in Tätigkeit zu erhal- ten, Ihretwegen, ja Ihretwegen Frau Oberköchin kann er nicht hierbleiben. Sie nehmen einen Anteil an ihm, den er durchaus nicht verdient und da ich nicht nur ihn kenne, sondern auch Sie, weiß ich, daß das zu den schwersten Enttäuschungen für Sie führen müßte, die ich Ihnen um jeden Preis ersparen will. Ich sage das ganz offen, trotzdem der verstockte Junge paar Schritte vor mir steht. Er wird entlassen, nein nein Frau Oberköchin, er wird vollständig entlassen, nein nein er wird zu keiner andern Arbeit versetzt, er ist vollständig unbrauchbar. Übrigens laufen ja auch sonst Beschwerden gegen ihn ein. Der Oberportier z. B. ja also was denn, Feodor, ja beklagt sich über die Unhöflichkeit und Frechheit dieses Jungen. Wie, das soll nicht genügen? Ja liebe Frau Ober- köchin Sie verläugnen wegen dieses Jungen Ihren Cha- rakter. Nein so dürfen Sie mir nicht zusetzen.""","Finally the head waiter put the newspaper down, yawned, looked at Karl to make sure that he was still there, and rang the bell on the desk phone. He shouted hello several times, but no one answered. ""Nobody's answering,"" he said to the head porter. The latter, who was observing Karl's telephoning with particular interest, said: ""It's already a quarter to five. She's probably already awake. Just ring louder."" At that moment, without further prompting, the telephone countersign came. ""This is head waiter Isbary,"" said the head waiter. ""Good morning, Mrs. Head Cook. I didn't wake you up in the end. I'm very sorry. Yes, yes, it's a quarter to five already. But I'm really sorry that I startled you. You should turn off the phone while you sleep. No, no actually, there is no excuse for me, especially in the minor matter I want to speak to you about. But of course I have time, please. I'll stay on the phone if that's okay with you."" ""She must have run to the phone in her nightgown,"" said the head waiter, smiling to the head porter, who had been bent over the telephone box the whole time with a strained expression on his face. I really woke her up, because otherwise the little girl, who is typing on her typewriter woke her up and she must have missed it for once today. I'm sorry I startled her, she's still so nervous."" ""Why doesn't she go on talking?"" ""She went to see what's the matter with the girl,"" answered the head waiter, already holding the earphone to his ear, because the bell rang again. ""She'll find her way,"" he continued into the phone. ""You mustn't let everything frighten you, you really need a thorough rest. Yes, that's my little request. There's a Lifjunge by name "" - he turned questioningly to Karl, who, since he was paying close attention, was able to help out with his name - ""named Karl Roßmann, if I remember correctly, you were a little interested in him; Unfortunately, he rewarded your kindness badly, he left his post without permission, causing me serious inconvenience that cannot yet be foreseen, and I have therefore just dismissed him. I hope you don't take this tragically. What do you mean? Fired, yes fired. But I told you he left his post. No, I really can't give in to you, dear Ms. Head Cook. It's my authority, there's a lot at stake, a boy like that ruins the whole gang for me. You have to be really careful with the Lifjungen. No, no, in this case I cannot oblige you, no matter how much I try to please you. And if I'm going to leave him here in spite of everything, for no other purpose than to keep my gallbladder going, he can't stay here for your sake, yes, for your sake, Madam Head Cook. You take an interest in him that he doesn't deserve at all, and since I not only know him but also you, I know that this would lead to the greatest disappointment for you, which I want to spare you at all costs. I say that quite frankly, even though the stubborn boy is standing a few steps in front of me. He will be dismissed, no no Frau Oberkochin, he will be completely dismissed, no no he will not be transferred to any other work, he is completely unusable. Incidentally, there are other complaints against him. The head porter z. B. yes, what then, Feodor, yes, complains about the rudeness and impertinence of this boy. What, isn't that enough? Yes, dear Ms. Head Cook, you are denying your character because of this boy. No, you mustn't bother me like that.""","Finally with a yawn the Head Waiter laid the newspaper aside, looked to see that Karl was still present, and wound up the telephone on the table. He said ‘Hallo’ into it a few times, but no one answered. ‘ No one’s answering ,’ he said to the Head Porter. He, who, it seemed to Karl, was following the telephoning with particular interest, said, ‘It’s already a quarter to six. She’s bound to be awake. Ring louder.’ At that moment, without further prompting, the reply signal came. ‘ Head Waiter Isbary speaking,’ said the Head Waiter. ‘Good morning, Head Cook. I haven’t woken you up, have I. I’m so sorry. Yes, yes, it’s a quarter to six already. Oh, I’m so sorry to give you a start. You ought to disconnect the telephone while you’re asleep. No, no, absolutely, it’s quite unpardonable, especially in view of the trifling matter I’m calling about. Yes, of course I have time, by all means, I’ll hold the line if that’s all right.’ ‘She must have run over to the telephone in her nightgown,’ said the Head Waiter with a smile to the Head Porter, who was crouching over the telephone box with an anxious expression on his face. ‘I really did wake her up, usually the little girl who does her typing wakes her, and she must have overslept today. It’s a shame I woke her , she’s nervous enough as it is.’ ‘Why isn’t she back yet?’ ‘She’s gone to see what’s the matter with the girl,’ replied the Head Waiter, with the earpiece pressed against his ear, as it was ringing again. ‘ She’ll turn up,’ he said into the mouthpiece. ‘ You mustn’t be so put out by everything, you need a good holiday. Now, what I wanted to discuss with you. There’s a lift-boy by the name of’ – he turned inquiringly to Karl, who, having been following closely, said his name – ‘by the name of Karl Rossmann, if I remember rightly, you took him under your wing a bit; I’m sorry to say he’s given you a poor reward for your kindness, he’s gone and left his post without permission, thereby causing me serious even incalculable consequences, and I have just fired him. I hope you won’t take it amiss. What’s that? Fired, yes, fired. But I told you, he left his post. No, I really can’t give in to you over this, my dear Head Cook. It’s a question of my authority, there’s a lot at stake, one rotten apple will spoil the whole barrelful. You need eyes in the back of your head, especially with those lift-boys. No, no, I’m afraid I can’t do you such a favour in this instance, anxious though I am always to be of service to you. And if I did let him stay in spite of everything, simply to keep my spleen functioning, it’s for your sake, yes yours, that he can’t stay. You look out for him in a way he certainly doesn’t deserve, and knowing both him and yourself as I do, I know that could only lead to your being gravely disappointed, which is something I want to spare you at any price. I say so quite openly, though the fellow’s buttoned his lip and is standing just a few feet away. He will be fired, no, no, Head Cook, dismissed, no no, he will be transferred to no other line of work, he is completely useless. Complaints are being voiced against him all the time. For example, the Head Porter, what’s that, Feodor, is incensed at the boy’s rudeness and impertinence. What, that’s not enough? My dear Head Cook, you’re denying your true nature on account of this boy. No please don’t give me such a hard time over this.’","At last the head waiter put down the newspaper with a yawn, assured himself through a glance that Karl was still present, and switched on the bell on the table telephone. He shouted hello several times, but there was no answer. “There’s no answer,” he said to the head porter. The latter, who was, Karl thought, following the telephone conversation with particular interest, said: “Well, it’s a quarter to six. She must be awake by now. Try to make it ring louder.” At that moment, without further prompting, an answering call came through. “Hello, this is Head Waiter Isbary,” said the head waiter. “Good morning, Madame Head Cook. But I hope I haven’t awakened you. I’m very sorry. Yes, yes, it’s already a quarter to six. All the same, I’m truly sorry I gave you a fright. You should turn off the telephone when you go to sleep. No, no, I don’t really have any excuse, especially given the trivial nature of the affair I wish to discuss with you. But of course I have time, please go on, and if you don’t mind, I shall remain on the line. She must have run to the telephone in her nightdress,” the head waiter smilingly informed the head porter, who throughout this exchange had been bent over the telephone apparatus with a tense expression on his face. “I did wake her. She’s usually awakened by the little girl who does her typewriting and who, quite exceptionally, must have neglected to do so today. I’m sorry I startled her; she’s already nervous enough.” “Why has she stopped talking?” “She’s gone to find out what happened to the girl,” replied the head waiter, who had already put the receiver to his ear, since the telephone was ringing again. “She’ll turn up all right,” he continued, speaking into the telephone. “You shouldn’t let everything scare you so. You really need a complete rest. Well, here’s my little question. There’s a lift boy, called”—he turned around and glanced inquiringly at Karl, who was paying close attention and could therefore help by giving his name—“well, called Karl Rossmann; if my memory serves me right, you took a certain interest in him; unfortunately, he did little to repay your kindness, left his post without permission, causing me great difficulties of still unknown dimensions, so I’ve just dismissed him. I hope you’re not taking this to heart. What do you mean? Dismissed, yes, dismissed. But I told you that he left his post. No, dear Madame Head Cook, I really cannot yield to you in this instance. It’s a question of my authority, there’s a great deal at stake here; it takes only one such boy for the entire gang to go bad. One has to be devilishly alert, especially with those lift boys. No, no, in this case I cannot do you a favor, although I always very much endeavor to defer to your wishes. And if despite all this I did leave him here, it would serve no other purpose than to keep my blood boiling; and indeed it is for your sake, yes, for your sake, Head Cook, that he cannot stay. He certainly doesn’t deserve the interest you take in him, and since I not only know him but you too, I realize that this would inevitably create the most grievous disappointments for you, and I wish to spare you those at all costs. I’m being very frank with you, even though the obstinate boy we’re talking about is standing only a few steps away. He’s dismissed, no, no, Head Cook, entirely dismissed. No, no, he’s not being transferred to some other work, he’s completely unusable. Besides, I keep on hearing additional complaints. For instance, the head porter, what was that again, Feodor; well, the head porter has been complaining about the boy’s cheekiness and impoliteness. Beg your pardon, you’re saying this won’t suffice? Listen, Madame Head Cook, you’re going against your own nature merely for the sake of this boy. And you mustn’t pester me like this.”"
"„Ja"", sagte der Student, „es geht nicht anders. Ich habe schon alles mögliche versucht, aber diese Lebens- weise ist noch die beste. Vorjahren war ich nur Student, bei Tag und Nacht wissen Sie, nur bin ich dabei fast verhungert, habe in einer schmutzigen alten Höhle ge- schlafen und wagte mich in meinem damaligen Anzug nicht in die Hörsäle. Aber das ist vorüber.""","""Yes,"" said the student, ""there's no other way. I've tried everything possible, but this way of life is still the best. Years ago I was only a student, day and night, you know, only I almost starved to death , slept in a dirty old cave and didn't dare go into the lecture halls in the suit I was wearing. But that's over.""","‘Yes,’ said the student, ‘it’s the only way. I’ve tried everything, but this way is still the best. Years ago I was only a student, day and night you know, and I almost starved doing it, I slept in a pigsty, and I didn’t dare enter the lecture halls in the suit I was wearing. But that’s over.’","“Yes,” said the student, “there’s no other way. I’ve explored many possibilities, but I’ve never found a better way of life. You see, some years ago I was exclusively a student, day and night, but I almost starved, had to sleep in a dirty old hole, and didn’t dare go into the classrooms wearing the suit I had back then. But that’s all over now.”"
"„Meine Herren!"" rief der Staatsrat, der von seinem Erholungsposten beim Fenster munter zurückkehrte, mit Bezug auf Karls Erklärung aus. Alle mit Ausnahme der Hafenbeamten brachen in Lachen aus, manche wie in Rührung, manche undurchdringlich.","""Gentlemen!"" exclaimed the Councilor of State, returning cheerfully from his resting post by the window, referring to Karl's explanation. All but the port officials burst out laughing, some as if touched, some impenetrably.","‘Gentlemen, I ask you,’ cried the state councillor, returning from his restorative visit to the window, with reference to Karl’s explanation. Everyone, with the exception of the port officials, burst out laughing, some as though moved, others more inscrutably.","“Gentlemen!” cried the state counselor, responding to Karl’s statement as he returned in good spirits from his refuge by the window. Everyone, aside from the harbor officials, burst out laughing, some as if moved, others rather inscrutably."
"Karl hielt sich mit Gewalt zurück, vorzuspringen. Aber da war auch schon der Kapitän da, welcher sagte: „Hören wir den Mann doch einmal an. Der Schubal wird mir so wie so mit der Zeit viel zu selbstständig, womit ich aber nichts zu Ihren Gunsten gesagt haben will."" Das letztere galt dem Heizer, es war nur natürlich, daß er sich nicht sofort für ihn einsetzen konnte, aber alles schien auf dem richtigen Weg. Der Heizer begann seine Erklärungen und überwand sich gleich am Anfang, indem er den Schubal mit Herr titulierte. Wie freute sich Karl am verlassenen Schreibtisch des Oberkassiers, wo er eine Briefwage immer wieder niederdrückte vor lauter Vergnügen. Herr Schubal ist ungerecht. Herr Schubal bevorzugt die Ausländer. Herr Schubal verwies den Heizer aus dem Maschinenraum und ließ ihn Klosete reinigen, was doch gewiß nicht des Heizers Sache war. Einmal wurde sogar die Tüchtigkeit des Herrn Schubal angezweifelt, die eher scheinbar, als wirklich vorhanden sein sollte. Bei dieser Stelle starrte Karl mit aller Kraf den Kapitän an, zutunlich als sei er sein Kollege, nur damit er sich durch die etwas ungeschickte Ausdrucks- weise des Heizers nicht zu seinen Ungunsten beeinflussen lasse. Immerhin erfuhr man aus den vielen Reden nichts eigentliches und wenn auch der Kapitän noch im- mer vor sich hinsah, in den Augen die Entschlossenheit den Heizer diesmal bis zu Ende anzuhören, so wurden doch die andern Herren ungeduldig und die Stimme des Heizers regierte bald nicht mehr unumschränkt in dem Raum, was manches befürchten ließ. Als erster setzte der Herr in Civil sein Bambusstöckchen in Tätigkeit und klopfe, wenn auch nur leise auf das Parkett. Die andern Herren sahen natürlich hie und da hin, die Herren von der Hafenbehörde, die offenbar pressiert waren, griffen wieder zu den Akten und begannen, wenn auch noch etwas geistesabwesend sie durchzusehn, der Schiffsoffi- cier rückte seinem Tische wieder näher und der Ober- kassier, der gewonnenes Spiel zu haben glaubte, seufzte aus Ironie tief auf. Von der allgemein eintretenden Zer- streuung schien nur der Diener bewahrt, der von den Leiden des unter die Großen gestellten armen Mannes einen Teil mitfühlte und Karl ernst zunickte, als wolle er damit etwas erklären.","Karl restrained himself from leaping forward. But the captain was already there, who said: ""Let's just listen to the man. As it is, Schubal is becoming far too independent for me over time, but I don't want to say anything in your favour."" The latter was meant for the stoker, it was only natural that he couldn't stand up for him immediately, but everything seemed to be ""On the right track. The stoker began his explanations and overcame himself right at the beginning by calling Schubal Mr. How happy Karl was at the head cashier's deserted desk, where he kept pushing down a letterbox for sheer pleasure. Herr Schubal is unfair ""Mr. Schubal prefers foreigners. Mr. Schubal ordered the stoker out of the engine room and had him clean the toilets, which was certainly not the stoker's business. Once even Mr. Schubal's ability was questioned, which was supposed to be more apparent than real. At this point, Karl stared at the captain with all his might, willingly as if he were his colleague, only to get his way through the somewhat awkward manner of speaking of the stoker should not be influenced to his detriment. After all, nothing real was learned from the many speeches, and even though the captain was still staring straight ahead, in his eyes determined to hear the stoker through to the end this time, the other gentlemen became impatient and the stoker’s voice soon lost control more unrestricted in the room, which gave rise to some fears. The gentleman in civilian clothes was the first to use his bamboo stick and knock, albeit softly, on the floor. The other gentlemen of course looked here and there, the gentlemen from the port authorities, who were obviously under pressure, picked up the files again and began to look through them, albeit somewhat absent-mindedly, the ship's officer moved closer to his table again and the chief cashier, who thought he had won the game, sighed deeply out of irony. Only the servant seemed to have been saved from the general distraction. He sympathized with the suffering of the poor man placed below the grown-ups and nodded gravely to Karl, as if he wanted to explain something by that.","Karl had to restrain himself forcibly. But there was the captain, saying: ‘Let’s just listen to the man, shall we. Schubal’s been getting a little too independent for my liking lately, which isn’t to say that I accept your case.’ This last remark was meant for the stoker, it was only natural that he couldn’t take his part at once, but things seemed to be going well. The stoker embarked on his explanations, and right at the outset he even managed to refer to Schubal as ‘Mr Schubal’. What joy Karl felt, standing by the chief cashier’s now deserted desk, repeatedly pushing down a little pair of scales, for sheer delight. Mr Schubal is unjust. Mr Schubal favours the foreigners. Mr Schubal dismissed the stoker from the engine-room and made him clean lavatories, which was surely not part of his job as a stoker. On one occasion, the diligence of Mr Schubal was alleged to be more apparent than real. At that point Karl fixed the captain as hard as he could, frankly, as if he were his colleague, lest he be influenced by the stoker’s somewhat clumsy way of expressing himself. Because, though he said much, nothing of substance was revealed, and while the captain went on looking straight ahead, showing in his expression his determination to hear the stoker out for once, the other men were becoming restless and the stoker’s voice was now no longer in sole command of the room, which did not bode well. First of all, the man in the civilian suit activated his cane, and began softly tapping it on the floor. Of course the other men couldn’t help looking in his direction now and again. The men from the port authority, obviously in a hurry, reached for their files and went back to looking through them, though in a slightly distrait manner, the ship’s officer moved back to his table; and the chief cashier, scenting victory, heaved a deep and ironic sigh. The only one unaffected by the general air of distraction that was setting in was the servant, who had some sympathy with the sufferings of the underdog at the hands of the powerful, and nodded earnestly at Karl as though to assure him of something.","Karl had to restrain himself from intervening. However, the captain had already approached them and said: “But let’s listen to what the man has to say. In any case I think Schubal has become much too independent of late, though this doesn’t necessarily speak in your favor.” Those last words were directed at the stoker; of course, it was only natural that the captain could not take his side right away, but otherwise everything seemed to be going well. The stoker launched into his explanations, and, overcoming his reluctance, began by addressing Schubal as “Mister.” This greatly pleased Karl, who stood by the chief bursar’s deserted desk, pressing the letter scales repeatedly in sheer delight: Mr. Schubal is unfair. Mr. Schubal gives preferential treatment to foreigners. Mr. Schubal banished the stoker from the engine room and made him clean toilets, which was certainly not his responsibility. At one point the stoker even questioned the competence of Mr. Schubal, which was, he claimed, more apparent than real. Whereupon Karl directed a most intent look at the captain, assuming an engagingly collegial expression merely so as to prevent such an awkward manner of speaking from disposing the captain unfavorably toward the stoker. There was indeed little enough to be gleaned from the latter’s many speeches, and although the captain continued to stare into space with eyes that showed his determination to hear out the stoker, the other gentlemen were becoming impatient, and ominously enough, the stoker’s voice no longer held sway in the room. The gentleman in civilian clothes was the first to move, stirring his little bamboo stick and tapping the parquet floor with it, if ever so lightly. Every now and then the other gentlemen glanced over; clearly in a hurry, the gentlemen from the harbor authority returned to their files and began to peruse them, if still rather absently; the ship’s officer returned to his position beside his table, and believing that he had carried the day, the chief bursar heaved a great ironic sigh. The only person who was evidently immune from this general distraction was the attendant, who could at least partially sympathize with the sorrows of a poor man who had suddenly been set down amid the mighty, and who nodded gravely at Karl, as though wishing to explain something."
"„Wie heißen Sie?"" fragte Karl nachdem er sich losge- lassen fühlte, zwar sehr höflich aber gänzlich ungerührt und strengte sich an, die Folgen abzusehn, welche dieses neue Ereignis für den Heizer haben könne. Vorläufig deutete nichts darauf hin, daß Schubal aus dieser Sache Nutzen ziehen könnte.","""What's your name?"" Karl asked after he felt let go, very politely but completely unmoved and made an effort to foresee the consequences that this new event could have for the stoker. For the time being there was nothing to indicate that Schubal was over could benefit from this cause.","‘What’s your name?’ asked Karl, once he felt he had been released, very politely but quite unmoved, and trying to see what consequences this new turn of events might have for the stoker. For the moment there was at least no suggestion that Schubal could draw any advantage from it.","Sensing that he had been released, Karl asked very politely yet also quite unmoved: “What’s your name?” At the same time he sought to predict the repercussions that this latest occurrence might have for the stoker. There was no sign just now that Schubal could profit from this affair."

"„Woher kennst Du den Mann?"" fragte Karl.","""How do you know the man?"" Karl asked.",‘How do you know the man?’ asked Karl.,“How do you know the man?” Karl asked.
"Ringsherum auf Sesseln und Fußbänkchen, auf und unter den Tischen, ja selbst auf der Erde in einen Winkel zusammengedrängt stand noch das ungewaschene Früh- stücksgeschirr der Mieter. Da waren Kännchen in denen sich noch ein wenig Kaffee oder Milch vorfinden würde, auf manchen Tellerchen gab es noch Überbleibsel von Butter, aus einer umgefallenen großen Blechbüchse war Cakes weit herausgerollt. Es war schon möglich aus dem allen ein Frühstück zusammenzustellen, an dem Brunel- da, wenn sie seinen Ursprung nicht erfuhr, nicht das geringste hätte aussetzen können. Als Karl das bedachte und ein Blick auf die Uhr ihm zeigte, daß sie nun schon eine halbe Stunde hier warteten und Brunelda vielleicht wütete und Delamarche gegen die Dienerschaf aufetz- te, rief gerade die Frau aus einem Husten heraus – wäh- rend dessen sie Karl anstarrte – : „Ihr könnt hier schon sitzen, aber das Frühstück bekommt ihr nicht. Dagegen bekommt ihr in zwei Stunden das Nachtmahl."" „Komm Robinson"", sagte Karl, „wir werden uns das Frühstück selbst zusammenstellen."" „Wie?"" rief die Frau mit geneigtem Kopf. „Seien Sie doch bitte vernünf- tig"", sagte Karl, „warum wollen Sie uns denn das Früh- stück nicht geben? Nun warten wir schon eine halbe Stunde, das ist lang genug. Man bezahlt Ihnen doch alles und gewiß zahlen wir bessere Preise als alle andern. Daß wir so spät frühstücken ist gewiß für Sie lästig, aber wir sind Ihre Mieter, haben die Gewohnheit spät zu früh- stücken und Sie müssen sich eben auch ein wenig für uns einrichten. Heute wird es Ihnen natürlich wegen der Krankheit Ihres Fräulein Tochter besonders schwer, aber dafür sind wir wieder bereit uns das Frühstück hier aus den Überbleibseln zusammenzustellen, wenn es nicht anders geht und Sie uns kein frisches Essen geben.""","All around, on armchairs and footstools, on and under the tables, even crowded together in a corner on the floor, were the tenants' unwashed breakfast dishes. There were little jugs in which there would still be a little coffee or milk, there were still remains of butter on some of the little plates, cakes had rolled far out of a large tin can that had fallen over. It was possible to put together a breakfast out of all this, which Brunelda, if she didn't find out its origin, could not have faulted in the slightest. When Karl considered this and a glance at the clock showed him that they had been waiting here for half an hour and that Brunelda was perhaps raging and unleashed Delamarche on the servants, the woman just cried out from a cough – while she was Karl stared – : ""You can sit here, but you won't get breakfast. On the other hand, you'll have supper in two hours."" ""Come on, Robinson,"" said Karl, ""we'll put breakfast together ourselves."" ""How?"" exclaimed the woman, head bowed. ""Please be reasonable,"" said Karl, ""why don't you want to give us breakfast? We've been waiting for half an hour, that's long enough. They'll pay you for everything and I'm sure we'll pay better prices than everyone else. The fact that we have breakfast so late is certainly annoying for you, but we are your tenants and have the habit of having breakfast late, and you also have to set things up a bit for us. Today, of course, you will because of your illness Miss daughter is particularly difficult, but we are again prepared to put together breakfast here from the leftovers if there is no other option and you do not give us fresh food.""","All around on chairs and footstools and on and underneath the tables, yes, even stacked in a corner of the floor, were the dirty breakfast dishes of the tenants. There were jugs which probably still contained a little coffee or milk, some of the little plates had scraps of butter on them, there was a large tin can that had fallen over, and some biscuits had rolled a long way across the floor. It was quite feasible to make all that into a breakfast that even Brunelda, as long as she was kept ignorant of its origins, wouldn’t have been able to turn her nose up at. When that occurred to Karl, and a glance at the clock told him that they had been waiting for half an hour already, and Brunelda might be raging and turning Delamarche against the servants, the woman was just calling out, in the midst of a fit of coughing – in the course of which she stared at Karl – ‘You can sit here as long as you like, you’re not getting any breakfast. But if you want, you can have supper in a couple of hours.’ ‘Come on, Robinson,’ said Karl, ‘we’ll put our own breakfast together.’ ‘What?’ cried the woman tilting her head. ‘Be reasonable,’ said Karl, ‘why won’t you give us our breakfast? We’ve been waiting for half an hour, that’s long enough. It’s all included in what we pay, and I’m sure we pay more than some of your other tenants. The fact that we breakfast so late may be burdensome for you, but we are your tenants, we’re in the habit of breakfasting late, so you should cater for us a little bit as well. Of course it’s particularly difficult for you today, what with your daughter’s sickness, but then again we’re prepared to make our own breakfast from the leftovers, if that ’s all there is and you won’t make us any fresh.’","The tenants’ unwashed breakfast dishes still lay strewn about on chairs and footstools, on top of and underneath the tables, and even, crammed into a corner, on the floor. There were small coffeepots still containing some coffee or milk and also bits of leftover butter on a number of the little plates; a large tin box had fallen down, and a few biscuits had spilled out. In fact, if one used all of this, one could put together a breakfast that even Brunelda could not fault, so long as she did not discover its origins. Just as Karl was considering this possibility and glancing at the clock, which made him realize that they had already spent half an hour waiting and that Brunelda had perhaps grown furious and was inciting Delamarche against the servants, the woman, who was still coughing, shouted—while staring at Karl: “You can sit there, but you’re not getting any breakfast. But in two hours you’ll be getting your supper.” “Come, Robinson,” said Karl, “we’ll put the breakfast together.” “What,” cried the woman, lowering her head. “Please be reasonable,” said Karl, “why don’t you want to give us our breakfast. We’ve been waiting for half an hour, which is certainly long enough. After all, you get reimbursed for all of this, and we certainly pay you better than everybody else. It’s surely a nuisance for you that we’re having breakfast at this late hour, but then we are your tenants and are accustomed to having a late breakfast, and you should also accommodate us a little too. Of course that will be especially difficult today owing to your daughter’s illness, but then again we’re prepared to put together a breakfast using those leftovers if there’s no other way and you aren’t prepared to give us any fresh food.”"
"Karl zeigte auf die Kinder, der Diener aber sagte ohne hinzusehn: „Kommen Sie rascher, es hat sehr lange ge- dauert, ehe Sie aufgenommen wurden. Man hatte wohl Zweifel?"" „Ich weiß nicht"", sagte Karl erstaunt, er glaubte es aber nicht. Immer, selbst bei den klarsten Verhältnissen fand sich doch irgendjemand der seinem Mitmenschen Sorgen machen wollte. Aber vor dem freundlichen Anblick der großen Zuschauertribüne, zu der sie jetzt kamen, vergaß Karl bald an die Bemerkung des Dieners. Auf dieser Tribüne war nämlich eine ganze lange Bank mit einem weißen Tuch gedeckt, alle Aufge- nommenen saßen mit dem Rücken zur Rennbahn auf der nächsttieferen Bank und wurden bewirtet. Alle wa- ren fröhlich und aufgeregt, gerade als sich Karl unbe- merkt als letzter auf die Bank setzte, standen viele mit erhobenen Gläsern auf und einer hielt einen Trink- spruch auf den Führer der zehnten Werbetruppe, den er den „Vater der Stellungsuchenden"" nannte. Jemand machte darauf aufmerksam, daß man ihn auch von hier aus sehen könne und tatsächlich war die Schiedsrichter- tribüne mit den zwei Herren in nicht allzugroßer Ent- fernung sichtbar. Nun schwenkten alle ihre Gläser in dieser Richtung, auch Karl faßte das vor ihm stehende Glas, aber so laut man auch rief und so sehr man sich bemerkbar zu machen suchte, auf der Schiedsrichtertri- büne deutete nichts darauf hin, daß man die Ovation bemerkte oder wenigstens bemerken wolle. Der Führer lehnte in der Ecke wie früher und der andere Herr stand neben ihm, die Hand am Kinn.","Karl pointed to the children, but the servant said without looking: ""Come quicker, it took a long time before you were admitted. ""I don't know,"" said Karl, amazed, but he didn't believe it. Always, even in the clearest of circumstances, there was someone who wanted to worry about his fellow man. But faced with the friendly sight of the large spectator stand, to which they now came, Karl soon forgot the servant's remark. A whole long bench on this grandstand was covered with a white cloth, all those admitted sat on the next lower bench with their backs to the racetrack and were served. Everyone was happy and excited, just as Karl was the last to sit down on the bench, many stood up with glasses raised and one made a toast to the leader of the tenth recruiting troop, whom he called the ""father of the job-seekers"". Someone pointed out that he could also be seen from here and indeed the referee's stand with the two gentlemen was visible not too far away. Now everyone swung their glasses in this direction, Karl too caught it in front of him standing glass, but no matter how loudly you shouted and no matter how hard you tried to draw attention to yourself, there was nothing in the umpire's stand to indicate that you noticed the ovation, or at least wanted to notice it.The leader leaned in the corner as before and the other Herr stood beside him, hand on his chin.","Karl pointed to the children, but the servant said without looking: ‘Hurry up, it took a very long time before you were taken. I expect they had their doubts?’ ‘I really don’t know,’ said Karl, astonished, but he didn’t think so. Always, even in circumstances that were clear as crystal, someone could be found who liked to alarm his fellow-humans. But at the wonderful sight of the large public enclosure to which they had now come, Karl quickly forgot the servant’s remark. On the stand was a long bench covered with a white cloth, and all those who had been accepted sat on the bench below it, with their backs to the racetrack, and were being catered for. All were excited and in high spirits, just as Karl sat down unnoticed, the last to arrive, on the bench, a number of them stood up with glasses aloft, and someone proposed a toast to the leader of the both publicity team, to whom he referred as ‘The father of all the unemployed everywhere’. Someone pointed out that he could be seen from there, and indeed there was the stewards’ tribune, with the two gentlemen, not too far away at all. Then everyone raised their glasses in that direction, and Karl too picked up the glass in front of him, but however loudly they called and however hard they tried to get their attention, nothing on the stewards’ stand indicated that they had noticed, or more precisely wanted to notice the ovation. The leader was leaning in the corner as before, and the other gentleman stood beside him, cupping his chin in his hand.","Karl pointed to the children, but the servant, who did not even glance at them, said: “Hurry up; it took them quite a while to decide to admit you. They must have had some doubts?” “I don’t know,” said Karl, taken aback; but he did not believe it was true. Even in the most clear-cut of situations, there is always someone who insists on causing grief for his fellow man. But at the pleasant sight of the large spectators’ stand that they had just reached, Karl soon forgot the servant’s remark. On this stand there was even a very long bench covered with a white cloth; all those who had been admitted sat on the next bench, with their backs to the racetrack, and were now being served a meal. Everyone was cheerful and excited, and just as Karl, the last to arrive, sat down on the bench without being noticed, a number of them stood up and raised their glasses, while one gave a little speech toasting the leader of the Tenth Recruiting Troupe, whom he called “the father of all jobseekers.” Somebody pointed out that one could actually see the leader from where they sat, and the judges’ stand with its two platforms was indeed not that far off. All now raised their glasses in that direction; Karl too took the glass in front of him, but however loudly they shouted and however much they tried to draw attention to themselves, there was no sign that anyone on the judges’ platform had noticed their round of applause or might soon do so. The leader was still leaning against the corner, and beside him stood the other gentleman, stroking his chin."
"Da ertönte aus dem Nebenzimmer lautes Händeklat- schen. „Es hört noch jemand zu!"" rief Karl aufgerüttelt. „Mack"", sagte Klara leise. Und schon hörte man Mack rufen: „Karl Roßmann, Karl Roßmann!""","Then there was a loud clapping of hands from the next room. ""Someone is still listening!"" cried Karl, shaken up. ""Mack,"" Klara said softly. And already Mack could be heard calling: ""Karl Roßmann, Karl Roßmann!""","Then there came the sound of loud clapping from the next door room. ‘Someone else is listening!’ cried Karl in consternation. ‘Mack,’ said Klara quietly. And Mack’s voice rang out, calling: ‘Karl Rossmann, Karl Rossmann!’","Just then loud clapping rang out from the adjacent room. “There’s someone listening!” cried Karl, startled. “Mack,” said Klara, softly. And one could already hear Mack calling: “Karl Rossmann, Karl Rossmann!”"
"Karl sah an einer Straßenecke ein Plakat mit folgender Aufschrif: „Auf dem Rennplatz in Clayton wird heute von sechs Uhr früh bis Mitternacht Personal für das Teater in Oklahama aufgenommen!

"Ein schmaler Balkon zog sich vor dem Zimmer seiner ganzen Länge nach hin. Was aber in der Heimatstadt Karls wohl der höchste Aussichtspunkt gewesen wäre, gestattete hier nicht viel mehr als den Überblick über eine Straße, die zwischen zwei Reihen förmlich ab- gehackter Häuser gerade und darum wie fliehend in die Ferne sich verlief, wo aus vielem Dunst die Formen einer Kathedrale ungeheuer sich erhoben. Und morgen wie abend und in den Träumen der Nacht vollzog sich auf dieser Straße ein immer drängender Verkehr, der von oben gesehn sich als eine aus immer neuen Anfängen ineinandergestreute Mischung von verzerrten menschli- chen Figuren und von Dächern der Fuhrwerke aller Art darstellte, von der aus sich noch eine neue vervielfältigte wildere Mischung von Lärm, Staub und Gerüchen er- hob, und alles dieses wurde erfaßt und durchdrungen von einem mächtigen Licht, das immer wieder von der Menge der Gegenstände zerstreut, fortgetragen und wie- der eifrig herbeigebracht wurde und das dem betörten Auge so körperlich erschien, als werde über dieser Stra- ße eine alles bedeckende Glasscheibe jeden Augenblick immer wieder mit aller Kraf zerschlagen.","A narrow balcony stretched its entire length in front of the room. What would have been the highest vantage point in Karl's home town, however, did not permit much more here than an overview of a street that ran straight between two rows of houses that seemed to be chopped off, and therefore fleeing into the distance, where from a lot of haze the Forms a cathedral tremendously exalted. And morning as well as evening and in the dreams of the night there was always a heavy flow of traffic on this road, which, seen from above, presented itself as a mixture of distorted human figures and the roofs of vehicles of all kinds scattered from ever new beginnings, from which out of itself arose a new, multiplied, wilder mixture of noise, dust, and smells, and all of this was grasped and penetrated by a mighty light, which was scattered again and again by the multitude of objects, carried away and eagerly brought again, and that seemed so physical to the infatuated eye, as if a pane of glass covering everything was about to be smashed with all its might at any moment.","A narrow balcony ran along the entire length of the room. But what would probably have been the highest vantage point in Karl’s hometown here did not afford much more than a view of a single street, which ran in a dead straight line between two rows of lopped-off houses until it vanished in the distance where the massive forms of a cathedral loomed out of the haze. In the morning and evening, and in his dreams at night, that street was always full of swarming traffic. Seen from above, it appeared to be a swirling kaleidoscope of distorted human figures and the roofs of vehicles of all kinds, from which a new and amplified and wilder mixture of noise, dust and smells arose, and all this was held and penetrated by a mighty light, that was forever being scattered, carried off and eagerly returned by the multitudes of objects, and that seemed so palpable to the confused eye that it was like a sheet of glass spread out over the street that was being continually and violently smashed.","A narrow balcony ran along the full length of his room. In his native city it would surely have been the highest lookout, yet here it offered little more than the view of a single street that ran in a straight line between two rows of veritably truncated buildings and therefore seemed to flee into the distance, where the outlines of a cathedral loomed monstrously out of a great haze. In the morning and in the evening and at night in his dreams, this street was filled with constantly bustling traffic, which seen from above seemed like a continually self-replenishing mixture of distorted human figures and of the roofs of all sorts of vehicles, constantly scattered by new arrivals, out of which there arose a new, stronger, wilder mixture of noise, dust, and smells, and, catching and penetrating it all, a powerful light that was continually dispersed, carried away, and avidly refracted by the mass of objects that made such a physical impression on one’s dazzled eye that it seemed as if a glass pane, hanging over the street and covering everything, were being smashed again and again with the utmost force."
"„Mach Dir keine Sorgen"", sagte Robinson und schüt- telte mit geschlossenen Augen den Kopf um alle mögli- chen Sorgen Karls abzuwehren, „der Posten hat auch Vorteile wie sie Dir kein anderer Posten bieten kann. Du bist immerfort in der Nähe einer Dame wie Brunelda ist, Du schläfst manchmal mit ihr im gleichen Zimmer, das bringt schon, wie Du Dir denken kannst, verschiedene Annehmlichkeiten mit sich. Du wirst reichlich bezahlt werden, Geld ist in Menge da, ich habe als Freund des Delamarche nichts bekommen, nur wenn ich ausgegan- gen bin, hat mir Brunelda immer etwas mitgegeben, aber Du wirst natürlich bezahlt werden, wie ein anderer Die- ner. Du bist ja auch nichts anderes. Das Wichtigste für Dich aber ist, daß ich Dir den Posten sehr erleichtern werde. Zunächst werde ich natürlich nichts machen, da- mit ich mich erhole, aber wie ich nur ein wenig erholt bin, kannst Du auf mich rechnen. Die eigentliche Bedie- nung Bruneldas behalte ich überhaupt für mich, also das Frisieren und Anziehn, soweit es nicht Delamarche be- sorgt. Du wirst Dich nur um das Aufräumen des Zim- mers, um Besorgungen und die schwereren häuslichen Arbeiten zu kümmern haben.""","""Don't worry,"" said Robinson, shaking his head with his eyes closed to ward off any worries Karl might have, ""the post also has advantages that no other post can offer you. You are always close to a lady how Brunelda is, you sometimes sleep with her in the same room, as you can imagine, that brings with it various conveniences, you will be paid handsomely, there is plenty of money, as a friend of Delamarche I didn't get anything, only when I went out, Brunelda always gave me something to take with me, but of course you'll be paid like any other servant, you're nothing else, but the most important thing for you is that I'll make your job a lot easier ""First of all, of course, I won't do anything to help me recover, but you can count on me when I'm only a little better. I keep the actual service of Brunelda to myself, i.e. doing my hair and dressing, unless Delamarche takes care of it. You will only have to worry about tidying up the room, running errands, and the heavier chores around the house.""","‘Don’t worry,’ said Robinson, and shook his head with serenely closed eyes, to dispel all possible worries of Karl ’s, ‘the job also brings advantages with it like no other. You’re in continual close proximity with a lady like Brunelda, sometimes you sleep in the same room as her, that, as you can imagine, has various amenities associated with it. You will be generously paid, money is there in copious amounts, as a friend of Delamarche ’s I wasn’t actually given any, except when I went out Brunelda gave me some, but of course you will be paid just like a regular servant. Because that’s all you’ll be. The most important thing for you, though, is that I will be able to make it a great deal easier for you. To begin with, of course, I won’t do anything so I can recuperate, but as soon as I feel a little better, you’ll be able to count on me. The actual attendance on Brunelda I’m going to keep as my preserve, which is to say dressing her and doing her hair, inasmuch as that isn’t done by Delamarche. You’ll only have to deal with the tidying of the room, the shopping and the heavy housework.’","“Don’t worry,” said Robinson, and, closing his eyes, he shook his head to fend off any possible worries Karl might have, “the post also has advantages that no other post could possibly offer. You’re always in the presence of a great lady, Brunelda, and sometimes even get to sleep in the same room, which, as you can imagine, can be quite agreeable. You’ll receive lavish pay, there’s plenty of money; as a friend of Delamarche’s I received nothing, aside from the money Brunelda chose to give me whenever I went out, but you’ll naturally get paid, like any other servant. And of course that is indeed what you are. But most important for you, I’ll make the post easy for you. Of course, at first I won’t do a thing so that I can recover, but then once I’ve recovered even just a little, you can rely on me. Now the task of caring for Brunelda—in other words, cutting her hair and dressing her—I’ll generally reserve for myself insofar as Delamarche hasn’t already seen to that. You’ll be responsible for tidying up the room, shopping, and the heavier domestic chores.”"
"Die Kameraden fand Karl schon in tiefem Schlaf, er war aber auch zu lange ausgeblieben. Gerade wollte er das Mitgebrachte appetitlich auf Papieren ausbreiten, die er im Korbe vorfand, um erst wenn alles fertig wäre, die Kameraden zu wecken, als er zu seinem Schrecken sei- nen Koffer, den er abgesperrt zurückgelassen hatte und dessen Schlüssel er in der Tasche trug, vollständig geöff- net sah, während der halbe Inhalt ringsherum im Gras verstreut war. „Steht auf!"" rief er. „Ihr schlaf und in- zwischen waren Diebe da."" „Fehlt denn etwas?"" fragte Delamarche. Robinson war noch nicht ganz wach und griff schon nach dem Bier. „Ich weiß nicht"", rief Karl, „aber der Koffer ist offen. Das ist doch eine Unvorsich- tigkeit sich schlafen zu legen und den Koffer hier frei stehen zu lassen."" Delamarche und Robinson lachten und der erstere sagte: „Sie dürfen eben nächstens nicht so lange fortbleiben. Das Hotel ist zehn Schritte entfernt und Sie brauchen zum Hin- und Herweg drei Stunden. Wir haben Hunger gehabt, haben gedacht, daß Sie in Ihrem Koffer etwas zum Essen haben könnten und ha- ben das Schloß solange gekitzelt, bis es sich aufgemacht hat. Im übrigen war ja gar nichts drin und Sie können alles wieder ruhig einpacken."" „So"", sagte Karl, starrte in den rasch sich leerenden Korb und horchte auf das eigentümliche Geräusch, das Robinson beim Trinken hervorbrachte, da ihm die Flüssigkeit zuerst weit in die Gurgel eindrang, dann aber mit einer Art Pfeifen wieder zurückschnellte, um erst dann in großem Erguß in die Tiefe zu rollen. „Haben Sie schon zu ende gegessen?"" fragte er, als sich die beiden einen Augenblick ver- schnaufen. „Haben Sie denn nicht schon im Hotel ge- gessen?"" fragte Delamarche, der glaubte, Karl beanspru- che seinen Anteil. „Wenn Sie noch essen wollen, dann beeilen Sie sich"", sagte Karl und gieng zu seinem Koffer. Der scheint Launen zu haben"", sagte Delamarche zu Robinson. „Ich habe keine Launen"", sagte Karl, „aber ist es vielleicht recht in meiner Abwesenheit meinen Koffer aufzubrechen und meine Sachen herauszuwerfen. Ich weiß man muß unter Kameraden manches dulden, und ich habe mich auch darauf vorbereitet, aber das ist zuviel. Ich werde im Hotel übernachten und gehe nicht nach Butterford. Essen Sie rasch auf, ich muß den Korb zurückgeben."" „Siehst Du Robinson, so spricht man"", sagte Delamarche, „das ist die feine Redeweise. Er ist eben ein Deutscher. Du hast mich früh vor ihm gewarnt, aber ich bin ein guter Narr gewesen und habe ihn doch mitgenommen. Wir haben ihm unser Vertrauen ge- schenkt, haben ihn einen ganzen Tag mit uns geschleppt, haben dadurch zumindest einen halben Tag verloren und jetzt – weil ihn dort im Hotel irgendjemand gelockt hat verabschiedet er sich, verabschiedet sich einfach. Aber weil er ein falscher Deutscher ist, tut er dies nicht offen, sondern sucht sich den Vorwand mit dem Koffer und weil er ein grober Deutscher ist, kann er nicht weggehn, ohne uns in unserer Ehre zu beleidigen und uns Diebe zu nennen, weil wir mit seinem Koffer einen kleinen Scherz gemacht haben."" Karl, der seine Sachen packte, sagte ohne sich umzuwenden: „Reden Sie nur so weiter und erleichtern Sie mir das Weggehn. Ich weiß ganz gut, was Kameradschaf ist. Ich habe in Europa auch Freun- de gehabt und keiner kann mir vorwerfen, daß ich mich falsch oder gemein gegen ihn benommen hätte. Wir sind jetzt natürlich außer Verbindung, aber wenn ich noch einmal nach Europa zurückkommen sollte, werden mich alle gut aufnehmen und mich sofort als ihren Freund anerkennen. Und Sie Delamarche und Sie Robinson, Sie hätte ich verraten sollen, da Sie doch, was ich niemals vertuschen werde, so freundlich waren, sich meiner an- zunehmen und mir eine Lehrlingsstelle in Butterford in Aussicht zu stellen. Aber es ist etwas anderes. Sie haben nichts und das erniedrigt Sie in meinen Augen nicht im geringsten, aber Sie mißgönnen mir meinen kleinen Be- sitz und suchen mich deshalb zu demütigen, das kann ich nicht aushalten. Und nun nachdem Sie meinen Kof- fer aufgebrochen haben, entschuldigen Sie sich mit kei- nem Wort, sondern beschimpfen mich noch und be- schimpfen weiter mein Volk – damit nehmen Sie mir aber auch jede Möglichkeit bei Ihnen zu bleiben. Übri- gens gilt das alles nicht eigentlich von Ihnen Robinson. Gegen Ihren Charakter habe ich nur einzuwenden, daß Sie von Delamarche zu sehr abhängig sind."" „Da sehn wir ja"", sagte Delamarche indem er zu Karl trat und ihm einen leichten Stoß gab, wie um ihn aufmerksam zu ma- chen, „da sehn wir ja wie Sie sich entpuppen. Den gan- zen Tag sind Sie hinter mir gegangen, haben sich an meinem Rock gehalten, haben mir jede Bewegung nach- gemacht und waren sonst still wie ein Mäuschen. Jetzt aber da Sie im Hotel irgendeinen Rückhalt spüren, fan- gen Sie große Reden zu halten an. Sie sind ein kleiner Schlaumeier und ich weiß noch gar nicht, ob wir das so ruhig hinnehmen werden. Ob wir nicht das Lehrgeld für das verlangen werden, was Sie uns während des Tages abgeschaut haben. Du Robinson, wir beneiden ihn – meint er – um seinen Besitz. Ein Tag Arbeit in Butter- ford – von Kalifornien gar nicht zu reden – und wir haben zehnmal mehr, als Sie uns gezeigt haben und als Sie in Ihrem Rockfutter noch versteckt haben mögen. Also nur immer Achtung aufs Maul!"" Karl hatte sich vom Koffer erhoben und sah nun auch den verschlafe- nen, aber vom Bier ein wenig belebten Robinson heran- kommen. „Wenn ich noch lange hierbliebe"", sagte er, könnte ich vielleicht noch weitere Überraschungen er- leben. Sie scheinen Lust zu haben, mich durchzuprü- geln."" „Alle Geduld hat ein Ende"", sagte Robinson. „Sie schweigen besser, Robinson"", sagte Karl, ohne Dela- marche aus den Augen zu lassen, „im Innern geben Sie mir ja doch recht, aber nach außen müssen Sie es mit Delamarche halten."" „Wollen Sie ihn vielleicht beste- chen?"" fragte Delamarche. „Fällt mir nicht ein"", sagte Karl. „Ich bin froh, daß ich fortgehe und ich will mit keinem von Ihnen mehr etwas zu tun haben. Nur eines will ich noch sagen, Sie haben mir den Vorwurf gemacht, daß ich Geld besitze und es vor Ihnen versteckt habe. Angenommen, daß es wahr ist, war es nicht sehr richtig Leuten gegenüber gehandelt, die ich erst paar Stunden kannte und bestätigen Sie nicht noch durch Ihr jetziges Benehmen die Richtigkeit einer derartigen Handlungs- weise?"" „Bleib ruhig"", sagte Delamarche zu Robinson, trotzdem sich dieser nicht rührte. Dann fragte er Karl: „Da Sie so unverschämt aufrichtig sind, so treiben Sie doch, da wir ja so gemütlich beisammen stehn, diese Aufrichtigkeit noch weiter und gestehn Sie ein, warum Sie eigentlich ins Hotel wollen."" Karl mußte einen Schritt über den Koffer hinweg machen, so nahe war Delamarche an ihn herangetreten. Aber Delamarche ließ sich dadurch nicht beirren, schob den Koffer beiseite, machte einen Schritt vorwärts, wobei er den Fuß auf ein weißes Vorhemd setzte, das im Gras liegen geblieben war und wiederholte seine Frage.","Karl found his comrades already sound asleep, but he had stayed away too long. He was just about to spread out what he had brought appetizingly on the papers he found in the basket, only to wake up his comrades when everything was ready, when, to his horror, he left his trunk locked behind and the key to it in his pocket fully open with half the contents strewn about in the grass. ""Get up!"" he cried. ""You sleep and meanwhile there were thieves."" ""Is something missing?"" asked Delamarche. Robinson wasn't quite awake yet and was already reaching for the beer. ""I don't know,"" exclaimed Karl, ""but the suitcase is open. It's imprudent to go to bed and leave your suitcase here."" Delamarche and Robinson laughed, and the first said: ""You mustn't stay away so long next time. The hotel is ten paces away and you need to go to the Three hours there and back. We were hungry, thought you might have something to eat in your suitcase and tickled the lock until it opened itself. Besides, there was nothing in it and you can pack everything up again."" ""So,"" said Karl, staring into the rapidly emptying basket and listening to the peculiar noise that Robinson made as he drank, as the liquid first penetrated deep into his throat, but then snapped back with a kind of whistle, and only then to roll down in great outpouring. ""Have you finished eating yet?"" he asked when the two of them catch their breath for a moment. ""Haven't you already eaten at the hotel?"" asked Delamarche, who thought Karl was claiming his share. ""If you still want to eat, hurry up,"" said Karl and went to his suitcase. He seems to be in a mood,"" said Delamarche to Robinson. ""I'm not in a mood,"" said Karl, ""but is it perhaps right in my absence to break open my suitcase and throw out my things. I know one has to put up with some things among comrades, and I've also prepared myself for it, but that's too much. I'll stay at the hotel and not go to Butterford. Eat up quickly, I have to give the basket back."" ""You see, Robinson, that's how they speak,"" said Delamarche, ""that's the fine way of speaking. He's just a German. You warned me about him early on, but I was a good fool and took him anyway. We put our trust in him, dragged him with us for a whole day, lost at least half a day as a result and now – because someone in the hotel lured him to him, he says goodbye, just says goodbye. But because he is a false German, he does not do this openly, but uses the suitcase as an excuse, and because he is a rude German, he cannot leave without insulting our honor and calling us thieves because we made a little joke with his suitcase."" Karl, who was packing his things, said without turning around: ""Just keep talking and make it easier for me to leave. I know quite well what comradeship is. I also have friends in Europe - de and no one can accuse me of having behaved wrongly or meanly towards him We are of course out of touch now, but if I should come back to Europe again everyone will give me a warm welcome and will immediately recognize me as their friend. And you Delamarche and you Robinson, I should have betrayed you when you were kind enough, which I will never conceal, to take me on and offer me the prospect of an apprenticeship at Butterford But it's something else. You have nothing, and in my eyes that doesn't demean you in the least, but you begrudge me my small possessions and are therefore trying to humiliate me, I can't stand it. And now that you've broken into my suitcase, don't apologize with a word, but continue to insult me and continue to insult my people - but in doing so you also deprive me of any opportunity to stay with you. By the way, none of that really applies to you, Robinson. My only objection to your character is that you are too dependent on Delamarche."" ""So we see,"" said Delamarche, stepping up to Karl and giving him a slight push as if to draw his attention, ""there let's see how you turn out. All day long you walked behind me, held onto my skirt, imitated my every movement and were otherwise as quiet as a mouse. But now that you feel some support in the hotel, start making big speeches. You're a little smartass and I don't even know if we're going to take it so calmly. Whether we won't ask for the lesson for what you copied from us during the day. You Robinson, we envy him – he says – his possessions. A day's work in Butterford - not to mention California - and we've got ten times more than you've shown us and than you may have hidden in the lining of your skirt. So keep your mouth shut!” Karl had gotten up from his suitcase and now saw Robinson approaching, who was sleepy but a little animated from the beer. “If I stayed here a long time,” he said, I might be able to do more Experience surprises. You seem interested in beating me up.' 'All patience wears out,' said Robinson. ""You'd better keep quiet, Robinson,"" said Karl, without taking his eyes off Delamarche, ""inwardly you agree with me, but outwardly you must stand with Delamarche."" ""Perhaps you want to bribe him?"" asked Delamarche. ""I can't think of one,"" said Karl. ""I'm glad I'm going and I don't want anything to do with either of you anymore. I just want to say one more thing, you accused me of having money and hiding it from you. Assuming it's true, wasn't it a very right thing to do to people I'd only known a few hours, and don't your present behavior confirm the rightness of such a course of action?"" ""Keep calm,"" said Delamarche to Robinson, although he didn't move. Then he asked Karl: ""Since you are so impudently candid, since we are standing together so comfortably, go further with this sincerity and admit why you actually want to go to the hotel."" Karl had to step over the suitcase Delamarche had stepped so close to him, but undeterred, Delamarche pushed the suitcase aside, took a step forward, stepping on a white shirt shirt that had been left lying on the grass, and repeated his question.","Karl found his companions already fast asleep, he really had been gone far too long. He was just about to lay the food out appetizingly on some paper napkins he found in the basket, and wake his companions when everything was ready, when he saw that his suitcase, which he had left behind locked, and the key to which he had in his pocket, was wide open, with half its contents scattered about on the grass. ‘Get up!’ he shouted. ‘Thieves have been here while you were asleep.’ ‘Is anything missing?’ asked Delamarche. Robinson, not fully awake, put out a hand for the beer. ‘I don’t know,’ said Karl, ‘but the suitcase is open. It was very reckless of you to go to sleep and leave the suitcase standing unprotected.’ Delamarche and Robinson both laughed, and the former said: ‘Well, you shouldn’t stay out so long. The hotel is no more than ten paces away, and it takes you three hours to get there and back. We were hungry and we thought there might be something to eat in your suitcase, so we tickled the lock till it opened. But there was nothing there, and you can pack it all up again.’ ‘I see,’ said Karl, staring at the rapidly emptying basket, and listening to the peculiar noise Robinson made while drinking as the liquid first rolled down his throat, then sped back upwards with a whistling sound, before finally gathering itself and plunging back into the deep. ‘ Have you finished eating?’ he asked, as the others paused for breath. ‘Didn’t you eat in the hotel?’ asked Delamarche, thinking Karl was claiming his share. ‘If you still want to eat, then hurry up,’ said Karl, and walked to his suitcase. ‘ He’s in rather a bad mood,’ Delamarche said to Robinson. ‘I’m not in a bad mood at all,’ said Karl, ‘ but I don’t think it’s right to break open my suitcase in my absence, and scatter my belongings on the ground. I know there’s always some give and take between companions, and I was prepared for it too, but this is going too far. I’m spending the night in the hotel and I’m not going on to Butterford with you. Now eat up, I have to return the basket.’ ‘Will you listen to that, Robinson, that’s the way to talk,’ said Delamarche, ‘that’s a fine way to talk. You can tell he’s German. You warned me off him early on, but like a fool I took him along. We put our trust in him, dragged him along with us for a whole day and lost at least half a day as a result, and now – just because someone’s lured him to the hotel – he says goodbye, he just simply says goodbye. But because he’s a perfidious German, he doesn’t do it openly, but he uses the suitcase as a pretext, and because he’s a vicious German, he can’t leave without offending our honour and calling us thieves, just because we had a little laugh with his suitcase.’ Karl, packing his things, said without turning round: ‘Just go on talking like that , you make it easier for me to leave. I know very well what companionship is. I had friends in Europe, and no one can say I behaved perfidiously or rudely to them. We’ve lost touch now of course, but if I ever return to Europe, they’ll be glad to see me, and we’ll be friends again right away. According to you, Delamarche and Robinson, I betrayed you when, as I will never cease to proclaim, you had the kindness to take me up and offer me the prospect of an apprenticeship at Butterford. But what really happened was something different. You have nothing, and while that doesn’t lower you in my estimation, it makes you envious of my few possessions, and so you try to humiliate me, and that’s what I can’t stand. Having broken open my suitcase, you offer not a word of apology, but rather go on insulting me and insulting my people – and that finally makes it quite impossible for me to remain in your company. All this doesn’t really apply to you, Robinson, my only objection to your character is that you are too much influenced by Delamarche.’ ‘So now we know,’ said Delamarche, walking right up to Karl and giving him a little push, as though to get his attention, ‘so now we know who you really are. All day long you’ve been walking behind me, you’ve held on to my coat-tails, you’ve followed my every move, and apart from that there wasn’t a squeak out of you. But once you think you’ve found some sort of support in the hotel, you start making big speeches to us. A slyboots is what you are, and I’m not sure we’re going to take it lying down. Perhaps we should demand a tuition fee for everything you’ve picked up from watching us. Say, Robinson, he says we’re jealous of his possessions. A single day in Butterford – not to mention California – and we’ll have ten times more than what you’ve shown us, and whatever else you’ve got sewn into the lining of your jacket. So watch your words with us!’ Karl had got up from his suitcase, and watched as Robinson, still sleepy but becoming animated by the beer, also approached him. ‘If I stay around here much longer,’ he said, ‘I might get some further surprises. You seem half inclined to beat me up.’ ‘Our patience has limits,’ said Robinson. ‘You’d better stay out of it, Robinson,’ said Karl, keeping his eyes on Delamarche, ‘I know you’re really on my side, but you have to pretend to support Delamarche.’ ‘Are you trying to bribe him?’ asked Delamarche. ‘I wouldn’t dream of it,’ said Karl. ‘I’m glad I’m going, and I want nothing more to do with either of you. I only want to say one more thing, you accused me of having money and hiding it from you. Assuming that was the case, wasn’t it the right way to behave with people I’d only known for a few hours, and hasn’t your present behaviour fully vindicated me?’ ‘Keep your cool,’ said Delamarche to Robinson, although the latter hadn’t budged. Then he asked Karl: ‘You’re being so shamelessly frank, why not, as we’re standing so companionably close together, take your frankness a stage further and admit to us what you’re going to the hotel for.’ Karl had to step back over his suitcase, so close had Delamarche come to him. But Delamarche wasn’t to be thrown off, he pushed the suitcase aside, took another stride forward, putting his foot on a white shirt-front that was lying on the grass, and repeated his question.","Karl found his companions already fast asleep; he had, however, stayed away too long. He was just about to spread out the items he had brought in an inviting fashion on some papers he had found in the basket , when to his consternation he saw that his trunk, which he had locked before leaving and the key to which was in his pocket, was open and half his belongings strewn on the grass. “Get up,” he cried. “You’re still sleeping though thieves have been here.” “Well, is there anything missing?” asked Delamarche. Al though Robinson was not yet fully awake, he was already reaching for his beer. “That I don’t know,” cried Karl, “but the trunk is open. Now that’s really careless of you, to go to sleep and leave the trunk lying about like that.” Delamarche and Robinson both laughed, and the former said: “So next time maybe you shouldn’t stay away so long. The hotel is only ten paces from here, yet it takes you three hours to get there and back. We were hungry, thought you might have something to eat in your trunk, and kept fiddling with the lock until it sprang open. In any case there was nothing inside, and you can calmly pack everything away again.” “Well,” said Karl, staring at the rapidly dwindling contents of the basket and listening to the odd sound Robinson produced as he drank, for the liquid first went far into his throat, shot back with a whistling sound, and only then in one great gush rolled down into the depths. “Had your fill,” he asked, as the two took a moment’s break. “But haven’t you eaten already at the hotel?” asked Delamarche, who believed that Karl was demanding his share. “Hurry up if you still want to eat,” said Karl, and walked over to his trunk. “Is he ever moody,” said Delamarche to Robinson. “I’m not moody,” said Karl, “but was it right to force open my trunk while I was away and to throw my belongings on the ground like that? I realize that there are some things one must simply tolerate among comrades, and I was prepared for that, but this is really going too far. I’ll spend the night at the hotel and will not go to Butterford. Now eat up quickly—I must return the basket.” “You see, Robinson, that’s how one should speak,” said Delamarche, “it’s such a refined way of speaking. Of course, he is, after all, a German. You warned me about him a while back, but I was quite a fool and took him along. We placed our trust in him, dragged him along for an entire day, and as a result we lost at least half a day, and now—simply because someone at the hotel enticed him over there—he takes off, simply takes off.” “But being a two-faced German, rather than doing so openly, he comes up with that excuse about the trunk, and being a coarse German too, he cannot leave without calling us thieves and insulting our honor, simply because we played a little prank on him with his trunk.” Without turning around, Karl, who was packing his belongings, said: “If you go on talking like that, you’ll simply make it easier for me to leave. I know what true companionship is. I had friends in Europe too, and none of them could reproach me for behaving in a false or nasty manner. We’re no longer in touch, naturally enough, but if I ever go back to Europe, they’ll receive me with open arms and recognize me right away as their friend. As for you, Delamarche, and you, Robinson, how could I possibly have betrayed you, since you were so kind as to take me on and hold out the prospect of an apprentice position in Butterford. But this is really about something else. You have nothing to your name, and though that doesn’t in the least diminish you in my eyes, you begrudge me my few belongings and for this reason try to humiliate me; I cannot stand it. And now after having broken open my trunk, you don’t offer me a word of apology, you even swear at me, then swear at my compatriots—which makes it impossible for me to stay with you. By the way, Robinson, this isn’t about you. The only criticism I have of your character is that you’re too dependent on Delamarche.” “Of course, we can now see,” said Delamarche, and approaching Karl, he gave him a little push, as if to make him pay attention, “of course, we can now see you showing your true colors. All day you ran around after me, held on to my coat, imitated my every movement, and for the rest were quiet as a little mouse. But now that you sense you have some backing at the hotel, you start holding forth in a big way. You’re just a little smart aleck, and I’m still not sure whether we’ll grin and bear this. Or whether we won’t demand fees for the knowledge you’ve gained from watching us all day. Listen, Robinson, can you hear what he’s saying , he’s saying we envy him his possessions. In one day’s work in Butterford—never mind California—we would earn ten times more than the sum you’ve shown us, in addition to whatever else you may have concealed in the lining of your coat. So watch your trap!” Having risen from the trunk, Karl caught sight of Robinson, who was still drowsy, though the beer had revived him a little. “If I were to stay much longer,” he said, “I might well experience further surprises. You seem to feel like beating me up.” “My patience is not unlimited,” said Robinson. “It would be better if you held your tongue, Robinson,” said Karl, without letting Delamarche out of his sight, “ deep down you think I’m right but you have to act as if you were siding with Delamarche.” “Could you be trying to bribe him?” asked Delamarche. “Not at all,” said Karl, “I’m happy to be going away and don’t want to have anything more to do with either of you. There’s just one other thing I want to tell you; you chided me for having money and for hiding it from you. Assuming that is true, wasn’t it the right way to deal with people whom I had known only for a couple of hours, and aren’t you yourself confirming through your present conduct that I acted wisely.” “Don’t move,” said Delamarche to Robinson, although the latter had not stirred. He then asked Karl: “Since you are so outrageously honest and since we’re having such a cozy time together, why don’t you be even more honest and own up to the real reason why you wanted to go to the hotel.” Karl had to step over the trunk since Delamarche was now so close. But refusing to be deterred, Delamarche pushed aside the trunk, advanced a pace, stepping on a white undershirt lying on the grass, and repeated his question."
"„Eine feine Sache, der schwarze Kaffee"", sagte der Student, „ schade, daß Sie so weit sind, daß ich Ihnen nicht ein wenig hinüberreichen kann.""","""It's a fine thing, the black coffee,"" said the student, ""a pity you're so far along that I can't hand you a little.""","‘Wonderful stuff, black coffee,’ said the student, ‘I’m sorry you’re so far away that I can’t give you some to try.’","“It’s such a great thing, black coffee,” said the student, “it’s a pity you’re so far away and I can’t hand you some.”"
"Das Essen zog sich besonders durch die Genauigkeit in die Länge, mit der Herr Green jeden Gang behandel- te, wenn er auch immer bereit war, jeden neuen Gang ohne Ermüdung zu empfangen, es bekam wirklich den Anschein, als wolle der sich von seiner alten Wirtschafe- rin gründlich erholen. Hin und wieder lobte er Fräulein Klaras Kunst in der Führung des Hauswesens, was ihr sichtlich schmeichelte, während Karl versucht war ihn abzuwehren, als greife er sie an. Aber Herr Green be- gnügte sich nicht einmal mit ihr, sondern bedauerte öf- ters, ohne vom Teller aufzusehn, die auffallende Appe- titlosigkeit Karls. Herr Pollunder nahm Karls Appetit in Schutz, trotzdem er als Gastgeber Karl auch zum Essen hätte aufmuntern sollen. Und tatsächlich fühlte sich Karl durch den Zwang, unter dem er während des ganzen Nachtmahls litt, so empfindlich, daß er gegen die eigene bessere Einsicht diese Äußerung Herrn Pollunders als Unfreundlichkeit auslegte. Und es entsprach nur diesem seinem Zustand, daß er einmal ganz unpassend rasch und viel aß und dann wieder für lange Zeit müde Gabel und Messer sinken ließ und der unbeweglichste der Ge- sellschaf war, mit dem der Diener, der die Speisen reichte, of nichts anzufangen wußte.","The meal was drawn out especially by the accuracy with which Mr. Green handled each course, while he was always ready to receive each new course without fatigue, it really did seem as if he were wanting to break away from his old one rest the landlady thoroughly. Now and then he praised Fraulein Klara's skill in running the household, which obviously flattered her, while Karl tried to fend him off as if he were attacking her. But Herr Green was not even satisfied with her, but often regretted Karl's striking lack of appetite without looking up from his plate. Herr Pollunder defended Karl's appetite, although as host he should have encouraged Karl to eat. And in fact Karl felt so sensitive because of the compulsion he suffered during the whole supper that, against his own better judgment, he interpreted Mr. Pollunder's statement as unfriendliness. And it was only in accordance with his condition that he once ate quite inappropriately quickly and much and then again for a long time tiredly let his fork and knife sink and was the most immobile of the company, with whom the servant who handed the food often had nothing to do knew how to start.","What made the dinner go on was the thoroughness with which Mr Green treated each course, although he always seemed ready for another one afterwards, never slackened, and really gave the appearance of wanting to recover from his old housekeeper. Now and again he would praise Miss Klara’s management of the house, which visibly flattered her, while Karl attempted to ward off these compliments as though they were attacks on her. Nor did Mr Green confine his attention to her , he repeatedly, without looking up from his plate, deplored Karl’s striking lack of appetite. Mr Pollunder defended Karl’s appetite, though, as Karl’s host, it should have been his role to encourage him to eat more. Karl felt under considerable strain throughout the meal, and that made him so sensitive that, against his better judgement, he saw Mr Pollunder’s words as hostile to himself. And it was purely on account of this that he suddenly consumed a great quantity of food with prodigious speed, then dropped his knife and fork exhausted and was the most lethargic member of the company, which made things very difficult for the waiter.","The meal dragged on, especially because of the meticulous way in which Mr. Green dealt with each course, even though he was always indefatigably prepared to take on each new course when it arrived, and it truly began to seem as if he merely wanted to take a good break from his old housekeeper. Every now and then he praised Miss Klara’s skill in running the household, but whereas she was visibly flattered, Karl wanted to fight him off, as though he were attacking her. But even that wasn’t sufficient for Mr. Green, who frequently, without looking up from his plate, deplored Karl’s conspicuous lack of appetite. Mr. Pollunder defended Karl’s appetite although, as host, he ought to have encouraged Karl to eat. The strain of sitting through that dinner had made Karl so sensitive that, even against his better judgment, he construed Mr. Pollunder’s words as unfriendly. And such was his state that he first ate at an inappropriately fast pace and then for a long time let his knife and fork drop wearily on his plate and was the most immobile of the guests and the one whom the attendant serving the dishes simply did not know how to handle."
"Die Oberköchin stockte in einem plötzlich sie über- kommenden Entschluß und sagte: „Karl, komm einmal her"" und als er zu ihr gekommen war – gleich vereinig- ten sich hinter seinem Rücken der Oberkellner und der Oberportier zu lebhafem Gespräch – umfaßte sie ihn mit der linken Hand, gieng mit ihm und der willenlos folgenden Terese in die Tiefe des Zimmers und dort mit beiden einigemal auf und ab, wobei sie sagte: „Es ist möglich, Karl, und darauf scheinst Du zu vertrauen, sonst würde ich Dich überhaupt nicht verstehn, daß eine Untersuchung Dir in einzelnen Kleinigkeiten recht ge- ben wird. Warum denn nicht? Du hast vielleicht tatsäch- lich den Oberportier gegrüßt. Ich glaube es sogar be- stimmt, ich weiß auch, was ich von dem Oberportier zu halten habe, Du siehst ich rede selbst jetzt noch offen zu Dir. Aber solche kleine Rechtfertigungen helfen Dir gar nichts. Der Oberkellner, dessen Menschenkenntnis ich im Laufe vieler Jahre zu schätzen gelernt habe und wel- cher der verläßlichste Mensch ist, den ich überhaupt kenne, hat Deine Schuld klar ausgesprochen und die scheint mir allerdings unwiderleglich. Vielleicht hast Du bloß unüberlegt gehandelt, vielleicht aber bist Du nicht der, für den ich Dich gehalten habe. Und doch"", damit unterbrach sie sich gewissermaßen selbst und sah nur flüchtig nach den beiden Herren zurück, „kann ich es mir noch nicht abgewöhnen, Dich für einen im Grunde anständigen Jungen zu halten.""","The head cook faltered in a decision that suddenly came over her and said: ""Karl, come here once"" and when he came to her - the head waiter and the head porter immediately joined behind his back for a lively conversation - she embraced him left hand, went with him and Terese, who was following helplessly, into the depths of the room and walked up and down there with both of them a few times, saying: ""It's possible, Karl, and you seem to have faith in that, otherwise I wouldn't want you at all understand that an investigation will prove you right in individual little things. Why not? Perhaps you actually greeted the head porter. I even think so, I know what I have to think of the head porter, You see I'm still speaking openly to you, but such small justifications don't help you at all.The head waiter, whose knowledge of human nature I've come to appreciate over the course of many years and who is the most reliable man sch, who I know at all, has clearly stated your guilt and it seems to me, however, irrefutable. Maybe you just acted imprudently, but maybe you're not who I thought you were. And yet,"" so to speak, she interrupted herself and only glanced back at the two gentlemen, ""I still can't get used to thinking you're a basically decent boy.""","Taken by a sudden impulse, the Head Cook stopped and said: ‘Karl, will you come here a minute,’ and when he had gone to her – straight away the Head Waiter and Head Porter conferred animatedly behind his back – she put her left arm round him, and followed quite helplessly by Therese, went with him to the other end of the room, and walked to and fro for a while with both of them, and said: ‘It is possible, Karl, and this is what you have put your trust in, otherwise I couldn’t understand you at all, that an investigation may show you to be right in one or two details. And why not? Perhaps you did greet the Head Porter. I even believe you did, I have my own opinion of the Head Porter , you see, I’m even now being quite open with you. But these vindications are no use to you really. The Head Waiter, whose judgement I have learned to respect in the course of many years, and who is the most reliable man I know anywhere, has clearly found you culpable, and that seems to me irrefutably the case. Perhaps you merely acted rashly, but then again, perhaps I was deceived in you. And yet,’ she said, virtually contradicting herself, and glancing across at the two men, ‘I can’t help thinking you’re still a good boy at heart.’","Overcome by a new resolve, the head cook faltered and said, “Karl, come here,” and when he approached her—the head waiter and the head porter gathered at once behind his back and struck up a lively conversation —she put her left hand around him and led him and the impassive, docile Therese far into the room, then back and forth a few times, before saying: “It is possible Karl—and indeed, you seem to be confident of this, for I simply could not understand you otherwise—that such an inquiry will corroborate that you are right, at least in certain details. Well, why not? Perhaps you actually did greet the head porter. I’m even quite sure of that; besides, I know quite well what I ought to think of the head porter; as you can see, I’m still very frank with you. But minor justifications of that sort won’t be of any help to you. Over the course of many years I’ve come to respect the head waiter as a good judge of character; of all the people I know, he is the most reliable, and he has after all stated clearly that you are guilty, which I too find incontrovertible. You may simply have acted rashly, or then again you may not be the person I initially assumed you were. And yet”—she stopped for a moment, looked back at the two gentlemen, and then went on—“yet I still cannot give up on the idea that you’re a fundamentally decent boy.”"
"Karl kramte aus seiner Geheimtasche, die er den Blik- ken dieser Leute zu zeigen keine Bedenken hatte, seinen Reisepaß hervor, den er statt weiterer Vorstellung geöff- net auf den Tisch legte. Der Oberkassier schien diesen Paß für nebensächlich zu halten, denn er schnippte ihn mit zwei Fingern beiseite, worauf Karl, als sei diese For- malität zur Zufriedenheit erledigt, den Paß wieder ein- steckte. „Ich erlaube mir zu sagen"", begann er dann, daß meiner Meinung nach dem Herrn Heizer Unrecht geschehen ist. Es ist hier ein gewisser Schubal, der ihm aufsitzt. Er selbst hat schon auf vielen Schiffen, die er Ihnen alle nennen kann, zur vollständigen Zufriedenheit gedient, ist fleißig, meint es mit seiner Arbeit gut und es ist wirklich nicht einzusehn, warum er gerade auf diesem Schiff, wo doch der Dienst nicht so übermäßig schwer ist, wie z. B. auf Handelsseglern, schlecht entsprechen sollte. Es kann daher nur Verläumdung sein, die ihn in seinem Vorwärtskommen hindert und ihn um die Aner- kennung bringt, die ihm sonst ganz bestimmt nicht feh- len würde. Ich habe nur das Allgemeine über diese Sache gesagt, seine besondern Beschwerden wird er Ihnen selbst vorbringen."" Karl hatte sich mit dieser Sache an alle Herren gewendet weil ja tatsächlich auch alle zuhör- ten und es viel wahrscheinlicher schien, daß sich unter allen zusammen ein Gerechter vorfand, als daß dieser Gerechte gerade der Oberkassier sein sollte. Aus Schlau- heit hatte außerdem Karl verschwiegen, daß er den Hei- zer erst so kurze Zeit kannte. Im übrigen hätte er noch viel besser gesprochen, wenn er nicht durch das rote Gesicht des Herrn mit dem Bambusstöckchen beirrt worden wäre, den er von seinem jetzigen Standort über- haupt zum erstenmal erblickte.","Karl dug out his passport from his secret pocket, which he had no hesitation in showing to these people. The chief cashier seemed to regard this passport as irrelevant, for he snapped it aside with two fingers, whereupon Karl, as if the formality had been satisfactorily completed, put the passport back in his pocket. ""I take the liberty of saying,"" he then began, that in my opinion Herr Heizer was wronged. A certain Schubal is taking it upon himself. He himself has served on many ships, all of which he can name for you served with complete satisfaction, is industrious, means well with his work and it is really hard to see why he should do poorly on this particular ship, where the service is not as extremely difficult as, for example, on merchant ships can therefore only be slander, which hinders his progress and deprives him of the recognition which he would certainly not want otherwise.I have only said the general thing about the matter, he will put his particular complaints to you himself ."" Karl had approached all the gentlemen with this matter because everyone was actually listening and it seemed much more likely that there was a righteous person among all of them than that this righteous person should be the chief cashier. Out of cunning, Karl had also concealed the fact that he had only known the stoker for such a short time. Besides, he would have spoken much better if he hadn't been put off by the red face of the gentleman with the bamboo stick, whom he was seeing for the first time from where he was now.","Karl reached into his secret pocket, which he had no fear of revealing to the eyes of these gentlemen, and pulled out his passport which he opened and laid out on the table, by way of an introduction. The chief cashier seemed unimpressed by the document, flicking it aside with two fingers, whereupon Karl, as though this formality had been satisfactorily concluded, pocketed his passport once more. ‘I should like to say’ he began, ‘that in my opinion the stoker here has been the victim of an injustice. There is a certain Schubal who oppresses him. He himself has served, to complete satisfaction, on many ships, which he is able to name to you. He is industrious, good at his work and it’s really hard to understand why, on this of all ships, where the work isn’t excessively onerous, the way it is for instance on clipper ships, he should let anyone down. There can only be some slander that is in the way of his advancement, and is robbing him of the recognition he should otherwise certainly not lack for. I have kept my remarks general, let him voice his particular complaints himself.’ Karl had addressed all the men in the office, because they were all listening, and the odds that one of their number should prove just were much better, than that the chief cashier should be the man. Cunningly, Karl had failed to say that he had only known the stoker for such a short time. He would have spoken far better if he hadn’t been confused by the red face of the man with the cane, whom he could see properly, really for the first time, from his new position.","Karl rummaged through his secret pocket, which he had no hesitation in showing to these people, took out his passport, and rather than saying a few words by way of introduction, simply laid it down open on the table. The chief bursar seemed to attach little significance to the passport, for he flicked it aside with two fingers, whereupon Karl put it away, as though the formality had been satisfactorily resolved. “If I may say so,” he began, “I believe that the stoker has been treated unjustly. There’s a certain Schubal on board, who’s been giving him trouble. He’s served in a most satisfactory manner on many ships—he can give you their names—is diligent, does his work in good faith, and so it’s rather difficult to understand how he could possibly be ill suited for a job on this particular ship, where the work is not so exceedingly difficult as, say, on merchant vessels. So those slanderous allegations are all that stands between him and the advancement and recognition that would otherwise be his due. I’ve addressed this matter only in the most general terms , he himself will inform you about his specific complaints.” Karl had directed his remarks at all of the gentlemen, since everybody was indeed listening, and it seemed much more likely that there should be a fair-minded person in their midst than that the fair-minded one should happen to be the chief bursar. Karl had, to be sure, neglected to mention that he had not known the stoker long. Also, he would have come up with an even better speech had he not been distracted by the red face of that gentleman with the little bamboo stick, and indeed it was only now from this new vantage point that he had first noticed him."
"Da ertönten aus der Ferne von der Gasse her stoßwei- se Trommeln und Trompeten. Einzelne Rufe vieler Leu- te sammelten sich bald zu einem allgemeinen Schreien. Karl drehte den Kopf und sah wie sich alle Balkone von neuem belebten. Langsam erhob er sich, er konnte sich nicht ganz aufrichten und mußte sich schwer gegen das Geländer drücken. Unten auf den Trottoiren marschier- ten junge Burschen mit großen Schritten, ausgestreckten Armen, die Mützen in der erhobenen Hand, die Gesich- ter zurückgewendet. Die Fahrbahn blieb noch frei. Ein- zelne schwenkten auf hohen Stangen Lampione, die von einem gelblichen Rauch umhüllt waren. Gerade traten die Trommler und Trompeter in breiten Reihen ans Licht und Karl staunte über ihre Menge, da hörte er hinter sich Stimmen, drehte sich um und sah den Dela- marche den schweren Vorhang heben und dann aus dem Zimmerdunkel Brunelda treten, im roten Kleid, mit ei- nem Spitzenüberwurf um die Schultern, einem dunklen Häubchen über dem wahrscheinlich unfrisierten und bloß aufgehäufen Haar dessen Enden hie und da her- vorsahen. In der Hand hielt sie einen kleinen ausge- spannten Fächer, bewegte ihn aber nicht sondern drück- te ihn eng an sich.","Suddenly drums and trumpets sounded in the distance in the street. Individual shouts from many people soon culminated in a general scream. Karl turned his head and saw how all the balconies came alive again. He got up slowly, he couldn't quite get up and had to press heavily against the railing. Below, on the sidewalks, young lads marched with long strides, arms outstretched, caps in hand, faces turned back. The lane was still clear. A few waved lanterns on high poles, which were enveloped in a yellowish smoke. The drummers and trumpeters were just stepping into the light in wide rows and Karl was amazed at the crowd when he heard voices behind him, turned around and saw Delamarche lift the heavy curtain and then Brunelda, in a red dress, came out of the dark room. with a lace drape around her shoulders, a dark bonnet over her hair, probably unstyled and merely piled up, the ends of which stuck out here and there. In her hand she held a small, stretched-out fan, but didn't move it, but pressed it tightly to her.","Then from the far end of the street there came bursts of trumpets and drums. A few isolated shouts from people gradually amalgamated into a general hubbub. Karl turned his head and saw life returning to the balconies. He slowly rose, he couldn’t quite stand upright yet, and had to lean hard against the railing. Down on the pavements were young fellows marching with great strides, arms out, caps in their raised hands, heads thrown far back. The actual road was still clear. Some individuals were swinging lanterns on long poles, which were swathed in yellowish smoke. Just then the drummers and trumpeters emerged into the light in broad ranks, and Karl was amazed at the numbers, then behind him he heard voices, and turned to see Delamarche raising the heavy curtain and Brunelda stepping out of the darkened room in her red dress, with a lace shawl over her shoulders, a dark bonnet over her probably unkempt hair that was merely piled up on her head, and tendrils of which peeped out here and there. In her hand she held a little open fan, but rather than using it, she kept it pressed against her face.","Then from afar, by way of the street, came the sounds of drums and trumpets as if in bursts. The scattered cries of numerous people soon merged into one general shout. Karl turned his head and saw that all of the balconies were becoming animated again. Slowly he rose, for he could not lift himself up completely and had to lean heavily against the balustrade. Upon the pavements below young fellows strode along, arms stretched out, caps in upraised hands, faces looking back. The thoroughfare was still empty. A few figures waved tall poles with lamps shrouded in a yellowish smoke. Just then deep rows of drummers and trumpeters stepped into the light, and Karl was astonished these were so numerous; then he heard voices behind him, turned around, and first saw Delamarche raise the heavy curtain, then Brunelda step out from the darkness of the room wearing her red dress, a lace wrap around her shoulders, and a small dark cap over her hair, which was probably not yet coiffed and had merely been gathered up with the ends peeking out here and there. In her hand she held a small open fan, but did not move it, pressing it against her body instead."
"„Nun solange es nicht geläutet hat dürfen wir nicht hineingehn"", sagte Robinson, der mit möglichst weit ge- öffnetem Mund das fette Brot verspeiste, während er mit einer Hand das vom Brot herabtropfende Öl auffieng, um von Zeit zu Zeit das noch übrige Brot in diese als Reservoir dienende hohle Hand zu tauchen. „Es ist hier alles strenger geworden. Zuerst war da nur ein dünner Vorhang, man hat zwar nicht durchgesehn, aber am Abend hat man doch die Schatten erkannt. Das war der Brunelda unangenehm und da habe ich einen ihrer Teatermäntel zu einem Vorhang umarbeiten und statt des alten Vorhanges hier aufängen müssen. Jetzt sieht man gar nichts mehr. Dann habe ich früher immer fragen dürfen, ob ich schon hineingehn darf und man hat mir je nach den Umständen geantwortet ‚ja' oder ‚nein', aber dann habe ich das wahrscheinlich zu sehr ausgenützt und zu of gefragt, Brunelda konnte das nicht ertragen – sie ist trotz ihrer Dicke sehr schwach veranlagt, Kopf- schmerzen hat sie of und Gicht in den Beinen fast im- mer – und so wurde bestimmt, daß ich nicht mehr fragen darf, sondern daß, wenn ich hineingehn kann, auf die Tischglocke gedrückt wird. Das gibt ein solches Läuten, daß es mich selbst aus dem Schlaf weckt – ich habe einmal eine Katze zu meiner Unterhaltung hier gehabt, die ist vor Schrecken über dieses Läuten weggelaufen und nicht mehr zurückgekommen. Also geläutet hat es heute noch nicht – wenn es nämlich läutet dann darf ich nicht nur, sondern muß hineingehn – und wenn es ein- mal so lange nicht läutet, dann kann es noch sehr lange dauern.""","""Well, we can't go in until the bell has rung,"" said Robinson, eating the fat bread with his mouth wide open, catching the oil dripping from the bread with one hand so that he could eat the remaining bread from time to time to dip into this cupped hand that serves as a reservoir. ""Everything has become stricter here. At first there was only a thin curtain, you didn't see through it, but in the evening you recognized the shadows. That was uncomfortable for Brunelda and there I had ""I had to convert one of their theater coats into a curtain and hang it here instead of the old curtain. Now you can't see anything anymore. Then I used to be able to ask if I could go in and depending on the circumstances I was answered 'yes' or 'No', but then I probably took advantage of it too much and asked too often, Brunelda couldn't bear it – despite her fatness, she is very weak, she often has headaches and gout in her Legs almost always - and so it was decided that I was no longer allowed to ask, but that if I could go in, the table bell would be pressed. It gives such a ring that it even wakes me from sleep - I once had a cat here for my entertainment and it ran away in terror at the ring and never came back. So it hasn't rung today - if it does, then I'm not only allowed to go in, I have to go in - and if it doesn't ring for so long, it can still be a very long time.""","‘As long as they haven’t rung, we aren’t allowed in,’ said Robinson, keeping his mouth as wide open as he could while eating the oily bread, and catching the oil that dripped from the bread in his other hand, and using it as a reservoir, dunked the rest of the bread in it from time to time. ‘Everything’s been tightened up here. At first there was just a thin curtain, you couldn’t quite see through it, but you could at least make out the shadows in the evening. That was disagreeable to Brunelda, and I had to alter one of her old theatre coats into a curtain and hang it up here in place of the old curtain. Now you can’t see anything at all. Then I used to be allowed to ask if I might go back inside yet and they replied “yes” or “no” according to the circumstances, but I expect I took advantage of that and asked once too often. Brunelda couldn’t stand that, in spite of her fatness she has a frail constitution, she often suffers headaches and has gout in her legs the whole time – and so it was decided that I can’t ask any more, but when I can go in, they’ll ring the bell on the table. That has such a loud ring that it even wakes me out of my sleep – I used to keep a cat here for company, and the ringing gave her such a scare that she ran off and never came back. So it hasn’t rung yet today – because if it rings it doesn’t just mean I’m allowed to go in, I have to go in – and if it hasn’t rung for a long time, then it could be a long time yet before it does.’","“We’re not allowed in until the bell rings,” said Robinson, and he devoured the greasy bread with his mouth, which he had opened as wide as possible, using one hand to catch the oil dripping from the bread so that now and then he could dip the rest of the bread into the palm of his hand, which served as a reservoir. “Everything has become stricter. At first there was only a thin curtain, you couldn’t see through it, but at night you could make out their silhouettes. Brunelda found that unpleasant, and I had to make a curtain out of one of her theatrical gowns and hang it up here instead of the old curtain. And now it’s impossible to see anything at all. I used to be allowed to ask whether I could go in, and depending on what was happening, they would answer yes or no, but I probably abused this by asking too often. Brunelda couldn’t stand that, for in spite of her girth, she has a weak constitution; she has headaches often and gout in her legs almost always— so they decided I would no longer be allowed to ask but could go in whenever they pressed the bell on the table. It rings so loud that it rouses even me from my sleep—I used to have a cat here to amuse myself a bit, but it ran off, frightened by that ringing, and never came back. Well, that bell still hasn’t rung today—and if it does it’ll mean I may, or rather must, go in—and if it doesn’t ring for such a long time, it can take a lot longer.”"
"Trotzdem war Karl gefaßter als früher. Schon daß sei- ne Sache für den Oberkellner so wenig Wichtigkeit zu haben schien, konnte man für ein gutes Zeichen halten. Es war schließlich auch nur begreiflich. Natürlich be- deutet ein Lifjunge gar nichts und darf sich deshalb nichts erlauben, aber eben deshalb weil er nichts bedeu- tet, kann er auch nichts Außerordentliches anstellen. Schließlich war der Oberkellner in seiner Jugend selbst Lifjunge gewesen – was noch der Stolz dieser Genera- tion von Lifjungen war – er war es gewesen, der die Lifjungen zum ersten mal organisiert hatte und gewiß hat er auch einmal ohne Erlaubnis seinen Posten verlas- sen, wenn ihn auch jetzt allerdings niemand zwingen konnte, sich daran zu erinnern und wenn man auch nicht außer Acht lassen durfe, daß er gerade als gewesener Lifjunge darin seine Pflicht sah, diesen Stand durch zeitweilig unnachsichtliche Strenge in Ordnung zu hal- ten. Nun setzte aber Karl außerdem seine Hoffnung auf das Vorrücken der Zeit. Nach der Bureauuhr war schon viertel sechs vorüber, jeden Augenblick konnte Renell zurückkehren, vielleicht war er sogar schon da, denn es mußte ihm doch aufgefallen sein, daß Robinson nicht zurückgekommen war, übrigens konnten sich Dela- marche und Renell gar nicht weit vom Hotel occidental aufgehalten haben, wie Karl jetzt einfiel, denn sonst hät- te doch Robinson in seinem elenden Zustand den Weg hierher nicht gefunden. Wenn nun Renell Robinson in seinem Bett antraf, was doch geschehen mußte, dann war alles gut. Denn praktisch wie Renell war, besonders wenn es sich um seine Interessen handelte, würde er schon Robinson irgendwie gleich aus dem Hotel entfer- nen, was ja umso leichter geschehen konnte, da Robin- son sich inzwischen ein wenig gestärkt hatte und über- dies wahrscheinlich Delamarehe vor dem Hotel wartete, um ihn in Empfang zu nehmen. Wenn aber Robinson einmal entfernt war, dann konnte Karl dem Oberkellner viel ruhiger entgegentreten und für diesmal vielleicht noch mit einer wenn auch schweren Rüge davonkom- men. Dann würde er sich mit Terese beraten, ob er der Oberköchin die Wahrheit sagen dürfe – er sah für seinen Teil kein Hindernis – und wenn das möglich war, würde die Sache ohne besonderen Schaden aus der Welt ge- schaf sein.","Nevertheless, Karl was more composed than before. The fact that his case seemed to have so little importance for the head waiter could be taken as a good sign. After all, it was only understandable. Of course, a lifjunge means nothing and therefore cannot afford to do anything, but precisely because he means nothing, he cannot do anything extraordinary either. After all, the head waiter had been a Lifjunge himself in his youth - which was still the pride of this generation of Lifjungen - it was he who had organized the Lifjungen for the first time and he certainly once left his post without permission, even though no one could force him to remember it now, and even if one shouldn't forget that as a former Lifjunge he saw it as his duty to keep things in order through at times unrelenting severity Karl also his hope that time would advance. According to the office clock it was already past five-fifteen, Renell could be back at any moment, maybe he was already there because he must have noticed that Robinson hadn't come back, by the way, Delamarche and Renell couldn't be far from the Hotel occidental stopped, as Karl now remembered, because otherwise Robinson would not have found his way here in his miserable state. If Renell found Robinson in his bed, which was bound to happen, then all was well. Because practically, as Renell was, especially when it came to his interests, he would somehow remove Robinson from the hotel right away, which could happen all the more easily since Robinson had in the meantime strengthened himself a little, and moreover probably Delamarehe was waiting outside the hotel to receive him. But once Robinson was gone, Karl could face the head waiter much more calmly and this time perhaps get away with a reprimand, albeit a serious one. Then he would consult with Terese whether he could tell the head cook the truth – he saw no obstacle for his part – and if that was possible, the matter would be settled without any particular harm.","Even so, Karl felt calmer than before. Even the fact that his affair seemed to have so little importance for the Head Waiter might be a good sign. One could see why it should be so. Of course a lift-boy is utterly insignificant and therefore may not step out of line, but by virtue of his insignificance what could he do anyway. And then the Head Waiter was a former lift-boy himself – which made him the pride of the present generation of lift-boys – he was the one who had organized the lift-boys for the first time, and he must certainly have left his post without permission on the odd occasion, even if no one could compel him to remember it now, and one shouldn’t forget either that, as an erstwhile lift-boy, he saw that his duty lay specifically in keeping that rank in order, even by occasionally draconian means. Karl also pinned some hope on the advancing time. By the office clock it was already a quarter past five, Renell might be back at any time, perhaps he was back already, because it must have struck him that Robinson had failed to return, and, it further occurred to Karl, Delamarche and Renell must have been in the proximity of the Hotel Occidental, because otherwise Robinson in his wretched state would not have got there. Now, if Renell found Robinson in his bed, as must surely happen, then all would be well. For Renell was a practical character, particularly when his own interests were at stake, and he would find a way of speedily getting Robinson out of the hotel, which would be easier as Robinson would have got his strength back by now, and besides Delamarche would probably be waiting for him outside the hotel as well. Once Robinson was gone, Karl would be much more comfortable with the Head Waiter, and might get away with a severe reprimand this time. Then he and Therese might discuss whether he could tell the Head Cook the truth – he for his part couldn’t see why not – and if that was possible, the whole affair would have passed without doing him any particular damage.","Nevertheless Karl was more composed than before. Even the fact that the head waiter evidently attached so little importance to his affair could be taken as a good sign. This was after all only understandable. A lift boy is a nobody, so he cannot allow himself liberties, but then again precisely because he’s a nobody , he cannot get up to exceptional mischief either. Besides, in his youth the head waiter himself had been a lift boy—which was still the great pride of this generation of lift boys—it was he who had first organized the lift boys, and there must certainly have been an occasion when he left his post without permission, even if no one could force him to recall that and though it was undeniably true that, precisely because he was a former lift boy, he saw it as his duty to keep that profession in order by occasionally exercising relentless severity. Karl now pinned his hopes on the advancing hour. According to the office clock, it was already shortly after a quarter past six, and Renell could come back at any moment; perhaps he was even there already, for he must surely have noticed that Robinson had not returned; besides, Karl now realized that Delamarche and Renell could not have been that far from the Occidental Hotel, for in his miserable condition Robinson could not have found his way there alone. If Renell encountered Robinson in his bed, as was bound to happen, everything would be fine. For given Renell’s practical bent, especially when his own interests were concerned, he would somehow find a way to remove Robinson from the hotel, which could be brought about more easily now that Robinson had meanwhile gained a little strength, and besides, Delamarche was probably already waiting outside the hotel, ready to take delivery. Once Robinson had at last been removed, Karl could approach the head waiter much more calmly, and this time maybe he would get off with a reprimand, although it might be a fairly severe one. Then he would speak with Therese about whether to tell the head cook the truth—he himself could see no obstacle—and if it were possible, the matter could be disposed of without causing any real damage."
"„Nimmt denn Brunelda irgend eine Rücksicht?"" rief Robinson aus und stieß, ohne daß er Karl darauf vorbe- reitet hätte, mit der Faust eine Tür auf, zu der sie eben gekommen waren.","""Is Brunelda showing any consideration?"" exclaimed Robinson and, without having prepared Karl for it, threw his fist open a door they had just come to.","‘When has Brunelda ever shown any compassion?’ cried Robinson, and with his fist – for which Karl was quite unprepared – he banged open the door they were just passing.","“Does Brunelda ever show the slightest consideration?” cried Robinson, and without giving Karl any advance warning, he held out his fist and pushed open a door that they had just reached."
"„Ist Dir vielleicht plötzlich schlecht geworden?"" frag- te der Oberkellner listig. Karl sah ihn prüfend an und antwortete: „Nein."" „Also nicht einmal schlecht ist Dir geworden?"" schrie der Oberkellner desto stärker. „Also dann mußt Du ja irgendeine großartige Lüge erfunden haben. Heraus damit. Was für eine Entschuldigung hast Du?"" „Ich habe nicht gewußt, daß man telephonisch um Erlaubnis bitten muß"", sagte Karl. „Das ist allerdings köstlich"", sagte der Oberkellner, faßte Karl beim Rock- kragen und brachte ihn fast in Schwebe vor eine Dienst- ordnung der Lifs, die auf der Wand aufgenagelt war. Auch der Portier gieng hinter ihnen zur Wand hin. „Da! lies!"" sagte der Oberkellner und zeigte auf einen Para- graphen. Karl glaubte er solle es für sich lesen. „Laut!"" kommandierte aber der Oberkellner. Statt laut zu lesen, sagte Karl in der Hoffnung damit den Oberkellner bes- ser zu beruhigen: „Ich kenne den Paragraphen, ich habe ja die Dienstordnung auch bekommen und genau gele- sen. Aber gerade eine solche Bestimmung, die man nie- mals braucht, vergißt man. Ich diene schon zwei Monate und habe niemals meinen Posten verlassen."" „Dafür wirst Du ihn jetzt verlassen"", sagte der Oberkellner, gieng zum Tisch hin, nahm das Verzeichnis wieder zur Hand, als wolle er darin weiterlesen, schlug damit aber auf den Tisch als sei es ein nutzloser Fetzen und gieng, starke Röte auf Stirn und Wangen, kreuz und quer im Zimmer herum. „Wegen eines solchen Bengels hat man das nötig. Solche Aufregungen beim Nachtdienst!"" stieß er einigemal hervor. „Wissen Sie wer gerade hinauffah- ren wollte, als dieser Kerl hier vom Lif weggelaufen ist?"" wandte er sich zum Portier. Und er nannte einen Namen, bei dem es den Portier, der gewiß alle Gäste kannte und bewerten konnte, so schauderte, daß er schnell auf Karl hinsah, als sei nur dessen Existenz eine Bestätigung dessen, daß der Träger jenes Namens eine Zeitlang bei einem Lif dessen Junge weggelaufen war, nutzlos hatte warten müssen. „Das ist schrecklich!"" sag- te der Portier und schüttelte langsam in grenzenloser Beunruhigung den Kopf gegen Karl hin, welcher ihn traurig ansah und dachte, daß er nun auch für die Be- griffstützigkeit dieses Mannes werde büßen müssen. Ich kenne Dich übrigens auch schon"", sagte der Portier und streckte seinen dicken großen steif gespannten Zei- gefinger aus. „Du bist der einzige Junge, welcher mich grundsätzlich nicht grüßt. Was bildest Du Dir eigentlich ein! Jeder der an der Portierloge vorübergeht muß mich grüßen. Mit den übrigen Portiers kannst Du es halten, wie Du willst, ich aber verlange gegrüßt zu werden. Ich tue zwar manchmal so, als ob ich nicht aufpaßte, aber Du kannst ganz ruhig sein, ich weiß sehr genau, wer mich grüßt oder nicht, Du Lümmel."" Und er wandte sich von Karl ab und schritt hochaufgerichtet auf den Oberkellner zu, der aber statt sich zu des Portiers Sache zu äußern, sein Frühstück beendete und eine Morgen- zeitung überflog, die ein Diener eben ins Zimmer her- eingereicht hatte.","""Have you suddenly gotten sick?"" asked the head waiter cunningly. Karl looked at him searchingly and answered: ""No."" ""So you didn't even feel sick?"" yelled the head waiter all the more loudly. ""Well then you must have invented some great lie. Out with it. What excuse do you have?"" ""I didn't know you had to ask for permission by phone,"" said Karl. ""That's really delicious,"" said the head waiter, grabbed Karl by the collar of his coat and brought him almost to a halt in front of the Lifs' service regulations, which was nailed to the wall. The porter also went behind them to the wall. ""There! read!"" said the head waiter and pointed to a paragraph. Karl thought he should read it for himself. ""Loud!"" but commanded the head waiter. Instead of reading aloud, Karl said, hoping to calm the head waiter better: “I know the paragraph, I also received the service regulations and read them carefully. But just such a determination, which one never needs, one forgets. I've been in the service for two months and I've never left my post."" ""You're going to leave him now for that,"" said the head waiter, walking over to the table and picking up the list again, as if about to continue reading it, but he banged it on the table as if it were a useless rag and went all over the room, red on the forehead and cheeks. ""Because of such a brat you have to do it. What a fuss on night duty!"" he blurted out a few times. ""Do you know who was about to go up when this fellow ran away from the lift?"" he turned to the porter. And he mentioned a name that made the porter, who certainly knew and could rate all the guests, shudder so much that he glanced quickly at Karl as if his existence were just a confirmation of the fact that the bearer of that name had been with a Lif for a while whose boy had run away had had to wait uselessly. ""That's horrible!"" said the porter, slowly shaking his head at Karl in boundless anxiety, who looked at him sadly and thought that he would now have to pay for this man's stupidity. By the way, I know you too yes,"" said the porter and stretched out his thick, large, stiffly stretched index finger. ""You're the only boy who doesn't greet me on principle. What are you imagining! Everyone who passes the porter's lodge has to greet me. You can do whatever you want with the other porters, but I ask to be greeted. I sometimes act as if I'm not paying attention, but you can be very calm, I know very well who greets me or not, you lout."" And he turned away from Karl and walked up straight to the head waiter, who but instead of commenting on the porter's business, finished his breakfast and perused a morning paper which a servant had just handed into the room.","‘Did you suddenly feel sick?’ the Head Waiter asked cunningly. Karl looked at him searchingly and replied ‘No.’ ‘So you didn’t even feel sick?’ screamed the Head Waiter even more loudly. ‘Then you must have some truly wonderful excuse. All right, let’s hear it. What’s your story?’ ‘I didn’t know you had to ask for permission by telephone,’ said Karl. ‘Now that is priceless,’ said the Head Waiter, and grabbed Karl by the lapels and lifted him bodily up to a copy of the lift regulations which was pinned on the wall. The porter also followed them across to the wall. ‘ There! Read that!’ said the Head Waiter, indicating one of the paragraphs. Karl thought he was meant to read it to himself. ‘Out loud!’ ordered the Head Waiter. But instead of reading it aloud, hoping it would calm the Head Waiter more effectively, Karl said: ‘I know the paragraph, I was given a copy of the rules myself and read them carefully. But that sort of rule, which you never use, is most easily forgotten. I’ve been serving for two months, and never once left my post.’ ‘But you’re about to leave it now,’ said the Head Waiter, and walked over to the table, picked up the inventory as though to go on reading from it, but instead smacked it down on the table like a useless piece of bumf and, with scarlet cheek and brow, began criss-crossing the room. ‘ That a rascal like you should be the cause of such commotion on night duty!’ he exclaimed from time to time. ‘Do you know who was waiting to take the lift up at the time when this fellow walked off?’ he asked the porter. And he gave a name that caused the porter (who must have a pretty shrewd idea of all the guests) to shudder violently, and cast a quick look at Karl, as if his mere presence was proof that the man who bore that name had had to wait in vain for the lift the boy had forsaken. ‘But that’s terrible!’ said the porter, and slowly, in infinite disquiet, shook his head at Karl, who looked at him sorrowfully and thought he would now have to pay for the man’s slow-wittedness on top of everything else. ‘I know you too,’ said the porter, jabbing out a big fat stiff index finger. ‘You are the only boy not in the habit of greeting me. Who do you think you are! Everyone who goes past the porter’s lodge has to greet me. You can do what you like with the other porters, but I insist on being greeted. I may sometimes behave as though I weren’t paying attention, but rest assured, I know all too well who greets me and who doesn’t, you rapscallion.’ And he turned away from Karl and strode loftily over to the Head Waiter, who, instead of commenting on the porter’s case, was finishing his breakfast and perusing a morning newspaper which a servant had just delivered into the room.","“Perhaps you became ill all of a sudden?” the head waiter asked craftily. Karl gave him a searching look and answered: “No.” “Then you weren’t even ill?” the head waiter shouted, even louder than before. “Then you must have fabricated some big lie. Out with it. So what’s your excuse?” “I didn’t know one had to request permission by telephone,” said Karl. “Well, that’s quite priceless,” said the head waiter, and seizing Karl by the collar of his coat, carried him, almost floating in the air, to the official regulations for the lifts, which were nailed to the wall. The porter followed them to the wall. “There. Read that,” said the head waiter, pointing to a paragraph. Karl thought that he was supposed to read it silently. “Out loud!” the head waiter commanded. Rather than read it aloud, Karl said in hopes of calming the head waiter: “I’m familiar with that paragraph; I did of course receive the official regulations and read them carefully. But that is precisely the kind of stipulation one forgets since one never has any need of it. I’ve been serving here for two months and never once left my post.” “You will now, though,” said the head waiter, and walking over to the table, he picked up the ledger again, as though he wished to go on reading, but slapped it down on the table instead, as if it were a useless rag, and began to walk up and down the room, forehead and cheeks aflame. “And all for such a rascal! Such excitement on the night shift!” he exclaimed several times. “Do you know who was about to go up when this fellow ran away from his lift?” he said, turning to the porter. He named a name, and the porter, who certainly knew all of the guests and could tell their worth, was so horrified that he glanced at Karl, as if only the sheer existence of the latter could confirm that the owner of such an illustrious name had had to wait in vain for some time at a lift whose operator had run away. “That’s dreadful!” the porter said, shaking his head slowly in boundless unease at Karl, who gazed sadly at him, thinking that now he would have to pay for this fellow’s obtuseness in addition to everything else. “Besides, I know you,” said the porter, extending his large fat index finger and pointing it stiffly at Karl. “You’re the only boy who consistently refuses to greet me. What on earth do you think you’re doing? Everyone who passes the porter’s lodge must greet me. While you may do as you wish with the rest of the porters, I expect to be greeted. Sometimes I act as though I were not watching, but even if you are absolutely quiet, I know precisely who greets me and who does not, you lout.” He turned away from Karl and, rising to his full height, strode toward the head waiter, who, instead of commenting on the porter’s affair, finished his breakfast and glanced at a morning newspaper, which a servant had just handed in to the room."
"„Ich sehe ja nichts"", sagte er und wollte den Gucker loswerden, aber den Gucker hielt sie fest und den auf ihrer Brust eingebetteten Kopf konnte er weder zurück noch seitwärts schieben.","""I don't see anything,"" he said, wanting to get rid of the peep, but she held the peep and he couldn't move the head embedded on her chest back or sideways.","‘I can’t see a thing,’ he said, and tried to remove the glasses, but she held them in place, while his head, was so cushioned on her breast he could move it neither sideways nor back.","“I can’t see anything,” he said, and tried to get rid of the glasses, but she held them tight, and in any case he could not push his head, which was embedded on her breast, back or even to the side."
"„Mach keine Dummheiten Roßmann"", sagte Robin- son ganz nahe an Karls Gesicht, „verscherze Dir nicht diese schöne Gelegenheit. Wo bekommst Du denn gleich einen Posten? Wer kennt Dich? Wen kennst Du? Wir, zwei Männer, die schon viel erlebt haben und große Erfahrung besitzen, sind wochenlang herumgelaufen, ohne Arbeit zu bekommen. Es ist nicht leicht, es ist sogar verzweifelt schwer.""","""Don't do anything stupid Rossmann,"" said Robinson very close to Karl's face, ""don't waste this wonderful opportunity. Where are you going to get a job? Who knows you? Who do you know? We, two men who have experienced a lot very experienced have walked around for weeks without getting a job. It's not easy, it's even desperately hard.""","‘Don’t be an idiot, Rossmann,’ said Robinson, very close to Karl’s face, ‘don’t pass up this fine opportunity. Where else will you get a job right away? Who knows you? Whom do you know?’ We, two men who have knocked around a lot and have a lot of experience, went around for weeks without finding any work. It’s not easy, in fact it’s desperately hard.’","“Don’t be stupid, Rossmann,” said Robinson, who was now very close to Karl’s face, “don’t throw away this wonderful opportunity. Where would you get another post right away? Who knows you? Whom do you know? Take us two, men who’ve been through a great deal and have a considerable amount of experience; we ran around for weeks without finding work. It is not easy, it’s even desperately difficult.”"
"„Ich werde also"", sagte Robinson und begleitete die Rede mit behaglichen Handbewegungen – die Elbogen hatte er auf das Geländer aufgestützt – „zunächst Dir alles erklären und die Vorräte zeigen. Du bist gebildet und hast sicher eine schöne Schrif, Du könntest also gleich ein Verzeichnis aller der Sachen machen, die wir da haben. Das hat sich Brunelda schon längst gewünscht. Wenn morgen Vormittag schönes Wetter ist, werden wir Brunelda bitten, daß sie sich auf den Balkon setzt und inzwischen werden wir ruhig und ohne sie zu stören im Zimmer arbeiten können. Denn darauf, Roßmann, mußt Du vor allem Acht geben. Nur nicht Brunelda stören. Sie hört alles, wahrscheinlich hat sie als Sängerin so emp- findliche Ohren. Du rollst z. B. das Faß mit Schnaps, das hinter den Kästen steht, heraus, es macht ja Lärm, weil es schwer ist und dort überall verschiedene Sachen her- umliegen so daß man es nicht mit einemmal durchrollen kann. Brunelda liegt z. B. ruhig auf dem Kanapee und fängt Fliegen, die sie überhaupt sehr belästigen. Du glaubst also, sie kümmert sich um Dich nicht und rollst Dein Faß weiter. Sie liegt noch immer ruhig. Aber in einem Augenblick, wo Du es gar nicht erwartest und wo Du am wenigsten Lärm machst, setzt sie sich plötzlich aufrecht, schlägt mit beiden Händen auf das Kanapee, daß man sie vor Staub nicht sieht – seit wir hier sind habe ich das Kanapee nicht ausgeklopf, ich kann ja nicht, sie liegt doch immerfort darauf – und fängt schrecklich zu schreien an, wie ein Mann, und schreit so stundenlang. Das Singen haben ihr die Nachbarn verbo- ten, das Schreien aber kann ihr niemand verbieten, sie muß schreien, übrigens geschieht es ja jetzt nur selten, ich und Delamarche sind sehr vorsichtig geworden. Es hat ihr ja auch sehr geschadet. Einmal ist sie ohnmäch- tig geworden und ich habe – Delamarche war gerade weg – den Studenten von nebenan holen müssen, der hat sie aus einer großen Flasche mit einer Flüssigkeit be- spritzt, es hat auch geholfen, aber diese Flüssigkeit hat einen unerträglichen Geruch gehabt, noch jetzt wenn man die Nase zum Kanapee hält, riecht man es. Der Student ist sicher unser Feind, wie alle hier, Du mußt Dich auch vor allen in acht nehmen und Dich mit kei- nem einlassen.""","""So,"" said Robinson and accompanied the speech with comfortable hand movements - he had propped his elbows on the railing - ""first of all I'll explain everything to you and show you the supplies. You're educated and I'm sure you have a nice handwriting, so you could use one right away Make a list of all the things we have there. Brunelda has wanted that for a long time. If the weather is fine tomorrow morning, we'll ask Brunelda to sit on the balcony and meanwhile we'll be quiet in the room without disturbing her ""Because that's what you have to be careful of, Roßmann. Just don't disturb Brunelda. She hears everything, probably as a singer she has sensitive ears. For example, you roll the barrel with schnapps behind the cases stands out, it makes a lot of noise because it's heavy and there are different things lying around so that you can't roll through it all at once Brunelda, for example, lies quietly on the couch and catches flies that si e very bother at all. So you think she doesn't care about you and roll your barrel on. She is still calm. But at a moment when you don't expect it and when you make the least noise, she suddenly sits up, bangs both hands on the sofa so that you can't see her because of the dust - I haven't had the sofa since we've been here knocked out, I can't, she's always lying on it - and starts screaming terribly, like a man, and screams like that for hours. The neighbors have forbidden her from singing, but nobody can forbid her from screaming, she has to scream, by the way it rarely happens now, I and Delamarche have become very careful. It did her a lot of harm. Once she fainted and I had to fetch the student next door – Delamarche was just gone – who splashed her with a liquid from a large bottle, it also helped, but the liquid had an unbearable smell , even now if you put your nose to the sofa, you can smell it. The student is certainly our enemy, like everyone here, you have to be careful of everyone and not get involved with anyone.""","‘So,’ said Robinson, accompanying his speech with complacent hand movements – he had his elbows propped on the railing – ‘so I’ll explain everything to you and show you the supplies. You’re educated, and I’m sure you write a clear hand, so you could draw up an inventory of all the things we have here. Brunelda has been wanting that for ages. If it’s fine tomorrow morning, we’ll ask Brunelda to sit out on the balcony, and then we’ll be able to work quietly inside without disturbing her. Because one thing you have to bear in mind, Rossmann, above all. Don’t disturb Brunelda. She hears everything, it’s probably because she’s a singer that she has such terribly sensitive ears. For instance if you roll out the brandy barrel behind the chests, that makes a noise just because it’s so heavy, and then there are various things lying in its path, so you can’t roll it away at one fell swoop. Say Brunelda is lying quietly on the sofa, catching flies, which are a terrific nuisance for her. You think she’s not paying any attention, and carry on rolling the barrel. She’s still lying peacefully. But in a moment, and when you’re least expecting it, and when you’re making the least amount of noise, she suddenly sits bolt upright, bangs the sofa with both hands, so that she disappears in a cloud of dust – I haven’t been able to beat the sofa in all the time we’ve been here, after all how can I, she’s always lying on it – and starts this terrible shouting like a man, and goes on for hours. The neighbours have stopped her from singing, but no one can stop her from shouting, she has to shout, it only happens quite rarely nowadays by the way, Delamarche and I are very careful. It did her a lot of harm as well. Once she became unconscious, so – Delamarche was away at the time – I had to fetch the student from next door, who sprayed her with some liquid from a big bottle, and it helped too, but the liquid had an insufferable smell, even now if you stick your nose in the sofa, you can still smell it. That student is definitely an enemy of ours, like everyone here, you should be wary of everyone and not get involved with any of them.’","“Well then,” said Robinson, accompanying his remarks with complacent gestures—he had propped up his elbows on the balustrade—“first I’ll explain everything to you, and then I’ll show you the supplies. You’re an educated man and must have beautiful handwriting, so you could make a list of everything we have. Brunelda has wanted this done for a long time. If the weather tomorrow is good, we’ll ask Brunelda to sit out on the balcony, and then we can work away in the room, quietly and without disturbing her. And that, Rossmann, must be your top priority. Not to disturb Brunelda, above all else. She can hear everything—as a singer she probably has especially sensitive ears. Say you’re rolling out the schnapps barrel from behind the closets; since it’s heavy, it makes a lot of noise, and because of all those objects lying about everywhere you can’t just roll it along. Brunelda is, say, lying quietly on the settee catching flies—she’s especially bothered by them. So you think she’s paying no notice to you and go on rolling your barrel. But in the blink of an eye, just when you don’t expect it and are making the least amount of noise, she suddenly sits up and hits the settee with both hands, with the result that one cannot even see her because of all the dust swirling about— during the entire time we’ve been here, I’ve never beaten the settee; there’s no way I can, for she’s always lying there—and she starts to shout horribly, like a man, and goes on shouting for hours. Her neighbors forbade her to sing, but no one can forbid her to shout; she has to shout, and, by the way, this happens only rarely now— Delamarche and I have become very careful. Besides, that shouting harmed her too. Once she even lost consciousness and—Delamarche happened to be away—I had to send for the student next door; he sprayed her with some liquid from a large bottle, which helped but gave off an unbearable stench, which you can still smell if you put your nose up to the settee. That student is certainly our enemy, like everyone else here; you must be wary of everyone and keep your distance.”"
"Ein ruhiges Schlafzimmer war dieser Schlafsaal aller- dings nicht. Denn da jeder einzelne die freie Zeit von zwölf Stunden verschiedenartig auf Essen, Schlaf, Ver- gnügen und Nebenverdienst verteilte, war im Schlafsaal immerfort die größte Bewegung. Da schliefen einige und zogen die Decken über die Ohren um nichts zu hören; wurde doch einer geweckt, dann schrie er so wütend über das Geschrei der andern, daß auch die übrigen noch so guten Schläfer nicht standhalten konnten. Fast jeder Junge hatte seine Pfeife, es wurde damit eine Art Luxus getrieben, auch Karl hatte sich eine angeschaf und fand bald Geschmack an ihr. Nun durfe aber im Dienst nicht geraucht werden, die Folge dessen war, daß im Schlaf- saal jeder solange er nicht unbedingt schlief auch rauch- te. Infolge dessen stand jedes Bett in einer eigenen Rauchwolke und alles in einem allgemeinen Dunst. Es war unmöglich durchzusetzen, trotzdem eigentlich die Mehrzahl grundsätzlich zustimmte, daß in der Nacht nur an einem Ende des Saales das Licht brennen sollte. Wäre dieser Vorschlag durchgedrungen, dann hätten diejenigen, welche schlafen wollten, dies im Dunkel der einen Saalhälfe – es war ein großer Saal mit vierzig Bet- ten – ruhig tun können, während die andern im beleuch- teten Teil Würfel oder Karten hätten spielen und alles übrige besorgen können, wozu Licht nötig war. Hätte einer dessen Bett in der beleuchteten Saalhälfe stand, schlafen gehn wollen, so hätte er sich in eines der freien Betten im Dunkel legen können, denn es standen immer genug Betten frei und niemand wendete gegen eine der- artige vorübergehende Benützung seines Bettes durch einen Andern etwas ein. Aber es gab keine Nacht, in der diese Einteilung befolgt worden wäre. Immer wieder fanden sich z. B. zwei, welche nachdem sie das Dunkel zu etwas Schlaf ausgenützt hatten, Lust bekamen in ih- ren Betten auf einem zwischen sie gelegten Brett Karten zu spielen und natürlich drehten sie eine passende elek- trische Lampe auf, deren stechendes Licht die Schlafen- den, wenn sie ihm zugewendet waren, auffahren ließ. Man wälzte sich zwar noch ein wenig herum, fand aber schließlich auch nichts besseres zu tun, als mit dem gleichfalls geweckten Nachbar auch ein Spiel bei neuer Beleuchtung vorzunehmen. Und wieder dampfen na- türlich auch alle Pfeifen. Es gab allerdings auch einige, die um jeden Preis schlafen wollten – Karl gehörte meist zu ihnen – und die statt den Kopf aufs Kissen zu legen, ihn mit dem Kissen bedeckten oder hinein einwickelten, aber wie wollte man im Schlaf bleiben, wenn der nächste Nachbar in tiefer Nacht aufstand, um vor dem Dienst noch ein wenig in der Stadt dem Vergnügen nachzugehn, wenn er in dem am Kopfende des eigenen Bettes ange- brachten Waschbecken laut und wassersprühend sich wusch, wenn er die Stiefel nicht nur polternd anzog son- dern stampfend sich besser in sie hineintreten wollte – fast alle hatten trotz amerikanischer Stiefelform zu enge Stiefel – um dann schließlich, da ihm eine Kleinigkeit in seiner Ausstattung fehlte, das Kissen des Schlafenden zu heben, unter dem man allerdings schon längst geweckt, nur darauf wartete, auf ihn loszufahren. Nun waren aber auch alle Sportsleute und junge meist kräfige Burschen, die keine Gelegenheit zu sportlichen Übungen versäu- men wollten. Und man konnte sicher sein, wenn man in der Nacht mitten aus dem Schlaf durch großen Lärm geweckt aufsprang, auf dem Boden neben seinem Bett zwei Ringkämpfer zu finden und bei greller Beleuchtung auf allen Betten in der Runde aufrecht stehende Sachver- ständige in Hemd und Unterhosen. Einmal fiel anläßlich eines solchen nächtlichen Boxkampfes einer der Kämp- fer über den schlafenden Karl und das erste, was Karl beim Öffnen der Augen erblickte, war das Blut, das dem Jungen aus der Nase rann und ehe man noch etwas dage- gen unternehmen konnte das ganze Bettzeug überfloß. Of verbrachte Karl fast die ganzen zwölf Stunden mit Versuchen, einige Stunden Schlaf zu gewinnen, trotz- dem es ihn auch sehr lockte an den Unterhaltungen der andern teilzunehmen; aber immer wieder schien es ihm, daß alle andern in ihrem Leben einen Vorsprung vor ihm hätten, den er durch fleißigere Arbeit und ein wenig Verzichtleistung ausgleichen müsse. Trotzdem ihm also hauptsächlich seiner Arbeit wegen am Schlaf sehr gele- gen war, beklagte er sich doch weder gegenüber der Oberköchin noch gegenüber Terese über die Verhält- nisse im Schlafsaal, denn erstens trugen im Ganzen und Großen alle Jungen schwer daran ohne sich ernstlich zu beklagen und zweitens war die Plage im Schlafsaal ein notwendiger Teil seiner Aufgabe als Lifjunge, die er ja aus den Händen der Oberköchin dankbar übernommen hatte.","However, this dormitory was not a quiet bedroom. For since each individual divided the free time of twelve hours into eating, sleeping, having fun and earning an extra income, the greatest movement was always in the dormitory. Then some slept and pulled the blankets over their ears so as not to hear anything; if one was woken up, he screamed so furiously at the screams of the others that even the rest of the sleepers, no matter how good they were, could not stand it. Almost every boy had his pipe, a kind of luxury was practiced with it, Karl had also bought one and soon developed a taste for it. But smoking was not allowed on duty, the result of which was that everyone in the dormitory smoked as long as they were not necessarily asleep. As a result, each bed stood in its own cloud of smoke and everything in a general haze. It was impossible to push through, although the majority actually agreed in principle that the light should only be on at one end of the hall at night. If this proposal had gone through, then those who wanted to sleep could have done so in the dark in one half of the room - it was a large room with forty beds - while the others in the lighted part would have played dice or cards and everything the rest, for which light was necessary. If someone whose bed was in the illuminated half of the hall wanted to go to sleep, he could have lain down in one of the free beds in the dark, because there were always enough beds free and nobody objected to such temporary use of his bed by someone else something a. But there was no night when this division was followed. Again and again z. B. Two, who, after having taken advantage of the darkness to get some sleep, felt like playing cards in their beds on a board placed between them, and of course they turned on a suitable electric lamp, the piercing light of which the sleeping ones , if they were turned to him, let rise. They rolled around a little more, but finally found nothing better to do than to play a game in the new light with the neighbor who had also been woken up. And again, of course, all the pipes are steaming. However, there were also a few who wanted to sleep at all costs - Karl was mostly one of them - and instead of laying their heads on the pillow they covered it with the pillow or wrapped it in it, but how could you stay asleep when the next-door neighbor got up in the middle of the night to enjoy a bit of fun in the city before going to work, when he washed himself loudly and spraying water in the washbasin at the head of his own bed, when he put on his boots not just rattling but stamping wanted to step into them better - almost everyone had boots that were too tight, despite the American boot shape - and then finally, since he was missing a small thing in his outfit, lifted the sleeping man's pillow, under which, however, one had long since been awakened, only waiting for it to drive him away. But they were all sports people and mostly strong youngsters who didn't want to miss any opportunity for physical exercise. And you could be sure, if you jumped up in the middle of your sleep at night, roused by a great noise, to find two wrestlers on the floor next to your bed and, in the bright lights, on all the beds around you, experts in shirts and underpants standing upright . Once, on the occasion of such a nightly boxing match, one of the fighters fell over the sleeping Karl and the first thing Karl saw when he opened his eyes was the blood running out of the boy's nose and before you could do anything about it Whole bedding overflowed. Karl often spent most of the twelve hours trying to get a few hours of sleep, although he was also very tempted to take part in the conversations of the others; but time and again it seemed to him that everyone else in their lives had a head start on him, which he had to compensate for by working harder and making sacrifices a little. Although sleep was important to him, mainly because of his work, he never complained to either the head cook or Terese about the conditions in the dormitory, because on the whole all the boys had a hard time with it without seriously complaining and secondly, the nuisance in the dormitory was a necessary part of his job as lifjunge, which he had gratefully taken over from the head cook's hands.","Now this dormitory was anything but a quiet place to sleep. For, since each of them divided up his twelve hours off, between eating, sleeping, pleasure and work on the side, there was a loud and continual commotion in the dormitory. There were some who were asleep, with the blankets pulled up over their ears in order to eliminate the noise; but if one of these was awakened, then he would scream so angrily at the shouting of the others, that none of his fellow sleepers could remain so. Almost every one of the boys owned a pipe, pipes were their luxury, Karl had acquired a pipe for himself too, and soon got a taste for it. Now smoking on duty was not allowed, and as a result everyone in the dormitory who wasn’t asleep would be smoking. Each bed was swathed in its own individual cloud of smoke and a general pall hung over the whole room. In spite of a theoretical agreement to that effect, it proved impossible to maintain the principle of having light at only one end of the room. If that suggestion had prevailed, then the ones who wanted to sleep could have done so quietly in the darkness of one half of the room – which was a large one, containing forty beds – whereas the others could have played dice or cards in the lighted half, and whatever else they needed a light for. If one whose bed was in the light part of the room wanted to sleep, he could have lain down on a vacant bed in the dark half, because there were always sufficient beds, and no one ever objected to the temporary borrowing of a bed by someone else under such circumstances. But there was never a night on which such a division was practised. There would always be a couple of boys, say, who having used the darkness to get some sleep, then felt like a game of cards in their beds, laying a board between them and of course switching on a handy electric light, whose piercing beams would startle the sleepers on whom they fell and wake them up. A sleeper would toss and turn for a while, but in the end there was nothing for it but to start a game with his neighbour, who had been similarly awakened, and with additional illumination. And of course all puffed away on their pipes. There were some – Karl usually among them – who wanted to sleep at any price, and who instead of laying their heads on their pillows covered their heads or rolled them inside their pillows. But how could you remain asleep when your next door neighbour would get up in the dead of night in order to seek some pleasure in town before the beginning of his shift, when he washed at the ewer at the end of your own bed, splashing loudly, when he not only pulled on his boots with much clattering, but stamped his feet to get them properly in – almost all of them had boots that were too small for them despite being of American design – and then finally, missing some item of apparel, raised the pillow of the sleeper, who by now would be long awake and only waiting to have a go at him. And then they were all athletic, young, strong lads, reluctant to let slip any opportunity for physical exercise. So you could be sure that when a great noise startled you out of your night’s sleep you would find two boys wrestling on the floor beside your bed, bright lights, and all around standing up on their beds in shirt and underpants, giving expert commentary. In the course of one such nocturnal bout, one of the combatants fell across Karl’s bed as he lay sleeping, and the first thing Karl saw on opening his eyes was the blood pouring from the boy’s nose, and soaking the bedclothes before anything could be done to prevent it. Often Karl would spend his entire twelve hours attempting to get a couple of hours of sleep, though he was also very tempted to join in the amusements of the others; but he kept thinking that in their lives they had an advantage over him, which he needed to make up for by greater industry and a certain self-denial. Even though his sleep was very important to him, principally for the sake of his work, he didn’t complain about conditions in the dormitory either to the Head Cook or to Therese, because in the first place all the boys more or less endured them without serious complaint, and secondly the torments of the dormitory were an integral part of his job as lift-boy, which he had gratefully accepted from the hands of the Head Cook.","One certainly couldn’t call this dormitory a quiet bedroom. For since each of them divided his twelve hours of free time differently between eating, sleeping, diversions, and side jobs, there was always a great commotion in the dormitory. Some boys slept with the blankets pulled up over their ears so that they would not hear anything; whenever one of them was awakened, he would yell so furiously over the yelling of the others that even the sound sleepers could no longer hold out against the noise. Nearly every youth had a pipe; they were considered a luxury; Karl had acquired one too and soon took pleasure in it. But smoking was not allowed on duty, and as a result everyone in the dormitory smoked, unless one happened to be fast asleep. Consequently, each bed was enveloped in its own cloud of smoke, and all was lost in a general haze. Although approved by the majority, the suggestion that only one light should be left burning at the far end of the dormitory proved impossible to implement. Had it been possible to adopt that suggestion, those who wished to sleep could easily have done so in the dark half of the dormitory—it was a large room with forty beds—whereas the others in the illuminated part of the room could have played dice or cards and carried out any other activities for which light was required. If anyone whose bed lay in the illuminated section had wanted to sleep, he could have lain down in the dark on one of the empty beds, for there were always sufficient empty beds and nobody objected to someone else making such short-term use of his bed. But this arrangement was never put into effect, not even for one night. Again and again there were some, let’s say two, who, after taking advantage of the dark to catch some sleep, felt like playing cards on a board they had spread out between them and switched on an electric lamp, and its piercing light would startle the boys opposite. You could certainly go on tossing and turning for another little while, but in the end your only recourse was to start a game with your neighbor, who had also been awakened in the glow of yet another lamp. By then, of course, all of their pipes were glowing again. But there were certainly others—Karl was usually among them—who, determined to sleep at all costs, rather than put the pillow underneath their head, covered their head with it or wrapped it around their head, but how could you go on sleeping when the occupant of the adjacent bed rose in the middle of the night so that he could enjoy a little diversion in the city before reporting for duty, washed himself noisily, splashed water in the basin affixed to the head of his bed, pulled on his boots noisily, stamping his feet on the floor to force them up higher —they were mostly too tight even though they were American-style boots—and then finally, on discovering that some little item in his clothing was missing, lifted up the pillow, where you lay in wait, long since roused from your sleep, eager to let fly at him. They were all athletic and young, mostly sturdy fellows who did not want to pass up any opportunity for sports. And whenever you were awakened in the middle of the night by some great noise and jumped up, you inevitably encountered two boxers on the floor by your bed and, under glaring lights, numerous experts standing on all of the surrounding beds in their shirts and underpants. Once, during one such nighttime boxing match, one of the combatants fell upon the sleeping Karl, and the first thing he saw on opening his eyes was the blood running from the youth’s nose, and before he could do a thing, the blood poured down all over his bedclothes. Frequently Karl spent almost all of his twelve hours off duty trying to get a few hours’ sleep, although he too was greatly tempted to take part in the other boys’ pastimes; but again and again he was struck by the thought that all of the others had an advantage over him in life, for which he would have to compensate by working more diligently and by making certain sacrifices. Although he was very determined to get his sleep, mostly for the sake of his work, he never complained to the head cook or to Therese about the conditions in the dormitory since, first of all, every youth in there had a hard time as well and never seriously complained about it, and secondly, all that bother in the dormitory was inevitably part of his task as a lift boy, which he had after all gratefully accepted from the hands of the head cook."
"Zuerst dachte er daran zufuß nach Clayton zu gehn, aber das wären drei Stunden angestrengten Marsches ge- wesen, und er wäre dann möglicherweise gerade zu- rechtgekommen, um zu erfahren, daß man schon alle verfügbaren Stellen besetzt hätte. Nach dem Plakat war allerdings die Zahl der Aufzunehmenden unbegrenzt, aber so waren immer alle derartigen Stellenangebote abgefaßt. Karl sah ein, daß er entweder auf die Stelle verzichten oder fahren mußte. Er überrechnete sein Geld, es hätte ohne diese Fahrt für acht Tage gereicht, er schob die kleinen Münzen auf der flachen Hand hin und her. Ein Herr der ihn beobachtet hatte, klopfe ihm auf die Schulter und sagte: „Viel Glück zur Fahrt nach Clayton."" Karl nickte stumm und rechnete weiter. Aber er entschloß sich bald, teilte das für die Fahrt notwendi- ge Geld ab und lief zur Untergrundbahn.","At first he thought of walking to Clayton, but that would have been three hours of arduous walking, and he might have just managed to find that all available positions had already been filled. Admittedly, according to the poster, the number of people to be accepted was unlimited, but that was how all such job offers were always worded. Karl realized that he would either have to give up the job or drive away. He counted his money, it would have lasted for eight days without this trip, he pushed the small coins back and forth on the palm of his hand. A gentleman who had been watching him patted him on the shoulder and said: ""Good luck on the trip to Clayton."" Karl nodded silently and went on with the calculations. But he soon made up his mind, shared the money needed for the trip and ran to the place subway.","At first he thought of going to Clayton on foot, but that would have meant a three-hour slog, and he might arrive just in time to hear that all the places had been filled.

Karl realized that he would either have to decide against it on the spot, or take public transport.

"Wie zur Antwort stieg von der Straße her ein Mann mit einer stark leuchtenden Taschenlampe zu der Grup- pe herauf. Es war ein Kellner aus dem Hotel. Kaum hatte er Karl erblickt, sagte er: „Ich suche Sie schon fast eine halbe Stunde. Alle Böschungen auf beiden Straßen- seiten habe ich schon abgesucht. Die Frau Oberköchin läßt Ihnen nämlich sagen, daß sie den Strohkorb, den sie Ihnen geborgt hat dringend braucht."" „Hier ist er"", sag- te Karl mit einer vor Aufregung unsichern Stimme. Delamarche und Robinson waren in scheinbarer Be- scheidenheit beiseite getreten, wie sie es vor fremden gutgestellten Leuten immer machten. Der Kellner nahm den Korb an sich und sagte: „Dann läßt Sie die Frau Oberköchin fragen, ob Sie es sich nicht überlegt haben und doch vielleicht im Hotel übernachten wollten. Auch die beiden andern Herren wären willkommen, wenn Sie sie mitnehmen wollen. Die Betten sind schon vorberei- tet. Die Nacht ist ja heute warm, aber hier auf der Lehne ist es durchaus nicht ungefährlich zu schlafen, man fin- det öfers Schlangen."" „Da die Frau Oberköchin so freundlich ist, werde ich ihre Einladung doch anneh- men"", sagte Karl und wartete auf eine Äußerung seiner Kameraden. Aber Robinson stand stumpf da und Dela- marche hatte die Hände in den Hosentaschen und schaute zu den Sternen hinauf. Beide bauten offenbar darauf, daß Karl sie ohne weiters mitnehmen werde. Für diesen Fall"", sagte der Kellner, „habe ich den Auf- trag, Sie ins Hotel zu führen und Ihr Gepäck zu tragen."" Dann warten Sie bitte noch einen Augenblick"", sagte Karl und bückte sich um die paar Sachen, die noch her- umlagen, in den Koffer zu legen.","As if in reply, a man with a brightly lit flashlight climbed up to the group from the street. It was a waiter from the hotel. As soon as he saw Karl, he said: ""I've been looking for you for almost half an hour. I've already searched all the embankments on both sides of the road. The head cook has let you know that she urgently needs the straw basket that she lent you."" ""Here it is,"" said Karl in a voice uncertain with excitement. Delamarche and Robinson had stepped aside with apparent modesty, as they always did before well-to-do strangers. The waiter took the basket and said: ""Then the head cook will ask you if you haven't thought about it and maybe want to spend the night in the hotel. The other two gentlemen would also be welcome if you would like to take them with you. The beds are already prepared. The night is warm today, but it's not at all safe to sleep here on the Lehnen, you often find snakes."" ""Since the head cook is so friendly, I'll accept her invitation after all,"" said Karl and waited for a statement from his comrades. But Robinson stood there dully and Delamarche had his hands in his pockets and was looking up at the stars. Both were obviously counting on Karl taking them with him without further ado. In that case,"" said the waiter, ""I have orders to take you to the hotel and carry your luggage."" Then please wait a moment,"" said Karl and bent down to put the few things that were still lying around in the suitcase.","As though in answer a man with a bright torch approached the group from down on the road. He was a waiter from the hotel. No sooner had he spotted Karl than he said: ‘I’ve spent half an hour looking for you. I’ve combed the embankments on both sides of the highway. The head cook sends me to say that she needs the basket she lent you back urgently.’ ‘I’ve got it here,’ said Karl, in a voice shaking with nerves. Delamarche and Robinson had stepped modestly to one side, as they always did when in the presence of powerful strangers (to whom they hadn’t been introduced). The waiter took the basket and said: ‘And then the head cook would like to know whether you’ve had second thoughts, and did want to stay the night in the hotel after all. The other two gentlemen would also be welcome, if you wanted to bring them too. Beds have been made up. Admittedly, it is a mild night but there are some dangers attendant on sleeping out, there are often snakes on these embankments.’ ‘In view of the cook’s kindness, I would like to accept her invitation after all,’ said Karl, and waited for his companions to chime in. But Robinson just stood there, and Delamarche had his hands in his trouser pockets and was gazing up at the stars. Both of them were obviously relying on Karl simply to take them with him. ‘ In that case,’ said the waiter, ‘I have been instructed to show you to the hotel, and to carry your baggage for you.’ ‘ Then just a minute please,’ said Karl, and stooped to pick up one or two things that were lying around, and put them in the suitcase.","As if in response a man with a bright flashlight came climbing up toward the group from the street. It was a waiter from the hotel. No sooner had he spotted Karl than he said: “ I’ve spent almost half an hour looking for you. I’ve already searched through all the bushes on both sides of the road. The head cook says to let you know she urgently needs the straw basket she loaned you.” “Here it is,” said Karl, sounding uncertain in his excitement. Delamarche and Robinson had stepped aside in a seemingly unassuming manner, as they always did before welloff strangers. The waiter took the basket and said: “Well, the head cook wants to know whether you haven’t had second thoughts and wouldn’t perhaps want to spend the night at the hotel. Besides, the other two gentlemen would be welcome if you’d like to take them along. The beds are already prepared. It’s a warm night, but here on this slope it’s not entirely safe sleeping outdoors, for one can encounter snakes.” “Since the head cook is so kind, I shall indeed accept your invitation,” said Karl, and then he waited for his companions to respond. However, Robinson simply stood there impassively; Delamarche gazed up at the stars, with his hands in his pockets. Both evidently took it for granted that Karl would take them along. “Well,” said the waiter, “in that case I have been instructed to take you to the hotel and to carry your bags.” “Then could you please wait a minute,” said Karl, who bent down in order to pick up a few items that still lay about, and put them in the trunk."
"„Was wird jetzt dem Heizer geschehn?"" fragte Karl, vorbei an der letzten Erzählung des Onkels. Er glaubte in seiner neuen Stellung, alles was er dachte auch aus- sprechen zu können.","""What's going to happen to the stoker now?"" asked Karl, past what his uncle had just said. In his new position he believed he could say everything he thought about.","‘What’s going to happen to the stoker now?’ asked Karl, ignoring his uncle’s latest story. It seemed to him that in his new position he was entitled to say whatever was on his mind.","“What will happen to the stoker?” asked Karl, ignoring his uncle’s last remark. In his new position he could, he believed, say anything that crossed his mind."
"Da er sich aber ganz und gar mit Delamarche beschäf- tigen mußte, zumal er dessen Widerstand immer mehr wachsen fühlte und immer sehniger dieser feindliche Körper sich ihm entgegenstemmte, vergaß er tatsächlich, daß er nicht mit Delamarche allein war. Aber nur allzu- bald wurde er daran erinnert, denn plötzlich versagten seine Füße, die Robinson, der sich hinter ihm auf den Boden geworfen hatte, schreiend auseinanderpreßte. Seufzend ließ Karl von Delamarche ab, der noch einen Schritt zurückwich. Brunelda stand mit weit auseinan- dergestellten Beinen und gebeugten Knien in aller ihrer Breite in der Zimmermitte und verfolgte die Vorgänge mit leuchtenden Augen. Als beteilige sie sich tatsächlich an dem Kampf, atmete sie tief, visierte mit den Augen und ließ ihre Fäuste langsam vorrücken. Delamarche schlug seinen Kragen nieder, hatte nun wieder freien Blick und nun gab es natürlich keinen Kampf mehr, sondern bloß eine Bestrafung. Er faßte Karl vorn beim Hemd, hob ihn fast vom Boden und schleuderte ihn, vor Verachtung sah er ihn gar nicht an, so gewaltig gegen einen ein paar Schritte entfernten Schrank, daß Karl im ersten Augenblick meinte, die stechenden Schmerzen im Rücken und am Kopf, die ihm das Aufschlagen am Ka- sten verursachte, stammten unmittelbar von der Hand des Delamarche. „Du Halunke"", hörte er den Dela- marche in dem Dunkel, das vor seinen zitternden Augen entstand, noch laut ausrufen. Und in der ersten Er- schöpfung, in der er vor dem Kasten zusammensank, klangen ihm die Worte „Warte nur"" noch schwach in den Ohren nach.","But since he had to occupy himself completely with Delamarche, especially since he felt his resistance growing more and more sinewy and this hostile body pressed against him, he actually forgot that he was not alone with Delamarche. But all too soon he was reminded of this, for suddenly his feet gave out, which Robinson, who had thrown himself on the ground behind him, was spreading, screaming. Sighing, Karl let go of Delamarche, who took a step back. Brunelda stood in the middle of the room with her legs wide apart and her knees bent, following the proceedings with shining eyes. As if actually participating in the fight, she breathed deeply, sighted, and slowly advanced her fists. Delamarche turned down his collar, had a clear view again and now, of course, there was no more fighting, just punishment. He grabbed Karl by the front of his shirt, almost lifted him off the floor and threw him, he didn't even look at him out of contempt, so violently against a cupboard a few steps away that Karl thought at first the stabbing pains in his back and head , which caused him to hit the box, came directly from Delamarche's hand. ""You scoundrel,"" he heard Delamarche exclaim loudly in the darkness that formed before his trembling eyes. And in the initial exhaustion in which he collapsed in front of the chest, the words ""Just wait"" rang out in him. still faint in the ears.","Thus entirely preoccupied with Delamarche, especially as he could feel his resistance growing stronger by the minute, felt his sinewy enemy body pressing against his more powerfully all the time, he quite forgot he wasn’t alone with Delamarche. But all too soon he was reminded of the fact, because all at once he felt his feet going from under him, Robinson, throwing himself to the ground behind him, was pushing them apart and shouting. With a sigh, Karl let go of Delamarche, who took a further step back, Brunelda was standing there, feet apart, knees bent, in all her breadth in the middle of the room, observing the goings-on with shining eyes. As though participating in the fight herself, she was panting, moving her fists and glowering. Delamarche folded his collar down, now he could see again, and now the fight as such was over, and what followed was merely punishment. He grabbed Karl by his shirt front, almost lifted him off his feet, and hurled him, not even deigning to look at him as he did, with such force against a cupboard just a couple of paces away, that at first Karl thought that the piercing pains in his head and back from his impact against the closet were caused directly by Delamarche’s hand. ‘You rotter!’ he heard Delamarche call out as it grew dark in front of his eyes. And collapsing in exhaustion in front of the closet he heard the words ‘just you wait’ like a distant echo in his ears.","Being so completely preoccupied with Delamarche, particularly since he could feel his resistance grow and the hostile body press every more wirily against him, he truly forgot that he and Delamarche were not alone. However, he was soon reminded of this fact, for all of a sudden his feet gave way, pressed apart by Robinson, who had thrown himself on the ground behind him and was now shouting too. Panting, Karl released Delamarche, who withdrew another step. Brunelda stood in the middle of the room, legs wide apart, knees bent, in her full expanse; she followed the incident with shining eyes. As if she were an actual participant in the fight, she inhaled deeply, took aim with her eyes, and slowly raised her fists. Delamarche turned down his collar, he could now see clearly again, so this could no longer be considered a fight, it was simply punishment. He grasped Karl by the front of his shirt, almost lifting him off the ground, and refusing to look at him out of contempt, he threw him with such force against a cabinet a few paces away that Karl initially thought that the stabbing pain in his back and head, caused by his striking the closet, had been dealt directly by Delamarche’s hand. “You scoundrel,” he could hear Delamarche exclaim in the darkness that rose before his trembling eyes. And in the first few moments of complete exhaustion after he had collapsed beside the chest, the sound of the words “Just wait” still reverberated weakly in his ears."
"„So schwer ist es, dort einen Posten zu bekommen"", sagte Karl mehr für sich.","""It's so hard to get a job there,"" Karl said more to himself.","‘So that’s how hard it is to get a job there,’ said Karl, musingly.","“So it’s that difficult to get a post there,” said Karl, more to himself than to the student."
"„Aber"", wiederholte der Herr Jakob und trat mit et- was steifen Schritten auf Karl zu, „dann bin ich ja Dein Onkel Jakob und Du bist mein lieber Neffe. Ahnte ich es doch die ganze Zeit über"", sagte er zum Kapitän hin, ehe er Karl umarmte und küßte, der alles stumm gesche- hen ließ.","""But,"" repeated Herr Jakob and approached Karl with somewhat stiff steps, ""then I'm your uncle Jakob and you're my dear nephew. I suspected it all along,"" he said to the captain , before he hugged and kissed Karl, who let everything happen in silence.","‘But,’ repeated Mr Jakob and rather stiffly walked up to Karl, ‘then I’m your Uncle Jakob, and you’re my dear nephew. Didn’t I know it all along,’ he said to the captain, before hugging and kissing Karl, who submitted quietly.","“But,” repeated Mr. Jakob, approaching Karl with a rather stiff gait, “but then I am indeed your uncle Jakob, and you are my beloved nephew. Just as I suspected all along,” he said to the captain before embracing and kissing Karl, who endured this display of affection in silence."
"Ein paar Türen weiter waren zwei Frauen auf den Korridor getreten, sie wischten die Hände an ihren Schürzen rein, sahen auf Delamarche und Robinson und schienen sich über sie zu unterhalten. Aus einer Tür sprang noch ein ganz junges Mädchen mit glänzendem blondem Haar und schmiegte sich zwischen die zwei Frauen, indem es sich in ihre Arme einhängte.","A few doors down, two women had stepped into the corridor, wiping their hands on their aprons, looking at Delamarche and Robinson and seeming to be talking about them. Another very young girl with shiny blond hair jumped out of a door and snuggled between the two women, hanging on to their arms.","A few doors along, two women had stepped out on to the corridor, they wiped their hands on their aprons, looked at Delamarche and Robinson, and appeared to be discussing them. From another door, a very young girl with shiny blond hair jumped out, linked arms with the two women, and pressed herself against them.","A few doors down two women had entered the corridor; they cleaned their hands on their aprons, looked at Delamarche and Robinson, and seemed to be talking to them. Then a very young girl with glistening blond hair jumped out from a doorway and snuggled up between the two women, linking arms with them."
"„Er war im Hotel occidental angestellt"", sagte Dela- marche und trat an die Seite des Polizeimanns. „Nein"", rief Karl und stampfe mit dem Fuße auf, „es ist nicht wahr."" Delamarche sah ihn mit spöttisch zugespitztem Munde an, als könne er noch ganz andere Dinge verra- ten. Unter die Kinder brachte die unerwartete Aufre- gung Karls große Bewegung und sie zogen zu Dela- marche hin, um lieber von dort aus Karl genau anzu- sehn. Robinson hatte den Kopf völlig aus dem Wagen gesteckt und verhielt sich vor Spannung ganz ruhig; hie und da ein Augenzwinkern war seine einzige Bewegung. Der Bursche im Tor schlug in die Hände vor Vergnügen, die Frau neben ihm gab ihm einen Stoß mit dem Elbo- gen, damit er ruhig sei. Die Gepäckträger hatten gerade Frühstückspause und erschienen sämtlich mit großen Töpfen schwarzen Kaffees, in dem sie mit Stangenbro- den herumrührten. Einige setzten sich auf den Trottoir- rand, alle schlürfen den Kaffee sehr laut.","""He was employed at the Hotel Occidental,"" said Delamarche, stepping over to the policeman's side. ""No,"" cried Karl, stamping his foot, ""it's not true."" Delamarche looked at him with a mockingly pursed mouth. Karl's unexpected excitement aroused great excitement among the children, and they moved to Delamarche's, preferring to have a closer look at Karl from there.Robinson was completely out of his mind The lad in the gate clapped his hands with pleasure, the woman beside him elbowed him to make him quiet. The porters were on their break for breakfast and they all came out with big pots of black coffee, stirring them with breadsticks, some sat on the sidewalk, everyone sipped the coffee very loudly.","‘He was working at the Hotel Occidental,’ said Delamarche, repositioning himself next to the policeman. ‘ No,’ cried Karl and stamped his foot, ‘that’s not true.’ Delamarche looked at him with a sardonic twist of his lips, as though he could if he liked make other, far more damaging revelations about him. Karl’s unexpected agitation caused a great commotion among the children, who all moved across to Delamarche, in order to have a better view of Karl. Robinson had stuck his head right out of the window by now, and, in his nervousness, was behaving very quietly; the occasional blink of an eye, nothing more. The fellow in the gateway clapped his hands with glee, the woman next to him jabbed him with her elbow to quieten him down. The porters were just having their breakfast-break, and they all trooped out with large mugs of black coffee, which they were stirring with breadsticks. A few sat down on the edge of the pavement, they all drank their coffee very noisily.","“He was employed at the Occidental Hotel,” said Delamarche, and moved close to the policeman. “No,” cried Karl, stamping his foot, “that isn’t true.” Delamarche looked at him, narrowing his mouth mockingly as though there were matters of a very different nature that he could still disclose. Karl’s unexpected outburst set the children in motion, and they approached Delamarche in order to examine Karl closely from that position. Robinson had leaned his head completely out of the car and was so intent on what was happening that he remained absolutely quiet; he blinked from time to time but otherwise remained motionless. The fellow at the gate clapped his hands in delight; the woman beside him gave him a dig in the side to silence him. Just then the porters were on their breakfast break; all emerged, holding great pots of black coffee, which they stirred with little bread sticks. Several sat down on the pavement, all slurped their coffee."
"Es war natürlich gar nicht mehr die Rede davon, daß die beiden in das Hotel mitgenommen werden könnten. Der Kellner schwang den Koffer auf die Achsel, Karl nahm den Strohkorb und sie giengen. Karl war schon auf der Straße, als er im Nachdenken sich unterbrechend stehen blieb und in das Dunkel hinaufrief: „Hören Sie einmal! Sollte doch einer von Ihnen die Photographie noch haben und mir ins Hotel bringen wollen – er be- kommt den Koffer noch immer und wird – ich schwöre es – nicht angezeigt."" Es kam keine eigentliche Antwort herunter, nur ein abgerissenes Wort war zu hören, der Beginn eines Zurufes Robinsons, dem aber offenbar Delamarche sofort den Mund stopfe. Noch eine lange Weile wartete Karl ob man sich oben nicht doch noch anders entscheiden würde. Zweimal rief er in Abstän- den: „Ich bin noch immer da."" Aber kein Laut antwor- tete, nur einmal rollte ein Stein den Abhang herab, viel- leicht durch Zufall, vielleicht in einem verfehlten Wurf.","Of course there was no longer any talk of taking the two to the hotel. The waiter swung the suitcase over his shoulder, Karl took the straw basket and they left. Karl was already on the street when, thinking, he stopped and called up into the darkness: ""Listen! Should one of you still have the photograph and want to bring it to the hotel for me - he will still get the suitcase and - I swear - will not be reported."" There was no real answer, only a ragged word could be heard, the beginning of a shout from Robinson, but Delamarche apparently immediately shut him up. Karl waited a long while to see if they wouldn't make a different decision upstairs. Twice at intervals he called out: ""I'm still here."" But no sound answered, only once a stone rolled down the slope, perhaps by accident, perhaps in a missed throw.","Of course that put an end to any idea that the two might be taken along to the hotel. The waiter swung the suitcase on to his shoulder, Karl took the straw basket and they set off. Karl was already on the road when, reflecting, he stopped and called into the darkness: ‘Listen to me! If one of you should still have the photograph on him, and would like to bring it to me in the hotel, he’ll still get the suitcase and – I give you my word – immunity from prosecution.’ There was no reply as such, just a blurted word, the beginning of a reply from Robinson before Delamarche obviously stopped his mouth. Karl still waited for a long time for them to reconsider. Twice more he called out: ‘I’m still here.’ But there was no answering sound, just once a stone rolled down the slope, perhaps by chance, perhaps it was a misaimed throw.","And now of course the idea of taking those two to the hotel was completely out of the question. The waiter swung the trunk up on his shoulders, Karl took the straw basket, and they left. Karl was already out on the road when he interrupted his thoughts, stood still, and shouted into the dark: “Listen here! If one of you still has the photograph and wants to bring it to me at the hotel—he will still get the trunk and won’t—I swear—won’t be reported.” There was no real answer from above, only a few muffled sounds, the first words of a call from Robinson, whom Delamarche evidently shut up at once. Karl waited quite a while to see whether the two above might not change their minds. He shouted twice, at intervals: “I’m still here.” But there was no answering cry, only a stone that rolled down the slope, perhaps by accident, perhaps from a poorly aimed throw."
"„Auf! Auf!"" rief Robinson, kaum daß Karl früh die Au- gen öffnete. Der Türvorhang war noch nicht weggezo- gen, aber man merkte an dem durch die Lücken einfal- lenden gleichmäßigen Sonnenlicht, wie spät am Vormit- tag es schon war. Robinson lief eilfertig mit besorgten Blicken hin und her, bald trug er ein Handtuch, bald einen Wasserkübel, bald Wäsche- und Kleidungsstücke und immer wenn er an Karl vorüberkam, suchte er ihn durch Kopfnicken zum Aufstehn aufzumuntern und zeigte durch Hochheben dessen was er gerade in der Hand hielt, wie er sich heute noch zum letzten mal für Karl plage, der natürlich am ersten Morgen von den Einzelheiten des Dienstes nichts verstehen konnte.","""On! Up!"" called Robinson, just as Karl opened his eyes in the morning. The door curtain hadn't been drawn back yet, but you could tell from the even sunlight falling through the gaps how late in the morning it was. Robinson hurriedly ran back and forth with worried looks, now he was carrying a towel, now a bucket of water, now laundry and clothing, and whenever he passed Karl, he tried to encourage him to get up by nodding his head and by lifting up what he was holding Holding hands as he did today for the last time for Karl, who of course couldn't understand anything about the details of the service on the first morning.","cried Robinson, the moment Karl opened his eyes in the morning. The curtain in the doorway had not yet been drawn, but you could see from the even way the sun poured through the cracks that the morning was already well advanced. Robinson was bustling about here and there, with a worried expression on his face, now he was carrying a towel, now a bucket of water, now sundry items of clothing and underwear, and every time he passed Karl, he would nod in his direction to induce him to get up, and show him, by holding up whatever he happened to be carrying, how he was exerting himself on Karl’s behalf, today and for the last time, seeing as he couldn’t of course grasp the intricacies of serving on his very first morning.","cried Robinson the moment Karl opened his eyes. The curtain on the door had not yet been opened, but one could tell from the steady sunlight falling through the chinks how late in the morning it already was. Robinson ran zealously back and forth, looking very preoccupied; first he carried a towel, then a bucket of water, then a few pieces of underwear and some clothing, and whenever he passed Karl, he tried to persuade him to get up by nodding his head and holding up in the air whatever he happened to be carrying, so as to show how hard he was toiling one last time on behalf of Karl, who could naturally not be expected on his first morning there to understand the specific requirements of the service."
"Karl war ihnen auch dankbar, daß sie auf dem Weiter- marsch über das Geld keine Bemerkungen machten und er dachte sogar eine Zeitlang daran ihnen sein ganzes Vermögen einzugestehn, unterließ das aber doch, da sich keine rechte Gelegenheit fand. Gegen Abend kamen sie in eine mehr ländliche fruchtbare Gegend. Ringsherum sah man ungeteilte Felder die sich in ihrem ersten Grün über sanfe Hügel legten, reiche Landsitze umgrenzten die Straße und stundenlang gieng man zwischen den ver- goldeten Gittern der Gärten, mehrmals kreuzten sie den gleichen langsam fließenden Strom und viele mal hörten sie über sich die Eisenbahnzüge auf den hoch sich schwingenden Viadukten donnern.","Karl was also grateful to them that they made no remarks about the money as they marched on, and for a while he even thought of admitting his entire fortune to them, but he refrained from doing so because there was no real opportunity. Toward evening they came to a more rural, fertile region. All around you could see undivided fields lying in their first green over gentle hills, rich country estates bordered the road and for hours you walked between the gilded lattices of the gardens, several times crossing the same slow-flowing stream and many times hearing the above Railway trains thunder on the high swinging viaducts.","Karl was grateful to them for not saying anything about the money when they walked on, and for a time he even toyed with the idea of confessing to them his entire fortune, but, finding no opportunity to do so, he didn’t. By evening they were in more rural, fertile countryside. All around were unbroken fields, covering gentle slopes with their first green, rich country seats abutted the road, and for hours they walked between the gilded fences of the gardens; they crossed the same sluggish river several times, and often heard the trains thundering overhead on high arched viaducts.","Karl was also grateful to them for not commenting about the money as they marched on and for a moment even thought of divulging all his wealth, but he could not find an appropriate moment to do so. Toward evening they arrived in a more fertile rural district. All around they could see open fields, in their first burst of green, laying themselves over gentle hills, opulent country houses lining the road on each side; for hours they walked between the gilded railings of the gardens, crossing the same slow-flowing stream again and again and often hearing trains thundering by on the soaring viaducts."
"In der Reitschule, wo ihn das hoch sich aufauende Automobil des Onkels absetzte, erwartete ihn bereits der Englischprofessor, während Mak ausnahmslos erst später kam. Er konnte aber auch unbesorgt erst später kommen, denn das eigentliche lebendige Reiten fieng erst an, wenn er da war. Bäumten sich nicht die Pferde aus ihrem bisherigen Halbschlaf auf, wenn er eintrat, knallte die Peitsche nicht lauter durch den Raum, er- schienen nicht plötzlich auf der umlaufenden Gallerie einzelne Personen, Zuschauer, Pferdewärter, Reitschüler oder was sie sonst sein mochten? Karl aber nützte die Zeit vor der Ankunf Maks dazu aus, um doch ein wenig wenn auch nur die primitivsten Vorübungen des Reitens zu betreiben. Es war ein langer Mann da, der auf den höchsten Pferderücken mit kaum erhobenem Arm hin- aufreichte und der Karl diesen immer kaum eine Viertel- stunde dauernden Unterricht erteilte. Die Erfolge die Karl hiebei hatte, waren nicht übergroß und er konnte sich viele englische Klagerufe dauernd aneignen, die er während dieses Lernens zu seinem Englischprofessor atemlos ausstieß, der immer am gleichen Türpfosten meist sehr schlafedürfig lehnte. Aber fast alle Unzu- friedenheit mit dem Reiten hörte auf, wenn Mak kam. Der lange Mann wurde weggeschickt und bald hörte man in dem noch immer halbdunklen Saal nichts ande- res, als die Hufe der gallopierenden Pferde und man sah kaum etwas anderes als Maks erhobenen Arm, mit dem er Karl ein Kommando gab. Nach einer halben Stunde solchen wie Schlaf vergehenden Vergnügens, wurde Halt gemacht, Mak war in großer Eile, verabschiedete sich von Karl, klopfe ihm manchmal auf die Wange, wenn er mit seinem Reiten besonders zufrieden gewesen war und verschwand, ohne vor großer Eile mit Karl auch nur gemeinsam durch die Tür herauszugehn. Karl nahm dann den Professor mit ins Automobil und sie fuhren zu ihrer Englischstunde meist auf Umwegen, denn bei der Fahrt durch das Gedränge der großen Straße, die eigentlich direkt von dem Hause des Onkels zur Reitschule führte, wäre zuviel Zeit verloren gegangen. Im übrigen hörte wenigstens diese Begleitung des Eng- lischprofessors bald auf, denn Karl der sich Vorwürfe machte, den müden Mann nutzlos in die Reitschule zu bemühn, zumal die englische Verständigung mit Mak eine sehr einfache war, bat den Onkel den Professor von dieser Pflicht zu entheben. Nach einiger Überlegung gab der Onkel dieser Bitte auch nach.","The English professor was already waiting for him at the riding school, where his uncle's high-rising automobile dropped him off, while Mak always came later. But he could also come later without worrying, because the actual lively riding only started when he was there. Didn't the horses rear up from their half-sleep when he entered, didn't the crack of the whip louder across the room, didn't individuals suddenly appear in the surrounding gallery, spectators, grooms, riding students or whatever else they might be? But Karl used the time before Mak's arrival to do a little, if only the most primitive, preliminary exercises in horseback riding. There was a tall man there, who reached up onto the highest horseback with his arm barely raised and who gave Karl these lessons, which always lasted barely a quarter of an hour. The successes that Karl had here were not great and he was able to continuously acquire many English wails, which he let out breathlessly while learning to his English professor, who was always leaning on the same doorpost, usually very sleep-deprived. But almost all dissatisfaction with riding stopped when Mak came. The tall man was sent away and soon all you could hear in the still semi-dark room was the hooves of the galloping horses and you could hardly see anything but Mak's raised arm, with which he gave Karl a command. After half an hour of such pleasure as sleep ebbing, a halt was made, Mak was in a great hurry, said goodbye to Karl, sometimes slapped him on the cheek when he had been particularly pleased with his riding, and left without much haste with Karl even walking out the door together. Karl then took the professor with him in the car and they usually drove to their English lesson in a roundabout way, because driving through the crowded main street, which actually led directly from the uncle's house to the riding school, would have lost too much time. Besides, at least this accompaniment of the English professor soon ceased, for Karl, who reproached himself for needlessly bothering the tired man to the riding school, especially since English communication with Mak was very easy, asked the uncle to relieve the professor of this duty remove. After some deliberation, the uncle gave in to this request.","Waiting for him at the riding school, where the lofty automobile of his uncle dropped him, would be his English teacher, while Mak invariably only turned up later. He could afford to, because the truly animated riding would only begin once he was there. Didn’t the horses leap out of their doze on his entry, didn’t the whip crack more percussively through the arena, while the surrounding gallery was suddenly populated by various spectators, grooms, riding pupils, or whoever they were? Karl used the time before Mack’s arrival for some very basic riding exercises. There was a long tall man who could reach the highest horseback almost without raising his arm, and he always gave Karl that fifteen-minute preparation. Karl was not overly successful with him, a pretext for learning English lamentations, which he kept uttering in a breathless way during this tuition to his English teacher, who was always leaning on the same doorpost, generally dog-tired. But almost all his frustration with riding would disappear when Mak arrived. The tall man was dismissed, and soon nothing would be heard in the still half-dark hall except the sound of galloping horses, and little was seen except Mak’s raised arm as he gave Karl some order. After a delightful half an hour of this had passed almost like sleep they called a halt, Mak was in a tearing rush, he said goodbye to Karl patting him on the cheek if he were particularly pleased with his performance, and disappeared, in too much of a hurry even to go out through the door with Karl. Karl then took the teacher in his car, and they drove to their English lesson, usually by some roundabout way, because the big street, which actually led straight from the uncle’s house to the riding school, was so choked with traffic that they would have lost too much time. He didn’t have the company of the English teacher for very much longer, because Karl reproached himself for dragging the tired man along to riding school to no purpose, as the English communication with Mak was on a very simple level, and so he asked his uncle to relieve the teacher of this duty. After some thought, the uncle agreed.","On being dropped off by his uncle’s towering automobile at the riding school, the English teacher would already be waiting for him, whereas Mak always came late. But he didn’t have to worry about getting there late, for the lively riding began only after he arrived. When he entered, didn’t the horses rear up from their half-sleep; didn’t the whip crack more loudly through the hall; and didn’t a number of individuals, spectators, grooms, riding students, or whoever they might be suddenly appear on the surrounding gallery? Karl, however, used the time before Mak’s arrival to practice at least a few riding exercises, elementary though they were. A tall man, who could almost reach the withers of the biggest horses without raising his arm, gave Karl riding lessons that always only lasted barely a quarter of an hour. Karl met with only modest success and was able to learn English cries of distress, which he shouted out breathlessly to his English teacher, who always leaned against the same doorpost, often greatly in need of sleep. But once Mak arrived, almost all of his dissatisfaction with riding disappeared. The tall man was dismissed, and soon all one could hear in the still half-dark hall were the galloping horses’ hooves, and all one could see was the raised arm with which Mak gave orders to Karl. After engaging in such pleasure for half an hour, which passed by as if in one’s sleep, they stopped; in a great rush Mak said goodbye, tapped Karl on the cheek if he was especially satisfied with his riding, and in his haste disappeared without even waiting to accompany Karl through the door. Karl then took the teacher along in the automobile, and they drove to their English lesson, mostly via detours, since they would have lost too much time going through the bustle of the main street, which led directly from Uncle’s house to the riding school. In any case the English teacher soon ceased to accompany him, since Karl, who reproached himself for unnecessarily dragging that weary man out to the riding school, asked his uncle to relieve the teacher of this duty, especially since it was so easy to communicate with Mak in English. After some reflection his uncle also granted this request."
"Vor der Türe entstand ein Lärmen, man hörte Rufe und es war sogar, als werde jemand brutal gegen die Tür gestoßen. Ein Matrose trat ein, etwas verwildert, und hatte eine Mädchenschürze umgebunden. „Es sind Leu- te draußen"", rief er und stieß einmal mit den Elbogen herum, als sei er noch im Gedränge. Endlich fand er seine Besinnung und wollte vor dem Kapitän salutieren, da bemerkte er die Mädchenschürze, riß sie herunter, warf sie zu Boden und rief: „Das ist ja ekelhaf, da haben sie mir eine Mädchenschürze umgebunden."" Dann aber klappte er die Hacken zusammen und salutierte. Jemand versuchte zu lachen, aber der Kapitän sagte streng: „Das nenne ich eine gute Laune. Wer ist denn draußen?"" „Es sind meine Zeugen"", sagte Schubal vortretend, „ich bitte ergebenst um Entschuldigung für ihr unpassendes Be- nehmen. Wenn die Leute die Seefahrt hinter sich haben, sind sie manchmal wie toll."" – „Rufen Sie sie sofort her- ein"", befahl der Kapitän und gleich sich zum Senator umwendend sagte er verbindlich, aber rasch: „Haben Sie jetzt die Güte, verehrter Herr Senator, mit Ihrem Herrn Neffen diesem Matrosen zu folgen, der Sie ins Boot bringen wird. Ich muß wohl nicht erst sagen, welches Vergnügen und welche Ehre mir das persönliche Be- kanntwerden mit Ihnen, Herr Senator, bereitet hat. Ich wünsche mir nur bald Gelegenheit zu haben, mit Ihnen, Herr Senator, unser unterbrochenes Gespräch über die amerikanischen Flottenverhältnisse wieder einmal auf- nehmen zu können und dann vielleicht neuerdings auf so angenehme Weise wie heute unterbrochen zu wer- den."" „Vorläufig genügt mir dieser eine Neffe"", sagte der Onkel lachend. „Und nun nehmen Sie meinen be- sten Dank für Ihre Liebenswürdigkeit und leben Sie wohl. Es wäre übrigens gar nicht so unmöglich, daß wir"" – er drückte Karl herzlich an sich – „bei unserer nächsten Europareise vielleicht für längere Zeit zusam- menkommen könnten."" „Es würde mich herzlich freu- en"", sagte der Kapitän. Die beiden Herren schüttelten einander die Hände, Karl konnte nur noch stumm und flüchtig seine Hand dem Kapitän reichen, denn dieser war bereits von den vielleicht fünfzehn Leuten in An- spruch genommen welche unter Führung Schubals zwar etwas betroffen aber doch sehr laut einzogen. Der Ma- trose bat den Senator vorausgehn zu dürfen und teilte dann die Menge für ihn und Karl, die leicht zwischen den sich verbeugenden Leuten durchkamen. Es schien daß diese im übrigen gutmütigen Leute den Streit Schu- bals mit dem Heizer als einen Spaß auffaßten, dessen Lächerlichkeit nicht einmal vor dem Kapitän auföre. Karl bemerkte unter ihnen auch das Küchenmädchen Line, welche, ihm lustig zuzwinkernd, die vom Matro- sen hingeworfene Schürze umband, denn es war die ih- rige.","There was a noise in front of the door, shouts were heard and it was even as if someone was being brutally pushed against the door. A sailor came in, a bit wild, wearing a girl's apron. ""There are people outside,"" he cried, and kicked his elbows around as if he were still in the crowd. Finally he recovered his senses and was about to salute the captain when he noticed the girl's apron, tore it off, and threw it on the ground and yelled: ""That's disgusting, they put a girl's apron on me."" But then he clicked his heels together and saluted. Someone tried to laugh, but the captain said sternly, ""That's what I call a good mood. Who's outside?"" ""They're my witnesses,"" said Schubal, stepping forward, ""I sincerely apologize for your inappropriate behavior. When the people have seafaring behind them, they are sometimes crazy."" - ""Call them in immediately,"" ordered the captain and immediately turning to the senator he said obligingly but quickly: ""Now have the goodness honorable senator, to follow with your nephew this sailor who will take you on board. I don't think I need to say what a pleasure and what an honor it was to get to know you personally, Senator. I wish I could soon have the opportunity to resume our interrupted conversation about American naval conditions with you, Senator, and then perhaps be interrupted again in a pleasant way like today."" ""For the time being, that's enough for me that one nephew,"" said the uncle, laughing. ""And now accept my thanks for your kindness and farewell. Incidentally, it wouldn't be so impossible that we"" - he gave Karl a warm hug - ""maybe get together for a longer time on our next trip to Europe."" ""I would be very happy,"" said the captain. The two gentlemen shook hands, Karl could only offer his hand to the captain silently and fleetingly, because he was already occupied by the maybe fifteen people under the leadership of Schubal, a little concerned but very noisy, moved in. The sailor asked permission to go ahead of the senator and then divided the crowd for him and Karl, who easily got through the bowing people.It seemed that these otherwise good-natured people the Schubal's quarrel with the stoker as a joke, the ridiculousness of which did not stop even before the captain Karl noticed among them the kitchen maid Line, who, with a merry wink, tied on the apron thrown down by the sailor, because it was ih - rig.","Outside the door, there was a commotion, shouting, and it even seemed as though someone was being viciously pushed against it. A rather wild-looking sailor came in, wearing a girl’s apron. ‘There’s people outside,’ he said, pumping his elbows as though still in the crowd. Finally he came to his senses, and was about to salute the captain, when he noticed his girl’s apron, tore it off, threw it on the ground, and said: ‘That’s disgusting, they’ve tied a girl’s apron on me.’ Then he clicked his heels together and saluted. Someone stifled a laugh, but the captain said sternly: ‘Enough of these high jinks. Who is it who’s outside?’ ‘They are my witnesses,’ said Schubal stepping forward, ‘I’d like to apologize for their behaviour. At the end of a long sea voyage, they sometimes get a little unruly.’ ‘Call them in right away,’ ordered the captain, and turning quickly to the Senator, he said kindly but briskly: ‘Would you be so kind now, my dear Senator, as to take your nephew and follow the sailor who will escort you to your boat? I can’t say what happiness and honour your personal acquaintance has brought me. I only wish I may have another opportunity soon of resuming our discussion of the American Navy, and then perhaps to be interrupted as pleasantly as we were today.’ ‘One nephew’s enough for me for the moment,’ said the uncle laughing. ‘And now please accept my thanks for your kindness, and farewell. It’s by no means out of the question that we’ – he pressed Karl affectionately to himself – ‘might spend a little longer in your company on the occasion of our next visit to Europe.’ ‘I should be delighted,’ said the captain. The two gentlemen shook hands, Karl took the captain’s hand quickly and silently because he was then distracted by about fifteen people who had come into the office, a little chastened but very noisily still, under Schubal’s leadership. The sailor asked the Senator to let him go first, and cleared a way for him and Karl, who passed quite easily through the crowd of bowing people. It seemed these cheerful souls thought the quarrel between Schubal and the stoker was a joke that even the captain was being permitted to share. Among them Karl spotted Line the Kitchen maid, who winked merrily at him as she tied on the apron which the sailor had thrown down, because it was hers.","A commotion began outside the door; one could hear shouts, and it even seemed as if someone was being thrust violently against the door. A sailor entered looking rather disheveled, with a maid’s apron tied around his waist. “There are a few people outside,” he cried, thrusting out his elbows as though he were still surrounded by a crowd. Finally he regained his composure and was about to salute the captain when he noticed the servant’s apron, tore it off, threw it on the ground, and shouted: “That’s revolting, they’ve tied a maid’s apron around me.” Then he clicked his heels, however, and saluted. Someone made an attempt to laugh, but the captain said severely: “Somebody appears to be in a good mood! So who’s outside?” “They’re my witnesses,” said Schubal, stepping forward. “I most humbly beseech you to excuse their unseemly conduct. Once the men have the voyage behind them they sometimes start acting like madmen.” “Call them in,” the captain commanded, and turning immediately to the senator, he said quickly but courteously: “Mr. Senator, could you be so kind as to follow this sailor, who’ll escort you to the boat? And it goes without saying, Mr. Senator, that it was a great pleasure and an honor for me to make your acquaintance. I can only hope that I shall soon get another chance to resume our interrupted conversation about the state of the American fleet, and maybe we can ensure that next time too it’ll be interrupted in an equally pleasant manner.” “Well, one nephew seems quite enough for now,” said Karl’s uncle, laughing. “Please accept my most heart felt thanks for the kindness you’ve shown, and now I should like to bid you farewell. By the way, it’s not inconceivable”—he pressed Karl to his chest affectionately—“that we could spend more time together on our next voyage to Europe.” “I should be only too delighted,” said the captain. The two gentlemen shook hands; Karl had to be satisfied with holding out his hand briefly for the captain without being able to say a word, since the latter was already preoccupied with the roughly fifteen people led by Schubal, who entered somewhat diffidently yet also very noisily. After asking the senator for permission to go ahead, the sailor divided the crowd for the senator and Karl, who made their way easily through the bowing crowd. These otherwise good-natured people seemed to regard Schubal’s fight with the stoker as nothing more than a joke, which lost none of its hilarity even in the presence of the captain. Among them Karl noticed the kitchen maid Line, who winked at him cheerfully as she tied on the apron that had been cast aside by the sailor, for it was indeed hers."
"In den ersten Tagen, an denen selbstverständlich zwi- schen Karl und dem Onkel häufigere Aussprachen statt- gefunden hatten, hatte Karl auch erzählt, daß er zu hause wenig zwar, aber gern Klavier gespielt habe, was er aller- dings lediglich mit den Anfangskenntnissen hatte be- streiten können, die ihm die Mutter beigebracht hatte. Karl war sich dessen wohl bewußt, daß eine solche Er- zählung gleichzeitig die Bitte um ein Klavier war, aber er hatte sich schon genügend umgesehn, um zu wissen, daß der Onkel auf keine Weise zu sparen brauchte. Trotz- dem wurde ihm diese Bitte nicht gleich gewährt, aber etwa acht Tage später sagte der Onkel fast in der Form eines widerwilligen Eingeständnisses, das Klavier sei eben angelangt und Karl könne, wenn er wolle den Transport überwachen. Das war allerdings eine leichte Arbeit, aber dabei nicht einmal viel leichter als der Transport selbst, denn im Haus war ein eigener Möbel- aufzug, in welchem ohne Gedränge ein ganzer Möbel- wagen Platz finden konnte und in diesem Aufzug schwebte auch das Piano zu Karls Zimmer hinauf. Karl selbst hätte zwar in dem gleichen Aufzug mit dem Piano und den Transportarbeitern fahren können, aber da gleich daneben ein Personenaufzug zur Benützung frei- stand, fuhr er in diesem, hielt sich mittelst eines Hebels stets in gleicher Höhe mit dem andern Aufzug und be- trachtete unverwandt durch die Glaswände das schöne Instrument das jetzt sein Eigentum war. Als er es in seinem Zimmer hatte und die ersten Töne anschlug, be- kam er eine so närrische Freude, daß er statt weiterzu- spielen aufsprang und aus einiger Entfernung die Hände in den Hüfen das Klavier lieber anstaunte. Auch die Akustik des Zimmers war ausgezeichnet und sie trug dazu bei sein anfängliches kleines Unbehagen, in einem Eisenhause zu wohnen, gänzlich verschwinden zu las- sen. Tatsächlich merkte man auch im Zimmer, so eisen- mäßig das Gebäude von außen erschien, von eisernen Baubestandteilen nicht das geringste und niemand hätte auch nur eine Kleinigkeit in der Einrichtung aufzeigen können, welche die vollständigste Gemütlichkeit irgend- wie gestört hätte. Karl erhofe in der ersten Zeit viel von seinem Klavierspiel und schämte sich nicht wenigstens vor dem Einschlafen an die Möglichkeit einer unmittel- baren Beeinflussung der amerikanischen Verhältnisse durch dieses Klavierspiel zu denken. Es klang ja aller- dings sonderbar, wenn er vor den in die lärmerfüllte Luf geöffneten Fenstern ein altes Soldatenlied seiner Heimat spielte, das die Soldaten am Abend, wenn sie in den Kasernenfenstern liegen und auf den finstern Platz hinausschauen, von Fenster zu Fenster einander zusingen – aber sah er dann auf die Straße, so war sie unverändert und nur ein kleines Stück eines großen Kreislaufes, das man nicht an und für sich anhalten konnte, ohne alle Kräfe zu kennen, die in der Runde wirkten. Der Onkel duldete das Klavierspiel, sagte auch nichts dagegen, zumal Karl sich auch ohne Mahnung nur selten das Vergnügen des Spieles gönnte, ja er brachte Karl sogar Noten amerikanischer Märsche und natürlich auch der Nationalhymne, aber allein aus der Freude an der Musik war es wohl nicht zu erklären, als er eines Tages ohne allen Scherz Karl fragte, ob er nicht auch das Spiel auf der Geige oder auf dem Waldhorn lernen wolle.","During the first few days, when Karl and his uncle naturally talked more frequently, Karl had also said that he didn't play the piano much at home, but he liked it, although he only had the rudimentary knowledge of it be able to deny that his mother had taught him. Karl was well aware that such a story was also a request for a piano, but he had already looked around enough to know that his uncle did not need to economize in any way. Nevertheless, this request was not immediately granted, but about eight days later the uncle said, almost in the form of a reluctant admission, that the piano had just arrived and that Karl could supervise the transport if he wished. That was easy work, but not even much easier than the transport itself, because the house had its own furniture elevator, in which a whole furniture van could find space without crowding, and the piano also floated to Karl's in this elevator room up. Karl himself could have taken the same elevator with the piano and the transport workers, but since there was a passenger elevator right next to it that could be used, he rode it, using a lever to keep himself at the same height as the other elevator and looked steadily through the glass walls for the beautiful instrument that was now his property. When he had it in his room and struck the first notes, he was so silly that instead of continuing to play he jumped up and from a distance, his hands on his hips, preferred to marvel at the piano. The acoustics of the room were also excellent and they helped to make his initial slight uneasiness about living in an iron house completely disappear. In fact, no matter how iron the building looked from the outside, you didn't notice the slightest bit of iron components in the room, and no one could have pointed out even a small detail in the furnishings that would have disturbed the most complete comfort in any way. Karl hoped a lot from his piano playing at first and was not ashamed to think at least before falling asleep of the possibility that this piano playing would have a direct influence on American conditions. It certainly sounded strange when he played an old soldier's song from his homeland in front of the open windows into the noisy air, which the soldiers sing to one another from window to window in the evening when they lie in the barracks windows and look out over the dark square - but if he then looked at the street, it was unchanged and only a small part of a great cycle that one could not actually stop without knowing all the forces that were at work in the round. The uncle tolerated playing the piano, didn't say anything against it, especially since Karl rarely allowed himself the pleasure of playing, even without a reminder, he even gave Karl notes of American marches and of course the national anthem, but it was just for the joy of music not to be explained when one day he asked Karl without any jokes if he would like to learn to play the violin or the French horn.","In the first few days, there were of course frequent conversations between Karl and his uncle, and Karl had mentioned that he had played the piano at home, not much but with enjoyment, although he only knew the basics, which his mother had taught him. Karl was well aware that to mention this was tantamount to asking for a piano, but he had already seen enough to know that his uncle didn’t need to economize. Even so, his wish was not immediately fulfilled, and it wasn’t till a week later that the uncle said, and it sounded like a reluctant admission, that the piano had arrived and if Karl wanted to he could supervise its move up to his room. It was an undemanding job, but really no more demanding than the moving itself, because the building had its very own service lift, in which a whole removal van might have fitted with ease, and this lift carried the piano up to Karl’s room. Karl could have gone on the same lift as the piano and the removal men, but since there was an ordinary lift just next to the other, standing empty, he took that, using a lever to remain constantly at the same level as the other lift, and looking through the glass walls at the beautiful instrument that was now his own. When it was installed in his room, and he played a few notes on it, he was seized with such a crazy joy that instead of continuing to play he leaped up and gazed at it from a distance, standing with his hands on his hips. The acoustics of the room were excellent, and that helped to take away his initial unease at living in an iron house. In fact, though the building might look very iron from outside, inside it one had not the slightest sense of its iron construction, and no one could have pointed to any features of the decor that were anything other than completely cosy. In the early days, Karl had high hopes of his piano playing, and while lying in bed, at any rate, he thought it might have a direct effect upon his American environment. But it did sound very peculiar when, with the windows letting in the noisy air from outside, he played an old ballad from his homeland, which the soldiers sing to each other in the evenings as they lean out through the barrack windows gazing at the dark square outside – but then, when he looked out on to the street, it was just the same, a tiny piece, no more, of a gigantic circulatory system that couldn’t be arrested without understanding all the forces operating on its totality. The uncle put up with his piano playing and made no objection to it, especially as, quite unprompted, Karl only rarely allowed himself the pleasure of it. Yes, he even brought Karl the scores of American marches and of course of the national anthem, too, but it couldn’t just have been love of music that made him one day ask Karl perfectly seriously if he wouldn’t care to learn the violin or the French horn as well.","In the first few days, when naturally there were frequent exchanges between Karl and his uncle, he had said that he had played on the piano at home, only a little but with considerable pleasure, though he had had to make do with the beginner’s skills his mother had taught him. Karl was well aware that in telling this story he was in effect requesting a piano, but he had taken a sufficiently good look around to know that his uncle had no need to economize. Still, his request was not granted at once, but about eight days later his uncle announced, almost reluctantly, that the piano had just arrived and that, if Karl wished, he could supervise the move. That was certainly easy work, though scarcely any easier than the actual move, since the building had a special furniture elevator that could easily accommodate an entire furniture vehicle, and it was in this elevator that the piano glided up to Karl’s room. Karl could have taken the same goods elevator as the piano and the workers, but since the passenger elevator right beside it happened to be free, he chose that one instead, keeping himself at the same height as the other elevator with the help of a lever and constantly looking through the glass panels of the elevator at the beautiful instrument that now belonged to him. When it stood in his room and he struck the first keys, he felt such wild joy that, rather than continuing to play, he jumped up, preferring to stand some distance away, hands on his hips, gazing at the piano. Besides, the acoustics in the room were splendid, and that helped him overcome the slight discomfort he had initially felt on discovering that he was living in a building made of steel. In reality, though, no matter how steel-like the building seemed from the outside, in the actual room there was no sign of the steel components employed in its construction, and no one could have pointed out the tiniest item in the interior design that would have in any way spoiled the overall effect of complete comfort and ease. In his first days there Karl had hoped to accomplish a great deal through his piano playing and was not ashamed—at least just before falling asleep—to imagine that his playing might directly affect his situation in America. It certainly sounded strange whenever he stood in front of windows opening out onto the noisy street, playing an old soldier’s song from his homeland, which the soldiers, who used to lie by the barrack windows at night looking down at the dark square, would sing from one window to the next—but then when he looked down on the street he could see that it had not changed at all and merely formed one small part of a great cycle that one could not actually bring to a halt unless one were aware of all of the forces operating in the circle. His uncle tolerated his playing , did not even say anything about it, especially since, even without being admonished, Karl only rarely granted himself the pleasure of playing; he even brought Karl the scores of American marches and naturally also of the national anthem, but his love of music was surely not the only reason why one day he asked Karl, by no means in jest, whether he might not also wish to learn the violin or the French horn."
"In solchen Gedanken schlief Karl ein und nur im er- sten Halbschlaf störte ihn noch ein gewaltiges Seufzen Bruneldas, die scheinbar von schweren Träumen geplagt sich auf ihrem Lager wälzte.","With such thoughts Karl fell asleep and only when he was half asleep was he disturbed by a mighty sigh of Brunelda, who was tossing and turning on her bed, apparently plagued by bad dreams.","Thinking such thoughts, Karl fell asleep and as he was drifting off, he was disturbed once more by a vast sigh from Brunelda who, evidently plagued by troubling dreams, tossed and turned on her bed.","Immersed in such thoughts, Karl fell asleep, and his initially light sleep was disturbed only by the mighty sighing of Brunelda, who, evidently tormented by heavy dreams, tossed and turned on her bed."
"Karl schwang sich mit beiden Füßen zugleich über die Klavierbank und öffnete die Tür. Er sah dort Mack in einem großen Himmelbett halb liegend sitzen, die Bett- decke war lose über die Beine geworfen. Der Baldachin aus blauer Seide war die einzige ein wenig mädchenhafe Pracht des sonst einfachen, aus schwerem Holz eckig gezimmerten Bettes. Auf dem Nachttischchen brannte nur eine Kerze, aber die Bettwäsche und Macks Hemd waren so weiß, daß das auf sie fallende Kerzenlicht in fast blendendem Widerschein von ihnen strahlte; auch der Baldachin leuchtete wenigstens am Rande mit seiner leicht gewellten, nicht ganz fest gespannten Seide. Gleich hinter Mack versank aber das Bett und alles in vollstän- digem Dunkel. Klara lehnte sich an den Bettpfosten und hatte nur noch Augen für Mack.","Karl swung himself over the piano bench with both feet at the same time and opened the door. There he saw Mack sitting half-reclined in a large four-poster bed, the covers thrown loosely over his legs. The canopy of blue silk was the only slightly girlish splendor of the otherwise simple, angular bed made of heavy wood. Only one candle burned on the bedside table, but the sheets and Mack's shirt were so white that the candlelight falling on them shone off them in almost blinding reflections; the canopy also shone, at least at the edge, with its slightly wavy, not quite tightly stretched silk. Right behind Mack, however, the bed sank and everything went into complete darkness. Klara leaned against the bedpost and only had eyes for Mack.","Karl swung himself off the piano stool and opened the door. He saw Mack sprawling on a large four-poster bed, with the coverlet draped loosely over his legs. The blue silk canopy was the only thing remotely feminine about the angular, simple, heavy bed. There was a single candle burning on the bedside table, but the bedlinen and Mack’s shirt were so white that its light reflected off them in a dazzle; even the edges of the canopy gleamed with its slightly ruched, not quite stretched silk. Behind Mack the bed and everything else was lost in complete darkness. Klara leaned against the bedpost, and only had eyes for Mack.","Using both legs simultaneously, Karl swung himself over the piano bench and opened the door. He saw Mack seated, half reclining, on a large four-poster bed, the quilt loosely thrown over his legs. The sole, and rather schoolgirlish, adornment on the otherwise very simple bed, which was roughly hewn from heavy timber, consisted of a canopy made of blue silk. There was only one candle burning, but the bedclothes and Mack’s nightshirt were so white that the reflected candlelight falling on them was almost blinding; even the canopy, with its slightly billowing and not quite taut silk drapery, shone, at least at the edges. But behind Mack the bed and all else sank into complete darkness. Klara, leaning against the bedpost, now had eyes only for Mack."
"„Ich sage das"", fuhr die Oberköchin fort, „damit Du jetzt unbeirrt antwortest, was Du übrigens wahrschein- lich auch sonst getan hättest, wie ich Dich zu kennen glaube.""","""I'm saying that,"" continued the head cook, ""so that you can now answer undeterred, which, by the way, you probably would have done otherwise, as I think I know you.""","‘I say as much,’ continued the Head Cook, ‘so that you may be quite candid in your replies, which as I know you, you would probably have been anyway.’","“I’m telling this to you,” the head cook continued, “so that you can answer forthrightly, as you would have done anyhow, from what I know of you.”"
"„Nein, ich sehe noch immer nichts"", sagte Karl und dachte daran, daß er Robinson ohne seinen Willen nun tatsächlich entlastet habe, denn Bruneldas unerträgliche Launen wurden nun an ihm ausgelassen.","""No, I still don't see anything,"" said Karl, remembering that he had actually exonerated Robinson without his will, because Brunelda's intolerable whims were now being taken out on him.","‘No, I still can’t see anything,’ said Karl, and thought that, even without wanting to, he had indeed relieved Robinson, because Brunelda’s insufferable moods were now being taken out on him.","“No, I still can’t see anything,” said Karl, and he thought of how he had quite inadvertently relieved Robinson of a burden, for he himself had now become the target of Brunelda’s insufferable moods."
"Auf dem Gange mußten sie lange hin und her gehn und besonders der Franzose, der sich in Karl eingehängt hatte, schimpfe ununterbrochen, drohte den Wirt, wenn er sich vorwagen sollte, niederzuboxen und es schien eine Vorbereitung dazu zu sein, daß er die geball- ten Fäuste rasend an einander rieb. Endlich kam ein un- schuldiger kleiner Junge, der sich strecken mußte als er dem Franzosen die Kaffeekanne reichte. Leider war nur eine Kanne vorhanden und man konnte dem Jungen nicht begreiflich machen, daß noch Gläser erwünscht wären. So konnte immer nur einer trinken und die zwei andern standen vor ihm und warteten. Karl hatte keine Lust zu trinken, wollte aber die andern nicht kränken und stand also, wenn er an der Reihe war untätig da, die Kanne an den Lippen.","They had to walk back and forth in the corridor for a long time, and the Frenchman in particular, who had attached himself to Karl, kept scolding, threatened to punch the landlord if he dared to advance, and it seemed to be a preparation for him to throw the ten fists frantically rubbing together. Finally an innocent little boy came, who had to stretch as he handed the coffee pot to the Frenchman. Unfortunately, there was only one pot and the boy couldn't be made to understand that glasses were wanted. So only one could drink at a time and the other two stood in front of him and waited. Karl didn't feel like drinking, but didn't want to offend the others, so when it was his turn he stood there idly, the pot to his lips.","They had to walk up and down the corridor for a long time, and the Frenchman in particular, who had linked arms with Karl, was swearing incessantly, threatening to punch the landlord to the ground if he should show his face, a moment he seemed to be preparing for by furiously grating his fists together. At last an innocent little boy came along, who had to get up on tiptoe to hand the Frenchman the coffee can. Unfortunately there was only that one can available, and the boy couldn’t be made to understand that glasses were wanted as well. So only one person could drink at a time, and the other two had to stand and watch. Karl didn’t want any, but not wanting to offend the others, he raised the can to his lips when it was his turn, but didn’t drink from it.","In the corridor they had to go back and forth for some time, and especially the Frenchman, who had taken Karl’s arm, complained continually, threatening to knock down the innkeeper should he dare appear and, as if preparing to do so, he started to rub his clenched fists furiously. At last an innocent little boy came along and had to stretch up tall in order to hand the Frenchman the coffeepot. Unfortunately, there seemed to be only one coffeepot available, and it was impossible to get the boy to understand that they would like some glasses too. So only one person at a time could drink while the others stood beside him, each awaiting his turn. Although Karl had no desire to drink, he did not wish to hurt the feelings of the other two, and so, when his turn came, he simply stood motionless, holding the coffeepot to his lips."
"Sofort setzte sich Karl aufrecht, dieses Liegen war schon unerträglich geworden. Um ein wenig Bewegung zu machen, gieng er zur Tür und sah auf den Gang hinaus. War dort aber eine Finsternis! Er war froh, als er die Tür zugemacht und abgesperrt hatte, und wieder bei seinem Tisch im Schein der Kerze stand. Sein Entschluß war, nicht länger in diesem Haus zu bleiben, sondern hinunter zu Herrn Pollunder zu gehn, ihm offen zu sa- gen, wie ihn Klara behandelt hatte – am Eingeständnis seiner Niederlage lag ihm gar nichts – und mit dieser wohl genügenden Begründung um die Erlaubnis zu bit- ten, nachhause fahren oder gehn zu dürfen. Sollte Herr Pollunder etwas gegen diese sofortige Heimkehr einzu- wenden haben, dann wollte ihn Karl wenigstens bitten, ihn durch einen Diener zum nächsten Hotel führen zu lassen. In dieser Weise, wie sie Karl plante gieng man zwar sonst in der Regel nicht mit freundlichen Gastge- bern um, aber noch seltener gieng man mit einem Gaste derartig um wie es Klara getan hatte. Sie hatte sogar noch ihr Versprechen, dem Herrn Pollunder von der Rauferei vorläufig nichts zu sagen, für eine Freundlich- keit gehalten, das war aber schon himmelschreiend. Ja war denn Karl zu einem Ringkampf eingeladen worden, so daß es für ihn beschämend gewesen wäre, von einem Mädchen geworfen zu werden, das wahrscheinlich den größten Teil ihres Lebens mit dem Lernen von Ring- kämpferkniffen verbracht hatte. Am Ende hatte sie gar von Mack Unterricht bekommen. Mochte sie ihm nur alles erzählen, der war sicher einsichtig, das wußte Karl, trotzdem er niemals Gelegenheit gehabt hatte, das im einzelnen zu erfahren. Karl wußte aber auch, daß wenn Mack ihn unterrichten würde, er noch viel größere Fort- schritte als Klara machen würde; dann käme er eines Tages wieder hierher, höchstwahrscheinlich uneingela- den, untersuchte natürlich zuerst die Örtlichkeit, deren genaue Kenntnis ein großer Vorteil Klaras gewesen war, packte dann diese gleiche Klara und klopfe mit ihr das gleiche Kanapee aus, auf das sie ihn heute geworfen hatte.","Karl immediately sat up, lying down had become unbearable. To exercise a little, he went to the door and looked out into the corridor. But there was darkness! He was glad when he closed and locked the door and was back at his table in the candlelight. His decision was not to stay in this house any longer, but to go down to Mr. Pollunder, to tell him openly how Klara had treated him - he didn't care at all about admitting his defeat - and with this probably sufficient reason for the Asking permission to drive or walk home. If Herr Pollunder had any objections to this immediate return, Karl would at least ask him to let a servant take him to the nearest hotel. One did not usually treat friendly hosts in the way Karl planned, but it was even rarer to treat a guest in the way Klara had done. She had even taken her promise not to tell Herr Pollunder about the fight for the time being as a courtesy, but that was outrageous. After all, Karl had been invited to a wrestling match, so it would have been embarrassing for him to be thrown by a girl who had probably spent most of her life learning wrestling tricks. In the end she even got lessons from Mack. If she only wanted to tell him everything, Karl knew that he would certainly understand, even though he had never had the opportunity to find out in detail. But Karl also knew that if Mack were to teach him, he would make even greater progress than Klara; then one day he would come back here, most likely uninvited, of course first examine the place, which exact knowledge had been a great advantage for Klara, then grabbed this same Klara and beat out the same settee with her that she had thrown him on today .","Straightaway Karl sat up, lying had become impossible for him. For a little exercise he went to the door and looked out into the passage. It was pitch-black out there! He felt relieved when he had shut the door and bolted it, and was back by his table in the candlelight. He had decided not to stay in the house any longer, but to go downstairs to Mr Pollunder, to tell him quite openly how Klara had treated him – he didn’t mind admitting his defeat – and with probably sufficient justification, ask for permission to drive or walk home. If Mr Pollunder should have any objection to his immediate return, then Karl would ask to be shown to the nearest hotel by a servant. This wasn’t how one normally behaved to a friendly host, but it was still more unusual for a guest to be treated as he had been by Klara. She had even thought her promise not to mention the fight to Mr Pollunder was doing him a favour, and that was shocking enough. Was it some kind of wrestling bout to which Karl had been invited, so that it would have been embarrassing for him to have been thrown by a girl who probably spent most of her waking hours learning wrestling holds? She had probably received tuition from Mack. Let her tell him everything, he would understand, Karl was sure of that, even though he’d not yet had an opportunity to try him. But Karl also knew that if Mack had given him coaching, he would have been a far better pupil than Klara; and one day he would come back here, most probably uninvited, he would first reconnoitre the area, local knowledge was a prime advantage of Klarl’s, and then he would grab that selfsame Klara, and dust that same sofa with her which she had laid him on today.","Karl immediately sat up straight; all that lying around had become quite intolerable. In order to move about a little, he went to the door and looked into the corridor. How dark it was out there! He was glad when he had shut and locked the door and could be at his table in the candlelight again. He resolved not to stay in this house any longer and to go downstairs to Mr. Pollunder and tell him openly how Klara had treated him—having to confess his defeat did not in the least disturb him—and, armed with this surely adequate explanation, ask for permission to drive or walk home. If Mr. Pollunder raised some objection to his going back at once, Karl would request that the servant at least take him to the nearest hotel. Although one did not generally treat amiable hosts as Karl intended to do, it was even rarer to treat a guest as Klara had done. She had even thought she was being kind in promising not to mention their scuffle to Mr. Pollunder for the time being, but that in itself was truly outrageous. Had Karl been asked to enter a wrestling contest in which it was shameful to be thrown about by a girl who had probably been learning wrestling tricks for most of her life? And besides, she had even been instructed by Mack. Well, she could go and tell him everything; he was certainly quite understanding, as Karl knew, although he had never really had a chance to experience this in person. Karl knew too that if Mack were to instruct him, he would make better progress than Klara; one day he would come back, probably without actually being invited, and after checking the layout first, of course, so as to acquire the precise knowledge that had given Klara such an advantage, use her to dust off the settee onto which she had just thrown him."
"Karl war frei und eilig eingetreten, wie er es sich hier im Hotel angewöhnt hatte, denn die Langsamkeit und Vorsicht, die bei Privatpersonen Höflichkeit bedeutet, hält man bei Lifjungen für Faulheit. Außerdem mußte man ihm auch nicht gleich beim Eintreten sein Schuldbe- wußtsein ansehn. Der Oberkellner hatte zwar flüchtig auf die sich öffnende Türe hingeblickt, war dann aber sofort zu seinem Kaffee und zu seiner Lektüre zurück- gekehrt, ohne sich weiter um Karl zu kümmern. Der Portier aber fühlte sich vielleicht durch Karls Anwesen- heit gestört, vielleicht hatte er irgend eine geheime Nachricht oder Bitte vorzutragen, jedenfalls sah er alle Augenblicke bös und mit steif geneigtem Kopf nach Karl hin, um sich dann wenn er offenbar seiner Absicht entsprechend mit Karls Blicken zusammengetroffen war, wieder dem Oberkellner zuzuwenden. Karl aber glaubte, es würde sich nicht gut ausnehmen, wenn er jetzt, da er nun schon einmal hier war, das Bureau wie- der verlassen würde, ohne vom Oberkellner den Befehl hiezu erhalten zu haben. Dieser aber studierte weiter das Verzeichnis und aß zwischendurch von einem Stück Ku- chen, von dem er hie und da, ohne im Lesen innezuhal- ten, den Zucker abschüttelte. Einmal fiel ein Blatt des Verzeichnisses zu Boden, der Portier machte nicht ein- mal einen Versuch es aufzuheben, er wußte daß er es nicht zustandebrächte, es war auch nicht nötig, denn Karl war schon zur Stelle und reichte das Blatt dem Oberkellner, der es ihm mit einer Handbewegung abnahm, als sei es von selbst vom Boden aufgeflogen. Die ganze kleine Dienstleistung hatte nichts genützt, denn der Portier hörte auch weiterhin mit seinen bösen Bücken nicht auf.","Karl had entered freely and hastily, as he had become accustomed to doing here in the hotel, for the slowness and caution which signifies politeness in private people is taken for laziness in Lifjungen. Besides, you didn't have to look at him with a sense of guilt as soon as you walked in. The head waiter had glanced at the opening door, but then immediately returned to his coffee and his book without paying any more attention to Karl. The porter, however, perhaps felt disturbed by Karl's presence, perhaps he had some secret message or request to convey, in any case he kept glancing at Karl angrily and with his head stiffly bowed, and then, if he was obviously in accordance with his intention, with Karl's eyes met to turn back to the head waiter. Karl, however, thought it would not look good if he were to leave the office again, now that he was here, without having received the order to do so from the head waiter. But he continued to study the list and in between ate a piece of cake, from which he shook off the sugar every now and then without pausing to read. Once a sheet of the list fell on the floor, the porter didn't even try to pick it up, he knew he couldn't manage it, it wasn't necessary either, because Karl was already there and handed the sheet to the head waiter, who took it took it from him with a wave of his hand, as if it had blown up from the ground by itself. The whole small service had been of no use, because the porter continued to glare at him.","Karl had made a swift and easy entrance, as he had become accustomed to doing in the hotel, because the slowness and circumspection that in other walks of life signify politeness are taken for laziness in lift-boys. Besides, he didn’t want his guilty conscience to be immediately apparent. The Head Waiter had glanced at the door, but immediately went back to his coffee and his reading, without taking any more notice of Karl. The porter, though, seemed to feel bothered by Karl’s presence, perhaps he had some confidential piece of news or favour to ask, at any rate he kept turning stiffly to send angry looks in Karl’s direction, and when these looks duly met Karl’s, he would look back at the Head Waiter again. But Karl thought it would make a bad impression if, having got here, he left the office again without being ordered to do so by the Head Waiter. He, though, carried on studying the inventory and eating a piece of cake from which he occasionally shook the sugar without stopping reading. Once a page of the inventory fell to the ground, the porter didn’t even make a move to pick it up, he knew that was entirely beyond him, nor was it necessary either as Karl had already done it, and passed the page back to the Head Waiter who took it from him with a motion of his hand that suggested it had flown back to him from the floor all by itself. The little service achieved nothing whatsoever, because the porter still carried on with his angry glances.","Karl had entered freely and in haste, as he was accustomed to do at the hotel, for the slowness and caution that is considered polite in private individuals is taken for laziness in lift boys. Besides, they mustn’t notice his sense of guilt the moment he entered. Though the head waiter glanced up briefly when the door opened, he returned to his coffee and reading, without paying any further heed to Karl. But the porter, perhaps feeling disturbed by Karl’s presence or perhaps having some kind of confidential news or request to report, gazed angrily at Karl the entire time, head stiffly inclined, and then, after having met Karl’s gaze—evidently on purpose—turned his head toward the head waiter. Karl, however, thought it would not look at all good if, after having come to the office, he were to leave now without receiving explicit orders from the head waiter to do so. The latter continued studying the ledger; now and then he took a piece of cake, shook off some sugar, and ate it without interrupting his reading. When a page from the ledger fell to the floor, the porter did not even attempt to pick it up; he realized that he was incapable of doing so; besides, it was also unnecessary since Karl had already reached the spot and passed the page to the head waiter, who merely reached out his hand and took it, as though it had flown up from the floor somehow all by itself. But that small good deed was of little avail, for the porter did not cease casting angry glances at him."
"„Unbedingt"", sagte der Student und senkte schon den Kopf zu seinen Büchern. Es schien, als hätte gar nicht er das Wort gesagt; wie von einer Stimme gesprochen, die tiefer war als jene des Studenten, klang es noch in Karls Ohren nach. Langsam ging er zum Vorhang, warf noch einen Blick auf den Studenten, der jetzt ganz unbeweg- lich, von der großen Finsternis umgeben, in seinem Lichtschein saß, und schlüpfe ins Zimmer. Die verein- ten Atemzüge der drei Schläfer empfingen ihn. Er suchte die Wand entlang das Kanapee, und als er es gefunden hatte, streckte er sich ruhig auf ihm aus, als sei es sein gewohntes Lager. Da ihm der Student, der den Dela- marche und die hiesigen Verhältnisse genau kannte und überdies ein gebildeter Mann war, geraten hatte, hier zu bleiben, hatte er vorläufig keine Bedenken. So hohe Ziele wie der Student hatte er nicht, wer weiß, ob es ihm sogar zu Hause gelungen wäre, das Studium zu Ende zu füh- ren, und wenn es zu Hause kaum möglich schien, so konnte niemand verlangen, daß er es hier im fremden Lande tue. Die Hoffnung aber, einen Posten zu finden, in dem er etwas leisten und für seine Leistungen aner- kannt werden konnte, war gewiß größer, wenn er vor- läufig die Dienerstelle bei Delamarche annahm und aus dieser Sicherheit heraus die günstige Gelegenheit abwar- tete. Es schienen sich ja in dieser Straße viele Büros mitt- leren und unteren Ranges zu befinden, die vielleicht im Falle des Bedarfes bei der Auswahl ihres Personals nicht gar zu wählerisch waren. Er wollte ja gern, wenn es sein mußte, Geschäfsdiener werden, aber schließlich war es ja gar nicht ausgeschlossen, daß er auch für reine Büroar- beit aufgenommen werden konnte und einstmals als Bü- robeamter an seinem Schreibtisch sitzen und ohne Sor- gen ein Weilchen lang aus dem offenen Fenster schauen würde wie jener Beamte, den er heute früh beim Durch- marsch durch die Höfe gesehen hatte. Beruhigend fiel ihm ein, als er die Augen schloß, daß er doch jung war und daß Delamarche ihn doch einmal freigeben würde; dieser Haushalt sah ja wirklich nicht danach aus, als sei er für die Ewigkeit gemacht. Wenn aber Karl einmal einen solchen Posten in einem Büro hätte, dann wollte er sich mit nichts anderem beschäfigen als mit seinen Bü- roarbeiten und nicht die Kräfe zersplittern wie der Stu- dent. Wenn es nötig sein sollte, wollte er auch die Nacht fürs Büro verwenden, was man ja im Beginn bei seiner geringen kaufmännischen Vorbildung sowieso von ihm verlangen würde. Er wollte nur an das Interesse des Ge- schäfes denken, dem er zu dienen hätte, und allen Ar- beiten sich unterziehen, selbst solchen, die andere Büro- beamte als ihrer nicht würdig zurückweisen würden. Die guten Vorsätze drängten sich in seinem Kopf, als stehe sein künfiger Chef vor dem Kanapee und lese sie von seinem Gesicht ab.","""Absolutely,"" said the student, already bowing his head to his books. It seemed as if he hadn't said the word at all; as if spoken by a voice that was deeper than the student's, it still rang in Karl's ears. Slowly he went to the curtain, took one last look at the student, who was now sitting quite motionless in its light, surrounded by the great darkness, and slipped into the room.The combined breaths of the three sleepers received him.He searched along the wall the settee, and when he had found it he quietly stretched out on it as if it were his usual bed, since the student, who knew Delamarche and local conditions well, and moreover was an educated man , had advised him to stay here, he had no qualms for the time being.He didn't have such lofty goals as the student, who knows whether he would have even managed to finish his studies at home, and if he could at home hardly seemed possible, so nobody could leave assume that he does it here in a foreign country. But the hope of finding a post in which he could achieve something and be recognized for his achievements was certainly greater if he temporarily accepted the position of servant at Delamarche and, with this certainty, waited for the right opportunity. There seemed to be a lot of middle and lower-ranking offices on this street, which perhaps weren't too choosy when it came to the selection of their staff, should the need arise. He would have liked to be a clerk if he had to, but in the end it wasn't out of the question that he could be taken on purely for office work and one day be able to sit at his desk as an office clerk and have no worries for a while would stare out the open window for a long time like the officer he had seen marching through the courtyards this morning. When he closed his eyes it occurred to him reassuringly that he was young after all and that Delamarche would set him free one day; this household really didn't look like it was made to last. But if Karl ever had such a post in an office, then he didn't want to occupy himself with anything other than his office work and not splinter his strength like the student. If necessary, he also wanted to use the night for the office, which would be expected of him at the beginning anyway, given his little commercial background. He wished only to think of the interests of the business he had to serve, and to undertake all labors, even such as other Bureau officials would dismiss as unworthy. The good resolutions crowded into his head as if his future boss were standing in front of the sofa and reading them off his face.","‘Definitely,’ said the student, and already his head was bent over his books. It was as though he hadn’t said the word at all; it echoed in Karl’s ears, as though it had come from a far deeper voice than the student’s. Slowly he made his way to the curtain, took a final look at the student, now sitting immobile in his pool of light, surrounded by all the darkness, and slipped into the room. The combined breathing of the three sleepers met him. He felt along the wall for the sofa, and when he had found it, he stretched out on it quietly, as though it was his regular bed. As the student, who knew Delamarche and circumstances here well, and was moreover a cultivated man, had counselled him to stay, he had no qualms for the moment. He didn’t have such lofty aims as the student, who could say if he would have managed to complete his studies if he’d stayed at home, and what barely seemed possible at home no one could demand that he did in a foreign land. But the hope of finding a job where he could do something and find recognition for it was certainly greater if he took the servant’s job with Delamarche, and from the security that offered, waited for a favourable opening. This street seemed to contain many small and medium-sized offices that might not be all that choosy when it came to filling a vacancy. He was happy to be a porter, if need be, but really it wasn’t out of the question that he might be chosen for actual office work and might one day sit as an office worker at his desk and look out of his open window with no worries for a while, just like that official he had seen in the morning while walking through the courtyards. It comforted him, even as he shut his eyes that he was still young, and that Delamarche would at some stage let him go: this household really didn’t give the impression of being made to last. But once Karl had got a job in an office, then he would occupy himself with nothing but his office work, and not fritter away his strength the way the student did. If need be, he would do night work at the office too, which would be asked of him anyway, in view of his limited business experience. He would think exclusively of the interest of the business where he was employed, and accept all manner of work, even what other employees saw as demeaning to them. Good resolutions crowded into his mind, as though his future boss were standing by his sofa, and could read them in his face.","“Absolutely,” said the student, bending his head over his books. It seemed as if he had not uttered that word but rather as if it had come from a voice deeper than the student’s; it continued to resound in Karl’s ears. Slowly he approached the curtain, cast another glance at the student, who now sat quite still within his circle of light, with darkness on all sides, and slipped into the room. He was greeted by the unified breathing of the three sleepers. Then he groped his way along the wall, looked for the settee, and upon finding it stretched out quietly, as though it were his usual bed. Since the student, who knew Delamarche well and had a precise understanding of the situation here and who, moreover, was an educated man, had advised him to stay, he had no qualms at all for now. He did not have such lofty aspirations as the student, for even at home who knew where he would have managed to finish his studies, and if this seemed scarcely possible at home, no one could expect him to do so here in this foreign country. But he would have greater hope of finding a post in which he could achieve something and be recognized for his achievements if he accepted the servant position at Delamarche’s, and then once he had that secure position, he could wait for a favorable opportunity to arise. On this very street there appeared to be many offices of middling or low stature, and if they were short of staff, they might not be all that particular about choosing new employees. If necessary, he would gladly become a messenger boy, but it was certainly not altogether inconceivable that he would be hired solely for office work and would someday become an office employee and sit at his own desk, where he could spend some time looking out the window without a care in the world, like the official he had seen that morning as they marched through the courtyard. When he closed his eyes, he was struck by the soothing thought that he was after all still young, and that Delamarche would eventually have to let him go; this household certainly didn’t look as if it would last forever. But if Karl should ever obtain such an office position, he would occupy himself exclusively with his office work and not dissipate his energy like the student. Besides, he would, if necessary, dedicate some nighttime hours to the office and indeed would even be required to do so because of his limited business training. He would think only of the interests of the business he served and gladly take on every task, even those that other clerical workers would reject as being unworthy of them. These good intentions jostled one another in his head as if his future boss stood before the settee reading them from his face."
"Karl allerdings fühlte sich so kräfig und bei Verstand, wie er es vielleicht zu hause niemals gewesen war. Wenn ihn doch seine Eltern sehen könnten, wie er im fremden Land vor angesehenen Persönlichkeiten das Gute ver- focht und wenn er es auch noch nicht zum Siege ge- bracht hatte, so doch zur letzten Eroberung sich voll- kommen bereit stellte. Würden sie ihre Meinung über ihn revidieren? Ihn zwischen sich niedersetzen und loben? Ihm einmal einmal in die ihnen so ergebenen Augen sehn? Unsichere Fragen und ungeeignetester Au- genblick sie zu stellen!","Karl, however, felt as strong and sane as he might never have been at home. If only his parents could see him fighting for good in a foreign country in front of distinguished personalities, and even if he had not yet achieved victory, he was perfectly ready for the final conquest. Would you change your mind about him? Sit him down between you and praise? Look him in the eyes so devoted to them? Uncertain questions and the most inopportune moment to ask them!","Karl for his part felt stronger and more alert than he had ever done at home. If only his parents could see him, fighting for a good cause in a strange land before distinguished people, and while he hadn’t won yet, he was absolutely ready for the final push. Would they change their minds about him? Sit him down between them and praise him? For once look into his eyes that shone with devotion to them? Doubtful questions, and hardly the time to start asking them now!","Still, Karl felt stronger and more alert than he had perhaps ever felt at home. If only his parents could have seen him defending a good cause before respected figures in a foreign land, and even if he had still not achieved victory, he was fully prepared to embark on the final conquest. Would they change their mind about him? Set him down between them and praise him? And then once, only once, take a look into these eyes, eyes that were so devoted to them? What uncertain questions, and what an inappropriate moment to be asking them!"
"Das war sehr ungerecht und Robinson schüttelte auch den Kopf und bewegte, allerdings lautlos, die Lippen, Karl jedoch sah ein, daß man auf die Herrschaf nur dadurch einwirken könne, daß man ihr zweifellose Ar- beit zeige. Er zog daher ein niedriges japanisches Tisch- chen aus einem Winkel, überdeckte es mit einem Tuch und stellte die mitgebrachten Sachen auf. Wer den Ur- sprung des Frühstücks gesehen hatte, konnte mit dem Ganzen zufrieden sein, sonst aber war, wie sich Karl sagen mußte, manches daran auszusetzen.","That was very unfair, and Robinson also shook his head and moved his lips, albeit silently, but Karl saw that one could only influence the rulers by showing them undoubted work. So he pulled a low Japanese table out of a corner, covered it with a cloth and set out the things he had brought with him. Anyone who had seen the origin of the breakfast could be satisfied with the whole thing, but otherwise, as Karl had to tell himself, there were a few things to complain about.","This was most unfair, and Robinson too shook his head and his lips moved although they didn’t make any sound, but Karl for his part could see that the only way of impressing his masters was by showing clear evidence of work. He therefore pulled a low Japanese table out of a corner, laid a cloth over it, and put out the things he had brought. Anyone who had seen the origins of this breakfast could not fail to be impressed with it, but for those others who hadn’t, as Karl had to admit, there were some grounds for criticism.","This was very unjust, to be sure, and Robinson too shook his head and moved his lips, though without making a sound; however, Karl realized that the only way to win over these masters was by showing them work of unquestionable quality. So he drew a low Japanese table from a nook, covered it with a cloth, and set up the items they had brought. Anybody who had seen this breakfast come about could not help but be satisfied with how everything had turned out, but as Karl had to admit, there were still a few shortcomings."
