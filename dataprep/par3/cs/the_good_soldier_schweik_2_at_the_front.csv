"„Vojáky je těžko vychovávat,“ řekl účetní šikovatel Vaněk zívaje. „Voják, který nebyl na vojně potrestán, není voják. To snad platilo v míru, že voják, který si odbyl bez trestu svou službu, měl potom přednost v civilní službě. Dnes právě ti nejhorší vojáci, kteří jindy v míru nevylezli z arestu, jsou ve válce nejlepšími vojáky. Pamatuji se u osmé maršky na infanteristu Sylvanusa. Ten měl dřív trest za trestem, a jaké tresty. Neostýchal se ukrást kamarádovi poslední krejcar, a když přišel do gefechtu, tak první prostříhal dráthindrnisy, zajmul tři chlapy a jednoho hned po cestě odstřelil, že prý mu nedůvěřoval. Dostal velkou stříbrnou medalii, přišili mu dvě hvězdičky, a kdyby ho byli později nepověsili pod Duklou, byl by už dávno cuksfírou. Ale pověsit ho museli, poněvadž po jednom gefechtu přihlásil se na rekognoscírunk a nějaká druhá patrola od jiného regimentu ho našla, jak šacoval mrtvoly. Našli u něho asi osm hodinek a mnoho prstenů. Tak ho pověsili u štábu brigády.“","""Soldiers are difficult to educate,"" said accountant Vanek yawning. ""A soldier who has not been punished in the war is not a soldier. This was perhaps true in peace, that a soldier who did his service without punishment then had priority in civilian service. Today, the worst soldiers who have never come out of peace in peace are the best soldiers in the war. I remember Infantryman Sylvanus at eighth marriage. He used to have punishment after punishment, and what punishments. He wasn't ashamed to steal his friend's last tailor, and when he came to the party, he was the first to cut through the drindindrnis, capture three men, and shoot one right down the road because he said he didn't trust him. He received a large silver medal, two stars were sewn to him, and if they had not been hanged under Dukla later, he would have been a sugar bear a long time ago. But they had to hang him, because after one face he enlisted in the reconnaissance and some other patrol from another regiment found him screaming corpses. They found about eight watches and many rings. So they hung him at the brigade staff. """,""" Besides, they're sure to chivvy us about again on some stunt or other, that'll only be a wash-out in the end, like they did yesterday with those tinned rations."" Quartermaster-sergeant Vanek yawned and asked whether he had been very talkative when he came home. ""Well, you was sort of flighty,"" said Schweik. ""You kept on saying something about shapes, and that a shape ain't a shape, and what ain't a shape is a shape and this shape ain't a shape.","“Soldiers are hard to be bringing up,” said Accountant Master Sergeant Vanek, yawning. “A soldier who has not been punished in the military service is not a soldier. It perhaps held true in peacetime that a soldier who finished his service and got out without having been punished was then getting preferential treatment in the civilian service. Nowadays the exact worst soldiers who had in other times of peace never crept out of jail are the best soldiers in war. I remember an infantryman, Sylvanus, at the Eighth march-gang. Earlier he used to receive punishment after punishment, and what punishments they were. He was not hesitating to steal the last penny from a pal, and when he got into combat, he was the first to cut through the barbed wire obstacles took three guys prisoners and one he shot dead immediately while on the way, saying that he did not trust him. He got the large silver medal, they sewed on two stars for him, and had they not later hanged him down under the Dukla pass he would had been a squad leader ages ago. But hang him they had to because after one combat he volunteered for reconnaissance, and some other patrol from another regiment found him as he was frisking the stiffs. They found about eight watches and many rings on him. So they hanged him at the Brigade Staff.”"

Von je v rangu hejtmana. Každej z těch feldkurátů, nižší nebo vyšší, už má takový nadání od boha, že se zežere při každý příležitosti pod vobraz boží.

""You can't do anything about it. He's tight as per regulations. He's got a captain's rank. All these army chaplains, whatever their rank, have got a sort of special gift from heaven, and you'd be surprised at the amount they can shift. I used to be orderly to old Katz, and he could drink like a fish. Why, this chap's nothing to what he was.

Bydlel přímo na četnické stanici a já, dobrák stará, pořád jsem byl všude v tý domněnce, že četnická stanice musí být přece někde na vystrčeným místě, jako na náměstí nebo podobně, a ne někde v zastrčenej uličce. Tak beru ty kraje městečka a nedívám se na nápisy. Beru to dům od domu, až přijdu v jednom takovým baráčku do prvního poschodí, votevřu dveře a voznámím se: ,Poníženě prosím, chudý vandrovní.‘ Jó, panečku! Nohy mně zdřevěněly. Vona to četnická stanice. Pušky u stěny, krucifix na stole, lejstra na almárce, císař pán kouká zrovna na mě nad stolem. A nežli jsem moh něco bleptnout, přiskočil ke mně vachmajstr a dal mně takovou facku v těch dveřích, že jsem po těch dřevěnejch schodech letěl až dolů a nezastavil jsem se až v Kejžlicích. To je četnický právo.“","And while the shepherd was sifting potatoes and pouring sour sheep's milk into a bowl, the wanderer continued to share his memories of the gendarmerie's right: ""In Lipnice there was a guard at the bottom of the castle. He lived right at the gendarmerie station, and I, good old man, was still everywhere in the belief that the gendarmerie station must be somewhere in a protruding place, like a square or something, and not somewhere in a hidden alley. So I take the edges of the town and I don't look at the inscriptions. I take it from house to house when I come to the first floor in one of these huts, open the door, and ride: 'Humiliated, please, poor wanderer.' My legs were wooden. It's a gendarme station. Rifles by the wall, a crucifix on the table, lejstras on the almari, the emperor lord is looking at me above the table. And before I could blink anything, the warden came to me and slapped me in the door so much that I flew down the wooden stairs and didn't stop in Kejžlice. That is gendarmerie law. ""","The shepherd then strained the potatoes and poured sour sheep's milk into the dish. After a hasty meal, they soon went to sleep in the warm shanty.","And while the shepherd was straining the potatoes and pouring sheep buttermilk into a bowl, the wanderer was sharing his memories of the State Police justice: “In Lipnice there used to be a State Police Master Sergeant down below the castle. He lived right at the State Police station and I, the good old guy, was always under the impression wherever I was that the State Police station had to be after all somewhere in a conspicuous spot, like a square or something similar, and not somewhere on a tucked away little side street. So I’m combing the edges of the town and I’m not looking at the signs and marquees. I’m taking it building by building until in this little one I come to the second floor, open the door and announce myself: ‘I humbly beg your pardon, a poor wanderer.’ My legs turned to wood on me. It was the State Police station. Rifles by the wall, the crucifix on the desk, official papers on the top of the cabinet, the Lord Emperor is looking right at me of all people from above the desk.

Tak ho museli vykopat z trestaneckýho hřbitova a rehabilitovali ho na plzeňskej katolickej hřbitov, a potom se teprve přišlo na to, že je evangelík, tak ho převezli na evangelickej hřbitov a potom…“","""In short and well,"" said Švejk, ""it's messy with you, but you must not lose hope, as Gypsy Janeček in Pilsen said, that it could still turn for the better when in 1879 he was given a no-brainer because of the double robbery neck.

I had to telephone all the way to the Army Court on account of you, you dumb cods.”"

The herbs were mixed into warm water for the cow, she would be let to drink from the slop sink and at the same time a little prayer to St. Pelegrinus, which was composed by Mister Tauchen, our shop clerk, was read to the cattle.

"Poněvadž železniční zřízenec neodpovídal, prohlásil Švejk, že znal nějakého Mlíčka Františka z Uhříněvse u Prahy, který také jednou zatáhl za takovou poplašnou brzdu a tak se lekl, že ztratil na čtrnáct dní řeč a nabyl ji opět, když přišel k Vaňkovi zahradníkovi do Hostivaře na návštěvu a popral se tam a voni vo něho přerazili bejkovec. „To se stalo,“ dodal Švejk, „v roce 1912 v květnu.“","As the railway caretaker did not answer, Švejk stated that he knew some Mlíček František z Uhříněvse near Prague, who also once put on such an alarm brake and was so afraid that he lost his speech for fourteen days and regained it when he came to Vaňek the gardener in Hostivař on visit and fought there and smelled in it bejkovec. ""It happened,"" Schweik added, ""in May 1912.""","As the railwayman did not reply, Schweik proceeded to explain that he had known a certain Frantisek Mlicek of Uhrineves near Prague who had also pulled an emergency brake and it had so scared him that he had lost his speech for a fortnight and only recovered it when he was paying a visit to a gardener named Vanek at Hostivar, and had a fight with someone there. "" That happened,"" added Schweik, ""in May, 1912.""","Because the railway attendant would not answer, Švejk declared that he knew some guy Mlícek, František by first name, from Uhríneves near Prague, who at one time also pulled down on such an emergency brake alarm and spooked so, that he lost his speech for two weeks and he regained it again when he came for a visit to Vanek, the gardener in Hostivare, and he got into a brawl there and they broke a blackjack in two when they whacked him. “That happened,” added Švejk, “in the year 1912, in May.”"
"Vida hrozný posuněk nadporučíkův, pokračoval Švejk laskavým hlasem: „Poslušně hlásím, pane obrlajtnant, že jsem vo tom, že ten kufr bude ukradenej, napřed nic nevěděl, a co se týká toho zrcadla a věšáku, tak jsem to voznámil panu domácímu, že mu to vrátíme, až přijdem z vojny domů. V nepřátelskejch zemích je hodně zrcadel i věšáků, takže ani v tomhle případě nemůžeme utrpět s panem domácím žádnou ztrátu. Jakmile dobyjeme nějaký město…“.","Seeing the lieutenant's terrible shift, Švejk continued in a kind voice: we'll return it when I get home from the war. There are a lot of mirrors and hangers in the hostile countries, so even in this case we cannot suffer any loss with the landlord. As soon as we conquer a city… "".","Seeing the lieutenant make a very wry face, Schweik continued in an affable tone :","Seeing the horrible gesture by the Senior Lieutenant, Švejk continued in a kind voice: “I humbly report Senior Lieutenant, Sir, that I knew nothing beforehand of the fact that the suitcase would be stolen, and as for the mirror and the coat hanger, I have to say that I informed our landlord that we would return them to him when we come back from the war.

"Jeden z těch kandidátů utrpení, propuštěný po operaci z vojenského lazaretu, v zamazané uniformě se stopami krve a bláta, přisedl k Švejkovi. Byl tak nějak zakrslý, vyhublý, smutný. Položil si na stůl malý balíček, vytáhl rozbitou tobolku a přepočítával si peníze.","One of those candidates for suffering, released from the military infirmary after the operation, in a smeared uniform with traces of blood and mud, sat down with Schweik. He was kind of stunted, emaciated, sad. He placed a small package on the table, pulled out a broken capsule, and counted the money.","One of these hapless wretches, who had just been discharged from hospital after an operation, in a uniform stained with patches of blood and mud, came and sat down next to Schweik. He was undersized, skinny, woebegone.

"Srazil paty dohromady, zasalutoval a vyšel na chodbu. Na schodech nebylo znát tak dalece nijakých stop zápasu, zde dle předpokladů Vodičkových odehrávalo se vše úplně lehce. Jedině potom u vrat v průjezde našel Švejk utržený nákrční límeček. Tam se patrně, když pan Kákonyi zoufale se zachytil domovních vrat, aby nebyl vyvlečen na ulici, odehrával poslední akt této tragédie.","He knocked his heels together, saluted, and went out into the hallway. There was no way of knowing any traces of the match on the stairs, here, according to Vodičková's assumptions, everything took place quite easily. Only then, at the gate in the passage, Schweik found a torn neck collar. There, apparently, when Mr. Kagoyi desperately caught the front door so that he would not be dragged down the street, the last act of this tragedy took place.","He clicked his heels together, saluted and went out into the passage. On the stairs there was not the slightest trace of any struggle ; everything had gone off with the utmost ease, just as Voditchka had said it would. But at the outer doorway Schweik discovered a collar which showed signs of having been wrenched off. Evidently it was there that the final act of the tragedy had occurred, when Mr. Kâkonyi had desperately clung to the doorway to save himself from being dragged into the street.","He slammed his heels together, saluted and walked out into the hall. On the stairs one could not detect much of any traces of a struggle, everything here was playing out absolutely with ease, according to Vodicka’s expectations. Only afterwards, by the gate in the drive-through arcade, Švejk found a torn off collar. There, apparently, when Mister Kákonyi desperately latched onto the building gate so that he would not be dragged out into the street, the final act of this tragedy was being played out."

The majority of the officers were wondering when the silly old buffer was going to stop his chatter, but Colonel Schroder prated on and on and on about the new duties of the new drafts, about the regimental officers who had fallen, about zeppelins, about barbed wire entanglements, about the military oath.","“Yes, gentlemen, Kramár, Scheiner, and Klofác17.” The majority of the officers was thinking at the same time ‘when is the old geezer going to stop driveling’, but Colonel Schröder was babbling on about new tasks of new march battalions, about the fallen officers of the regiment, about zeppelins, Spanish riders, the oath."

"„Já vám něco povím, pane kaprál,“ poznamenal Švejk, „já už jsem starej voják, sloužil jsem před válkou, a vono se to vždycky s těma nadávkama nevyplácí. Když jsem tenkrát sloužil před léty, pamatuju se, že u nás byl u kumpanie nějakej šupák Schreiter. Von sloužil za supu, moh jít už jako kaprál dávno domů, ale byl, jak se říká, uhozenej. Tak ten člověk na nás vojácích seděl, lepil se nám jako hovno na košili, to mu nebylo recht, to zas bylo proti všem foršriftům, sekýroval nás, jak jen moh, a říkal nám: ‚Vy nejste vojáci, ale vechtři.‘ Mě to jednoho dne dožralo a šel jsem ke kumpanieraportu. ‚Co chceš?‘ povídá hejtman. ‚Mám, poslušně hlásím, pane hejtmane, stížnost na našeho pana feldvébla Schreitra, my jsme přece císařští vojáci, a ne žádní vechtři. My sloužíme císaři pánu, ale nejsme žádní hlídači ovoce.‘ ‚Koukej, hmyze,‘ vodpověděl mně hejtman, ‚ať už tě nevidím.‘ A já na to, že prosím poslušně přeložit mě k batalionsraportu. U batalionsraportu, když jsem to vysvětlil obrstlajtnantovi, že nejsme žádní vechtři, ale císařští vojáci, dal mne zavřít na dva dny, ale já jsem žádal, aby mne přeložili k regimentsraportu. U regimentsraportu pan obršt po mým vysvětlování na mě zařval, že jsem pitomec, abych táh ke všem čertům. Já zas na to: ‚Poslušně hlásím, pane obršt, abych byl předveden k brigaderaportu.‘ Toho se lek a hned dal do kanceláře zavolat našeho šupáka Schreitra a ten mě musel vodprosit přede všema oficírama za to slovo vechtr. Potom mne dohonil na dvoře a voznámil mně, že vode dneška mně nadávat nebude, ale že mě přivede na garnizón. Já jsem si vod tý doby dával na sebe největší pozor, ale neuhlídal jsem se. Stál jsem post u magacínu a na stěně každej post na zeď vždycky něco napsal. Buď tam vykreslil ženský přirození, nebo tam napsal nějakej veršíček. Já jsem si na nic nemohl vzpomenout, a tak jsem se z dlouhý chvíle podepsal na stěně pod název ‚Supák Schreiter je hnáť. A ten pacholek supák hned to udal, poněvadž za mnou slídil jak červenej pes. Nešťastnou náhodou ještě nad tím nápisem byl jinej: ‚My na vojnu nepůjdeme, my se na ni vyséreme,‘ a to bylo v roce 1912, když jsme měli jít do Srbska kvůli tomu konzulovi Procházkovi. Tak mě hned poslali do Terezína k landgerichtu. Asi patnáctkrát tu zeď od magacínu s těma nápisama i s mým podpisem páni od vojenskýho soudu fotografovali, desetkrát mně dali napsat, aby zkoumali můj rukopis, ‚My na vojnu nepůjdeme, my se na ni vyséreme‘, patnáctkrát musel jsem psát před nimi ‚Supák Schreiter je hnáť, a nakonec přijel jeden znalec písma a dal mně napsat: Bylo 29. července 1897, kdy Králový Dvůr nad Labem poznal hrůzy prudkého a rozvodněného Labe. ‚To ještě nestačí,´ povídal auditor, ‚nám se jedná o to vysrání. Nadiktujte mu něco, kde je hodně s a r.´ Tak mně diktoval: Srb, srub, svrab, srabařina, cherubín, rubín, holota. Von už byl z toho ten soudní znalec písma tumpachovej a pořád se vohlížel dozadu, kde stál voják s bajonetem, a nakonec řekl, že to musí do Vídně, abych napsal třikrát za sebou: Také začíná už slunko pálit, horko je znamenité. Vodpravili celej materiál do Vídně a nakonec vyšlo to tak, že pokud se týká těch nápisů, že to není moje ruka, podpis že je můj, na kterej jsem se přiznal, a že za to jsem vodsouzenej na šest neděl, poněvadž jsem se podepsal, když jsem stál na vartě, a nemoh jsem prej hlídat po tu dobu, co jsem se podpisoval na zdi.“","""I'll tell you something, Corporal,"" remarked Schweik, ""I'm an old soldier, I served before the war, and it doesn't always pay off with those swear words. When I served years ago, I remember that there was a Schreiter fellow at our company. Von served as a vulture, he could have gone home long ago as a corporal, but he was said to have been hit. So the man sat on us soldiers, he stuck like shit on our shirts, it wasn't right for him, it was against all the forshrifts, he scribbled us as much as he could, and he said to us: 'You are not soldiers, but you are all.' one day it was over, and I went to the company. 'What do you want?' Says the governor. 'I have, I obediently report, Governor, a complaint against our Mr. Feldvébel Schreiter, we are imperial soldiers, not any all. We serve the Emperor of the Lord, but we are no guardians of the fruit. At the battalion report, when I explained to the enemy that we were not all, but imperial soldiers, he had me locked up for two days, but I asked to be transferred to regiments report. At the regiments report, Mr. Obrst, after my explanation, shouted at me that I was an idiot to go to hell. I said, 'Obediently report, Mr. Obrate, to be brought to the brigaderaport.' Then he caught up with me in the yard and told me that he would not curse me with the water of today, but that he would bring me to the garrison. I took the most care of the waters at the time, but I didn't watch. I stood at the post office and always wrote something on the wall of each post on the wall. Either he drew a woman's nature there, or he wrote a verse there. I couldn't remember anything, so for a long time I signed myself on the wall under the title 'Supre Schreiter is rushing.' And the little boy said it immediately, because he was snooping on me like a red dog. Unfortunately, there was another one above the inscription: 'We will not go to war, we will shit on it,' and that was in 1912, when we were to go to Serbia because of that Consul Procházek. So they immediately sent me to Terezín for a land register. About fifteen times the gentlemen from the military court photographed the magician's wall with those inscriptions and my signature, they let me write ten times to examine my manuscript, 'We will not go to war, we will shit on it', I had to write 'Supák Schreiter' before them fifteen times is rushed, and eventually an expert in writing came and had me write: It was July 29, 1897, when the King of Dvůr nad Labem knew the horrors of the raging and flooded Elbe. 'That's not enough,' said the auditor, 'we're talking about shit. Dictate to him something where there is a lot of s and r. Von was already a forensic tumpach writer, still looking back at the bayonet soldier, and finally said he had to go to Vienna three times in a row: The sun was also setting, the heat was great. They took all the material to Vienna, and in the end it turned out that as far as the inscriptions were concerned, that it's not my hand, the signature was mine, which I confessed to, and that I was sentenced to six weeks for that, because I signed, when I was standing on the gate, and I couldn't worry while I was signing the wall. ""","When Dr. Mrâz had gone, the corporal remarked gloatingly :","“I’ll tell you something, Mister Sergeant,” remarked Švejk, “I am already an old soldier, I had served before the war, and it never pays to be calling others names. When I was serving back then, years ago, I remember that there was some souper Schreiter in our company. He was serving for soup, and could have, as a sergeant, gone home long since, but he was, as the saying goes, not all there. So this man decided to pick on us soldiers, and he’d be sticking to us like shit to a shirt, this thing wasn’t right by him , that thing again was against all the rules; he was busting our chops any way he could, and he kept telling us: ‘You’re not soldiers, but railroad watchmen.’ It was eating me up until one day it got to me and I went to the Company Report. ‘What do you want?’ the Captain says. ‘I have, I dutifully report, Captain, Sir, a complaint against our Mister Quartermaster Schreiter, we are, after all, Imperial soldiers, and not railroad watchmen. We serve the Lord Emperor, but we are no fruit orchard guards.’ ‘Look, you insect,’ the Captain answered me, ‘make it so I don’t see you already.’ And I retorted that I beg dutifully to be transferred to the Battalion Report. When at the Battalion Report I explained it to the Lieutenant Colonel, that we were no watchmen, but Imperial soldiers, he had me locked up for two days, but I was requesting that they transfer me to Regimental Report. At the Regimental Report Mister Colonel, screamed at me after all my explaining that I was a numskull, and told me to blow to hell with all the demons. I in turn said to that: ‘I dutifully report Colonel, Sir, and demand to be presented to the Brigade Report.’ That spooked him and right away he had our souper Schreiter called to the office and he had to beg me for forgiveness in front of all the officers for that word watchman. Then he caught up with me in the yard and announced to me that starting today he wouldn’t be cussing me out, but that he’d bring it about that I end up in the garrison prison. From that time on I was really watching myself most closely, but I failed to keep myself in check. I was standing watch at the munition dump, and each posted sentry always wrote something on the wall of the masonry there. Either he drew a schematic of female genitals, or he wrote a little verse there. I could not remember or think of anything, so on account of the time dragging a long while I signed my name on the wall under the title ‘ Souper Schreiter is a dead man’s limb’. And that creep souper turned it in right away, because he was stalking me like a red dog. Through an unfortunate coincidence there was above the inscription still another one: ‘We’ll shit on the war, we won’t join up and go’, and that was in the year 1912 when we were to go into Serbia on account of that consul Procházka. So right away they sent me to Theresienstadt, to the Regional Court. The gentlemen from the military court photographed that munition dump wall with all that graffiti about fifteen times, ten times they had me write ‘We’ll shit on the war, we won’t join up and go’ so that they would study my handwriting, fifteen times I had to write in their presence ‘Souper Schreiter is a dead man’s limb’ and in the end a handwriting expert arrived and had me write down: The day was 29th of July 1897, when Králuv Dvur on the Labe came to know the horrors of the rapid Labe swelled out of bounds by flood. ‘That is not enough, yet,’ the auditor was saying , ‘we are after that shitting on. Dictate for him something where there are a lot of s’s and r’s.’ So he dictated for me: ‘A Serb, log cabin, scabs, chicken-shit dodge, cherub, ruby, riff-raff. The court handwriting expert was already totally baffled from it and kept looking back over his shoulder where there stood a soldier with a bayonet, and in the end said that it had to go to Vienna and for me to write three times in succession: ‘Also the sun is beginning to scorch already, the heat is excellent.’ They shipped out all of the material to Vienna and in the end the way it turned out was that as far as the inscriptions were concerned it was not my hand, that the signature was mine, which signature I owned up to, and that for that I was sentenced to six weeks because I signed my name when I was standing a watch, and I was then not able to be on guard during the time when I was signing my name on the wall.”"

"V tmavém prostoru lidomorny Mariánských kasáren Švejka uvítal srdečně tlustý jednoroční dobrovolník, provalující se na slamníku. Byl jediným vězněm a nudil se sám již druhý den. Na Švejkovu otázku, proč tam sedí, odpověděl, že pro maličkost. Napohlavkoval omylem jednomu poručíkovi od dělostřelectva v noci na náměstí v podloubí v opilém stavu. Vlastně ani nenapohlavkoval, srazil mu jenom čepici s hlavy. Stalo se to tak, že ten poručík od dělostřelectva stál v noci pod podloubím a patrně čekal na nějakou prostitutku. Byl obrácen k němu zády a jednoročnímu dobrovolníkovi připadal, jako by to byl jeho jeden známý jednoročák, Materna František.","In the dark area of the Marian Barracks of the Marian Barracks, Švejk was greeted by a heartfelt fat one-year-old volunteer lying on a straw mat. He was the only prisoner and was bored alone the next day. When asked by Švejk why he was sitting there, he answered that for a small time. He accidentally slapped one artillery lieutenant in the arcade square at night in a drunken state. In fact, he didn't even slap him, he just knocked off his cap. It so happened that the artillery lieutenant stood under the arcade at night, apparently waiting for a prostitute. He turned his back on him, and to the one-year-old volunteer it seemed like one of his well-known one-year-olds, Materna František.","He went back to his table and wrote a few lines on a piece of paper, called the sentry who was on guard in front of the orderly room, and told him to see that Schweik was taken to the warder with the chit.","In the dark space of the Marian garrison hunger pit a fat oneyear volunteer, lying about on a straw mattress, welcomed Švejk cordially. He was the only prisoner and was bored, all by himself a second day in a row already. To Švejk ’s question why he was sitting there doing time, he answered that it was on account of a trifle. He gave a full measure of head slaps, by mistake, to some officer of the artillery, in the night, in the arcade in the square, in a state of drunkenness. Actually, it was not a full measure of slaps, he only knocked the cap off his head. The way it happened was that the artillery officer was standing in the night in the arcade and apparently was waiting for some prostitute. The officer’s back was turned toward him, and to the one-year volunteer it appeared as if he were an acquaintance of his, one-year-timer Materna, František by his first name."

"Voják z eskorty cosi nejasně zabručel a kaprál provázející eskortu přiblížil se a naslouchal dalšímu výkladu jednoročního dobrovolníka, který vážně pokračoval: „Tato jediná rakouská kolonie může ledem zásobit celou Evropu a jest znamenitým národohospodářským činitelem. Kolonizace pokračuje ovšem pomalu, poněvadž kolonisti dílem se nehlásí, dílem zmrznou. Nicméně úpravou klimatických poměrů, na které má velký zájem ministerstvo obchodu i zahraniční ministerstvo, je naděje, že budou náležitě využitkovány velké plochy ledovců. Zařízením několika hotelů přivábí se spousty turistů. Bude ovšem třeba vhodně upravit turistické stezky a cesty mezi ledovými kry a namalovat na ledovce turistické značky. Jedinou obtíží jsou Eskymáci, kteří znemožňují našim místním orgánům jich práci… – Chlapi se nechtějí učit německy,“ pokračoval jednoroční dobrovolník, zatímco desátník se zájmem naslouchal. Byl to aktivní muž, v civilu býval čeledínem, byl pitomec a surovec, hltal všechno, o čem neměl zdání, a jeho ideálem bylo sloužit za supu.","The escort soldier muttered something vaguely, and the corporal accompanying the escort approached and listened to another explanation of the one-year-old volunteer, who went on seriously: However, colonization continues slowly, because the colonists do not report, they freeze. However, by adjusting the climate situation, which is of great interest to both the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is hoped that large areas of glaciers will be used properly. The equipment of several hotels attracts a lot of tourists. However, it will be necessary to adjust the hiking trails and paths between the icebergs and paint tourist signs on the glacier. The only difficulty is the Eskimos, who make it impossible for our local authorities to work for them - the guys don't want to learn German, ""the one-year-old volunteer continued as the corporal listened with interest. He was an active man, he used to be a groom in civilian clothes, he was an idiot and a savage, he devoured everything he had no idea about, and his ideal was to serve as a vulture.","The dutiful soldiers would later be squeezed into cattle trucks, while Schweik and the volunteer officer were to be accommodated in a special prisoners' compartment which, in troop trains, was always attached immediately behind the staff carriages.","The soldier from the escort growled something unclear and the sergeant accompanying the escort came nearer and listened in to a further exposition by the one-year volunteer who continued seriously: “This singular Austrian colony can keep supplying the whole Europe with ice and is a significant and outstanding factor in the national economy. Colonization is continuing slowly, however, because the colonists are, in part, not signing up and, in part, freezing to death. Nevertheless, by adjusting the climactic conditions, in which the Ministry of Trade and the Foreign Affairs Ministry as well are interested, there is hope that the icebergs comprising large surfaces will be appropriately utilized. By establishing several hotels, loads of tourists will be attracted. There will be a need, however, to appropriately adjust hiking trails and routes among the ice floes and to paint tourist orientation signs on the icebergs. The only bother are the Eskimos who prevent our local authorities from performing their work . . . — The guys don’t want to learn German,” continued the one-year volunteer, while the Sergeant was listening in with interest. He was an active man, in civilian life he used to be a servant on a farm, he was a numskull and a brute, who eagerly swallowed everything he had no notion about, and his ideal was to serve for soup, to stay on as an NCO."

Mladší sestra že se utopila, starší že se vrhla pod vlak, bratr že skočil z železničního mostu na Vyšehradě, dědeček že zavraždil svou ženu a polil se petrolejem a zapálil se, druhá babička že se toulala s cikány a otrávila se ve vězení sirkami, jeden bratranec že byl několikrát souzen pro žhářství a podřezal si v Kartouzích žíly na krku kouskem skla, sestřenice z otcovy strany že se vrhla ve Vídni z šestýho patra, von sám že je strašně zanedbanýho vychování a do deseti let že neuměl mluvit, poněvadž ve věku šesti měsíců, když ho převazovali na stole a někam vodběhli, kočka ho stáhla se stolu a pádem že se uhodil do hlavy. Mívá též občasné silné bolení hlavy a v takových okamžicích že neví, co dělá, a v takovým stavu že taky vodešel z fronty do Prahy, a teprve když ho zatkla u Fleků vojenská policie, že přišel k sobě. Panečku, měli jste vidět, jak ho ještě rádi pustili z vojny, a asi pět maníků, kteří seděli s ním v cimře, všichni si to pro všechen případ napsali na papírek asi takhle:","""You will do your best,"" said Schweik, ""if you pretend to be a fool now. When I was sitting in the garrison, there was such a smart man with us, a professor at business school. He was disembarking from the battlefield and had to be with him a very famous trial, so that he would be condemned and hanged for fear, and he would easily get out of it. He began to inherit, and when the staff doctor examined him, he said that he did not disclose out that he liked to travel with his youth, that he always had the desire to disappear somewhere far away. That he woke up once in Hamburg and a second time in London, and that he did not know how he got there. His father was an alcoholic and died by suicide before he was born, his mother was a prostitute and got drunk and died of delirium. A younger sister that she drowned, an older one that threw herself under a train, a brother that jumped off a railway bridge in Vyšehrad, a grandfather that murdered his wife and spilled kerosene and set himself on fire, a second grandmother that wandered with gypsies and poisoned herself with matches, one cousin that he was tried for arson several times and cut his veins in Carthusia with a piece of glass, a father's cousin that she threw herself on the sixth floor in Vienna, that he himself was terribly neglected and that he could not speak within ten years, because at the age of six months, when they tied him to the table and ran somewhere, the cat pulled him off the table and he fell into the head. He also has occasional severe headaches and at such moments that he does not know what he is doing, and in such a state that he also drove from the front to Prague, and only when he was arrested by the military police at the Fleks, he came to his senses. Dude, you should have seen how they still liked to let him out of the war, and about five maniacs sitting with him in the room all just wrote it down on a piece of paper like this:","The best thing you can do is to pretend you're barmy. When I was in the detention barracks, there was a chap, a smart fellow he was, a school teacher, and he did a bunk from the front line, and there was going to be a devil of a big trial so as to get him hanged and scare the rest of us. Well, he got out of it as easy as winking. When the staff doctor examined him he said he'd never done a bunk but he'd always been fond of travelling, ever since he was a kid, and he always wanted to see far countries, as the saying is. Once he woke up and found he was in Hamburg, and another time in London, and he never knew how he got there. He said his father had always been on the booze and had done himself in before he was born— this chap I mean, of course—and his mother had been a tart and had died of theD.T.'s. He said his younger sister had drowned herself, and the elder one had chucked herself under a train, and his brother had jumped off a railway bridge, his grandfather had done his grandmother in, this chap's grandmother I mean, and had then soaked himself with paraffin oil and set himself alight, and his other grandmother had gone gallivanting about with the gipsies and had poisoned herself with matches in prison, and one cousin had been sentenced several times for arson, and had cut the veins in his neck open with a piece of glass, and a female cousin on his father's side had chucked herself from a sixth-story window, and he himself was very backward and couldn't speak till he was ten, because when he was six months old, when they had tied him in up on a table, and then gone away somewhere for a minute, a cat had pulled him off the table and he'd fallen down and bumped his head. He said he still had very bad headaches every now and then, and when they came on he didn't know what he was doing, and that was the state he was in when he'd left the front line, and he didn't properly come to, like, till the military police were running him in. Holy Moses, you ought to have seen how they fairly fell over each other to get him out of the army, and other blokes who was in the same cell with him made notes on a bit of paper like this, because they thought it'd come in handy :","“You’ll do best,” said Švejk, “if you try passing yourself off for a moron. When I was sitting doing time at the garrison prison, there was such a smart man with us, educated, professor at a business school. He dezerted from the battle field and there was supposed to be a tremendously famous trial for him, so that he would be convicted and hanged to spread fear, and he slipped out of it tremendously simply. He started passing himself off for one handicapped by heredity, and when the staff physician examined him he declared that he did not dezert, that he liked to travel even since his youth, that he always had the desire to disappear to somewhere far away. That once he woke up in Hamburg and the next time again in London, and that he did not know how he got there. He said of his father that he was an alcoholic and died by a suicide before his birth, that his mother was a prostitute and would get drunk and died due to delirium. And he said that his younger sister drowned, that the older one threw herself under a train, that the brother jumped from a railroad bridge in the Vyšehrad neighborhood, that the grandfather murdered his wife and doused himself with petroleum and lit himself up, that the other grandma wandered with the Gypsies and poisoned herself in a prison by matches, that one cousin was tried several times for arson and he cut his veins in his neck by a piece of glass in the Kartouzy prison, a female cousin on the father’s side he said hurled herself from the seventh floor in Vienna, that he himself was of very negligent upbringing and until ten years of age could not speak because at the age of six months, when they were changing his wrap at a table they stepped away somewhere for a moment, a cat pulled him off the table and in the fall he banged up his head. He had occasional headaches from time to time and in such moments he didn’t know what he was doing, and it was also in such state that he left the front for Praha and he said that only when the military police arrested him at the U Flekù Pub he came to. Lordy, you should have seen how gladly they released him from the military in the end, and about five guys who were sitting with him in the same room doing time, they all, just in case they could use it, wrote it down on a piece of paper, something like this:"

Přece jste slyšel, že dvacátý osmý přešel k Rusům. Jak by se asi Rusové divili, kdyby zajali i černocha Kristiána.

Let's say the black man was taken away. He is from Prague, so he belongs to the 28th Regiment. You heard that the twenty-eighth crossed over to the Russians. How surprised the Russians would be if they captured the black Christian? Russian newspapers would certainly write that Austria is pushing its colonial troops into the war, which it does not have, that Austria has already reached black reserves. ""","Well, she's quite white, and then one day the wench produces a nigger baby for you."" They were now approaching the railway station, where the people of Budejovice had assembled to take leave of their regiment. It was not an official ceremony, but the square in front of the railway station was crowded with people who were awaiting the arrival of the troops. As usual, the dutiful soldiers marched behind and those under the escort of bayonets were in front. The dutiful soldiers would later be squeezed into cattle trucks, while Schweik and the volunteer officer were to be accommodated in a special prisoners' compartment which, in troop trains, was always attached immediately behind the staff carriages.","“The case of your black man Kristián,” said the one-year volunteer, “needs to be thought through from the warring vantage point. Let’s assume that the black man was drafted. He is a Praguer, so he belongs to the 28th Regiment. I’m sure you’ve heard that the Twenty Eighth crossed over to the Russians. How baffled would the Russians be if they captured and imprisoned among others also the black man Kristián. Russian newspapers would certainly be writing that Austria is now driving into the war even its colonial troops, which it does not have, that Austria has already reached for its black reservists.”"
"Švejka odvedli přes nádvoří a nadporučík s netajenou radostí se díval, jak profous odmyká dveře s černožlutou tabulkou Regimentsarrest, jak Švejk mizí za těmi dveřmi a jak za chvíli vychází profous sám z těch dveří.","Schweik was led across the courtyard, and the lieutenant watched with undisguised joy as the profousus unlocked the door with the black-and-yellow Regimentsarrest sign, as Schweik disappeared behind that door, and as soon as the profousus came out of that door.","""Yes, Schweik, you're for it now.""","He returned to his desk and wrote several lines on a piece of paper, hollered at the sentry outside the office and ordered him to take Švejk to the military prison guard and to hand the piece of paper over to him.

"Telefon drnčel však neúprosně dál, takže Švejka konečně přešla trpělivost, on vzal sluchátko a zařval do telefonu:","However, the phone rumbled relentlessly, so Švejk finally ran out of patience, he picked up the phone and shouted into the phone:",He took the receiver and bellowed into the mouthpiece :,"But the telephone kept buzzing inexorably on, so that Švejk’s patience ran out at last, he took the receiver and screamed into the phone:"

"Na takové hloupé služby vždy házeli rezervní důstojníky. Doktor Mráz byl z toho jelen. Nemohl se dopočítat pořád jednoho vagónu, ačkoliv byl v civilu profesorem matematiky na reálném gymnáziu. Kromě toho na poslední stanici hlášený stav mužstva z jednotlivých vagónů kolísal s číslem udaným po skončeném nástupu do vagónů na budějovickém nádraží. Zdálo se mu, když se díval do papírů, že kde se vzalo tu se vzalo o dvě polní kuchyně víc. Neobyčejně nepříjemné šimrání v zádech působilo mu konstatování, že se mu rozmnožili koně neznámým způsobem. V seznamu důstojníků nemohl se dopátrat dvou kadetů, kteří mu scházeli. V kanceláři pluku v předním vagóně hledali neustále jeden psací stroj. Z toho chaosu rozbolela ho hlava, snědl již tři aspirinové prášky a nyní revidoval vlak s bolestným výrazem v obličeji.","Reserve officers have always thrown such stupid services. Dr. Frost was a deer. He still couldn't count one car, even though he was a civilian professor of mathematics at a real high school. In addition, the status of the team from individual wagons reported at the last station fluctuated with the number given after boarding the wagons at the Budějovice station. It seemed to him, as he looked at the papers, that where it came from, two more field kitchens were taken. An unusually unpleasant tingling in his back caused him to state that his horses had multiplied in an unknown way. He couldn't find the two cadets he missed on the list of officers. In the regiment's office in the front car, they were constantly looking for a typewriter. The chaos made his head ache, he had already eaten three aspirin pills, and now he was revising the train with a pained expression on his face.","Reserve officers were always dropped upon for absurd jobs of that kind. Dr. Mrâz had got everything muddled up.

Also, he could not make the nominal roll, which he had received at the last station, tally with the figures which were reported after the troops had entered the train at Budejovice. Also, when he examined his documents, it seemed to him that there were two field kitchens too many, though for the life of him he couldn't make out where they had come from. Also, it made his flesh creep to discover that the horses had increased by some mysterious process. Also, among the officers, two cadets were missing and he had failed to run them to earth. Also, in the regimental orderly room which was installed in the front carriage a typewriter had disappeared. Now, as a result of this wholesale muddle, Dr. Mrâz had a splitting headache.

Ten byl ras na svý podřízený a tejral je, kde moh, a nejvíc si zalez na nějakýho vejhybkáře Jungwirta, až ten chudák se ze zoufalství šel utopit do řeky. Než to ale udělal, napsal psaní přednostovi stanice, že ho bude v noci strašit. A já vám nelžu. Proved to. Sedí v noci milej pan přednosta u telegrafního aparátu, ozvou se zvonky a přednosta přijme telegram: ‚Jak se máš, pacholku? Jungwirt.´ Celej týden to trvalo a přednosta počal posílat po všech tratích takovýhle služební telegramy jako odpověď tomu strašidlu: ‚Odpusť mně to, Jungwirte.´ A v noci nato vyklapá mu aparát takovouhle odpověď: ‚Oběš se na semaforu u mostu. Jungwirt.´ A pan přednosta ho poslech. Potom kvůli tomu zavřeli telegrafistu ze stanice před Svitavou.

He was a race for his subordinates, teasing them wherever he could, and leaning most on some Jungwirt vanguard, until the poor man, out of desperation, went to drown in the river. But before he did, he wrote to the stationmaster that he would haunt him at night. And I'm not lying to you. Do it. At night, my dear mayor, sits at the telegraph apparatus, the bells ring and the mayor receives the telegram: 'How are you, baby? Jungwirt. 'It took a whole week, and the boss began sending such telegrams on all lines in response to the ghost,' Forgive me, Jungwirt. ' Jungwirt.´ And Mr. Head listening to him.

""That's all right,"" said Schweik. ""I like talking to educated people. It'll be a fair treat for me to see that station master at Tâbor."" When the train arrived at Tâbor, Schweik with all due ceremony went to Lieutenant Lukash and said : ""Beg to report', sir, I'm being taken before the Station master.""","Švejk pulled a pipe from his jacket, lit it up, and, releasing the pungent smoke of the Austrian military ration tobacco, he continued: “Years ago the station master in Svitava was Mister Wagner. He was as tough as a butcher on his subordinates and he was cruel to them wherever he could be, but he persecuted most some switch operator Jungwirt, until out of desperation the wretch went to drown himself. Before he did it, however, he wrote a letter to the station master saying that he would haunt him at night. And I’m not lying to you. He did it. The dear Mister station master is sitting at night by the telegraph apparatus, the little bells start ringing and the station master receives a telegram: ‘How is it going, you creep? Jungwirt.’ It lasted a whole week and the station master started sending official telegrams down all the lines, like this answer to the ghost: ‘Forgive me for it, Jungwirt.’ And that night the apparatus punched out this sort of an answer: “Hang yourself on the signal pole by the bridge. Jungwirt.’ And the station master obliged him. Then they locked up a telegraph operator from the station one stop before Svitava on account of it.

"To já už dostal v regimentskanceláři takový rozhovor, že zítra pojedem, aby se pakovalo a šlo hned fasovat na cestu! A co jsem udělal, šel jsem pěkně sem na čtvrtku vína, sedí se mně tu pěkně a nechám to všechno běžet. Konzervy zůstanou konzervama, fasuňk fasuňkem. Já znám magacín lepší než pan obrlajtnant a vím, co se na takovým bešprechunku pánů oficírů u pana obršta mluví. To si pan obršt jen představuje ve své fantazii, že jsou v magacíně konzervy. Magacín našeho regimentu nikdy žádný konzervy neměl v zásobě a dostával je od případu k případu od brigády nebo si je vypůjčoval od jiných regimentů, s kterými se dostal do styku. Jenom benešovskému regimentu jsme dlužni přes tři sta konzerv. Cheche. Ať si říkají při bešprechunku, co chtějí, žádný kvalt. Však on jim magacinér, až tam naši přijdou, sám řekne, že se zbláznili. Ani jedna marška nedostala na cestu konzervy. – Viď, ty stará bramboro,“ obrátil se na štábního šikovatele. Ten však buď usínal, nebo dostával nějaké malé delirium, poněvadž odpověděl:","I have already had such an interview in the regiment's office that we will go tomorrow so that it will be packed and it will be immediately packed for the journey! And what I did, I came here nicely on a Thursday of wine, I sit nicely here and let it all run. Canned food will remain canned food. I know the magician better than the Lieutenant, and I know what is being said about such a cliché of the Lords of the Officers. Mr. Obršt only imagines in his imagination that they are canned in the magic. Our regiment's magacin never had any cans in stock and received them on a case-by-case basis from the brigade or borrowed them from other regiments with which it came in contact. We owe more than three hundred cans to the Benešov regiment alone. Cheche. Let them say what they want with a beech, whatever they want. However, when the magaciner comes to them, he will tell them that they have gone mad. Not a single brand got canned on the way. ""See, you old potato,"" he said to the staff trainee. However, he either fell asleep or received some small delirium because he replied:","Why, many's the time I've received orders in the regimental office that we was off the next day and I was to go and draw rations there and then. And what I did was to come here and have a quiet drink and just take things easy. The tinned rations won't run away. I know more about regimental stores than what the lieutenant does, and when the officers have one of these here confabs with the colonel, I know the sort of stuff they talk. Why, for one thing, there ain't any tinned rations in our regimental stores, and there never was. All the tinned rations we've got is inside the colonel's noddle. Whenever we want tinned rations, we just get it in driblets from the brigade, or we borrow it from other regiments if we happen to be in touch with them. Why, there's one regiment alone we owe more than 300 tins of rations to. Yes, sir! They can say what they like at their confab, but they're not going to bounce me. And the store keeper himself'll tell 'em they're barmy when they go there for the doings. Why, there ain't a single draft yet as had any tinned rations issued to it when it left for the front."" ""That's so, ain't it, you old pie-face?"" he added, turning to the staff sergeant-major, who, however, was either dropping off to sleep, or else was on the verge of a slight attack of delirium, for he replied :","The fact is that I have already gotten such an order at the Regimental Office, that tomorrow we’re going, that we’re to be packing and getting stuff issued for the road. And what did I do , I went and nicely came here for a quarter-liter of wine, sitting here is comfortable for me and I let everything run along. Cans will remain cans, getting provisions issued will remain getting provisions issued. I know the supply store better than Mister Senior Lieutenant and know what is being said in such discussions among the officer gentlemen at Mister Colonel’s. The fact is that Mister Colonel only imagines it in his fantasy, that there are cans in the supply store. The supply store of our regiment never had any food cans in stock and would get them only on a case by case basis from the brigade or would borrow them from other regiments with which it came into contact. Just to the Benešov town regiment we owe over three hundred cans. Ha ha. Let them say what they will during the conferences, don’t hold your breath. Wait, the supply store clerk himself will tell our folks when they get there that they’ve gone crazy. Not even one march-gang got cans for the road. — Isn’t that right you old potato?” he turned to the staff quartermaster.

"„Co se mý osoby týká, pane rechnungsfeldvébl, když jsem to slyšel, co vy jste vo těch outvarech povídal, tak jsem si vzpomněl na nějakýho Zátku, plynárníka; von byl na plynární stanici na Letný a rozsvěcoval a zas zhasínal lampy. Byl to osvětovej muž a chodíval po všech možnejch putykách na Letný, poněvadž mezi rozsvěcováním a zhasínáním lamp je dlouhá chvíle, a potom k ránu na plynárenské stanici vedl zrovna takový hovory jako vy, jenže ten zas říkal: ‚Kostka je hrana, proto je kostka hranatá.‘ Já to slyšel na vlastní voči, když mě jeden vožralej policajt předved pro znečištění ulice vomylem místo na policejní strážnici na plynárenskou strážnici. – A potom,“ řekl Švejk tiše, „to s tím Zátkou po čase skončilo moc špatně. Dal se do mariánský kongregace, chodil s nebeskýma kozama na kázání pátera Jemelky k Svatýmu Ignáci na Karlovo náměstí a zapomenul jednou zhasnout, když byli misionáři na Karláku u Svatýho Ignáce, plynový svítilny ve svým rajóně, takže tam hořel po ulicích plyn nepřetržitě po tři dny a noci. – To je velmi špatný,“ pokračoval Švejk, „když se najednou člověk začne plést do nějakýho filozofování, to vždycky smrdí delirium tremens. Před léty k nám přeložili od pětasedmdesátejch nějakýho majora Blühera. Ten vždy jednou za měsíc dal si nás zavolat a postavit do čtverce a rozjímal s námi, co je to vojenská vrchnost. Ten nepil nic jiného než slivovici. ‚Každej oficír, vojáci,‘ vykládal nám na dvoře v kasárnách, ‚je sám vod sebe nejdokonalejší bytost, která má stokrát tolik rozumu jako vy všichni dohromady. Nad oficíra si vůbec, vojáci, nic dokonalejšího nemůžete představit, i když byste na to mysleli po celej svůj život. Každej oficír je bytost nutná, kdežto vy jste, vojáci, jen bytosti pouze nahodilý, vy můžete existovat, ale nemusíte. Kdyby přišlo, vojáci, k vojně a vy jste padli za císaře pána, dobrá, tím by se moc nezměnilo, ale kdyby napřed pad váš oficír, teprve pak byste viděli, jak jste na něm závislí a jaká je to ztráta. Oficír musí existovat, a vy vlastně máte svou existenci jen vod pánů oficírů, vy od nich pocházíte, vy se bez oficírů neobejdete, vy se bez svý vojenský vrchnosti ani neuprdnete. Pro vás je oficír, vojáci, mravní zákon, ať tomu rozumíte nebo ne, a poněvadž každej zákon musel mít svýho zákonodárce, vojáci, je to jen oficír, ke kterému se cítíte a musíte cítit být vším povinni a beze vší výjimky plnit každý jeho nařízení, byť i se vám to nezamlouvalo.‘","""As far as my person is concerned, Mr. Rechnungsfeldvébl, when I heard what you said in those outvaries, I remembered some Stopper, a gasman; von was at the gas station on Letný and turned on and off the lamps. He was an enlightening man, and he went to Letný in all sorts of ways, because there was a long time between turning on and off the lights, and then in the morning at the gas station he made just the same calls as you, but he said: 'The cube is an edge, I heard it on my own when a drunken cop showed me for polluting the street by mistake instead of the police station at the gas station. - And then, ""Švejk said quietly,"" it ended very badly with that Zátka. He joined the Marian Congregation, went with the celestial goats to preach Father Jemelka to St. Ignatius on Charles Square, and forgot to go out once when the missionaries were in Karlak near St. Ignatius, gas lanterns in his district, so there gas burned in the streets continuously for three days. and night. ""That's very bad,"" Schweik continued, ""when you suddenly get involved in some kind of philosophizing, it always stinks of delirium tremens. Years ago, they transferred a major Blüher to us from the 1970s. Once a month, he called us and put us in a square, contemplating with us what military authority was. He drank nothing but plum brandy. 'Every officer, soldiers,' he explained to us in the courtyard of the barracks, 'he is the most perfect being himself, who has a hundred times as much sense as you all put together. You can't imagine anything more perfect than an officer, soldiers, even if you think about it your whole life. Every official is a necessary being, while you are soldiers, only beings only random, you can exist, but you don't have to. If it came, soldiers, to the war, and you fell for the emperor, well, that wouldn't change much, but if your officer first fell, you would only see how dependent you were on him and what a loss it was. The officer must exist, and you actually have your existence only in the waters of the lords of the officers, you come from them, you can't do without the officers, you won't even fight without your military authority. For you, the officer, the soldiers, is a moral law, whether you understand it or not, and since every law had to have its legislator, the soldiers, it's just the officer you feel and have to feel obligated by everything and without exception to comply with each of his orders. ""Even if you didn't like it.""","When Schweik woke up with the awakening morning which arrived with the smell of coffee essence boiling in all the company cook houses, he mechanically hung up the receiver, as if he had just finished talking on the telephone, and started off on a short morning stroll through the office.","“As for my personage, Mister Accountant Master Sergeant, when I heard what you were saying about those formations then I remembered this Zátka, a gasman; he was at the coal gas station at Letná and would light up and turn off the street lamps. He was a man who believed in enlightening community education and would hop all kinds of dives at Letná, because the while was long and dragging between the lighting up and turning off of the lamps, and then toward the morning at the coal gas station he engaged in just such soliloquies as you, except he would say: ‘A cube is all an edge and angle, that’s why a cube is angular.’ I heard it with my own eyes when a drunk cop brought me in to the coal gas station by mistake instead of the police station to be booked for having polluted the street. — And then,” said Švejk in a soft voice, “this Zátka ended up very badly after some time. He joined a Marian congregation, and would go with the heavenly goats to the sermons of Father Jemelka at the Saint Ignác in the Karlovo Square and he forgot to put out the gas lights in his beat once when the missionaries were in the Karlovo Square at the Saint Ignác, so that the gas was burning in the streets there without interruption for three days and nights. — It is very bad,” continued Švejk, “when a man starts all of a sudden messing with some philosophizing, it always reeks of delirium tremens. Years ago they transferred some Major Blüher to us from the seventy-fivers. He always had us called and stood in a square formation once a month and contemplated with us what the military overlords were. He drank nothing but slivovice. ‘Each officer, soldiers,’ he was telling us in the courtyard of the garrison, ‘is of himself the most perfect being which has a hundred times as much brain as all of you together. You cannot imagine anything surpassing an officer in perfection, soldiers, even if you were thinking about it your whole life. Each officer is a being necessary, whereas you soldiers are only beings merely incidental, you can exist, but don’t have to. If it came to a war, soldiers, and you fell for the Lord Emperor, well, nothing much would change on account of that, but if first your officer had fallen, only then you’d see how you’re dependent on him and what a loss it is. The officer must exist, and you, really, have your existence only derived from the officer lords, you originate from them, you cannot do without officers, you won’t even blow a fart without the military overlords. For you the officer is the moral law, soldiers, whether you understand it or not, and because each law has to have had its lawgiver, soldiers, it is only the officer to whom you are feeling and must feel obligated in all, and without any exception must fulfill each of his orders, even should it not appeal to you.’ “Then at one time, when he finished, he strolled around the square and was asking one after another:"

"„Já si to taky myslím,“ řekl Švejk, „kdybych voznámil panu obrlajtnantovi, že má ‚in der Folge genauer erlaubt gewesen oder das selbst einem hingegen immerhin eingeholet werden‘, ještě by se urazil. – Někdo je vám nedůtklivý až hrůza,“ pokračoval Švejk, zahořuje se opět ve vzpomínky. „Jednou jsem jel z Vysočan elektrikou do Prahy a v Libni k nám přišed nějakej pan Novotný. Jakmile jsem ho poznal, šel jsem k němu na plošinu a dal jsem se s ním do hovoru, že jsme oba z Dražova. On se ale na mne rozkřik, abych ho neobtěžoval, že prý mne nezná. Já jsem mu to začal vysvětlovat, aby se jen upamatoval, že jsem jako malej hoch k němu chodil s matkou, která se jmenovala Antonie, otec že se jmenoval Prokop a byl šafářem. Ani potom nechtěl nic vědět o tom, že se známe. Tak jsem mu ještě řekl bližší podrobnosti, že v Dražově byli dva Novotní, Tonda a Josef. On že je ten Josef, že mně psali o něm z Dražova, že postřelil svou ženu, když ho kárala z pití. A tu se vám von rozpřáh, já jsem se uhnul a on rozbil tabuli na přední plošině, tu velkou před řidičem. Tak nás vysadili, vodvedli a na komisařství se ukázalo, že byl proto tak nedůtklivý, poněvadž vůbec se nejmenoval Josef Novotný, ale Eduard Doubrava, a byl z Montgomery v Americe a zde byl navštívit příbuzný, ze kterých pocházela jeho rodina.“","""I think so, too,"" said Schweik. ""Someone is terrifying to you,"" Švejk continued, burning back into memory. ""Once I went by electrician to Vysočany to Prague and a Mr. Novotný came to us in Liben. As soon as I met him, I went to him on the platform and talked to him that we were both from Dražov. But he shouted at me so as not to bother him that he didn't know me. I began to explain it to him so that he would only remember that as a little boy I used to come to him with a mother named Antonie, a father named Prokop and a steward. Even then, he didn't want to know anything about each other. So I told him more details that there were two Novotní, Tonda and Josef, in Dražov. He is the one that Joseph wrote about him from Drazov, that he shot his wife when she scolded him for drinking. And here he stretches out to you, I dodged and he broke the board on the front platform, the big one in front of the driver. So they dropped us off, led us away, and it turned out at the commissioner that he was so reluctant, because his name was not Josef Novotný at all, but Eduard Doubrava, and he was from Montgomery, America, and his family's relatives came to visit. ""","Chuck it away."" ""You're about right, Sergeant,"" said Schweik. ""If I was to report to the lieutenant that he's got to 'subsequently closer permitted however has been nevertheless or thus has been notwithstanding the same to be reported,' I don't mind betting he wouldn't like it. ""Some people are terribly touchy,"" continued Schweik, plunging into reminiscence again. ""I remember once I was riding in a tram, and at one of the stopping places a chap named Novotny got in. As soon as I spotted him, I went over and joined him and started telling him we both came from the same town. But he started shouting he didn't know me and told me to go away and not to bother him. So then I started explaining to him how when I was a little boy I used to visit their house with my mother, whose name was Antonia and my father's name was Prokop, and he was an overseer on a farm. But even then he still made out he didn't know me. So I started telling him some details, just to convince him, and told him how there were two chaps named Novotny in our town, Tonda and Josef. And Josef, so they told me, had shot his wife because she kept grumbling at him for going on the booze. And then he lifted his arm, and I dodged him, so that he smashed a large pane of glass in the tram, right close to the driver. So they ejected us from the tram and took us to the police station, and there it turned out that the reason he was so touchy was because his name wasn't Novotny at all, but Dou-brava, and he'd come over from America to visit some relations.""","— Some people, let me tell you, are so touchy it ’s a horror,” continued Švejk, sinking into memories on impact again. “Once I was riding a streetcar from Vysocany into downtown Praha, and in the LibeH neighborhood some Mister Novotný hopped on. As soon as I recognized him I went to the front platform and started a conversation with him, saying that we’re both from Dražov. But he burst out hollering at me, telling me not to be bothering him, that he supposedly didn’t know me. I began explaining it to him, telling him to just remember, that as a little lad I used to come to him with my mother whose name was Antonie, that the father’s name was Prokop and he was a farmer. Even after that he did not want to know anything about the fact that we knew one another. So I told him yet more details, that in Dražov there used to be two Novotnýs, Tonda and Josef. That he was that Josef, and that they wrote to me about him from Dražov, saying that he shot and wounded his wife when she was rebuking him on account of his drinking. And here, let me tell you, he cocked his arm, I ducked, and he broke the pane on the front platform, the big one, in front of the motorman. So they disembarked us, took us away, and at the Police Headquarters it became apparent that he had been so touchy because his name wasn’t Josef Novotný at all, but Eduard Doubrava, and he was from Montgomery in America and was here just visiting his relatives from among whose ancestors came his family.”"

Von could only steal our suitcase at such a favorable moment. After such a moment, they smell.

He must have pinched that trunk just at a moment when the coast was clear. They're always on the look-out for a chance like that. Two years ago, at the North-Western station, they stole a young lady's perambulator with a baby girl wrapped up inside, and they went and handed the baby over at the police station in our street, where they said they'd found it left in a doorway. And then the papers called that poor young lady an inhuman monster.""","“I dutifully report, Lieutenant, Sir,” voiced Švejk softly, “they really stole it. At railroad stations there are always a lot of such cons hanging around, and the way I imagine it happened is that your suitcase undoubtedly struck a chord with one of them and this man undoubtedly utilized the fact that I walked away from the luggage to report to you that regarding our luggage everything was alright. He could steal that suitcase of yours exactly at an opportune moment like that. They hunt far and wide for a moment like that to graze on. Two years ago at the Northwestern Station they stole a baby carriage from one prissy lady, including the little girl laid in down pillows and blankets, and they were so magnanimous that they turned the little girl in at the police headquarters in our street saying they found her abandoned in a carriageway arcade. The newspaper then made the pitiful lady out to be the krkavcí matka, ravens’ mother of the fairy-tale who, being exhausted by hardship, cast a spell in anger and turned her own seven sons into ravens.”"

As soon as it was full, they drove it to the medical aid station. The Russians, having discovered the wagons, started hurling shells at them. A horse of transport driver Josef Bong of the I&R 3rd Transport Squadron was killed by a fragment of a shell. Bong lamented: “Poor white steed of mine, you are done for!” At that moment he himself was hit by a piece of a shell. In spite of it, he unhitched the horse and led a team of three horses behind a safe shelter. Thereupon he returned for the harness of his dead horse. The Russians kept on shooting. “Just go on shooting, you darn madmen; I will not leave the harness here!” and he continued taking the harness off the horse, mumbling those words. At last he was done and dragged himself and the harness back to the wagon. His fate there was to hear out the full measure of raging thunder of abuse by the medical corpsmen because of his long absence. “I didn’t want to leave the harness there, it’s almost new. It would be a waste, I thought. We don’t have a surplus of such things,” said the intrepid soldier apologetically, driving away to the medical aid station where only then he reported as a casualty.

He swallowed the bowls of sauces and dumplings, tore the flesh from the bones like a feline, and finally got rum in the kitchen, which when he got on and cringed, returned to the farewell party, where he became famous for his new booze. He had extensive experience in this and the 7th Cavalry Division always paid extra for him. In the morning, he had the idea that he had to tidy up the departure of the regiment's first echallons, so he wandered the length of the trench, performing at the station so that the regiment's officers closed in front of him in the stationmaster's office.","His story was an exceedingly simple one. He had arrived at Budejovice on the previous day and had managed to attend a little party arranged by the officers of the departing regiment. He ate and drank for a dozen, and then in a more or less sober condition he had strolled into the officers' mess, to wheedle a few leavings from the cooks. After consuming many dumplings and much gravy, he got into the kitchen and discovered rum there. He swilled rum till he began to hiccough, and then returned to the farewell party, where he distinguished himself by a new round of libations. In the morning it occurred to him that he really ought to go and make sure that the first battalion of the regiment got a proper send-off.","His personal history was more than simple. He arrived at Budejovice yesterday, he, the terror of all officers’ messes, insatiable mountain of a man, ever the glutton, and as if by chance he participated in a small banquet for the officers of the departing regiment. He ate, drank as much as ten, and in a more-or-less not sober state would go into the officers’ mess to beg the cooks for some leftovers. He would be gobbling up bowls of gravy and dumplings, ripping meat off the bones like a feline predator and in the end worked his way through the kitchen to the rum, and after having swallowed his fill of it till he was burping, he returned to the evening farewell gathering, where he distinguished himself famously by a new round of soaking up booze. He had a wealth of experience in it, and at the 7th Cavalry Division it was always the other officers who ended up subsidizing him. In the morning he got the idea that he had to put things in order during the departure of the first military transport train of the Regiment, and that is why he was walking about up and down the length of the crowd lining the street, and acting in such a way at the railroad station that the officers directing the regimental traffic locked themselves inside the Station Master’s Office to hide from him."

"„Poslušně hlásím, pane obrlajtnant,“ ozval se Švejk, tváře se jako mučedník, „že já vůbec nikdy v životě jsem neměl toho nejmenšího úmyslu někoho urazit a že vůbec nemám ponětí a zdání o nějakým panu generálmajoru. Von vopravdu je celej pan Purkrábek, zástupce banky Slávie. Ten chodil k nám do hospody a jednou, když u stolu usnul, tak mu na jeho pleš nějakej dobrodinec napsal inkoustovou tužkou: ,Dovolujeme si vám tímto dle připojené sazby IIIc zdvořile nabídnouti nastřádání věna a vybavení vašich dítek pomocí životního pojištění!‘ To se ví, že všichni vodešli, a já tam s ním zůstal sám, a poněvadž mám vždycky smůlu, tak von potom, když se probudil a podíval se do zrcadla, se rozčilil a myslel, že jsem to jemu udělal já, a chtěl mně dát taky pár facek.“","""I dutifully report, Lieutenant,"" Schweik said, his face like a martyr, ""that I had never had the slightest intention of offending anyone in my life, and that I had no idea and appearance about a major general."" Von really is Mr. Purkrábek, a representative of the Slavia Bank. He used to come to our pub, and once he fell asleep at the table, a benefactor wrote in ink on his bald spot: that they all went, and I stayed there alone with him, and since I'm always unlucky, outside after he woke up and looked in the mirror, he got upset and thought I did it to him, and he wanted to give me some too. slap. ""","""Beg to report, sir,"" announced Schweik, with the air of a martyr, ""never in my life have I had the least intention of insulting anyone and it's news to me about him being a major-general. As true as I stand here, he's the living image of Mr. Purkrâbek, agent of the Slavia Bank. He used to come to our pub and once, when he fell asleep at a table, some joker wrote on his bald head with a copying-ink pencil : 'Please note our scheme for safeguarding your children's future as per schedule IIIc enclosed.' Well, they all cleared off, and I was left alone with him, and it was just my luck that when he woke up and saw himself in the glass, he didn't half get ratty and he wanted to give me a good hiding, too.""","“I dutifully report, Senior Lieutenant, Sir,” sounded up Švejk, showing the countenance of a martyr, “that I have never in my life had the slightest intention to offend anybody and that I have no idea or notion at all of some lord major general. He really is the complete likeness of Mister Purkrábek, the representative of the Slávie Bank. He used to come to our pub and once, when he fell asleep at the table, some benefactor wrote on his bald head with an indelible pencil: ‘We are taking the liberty hereby to deferentially offer to you to save up a dowry and for appurtenances of your children through a life insurance policy in accordance with the attached premium schedule IIIc!’ It goes without saying that all of them had left and I alone remained there with him, and so because bad luck always sticks to me like sap, when he woke up and looked into the mirror, he got upset then and thought that it was I who did it to him and he also wanted to slap me a few.”"
"Potom byl ještě druhý případ. S jednoročním dobrovolníkem Markem dodán byl současně na hauptvachu od divizijního soudu falešný četař Teveles, který se nedávno objevil u regimentu, kam byl poslán z nemocnice v Záhřebě. Měl velkou stříbrnou medalii, odznaky jednoročního dobrovolníka a tři hvězdičky. Vyprávěl o hrdinských činech 6. maršové roty na Srbsku a že zbyl z ní jen sám. Vyšetřováním bylo zjištěno, že s 6. marškou na začátku války odešel skutečně nějaký Teveles, který však neměl práva jednoročního dobrovolníka. Vyžádána byla zpráva od brigády, ku které byla 6. marška přikomandýrována, když 2. prosince 1914 se utíkalo z Bělehradu, a zjištěno, že v seznamu navržených nebo vyznamenaných stříbrnými medaliemi není žádný Teveles. Byl-li však pěšák Televes povýšen v bělehradské válečné kampani za četaře, nedalo se naprosto zjistit, poněvadž celá 6. marškumpanie se ztratila u cerkve sv. Sávy v Bělehradě i se svými důstojníky. U divizijního soudu hájil se Teveles tím, že opravdu mu byla slíbena velká stříbrná medalie a že si ji proto v nemocnici koupil od jednoho Bosňáka. Co se týká prýmků jednoročního dobrovolníka, ty že si přišil v opilství a že je nosil dál proto, poněvadž byl stále opilý, maje úplavicí zeslabený organismus.","Then there was the second case. At the same time as the one-year-old volunteer Mark, a fake sergeant, Teveles, who recently appeared with the regiment, where he was sent from the hospital in Zagreb, was delivered to the division court on a hauption court. He had a large silver medal, one-year-old volunteer badges and three stars. He told of the heroic deeds of the 6th March Company in Serbia and that he was left alone. The investigation revealed that with the 6th March at the beginning of the war, a Teveles did leave, but he did not have the rights of a one-year volunteer. A report was requested from the brigade, to which the 6th March was commanded when he fled Belgrade on December 2, 1914, and it was found that there was no Teveles on the list designed or awarded with silver medals. However, if the infantryman Televes was promoted as a sergeant in the Belgrade war campaign, it was impossible to find out completely, because the entire 6th Marshal Company was lost at the Church of St. Sava in Belgrade and its officers. Teveles defended himself in the divisional court by saying that he had indeed been promised a large silver medal and that he had therefore bought it from a Bosniak in the hospital. As for the braids of the one-year-old volunteer, he sewed himself intoxicated and continued to wear them because he was still drunk, having a dysfunctional weakened organism.","Then there was another matter. Marek, on his arrival at the guard room, was accompanied by a certain Teveles, a bogus sergeant. This gentleman had recently come under the notice of the regiment, to which he had been sent from the military hospital at Zagreb. He wore the large silver medal, the badges of a volunteer officer and three stars. He told some stirring tales about the doughty deeds of the 6th draft in Serbia, of which he claimed to be the sole survivor. As the result of inquiries, it was discovered that at the beginning of the war there had been a Teveles in the 6th draft, but that he was not entitled to claim the rank of a volunteer officer. The brigade to which the 6th draft had been attached after retiring from Belgrade on December 2, 1914, reported that there was no Teveles on the list of names recommended for, or decorated with, silver medals. Whether Private Teveles, however, had been promoted to sergeant during the Belgrade campaign could not be ascertained at all, because the whole of the 6th draft, officers included, had got lost at St. Sava's Church in Belgrade. Before the court-martial Teveles had defended himself by the argument that he had been promised the large silver medal, and that he had therefore bought one from a Bosnian, while in hospital. As regards the volunteer officer's badges, he had sewn them on while drunk, and he had continued to wear them because he was always drunk, owing to the weakening of his constitution by dysentery.","Then there was another case. Concurrently with one-year volunteer Marek there was delivered to the main guard-house from the Divisional Court the fake Squad Leader Teveles who not long ago showed up at the regiment where he was sent from a hospital in Zagreb. He had the large silver medal, pins of a one-year volunteer, and three little stars. He was telling of heroic deeds of the 6th March Company in Serbia, and that he alone had been left of it. Through an investigation it was determined that with the 6th march-gang at the beginning of the war actually did leave some one Teveles who however did not have the privileges of a one-yearvolunteer. A report was requested from the brigade to which the 6th march-gang was ordered to attach when on December 2nd, 1914 the running away from Belgrade was underway, and it was determined that on the list of those nominated or awarded the silver medal there was no Teveles. Whether infantryman Teveles had been promoted to squad leader during the Belgrade military campaign could not be absolutely ascertained because the whole 6th March Company was lost at the St. Sáva Church in Belgrade, including its officers. Teveles was defending himself at the Division Court by stating that he was really promised the large silver medal and that is why he bought it at the hospital from a Bosnian guy. As for the one-year volunteer stripes, he said that he sewed them on for himself in a drunken state, and that he kept wearing them because he was constantly drunk having had his bodily organism weakened by dysentery."

"Švejk začal: „Na světě nezůstane nic utajeno. Všechno vyjde najevo, jak jste slyšeli, že i taková blbá sojka není žádnej vořešník. Je to vopravdu velice zajímavý, že se někdo dá na takovou věc chytit. Vymejšlet si zvířata je pravda věc těžká, ale ukazovat taková vymejšlená zvířata je vopravdu ještě těžší. Jednou před lety byl v Praze nějakej Mestek a ten vobjevil mořskou pannu a ukazoval ji na Havlíčkově třídě na Vinohradech za plentou. Ve plentě byl otvor a každej moh vidět v takovej polotmě prachvobyčejný kanape a na něm se válela jedna ženská ze Žižkova. Nohy měla zabalený do zelenýho gázu, co mělo představovat vohon, vlasy měla natřený nazeleno a na rukách rukavice a na nich přidělaný ploutve z papenteklu, taky zelený, na hřbetě měla provázkem upevněný nějaký kormidlo. Mládež do šestnácti let tam neměla přístupu a všichni, kterým bylo přes šestnáct let a zaplatili si vstupný, moc si libovali, že ta mořská panna má velikou zadnici, na který byl nápis ‚Na shledanou!‘ Co se týká ňader, to nebylo nic. Házely se jí až na pupek jako utahanej flundře. V sedum hodin večer pak Mestek zavřel panoramu a řek: ‚Mořská panno, můžete jít domů,‘ vona se převlíkla a v deset večer už ji bylo vidět chodit po Táborskej ulici a zcela nenápadně každýmu pánovi, kterýho potkala, říkat: ‚Hezoune, šel si to zafilipínkovat.´ Poněvadž neměla knížku, tak ji při šťáře s druhejma podobnejma myšema pan Drašner zavřel, a Mestek měl po kšeftě.“","Schweik began: ""Nothing will remain secret in the world. Everything will come out, as you have heard, that even such a stupid jay is no scumbag. It's really very interesting that someone can catch such a thing. Making up animals is really a difficult thing, but showing such made up animals is really even harder. Once years ago, there was a Mestek in Prague, and he discovered a mermaid and showed her on Havlíčkova třída in Vinohrady behind the curtain. There was an opening in the curtain, and everyone could see a strange couch in such a semi-darkness, and a woman from Žižkov was rolling on it. Her legs were wrapped in green gauze, which was supposed to represent a steering wheel, her hair was painted green and gloves and papentecal fins attached to them on her hands, also green, and she had a rudder attached to her back. Young people under the age of sixteen did not have access to it, and everyone who was over sixteen years old and paid the entrance fee was very happy that the mermaid had a big ass that said, ""Goodbye!"" As for the breasts, it was nothing. They tossed at her navel like a tight-lipped flounder. At seven o'clock in the evening, Mestek closed the panorama and said: 'Mermaid, you can go home,' the dress changed, and at ten o'clock she could be seen walking down Táborská Street and saying unobtrusively to every gentleman she met, 'Cute, he went Because she didn't have a book, Mr. Drašner closed it down when he was having fun with other similar mice, and Mestek had a deal. ""","""Almighty God,"" exclaimed the volunteer officer, clasping his hands together, ""fill our hearts with love for all N. C. O.'s, that we may not behold them with repugnance.","Švejk began: “Nothing in the world will remain concealed. Everything will come out, as you have heard, even the fact that a dumb jay is no wallnutter. It is really very interesting to hear that anybody would be fooled by such a thing. To make up animals is really even harder. Once, years ago in Prague there was one Mestek by last name and he discovered a mermaid and was exhibiting her on Havlícek Boulevard in the Vinohrady neighborhood behind a curtain. There was an opening in the curtain and in something approaching darkness everybody could see a sofa as common as dust, and on it was wallowing a broad from the Žižkov neighborhood. She had her legs wrapped in green gauze that was supposed to be representing the tail , she had her hair painted over green and hands in gloves, and attached to the gloves were fins of cardboard, also green, and on her back she had some rudder tied down with a string. Youth up to sixteen years of age were not admitted, and all who were older and paid their admission were taking pleasure in that the mermaid had a big rump on which there was written ‘Goodbye!’ As for the bosom, it was nothing. Her breasts were dangling all the way to her navel as they do on a dragged-down-tired floozie. Then at seven o’clock in the evening Mestek closed up the panorama and said: ‘Mermaid, you can go home now, ma’am’; she changed and at ten at night one could see her already walking up and down Táborská Street and quite inconspicuously telling each gentleman she’d pass: ‘ Good looking, why don’t you come and shake it out a bit.’ Since she didn’t have the registration booklet, then Mister Drašner locked her up during a crackdown with other similar mice, and Mestek was out of business.”"
"„Hledal regiment?“ řekl, „to je pěkná túra. Tábor, Milevsko, Květov, Vráž, Malčín, Čížová, Sedlec, Horažďovice, Radomyšl, Putim, Štěkno, Strakonice, Volyň, Dub, Vodňany, Protivín, Putim, Písek, Budějovice. Trnitá cesta. I vy zítra k regimentsraportu? Bratře, na popravišti se tedy sejdeme. To zas má náš obrst Schröder pěknou radost. Nedovedete si ani představit, jak na něho účinkují plukovní aféry. Lítá po dvoře jako pominutý hafan a vysunuje jazyk jako mrcha kobyla. A ty jeho řeči, napomínání, a jak přitom plivá kolem sebe, jako uslintaný velbloud. A ta jeho řeč nemá konce a vy čekáte, že co nejdřív musí spadnout celé Mariánské kasárny. Já ho znám dobře, poněvadž již jednou jsem byl u takového regimentsraportu. Narukoval jsem ve vysokých botách a na hlavě jsem měl cylindr, a poněvadž mně krejčí včas nedodal uniformu, tak jsem přišel za školou jednoročáků na cvičiště i ve vysokých botách a v cylindru a postavil jsem se do řady a mašíroval s nimi na levém flangu. Obrst Schröder přijel na mne přímo na koni a div mne nepovalil na zem. ‚Donnerwetter,´ zařval, až to bylo slyšet jistě na Šumavě, ‚was machen Sie hier, Sie Zivilist?‘ Odpověděl jsem mu slušně, že jsem jednoroční dobrovolník a že se zúčastňuji cvičení. A to jste měl vidět. Řečnil půl hodiny a teprve potom si všiml, že salutuji v cylindru. To už zvolal jen, že zítra mám jít k regimentsraportu, a hnal to na koni ze vzteku až bůhvíkam jako divoký jezdec, a zas přicválal, opět nanovo řval, zuřil, bil se v prsa a poručil mne okamžitě ze cvičiště odstranit a dát na hauptvachu. Při regimentsraportu mně napařil kasárníka na čtrnáct dní, dal mne obléct do nemožných hadrů ze skladiště, hrozil mně odpáráním štráfků. – ,Jednoroční dobrovolník,´ blbl ten pitomec obrst nahlas, ‚je cosi vznešeného, jsou to embrya slávy, vojenské hodnosti, hrdinové. Jednoroční dobrovolník Wohltat, byv po odbyté zkoušce povýšen na kaprála, dobrovolně přihlásil se na frontu a zajal patnáct nepřátel a při odevzdávání jich byl roztržen granátem. Za pět minut došel pak rozkaz, že jednoroční dobrovolník Wohltat je povýšen na kadeta. I vás by čekala taková skvělá budoucnost, postup, vyznamenání, vaše jméno bylo by zaneseno do zlaté knihy pluku.“","""Was he looking for a regiment?"" He said, ""that's a nice hike. Tábor, Milevsko, Květov, Vráž, Malčín, Čížová, Sedlec, Horažďovice, Radomyšl, Putim, Štěkno, Strakonice, Volyň, Dub, Vodňany, Protivín, Putim, Písek, Budějovice. Thorny road. You too for regimentsports tomorrow? Brother, we'll meet at the execution site. This, in turn, is a great joy for our Schröder. You can't even imagine how regimental scandals affect him. He flies around the yard like a missing hafan and pulls out his tongue like a mare bitch. And his words, his reprimands, and how he spits around him, like a drooling camel. And his speech has no end, and you expect the entire Marian Barracks to fall as soon as possible. I know him well, because I've been to such a regiments report before. I was in high boots and I had a top hat on my head, and since the tailor didn't deliver my uniform in time, I came to the one-year-old school at the training ground in high boots and top hat and stood in line and marched with them on the left flange. The giant Schröder came at me directly on horseback, and wonder did not knock me to the ground. 'Donnerwetter,' he shouted, when it was certainly heard in the Bohemian Forest, 'Was you here, you were a civilian?' I replied politely that I was a one-year-old volunteer and that I was participating in the exercise. And you should have seen that. He spoke for half an hour, and only then did he notice that I was saluting in a top hat. He just called out that I have to go to regimentsraport tomorrow, and he drove it on horseback from rage to the savage rider, and he called again, roared again, raged, beat his chest and ordered me to remove me from the training ground immediately and put me on the hauption . During the regimentsport, he steamed my barracks for a fortnight, had me dressed in impossible rags from the warehouse, threatened me by evaporating the straps. ""A one-year-old volunteer,"" said the idiot, who is aloud, ""there is something noble, they are embryos of glory, of military rank, of heroes. One-year-old volunteer Wohltat, who was promoted to corporal after the rehearsal, volunteered for the front and captured fifteen enemies and was torn apart by a grenade. In five minutes, the one-year-old Wohltat volunteer was promoted to cadet. You would also have such a great future, a procedure, a decoration, your name would be entered in the regimental golden book. ""","""Looking for your regiment, eh?"" he said. ""You had a regular Cook's tour. And you're for it to-morrow. Brother, we're in the same boat. We shall meet again in the shadow of the gallows. Colonel Schroder's going to have the time of his life. You wouldn't believe what a fuss he makes over any little shindy in the regiment. He rushes about the barrack square with his tongue hanging out like a rabid bull dog. And you ought to see him making speeches and chewing the rag generally. He dribbles at the mouth like a camel with an attack of the mumps. Once he gets started, there's no end to it, and you'd think the whole blessed barracks was going to fall to pieces."" The door opened and admitted the warder, who brought a quarter of a portion of army bread for the two of them, together with some fresh water. Without rising from the straw mattress, the volunteer officer addressed the warder as follows :","“Were looking for the regiment?” he said, “That’s a pretty trek. Tábor, Milevsko, Kvetov, Vráž, Malcín, Cížová, Sedlec, Horaždovice, Radomyšl, Putim, Štekno, Strakonice, VolyH, Dub, VodHany, Protivín, Putim, Písek, Budejovice. A thorny path. You too will be at the Regimental Report tomorrow? Brother, then we’ll meet in the execution yard. Our Colonel Schröder then surely has great joy again. You cannot even imagine how regimental scandals affect him. He flies around in the yard like a bowser that lost its mind and sticks out his tongue like a half-dead mare. And that talk of his, the reprimands, and at the same time he’s spitting round himself like a drooling camel. And that speech of his having no end in sight, and you’re waiting and expecting that the whole Marian garrison must tumble down any minute. I know him well, because I had been at such a Regimental Report once already. I was drafted and joined the military in high boots and had a bowler hat on my head, and as the tailor had not delivered the uniform to me on time I came to the training ground behind the one-year-timer school in those high boots and the bowler and I stood myself in the rank and marched with them on the left flank. Colonel Schröder came directly after me riding a horse and it’s a wonder he did not knock me down to the ground. ‘Damn it’, he screamed so that it could certainly be heard in the Šumava region, What are you doing here, you civilian?’ I answered him politely that I was a one-year volunteer and that I was participating in the training. And you should have seen what followed. He exercised his rhetorical skills for half an hour, and only after that he noticed that I was saluting with a bowler hat on my head. At that point he only yelled out that tomorrow I was to go to the Regimental Report, and in rabid anger he rode the horse hard all the way to God knows where like a wild horseman, and he returned galloping back again, started screaming anew, raged, beat his chest and ordered that I be removed from the training ground immediately and put in the main guard-house. During the regimental report he slammed me with a confinement to the barracks for two weeks, had me dressed in impossible rags from the warehouse, threatened me with ripping off the stripes. — ‘One-year volunteer’, said the numskull Colonel aloud doing his idiotic routine, ‘is something exalted, they are embryos of fame, military ranks, heroes. One-year volunteer Wohltat, having been promoted to Corporal after an exam he passed, volunteered for the front and captured fifteen enemies, and when turning them in he was ripped apart by a grenade. Then five minutes later came an order that one-year volunteer Wohltat was promoted to the rank of a cadet. Even you would have such a brilliant future, rise through the ranks, decorations waiting for you, your name would be entered into the golden book of the regiment.’”"

"„Voni ho měli i dřív,“ ozval se vandrák, „já pamatuju, že na Kladně bejval četnickým rytmistrem nějakej pan Rotter. Von nám najednou začal pěstovat tyhlety, jak jim říkají, policejní psy tý vlčí povahy, že všechno vyslídějí, když jsou vyučení. A měl ten pan rytmistr na Kladně těch svejch psích učeníků plnou prdel. Měl pro ně zvláštní domek, kde ti psi žili jako hrabata. A von si najednou vzpomněl, že bude s těma psema dělat pokusy na nás, na ubohejch vandrákách. Tak dal rozkaz, aby četnictvo po celým Kladencku sbíralo houževnatě vandráky a dodávalo je přímo do jeho rukouch. Já tak jednou štrekuju si to vod Lán a míhám se dost hluboko lesem, ale co platný, na tu hájovnu, kam jsem měl zamíříno, už jsem nedošel, už mě měli a vodváděli k panu rytmistrovi. A to si, lidičky, ani dobře nemůžete rozvážit a uvážit, co jsem u toho pana rytmistra s těma psema zkusil. Napřed mě dal všema vočichat, potom jsem musel lézt po žebříku, a když už jsem byl nahoře, tak pustili takovou jednu potvoru za mnou na žebřík a vona mě, bestie, vodnesla ze žebříku na zem, tam si na mne klekla a vrčela a cenila mně zuby do vobličeje. Potom tu potvoru vodvedli a mně řekli, abych se někde schoval, že můžu jít, kam chci. Vzal jsem to k údolí Kačáku do lesů, do jedný rokle, a za půl hodiny byli už dva ty vlčáci u mne, povalili mne, a zatímco jeden mne držel za krk, ten druhej běžel do Kladna, a za hodinu přišel sám pan rytmistr Rotter ke mně s četníky, zavolal na psa a dal mně pětikorunu a povolení, že můžu po celý dva dny na Kladencku žebrat. Ale kdepak já, běžel jsem, jako když mně hlavu zapálí, na Berounsko a víckrát jsem se na Kladencku neukázal. Tomu se vyhýbali všichni vandráci, poněvadž na všech dělal ten pan rytmistr svý pokusy. Von měl vůbec ty psy děsně rád. Vypravovali na četnických stanicích, že když von přišel na inspekci, tak kde viděl vlčáka, že tam vůbec inspekci nedělal a jen celej den s vachmistrem z radosti chlastal.“","""They had it before,"" said the wanderer, ""I remember that a Mr. Riot was a gendarmerie rhythm master in Kladno. Von suddenly started cultivating these, as they call them, police dogs of the wolf nature that they look after everything when they are trained. And the rhythm master in Kladno had the ass of his dog apprentices full. He had a special house for them, where the dogs lived like earls. And von suddenly remembered that he would experiment with those dogs on us, on poor bums. So he ordered the gendarmerie throughout the Kladno region to toughly collect bums and deliver them directly to his hands. So once I spray it in the waters of Lán and I run quite deep through the forest, but what a valid one, I didn't reach the hunting lodge where I was headed, they already had me and led me to the rhythm master. And you, folks, can't even consider and consider what I tried with that rhythm master with those dogs. First he gave me a sniff, then I had to climb a ladder, and when I was upstairs, they let one such monster behind me on the ladder and the beast, the beast, carried me from the ladder to the ground, where she knelt and growled and appreciated me. my teeth in my face. Then they led the monster and told me to hide somewhere that I could go where I wanted. I took it to the Kačák valley in the woods, to one of the ravines, and in half an hour the two wolves were with me, they knocked me down, and while one held me by the neck, the other ran to Kladno, and in an hour Mr. Rhythm Master Rotter came alone. to me with the gendarmes, he called the dog and gave me a five-crown and permission to beg for a whole two days in Kladno. But no, I ran, as if my head burned, to the Beroun region, and more than once I did not show up in the Kladno region. All the bums avoided this, because the rhythm master was experimenting on everyone. Von really liked the dogs at all. They told at the gendarme stations that when he came to the inspection, where he saw the wolfhound, that he had not inspected there at all, and that he had been drinking all day with the warden. ""","The police have collared a few of 'em for that sort of talk. Ah, the police are having it all their own way now."" The shepherd then strained the potatoes and poured sour sheep's milk into the dish.","“They used to be even before,” sounded up the wanderer, “I remember that in Kladno the State Police captain there used to be some Mister Rotter. Imagine, all of a sudden he started breeding these , what do they call them, police dogs with wolves’ disposition, since they manage to sniff everything out when they have been trained. And the Captain in Kladno had an assfull of those canine apprentices. He had a special little house for them where the dogs lived like counts. And he put it in his mind all of a sudden that he would conduct experiments with the dogs on us, the poor wanderers. So he gave an order for the state cops in the whole Kladno region to be collecting wanderers diligently and supplying them directly into his hands. This one time I am trekking from Lány and I’m zooming through pretty deep in the forest, but to no avail, I never reached the ranger’s house I aimed for then before they were already taking me to the Captain. And folks, you can’t even consider and imagine well enough what I suffered on account of those dogs at the Captain’s. First he let them all sniff me all over, then I had to climb up a ladder, and once I was on top he let one such miscreant loose and after me, and he, the beast, carried me from the ladder to the ground, there he kneeled on top of me and was growling and baring its teeth in my face. Then they led the creature away and told me to hide somewhere, that I could go anywhere I wanted to. I took off into the forests in the Kacák valley, into a ravine, and in half an hour two German Shepards were already by my side, knocked me over, and while one was holding me by the neck the other ran to Kladno, and in one hour Captain Rotter himself came to me with the State policemen, called the dog and gave me a five-crown coin and an authorization to beg in the Kladno region for two whole days. But as for me, forget it. I ran to the Beroun region as if they had set my head on fire and I never showed myself in Kladensko again. That region was being avoided by all wanderers because this Mister Captain was conducting his experiments on all of them. He really just loved those dogs. They used to say around the State Police stations that when he would come to conduct an inspection, then wherever he’d see a German Shepard he didn’t even bother to inspect anything, and out of the sheer joy of it he’d booze it up with the officer of the watch all day.”"

"O tom hejtmanovi Adamičkovi se pak říkalo, že má smysl pro spravedlnost, milý kamaráde, tak ho poslali do pole a namístě něho přišel sem major Wenzl. A to byl čertův syn, pokud se týkalo národnostních štvanic, a ten zaťal tipec fénrichovi Dauerlingovi. Major Wenzl má za manželku Češku a má největší strach z národnostních sporů. Když před lety sloužil jako hejtman v Kutné Hoře, vynadal jednou v opilosti v jednom hotelu vrchnímu, že je česká pakáž. Upozorňuji přitom, že ve společnosti mluvil major Wenzl výhradně česky, stejně jako ve své domácnosti, a že jeho synové studují česky. Slovo padlo, a už to bylo v místních novinách a nějaký poslanec interpeloval chování hejtmana Wenzla v hotelu ve vídeňském parlamentě. Měl z toho Wenzl velké nepříjemnosti, poněvadž to bylo právě v době povolení parlamentem vojenské předlohy, a teď jim do toho vleze takový ožralý hejtman Wenzl z Kutné Hory.","The governor Adamička was then said to have a sense of justice, dear friend, so they sent him to the field and Major Wenzl came here instead. And that was the devil's son, as far as the national fights were concerned, and he was a tipper to Fenrich Dauerling. Major Wenzl has a Czech wife and is most afraid of ethnic disputes. When he served as governor in Kutná Hora years ago, he once drunk a drunk in a hotel in a hotel that is Czech packaging. I would like to point out that Major Wenzl spoke exclusively Czech in the company, as well as in his own household, and that his sons study Czech. The word fell, and it was already in the local paper, and a member of parliament intercepted President Wenzl's behavior at a hotel in the Viennese parliament. Wenzl was very uncomfortable about this, because it was at the time of the parliament's approval of the military model, and now such a drunken governor Wenzl from Kutná Hora can get into it.","I daresay that before he joined the army he was a young man with ideals, a fair-haired cherub, kind and gentle to everyone, and always taking the part of the under-dog.","“It was then being said about this Captain Adamicka that he had a sense for justice, dear pal, so they sent him into the field and in his place came Major Wenzl. And he was a son of a demon when it came to ethnic baiting and manhunts, and he sure nipped Warrant Officer Dauerling’s bud. Major Wenzl has a Czech woman for a wife and his biggest fear is the fear of nationality disputes. When he served as a captain in Kutná Hora, Mining Mount town, years ago, at one time while inebriated at a hotel he cussed the head waiter saying that he’s one of the filthy Czech rabble. Let me also bring to your attention at the same time that when in company, Major Wenzl spoke Czech exclusively, just as he did in his own household, and that his sons were studying in Czech. No sooner was the word uttered than it was in the local newspaper and some deputy was already demanding in the Viennese parliament that the government explain Major Wenzl’s behavior at the hotel and its own position regarding it. Major Wenzl had great difficulties on account of it, because it happened just at the time of the military’s budget proposal being up for a vote in the parliament, and now such a one as the drunken Captain Wenzl from Kutná Hora mucked it up for them."

Tomorrow we’ll be hauling him to Písek, to the County Chief. Criminology depends on smarts and kindness. You saw how I drowned him in an avalanche of questions. Who would have thought it of him.

"„Ano, pane plukovníku,“ odpověděl nadporučík Lukáš a pokračoval ve čtení: „Vedení války vyžaduje součinnost všech vrstev obyvatelstva rakousko-uherského mocnářství. Chceme-li míti pod střechou bezpečí státu, všechny národy musí podporovati se navzájem a záruka naší budoucnosti je právě v té spontánní úctě, kterou jeden národ má před druhým. Největší oběti našich čackých vojínů na frontách, kde oni neustále postupují kupředu, nebyly by možny, kdyby týl, ona zásobovací i politická tepna našich slavných armád, nebyl sjednoceným, kdyby vyskytovaly se v zádech naší armády živly rozbíjející jednolitost státu a svou agitací a zlomyslností podrývaly autoritu státního celku a zaváděly v souručenství národů naší říše zmatky. Nemůžeme se v této dějinné chvíli mlčky dívati na hrstku lidí, kteří by chtěli se pokoušet z nacionálních místních důvodů rušit sjednocenou práci a zápas všech národů této říše o spravedlivé potrestání těch bídáků, kteří na říši naši bez příčiny napadli, aby ji zbavili veškerých kulturních i civilizačních statků. Nemůžeme mlčky opominout tyto hnusné zjevy výbuchů chorobné duše, která touží jen po rozražení jednomyslnosti v srdcích národů. Měli jsme již několikrát příležitost upozornit v našem časopise na ten zjev, jak vojenské úřady jsou nuceny se vší přísností zakročiti proti těm jednotlivcům od českých pluků, kteří nedbajíce slavné tradice plukovní, rozsívají svým nesmyslným řáděním v našich maďarských městech zlobu proti celému českému národu, který jako celek není ničím vinen a který vždy pevně stál za zájmy této říše, o čemž svědčí celá řada vynikajících českých vojevůdců, z nichž vzpomínáme slavné postavy maršálka Radeckého a jiných obranců rakousko-uherského mocnářství. Proti těmto světlým zjevům stojí několik darebáků zpustlé české lůzy, kteří použili světové války, aby se dobrovolně přihlásili do vojska a mohli uvésti zmatek v jednomyslnost národů monarchie, nezapomínajíce přitom na své nejnižší pudy. Upozornili jsme již jednou na řádění pluku No… v Debrecíně, jehož výtržnosti byly přetřásány i odsouzeny peštskou sněmovnou a jehož plukovní prapor později na frontě byl – Konfiskováno – Kdo má na svědomí ten ohavný hřích? – Konfiskováno – Kdo hnal české vojáky – Konfiskováno – Co si troufá cizota v naší maďarské vlasti, o tom svědčí nejlépe případ v Királyhidě, maďarské výspě nad Litavou. K jaké národnosti patřili vojáci z nedalekého vojenského tábora v Brucku nad Litavou, kteří přepadli a ztrýznili tamějšího obchodníka pana Gyulu Kákonyie? Jest rozhodně povinností úřadů vyšetřiti tento zločin a optati se vojenského velitelství, které jistě již se touto aférou zabývá, jakou úlohu v tom bezpříkladném štvaní proti příslušníkům Uherského království hraje nadporučík Lukasch, jehož jméno uvádí se po městě ve spojitosti s událostmi posledních dnů, jak nám bylo sděleno naším místním dopisovatelem, který sebral již bohatý materiál o celé aféře, která v dnešní vážné době přímo křičí. Čtenáři Pester Lloydu jistě se zájmem budou sledovati vývin vyšetřování a neopomeneme je ujistit, že je blíže seznámíme s touto událostí eminentní důležitosti. Současně však očekáváme úřední zprávu o királyhidském zločinu, spáchaném na maďarském obyvatelstvu. Že se věcí bude zabývat peštská sněmovna, je nabíledni, aby nakonec se ukázalo jasně, že čeští vojáci, projíždějící Uherským královstvím na front, nesmí považovat zemi koruny svatého Štěpána, jako by ji měli v pachtu. Jestli pak někteří příslušníci toho národa, který v Királyhidě tak pěkně reprezentoval souručenství všech národů tohoto mocnářství, ještě dnes nechápou situaci, ať zůstanou hezky zticha, neboť ve válce takové lidi kulka, provaz, kriminál a bajonet naučí již poslouchat a podřídit se nejvyšším zájmům naší společné vlasti.“","""Yes, Colonel,"" Lieutenant Luke replied, continuing to read: ""Warfare requires the cooperation of all sections of the population of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. If we want to have the security of the state under the roof, all nations must support each other, and the guarantee of our future is precisely the spontaneous respect that one nation has over another. The greatest victims of our Čak soldiers on the fronts, where they are constantly advancing, would not be possible if the rear, the supply and political arteries of our famous armies, were not united, if there were elements in the back of our army breaking the unity of the state and undermining their agitation and malice. authority of the state and introduced confusion in the unity of the peoples of our empire. At this historic moment, we cannot silently look at a handful of people who, for national local reasons, would like to try to disrupt the united work and struggle of all the nations of this empire for the just punishment of those poor people who attacked our empire without cause to rid it of all cultural and civilization goods. We cannot silently ignore these disgusting manifestations of the bursts of a sick soul that longs only to break the unanimity in the hearts of the nations. We have already had several opportunities to draw attention in our magazine to the phenomenon of how the military authorities are forced to take all action against those individuals from Czech regiments who, disregarding the famous regimental traditions, spread anger against the whole Czech nation with their senseless rampage in our Hungarian cities. as a whole he is not guilty of anything and who has always stood firmly behind the interests of this empire, as evidenced by a number of excellent Czech military leaders, from whom we remember the famous figures of Marshal Radecký and other defenders of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Against these bright phenomena, there are several villains of a desolate Czech mob who used the world wars to volunteer for the army and be able to bring confusion into the unanimity of the nations of the monarchy, not forgetting their lowest instincts. We have already drawn attention once to the rampage of the No… regiment in Debrecen, whose riots were shaken and condemned by the Pest Chamber of Deputies and whose regimental battalion was later at the front - Confiscated - Who is to blame for this heinous sin? - Confiscated - Who drove Czech soldiers - Confiscated - What dares foreign in our Hungarian homeland is best evidenced by the case in Királyhida, the Hungarian island over Lithuania. What was the nationality of the soldiers from the nearby military camp in Bruck nad Litavou, who raided and tortured the local merchant Mr. Gyul Kajčyie? It is definitely the duty of the authorities to investigate this crime and to ask the military headquarters, which is certainly already dealing with this affair, what role Lieutenant Lukasch, whose name appears in the city in connection with the events of recent days, plays in the unprecedented harassment of the Kingdom of Hungary. was communicated by our local correspondent, who has already gathered a wealth of material about the whole affair, which is screaming right now. Pester Lloyd's readers will certainly follow the development of the investigation with interest, and we will not fail to assure them that we will acquaint them more closely with this event of eminent importance. At the same time, however, we expect an official report on the Királyhid crime committed against the Hungarian population. The Pest House is going to make it clear that Czech soldiers passing through the Kingdom of Hungary at the front must not consider the land of St. Stephen's Crown as having it in their leash. If some members of the nation, which in Királyhida so nicely represented the unity of all the nations of this monarchy, still do not understand the situation, let them remain quietly, because in war such people bullet, rope, crime and bayonet will learn to listen and submit to the highest interests of our common homeland. """,""" Yes, sir,"" replied the lieutenant, and went on reading : ""The conduct of the war demands the cooperation of all classes in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. If we desire to attain the security of the state, all the nations must support each other and the guarantee for our future consists precisely in this mutual and spontaneous respect. The enormous sacrifices of our gallant troops at the front, where they are continually advancing, would not be possible, if the home front were not united, but harboured elements inimical to the harmonious structure of the state, undermining its authority by their malicious activities and thus threatening the joint interests of the nations in our Empire. At this historical juncture we cannot view in silence the handful of people who would like to impair the unified effort and struggle of all the nations in this Empire. We cannot silently overlook these odious signs of a diseased mentality which aims solely at destroying the unanimity in the hearts of the nations. Several times already we have had occasion to point out how the military authorities are compelled to adopt the severest measures against individuals in the Czech regiments who, heedless of glorious regimental traditions, by their disgraceful conduct in our Magyar towns have spread ill-feeling against the Czech nation which, in its entirety, is not to blame and, indeed, has always been closely identitied with the interests of this Empire, as is attested by the many distinguished Czech military leaders, such as the renowned Marshal Radetzky and other defenders of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. These noble figures are being besmirched by a few blackguards from the Czech rabble who are taking advantage of war conditions to enlist in the army and then imperil the united front among the nations in the monarchy, at the same time allowing their lowest instincts to run riot. We have already drawn attention to the disgraceful behaviour of regiment No. - at Debreczin, whose outrageous conduct formed the subject of debate and condemnation in the parliament at Budapest and whose regimental colours subsequently, at the front, were . . . (Deleted by censor). At whose door is this revolting offence to be laid . . . (Deleted by censor)? Who incited the Czech troops to . . . (Deleted by censor)? Some idea of the lengths to which the foreign elements in our midst will go, can be best inferred from the recent incidents at Kiraly-Hida. What is the nationality of those troops from the Bruck military camp close at hand who attacked and ill-treated Mr. Gyula Kâkonyi, a tradesman in that town? It is obviously the bounden duty of the authorities to investigate this outrage and to ask the military command, which has doubtless already started making inquiries, what part in this unexampled bullying of Magyar citizens was played by Lieutenant Lukash, whose name is being mentioned in the town in connection with the recent disgraceful episode, as we are informed by a local correspondent who has already collected ample evidence on this matter which, at so grave an epoch as to-day, clamours for redress. We are sure that readers of the Pester Lloyd will follow with interest the further course of investigation and we shall certainly not fail to keep them acquainted with a matter of such eminent significance. At the same time, however, we await an official report on the outrage at Kiraly-Hida perpetrated against a Magyar citizen. It is obvious that the parliament at Budapest will give the matter its closest attention, in order to make it plain that Czech troops, passing through the kingdom of Hungary on their way to the front, must not be allowed to treat the country of St. Stephen's crown as if it were their vassal. If any members of this nation which at Kiraly-Hida made such an exhibition of the unified spirit prevailing among all nations in this monarchy, still do not realize how things are, they had better keep very quiet about it , for in wartime it is the bullet, the rope, the jail and the bayonet which will teach such persons to obey and to subordinate themselves to this highest interest of our joint country.""","“Yes Colonel, Sir,” answered Senior Lieutenant Lukáš and continued reading: “Being engaged in a war demands collaboration of all strata of society of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. If we want to have the safety of the state secured under its roof, all its nationalities must support one another, and in the spontaneous respect which one nation enjoys facing another is precisely the guarantee of our future. The greatest sacrifices of our doughty GIs at the fronts, where they are ceaselessly stepping forward, would not be possible if the rear, the supply and political artery of our glorious armies, were not united, if in the back of our army there were occurring elements shattering the unity of the state and through their agitation and ill-will were undermining the authority of the state as a whole and were injecting confusion into the alliance of the nationalities of our Empire. We cannot, in this historical moment, be reticent while watching a handful of people who would want to try, motivated by nationalistic local reasons, to interfere with the united work and struggle of all the nationalities of this Empire to justly punish those scoundrels who attacked our Realm without a cause in order to rid Austria of all cultural and civilizing possessions. We cannot, saying nothing, overlook these disgusting phenomena of outbursts of a sick soul that desires only the breaching of unanimity in the hearts of our peoples. We have already several times had the opportunity in our magazine to bring attention to the phenomenon of how the military authorities are forced to act with all their strictness against those individuals from Czech regiments who, disregarding the glorious regimental traditions, sow, by their senseless rioting in our Hungarian towns, anger against the whole Czech nation that as a whole is guilty of nothing and that has always stood firm behind the interests of the Realm, of which testifies a whole number of outstanding Czech military leaders, from among whom we remind you of the glorious figure of Marshall Radecký and other defenders of the Austro- Hungarian monarchy. Standing out in contrast against these bright apparitions are several rascals of the debauched Czech riff-raff, who used the world war to voluntarily sign up with the army to be able to introduce confusion into the unanimity of the peoples of the Monarchy, while not forgetting their own lowest instincts. We have already once brought attention to the rioting of the Regiment No. . . . in Debrecín, whose breaches of peace have been addressed and condemned by the Pest Assembly and whose Regimental colors were later, at the front - STRUCK BY CENSOR - Who has this hideous sin on his conscience? - STRUCK BY CENSOR - Who drove Czech soldiers - STRUCK BY CENSOR - What the foreign element dares in our Hungarian homeland is best evidenced by the case in Királihyda, the Hungarian outpost on the Litava. What nationality were the soldiers from the nearby military camp in Bruck an der Leitha who assaulted and tormented the local merchant, Gyulu Kákonyi? It is definitely the duty of the authorities to investigate this crime and ask the military headquarters that is certainly dealing with this affair already, what role in this unprecedented instigating against the members of the Hungarian kingdom is played by Lieutenant Lukasch whose name is being mentioned in the town in connection with the events of the past several days, as we were informed by our local correspondent who has already collected rich material about the whole affair that is a screaming outrage in today’s serious times. The readers of Pester Lloyd surely will be following the unfolding of the investigation with interest and we won’t fail to assure them that we will acquaint them more closely with this event of eminent importance. Concurrently, however, we are expecting the official report about the Királihyda crime committed against the Hungarian population. It is as clear as day that the Pest Assembly will be discussing the matter, so that in the end it will be revealed and established brilliantly that Czech soldiers riding to the front through the Hungarian Kingdom must not consider the land of the crown of Saint Stephen, as if they had it on a lease. Should then some members of the people, whom the alliance of all the nationalities of this Monarchy represented in Királihyda so nicely, still not understand the situation today, let them remain nice and quiet because in the war a bullet, rope, slammer and bayonet will teach such people to listen and subordinate themselves to the highest interests of our common homeland.”"
"Plukovník smutně potřásl hlavou: „Dnes už není mezi námi to pravé kamarádství. Dřív, pamatuji se, že každý z nás, důstojníků, snažil se v kasině přispět něčím k zábavě. Jeden, pamatuji se, nějaký nadporučík Dankl, ten se svlékl do naha, lehl si na podlahu, zastrčil si do zadnice ocas ze slanečka a představoval nám mořskou pannu. Jiný zas, poručík Schleisner, uměl střihat ušima a řičet jako hřebec, napodobovat mňoukání koček a bzučení čmeláka. Pamatuji se také na hejtmana Skodayho. Ten vždy, když jsme chtěli, přivedl do kasina holky, byly to tři sestry, a měl je nacvičené jako psy.","The colonel shook his head sadly, ""Today is not the right friendship between us. Earlier, I remember that each of us officers tried to make a living at the casino. One, I remember, a lieutenant Dankl, who stripped naked, lay down on the floor, tucked his tail in the ass of a herring, and introduced us to a mermaid. Another, Lieutenant Schleisner, could cut his ears and shout like a stallion, imitating the meowing of cats and the buzzing of a bumblebee. I also remember President Skoday. Whenever we wanted, he brought girls to the casino, they were three sisters, and he had them trained like dogs.","The colonel shook his head sadly : ""Nowadays there's no real comradeship among us. I can remember the time when every officer tried to do his bit toward amusing the company. There was one, I remember, a Lieutenant Dankl, he used to strip himself naked, lie on the floor, stick a herring's tail to his backside and pretend to be a mermaid. Then there was another chap, a Lieutenant Schleisner, who could waggle his ears and neigh like a stallion, besides imitating the miaowing of a cat and the buzzing of a bluebottle. And then I remember Captain Skoday. He always used to bring some girls to the officers' club whenever we wanted him to. They were three sisters, and he'd got 'em trained like dogs.","The Colonel sadly shook his head: “Nowadays there isn’t the right kind, genuine camaraderie among us anymore. In earlier days, I remember, each of us officers would try to contribute something to the merriment at the officers’ club. One, as I remember, some Lieutenant Dankl, he stripped himself naked, lay on the floor, stuck the tail from a salted herring in his butt and presented to us a demonstration of a mermaid. Another one, on the other hand, Lieutenant Schleisner, knew how to wiggle his ears and whinny like a stallion, imitate the meowing of cats and humming of a bumble-bee. I also remember one Captain Skoday. He, whenever we wanted, always brought girls to the officers’ club, they were three sisters, and he had them trained like dogs."

"„Zajisté, pane vachmajstr, jako infanterista.“ A zas se klidně jako dřív díval Švejk na strážmistra, který sebou vrtěl radostí a nemohl se již zdržet, aby to rychle nezanesl do raportu. Zavolal závodčího, aby Švejka odvedl, a doplnil svůj raport: „Jeho plán byl tento: Vplíživ se v řady 91. pěš. pluku, chtěl se ihned přihlásit na frontu a při nejbližší příležitosti dostat se do Ruska, neboť postřehl, že zpáteční cesta při bdělosti orgánů jest jinak nemožnou. Že by u 91. pěš. pluku mohl výborně prosperovat, jest plně pochopitelné, neboť dle jeho doznání, přiznal se po delším křížovém výslechu, že prodělal již v roce 1910 celé císařské manévry v okolí Písku jako infanterista. Z toho jest vidět, že jest ve svém oboru velice schopný. Podotýkám ještě, že sebraná obvinění jsou výsledkem mého systému křížového výslechu.“","""Certainly, Mr. Vachmaster, as an infantryman.""

That at the 91st Infantry. the regiment could prosper well, it is fully understandable, because according to his confession, he confessed after a long cross-examination that he underwent in 1910 the entire imperial maneuvers around Písek as an infantryman.

It can be readily understood that he would get on well in the 91st regiment, for on his own admission, which was extracted from him after a lengthy cross-examination, he went right through the imperial manœuvres in the neighbourhood of Pisek, as an infantryman, as far back as 1910. From that it is clear that he is extremely efficient in his own special branch. I may add that all the items of incriminating evidence were the result of my system of cross-examination.","“Of course Watch Sergeant, Sir, as an infantryman.” And again, as calmly as before, Švejk was looking at the Station Chief who was fidgeting with joy and could not hold himself back recording it quickly in the report. He called the Watch Sergeant to take Švejk away, and added to his report: “His plan was this: Having snuck into the ranks of the 91st Regiment he wanted to volunteer immediately for the front, and at the nearest opportunity to get to Russia, as he had noticed that given the vigilance of the authorities the return journey was otherwise impossible. The expectation that he would prosper excellently with the 91st Regiment is altogether understandable, since according to his confession he admitted after a rather long cross-examination that in 1910 he had already gone through the entire Imperial maneuvers in the vicinity of Písek as an infantryman. One can see from this that he is very capable in his area of expertise. I would like to point out also that the compiled charges are a result of my system of cross-examination.”"
