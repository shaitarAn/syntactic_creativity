"Je přirozeno, že nyní také v jiných státech se ozvalo volání po řádném a povinném školství pro Mloky pod dozorem státnim. Došlo k tomu postupně ve všech námořních zemích (ovšem s výjimkou Velké Británie), a protože tyto mločí školy nebyly zatíženy starými klasickými tradicemi škol lidských a mohly tedy užít všech nejnovějších metod psychotechniky, technologické výchovy, předvojenského výcviku a jiných posledních vymožeností pedagogických, vyvinulo se z nich záhy to nejmodernější a vědecky nejpokročilejší školství na světě, jež právem bylo předmětem závisti všech pedagogů i školáků lidských.","It is natural that now in other states there has been a call for proper and compulsory education for Newts under state supervision. This has happened gradually in all maritime countries (except the UK), and as these salamander schools have not been burdened by the old classical traditions of human schools and have therefore been able to benefit from all the latest methods of psychotechnics, technology education, pre-military training and other recent pedagogical conveniences, of them, soon the most modern and scientifically advanced education in the world, which was rightly the envy of all educators and human schoolchildren.","It was now a matter of course that other countries would also declare their belief in making the newts have a proper, state supervised education. One by one, all the seafaring nations declared themselves for it (with the exception of Great Britain, of course); and because these schools for newts were not burdened with the classical traditions of schools for human children, and were able to make use of all the latest methods in psychotechnology, technical education, pre-military exercises and other educational innovations, these schools quickly evolved into the most modern and scientifically advanced educational system in the world, envied by teachers and students everywhere.","Naturally the call for regularised and compulsory education for the Newts under state supervision was now also raised in other countries.

"A dost. Toho dne Kandong Bandoeng odplula do Padangu. Z Padangu poslal kapitán J. van Toch své společnosti v Amsterodamu balíček pojištěný na tisíc dvě stě liber sterlingů. A současně telegrafickou žádost o roční dovolenou. Naléhavé zdravotní důvody a tak dále. Potom se potloukal po Padangu, až našel osobu, kterou hledal. Byl to divoch z Bornea, Dajak, kterého si občas najímali angličtí cestující jako lovce žraloků, pro tu podívanou, neboť Dajak pracoval ještě postaru, ozbrojen jenom dlouhým nožem. Byl to patrně lidožrout, ale měl svou pevnou taxu: pět liber za žraloka, krom stravy. Ostatně byl na něho hrozný pohled, neboť měl na obou rukou, na prsou i stehnech kůži sedřenou od žraločí kůže a nos i uši vyzdobené žraločími zuby. Říkalo se mu Shark.","Enough. That day, Kandong Bandoeng sailed to Padang. From Padang, Captain J. van Toch sent his company in Amsterdam a package insured for one thousand two hundred pounds sterling. And at the same time a telegraphic request for annual leave. Urgent medical reasons and so on. Then he wandered around Padang until he found the person he was looking for. He was a savage from Borneo, Dajak, who was sometimes hired by English passengers as shark hunters, for the sight, as Dajak was still working as an old man, armed only with a long knife. He was probably a cannibal, but he had a fixed tax: five pounds for a shark, in addition to food. After all, he had a terrible look at him, for he had skin on his hands, chest, and thighs scraped from shark's skin, and his nose and ears adorned with shark's teeth. His name was Shark.","And that was it. That day the Kandong Bandoeng sailed into Padang. In Padang Captain J. van Toch sent his firm in Amsterdam a parcel insured for a thousand two hundred pounds sterling. At the same time he sent a telegram asking for his annual leave. Urgent medical reasons, and so on. Then he wandered around Padang until he found the man he was looking for. This was a native of Borneo, a Dayak who English tourists would sometimes hire as a shark hunter just for the show; as this Dayak still worked in the old way, armed with no more than a long knife. He was clearly a cannibal but he had his fixed terms: five pounds for a shark plus his board. He was also quite startling in appearance, as both hands, his breast and his legs were heavily scarred from contact with shark skin and his nose and ears were decorated with shark teeth. He was known as Shark.","That was all. That day the Kandong Bandoeng sailed for Padang. From Padang Captain J. van Toch sent a package to his company in Amsterdam, a package insured for £1,200 sterling. And simultaneously he telegraphed a request for a year’s leave. Urgent reasons of health and that sort of thing. Then he knocked about Padang until he found whoever he had been looking for. He was a savage from Borneo, a Dayak whom English tourists would occasionally hire as a shark hunter, just in order to watch him at work, for the Dayak still operated in the old way, armed only with a long knife. He was evidently a cannibal but he had his fixed scale of charges: five pounds per shark, plus board. Otherwise he was hideous to behold, for his skin had been scraped off both his arms, his chest and his thighs by sharkskin, and his nose and ears were adorned with sharks’ teeth. Everyone called him Shark."

"""Přes veškerou kohoutí pýchu,"" pokračuje Charles J. Powell, ""příroda udělila u většiny živočišných rodů životní převahu spíše samicím. Samci jsou tu pro svou rozkoš a proto, aby zabíjeli, jsou nadutými a načepýřenými jedinci, kdežto samice představují sám rod v jeho síle a ustálených ctnostech. U Andriase (a částečně u člověka) je poměr podstatně jiný, vytvořením samčí pospolitosti a solidarity nabývá samec zřejmé biologické převahy a určuje vývoj druhu v míře daleko větší než samice. Snad právě pro ten význačně samčí směr vývoje se tak silně uplatňuje u Andriase technické, tedy typicky mužské nadání. Andrias je rozený technik se sklonem k hromadnému podnikání, tyto sekundární mužské pohlavní znaky, totiž technický talent a smysl pro organizaci, se v něm přímo před našima očima rozvíjejí tak rychle a úspěšně, že bychom museli mluvit o přírodním divu, kdybychom nevěděli, jak mohutným životním činitelem jsou právě sexuální determinanty. Andrias Scheuchzeri jest animal faber a v době možná už dohledné překoná technicky i sama člověka, a to vše jenom silou přírodního faktu, že vytvořil čistou samčí pospolitost.""","""Despite all the pride of the rooster,"" continues Charles J. Powell, ""nature has given most animal genera a predominance of life to females. In Andrias (and partly in humans) the relationship is substantially different; Andrias is a born technician with a penchant for mass business, these secondary male sexual characteristics, namely technical talent and a sense of organization, develop in him so quickly and successfully that we would have to talking about a natural wonder if we didn't know how powerful sexual determinants are in life Andrias Scheuchzeri is an animal faber and technically, he will surely surpass man himself, all by the force of the natural fact that he has created a pure male community. ""","“However vainly the cock might crow,” Charles J. Powell continued, “it is to the female that in, most species, nature has given the dominant role in life. The male is there for his own passion and to kill; he is pompous and arrogant, while the female represents the species in all its strength and lasting nobility. In the case of Andrias (and often in the case of man) the relationship is fundamentally different; by the creation of a masculine society and solidarity the male acquires clear biological dominance and determines how the species will develop to a far greater extent than the female. It may well be because of this marked male input to the direction of development that Andrias has so excelled in technical matters, which are talents typical of the male. Andrias is by nature a technologist and tends towards group activities; these secondary features of the male, by which I mean a talent for technology and a flair for organisation, has, before our very eyes, developed with such speed and such success that we would be compelled to speak of a miracle were we not aware of what a powerful force in life sexual determination is. Andrias Scheuchzeri is animal faber, and it is even possible that he will one day surpass man himself given enough time. All this is the result of one fact of nature; that they have created a society that is purely male.”","‘In spite of all the cockerel’s pride,’ Charles J. Powell continues, ‘nature has, in the majority of animal species, tended to endow the female with vital superiority. The male exists for his own pleasure and in order to kill; he is a conceited and puffed-up individual, whereas the female represents the species in all its vigour and established virtues. In the case of Andrias (and partly also in Man) the relationship is substantially different; through the establishment of male collectivity and solidarity the male clearly acquires a biological superiority and determines the development of the species to a far greater extent than the female. Perhaps it is just this significant male trend in his evolution that makes Andrias display such engineering talent, i.e. a typically male talent. Andrias is a born technician with an inclination towards large-scale undertakings; these secondary sexual characteristics of the male, i.e. technical talent and a gift for organisation, are developing in him before our very eyes, and with such rapidity and success that we would regard it as a miracle of nature if we did not know that the most powerful vital agents are just these sexual determinants. Andrias Scheuchzer is an animal faber and in technical achievement it may well surpass even Man in the foreseeable future - and that only as a result of the natural circumstances that he has created a purely male community.’"

"Ačkoliv otřesy země v Kiangsu svým rozsahem daleko překročily pohromu v Louisianě, věnovalo se jim celkem málo pozornosti, neboť na katastrofy v Číně je svět už zvyklý a nezáleží tam, jak se zdá, na nějakém tom miliónu životů, mimoto bylo vědecky jasno, že jde o pouhé tektonické zemětřesení, související s hlubinnou mořskou brázdou u souostroví Riukiu a Filipín. Tři dny nato však zaznamenaly evropské seizmografy nové otřesy země, jejichž střed byl někde u Kapverdských ostrovů. Podrobnější zprávy hlásily, že těžkým zemětřesením bylo postiženo pobřeží Senegambie jižně od St. Louis. Mezi místy Lampul a Mboro vznikla hluboká propadlina zaplavená mořem a postupující na Merinaghen až po wady Dimarské. Podle očitých svědků vyrazil za strašného rachotu ze země sloup ohně a páry, rozmetávající v dalekém okruhu písek a kamení, nato bylo slyšet jek moře, které se valilo do otevřené propadliny. Ztráty na životech nejsou značné.","Although the earthquakes in Kiangsu far outweighed the disaster in Louisiana, they received little attention, as the world is already accustomed to disasters in China and no million lives seem to matter, and it was scientifically clear that about a mere tectonic earthquake, related to a deep sea furrow near the Riukiu archipelago and the Philippines. Three days later, however, European seismographs experienced new earthquakes in the center, somewhere near the Cape Verde Islands. More detailed reports have reported that a severe earthquake has hit the coast of Senegambia south of St. Petersburg. Louis. Between Lampul and Mboro, a deep depression formed by the sea and advancing on Merinaghen to the Wadi of Dimar. According to eyewitnesses, a column of fire and steam shot out of the ground at a terrible rumble, scattering sand and stones in a distant circle, then a sea howl rolled into the open depression. The loss of life is not significant.","Although the earthquake in Kiangsu was far more extensive than the disaster in Louisiana it attracted little attention in the world press because everyone was used to catastrophes happening in China and the loss of some million lives did not seem very important; and besides, it was scientifically clear that it was only a tectonic earthquake to do with the deep sea trench near the Riukiu and Philippine archipelagoes. But three days later, seismographs in Europe registered new tremors centred somewhere near the Cape Verde Islands. More detailed reports stated that the coast of Senegambia, south of St. Louis, had been hit by a serious earthquake. A deep fissure appeared between Lampul and Mboro, allowing the sea to gush in through the Merinagh and as far as Wadi Dimar. Eyewitnesses said that a column of fire and steam had erupted from the ground with a terrible noise, hurling sand and stones for miles around; and then there was the sound of the sea as it rushed into the gulf that had been opened up. There was no significant loss of life.","Although the scale of the earthquake in Kiangsu greatly exceeded the disaster in Louisiana it received little attention on the whole: the world was accustomed to catastrophes in China and, so it seemed, the odd million lives did not matter greatly there. Besides, it was scientifically obvious that this was a mere tectonic earthquake, associated with a deep ocean trench near the Riukiu and Philippine archipelagos. Three days later, however, European seismographs registered renewed tremors with an epicentre somewhere near the Cape Verde Islands. More detailed reports stated that a severe earthquake had hit the Senegambian coast south of St Luis. A deep subsidence had occurred between the towns of Lampul and Mboro; this was flooded by the sea which penetrated as far as Merinaghen and the Dimara wadis. According to eyewitness accounts a column of fire and steam had burst from the ground, accompanied by a frightful rumble, flinging sand and stones over a wide radius; after that the sea was heard rushing into the opened rift. Loss of life was not heavy."

To make matters worse, at just that moment the silent Mr Povondra appeared in the door with a jug of beer, raising scandalised eyebrows as he watched the captain’s unseemly behaviour."
"Noc nato se ozval rozhlasem chraptivý, hněvivý a těžký hlas Chief Salamandra: ""Hallo, vy lidé! Ať tedy Anglie nedělá hlouposti! Bude-li nám otravovat vodu, budeme my vám otravovat vzduch.

"První zvláštní vydání neworleanských novin vyšla ovšem už po čtvrté hodině ranní, s pokračujícím dnem přibývalo nových vydání a podrobností, k osmé hodině ráno už noviny přinášely fotografie postiženého území a mapy nové mořské zátoky. O půl deváté otiskovaly interview s vynikajícím seizmologem memphiské univerzity dr. Wilburem R. Brownellem o příčinách otřesů země v Louisianě. Prozatím nemůžeme činit konečných závěrů, prohlásil věhlasný učenec, ale zdá se, že tyto otřesy nemají co dělat s vulkanickou činností dosud intenzívně živou v středomexickém sopečném pásmu, ležícím přímo proti postiženému území. Dnešní zemětřesení zdá se být spíše původu tektonického, to jest je způsobeno tlakem horských mas: z jedné strany Skalistých hor a Sierry Madre, z druhé strany pohoří Appalachianského na rozsáhlou propadlinu Mexického zálivu, jehož pokračováním je široká nížina při dolním toku Mississippi. Trhlina vybíhající nyní z Vermillion Bay je jenom nový a poměrně nepatrný zlom, drobná epizoda v geologickém propadání, jímž vznikl Mexický záliv a moře Karibské i s věncem Velkých a Malých Antil, tímto zbytkem někdejšího souvislého horského pásma. Není pochyby, že středoamerické sedání bude postupovat dál, novými otřesy, zlomy a trhlinami, nemůžeme vyloučit, že trhlina vermillionská je pouhou ouverturou k oživenému tektonickému procesu, jehož střed je právě v Mexickém zálivu, v tom případě můžeme být svědky obrovských geologických katastrof, jimiž by se mohla stát téměř pětina Spojených států mořským dnem. Zato však, kdyby k tomu došlo, mohli bychom s jistou pravděpodobností očekávat, že se počne zvedat mořské dno v okolí Antil nebo ještě východněji, v místech, kde starý mýtus hledá ponořenou Atlantidu.","However, the first special issue of the New Orleans newspaper was published after four o'clock in the morning, and as the day went on, new issues and details were added, and at eight o'clock in the morning the newspaper brought photos of the affected area and maps of the new sea bay. At half past eight they published an interview with an excellent seismologist at the University of Memphis, Dr. Wilbur R. Brownell on the causes of the earthquakes in Louisiana. So far, we cannot draw definitive conclusions, the famous scholar said, but these shocks do not seem to have anything to do with volcanic activity still intensely alive in the Central Mexican volcanic zone, lying directly opposite the affected area. Today's earthquake seems to be more of tectonic origin, that is, caused by mountain pressure: on the one hand, the Rockies and the Sierra Madre, on the other, the Appalachian Mountains on the vast depression of the Gulf of Mexico, which continues into a wide lowland in the lower Mississippi. The rift now extending from Vermillion Bay is just a new and relatively minor fault, a minor episode in the geological plunge that created the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, with the Wreath of the Greater Antilles, this remnant of a former contiguous mountain range. There is no doubt that the Central American settlement will continue, with new tremors, fractures and cracks, we cannot rule out that the Vermillion rift is a mere overture to a revived tectonic process centered in the Gulf of Mexico, in which case we may witness huge geological catastrophes almost a fifth of the United States could become a seabed. But if that happened, we could probably expect the seabed to rise around the Antilles, or even further east, in places where the old myth seeks submerged Atlantis.","The first special issue of the New Orleans paper went out at just after four in the morning; as the day went on more issues were published and the details accumulated; at eight in the morning appeared the first photographs of the affected areas with maps of the new inlets from the sea. At half past eight they printed an interview with the celebrated seismologist from Memphis University, Dr. Wilbur R. Bownell, about the cause of the earthquake in Louisiana. It's still too early to come to any firm conclusions, the famous scientist declared, but it seems that these tremors have nothing to do with the volcanic activity, which has been so active up till now, in the volcano belt of central Mexico which lies directly across from the affected area. Today's earthquake seems rather to be of tectonic origin, that's to say it was caused by the weight and pressure of mountains: one the one side there are the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Madre, and on the other side there are Appalachian Hills on the extensive lowlands of the Gulf of Mexico which continue down to the mouth of the Mississippi. The chasm that now runs up from Vermillion Bay is only small and insignificant compared with the geological collapse that has already created the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, along with the ring of islands that make up the Greater and Lesser Antilles, which were once a range of mountains. There is no doubt whatsoever that this subsidence in central America will continue with new tremors, new faults and new chasms appearing; it is even possible that the fault running up from Vermilion Bay is no more than a prelude to the reactivation of the tectonic process with its center in the Gulf of Mexico; and if that is the case we might well be witnesses to an enormous geological catastrophe in which nearly a fifth of the United States might end up as seabed. But if that really is the case there is a certain likelihood that the ocean bed in the region of the Antilles will start to rise, or it could be somewhat further east where, according to the ancient legends, we might hope to find the sunken city of Atlantis.","The first special editions of the New Orleans papers came out soon after four in the morning; as the day wore on later editions carried further details; by eight o’clock the papers had photographs of the stricken area and maps of the new inlet of the sea. At half past eight they published an interview on the causes of the Louisiana earthquake with Dr Wilbur R. Brownell, a leading seismologist from Memphis University. It was too soon for any definitive conclusions, the scientist stated, but it would seem that the tremors were unconnected with the volcanic activity still occurring in the Central American volcanic belt situated opposite the affected area. Today’s earthquake seemed instead to be of tectonic origin, i.e. it had been caused by the pressure of mountain masses - the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Madre on the one side and the Appalachian range on the other - on the extensive depression of the Gulf of Mexico of which the wide plain of the Mississippi delta was a continuation. The fissure now running out of Vermilion Bay was but a new and relatively insignificant rift, a minor episode in the geological downward movement that had created the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea with the arc of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, that remnant of an ancient continuous mountain range. There was no doubt that the Central American subsidence would continue, bringing new tremors, faults and fissures. It could not be ruled out that the Vermilion fissure was a mere prelude to a revival of tectonic activity centred on the Gulf of Mexico. In that event we might witness enormous geological catastrophes with almost one-fifth of the United States sinking below the sea. On the other hand, if that were to happen, we could expect, with a high degree of probability, that the sea-floor in the neighbourhood of the Antilles would begin to rise instead, or even further to the east where ancient legend spoke of a drowned Atlantis."

"O něco málo později plula belgická dopravní loď Oudenbourg z Ostende do Ramsgate. Když byla uprostřed Calaiské úžiny, pozoroval důstojník konající službu, že se půl míle na jih od obvyklého kursu ""něco ve vodě děje"", protože nemohl rozeznat, netone-li tam někdo, kázal plout k tomu silně rozčeřenému místu. Na dvě stě pasažérů přihlíželo z návětrné strany lodi podivnému divadlu: tu a tam vyšplíchla voda kolmým výtryskem, tu a tam se z ní vymrštilo něco jako černé tělo, přitom mořská hladina se v průměru asi tří set metrů divoce zmítala a vřela a bylo slyšet z hlubiny prudký rachot nebo hukot. ""Bylo to, jako by pod vodou soptil nějaký menší vulkán."" Když se Oudenbourg pomalu přiblížila k tomu místu, vyrazila náhle asi deset metrů od přídě ohromná strmá vlna a zaduněl strašný výbuch. Celá loď se prudce nadzvedla a na palubu se snesl déšť vody skoro vařící, zároveň s ní plesklo na přídu silné černé tělo, které se svíjelo a vyráželo ječivý skřek, byl to přeražený a opařený Mlok. Velící důstojník nařídil dát zpětnou páru, aby loď nevjela rovnou do středu toho vybuchujícího pekla, ale zatím to začalo explodovat na všech stranách a hladina moře byla poseta kusy roztrhaných Mloků. Konečně se podařilo loď obrátit a Oudenbourg plnou parou prchala k severu. Tu zaburácel děsný výbuch asi šest set metrů za jejím týlem a z moře vyrazil obrovský, snad sto metrů vysoký sloup vody a páry. Oudenbourg zamířila k Harwich a vysílala na všechny strany bezdrátovou výstrahu: ""Pozor, pozor, pozor! Na linii Ostende-Ramsgate veliké nebezpečí podmořských explozí. Nevíme, co to je. Radíme všem lodím vyhnout se!"" Zatím trvalo dunění a burácení, skoro jako když jsou námořní manévry, ale nebylo nic vidět pro vystřikující vodu a páru. To už z Doveru i z Calais vyplouvaly plnou parou torpédovky a destroyery a hnaly se flotily vojenských letadel k tomu místu, ale když tam dorazily, našly jenom hladinu zkalenou žlutým bahnem a pokrytou leklými rybami a roztrhanými Mloky.","A little later, the Belgian transport ship Oudenbourg sailed from Ostend to Ramsgate. When she was in the middle of the Strait of Calais, an officer on duty watched that half a mile south of the usual ""something in the water"" course, because he couldn't tell if anyone was there, he was telling to sail to the heavily disturbed place. Two hundred passengers watched the strange theater from the windward side of the ship: here and there the water splashed in a vertical jet, here and there something like a black body shot out, while the sea level averaged about three hundred meters and swelled wildly and boiled and could be heard from depths sharp rumble or roar. ""It was as if a smaller volcano was drifting underwater."" As Oudenbourg slowly approached the place, a huge steep wave suddenly erupted about ten meters from the bow and a terrible explosion rumbled. The whole ship rose sharply, and a rain of near-boiling water fell on the deck, at the same time a strong black body slammed into the bow, writhing and a screaming scream, a broken and scalded Newt. The commanding officer ordered the return steam so that the ship would not go straight to the center of the exploding hell, but in the meantime it began to explode on all sides and the sea level was littered with pieces of torn Newts. Finally, the ship was turned over and Oudenbourg fled north at full speed. A terrible explosion rumbled about six hundred meters behind her, and a huge column of water and steam rose from the sea, perhaps a hundred meters high. Oudenbourg headed for Harwich and sent a wireless warning on all sides: ""Watch out, watch out, watch out! There is a great danger of submarine explosions on the Ostend-Ramsgate line. We don't know what it is. We advise all ships to avoid!"" So far, the roaring and roaring took place, almost like when there are naval maneuvers, but nothing was seen for splashing water and steam. Torpedo boats and destroyers were already full of steam from Dover and Calais, and fleets of military planes rushed to the place, but when they arrived they found only a surface muddy with yellow mud and covered with frightened fish and torn Newts.","Not long afterwards, a Belgian ferry, the Oudenbourg, was steaming its way from Ostende to Ramsgate. In the straits of Dover the duty officer noticed that half a mile south of its usual course there was something going on in the water. He could not be sure that there was no-one drowning there and so he ordered a change of course down to where the perturbance was taking place. Two hundred passengers on the windward side of the ship were shown a very strange spectacle: in some places a vertical jet of water shot out from the surface, and in some of those vertical jets there could be seen something like a black body thrown up with it; the surface of the sea for one or two hundred yards all around was tossing and seething wildly while, from the depths, a loud rattling and humming could be heard. “It was as if there was a small volcano erupting under the sea.” As the Oudenbourg slowly approached the place an enormous wave rose about ten yards ahead of it and a terrible noise thundered out like an explosion. The entire ship was lifted violently and the deck was showered with a rain of water that was nearly boiling hot; and landing on the deck with the water was a strong black body which writhed and let out a sharp loud scream; it was a newt that had been injured and burnt. The captain ordered the ship full steam astern so that the ship would not steam straight into the middle of this turbulent Hell; but the water all around had also begun to erupt and the surface of the sea was strewn with pieces of dismembered newts. The ship was finally able to turn around and it fled northwards as fast as possible. Then there was a terrible explosion about six hundred yards to the stern and a gigantic column of water and steam, perhaps a hundred yards high, shot out of the sea. The Oudenbourg set course for Harwich and sent out a radio warning in all directions: “Attention all shipping, attention all shipping! Severe danger on Ostende-Ramsgate lane. Underwater explosion. Cause unknown. All shipping advised avoid area!” All this time the sea was thundering and boiling, almost as if military manoeuvres had been taking place under the water; but apart from the erupting water and steam there was nothing to see. From both Dover and Calais, destroyers and torpedo boats set out at full steam and squadrons of military aircraft flew to the site of the disturbance; but by the time they got there all they found was that the surface was discoloured with something like a yellow mud and covered with startled fish and newts that had been torn to pieces.","Some time later the Belgian ferryboat Oudenbourgh was sailing from Ostend to Ramsgate. Halfway across the Straits of Dover the duty officer noticed ‘something happening in the water’ half a mile south of her usual course. Because he was unable to make out if somebody was not perhaps drowning he gave orders for the ship to make for the spot where the water was so fiercely churned up. Nearly 200 passengers watched the strange spectacle from the windward side: in some places the water was splashing up in vertical columns, in others something like a black body was flung up with it; over an area about 300 metres across the sea’s surface was intensely agitated and seething, and a loud rumble and roar was heard to come from the depth. It was just as if a small volcano was erupting under water. As the Oudenbourgh slowly drew near the spot a gigantic precipitous wave suddenly rose up some ten metres from her bows and there was a frightful explosion. The whole ship rose sharply and a shower of near-boiling water descended on her deck; simultaneously a powerful black body smacked down on her foredeck, writhing and screaming in agony: it was a mutilated and scalded Newt. The captain ordered full steam astern to prevent the ship sailing straight into the middle of that exploding inferno but by now explosions were occurring all over the place and the surface was strewn with pieces of dismembered Newts. Eventually the ship was turned about, and the Oudenbourgh made off north at full steam. Just then there was a terrifying explosion and a huge column of water and steam, perhaps 100 metres high, shot up some 600 metres astern. The Oudenbourgh headed straight for Harwich, radioing warnings in all directions: ‘Warning, warning, warning! Great danger of submarine explosions on Ostend-Ramsgate route. Cause unknown. All craft advised to avoid the area!’ Meanwhile the rumble and roar continued, almost as if naval exercises were taking place; but because of the spouts of water and steam there was nothing to be seen. By then torpedo-boats and destroyers had set out from Dover and Calais at full steam and squadrons of military aircraft were making for the spot. However, all they found on arrival was the surface muddied with yellow slime and covered with dead fish and mangled Newts."
"Vnitřní hlas chvilku mlčel. ""A není ti lidstva líto?""","The inner voice was silent for a moment.

"Zatím noviny - podle své politické barvy - navrhovaly trestní, vyhlazovací, kolonizační nebo křížovou výpravu proti Mlokům, generální stávku, demisi vlády, zatčení mločích podnikatelů, zatčení komunistických vůdců a agitátorů a mnoho jiných takových záchranných opatření. S pověstmi o možném uzávěru břehů a přístavů se lidé počali horečně zásobit potravinami a ceny veškerého zboží stoupaly závratným tempem, v průmyslových městech vypukly protidrahotní bouře, burza byla na tři dny zavřena. Byla to prostě nejnapjatější a nejhrozivější situace za poslední tři nebo čtyři měsíce. V tu chvíli však do věci obratně zasáhl ministr orby M. Monti. Zařídil totiž, aby na francouzském pobřeží bylo dvakrát týdně nasypáno do moře pro Mloky tolik a tolik set vagónů jablek, ovšem na státní náklad. Toto opatření neobyčejně uspokojilo Mloky a uklidnilo sadaře v Normandii a jinde. Ale M. Monti šel v tom směru dál: protože už dlouho byly potíže s hlubokým a povážlivým vřením ve vinařských krajích, trpících nedostatkem odbytu, nařídil, aby stát přispíval na Mloky tím způsobem, že každý Salamandr bude dostávat denně půl litru bílého vína. Mloci si zprvu nevěděli s tím vínem rady, protože byli po něm postihováni silnými průjmy, a vylévali je do moře, ale během času si na ně patrně zvykli, a bylo pozorováno, že od té doby se francouzští Mloci pářili horlivěji, byť s menší plodností než dříve. Tak byla jedním rázem rozřešena agrární otázka i mločí aféra, hrozivé napětí bylo zažehnáno, a když zakrátko vypukla nová krize vlády pro finanční skandál Mme Töpplerové, stal se obratný a osvědčený M. Monti v novém kabinetu ministrem námořnictví.","So far, the newspaper - according to its political color - has proposed a criminal, extermination, colonization or crusade against the Newts, a general strike, the resignation of the government, the arrest of salamander businessmen, the arrest of communist leaders and agitators and many other such rescue measures. With rumors of a possible closure of the banks and ports, people began to feverishly supply their food and the prices of all goods rose at a dizzying pace, anti-dramatic storms broke out in industrial cities, and the stock exchange closed for three days. It was simply the most tense and threatening situation in the last three or four months. At that moment, however, the Minister of Plowing, M. Monti, deftly intervened. He arranged for two and so many wagons of apples to be dumped into the sea on the French coast twice a week, but at state expense. This measure greatly satisfied the Newts and appeased the orchards in Normandy and elsewhere. But M. Monti went further: because for a long time there had been a problem of deep and considerable boiling in the wine-growing regions, which suffered from a lack of sales, he ordered the state to contribute to the Newts in such a way that each Salamander received half a liter of white wine a day. The salamanders did not know how to deal with the wine at first because they were affected by severe diarrhea and poured it into the sea, but over time they probably got used to it, and it has been observed that French salamanders have mated more eagerly, albeit with less fertility. than before. Thus, the agrarian issue and the salamander affair were resolved in one go, the terrible tensions were averted, and when a new government crisis erupted for Mme Töppler's financial scandal, M. Monti became a skilled and well-established Minister of the Navy in his new cabinet.","The newspapers, according to their political colour, urged punishment, eradication, colonisation or a crusade against the newts, a general strike, resignation of the government, the arrest of newt owners, the arrest of communist leaders and agitators and many other protective measures of this sort. People began frantically to stockpile food when rumours of the shores and ports being closed off began to spread, and the prices of goods of every sort soared; riots caused by rising prices broke out in the industrial cities; the stock exchange was closed for three days. It was simply the more worrying and dangerous than it had been at any time over the previous three or four months. But this was when the minister for agriculture, Monsieur Monti, stepped dexterously in. He gave orders that several hundred loads of apples for the newts should be discharged into the sea twice a week along the French coasts, at government cost, of course. This measure was remarkably successful in pacifying both the newts and the villagers in Normandy and elsewhere. But Monsieur Monti went even further: there had long been deep and serious disturbances in the wine-growing regions, resulting from a lack of turnover, so he ordered that the state should provide each newt with a half litre of white wine per day. At first the newts did not know what to do with this wine because it caused them serious diarrhoea and they poured it into the sea; but with a little time they clearly became used to it, and it was noticed that from then on the newts would show a lot more enthusiasm for sex, although with lower fertility rates than before. In this way, problems to do with the newts and with agriculture were solved in one stroke; fear and tension were assuaged, and, in short, the next time there was another government crisis, caused by the financial scandal around Madame TÃ¶ppler, the clever and well proven Monsieur Monti became the minister for marine affairs in the new cabinet.","The newspapers meanwhile - each according to its political colouring - proposed punitive, extermination, colonising campaigns and crusades against the Newts, a general strike, the resignation of the government, the arrest of all employers of Newts, the arrest of Communist leaders and agitators, and a lot of other similar safety procedures. In view of rumours about a possible closing of coasts and harbours the public feverishly began to lay in stocks of food, and the prices of all goods rose at a vertiginous rate. In industrial cities riots broke out against the price rises; the stock exchange was closed for three days. It was quite simply the tensest and most dangerous situation of the past three or four months. At that moment, however, the Minister of Agriculture, M. Monti, intervened. He arranged for a certain number of railway wagons of apples to be tipped into the sea off the French coast twice a week, needless to say at state expense. This measure had an exceedingly calming effect on the Newts and also satisfied the fruit farmers in Normandy and elsewhere. But M. Monti went even further along the same lines: because for a long time there had been a good deal of trouble with profound and alarming unrest in wine-growing districts - which were suffering from insufficient market demand - he arranged that the state should subsidise the Newts in such a way that every salamander would receive half a litre of white wine daily. At first the Newts were at a loss what to do with the wine because it gave them severe diarrhoea, and so they poured it into the sea; with time, however, they clearly got used to it and it has been observed that since then the French Newts have mated more eagerly though with a lesser fertility than before. Thus the agrarian problem and the Newt affair were solved at a single stroke: the dangerous tension was eased, and when a fresh government crisis arose shortly afterwards in connection with the financial scandal around Mme Toppler, the ingenious and well-tried M. Monti became Minister for the Navy in the new government."

"Jde tedy, jak z uvedených znaků zřejmo, o typického člena řádu obojživelníků ocasatých (Urodela), k nimž, jak je každému známo, náleží čeleď mloků pravých (Salamandrida), zahrnující rod čolků (Tritones) a mloků (Salamandrae), a čeleď mloků pulcovitých (Ichthyoidea), zahrnující mloky krytožábré (Cryptobranchiata) a žabernaté (Phanerobranchiata). Mlok zjištěný na ostrově Tongarewa zdá se být nejblíže příbuzný mlokům pulcovitým krytožábrým, v mnohém směru, mimo jiné svou velikostí, připomíná japonského velemloka obrovského (Megalobatrachus Sieboldii) nebo amerického hellbendra, zvaného ""bahenní čert"", ale liší se od nich dobře vyvinutými čidly a delšími, silnějšími končetinami, které mu dovolují pohybovat se dosti obratně ve vodě i na souši. (Následují další podrobnosti srovnávací anatomie.)","It is therefore, as is clear from the above features, a typical member of the order of amphibians (Urodela), which, as everyone knows, includes the family of salamanders (Salamander), which includes the genus of newts (Tritones) and salamanders (Salamandrae), and the family of salamanders. tadpoles (Ichthyoidea), including salamanders (Cryptobranchiata) and gills (Phanerobranchiata). The salamander found on Tongarewa appears to be most closely related to tadpole salamanders, in many ways, reminiscent in size, resembling the Japanese giant salamander (Megalobatrachus Sieboldii) or the American hellbender, called the ""mud devil"", but differs from them by well-developed sensors and longer, stronger limbs that allow him to move quite deftly in water and on land. (Further details of comparative anatomy follow.)","The above indicators make it clear that this was a typical member of the order of caudate amphibians (urodela) which, as is widely known, includes the salamander genus (salamandridae), comprising the family of spotted salamanders (tritons) and newts (salamandrae), and the family of tadpole spawning newts (ichthyoidea), made up of the pseudo-gilled newts (cryptobranchiata) and the gilled newts (phanerobranchiata). The newt found on the island of Tongarewa seems to be most closely related to the tadpole spawning pseudo-gilled newts; in many respects, including its size, it is reminiscent of the great Japanese newt (megalobatrachus sieboldii) or the American hellbender, better known as the mud devil, but it does distinguish itself from these species by its well developed sensors and the greater length and strength of its limbs which enable it to move with some facility both in water and on land. (There followed further details of comparative anatomy).","It is clear, therefore, from the characteristics listed above, that we are concerned with a typical member of the order of caudate reptiles (Urodela), to which, as is well known, belongs the family of real salamanders (Salamandrida), which in turn comprises the genera of newts (Tritones) and salamanders (Salamandrae), as well as the family of perinnibranchs (Ichthyoidea), which in turn comprises the cryptobranchiate (Cryptobranchiata) and branchiate (Phanerobranchiata) forms. The salamander recorded on the island of Tangarewa would seem to be most closely related to the perinnibranch cryptobranchiates; in many respects, such as size, it resembles the Japanese Giant Salamander (Megalobranchus Sieboldii) and the American hellbender, known as the ‘swamp devil’, though it differs from these by its well-developed sensory organs and its longer and more powerful extremities, which enable it to move with marked agility both in the water and on dry land.

"... Se značnou opatrností je nutno přijímat také zprávy cestovatelů, podle nichž se tito mloci objevují také na jiných ostrovech než na Manihiki. Zato lze bez nejmenší pochybnosti určit recentní vtisk zadní nohy, nalezený na břehu ostrova Tongatabu, jejž publikoval Capt. Croisset v La Nature, jako šlépěj Andriase Scheuchzeri. Tento nález je zvláště důležitý tím, že spojuje výskyt na Manihiki Islands s oblastí australsko-novozélandskou, kde se uchovalo tolik zbytků vývoje prastaré fauny, připomeňme si zejména ""předpotopního° ještěra haterii čili tuataru, dodnes žijící na ostrově Stephenově. Na těchto osamělých, většinou málo osídlených a civilizací téměř nedotčených ostrůvkách se mohly ojediněle uchovat zbytky živočišných typů jinde již vymřelých. K fosilnímu ještěru haterii přibývá nyní dík panu J. S. Tinckerovi předpotopní mlok. Dobrý dr. Johannes Jakob Scheuchzer by se nyní dožil vzkříšení svého Lihningenského Adama...","... Travelers' reports that these salamanders also appear on islands other than Manihiki must also be received with great caution. On the other hand, a recent footprint found on the shores of Tongatabu Island, published by Capt. Croisset in La Nature, as footsteps by Andrias Scheuchzeri. This finding is particularly important in that it links the Manihiki Islands to the Australian-New Zealand region, where so many remnants of ancient fauna have survived, especially the ""pre-Flood lizard"" or tuataru, still living on Stephen's Island. The remnants of animal populations and almost untouched by civilization have been able to occasionally preserve the remains of animal species that have already become extinct elsewhere.","... Travellers tales, according to which these newts are also to be found on other islands than Manihiki, should be taken with extreme caution. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that the fresh footprints found on the shore of the island of Tongatabu and published by Captain Croisset in La Nature are those of Andrias Scheuchzer. This finding is of especial importance given that they form a connection between their appearance on the Manihiki Islands with Australasia, where so many vestiges of the development of ancient fauna have been preserved; let us bear in mind in particular the antediluvian lizard hateri or tuatara, which survives to this day on Stephen Island. These islands are mostly sparsely inhabited and hardly touched by civilization, and it is possible that isolated remains of species elsewhere extinct may have continued to survive there. Thanks to the efforts of Mister J.S. Tincker, an antediluvian newt has now been added to the ancient lizard, hateri.","Obviously this is just a case of primitive legends and superstitions based presumably on the repulsive appearance and the erect quasi-human walk of these harmless giant salamanders. … Travellers’ accounts according to which these salamanders are found also on islands other than the Manihiki archipelago should be received with a good deal of reserve. On the other hand, there cannot be the least doubt about identifying a recent imprint of a hind-foot, found on the beach of Tongatabu Island and published by Capt. Croisset in La Nature, as belonging to Andrias Scheuchzeri. This find is of especial significance in that it links the animals’ occurrence in the Manihiki Islands with the Australian-New Zealand zone, where so many survivors of an ancient fauna have been preserved: we need only think of the ‘antediluvian’ lizard Hatterii or Tuaturu, still living on Stephen Island. On these remote and for the most part sparsely populated little islands, almost untouched by civilisation, individual relics of animal types extinct elsewhere have succeeded in surviving."

"""Tak polez,"" křikl kapitán, ale pak se podíval pozorněji a už skákal po balvanech k těm zoufale tápajícím rukám, člověk by nevěřil, že takové těleso dovede tak skákat. V posledním okamžiku zachytil jednu ruku a supě tahal Sinhálce z vody. Potom ho položil na balvan a utíral si pot. Sinhálec ležel bez hnutí, měl jeden bérec odřený na kost, patrně o kámen, ale jinak byl celý. Kapitán mu nadzvedl víčko, bylo vidět jenom bělmo očí zvrácených v sloup. Neměl škeblí ani nože.","""Come on,"" the captain shouted, but then he looked more closely and was already jumping over the boulders to those desperately groping hands, one would not believe that such a body could jump like that. At the last moment, he grabbed one hand and pulled the Sinhalese vulture out of the water. Then he laid him on a boulder and wiped his sweat. The Sinhalese lay motionless, having one shin rubbed against the bone, probably against a rock, but otherwise he was whole. The captain lifted his lid, only the whites of his eyes visible in the pillar. He didn't have clams or knives.","“Come on, hurry up,” the captain shouted, but then he began to look more carefully and soon he himself was jumping and clambering over the rocks to the Sinhalese; no-one would have thought that a body like that could jump so nimbly. At the last moment he caught hold of the Sinhalese hand and pulled him breathless from the water. Then he lay him on the rock and wiped the sweat off his brow. The Sinhalese lay without moving; his shin had been scraped and the bone underneath was exposed, clearly he had injured it on some rock, but he was otherwise unhurt. The captain raised the man's eyelid; all he could see was the white. There was no sign of any oysters or the knife.","‘Well, get out then,’ the captain shouted. But then he looked more closely and already he was leaping over the boulders towards those desperately groping hands; you’d never credit such a bulk with such agility. He just managed to snatch hold in time of one hand, and panting he dragged the Singhalese out of the water. Then he laid him down on a rock and mopped his sweat. The Singhalese was lying motionless: one of his shins was skinned to the bone, evidently by a rock, but otherwise he was in one piece. The captain lifted his eyelid: only the white of his upturned eyes was visible. He had no shells and no knife."

"Dějiny Mloků se tedy od začátku vyznačují tím, že byly dobře a racionálně organizovány, první, ale nikoliv jediná zásluha o to náleží Mločímu syndikátu, budiž uznáno, že také věda, filantropie, osvěta, tisk a jiní činitelé mají nemalý podíl na úžasném rozšíření a pokroku Mloků. Nicméně byl to Mločí syndikát, který tak říkajíc den za dnem dobýval pro Salamandry nových kontinentů a nových břehů, i když musel překonávat mnohé překážky brzdící tuto expanzi. Čtvrtletní zprávy syndikátu ukazují, jak jsou postupně osídlovány Mloky přístavy indické a čínské, jak mločí kolonizace zaplavuje pobřeží Afriky a přeskakuje na kontinent americký, kde záhy vznikají nové, nejmodernější mločí líhně v zálivu Mexickém, jak vedle těchto širokých kolonizačních vln jsou vysílány menší skupiny Mloků jako pionýrský předvoj budoucího exportu. Tak například holandskému Waterstaatu poslal Mločí syndikát darem tisíc prvotřídních Mloků, městu Marseille věnoval šest set Salamandrů k vyčištění Starého přístavu, a podobně jinde. Prostě na rozdíl od lidského osídlování světa se šíření Mloků dálo plánovitě a velkoryse, kdyby bylo ponecháno přírodě, táhlo by se jistě po staletí a tisíciletí, co platno, příroda není a nikdy nebyla tak podnikavá a účelná jako lidská výroba a obchod. Zdá se, že čilá poptávka měla vliv i na plodnost Mloků, výnos potěru z jedné samice stoupl až na sto padesát pulců ročně. Jisté pravidelné ztráty, které na Mlocích působili žraloci, ustaly skoro úplně, když Mloci byli opatřeni podvodními pistolemi s náboji dumdum na obranu proti dravým rybám.","The history of Newts has thus been characterized from the beginning by being well and rationally organized, the first but not the only merit of which belongs to the Newt Syndicate, let it be recognized that science, philanthropy, enlightenment, the press and other factors also play a significant role in Progress of Newts. However, it was the Newt Syndicate that, so to speak, conquered new continents and new shores for Salamanders, so to speak, even though it had to overcome many obstacles to this expansion. The syndicate's quarterly reports show how Newts are gradually settled in Indian and Chinese ports, how newt colonization floods the coast of Africa and jumps to the American continent, where new, state-of-the-art newt hatcheries in the Gulf of Mexico soon emerge, and smaller groups of Newts as a pioneering vanguard of future exports. For example, he sent the Newt Syndicate to the Dutch Waterstaat as a gift of a thousand first-class Newts, donated six hundred Salamanders to the city of Marseille to clean up the Old Port, and so on elsewhere. Quite unlike the human settlement of the world, the spread of Newts was planned and generous, if left to nature, it would certainly last for centuries and millennia, what nature is not and has never been as enterprising and efficient as human production and trade. It seems that the brisk demand also affected the fertility of Newts, the yield of fry from one female rose to one hundred and fifty tadpoles a year. Certain regular losses caused by sharks on Newts ceased almost completely when Newts were fitted with underwater pistols with dumdum bullets to defend against predatory fish.","The history of the newts was characterised from the first by good and rational organisation and that is primarily, although not solely, thanks to the Newt Syndicate; it should be acknowledged that science, philanthropy, education, the press and other factors played a substantial part in the astonishing expansion and progress of the newts, but it's still true to say that it was the Newt Syndicate that conquered new continents and coastlines for them, virtually day by day, even when they had to overcome many obstacles to their expansion. 4 The syndicate's quarterly statements show that the newts were gradually settled in the ports of India and China; how colonies of newts overwhelmed the coasts of Africa and jumped over to America where a new and modern hatchery soon appeared on the Gulf of Mexico; how, as well as the broad waves of colonisations, smaller, pioneering groups of newts were sent out to establish new places for migration. The Newt Syndicate sent, for instance, a thousand top quality newts as a present to Waterstaat in Holland, six hundred were given to the city of Marseilles to clean out the old harbour, and similar presents were made elsewhere. The dispersion and settlement of the newts around the world was, unlike the expansion of mankind, simply well planned and enormous; left to Nature it would certainly have taken thousands of years; but that is merely hypothetical. Nature has never been so enterprising and targeted as man's industry and commerce. It seemed that the lively demand for them had its influence on the newts' own reproductive abilities; the number of tadpoles produced by any one female rose to as much as a hundred and fifty per year. Loses to sharks and other predatory fish were reduced almost to zero after the newts had been equipped with underwater pistols and dumdum bullets to protect themselves. 5 ENGLAND CLOSED OFF TO NEWTS? (Reuter) In reply to a question in the House of Commons from Mr. J. Leeds, Sir Samuel Mandeville stated today that His Majesty's Government had closed the Suez Canal to newt transports of any kind; he added that no newt would be permitted to be employed on any shoreline or any sovereign waters of the British Isles. The reason for this measure, Sir Samuel declared, was partly to do with the security of the British Isles and partly to do with old statutes still in force concerning the elimination of slave trading.","The history of the Newts is thus characterised from the very outset by its perfect and rational organisation; the principal but not exclusive credit for this must go to the Salamander Syndicate; it should, however, be acknowledged that science, philanthropic endeavour, enlightenment, the press and other factors also played a considerable part in the spectacular spread and progress of the Newts. That said, it was the Salamander Syndicate which, so to speak, daily conquered new continents and new shores for the Newts, even though it had to overcome many an obstacle to that expansion.4 The Syndicate’s quarterly reports show how Indian and Chinese harbours are, one after the other, being settled by the Newts; how Newt colonisation is swamping the coast of Africa and leaping across to the American continent, where new, super-modern Newt incubators are fast springing up in the Gulf of Mexico; and how, alongside these vast waves of colonisation, smaller groups of Newts are sent out as pioneering vanguards of future exports. Thus the Salamander Syndicate made a present of 1,000 top-quality Newts to the Dutch Waterstaat; it presented the city of Marseilles with 600 Newts for clearing out the Old Port, and similarly elsewhere. In short, unlike human colonisation of the globe, the spread of the Newts proceeded in accordance with a plan and on a generous scale; had it been left to nature it would have dragged on over hundreds and thousands of years. Say what you will, but nature is not, and never has been, as enterprising and purposeful as human production and commerce. It seems that the lively demand for Newts has even had an effect on their fertility; the spawn yield per female has risen to as much as 150 tadpoles per annum. Certain regular losses which sharks used to cause to the Newts ceased almost totally once the Newts had been equipped with underwater pistols and dum-dum ammunition for defence against predatory fish.5"

No-one even bats an eyelid at it these days. What a song and dance they used to make at first whenever these newts flooded anywhere!

At least they're not here, though; but I wish the prices weren't so high! Think what they charge for coffee these days! I suppose that's what you have to expect if they go and flood Brazil.

Well, one’s no longer surprised at anything. The fuss that was made some years ago when the Newts inundated a country! Even if it was only Mesopotamia or China the papers were full of it. But by now no one’s getting excited any more, Mr Povondra reflected sadly, blinking over his rod once or twice. One gets used to anything, and that’s a fact. It’s not happening here, so why worry? If only things weren’t so dear! Take the price they’re charging for coffee nowadays; well, of course, Brazil has also disappeared under the water.

Já to měl už jednou ve Frisku, však víš, Jensene, ale tehdy jsem viděl samé pavouky. De-li-rium, říkali doktoři v Sailor-hospital. Tak já nevím. Ale pak jsem se ptal Big Binga, viděl-li to v noci taky, a on říkal, prý viděl. Prý zahlíd na vlastní oči, jak jeden ještěr bere za kliku a jde ke kapitánovi do kabiny.

But the strangest thing is that he lets them into He stops at a stupid island, takes a boat on the shore and measures the depths, then locks at the tanks, opens a hatch at the side of the ship and lets the bitches into the water. ten or twelve - And then at night, old Toch goes ashore with some boxes. No one should know what he has in them. Then he goes on again. That's how old Toch is, Jensi. Mr. Dingl's eyes froze. ""Almighty God, Jens, I was sick of it! I drank, man, I drank like a fool, and when it knocked all over the ship at night and panned ... and did ts-ts-ts, I sometimes thought Oh, lad, it'll be from the booze I've had it once in Frisk, you know, Jensen, but that's when I saw the spiders, De-rium, the doctors at Sailor-hospital said So I don't know But then I he asked Big Bing if he saw it at night, too, and he said he saw it, he said, he'd see with his own eyes as one lizard took the doorknob and went to the captain in the cabin. ""Jens, did Bing have de-lirium? What do you think?""","“That's enough now, Captain, says the mate, and he pours a bucket of water over me head. So in Kokopo I went on shore.” Mister Dingle spat in a long, flat curve. “The old man cares more about dem vermin then he does about people. D'ye know he taught em how to speak? On my soul, he used to shut himself in wid em and spend hours talking to them. I tink he's trainin em for a circus or sometin. But the strangest ting of all is that then he lets them out into the water. He'd weigh anchor by some pathetic little island, take a boat out to the shore and check how deep it is there; then he'd come back to these tanks, open the hatch in the side o the ship and let these vermin out into the water. And you should see them jumpin out through this hatch one after the other like trained seals, ten or twenty o them. Then in the night old Toch would row out to the shore again with some kind o crates. And no-one was ever allowed to know what was in them. Then we'd sail on again somewhere else. So that's how it is wid old Toch, Jens. Very strange. Very, very strange.” Mister Dingle's eyes lost their sparkle. “Almighty God, Jens, it gave me the creeps! And I drank, Jens, drank like a lunatic; and in the night, when there was this tip-tappin all over the ship, and you could hear them going ts-ts-ts , sometimes I'd tink it was just because of the drink. I'd already had that once in Frisco, well you already know about that, don't you Jensen ; only in them days it was just millions of spiders I saw. De-li-rium, the doctors called it in the sailor-hospital. Well, I don't know. But then I asked Big Bing about it, whether he'd been seein tings in the night and all, and he said he had been. Said he'd seen them wid his own eyes how one o these lizards turned the handle on the door and went into the captains cabin. Well, I don't know; this Joe, he was a Hell of a drinker and all. What do you tink, Jens, do you tink Bing had this de-lirium too? What do you tink?”","‘He’s had enough sir, the mate said, and poured a bucket of water over my head. And in Kokopo I went ashore.’ Mr Dingle spat in a long flat trajectory. ‘The old man cared more for those brutes than for his crew. Did you know he taught them to speak? Cross my heart, he’d lock himself up with them for hours on end and talk to them. I think he’s training them like for a circus. But the oddest thing is that afterwards he lets them out into the water. He’ll heave to off some silly little island, sail the boat along the shore, taking depth soundings, then he’ll lock himself up near those tanks, open the broadside hatch and let the brutes into the water. Man, they dive in through that little window, one after another, just like trained seals - always some ten or twelve. And then old Toch rows to the shore at night, with some little crates. No one’s allowed to know what he’s got in them. And then the ship sails on. That’s how things are with old Toch, Jensy. Odd. Very odd.’ Mr Dingle’s eyes became fixed. ‘ God Almighty, Jensy, I was getting the wind up! I drank, man; I drank like a fish; and when there was this tapping at night and this waddling on hindlegs all over the ship … and that ts-ts-ts … well, sometimes I thought: Aha, Dingle, my boyo, that comes from drink. It happened to me once before, in Frisco, as you well know, Jensy: only then I was seeing nothing but spiders. De-li-rium, that’s what the doctors at the Sailors’ Hospital called it. So I don’t know. But then I asked Big Bing if he’d seen anything at night, and he said he had. Said he saw with his own eyes how one of those lizards turned the door handle and went into the captain’s cabin.

"... Záhadou zůstává, proč tento zajímavý velemlok unikl až dotud vědecké pozornosti, ačkoliv se aspoň na ostrovech Rakahanga a Tongarewa v souostroví Manihiki vyskytuje hromadně. Ani Randolph a Montgomery ve svém spise ""Dva roky na ostrovech Manihiki"" (1885) se o něm nezmiňují. Místní obyvatelé tvrdí, že se toto zvíře - které ostatně považují za jedovaté - začalo ukazovat teprve před šesti nebo osmi léty. Vypravují, že ""mořští čerti"" dovedou mluvit (!) a staví si v zálivech, kde žijí, celé soustavy valů a hrází na způsob podmořských měst, prý v jejich zálivech je po celý rok voda tichá jako v rybníce, prý si vyhrabávají pod vodou mnoho metrů dlouhé nory a chodby, ve kterých se zdržují během dne, prý v noci kradou na polích sladké brambory a yamy a odnášejí lidem motyky a jiné nářadí. Vůbec lidé je mají neradi, a dokonce se jich obávají, v mnoha případech se odstěhovali raději na jiná místa Zřejmě tu jde o pouhé primitivní pověsti a pověry, zdůvodněné leda odpuzujícím vzhledem a vzpřímenou, poněkud lidskou chůzí neškodných velikých mloků.","... It remains a mystery why this interesting greyhound has escaped scientific attention so far, although at least on the islands of Rakahanga and Tongarewa in the Manihiki archipelago it occurs en masse. Randolph and Montgomery do not mention him in their ""Two Years in the Manihiki Islands"" (1885). Locals say the animal - which is considered poisonous - only began to show up six or eight years ago. They say that the ""sea devils"" can talk (!) And build whole systems of ramparts and dikes in the bays where they live in the manner of submarine cities, it is said that in their bays the water is as quiet as in a pond all year round, they say they dig underwater many meters long burrows and corridors in which they stay during the day are said to steal sweet potatoes and yams in the fields at night and take hoes and other tools to people. People don't like them at all, and they even fear them, in many cases they prefer to move to other places.","The question as to why this interesting giant newt has hitherto escaped scientific attention remains a mystery, especially considering the large numbers in which it is found on the islands of Rakahanga and Tongarewa in the Manihiki archipelago.

The local inhabitants insist that this animal—which they also consider to be poisonous—began to appear no more than six or eight years ago. They say that these sea demons are capable of speech (!), and that in the bays where they live they construct entire systems of weirs and sea-walls in a way that resembles underwater cities; that the water in their bays remains as still as a mill pond throughout the entire year; that they excavate dens and passages in the ground under the water which are many meters long and in which they remain during the day; that at night they come out into the fields to steal sweet potatoes and yams and take hoes and pickaxes and other tools from the human population. The native people have developed a strong aversion to the newts and even live somewhat in fear of them; many of them have preferred to move away to other areas. It is clear that this is nothing more than primitive legends and superstitions resulting from the revolting appearance and upright stance and gait, somewhat resembling the walk of a human being, of these harmless giant newts.","… It remains a mystery why this interesting giant salamander should, until now, have eluded scientific attention, even though it occurs in large numbers at least on the islands of Rakahanga and Tongarewa in the Manihiki archipelago. It is not mentioned by Randolph and Montgomery in their work Two Years on the Islands of Manihiki (1885). The local population maintains that this animal - which incidentally they believe to be venomous - only began to show itself during the past six or eight years. They claim that the ‘sea devils’ can talk (sic) and that they build entire systems of barriers and dams in the bays they inhabit, in the nature of submarine cities; they say the water in these bays is as smooth as a millpond all the year round; they also state that they dig out, under the water, burrows and passages many metres long and that they stay in these during the day; at night they are said to steal sweet potatoes and yams from the fields, and even carry off hoes and other tools.

"Tak tedy došlo k tomu, že pan Povondra začal shromažďovat výstřižky o Mlocích. Jeho sběratelské vášni vděčíme za mnoho materiálu, který by byl jinak upadl v zapomenutí. Vystřihoval a schovával vše, co kde našel tištěno o Mlocích, nebudiž utajeno, že po jistých počátečních rozpacích se naučil ve své oblíbené kavárně plenit noviny, kde byla jaká zmínka o Mlocích, a dosáhl zvláštní, téměř kouzelnické virtuozity v tom, jak dovedl nenápadně vytrhnout z novin příslušný list a ztopit jej do kapsy přímo před očima pana vrchního. Jak známo, všichni sběratelé jsou ochotni krást nebo vraždit, jde-li o to, aby získali nové číslo do své sbírky, ale to nijak nesnižuje jejich mravní charakter.","So it happened that Mr. Povondra began collecting clippings about Newts. We owe his collecting passion to a lot of material that would otherwise have fallen into oblivion. He cut out and hid everything he'd found printed about Newts, let's not hide the fact that, after some initial embarrassment, he learned to plunder newspapers in his favorite cafe, where there was a mention of Newts, and achieved a strange, almost magical virtuosity in how he managed to snatch from the newspaper the relevant sheet and drown it in his pocket right in front of Mr. Chief. As is well known, all collectors are willing to steal or murder when it comes to getting a new issue in their collection, but that does not diminish their moral character.","So it was that Mister Povondra started his collection of newspaper cuttings about the newts. Without his passion as a collector much of the material we now have would otherwise have been lost. He cut out and saved everything written about the newts that he could find; it should even be said that after some initial fumblings he learned to plunder the newspapers in his favourite cafÃ© wherever there was mention of the newts and even developed an unusual, almost magical, virtuosity in tearing the appropriate article out of the paper and putting it in his pocket right under the nose of the head waiter. It is well known that all collectors are willing to steal and murder if that is what's needed to add a certain item to their collection, but that is not in any way a stain on their moral character.","Thus it came about that Mr Povondra started collecting newspaper cuttings about the Newts. To his zeal as a collector we owe a great deal of material which would otherwise have passed into oblivion. He cut out and filed away anything he found in print about the Newts; indeed no secret should be made of the fact that, after some initial inhibitions, he acquired the knack, in his regular cafe, of ransacking the papers whenever there was a mention of the Newts in them, and that he attained a special, almost prestidigitational, skill in inconspicuously ripping the relevant page from the paper and whisking it into his pocket right under the headwaiter’s eyes. It is a well-known fact that all collectors are prepared to steal or do murder for the sake of acquiring a new piece for their collection; but this does not in any way reflect on their moral character."

"Bez konce je lidská všetečnost Lidem nestačilo, že profesor J. W. Hopkins (Yale Un.), největší té doby autorita v oboru reptilií, prohlásil ony záhadné tvory za nevědecký humbuk a pouhou fantazii, v odborném tisku i v novinách se počaly množit zprávy o výskytu dosud neznámých zvířat, podobných obrovským mlokům, na nejrůznějších místech Tichého oceánu. Poměrně spolehlivé údaje uváděly naleziště na ostrovech Šalomounských, na ostrově Schoutenově, na Kapingamarangi, Butaritari a Tapeteuea, dále na celé skupině ostrůvků: Nukufetau, Fanufuti, Nukonono a Fukaofu, potom až na Hiau, Uahuka, Uapu a Pukapuka. Byly citovány pověsti o čertech kapitána van Tocha (hlavně v oblasti melanéské) a o tritónech slečny Lily (spíše v Polynésii), i usoudily noviny, že jde asi o různé druhy podmořských a předpotopních oblud, zvláště proto, že nastala letní sezóna a nebylo o čem psát. Podmořské obludy mívají u čtenářů značný úspěch. Zejména v USA přišli tritóni do módy, v New Yorku se hrála třistakrát výpravná revue Poseidón s třemi sty nejkrásnějšími tritónkami, nereidkami a sirénami, v Miami i na plážích kalifornských se mládež koupala v kostýmech tritónů a nereidek (tj. tři šňůry perel a nic víc), kdežto ve středních a středozápadních státech neobyčejně zmohutnělo Hnutí pro Potírání Nemravnosti (HPN), přitom došlo k veřejným projevům a několik černochů bylo dílem pověšeno, dílem upáleno.","Endless is human omnipotence It was not enough for Professor J. W. Hopkins (Yale Un.), The largest authority in the field of reptiles at the time, to declare those mysterious creatures an unscientific hype and mere imagination. unknown animals, similar to giant salamanders, in various parts of the Pacific Ocean. Relatively reliable data showed deposits on the Solomon Islands, Schoutenov Island, Kapingamarangi, Butaritari and Tapeteuea, as well as on the whole group of islets: Nukufetau, Fanufuti, Nukonono and Fukaofu, then to Hiau, Uahuka, Uapu and Pukapuka. Rumors of Captain van Toch's devils (mainly in the Melanesian region) and Miss Lily's tritons (rather in Polynesia) were quoted, and the newspaper concluded that they were probably different types of underwater and pre-flood monsters, especially since the summer season had come and nothing was happening. write. Underwater monsters tend to be a great success for readers. Especially in the USA, tritons came into vogue, in New York the three-story narrative Poseidon was performed with three hundred of the most beautiful tritons, nereids and sirens, in Miami and on California beaches, young people bathed in costumes of tritons and nereids (ie three strings of pearls and nothing more). ), while in the Central and Midwestern states, the Injust Fighting Movement (HPN) has become extremely enriched, with public speeches and several blacks being hanged, burned.","The inquisitiveness of man is boundless. It was not enough that Professor J. W. Hopkins (Yale University), the greatest authority of the day in the field of herpatology, had declared these mysterious creatures to be unscientific humbug and mere fantasy; both the specialist and the general press began to report frequent discoveries of these previously unknown animals, resembling giant newts, in all parts of the Pacific Ocean. Relatively reliable reports came from the Solomon Isles, Schoutoen Island, Kapingamarang, Butarit and Tapeteuea, and then further reports came from entire archipelagoes: Nudufetau, Fanufuti, Nukonono and Fukaofu, and then from Kiau, Uahuka, Uapu and Pukapuka. Rumours about Captain van Toch's demons and Miss Lily's tritons circulated around Melanesia and Polynesia respectively; and the papers judged there must be various kinds of underwater and prehistoric monsters, especially as the summer had begun and there was nothing else to write about. The underwater monsters were especially successful among their readers and tritons became the height of fashion in the USA that season; a spectacular revue called Poseidon was performed three hundred times in New York with three hundred of the most beautiful tritonesses and syrens; on the beaches of Miami and California young people bathed in costumes of tritons and nayads (ie. three strings of pearls and nothing else), while in the states of the midwest the Movement for the Suppression of Immorality gained enormously in numbers; there were public demonstrations and several negroes were hanged or burned alive.","There is no limit to human curiosity. It was not enough for Professor J. W. Hopkins (Yale), the greatest living authority on reptiles, to declare those mysterious creatures to be an unscientific hoax and pure fantasy; an increasing number of reports began to appear both in specialised publications and in the daily press of the discovery of hitherto unknown animals, resembling giant salamanders, in the most various parts of the Pacific. Relatively reliable data referred to such discoveries in the Solomon Islands, on Schouten Island, on Kapingamarangi, Butarita and Tapeteuea, as well as on a whole group of lesser islands: Nukufetau, Funafuti, Nukonono and Fukaofu, and finally on Hiau, Uahuka, Uapu and Pukapuka. There were the legends of Captain van Toch’s devils (mainly in the Melanesian region) and of Miss Lily’s Tritons (more usually in Polynesia); so the papers concluded that these were probably different kinds of submarine and antediluvian monsters, especially as the silly season had begun and there was nothing else to write about. Submarine monsters are a sure-fire success with the reading public. In the United States, in particular, Tritons became fashionable; in New York the lavish review featuring Poseidon, with 300 of the prettiest girl Tritons, Nereids and Sirens ran to 300 performances; in Miami and on the Californian beaches young people wore Triton and Nereid swimsuits (i.e. three strings of pearls and nothing else), while in the Midwestern states and the Bible Belt the Movement for the Suppression of Immorality (MSI) recorded an extraordinary increase in support; in this connection mass demonstrations took place and a number of negroes were either hanged or burnt to death."

"Zatím samice setrvává po nějakou dobu ve své ustrnulé, nehybné pozici, potom se silně prohne a počne vypuzovat z kloaky zřetězená vajíčka, opatřená rosolovitým obalem, často si při tom napomáhá zadníma nohama, jak to činívají ropuchy. Těch vajíček je čtyřicet až padesát a visí na těle samice jako chomáč. S nimi pluje samice na chráněná místa a upevní je na řasy, na chaluhy nebo i jenom na kameny. Po deseti dnech snese samice druhou sérii vajíček v počtu dvaceti až třiceti, aniž se v té době setkala se samcem, patrně ta vajíčka byla oplodněna přímo v její kloace. Zpravidla po dalších sedmi až osmi dnech dojde k třetímu a čtvrtému kladení po patnácti až dvaceti vajíčkách vesměs oplozených, ze kterých se po jednom až třech týdnech vylíhnou čilí pulčíci s větévkovitými žábrami. Už po roce tito pulci dorůstají v dospělé mloky a mohou se dále rozplozovat atd.","Meanwhile, the female remains in her stiff, motionless position for some time, then bends sharply and begins to expel chained eggs, which have a jelly-like shell, from the cloaca, often helping her hind legs, as toads do. There are forty to fifty of those eggs and they hang on the female's body like a bunch. Females sail with them to protected places and fasten them to algae, seaweed or even just stones. After ten days, the female laid the second series of eggs in the number of twenty to thirty, without meeting the male at that time, apparently the eggs were fertilized directly in her cloaca. As a rule, after another seven to eight days, the third and fourth laying will take place after fifteen to twenty eggs, mostly fertilized, from which lively tadpoles with branched gills hatch after one to three weeks. After only a year, these tadpoles grow into adult salamanders and can continue to spawn, etc.","The female will remain for some time in her stiff and motionless posture; she will then show vigorous movement and discharge from her cloaca a chain of eggs inside a gelatinous covering, making frequent use of her rear limbs to assist this process in the way seen among toads. The eggs number between forty and fifty and hang from the female's body. She will swim with them to a safe place and attach them to seaweed, algae or simply to a rock. After a period of ten days, the female will bear another litter of twenty to thirty eggs without any union with the male having taken place; it seems clear that the eggs were fertilised within the cloaca. There will usually be a third and a fourth discharge of eggs after a period of seven or eight days, each of fifteen to twenty eggs variously fertilised. The feather-gilled tadpoles will emerge after a gestation period of between one and three weeks. The tadpoles grow into adult newts after just one year and are able to reproduce in their turn.","The female, meanwhile, remains for some time in her rigid, motionless position; then she arches her body vigorously and begins to expel from her cloaca concatenated eggs in a gelatinous sheath; in this she often assists herself with her hindlegs, in the manner of toads. These eggs number from forty to fifty and hang from the female like a tuft. With these eggs the female swims to sheltered spots and there attaches them to algae, seaweed or just stones. Ten days later the same female lays another set of eggs, numbering from twenty to thirty, although she has not been in contact with the male during that period; evidently these eggs were fertilised directly in her cloaca. As a rule a third and a fourth batch of eggs are laid after a further seven or eight days and fifteen to twenty days respectively; these range from fifteen to twenty in number. Within a period from one to three weeks agile tadpoles hatch out, with finely branched gills. After a year these tadpoles grow into adult Newts and are capable of further propagation."
"Protože blokáda britských břehů na moři byla úplná, zbývala Anglii jenom jedna volná cesta pro zásobování a styk s osadami, a sice vzduchem. ""Musíme Mít Sto Tisíc Letadel,"" hlásal ministr letectví, a všechno, co mělo ruce a nohy, se dalo do služeb tohoto hesla, konaly se horečné přípravy k tomu, aby se mohlo denně vyrábět tisíc letadel, ale tu zakročily vlády ostatních evropských mocí s ostrým protestem proti tomuto porušování letecké rovnováhy, britská vláda musela od svého vzdušného programu upustit a zavázat se, že nepostaví víc než dvacet tisíc letadel, a to ještě do pěti let. Nezbylo tedy než hladovět dál nebo platit horentní ceny za potraviny, které byly dodávány aviony jiných států, libra chleba stála deset šilinků, párek krys jednu guineu, krabička kaviáru dvacet pět liber sterlingů. Prostě byly to zlaté časy pro kontinentální obchod, průmysl a zemědělství.","Because the blockade of the British coasts at sea was complete, England had only one free way to supply and contact the settlements, namely the air. ""We must have One Hundred Thousand Aircraft,"" said the Minister of Aviation, and everything that had hands and feet was put in the service of this slogan, feverish preparations were made to produce a thousand aircraft a day, but the governments of other European powers intervened. with fierce protest against this imbalance, the British government had to abandon its air program and commit not to build more than 20,000 aircraft within five years. So all that was left was to starve or pay exorbitant prices for food delivered by avions of other states, a pound of bread cost ten shillings, a pair of rats one guinea, a box of caviar twenty-five pounds sterling. These were simply golden times for continental trade, industry and agriculture.","The blockade of British coasts was total, and so England was left with only one way of obtaining supplies and maintaining communications, and that was by air. “We need a hundred thousand aircraft,” the minister for aviation declared, and all forces were applied to fulfilling this edict; but then the governments of other European powers raised bitter protests that this would disturb the balance of power in the skies; the government of the United Kingdom would have to abandon its plans and promise never to build more than twenty thousand aircraft and even that not within the next five years. They would simply have to remain hungry or pay horrifying prices for foodstuffs supplied by the aircraft of other states; a loaf of bread cost ten shillings, a rat sausage one guinea, a box of caviar twenty-five pounds sterling. This was simply a golden age for business, industry and agriculture on the continent.","Because the blockade of the British sea coasts was complete, Britain was left with but one way of importing supplies and maintaining contact with the colonies, and that was by air. ‘We must have 100,000 aircraft,’ the Air Minister announced, and anyone possessing hands and feet placed themselves in the service of that slogan. Feverish preparations were made to ensure a daily output of 1,000 aircraft; but that was where the governments of the other European states intervened with sharp protests against a violation of the balance in the air; the British government had to desist from its air programme and undertake not to build more than 20,000 aircraft, and that only over a period of five years. So there was no alternative to continuing to go hungry or to paying horrendous prices for foodstuffs supplied by the aircraft of other countries; a pound loaf cost ten shillings, a brace of rats one guinea, a tin of caviare twenty-five pounds.

Ale když už jsme u těch otázek: je britské admiralitě známo i to, že baltští Mloci jsou opatřeni strojem jinak mírumilovným, který se jmenuje pneumatická vrtačka, a že tato nejmodernější vrtačka se za jednu hodinu zakusuje do hloubky deseti metrů v nejlepší švédské žule a do hloubky padesáti až šedesáti metrů v anglické křídě? (Dokázaly to pokusné vrty, které tajně podnikla německá technická expedice v noci dne 11"" 12. a 13. minulého měsíce na anglickém pobřeží mezi Hythe a Folkestonem, tedy přímo před nosem pevnosti doverské.) Doporučujeme svým přátelům za Kanálem, aby si sami spočítali, za kolik týdnů může být Kent nebo Essex provrtán pod hladinou mořskou dírami jako bochník sýra. Do této doby pohlížel britský ostrovan starostlivě k obloze, odkud prý může přijít jediná zkáza jeho kvetoucím městům, jeho Bank of England nebo jeho pokojným kotážím, tak útulným ve věčně zeleném rámci břečťanu. Ať nyní přiloží raději ucho k zemi, na níž si hrají jeho děti: nezaslechne v ní dnes nebo zítra skřípat a krok za krokem se hlouběji zažírat neúnavný a strašlivý nebozez mločí vrtačky, razící cestu pro nálože dosud nevídaných třaskavin? Ne už válka ve vzduchu, ale válka pod vodou a pod zemí je poslední slovo našeho věku. Slyšeli jsme sebevědomá slova z kapitánského můstku pyšného Albionu, ano, dosud je to mocný koráb, který se vznáší na vlnách a ovládá je, ale jednou by se ty vlny mohly zavřít nad lodí rozmetanou a klesající do mořských hlubin. Nebylo by lépe čelit tomu nebezpečí raději dřív? Do tří let bude na to už příliš pozdě!","It's hard to imagine, Marquis de Sade continued, in the next war, salamanders armed with submarine berts, mortars and torpedoes to block the shores, for example, for the first time in world history, no one has to envy England for its great island location. But speaking of issues: the British Admiralty is also aware that the Baltic Newts are equipped with an otherwise peaceful machine called a pneumatic drill, and that this state-of-the-art drill bites to a depth of ten meters in the best Swedish granite and depths of fifty to sixty meters in the English Cretaceous? (This was proved by experimental wells secretly undertaken by a German technical expedition on the night of the 11th, 12th and 13th of the last month on the English coast between Hythe and Folkestone, right in front of the Dover Fortress.) We encourage our friends behind the Canal to count In how many weeks Kent or Essex can be drilled under the seaholes like a loaf of cheese. If he now prefers to put his ear to the ground where his children are playing: will he not hear the creaking in it today or tomorrow, and step by step dig in the tireless and terrible sky of the newt drills, paving the way for loads of unprecedented explosives? war in the air, but war under water and underground is the last word of our age, we have heard confident words from the captain's bridge of the proud Albion, yes, it is still a powerful ship the hover floats on the waves and controls them, but one day the waves could close over the ship scattered and descending into the depths of the sea. Wouldn't it be better to face the danger sooner? It will be too late in three years!","It is not difficult to imagine , the Marquis de Sade continued, what a difference could be made to the outcome the next war by newts blockading the coasts and equipped with underwater howitzers, mortars and torpedoes; by my faith, this is the first time in history that no-one need envy the English in their splendid isolation surrounded by water. And while we are addressing these questions: is the British admiralty aware also that the Baltic newts are equipped with a new, normally peaceful, apparatus called the pneumatic drill which is capable of drilling ten metres deep into the best Swedish granite in an hour and can penetrate fifty or sixty metres deep into English chalk in the same time? (This was ascertained by secret experiments carried out at night by the German technical expedition on the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth of last month on the English coast between Hythe and Folkestone right under the nose of Dover Castle.) I suggest that our friends across the channel calculate for themselves how many weeks it would take for Kent or Essex to be drilled through below sea level like a piece of Swiss cheese. Until now, the Englishman on his island has always looked anxiously to the horizon as the place from which any harm to his flourishing cities, his Bank of England or his warm cottage, so cosy in its evergreen coat of ivy, might come. But now he had better put his ear to the ground where his children are playing: might he not hear, maybe today, maybe tomorrow, a digging and a scraping as, step by step, the newts with these tireless and fearsome drills grind their way deeper to create the paths for laying hitherto unknown explosives. The last word of the age we live in is not war in the air, it is war beneath the water and the land. We have heard the self confident words from the commanders of proud Albion; the ship of Albion today is still a vessel of great power, borne on the waves and master of them; but there might come a day when the waves will close over a vessel that has been broken and send it down to the depths of the ocean. Would it not be better to face this danger sooner rather than later? Within three years it will be too late!","It is not difficult, the Marquis de Sade continued, to visualise the importance of the Newts in any future war: equipped with underwater Big Berthas, mortars and torpedoes for blockading any coasts. God knows, for the first time in world history no one need envy Britain her splendid island situation. But while we are on the subject, is the British Admiralty aware that the Baltic Newts are equipped with a normally very peaceful instrument known as the pneumatic drill? And that this drill can cut ten metres deep into the best Swedish granite in an hour, or to a depth of fifty to sixty metres in English chalk? (This was proved by trial borings secretly conducted by a German technical expedition during the nights of the 11th, 12th and 13th of last month on the English coast between Hythe and Folkestone, right under the nose of the fortifications at Dover.) We would advise our friends across the Channel to work out for themselves how many weeks it would take for Kent or Essex to become riddled with holes below sea level like a chunk of cheese. Hitherto the British islander has been anxiously watching the skies, the only direction from where he thought disaster might come to his flourishing cities, to his Bank of England or to his peaceful cottages, snug under their perpetual green cover of ivy. Let him now press his ear to the ground instead, the ground on which his children are playing: will he not hear, if not today then tomorrow, the grinding sound, the crunching progress, inch by inch, of the tireless and terrible cutting head of the Newts’ drills, boring holes for as yet unheard-of explosive charges? No longer the war in the air but a war under water and underground is the latest marvel of our age. We heard some self-assured words from the captain’s bridge of proud Albion: yes, she still is a mighty ship riding the waves and ruling them; yet one day these waves might close over a ship blown to smithereens and sinking to the depths of the sea. Would it not be wiser to oppose this danger in time? Three years from now it will be too late!"

"Začátkem dubna, vypravuje H. Bolte, se přidružují samci k samičkám, v každém sexuálním období se drží samec zpravidla téže samice a neopouští jí ani na krok po několik dnů. V té době nepřijímá žádné potravy, zatímco samice projevuje značnou žravost. Samec ji prohání ve vodě a snaží se, aby se dostal hlavou těsně k její hlavě. Když se mu to podaří, předsune svou tlamu maličko před její čenich, snad aby jí zabránil v útěku, a ustrne. Takto, dotýkajíce se jenom hlavami, zatímco jejich těla svírají úhel asi třicetistupňový, plovou obě zvířata bez hnutí podle sebe. Chvílemi se samec počne svíjeti tak silně, že naráží svými boky na boky samice, nato opět ustrne, nohy široce roztaženy, dotýkaje se jen svou tlamou hlavy své vyvolené družky, která zatím lhostejně požírá, co potká. Tento, smíme-li tak říci, polibek trvá několik dní, někdy se samice utrhne za potravou, a tu ji samec pronásleduje, zřejmě velmi rozčilen, ba téměř rozlícen. Konečně se samice vzdá dalšího odporu, neprchá již, a párek se vznáší ve vodě bez hnutí, podoben černým, k sobě připoutaným polenům. Tu počnou tělem samcovým probíhat křečovité záchvěvy, během nichž vypouští do vody hojný, poněkud lepkavý chám. Hned nato opouští samici a zalézá mezi kameny, do krajnosti vyčerpán, v té době lze mu uříznout nohu nebo ocas, aniž na to obranně reagoval.","At the beginning of April, says H. Bolte, males join females; in each sexual period, the male usually stays with the same female and does not leave her for a step for several days. At that time, she does not eat any food, while the female shows considerable gluttony. The male chases her in the water, trying to get his head close to her head. If he succeeds, he pushes his mouth a little in front of her snout, perhaps to prevent her from escaping, and stagnates. Thus, touching only their heads as their bodies form an angle of about thirty degrees, the two animals float motionless. At times, the male begins to writhe so hard that he strikes the female's hips with his hips, then stiffens again, his legs spread wide, touching only with his mouth the head of his chosen companion, who is still indifferently eating what he encounters. This, so to speak, the kiss lasts for several days, sometimes the female pulls for food, and here the male chases her, apparently very upset, almost angry. Finally, the female gives up further resistance, no longer flees, and the sausage floats in the water motionless, like black, chained logs. This is where the male's body begins to have convulsive tremors, during which it releases abundant, somewhat sticky bugs into the water. Immediately afterwards, he leaves the female and crawls among the stones, exhausted to the extreme, at which time his leg or tail can be cut off without reacting defensively.","According to the account given by H. Bolte, the male and female come together in early April; the male will usually remain with just one female throughout any one mating season, and for a period of several days will never leave her side. He will take no sustenance during this period, whereas the female will evince a voracious appetite. The male will pursue the female in the water and attempt to keep his head closely beside hers. If he is successful in this, then he will position his paw in front of her snout in order to prevent escape. He will then become stiff. In this way, with male and female in contact only at the head while their bodies form an angle of approximately thirty degrees, the two animals will float motionless side by side in the water. After a short time has elapsed, the male will begin to convulse with sufficient vigour for their two bodies to collide; after which he will again become stiff, his limbs extended to each side, and touching only the head of his chosen mate with his paw. During this, the female shows a total indifference apart from eating whatever comes within range. This, if we may call it thus, kissing lasts several days; at times the female will pull herself away in pursuit of food, at which the male will pursue in a state of clear agitation if not fury. Eventually the female ceases to show further resistance or attempt to remove herself from the male and the couple will remain floating motionless, resembling a pair of black logs attached to each other in the water. The body of the male will then begin to undergo cramps and convulsions, during which he will discharge large amounts of somewhat sticky foam into the water, immediately after which he will abandon the female and climb away between the rocks and stones in a state of extreme exhaustion; during this period it is possible for the observer to cut off a leg or tail without his showing any kind of defensive reaction.","In early April, H. Bolte records, the males associate with the females; in each sexual period the male as a rule sticks to the same female and, for a number of days, does not leave it even for a moment. During that time he takes in no food, whereas the female exhibits considerable voracity. The male pursues her in the water, trying to get his head close to hers. When he has succeeded in this he shoves his mouth a little way in front of her snout, possibly to prevent her from escaping, and becomes motionless. Thus, touching only with their heads while their bodies form an angle of about thirty degrees, the two animals float alongside each other without any movement. From time to time the male begins to writhe so violently that his flank strikes that of the female; thereupon he again becomes motionless, his legs wide apart, with only his mouth touching the head of his chosen mate who, meanwhile, with complete indifference, feeds on whatever she encounters. This, if we may so call it, kiss continues for several days; sometimes the female will tear herself away in her search for food, and the male will then pursue her in evident agitation and even anger. At last the female ceases any further resistance, she no longer tries to escape, and the pair float motionless in the water, like two dark logs lashed together. At that point the male’s body is shaken by convulsive tremors, in the course of which he emits a copious, somewhat sticky sperm into the water. Immediately afterwards he leaves the female and hides away among the rocks, utterly exhausted; in that state his leg or tail might be cut off without defensive reaction on his part."

"Daleko větší štěstí nám přálo na ostrově Tongarewa. Čekali jsme na pobřeží s puškami v rukou. Po západu slunce se vynořily z vody hlavy mloků, poměrně veliké a mírně zploštělé. Po chvíli vylezli mloci na písek, kráčejíce kolébavě, ale dosti mrštně po zadních nohách. Vsedě byli vysocí něco přes metr. Rozsadili se v širokém kruhu a počali zvláštním pohybem kroužit hoření polovinou těla, vypadalo to, jako by tančili. W. Kleinschmidt povstal, aby lépe viděl. Tu mloci k němu obrátili hlavy a na krátký okamžik úplně strnuli, potom se k němu počali se značnou rychlostí blížit, vydávajíce sykavé a štěkavé zvuky. Když byli od něho asi na sedm kroků, střelili jsme do nich z pušek. Dali se velmi rychle na útěk a vrhli se do moře, toho večera se už neukázali. Na břehu zůstali jenom dva mloci mrtví a jeden s přeraženou páteří, který vydával zvláštní zvuk, jako ""ogod, ogod, ogod"". Později skonal, když W. Kleinschmidt otevřel nožem jeho dutinu plicní... (Následují anatomické podrobnosti, kterým bychom my laikové stejně nerozuměli, i odkazujeme odborné čtenáře na citovaný bulletin.)","We wished us far more happiness on the island of Tongarewa. We waited on the shore with rifles in our hands. After sunset, the heads of salamanders emerged from the water, quite large and slightly flattened. After a while, the salamanders climbed onto the sand, walking wobbly but quite agilely on their hind legs. They sat just over a meter tall. They spread out in a wide circle and began circling the burning half of their bodies in a strange motion, looking as if they were dancing. W. Kleinschmidt rose to see better. The salamanders turned their heads to him and froze completely for a moment, then began to approach him with considerable speed, making hissing and barking noises. When they were about seven paces from him, we fired rifles at them. They fled very quickly and plunged into the sea, no longer showing up that evening. Only two salamanders remained on shore, and one with a broken spine, which made a strange sound, like ""ogod, ogod, ogod."" It later ended when W. Kleinschmidt opened his pulmonary cavity with a knife ... (The following are anatomical details that we laymen would not understand anyway, and we refer professional readers to the cited bulletin.)","We met with much greater success, however, on the island of Tongarewa. We waited on the foreshore with our guns in our hands. Soon after sunset, the head of a newt emerged from the water, relatively large and slightly flattened. After a short while the newts climbed out onto the sand, swaying as they walked on their hind legs but nonetheless quite agile. When sitting they were just over three feet in height. They sat around in a wide circle and began making distinctive and vigorous circling movements of the upper parts of their bodies, giving the impression that they were dancing. W. Kleinschmidt stood up in order to obtain a better view. At this, the newts turned to look at him and soon were entirely stiff and motionless; they then began with remarkable speed to approach him, uttering sibilant barking sounds. When they were about seven paces away we opened fire on them. They fled, very quickly, and threw themselves into the sea; they were not seen again that evening. On the shore, there remained no more than two dead newts and one newt with a broken spine, uttering an odd sound, something like ogod, ogod, ogod. It then expired after W. Kleinschmidt used a knife to open its pulmonary cavity...

"... Na ostrově Rakahanga se výprava poprvé setkala s otisky zadních noh dosud neznámého obrovského mloka. Otisky jsou pětiprsté, délka prstů 3 až 4 cm. Podle počtu šlépějí se musí pobřeží ostrova Rakahanga těmito mloky přímo hemžit. Protože tu nebylo otisků předních noh (až na jeden čtyřprstý otisk, patrně mláděte), usoudila výprava, že tito mloci se patrně pohybují po zadních končetinách.","... On the island of Rakahanga, the expedition first encountered the footprints of a hitherto unknown giant salamander. The prints are five-fingered, finger length 3 to 4 cm. Depending on the number of footprints, the coast of Rakahanga Island must be teeming with these salamanders. Since there were no forefeet prints (except for one four-toed fingerprint, probably a cub), the expedition concluded that these salamanders were probably moving on their hind legs.","...On the island of Rakahanga the expedition first encountered prints left by the rear legs of a hitherto unknown species of newt. The prints show five toes, between three and four centimetres long. The number of prints left shows that the coast around the island must have been swarming with these newts. There were no prints of front legs (apart from one set of four, clearly left by a juvenile), showing clearly that these newt move about on their rear limbs.","On Rakahanga Island the expedition for the first time encountered the imprints of the hind-feet of an unknown giant salamander. The imprints show five digits with a toe length of 3 to 4 cm. Judging by the number of tracks the coast of Rakahanga Island would seem to be literally swarming with those salamanders. Because of the absence of fore-feet imprints (except for one four-digit print, apparently of a young specimen) the expedition concluded that these salamanders evidently move on their hindlegs."

"S těmi Kokosovými čili Keelingovými ostrovy to bylo tak: Připlula tam kořistná loď Montrose známé Harrimanovy společnosti Pacific Trade pod kapitánem Jamesem Lindleyem na obvyklý lov Mloků typu zvaného Maccaroni. Na Kokosových ostrovech byla známá a bohatá mločí zátoka, osazená ještě kapitánem van Tochem, ale pro svou odlehlost ponechaná, jak se říká, pánubohu. Kapitánu Lindleyovi nelze vytýkat žádnou neopatrnost, ani to ne, že posádka vystoupila na břeh neozbrojena. (Tehdy totiž měl loupežný obchod s Mloky už své regulérní formy, pravda ovšem je, že předtím bývaly korzárské lodi a posádky vyzbrojeny kulomety, ano i lehkými děly, ne sice proti Salamandrům, ale proti nekalé konkurenci druhých pirátů. Na ostrově Karakelong se však jednou srazila posádka Harrimanova parníku s mužstvem dánské lodi, jejíž kapitán považoval Karakelong za své loviště, tehdy si obě posádky vyřídily své staré účty, zejména své prestižní a obchodní rozpory, tím, že nechaly lovu Mloků a začaly do sebe pálit z pušek a hotchkissů, Dánové to sice na souši vyhráli útokem na nože, ale Harrimanova loď potom ostřelovala úspěšně ze svých kanónů loď dánskou a potopila ji se vším všudy, i s kapitánem Nielsem - takzvaný Karakelong-incident. Tehdy se do věci musely vložit i úřady a vlády příslušných států, banditským lodím bylo nadále zakázáno užívat děl, kulometů a ručních granátů, mimoto se flibustýrské společnosti rozdělily o takzvaná volná loviště, takže každá mločí lokalita byla navštěvována jenom určitou loupežnickou lodí, toto gentlemen's agreement velkých pirátů bylo opravdu dodržováno a respektováno i od malých loupežných podnikatelů.) Ale abychom se vrátili ke kapitánu Lindleyovi, jednal zcela v duchu tehdy běžných obchodních i námořních zvyklostí, když na Kokosových ostrovech vyslal své lidi na lov Mloků ozbrojené jenom klacky a vesly, a potomní úřední vyšetřování dalo mrtvému kapitánovi satisfakci.","With the Cocos or Keeling Islands, it was like this: the prey ship Montrose of the well-known Harriman company Pacific Trade, under Captain James Lindley, arrived there for the usual hunting of Newts of the Maccaroni type. There was a well-known and rich salamander bay on the Cocos Islands, still manned by Captain van Toch, but for its remoteness, as it is said, left to God. Captain Lindley cannot be blamed for carelessness, not even for the crew coming ashore unarmed. (At that time, the robber trade with Newts already had its regular forms, but the truth is that before that corsair ships and crews used to be armed with machine guns, yes and light cannons, not against Salamanders, but against unfair competition from other pirates. the crew of Harriman's steamer collided with the crew of a Danish ship, whose captain considered Karakelong his fishing ground, at which time both crews settled their old accounts, especially their prestigious and commercial conflicts, by letting Newts hunt down and firing rifles and hotchkiss at each other. Harriman's ship then successfully shelled a Danish ship from its cannons and sank it with everything, including Captain Niels, the so-called Karakelong incident. ships continued to be banned from using artillery, machine guns and hand grenades, and flibus companies split into so-called free hunting grounds, so This gentlemen's agreement of the great pirates was indeed observed and respected even by the small robbers.) But to return to Captain Lindley, he acted in the spirit of the then common business and naval customs when he sent his people to the Cocos Islands to Newt hunting armed only with sticks and oars, and a subsequent official investigation gave the dead captain satisfaction.","On the Coconut Isles, or Keeling Isles, this is what happened: The Montrose, a raiding ship operated by Harriman's Pacific Trade Company and under the captaincy of James Lindley, sailed in for one of its usual newt gathering expeditions of the sort known as a Macaroni Run. The Coconut Isles were well known for a bay with a large newt population settled there by Captain van Toch himself but which, because of its remoteness, was left, as they say, to its own devices. No-one could accuse Captain Lindley of any lack of care and attention, not even in that the men who went on shore were not armed. (At that time the trade in hunting newts had already taken on a standard form; it is true, of course, that the pirate ships had earlier used to equip themselves with machine guns and even light cannons, although they were not intended for use against the newts but against unfair competition from other pirates. One day however, off the island of Karakelong, one of Harrimans steamers came up against a Danish ship whose captain considered the hunting grounds of Karakelong as his territory; so the two sides settled some old accounts to do with their prestige and some trading disputes by leaving the newts alone and starting to fire at each other with their rifles and Hotchkiss guns; on land, victory went to the Danes after their successful knife attack but the Harriman ship then had its success by firing its cannons at the Danish ship and sinking it with all hands, including Captain Nielsen. This became known as the Karakelong Incident. So then governments and officials of the relevant countries had to become involved; pirate ships were from then on forbidden to use cannons, machine guns or hand grenades; the companies involved also allocated what they called the free hunting ground among themselves so that any one newt settlement would only ever be visited by a certain raiding ship; this gentleman's agreement among the great pirates was adhered to and respected even by the smallest raiding businesses.) But to return to Captain Lindley, he conducted himself entirely in accordance with commercial and marine practices of the time when he sent his men out to gather newts armed only with sticks and oars, and the later official enquiry gave the dead captain full satisfaction in that respect.","The business on the Cocos or Keeling Islands happened like this. The raiding ship Montrose of the well-known Harriman Pacific Trade Company under Captain James Lindley arrived there on its regular hunt for Newts of the so-called Macaroni type. There was a well-known and rich Newt colony in a bay of the Cocos Islands, established at the time by Captain van Toch but, because of its remote situation, was abandoned, as the saying is, to the care of the Good Lord. No one could accuse Captain Lindley of having been in any way negligent, not even in allowing his crew to go ashore unarmed. (The point is that by then the piratical Newt trade had acquired its regularised form. It is true, of course, that in the early days corsair ships and their crews had been armed with machine-guns, and indeed with field guns, not against the salamanders but against unfair competition from other pirates. On Karakelong Island, a landing party from a Harriman steamship had on one occasion clashed with the crew of a Danish ship whose captain had regarded Karakelong as his hunting ground; on that occasion both parties had settled their old scores, and more particularly their prestige and commercial differences by forgetting the Newt hunt and instead opening up at each other with their rifles and Hotchkisses. The Danes had won on land by making a knife charge, but the Harriman steamship had subsequently fired her guns at the Danish ship and succeeded in sinking her with all hands, complete with Captain Niels. That became known as the Karakelong incident. The authorities and governments of the two countries had to intervene at that time, and pirate ships were henceforward forbidden to use heavy guns, machine-guns or hand-grenades. Moreover, the pirate companies divided the so-called free hunting grounds amongst themselves in such a way that each locality was visited by one particular pirate ship only. That gentleman’s agreement between the big pirates was actually kept and was respected also by lesser piratical entrepreneurs.) But to return to Captain Lindley. He was acting entirely in the spirit of the customary commercial and naval conventions of his day when he sent his men ashore on the Cocos Islands to hunt for Newts armed only with clubs and oars. Indeed the subsequent inquiry fully exonerated the dead captain."
"Kapitán J. van Toch se díval zamyšleně na třesoucího se malého potápěče. Ten hoch už nikdy nebude k ničemu, řekl si, pošlu ho z Padangu domů na Cejlon. Bruče a funě šel do své kabiny. Tam vysypal z papírového sáčku na stůl dvě perly. Jedna byla maličká jako zrnko písku a druhá jako hrách, lesknoucí se stříbřitě a do růžova. A kapitán holandské lodi zafrkal a vyňal ze skřínky svou irskou whisky.","Captain J. van Toch looked thoughtfully at the trembling little diver. The boy will never be useless again, he told himself, I'll send him home from Padang to Ceylon. He grunted and went to his cabin. There he poured two pearls from a paper bag onto the table. One was tiny as a grain of sand and the other as a pea, glistening silvery and pink. And the captain of the Dutch ship snorted and took his Irish whiskey out of the locker.","Captain J. van Toch looked thoughtfully at the little diver as he sat there shivering. Hell be no good for anything from now on, the said to himself, he would send him to Padang and back on home to Ceylon. Grumbling and snorting, the captain went to his cabin, where he spilled the two pearls out onto the table from a paper bag. One of them was as small as a grain of sand and the other as a pea, with a shimmer of silver and pink. And with that, the captain of the Dutch ship, Kandong Bandoeng, snorted; and then he reached into the cupboard for his bottle of Irish whiskey.","Captain van Toch gazed thoughtfully at the trembling little diver.

"(Pokusy slečny Kistemaeckers doplnil zajímavými experimenty učený abbé Bontempelli. Usušil a rozemlel mlíčí Andriasovo a přidal je samicím do vody, i nyní samice se jaly snášeti oplozená vajíčka. Týž výsledek byl, když usušil a rozemlel samčí ústrojí Andriasovo nebo když je extrahoval lihem nebo vyvařil a vlil extrakt do nádrže samic. Totéž se stejným výsledkem opakoval s výtažkem mozkové hypofýzy, a dokonce s výměšky kožních žláz Andriasových, vymačkaných v době říje. Ve všech těchto případech samice zprvu nereagovaly na tyto přísady, teprve po chvíli přestaly rejdit za potravou a utkvěly nehnutě, ba přímo strnule ve vodě, načež po několika hodinách se počalo vypuzování rosolovitých, asi jako sviňský bob velikých vajíček.)","(Miss Kistemaeckers' experiments were supplemented by interesting experiments taught by Abbot Bontempelli. He dried and ground Andrias's milk and added them to the water for the females, and even now the females began to lay the fertilized eggs.

He obtained the same result if he dried and powdered Andrias's male organ or if he took an extract in alcohol or by infusion and poured it into the female's water. He tried the same experiment, with the same result, when he took an extract of the male's pituitary gland and even when he took a scraping from the males skin, if taken in the rutting season. In all these cases, the females did not respond at first, but after a while they stopped seeking food and became stiff and motionless in the water, then after some hours they began to discharge eggs in a gelatinous coating, each about the size of pig's droppings.)","(Miss Kistemaeckers’ experiments were supplemented by interesting experiments by the learned Abbé Bontempelli. He dried and ground up the sperm of Andrias and introduced the material into water containing females; in this case, too, the females began to lay fertile eggs.

He obtained the same result when he repeated the experiment with extracts of the cerebral hypophysis and even with extracts of the epidermal glands of Andrias, expressed when the animal was in heat.

Nato britští vojenští Salamandři počali pálit do francouzských mločích dělníků ručními granáty a minomety, takže francouzští Mloci byli nuceni užít stejných zbraní. Francouzská vláda se cítí donucena, aby žádala na vládě Jeho britského Veličenstva plnou satisfakci a vyklizení sporného podmořského úseku, jakož i ujištění, že se podobné případy nebudou napříště opakovat.","It seems that on a critical day, a working convoy of British Salamanders and French salamanders met in the middle of the Channel at the bottom of the sea, and that there was a misunderstanding between them. On the French side, it was claimed that their peaceful Newts had been attacked by the British, who wanted to drive them away; Then the British military salamanders began firing on French salamanders with hand grenades and mortars, so that the French Newts were forced to use the same weapons. The French government feels compelled to ask His British Majesty's government for full satisfaction and evacuation of the disputed submarine section, as well as assurances that similar cases will not be repeated in the future.","It seems that on the critical day, a working colony of British newts came across French salamanders on the seabed in the middle of the strait and some kind of misunderstanding developed. The French insisted that their newts had been working peacefully when they were attacked by the British who wanted to repel them, that British armed newts had tried to abduct some French newts who, of course, had defended themselves. At this, British military salamanders began firing into French labouring newts with hand grenades and mortars so that the French newts were forced to use similar weapons. The government of France felt compelled to require full satisfaction from His Britannic Majesty's government and complete withdrawal from the disputed area of the seabed in order to ensure that no similar incident would occur again in the future.","It appears that on that critical day a working party of British Newts encountered some French salamanders on the sea-bed and that some disagreement arose between them. The French version was that their peacefully working Newts had been attacked by the British Newts who had tried to drive them off; the armed British Newts (it was claimed) had tried to drag some French Newts away with them, and these of course offered resistance. Thereupon the British military salamanders opened up at the French worker Newts with hand-grenades and trench-mortars, forcing the French Newts to resort to the same weapons. The French government felt obliged to demand full satisfaction from His Britannic Majesty’s Government as well as the evacuation of the contentious sector of sea-bed; it also required assurances that similar incidents would not be repeated."

"Barva kapitána van Tocha se počala rozpadat v brunátné skvrny. Nejprve nabízel vyvraždění všech Bataků na světě, potom slevil na tři sta kopanců a konečně by se byl spokojil s tím, že vycpe starostu pro koloniální muzeum v Amsterodamu, naproti tomu Batakové šli ze dvou set rupií na železnou pumpu s kolem a nakonec setrvali na tom, aby kapitán dal starostovi z titulu pokuty benzínový zapalovač.

(“Give it to him, Captain,” urged the half-cast of Cubanese and Portuguese, “I've got three cigarette lighters in my store, even if they don't have wicks.”) Thus, peace was restored on Tana Masa; but Captain J. van Toch now knew that the dignity of the white race was at stake.","Captain van Toch’s colour began to break up into russet blotches.

"""A tuhle Anglie,"" rozjímal otec Povondra, ""ta bude mít taky těžkosti. V Dolní sněmovně se mluvilo, že prý Velká Británie zůstává pozadu za ostatními státy v těhletěch vodních stavbách. Že prý jiné koloniální moci budují o překot nové břehy a pevniny, zatímco britská vláda ve své konzervativní nedůvěře k Mlokům - To je pravda, maminko. Angličani jsou hrozně konzervativní. Já jsem znal jednoho lokaje z britského vyslanectví, a ten ti za živého boha nevzal do huby naši českou tlačenku. Prý se to u nich nejí, a tak on to prý taky nebude jíst. Se nedivím, že je pak jiné státy předhoní."" Pan Povondra kýval vážně hlavou. ""A Francie rozšiřuje své břehy u Calais. Teď dělají noviny v Anglii randál, že jim Francie bude střílet přes Kanál, když se ten Kanál zúží. To mají z toho. Mohli sami rozšířit své břehy u Doveru a střílet na Francii.""","""And this England,"" Father Povondra mused, ""will be in trouble, too. It was said in the House of Commons that Britain was lagging behind other states in these waterworks. That other colonial powers were building new shores and lands, while the British government in its conservative distrust of Newts - That's right, Mom. The English are very conservative. and he will not eat it either. I am not surprised that other states will overtake them. "" Mr. Povondra nodded seriously. ""And France is expanding its banks near Calais. Now the newspapers in England are making a fuss that France will shoot them across the Channel as the Channel narrows. They get it. They could have expanded their banks at Dover themselves and shot at France.""","“And there's England, too, don't forget,” Mr. Povondra considered. “They're going to have their troubles, too. In the House of Commons they've been taking about how Great Britain will be left behind all the other states where water constructions are concerned. They say all the other colonial powers are building new shorelines and reclaiming new land all the time while the British government is too conservative and won't trust the newts. And that's quite true, mother. Very conservative they are, the English. I knew someone once who worked at the British embassy, and he would never let our Czech sausage past his lips, not for the life of him. Said they didn't eat it in England so he wouldn't eat it here. I'm not surprised other countries are getting ahead of them.” Mr. Povondra nodded his head earnestly. “And there's France extending its coastline out by Calais. So now there's panic on in England that the French might start shooting at them across the Channel if the Channel gets any narrower. That's what it comes to. There's nothing to stop them extending their own coast off Dover and then they should shoot at France.”","‘And England too,’ Papa Povondra meditated; ‘she’s in for trouble too. Someone’s been saying in the House of Commons that Great Britain’s lagging behind other countries in these underwater constructions. That other colonial powers are feverishly constructing new shorelines and continents, while the British Government, with its conservative mistrust of the Newts - That’s the truth, Mother. Those English are terribly conservative. I knew a footmen from the British Legation once and for the love of God he wouldn’t let a Czech liver sausage pass his lips. Said they didn’t eat that sort of stuff at home and so he wouldn’t eat it here either. No wonder other countries are overtaking them.’ Mr Povondra shook his head gravely. ‘ And France is extending her coast at Calais. Now the British papers are raising merry hell that France will be able to fire across the Channel if it gets narrower. That’s all they get out of it. They could extend their own coast at Dover and shoot at France.’"

"Tímto večerem se počalo podivínství kapitána J. van Tocha. Do kampongu se vrátil až s úsvitem, nepromluvil slova a dal se odvézt na loď, kde se zamkl ve své kabině až do večera. To ještě nebylo nikomu nápadné, neboť Kandong Bandoeng měla co nakládat z požehnání ostrova Tana Masa (kopra, pepř, kafr, gutaperča, palmový olej, tabák a pracovní síly), ale když dostal večer hlášení, že všechno zboží je uskladněno, zafuněl jenom a řekl: ""Člun. Do kampongu."" A vrátil se zase až s úsvitem. Švéd Jensen, který mu pomáhal na palubu, se ho jen tak ze zdvořilosti zeptal: ""Tak dnes se jede dál, kapitáne?"" Kapitán se otočil, jako by ho píchl do zadnice. ""Co ti je po tom?"" utrhl se. ""Hleď si svých zatracených věcí!"" Po celý den ležela Kandong Bandoeng na kotvách ve vzdálenosti jednoho uzlu od pobřeží Tana Masa a nedělala nic. S večerem se vyvalil kapitán ze své kabiny a kázal: ""Člun. Do kampongu."" Malý Řek Zapatis se za ním díval jedním okem slepým a druhým šilhavým. ""Mládenci,"" kokrhal, ""buď tam má náš starý holku, nebo se dočista zbláznil."" Švéd Jensen se zamračil. ""Co ti je po tom?"" utrhl se na Zapatise. ""Hleď si svých zatracených věcí!"" Potom s Islanďanem Gudmundsonem vzal malý člun a vesloval směrem k Devil Bay. Zůstali s člunem za balvany a čekali, co bude dál. V zátoce přecházel kapitán a zdálo se, že na někoho čeká, časem se zastavil a volal něco jako ts-ts-ts. ""Koukej,"" řekl Gudmundson a ukazoval na moře, nyní oslnivě rudé a zlaté západem slunce. Jensen napočítal dvě, tři, čtyři, šest ploutví ostrých jako kosinka, které se táhly do Devil Bay. ""Hergot,"" bručel Jensen, ""tady je těch žraloků!"" Co chvíli se taková kosinka ponořila, nad vodou sebou švihl ocas a ve vodě to prudce zavířilo. Tu začal kapitán J. van Toch na břehu zuřivě poskakovat, chrlil ze sebe kletby a hrozil žralokům pěstí. Potom se udělal krátký tropický soumrak a nad ostrovem vyplul měsíc, Jensen zabral vesly a přiblížil se s člunem ke břehu až na jeden furlong. Kapitán nyní seděl na balvanu a dělal ts-ts-ts. Něco se kolem něho hýbalo, ale co, to se nedalo dobře rozeznat. Vypadá to jako tuleni, myslel si Jensen, ale tuleni lezou jinak. Vynořovalo se to z vody mezi balvany a ťapalo to po břehu kolébavě jako pingvíni. Jensen tiše zavesloval a zastavil na půl furlongu od kapitána. Ano, kapitán něco povídá, ale co, tomu aby čert rozuměl, nejspíš je to malajsky nebo tamilsky. Rozkládá rukama, jako by něco házel těm tuleňům (ale nejsou to tuleni, ujišťoval se Jensen), a přitom brebentí čínsky nebo malajsky. V tu chvíli vyklouzlo Jensenovi z ruky zdvižené veslo a plesklo do vody. Kapitán zvedl hlavu, vstal a šel asi třicet kroků k vodě, najednou to začalo blýskat a práskat, kapitán pálil z browningu směrem ke člunu. Skoro současně to v zálivu zašumělo, zavířilo, zapleskalo, jako kdyby tisíc tuleňů skákalo do vody, ale to už se Jensen a Gudmundson opřeli do vesel a hnali svůj člun za nejbližší roh, až to svištělo. Když se vrátili na loď, neřekli nikomu ani slova. Tihle Seveřani dovedou přece jen mlčet. K ránu se vrátil kapitán, byl zachmuřený a rozlícený, ale neřekl ani slovo. Jen když mu Jensen pomáhal na palubu, setkaly se dva páry modrých očí chladným a zkoumavým pohledem.","This evening, Captain J. van Toch's weirdness began. He did not return to the camp until dawn, did not speak, and was taken to the ship, where he locked himself in his cabin until the evening. This was not yet conspicuous to anyone, as Kandong Bandoeng had something to do with the blessings of Tana Masa Island (dill, pepper, camphor, gutta-percha, palm oil, tobacco and labor), but when he received word in the evening that all goods were stored, only he said, ""Boat. To the camp."" And he came back at dawn. The Swede Jensen, who was helping him aboard, just politely asked him, ""So you're moving on today, Captain?"" The captain turned, as if stabbed him in the ass. ""What's the matter with you?"" he broke away. ""Take care of your damn things!"" Throughout the day, Kandong Bandoeng lay on anchors one node from the coast of Tana Masa and did nothing. In the evening, the captain rolled out of his cabin and preached, ""Boat. To the camp."" Little Greek Zapatis looked after him with one blind eye and the other squinting. ""Bachelors,"" he crowed, ""either our old girlfriend is there, or he's gone insane."" Swede Jensen frowned. ""What's the matter with you?"" he tore himself at Zapatis. ""Take care of your damn things!"" Then he and the Icelander Gudmundson took a small boat and rowed toward Devil Bay. They stayed with the boat behind the boulders and waited for what would happen next. The captain was crossing the bay and seemed to be waiting for someone, eventually stopping and calling something like ts-ts-ts. ""Look,"" Gudmundson said, pointing to the sea, now a dazzling red and gold sunset. Jensen counted two, three, four, six cosine-sharp fins that stretched into Devil Bay. ""Hergot,"" Jensen grumbled, ""here are those sharks!"" As soon as such a mowing pool sank, its tail fluttered above the water and it swirled sharply in the water. Captain J. van Toch began to jump furiously on the shore, spewing curses and threatening the sharks with his fists. Then a brief tropical twilight set in, and the moon sailed over the island, and Jensen took the oars and approached the boat with the boat except for one furlong. The captain was now sitting on a boulder doing ts-ts-ts. Something was moving around him, but what, it was indistinguishable. It looks like seals, Jensen thought, but seals climb differently. It emerged from the water between the boulders and swayed along the shore like penguins. Jensen spoke softly and stopped half a furlong from the captain. Yes, the captain says something, but whatever the devil understands, it's probably Malay or Tamil. He spreads his arms as if throwing something at those seals (but they're not seals, Jensen made sure), while chattering in Chinese or Malay. At that moment, a raised oar slipped from Jensen's hand and slapped the water. The captain raised his head, got up, and walked about thirty paces to the water, suddenly it began to flash and crackle, the captain firing from the browning toward the boat. Almost at the same time, it rustled, swirled, clapped in the bay, as if a thousand seals were jumping into the water, but Jensen and Gudmundson were already leaning into the oars, pushing their boat around the corner until it was whistling. When they returned to the ship, they did not say a word to anyone. These Northerners can be silent after all. The captain returned in the morning, grim and angry, but said no word. Only as Jensen helped him aboard did two pairs of blue eyes meet with a cold, searching gaze.","It was from that evening on that Captain J. van Toch's behaviour became so strange. He did not return to the village until dawn; said not a word to anyone but merely had himself taken back to the ship, where he locked himself in his cabin until evening. Nobody thought this very odd as the Kandong Bandoeng had some of the blessings of Tana Masa to load on board (copra, pepper, camphor, guttapercha, palm oil, tobacco and labourers); but that evening, when they went to tell him that everything had been loaded, he just snorted and said, “Boat. To the village.” And he did not return until dawn. Jensen the Swede, who helped him back on board, merely asked him politely whether they would be setting sail that day. The captain turned on him as if he had just been knifed in the back. “And what's it to you?” he snapped. “You mind your own damned business!” All that day the Kandong Bandoeng lay at anchor off the coast of Tana Masa and did nothing. In the evening the captain rolled out of his cabin and ordered, “Boat. To the village.” Zapatis, the little Greek, stared at him with his one blind eye and the other eye squinting. “Look at this lads,” he crowed, “either the old mans got some girl or he's gone totally mad.” Jensen the Swede scowled. “And what's it to you?” he snapped at Zapatis. “You mind your own damned business!” Then, together with Gudmundson the Icelander, he took the little boat and rowed down to Devil Bay. They stayed in the boat behind the rocks and waited to see what would happen. The captain came across the bay and seemed to be waiting for someone; he stopped for a while and called out something like ts-ts-ts. “Look at this,” said Gudmundson, pointing to the sea which now glittered red and gold in the sunset. Jensen counted two, three, four, six fins, as sharp as little scythes, which glided across Devil Bay. “Oh God,” grumbled Jensen, “there are sharks here!” When, shortly afterwards, one of the little scythes submerged, a tail swished out above the water and created a violent eddy. At this, Captain J. van Toch on the shore began to jump up and down in fury, issued a gush of curses and threatened the sharks with his fist. Then the short tropical twilight was over and the light of the moon shone over the island; Jensen took the oars and rowed the boat to within a furlong of the shore. Now the captain was sitting on a rock calling ts-ts-ts. Nearby something moved, but it was not possible to see exactly what. It looks like a seal, thought Jensen, but seals don't move like that. It came out of the water between the rocks and pattered along the beach, swaying from side to side like a penguin. Jensen quietly rowed in and stopped half a furlong away from the captain. Yes, the captain was saying something, but the Devil knew what it was; he must have been speaking in Tamil or Malay. He opened his hands wide as if about to throw something to these seals (although Jensen was now sure they were not seals), and all the time babbling his Chinese or Malay. Just then the raised oar slipped out of Jensen's hand and fell in the water with a splash. The captain lifted his head, got up and walked about thirty paces into the water; there was a sudden flashing and banging; the captain was shooting with his browning in the direction of the boat. Almost simultaneously there was a rustling and a splashing in the bay as, with a whirl of activity, it seemed as if a thousand seals were jumping into the water; but Jensen and Gudmundson were already pressing on the oars and driving the boat so hard that it swished through the water until it was behind the nearest corner. When they got back to the ship they said not a word to anyone. The northern races know how to keep silent. In the morning the captain returned; he was angry and unhappy, but said nothing. Only, when Jensen helped him on board both men gave each other a cold and inquisitive look.","That evening marked the start of Captain J. van Toch’s eccentricity. He did not return to the kampong until daybreak; he spoke not a single word and had himself rowed out to the ship, where he locked himself in his cabin until evening. So far nobody noticed anything out of the ordinary since the Kandong Bandoeng was busy enough loading some of the blessings of the island (copra, pepper, camphor, gutta-percha, palm oil, tobacco and labour); but when in the evening he was informed that all the cargo had been stowed he merely snorted and said: ‘The boat. To the kampong.’ And again he did not return until dawn. The Swede Jensen, who helped him on board, inquired, just from politeness: ‘So we’re sailing today, captain?’ The captain spun round as if he had had a needle stuck in his behind. ‘What the hell’s that to you?’ he snapped. ‘Mind your own bloody business!’ All day long the Kandong Bandoeng rode at anchor a cable’s length off the shore of Tana Masa, doing nothing. As evening fell the captain rolled out of his cabin and commanded: ‘The boat. To the kampong.’ Zapatis, the little Greek, followed him with his one blind and one squinting eye. ‘ Boys,’ he said; ‘either the old man’s got a girl there or he’s gone clean off his rocker.’ The Swede Jensen scowled. ‘What the hell’s that to you?’ he snapped at Zapatis. ‘Mind your own bloody business!’ Then, together with the Icelander Gudmunson he took the little dinghy and rowed in the direction of Devil Bay. They pulled in behind some boulders and awaited developments. In the bay the captain was pacing up and down: he seemed to be waiting for somebody. Now and again he would stop and call out something like ts, ts, ts. ‘ Look,’ Gudmunson said, pointing to the sea which was now blindingly red and golden from the sunset. Jensen counted two, three, four, six fins, sharp as a blade, making for Devil Bay. ‘Shit,’ muttered Jensen; ‘all those sharks!’ Every so often one of the blades would submerge, a tail would flap above the surface and the water would be churned up. At that point Captain J. van Toch began to hop about furiously on the beach, hurl curses and shake his fist at the sharks. Then a brief tropical dusk fell and the moon sailed out over the island. Jensen gripped his oars and brought the dinghy to within a furlong of the shore. The captain was now sitting on a boulder, going ts, ts, ts. Something was moving near him, but it was difficult to make out what it was. Looks like seals, Jensen thought, but seals crawl differently. Whatever it was emerged from the water among the boulders and waddled along the beach with a swaying motion like penguins. Jensen quietly pulled on his oars and stopped half a furlong from the captain. Yes, the captain was saying something, but the devil only knew what it was - probably Malay or Tamil. He was waving his arms as if he were throwing something to the seals (except that they weren’t seals, Jensen reassured himself), and all the while he was jabbering away in Chinese or Malay. At that moment a raised oar slipped from Jensen’s hand and slapped into the water. The captain raised his head, stood up and took about thirty paces towards the water. And suddenly there were flashes and cracks: the captain was firing his Browning in the direction of the dinghy. Almost simultaneously there was a rustling, swirling and splashing as if of a thousand seals diving into the water. But by then Jensen and Gudmundson were pulling on their oars and fairly whipping their dinghy round the nearest headland. When they got back to the ship they did not say a word to anyone. These Nordics know how to keep silent. The captain returned towards dawn: he was morose and angry, but he did not speak a word. Only as Jensen was helping him on board two pairs of blue eyes met in a cold searching stare."

Už pro nás není dost místa na vašich březích. Proto musíme odbourat vaše pevniny. Uděláme z nich samé zálivy a ostrovy. Tím se dá délka světových břehů zpětinásobit. Budeme stavět nové mělčiny. Nemůžeme žít v hlubokém moři. Budeme potřebovat vašich pevnin jako materiálu k zasypání hlubin. Nemáme proti vám nic, ale je nás příliš mnoho. Můžete se zatím odstěhovat do vnitrozemí. Můžete se uchýlit do hor. Hory se budou bourat až na konec.","Hello, you people! Keep calm. We have no hostile intentions against you. We just need more water, more shores, more shoals for our lives.

This can increase the length of the world's shores. We will build new shoals. We can't live in the deep sea. We will need your land as a material to fill the depths.

In this way, the length of coastline can be increased five-fold. We will construct new shallows. We cannot live in deep ocean. We will need your continents as materials to fill in the deep waters.

"Tři dny po zemětřesení v Louisianě byla hlášena nová geologická katastrofa, tentokrát v Číně. Za mohutného, dunivého otřesu země se roztrhlo v provincii Kiangsu mořské pobřeží severně od Nankingu, asi uprostřed mezi ústím Jang-tse a starým korytem Hwang-ho, do této trhliny vniklo moře a spojilo se s velikými jezery Pan-jün a Hung-tsu mezi městy Hwaingan a Fugjang. Zdá se, že následkem zemětřesení opouští Jang-tse pod Nankingem své koryto a valí se směrem k jezeru Tai a dále na Hang-čou. Ztráty na lidských životech nelze zatím ani přibližně odhadnout. Statisíce lidí prchají do severních a jižních provincií. Japonské válečné lodi dostaly rozkaz vyplout k postiženému pobřeží.","Three days after the Louisiana earthquake, a new geological catastrophe was reported, this time in China. In a massive, roaring earthquake, the sea coast in Kiangsu province north of Nanjing, about midway between the Yangtze estuary and the old Hwang-ho riverbed, ripped into the rift and merged with the great Pan-Yun and Hung-tsu lakes between the cities of Hwaingan and Fugjang. As a result of the earthquake, Yangssei under Nanjing appears to be leaving its bed and rolling towards Lake Tai and then to Hangzhou. The loss of human life cannot yet be roughly estimated. Hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing to the northern and southern provinces. Japanese warships were ordered to sail to the affected coast.","Three days after the earthquake in Louisiana there was another geological catastrophe announced, this time in China. The coast of the province of Kiangsu, north of Nanking, about half way between the mouth of the Yangtse and the old bed of the Hwangho, was ripped apart in a powerful, thunderous earthquake; the sea gushed into this fissure and joined up with the great lakes of Pan Yoon and Hungtsu between the cities of Hwaingan and Fugyang. Apparently as a result of the earthquake, the Yangtse left its course below Nanking and flowed down towards Lake Tai and on to Hang-Cho. Loss of human life cannot, so far, even be estimated. Hundred of thousands of refugees are fleeing into the provinces to the north and south. Japanese warships have been given orders to sail to the affected area.","Three days after the Louisiana earthquake a new geological disaster was reported, this time from China.

It seemed that as a result of the earthquake the Yangtse had shifted its river-bed below Nanking, flowing instead towards Lake Tai and on to Hangchow. No estimate, even approximate, could yet be made of the loss of life. Hundreds of thousands were fleeing into the northern and southern provinces.

"Naproti tomu slečna Blanche Kistemaeckers pozorovala v zajetí dvě samice a jednoho samce Andriase Scheuchzeri. V době výtěru se samec přidružil jenom k jedné ze samic a pronásledoval ji dosti brutálně, když mu unikala, bil ji silnými ranami ocasu. Viděl nerad, když přijímala potravu, a zatlačoval ji od pokrmů, bylo patrno, že ji chce mít jenom pro sebe, a prostě ji terorizoval. Když vypustil své mlíčí, vrhl se na druhou samici a chtěl ji sežrat, musel být z nádrže vyňat a umístěn jinde. Přesto i tato druhá samice snesla vajíčka oplodněná v celkovém počtu šedesát tři. U všech tří zvířat však slečna Kistemaeckers pozorovala, že okraje kloaky byly v té době značně naduřelé. Zdá se tedy, píše slečna Kistemaeckers, že se u Andriase oplodnění neděje ani kopulací, ani výtěrem, nýbrž prostřednictvím čehosi, co lze nazvat sexuální milieu. Jak vidět, není třeba ani dočasného sdružení, aby došlo k oplození vajíček. To vedlo mladou badatelku k dalším zajímavým pokusům. Oddělila od sebe obě pohlaví, když pak nadešla vhodná chvíle, vymačkala ze samce chám a dala jej samicím do vody. Nato samice počaly snášet vajíčka oplozená. V dalším pokusu filtrovala slečna Blanche Kistemaeckers samčí chám a filtrát zbavený chámových tělísek (byla to čirá, slabě kyselá kapalina) přidala samicím do vody, samice i nyní jaly se snášet vajíčka, každá asi padesát, z nichž většina byla oplozených a vydala normální pulce. To právě přivedlo slečnu Kistemaeekers k důležitému pojmu pohlavního prostředí, jež tvoří samostatný přechod mezi partenogenezí a rozmnožováním pohlavním. Oplodnění vajíček děje se prostě chemickou změnou prostředí (jistým okyselením, které se dosud nepodařilo sestrojit uměle), změnou, která nějakým způsobem souvisí se samčí pohlavní funkcí. Ale této samotné funkce není vlastně třeba, to, že se samec sdružuje se samicí, je patrně přežitek staršího vývojového stupně, kdy se oplozování u Andriase dálo stejně jako u jiných mloků. To sdružení je vlastně, jak správně podotýká slečna Kistemaeckers, jakási zděděná iluze paternity, ve skutečnosti samec není otcem pulců, nýbrž jenom určitým, v podstatě zcela neosobním chemickým činitelem pohlavního prostředí, jež je vlastním oplozovatelem. Kdybychom měli v jedné nádrži sto sdružených párů Andriase Scheuchzeri, domnívali bychom se, že se tu odehrává sto individuálních rozplozovacích aktů, ve skutečnosti je to akt jediný, a sice kolektivní sexualizace daného prostředí, nebo řečeno přesněji: jisté překyselení vody, na něž zralá vajíčka Andriase automaticky reagují vývojem v pulce. Sestrojte uměle to neznámé kyselé agens, a nebude třeba samců. Tak se nám pohlavní život podivuhodného Andriase jeví jako Veliká Iluze, jeho erotická vášeň, jeho manželství a pohlavní tyranie, jeho dočasná věrnost, jeho těžkopádná a pomalá rozkoš, to vše jsou vlastně zbytečné, přežilé, téměř symbolické úkony, které provázejí nebo tak říkajíc vyzdobují vlastní neosobní samčí akt, jímž jest vytvoření oplozujícího sexuálního prostředí. Zvláštní lhostejnost samic, se kterou přijímají ono bezúčelné, frenetické osobní dvoření samců, svědčí zřetelně o tom, že v těch námluvách samice instinktivně vyciťují pouhý formální obřad nebo úvod k vlastnímu snubnímu aktu, v němž ony pohlavně splývají s oplozujícím prostředím, řekli bychom, že samička Andriase tento stav věcí chápe jasněji a prožívá věcněji, bez erotických iluzí.","Miss Blanche Kistemaeckers, on the other hand, observed two females and one male, Andrias Scheuchzeri, in captivity. At the time of the spawning, the male joined only one of the females and chased her quite brutally when she escaped, beating her with strong tail blows. He didn't like it when she ate and pushed it away from food, it seemed that he only wanted it for himself, and he just terrorized it. When he released his milk, he threw himself at the other female and wanted to eat her, he had to be removed from the tank and placed elsewhere. Nevertheless, even this second female laid eggs fertilized in a total of sixty-three. However, in all three animals, Miss Kistemaeckers observed that the edges of the cloaca were considerably puffy at the time. So it seems, writes Miss Kistemaeckers, that in Andrias fertilization does not take place by copulation or swabbing, but through what can be called a sexual milieu. As you can see, there is no need for a temporary association to fertilize the eggs. This led the young researcher to another interesting experiment. She separated the two sexes when the time came, she squeezed the cham out of the male and put it in the water of the females. Then the females began to lay fertilized eggs. In another experiment, Miss Blanche Kistemaeckers filtered male cham and added a chameless filtrate (it was a clear, weakly acidic liquid) to the females, and the females still lay eggs, about fifty each, most of whom were fertilized and released normal tadpoles. This has just led to Miss Kistemaeekers on the important notion of the sexual environment, which forms a separate transition between parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction. Fertilization of eggs occurs simply by a chemical change in the environment (a certain acidification that has not yet been artificially constructed), a change that is in some way related to the male's sexual function. But this function itself is not really necessary, the fact that the male associates with the female is probably a remnant of an older developmental stage, when fertilization in Andrias took place in the same way as in other salamanders. This association is, in fact, as Miss Kistemaeckers rightly points out, a kind of inherited illusion of paternity; If we had one hundred Andrias Scheuchzeri couples in one tank, we would assume that there were a hundred individual acts of procreation, in fact it is the only act, namely the collective sexualization of the environment, or more precisely: a certain over-acidification of the water to which the mature eggs mature. Andrias react automatically with developments in the tadpole. Artificially construct this unknown acidic agent, and there will be no need for males. Thus the sexual life of the wonderful Andrias appears to us as the Great Illusion, his erotic passion, his marriage and sexual tyranny, his temporary fidelity, his cumbersome and slow pleasure, these are all actually useless, surviving, almost symbolic acts that accompany or, so to speak, decorate own impersonal male act, which is the creation of a fertilizing sexual environment. The special indifference of females with which they accept the purposeless, frantic personal courtship of males clearly shows that in those courtships females instinctively feel a mere formal ceremony or introduction to their own marriage act, in which they sexually merge with the fertilizing environment, we would say that female Andrias understands this state of affairs more clearly and experiences it more objectively, without erotic illusions.","The behaviour observed by Miss Blanche Kistemaeckers of two newts in captivity was somewhat different. At the time of spawning the male approached only one female and pursued her quite brutally; when she escaped from him he beat her with heavy blows of his tail. He disapproved when she tried to take food and drove her away from it; it was clear he wanted to have her just for himself and simply terrorised her. Once he had discharged his milt he threw himself on another female and tried to eat her, so that he had to be taken from the tank and placed somewhere else. This second female nonetheless produced fertile eggs, numbering sixty-three in total. Miss Kistemaeckers noticed that the cloaca of all three animals was very sore, and she writes that fertilisation of the ova of Andrias Scheuchzeri seems to take place not by copulation, nor even spawning, but by what she called the sexual milieu. It is already evident that the two sexes need not come together at an appropriate time for fertilisation of the eggs to take place. This led the young researcher to carry out further experiments. She separated the two sexes; at the appropriate time she extracted the sperm from the male and put it into the water where the females were, at which the females began to discharge fertilised eggs. In another experiment Miss Kistemaeckers filtered the semen to remove the sperm; this gave a clear, slightly acidic liquid which she put into the females water; the females then began to discharge eggs, about fifty at a time, of which most were fertile and produced normal tadpoles. This is what led Miss Kistemaeckers to the important notion of the sexual milieu, which can be seen as a process in its own right, existing between parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction. The eggs are fertilised simply by a change in the chemical environment (a certain level of acidity, which has not so far been successfully created artificially), which is somehow connected with the sexual functions of the male although these functions themselves are not essential; the fact that the male does conjoin with the female is clearly no more than a vestige of an earlier stage of evolution when Andrias reproduced in the same way as other newts. Miss Kistemaeckers rightly observes that this form of mating is peculiar, some kind of inherited illusion of paternity; the male is not the real father of the tadpoles but only an impersonal provider of the chemical environment which is what really fertilises the ova. If we had a hundred newt couples together in a tank it would be tempting to think that a hundred individual acts of mating would take place; but in fact there will be just the one, a collective a sexualisation of the given environment or, to put it more precisely, the acidification of the water to which the mature eggs of the species will respond by developing into tadpoles. If this unknown acidification agent can be created artificially there will be no more need of males. So the sex life of this remarkable species is actually no more than an illusion; the erotic passion, the pair-bonding and sexual tyranny, fidelity for the time needed, the slow and cumbersome act of intercourse, all these things are actually unnecessary and no more than an outdated and almost symbolic act which, so to speak, decorates the impersonal creation by the male of the procreative environment. The strange indifference shown by the female to the frantic and pointless activity of the male is clear evidence that she instinctively feels that it is nothing more than a formal ceremony or a prelude to the real love-making when they conjoin with the fertilising medium; it could almost be said that the female of Andrias Scheuchzeri understands this state of affairs clearly and goes through it objectively without any erotic illusions.","Miss Blanche Kistemaeckers, on the other hand, observed two females and one male Andrias Scheuchzeri in captivity. At mating time the male associated with only one of the females, pursuing her fairly brutally; whenever she eluded him he struck her viciously with his tail. He did not like to see her feed and tried to push her away from her food; it was obvious that he wanted to have her only for himself, and downright terrorised her. When he had emitted his semen he threw himself on the other female and tried to devour her; he had to be removed from his tank and accommodated elsewhere. Nevertheless, that second female also laid fertilised eggs, amounting to a total of sixty-three. However, Miss Kistemaeckers observed that in all three animals the rims of their cloacae were considerably swollen at that time. It would seem therefore, Miss Kistemaeckers writes, that in the case of Andrias fertilisation is accomplished neither by copulation nor externally, but by means of something that might be termed the sexual milieu. As has been seen, fertilisation of the eggs does not require even temporary association. This led the investigator to further interesting experiments. She separated the two sexes; when the appropriate moment arrived she squeezed out the sperm from the male and placed it in the water with the females. Thereupon the females began to lay fertilised eggs. In a further experiment Miss Blanche Kistemaeckers filtered the male’s semen and introduced the filtrate from which the spermatozoa had been removed (a clear slightly acid fluid) into the water with the females; even then the females began to lay eggs, about fifty in number, of which the majority were fertilised and yielded normal tadpoles. This led Miss Kistemaeckers to the important concept of the sexual milieu, which represents a separate intermediate stage between parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction. Fertilisation of the eggs takes place simply through a chemical change of the environment (a certain increase in acidity which it has not so far been possible to bring about artificially), a change which seems to be connected somehow with the sexual function of the male. But evidently that function is not itself necessary; the fact that the male associates with the female appears to be a survival of an earlier developmental stage, when fertilisation in the case of Andrias took place in the same way as in other Newts. That association, as Miss Kistemaeckers rightly points out, is some kind of inherited illusion of paternity; in fact the male is not the father of the tadpoles but merely a certain - essentially impersonal - chemical factor of the sexual milieu which is the real fertilising agent. If we kept a hundred associated pairs of Andrias Scheuchzeri in one tank we might assume that a hundred individual fertilisation acts are taking place; in actual fact this is one single act, namely the collective sexualisation of the given environment, or, to put it more precisely, a certain increase in the acidity of the water, to which the ripe eggs of Andrias automatically react by developing into tadpoles. Produce that unknown acidity factor artificially, and no males will be necessary. Thus the sex life of the remarkable Andrias is revealed as a Grand Illusion; his erotic passion, his marriage and sexual tyranny, his temporary fidelity, his ponderous and slow ecstasy - all these are really unnecessary, outdated , almost symbolical actions accompanying or, in a manner of speaking, adorning the male’s true impersonal sexual act which is the creation of the sexual milieu permitting fertilisation. The females’ strange apathy with which they react to that pointless frantic personal courtship of the males clearly suggests that in the males’ wooing the females instinctively see a purely formal ceremony or a prelude to their own mating act, in which they coalesce sexually with the fertilising environment; we might say that the Andrias female has a clearer idea of the state of affairs and a more down-to-earth approach to it, free from erotic illusions."

V noci o jedné hodině skřehotal v rozhlase rozčilený hlas: ""Hallo, hallo, hallo, Chief Salamander speaking! Hallo, Chief Salamander is going to speak!"" A tu se ozval unavený, chraptivý, rozhněvaný hlas: ""Hallo, vy lidé! Hallo, vy lidé! Hallo, vy lidé! Myslíte, že se necháme vyhladovět? Nechte vašich hloupostí! Cokoliv, co děláte, se obrátí proti vám! Jménem všech Mloků světa volám Velkou Británii. Vyhlašujeme od této hodiny neomezenou blokádu britských ostrovů kromě Svobodného státu irského. Uzavírám Lamanšský kanál. Uzavírám Suezský průplav. Uzavírám úžinu Gibraltarskou pro všechny lodě. Všechny britské přístavy jsou uzavřeny. Všechny britské lodě v kterémkoli moři budou torpédovány. Hallo, volám Německo. Zvyšuju objednávku třaskavin desetkrát. Dodávejte ihned loco hlavní depot Skagerrak. Hallo, volám Francii. Dodejte urychleně objednaná torpéda do podmořských fortů C3, BFF a Quest 5. Hallo, vy lidé! Varuju vás. Omezíte-li nám dodávky potravin, vezmu si je sám z vašich lodí. Varuju vás znovu."" Unavený hlas klesal až v chrčivý, stěží srozumitelný chrapot. ""Hallo, volám Itálii. Připravte se na evakuaci území Benátky - Padova - Udine. Varuju vás naposled, lidi. Už je dost vašich nesmyslů."" Nastala dlouhá pauza, ve které to šumělo jako černé a studené moře. A tu opět spustil veselý a kvákavý hlas: ""A teď vám zahrajeme z vašich gramofonových desek poslední úspěch Triton-Trot""","The following afternoon, ships Winnipeg, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec were sunk southwest of Mizen Head. A wave of horror swept through the world. In the evening, the BBC announced that His Majesty's government had banned the Newts from supplying any food, chemical products, tools, weapons and metals. At one o'clock in the night, an angry voice creaked on the radio: ""Hello, hello, hello, Chief Salamander speaking! Hello, Chief Salamander is going to speak!"" And then a tired, hoarse, angry voice said, ""Hello, you people! Hello, you people! Hello, you people! Do you think we will starve? Leave your stupidity! Whatever you do will turn against you!

And here again a cheerful and quacking voice started: ""And now we will play the last success of Triton-Trot from your records""","The following afternoon the Manitoba, Winnipeg, Ontario and Quebec were sunk south-west of Mizen Head. The world was overcome with a wave of horror.

At one o'clock that night an excited voice rasped out from the radio: “Hello, hello, hello, Chief Salamander speaking!

You people have been warned, and warned for the last time. Any more nonsense from you will not be tolerated.” There was a long pause while nothing was heard but the hissing of the radio like a cold, black sea.

"Vedle dobře organizovaného obchodu s Mloky a rozsáhlé tiskové propagandy měla největší zásluhu o rozšíření Mloků obrovská vlna technického idealismu, která v tomto období zaplavila celý svět. H. G. Bondy správně předvídal, že lidský duch počne nyní pracovat s celými novými kontinenty a novými Atlantidami. Po celý Mločí Věk panoval mezi techniky živý a plodný spor, mají-li se stavět těžké pevniny s železobetonovými břehy, nebo lehké souše nasypané z mořského písku. Skoro denně se vynořovaly nové gigantické projekty: italští inženýři navrhovali jednak vybudování Velké Itálie, zaujímající téměř celé Středozemní moře až po Tripolsko, Baleáry a Dodekanes, jednak založení nové pevniny, takřečené Lemurie, na východ od Italského Somálska, která by jednou zabrala celý Indický oceán. Skutečně také byl za pomoci celé armády Mloků nasypán nový ostrůvek proti somálskému přístavu Mogadišu v rozloze třinácti a půl akrů. Japonsko projektovalo a zčásti provedlo nový veliký ostrov místo dřívějšího souostroví Marian a připravovalo spojení Karolín a Maršálských ostrovů ve dva veliké ostrovy, předem nazvané Nový Nippon, na každém se měla dokonce zřídit umělá sopka, která by budoucím obyvatelům připomínala posvátnou Fudžijamu. Proslýchalo se také, že němečtí inženýři budují tajně v Sargasovém moři těžkou, betonovou pevninu, která má být budoucí Atlantidou a mohla by prý ohrožovat Francouzskou západní Afriku, ale jak se zdá, došlo jenom k položení základů. V Holandsku se přikročilo k vysušování Zeelandu, Francie spojila na Guadeloupu Grande Terre, Basse Terre a La Désirade v jediný požehnaný ostrov, Spojené státy začaly budovat na 37. poledníku první letecký ostrov (dvoupatrový, s obrovským hotelem, sportovním stadiónem, lunaparkem a biografem pro pět tisíc osob.) Prostě zdálo se, že nyní padly poslední meze, jež lidskému rozmachu kladlo světové moře, nastala radostná epocha úžasných technických plánů, člověk si uvědomoval, že teprve nyní se stává Pánem Světa, dík Mlokům, kteří vystoupili na dějiště světa v pravou chvíli a tak říkajíc s dějinnou nutností. Není sporu, že by nebylo došlo k tomu nesmírnému rozšíření Mloků, kdyby pro ně náš technický věk nebyl připravil tolik pracovních úkolů a tak obrovské pole trvalého zaměstnání. Budoucnost Dělníků Moře se zdála být nyní zajištěna na staletí.","In addition to the well-organized Newt trade and extensive press propaganda, the huge wave of technical idealism that flooded the world during this period had the greatest credit for spreading Newts. H. Bondy rightly foresaw that the human spirit would now begin to work with all new continents and new Atlantis. Throughout Newt Age, there was a lively and fruitful dispute between technicians over the construction of heavy lands with reinforced concrete shores, or light lands sprinkled with sea sand. Almost daily, new gigantic projects emerged: Italian engineers proposed building Great Italy, covering almost the entire Mediterranean to Tripoli, the Balearic Islands and the Dodecanese, and establishing a new mainland, the so-called Lemuria, east of Italian Somalia, which would one day occupy the entire Indian Ocean. . Indeed, with the help of an entire army of Newts, a new island was poured against the Somali port of Mogadishu in an area of thirteen and a half acres. Japan designed and partially implemented a new large island in place of the former Marian archipelago, preparing the union of the Carolinas and the Marshal Islands into two large islands, previously called New Nippon, each with an artificial volcano to remind future residents of the sacred Fujiyama. It has also been rumored that German engineers are secretly building a heavy, concrete mainland in the Sargasso Sea, which is supposed to be the future Atlantis and could allegedly threaten French West Africa, but it seems that only the foundations have been laid. In the Netherlands, Zeeland began to be drained, France united the Grande Terre, Basse Terre and La Désirade on Guadeloupe into a single blessed island. five thousand people.) It just seemed that the last limits of the world's seas had now fallen, a joyful era of wonderful technical plans, and that he realized that only now he became Lord of the World, thanks to the Newts who had ascended the world in right moment and so to speak with historical necessity. There is no doubt that there would not have been an immense expansion of Newts if our technical age had not prepared so many job tasks for them and such a huge field of permanent employment. The future of the Sea Workers now seemed to be secured for centuries.","Trading in newts was well organised, and there was an extensive advertising campaign in the press, but the biggest influence in the expansion of the newt population was the enormous wave of technological idealism which inundated the entire world at that time. G.H. Bondy rightly foresaw that from then on the human spirit would be working with whole new continents and new Atlantisses. The whole of the Newt Age was dominated by a lively and fertile dispute among the technically minded as to whether firm land should be constructed with shores of reinforced concrete or merely light land laid down as deposits of marine sand. New and gigantic projects appeared almost every day: there were some Italian engineers who suggested the construction of a Great Italy taking in most of the Mediterranean Sea as far as Tripoli, the Balearic Islands and the Dodecanese, and others who wanted to establish a new continent to be called 'Lemuria' to the east of Italian Somalia which would take in the entire Indian Ocean in one move. With the help of armies of newts, new islands covering thirteen and a half acres were indeed laid down near the Somalian port of Mogadishu. Japan planned and partly realised a new great island to cover the former Marian Archipelago and made preparations to combine the Caroline and Marshall Islands into two big islands, provisionally named 'New Nippon'; each of the two islands was to be created by means of an artificial volcano which would remind their prospective inhabitants of the famous Mount Fuji. It was also rumoured that German engineers were secretly building a durable, concrete landmass in the Sargasso Sea which was to be the new Atlantis and, it was said, would be a threat to French East Africa; but it seems that this went no further than laying the foundations. In Holland, Zeeland was reclaimed; France combined Guadeloupe, Grande Terre, Basse Terre and La DÃ©sirade into one big island; the United States began to build the first airfield-island on the 37th. meridian (two storeys high with an enormous hotel, sport stadium, funfair and a cinema for five thousand people). It simply seemed that the last limits imposed on human expansion imposed by the sea had now fallen; a new and radiant age of amazing technical plans began; man realised that now, at last, he was becoming the Lord of the World, and that was thanks to the newts who had stepped onto the world stage at the right moment and, as it were, with the force of history. There is no doubt that the newts would never have burgeoned the way they did if our own technical age had not prepared so many jobs for them and so many places of long-term employment. The future of the Workers of the Sea now seemed to be guaranteed for centuries to come.","Alongside a well-organised Newt market and extensive press publicity, the major factor in the spread of the Newts was a huge wave of technological idealism which then flooded the whole world. G. H. Bondy had correctly predicted that the human intellect would start to operate in terms of entire new continents and new Atlantises. Throughout the Newt Age a lively and fruitful argument reigned among the technologists: should heavy continents be built with reinforced concrete coasts or lightweight continents of piled up sea sand? Almost daily giant new projects hit the headlines: Italian engineers were proposing, on the one hand, the construction of a Greater Italy which would take up virtually the entire Mediterranean all the way to Tripolitania, the Balearic Islands and the Dodecanese and, on the other, the establishment of a new continent, to be known as Lemuria, to the east of Italian Somaliland which would, one day, take up the whole of the Indian Ocean. In point of fact, with the aid of a whole army of Newts, a new little island was piled up opposite the Somalian port of Mogadishu, measuring thirteen and half acres. Japan had projected, and indeed partly completed, a big new island in place of the former Mariana group and was planning to link the Carolinas and Marshall Islands into two large islands, named in advance New Nippon; in fact each of these was to have an artificial volcano installed, to remind future inhabitants of the sacred Mount Fuji. There were rumours that German engineers were secretely developing a heavy concrete continent in the Sargasso Sea, to be the Atlantis of the future and capable of threatening French West Africa; but it seemed that no more than is foundations were completed. In Holland, steps were taken to drain Zeeland dry; France, on Guadeloupe, was linking up Grande Terre, Basse Terre and La Desirade into one blessed isle; and the United States had begun to construct the first aircraft island on the 37th meridian (two storeys, with a gigantic hotel, a sports stadium, a Fun Park and a cinema seating five thousand). In short, it seemed that the last barriers had fallen which the world’s oceans had erected to human progress; it was the dawn of a joyous new age of amazing technical projects; man was beginning to realise that only now was he truly becoming the Master of the World, thanks to the Newts who had appeared on the world stage at the right moment and, in a manner of speaking, out of historical necessity. There can be no doubt that the immense proliferation of the Newts would not have come about if our age of technology had not provided for them such a wealth of tasks and such a vast field of permanent employment. The future of the Workers of the Sea seemed to be secure for centuries."

"Naproti tomu, pokračoval na slovo vzatý učenec poněkud konejšivě, není třeba brát vážně obavy, že by se v postižené končině projevila sopečná činnost, domnělé krátery chrlící bahno nejsou nic jiného než erupce bahenních plynů, k nimž asi došlo na trhlině vermillionské. Nebylo by divu, kdyby se v náplavu mississippském vyskytovaly ohromné podzemní bubliny plynů, které při styku se vzduchem mohou explodovat a zvedat s sebou statisíce tun vody a bahna. Ovšem k definitivnímu vysvětlení, opakoval dr. W. R. Brownell, bude třeba dalších zkušeností.","On the other hand, the scholar continued, somewhat reassuringly, there is no need to take seriously fears that volcanic activity will occur in the affected area; No wonder there were huge underground gas bubbles in the Mississippi alluvium that could explode in contact with the air, lifting hundreds of thousands of tons of water and mud. However, for a definitive explanation, Dr. repeated. W. R. Brownell, more experience will be needed.","On the other hand, the scientist continued more reassuringly, we need not take seriously any fear of volcanic activity in the affected areas; these craters hurling mud into the air are nothing more than eruptions of natural gas which must have been under the Vermilion fault. It wouldn't be at all surprising to find gigantic caverns of gas underneath the Mississippi Delta area, and these caverns of natural gas can explode when they come into contact with the air, hurling hundreds of thousands of tons of water and mud into the air as they do so. But of course, before we can come to any definitive conclusions, Dr. W.R. Brownell repeated, we will need to obtain more data.","Nevertheless, the eminent scientist continued reassuringly, there was no reason to take seriously any fears of imminent volcanic activity in the affected area; the supposed craters ejecting mud were nothing but eruptions of swamp gases associated with the Vermilion fissure. It would not be surprising if huge underground gas bubbles existed in the Mississippi alluvium: these might explode on contact with the air and throw up hundreds of tons of water and mud. Naturally, Dr W. R. Brownell repeated, a definitive explanation would have to await further developments."

"Den poté sdělila britská vláda na dotaz v parlamentě: že vojensky bylo vykonáno vše na obranu britského pobřeží, že nejsou vyloučeny další a daleko rozsáhlejší útoky na britskou půdu, že však vláda Jeho Veličenstva nemůže vyjednávat s nepřítelem, který nešetří civilních obyvatel ani žen. (Souhlas.) Dnes už nejde o osud Anglie, nýbrž o celý civilizovaný svět. Velká Británie je ochotna uvažovat o mezinárodních zárukách, které by omezily tyto strašlivé a barbarské útoky ohrožující samo lidstvo.","The day after, the British government said in response to parliament: that everything had been done militarily to defend the British coast, that further and far-reaching attacks on British soil were not ruled out, but that His Majesty's government could not negotiate with an enemy that spared no civilian population or women. (Agree.) Today, it is no longer about the fate of England, but about the whole civilized world. Britain is willing to consider international safeguards to curb these horrific and barbaric attacks threatening humanity itself.","The following day the British government answered questions in parliament: all military measures for the protection of British coasts had been taken; the possibility of further and much more extensive attacks on British soil could not be excluded; that His Majesty's Government was nonetheless unable to negotiate with an enemy which was unwilling even to spare civilians and women. (Agreement) This was a time that would not merely determine the fate of England, but of the entire civilised world. The United Kingdom would be willing to enter into international agreements which would limit these terrible and barbaric attacks which threaten the future of mankind itself.","The next day the British government, in reply to a Commons question, stated that, from a military point of view, everything possible had been done to protect the British coast; however, further and much more extensive attacks on British territory could not be ruled out. Nevertheless, His Majesty’s Government could not negotiate with an enemy who waged war on civilians and women. (Hear, hear.) What was at stake was no longer the fate of Britain but that of the whole civilised world. Britain was ready to consider international guarantees to limit these terrible and barbarian attacks, which represented a menace to mankind itself."
"Jedna z oblíbených činností lidského ducha je představovat si, jak jednou v daleké budoucnosti bude vypadat svět a člověčenstvo, jaké technické zázraky budou vykonány, jaké sociální otázky vyřešeny, jak daleko pokročí věda a společenská organizace a tak dále. Většina těch utopií však nezapomíná velmi živě se zajímat o otázku, jak to v tom lepším, pokročilejším nebo aspoň technicky dokonalejším světě dopadne s institucí tak starou, ale stále populární, jako je pohlavní život, rozplozování, láska, manželství, rodina, ženská otázka a podobně. Viz v tom směru příslušnou literaturu, jako Paul Adam, H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley a mnozí jiní.","One of the popular activities of the human spirit is to imagine what the world and humanity will look like in the distant future, what technical miracles will be performed, what social issues will be solved, how far science and social organization will progress, and so on. However, most of these utopias do not forget to take a very keen interest in the question of how it will end up in an better, more advanced or at least technically more perfect world with an institution as old but still popular as sex life, procreation, love, marriage, family, women's issue and similarly. See relevant literature in this regard, such as Paul Adam, H. G.

But however much improved, progressed or at least more technically perfect these utopias are, they never fail to take a lively interest in the question of how one of the most ancient of institutions might be. Sex, reproduction, love, marriage, family, the status of women and so on are as popular now as they have always been. Consider, in this respect, the works of Paul Adam, HG. Wells, Aldous Huxley and many others.","One of the favourite occupations of the human mind is to speculate how the world and mankind will look in the distant future, what technological miracles will have been accomplished, what social problems solved, and what progress made by science and social organisation, and so on.

"Je ovšem těžko si představit, pokračoval X v dalších paragrafech, co by si mohli nebo chtěli Mloci na lidech vzít. Nemohou žít na souši, a my jim celkem nemůžeme překážet v tom, jak si žijí pod vodou. Naše a jejich životní prostředí je od sebe přesně a navěky odděleno. Je sice pravda, že na nich žádáme určité pracovní výkony, ale za to je z velké části krmíme a dodáváme jim suroviny a tovary, kterých by bez nás vůbec neměli, například kovy. Ale i když není praktického důvodu k nějakému antagonismu mezi námi a Mloky, je tu, řekl bych, protiva metafyzická: proti tvorům povrchovým stojí tvorové hlubinní (abyssal), bytosti noční proti bytostem denním, temné tůně vodní proti jasné a suché zemi. Hranice mezi vodou a zemí je nějak ostřejší, nežli bývala: naší země se dotýká jejich voda. Mohli bychom žít pro všechny časy dokonale mimo sebe a vyměňovat si jenom určité služby a produkty, ale je těžko se zbavit tísnivého pocitu, že to asi nepůjde. Proč? Nemohu vám podat přesných důvodů, ale ten pocit tu je, je to cosi jako tušení, že jednou se vodstvo samo obrátí proti zemi, aby se vyřídila otázka kdo s koho.","However, it is difficult to imagine, X continued in other paragraphs, what Newts could or wanted to take on humans. They can't live on land, and we can't stop them from living underwater at all. Ours and their environment are precisely and forever separated from each other. It is true that we demand certain work on them, but for that we largely feed them and supply them with raw materials and goods that they would not have without us, such as metals. But while there is no practical reason for any antagonism between us and the Newts, there is, I would say, a metaphysical adversary: against the surface creatures, there are deep creatures (abyssal), nocturnal beings against the day beings, dark pools of water against the clear and dry land. The border between water and land is somehow sharper than it used to be: our land is touched by their water. We could live perfectly apart for all time and exchange only certain services and products, but it is difficult to get rid of the distressing feeling that this will probably not work. Why? I can't give you the exact reasons, but the feeling is there, it's kind of a hunch that one day the community will turn against the ground to deal with the question of who and with whom.","It is obviously very difficult to imagine , X continued in the following paragraphs, what the newts might want of people, or how much they could simply take. They cannot live on dry land and there is no way for us to dictate to them what they do under the water. Our respective living environments are completely and unchangeably separate. We require a certain amount of work from them, but in return we give them plenty of food and provide them with raw materials and products such as metals that, without us, they would not have at all. But even if there is no practical reason for any animosity between ourselves and the newts there is, I would say, metaphysical reason: contrasted with creatures of the surface we see creatures of the deep abyss; creatures of the night with creatures of the day; dark ponds of water with bright, dry land. The boundary between water and land has somehow become sharper than it used to be: our land borders on their water. We could live perfectly well separate from each other, exchanging no more than certain goods and services, indefinitely; but it is hard to rid ourselves of the fear that that is not how things will turn out. And why not? I am not able to give you any precise reasons; but this fear is nonetheless with us; it seems like some kind of intuition that one day the sea itself will turn against the land to settle the question of who lives with whom.","It is, of course, difficult to imagine, X continued in subsequent paragraphs, what the Newts could or might wish to take from man. They cannot live on dry land, and we cannot on the whole prevent them from living the way they want under water. Their habitat and ours are precisely and permanently separated from each other. It is true, no doubt, that we require certain labour performances from them, but then we very largely feed them and supply them with raw materials and commodities which but for us they would not have at all, such as metals. But even though there are no practical grounds for any antagonism between us and the Newts, there exists, I would suggest, a metaphysical revulsion: surface creatures are confronted by creatures of the deep (abyssal creatures); creatures of the night are opposing the creatures of day; the dark watery pools against the bright dry earth. The demarcation line between water and land is somehow sharper than it used to be: our land is lapped by their water. We could survive perfectly well and forever in separate spheres, merely exchanging certain services and products -yet it is difficult to avoid the uneasy feeling that this is probably impossible. Why? I cannot give you definite reasons, but the feeling is there; it is something like a premonition that one day the watery world itself will turn against the dry land to settle the question of who rules whom."

"Ještě téže noci se konala s mločí delegací první porada. Na pořadu byla otázka, jak by se dal co nejrychleji obnovit mír mezi Mloky a Velkou Británií. K slovu se přihlásil profesor van Dott. Není sporu, řekl, že Mloci byli od Velké Británie napadeni, britská dělová loď Erebus přepadla na širém moři vysílací loď Mloků, britská admiralita porušila pokojný obchodní styk s Mloky tím, že zabránila lodi Amenhotep vylodit objednaný náklad třaskavin, do třetice pak britská vláda svým zákazem jakýchkoli dodávek zahájila blokádu Salamandrů. Mloci si nemohli na tyto nepřátelské skutky stěžovat ani v Haagu, ježto Londýnská konvence nedala Mlokům právo žaloby, ani v Ženevě, protože nejsou členy Společnosti národů, nezbylo jim tedy než sáhnout k sebeobraně. Přesto je Chief Salamander ochoten zastavit válečné akce, ovšem za těchto podmínek: 1. Velká Británie se Mlokům omluví za výše uvedená příkoří, 2. odvolá všechny zákazy dodávek Mlokům, 3. jako odškodnění postoupí Salamandrům bez náhrady nížinná úvodí v Paňdžábu, aby si tam mohli zřídit nové břehy a mořské zátoky. - Nato předseda konference ohlásil, že podá o těchto podmínkách zprávu svému váženému příteli zástupci Velké Británie, který je právě nepřítomen, netajil se však s obavou, že tyto podmínky budou stěží přijatelné, nicméně lze doufat, že v nich můžeme spatřovat východisko k dalšímu jednání.","The first meeting of the salamander delegation took place the same night. On the agenda was the question of how peace could be restored between Newts and Great Britain as soon as possible. Professor van Dott spoke. There is no dispute, he said that the Newts had been attacked by Great Britain, the British gunboat Erebus attacked the Newts' broadcast ship on the high seas, the British Admiralty violated peaceful trade with the Newts by preventing the Amenhotep from landing the ordered cargo of explosives, and the British government by banning any supplies, it launched a blockade of the Salamanders. Newts could not complain about these hostile acts in The Hague, as the London Convention did not give Newts the right to sue, nor in Geneva, because they are not members of the League of Nations, so they had no choice but to resort to self-defense. Nevertheless, Chief Salamander is willing to stop the war, but under the following conditions: 1. Great Britain apologizes to the Newts for the above-mentioned hardships, 2. lifts all bans on supplies to the Newts, 3. as compensation, cedes to the Salamanders without compensation they could establish new shores and sea bays. - The chairman of the conference then announced that he would report on these conditions to his esteemed friend, who was currently absent, but did not hide his fear that the conditions would hardly be acceptable, but it was to be hoped that we could see them as a way forward. .","The first discussions with the newts' delegates took place that same night, addressing the question of how to renew peace with the United Kingdom as soon as possible. Professor van Dott asserted that there was no question that the newts had come under attack from Great Britain; the British gunboat, Erebus, had fired on the newts radio ship on the open sea; the British admiralty had broken peaceful trading with the newts by preventing the Amenhotep from unloading the cargo of explosives they had ordered; thirdly, the British government had instigated a blockade against the newts by its ban on their receiving any supplies of any sort. The newts were unable to make a complaint about these hostile acts either at The Hague, because the London Convention denied them the right to make any complaint, or in Geneva, because the newts were not a member of the United Nations; they were therefore left with no alternative but to defend themselves. Chief Salamander was nonetheless willing to end hostilities under, of course, the following conditions: 1. The United Kingdom was to apologise for the offences cited above; 2. All restrictions on supplies to the newts were to be lifted; 3. As compensation, the newts were to be ceded the lowland areas of the Punjab where they would create new bays and shorelines. The chairman of the conference stated that he would pass these conditions on to his honourable friend, the representative of the United Kingdom, who was currently unable to attend; however he made no secret of his fear that Britain would find these conditions difficult to accept; but we could all hope that they might be the starting point for further negotiations.","That very night the first meeting was held with the Newt delegation. On the agenda was the question of how peace could most speedily be restored between the Newts and Great Britain. Professor Van Dott requested permission to speak. It was incontestable, he said, that the Newts had been attacked by Great Britain: the British gunboat Erebus had attacked the Newts’ transmitter boat on the open sea; the British Admiralty had violated business relations with the Newts by preventing the ship Amenhotep from unloading a cargo of explosives which had been ordered; thirdly, by its embargo on all deliveries the British government had initiated a blockade of the salamanders. The Newts had not been able to complain about these hostile actions either at the Hague, since the London Convention did not grant to the Newts the right to lodge complaints, or in Geneva, since they were not members of the League of Nations. Hence they had no alternative but to resort to self-defence. Nevertheless, the Chief Salamander was willing to suspend all hostilities, but only on these conditions: (1) Great Britain will apologise to the Newts for the above-mentioned wrongs; (2) she will revoke all bans on deliveries to the Newts; (3) as reparation she will cede to the salamanders, without compensation, the low-lying river lands of the Punjab, where the Newts could establish new coasts and marine bays. - The chairman of the conference thereupon announced that he would report these conditions to his esteemed colleague, the representative of Great Britain, who happened to be absent at that moment; he could not, however, disguise his fear that these terms would scarcely be found acceptable. Nevertheless, it seemed reasonable to hope that they could be seen as a basis for further discussions."

Koneckonců si to už začínáme uvědomovat, odtud ty pokusy a plány sjednotit lidskou společnost jinak, tím, že se radikálně udělá místo jen pro jeden národ, jednu třídu nebo jednu víru. Ale kdo může říci, jak hluboko jsme už infikováni nevyhojitelnou chorobou diferenciace? Dříve nebo později se každý domněle homogenní celek nevyhnutelně opět rozpadne v nesourodý shluk různých zájmů, stran, stavů a tak dále, které se bud budou potírat, nebo budou opět trpět svým soužitím.

"Lidé proti Mlokům! Je načase, aby to už jednou bylo takto formulováno. Vždyť, upřímně řečeno, normální člověk instinktivně Salamandry nenávidí, štítí se jich - a bojí se jich. Na celé člověčenstvo padá cosi jako mrazivý stín hrůzy. Co jiného je ta frenetická požívačnost, ta neúkojná žízeň po zábavě a rozkoši, to orgiastické rozpoutání, které se zmocnilo dnešních lidí? Nebylo podobného úpadku mravů od dob, kdy se na Římskou říši užuž sesouval vpád barbarů. To není jen ovoce nebývalého hmotného blahobytu, nýbrž zoufale přehlušovaná úzkost z rozvratu a zániku. Sem s poslední číší, než bude s námi konec! Jaká hanba, jaké třeštění! Zdá se, že Bůh z hrozného milosrdenství nechává zchátrat národy a třídy, které se řítí v záhubu. Chcete číst ohnivé mene tekel napsané nad hodokvasem lidstva? Pohleďte na světelné nápisy, které po celé noci září na zdech hýřících a prostopášných měst! V tom ohledu se my lidé už přibližujeme Mlokům: že žijeme víc v noci než ve dne.","People against the Newts! It is time for this to be formulated once. After all, to be honest, a normal person instinctively hates Salamanders, shields them - and fears them. Something like a chilling shadow of terror falls on all of humanity. What else is the frenetic pleasure, the insatiable thirst for fun and pleasure, the orgiastic unleashing that has seized today's people? There has been no similar decline in morals since the barbarian invasion of the Roman Empire. This is not only the fruit of unprecedented material prosperity, but the desperately drowning anxiety of disruption and extinction. Here with the last goblet before it's over! What a shame, what a crack! Out of terrible mercy, God seems to be destroying the nations and classes that are rushing to perdition. Do you want to read the fiery names tekel written over the feast of mankind? Take a look at the light signs that shine on the walls of spoiling and raunchy cities all night long! In this respect, we humans are already getting closer to the Newts: that we live more at night than during the day.","People against newts! The time has come when it needs to be formulated thus. It must be said frankly that the normal person has an instinctive hatred of the salamanders, he loathes them—and he is afraid of them. There is something like a chill veil of horror that has fallen over the whole of mankind. How else are we to explain this frenetic worldliness, this insatiable thirst for fun and debauchery, this orgiastic abandon that has taken control of peoples minds? There has never been a comparable collapse of morals since the time when the Roman Empire collapsed under the onslaught of the barbarians. This is more than the fruit of unprecedented material prosperity, it is the desperation born of suppressed fear and anguish at the thought of our own overturn and annihilation. Drink deep the last goblet, for tomorrow we die! What a disgrace, what a punishment! It seems that God, in His terrible mercy, wishes to allow nations and classes to perish if once they have begun to rush down the road to destruction. Are we to read mene tekel in fiery letters at the feast of mankind? Look at the words written in light shining all through the hours of darkness on the walls of our debauched and dissolute cities! In this way we human beings are already comparable with the newts: we live more by night than by day.","Men against the Newts! It is high time the issue was put this way. After all, to be perfectly honest, a normal person instinctively hates the salamanders, he is nauseated by them - and afraid of them.

What else is that frenetic indulgence, that insatiable thirst for amusement and pleasure, that orgiastic licence that has seized present-day humanity? There has not been such moral decadence since the days when barbarian invasion was about to fall upon the Roman Empire. This is not just the fruit of unprecedented material prosperity but a desperate drowning of the voice of fear of disintegration and annihilation. One last cup before we meet our end! What shame, what delirium! It seems that God in his awful mercy ig allowing nations and classes first to deteriorate as they rush to their ruin. Do you wish to read the fiery Mene-tekel written up above mankind’s great feast? Just look at the luminous inscriptions which throughout the night shine on the walls of our dissolute and profligate cities! In that respect we humans are already approaching the Newts: we live more by night than by day."

"Otázka mločí výchovy se nyní počala rozvíjet rychle a normální cestou. Proti vzorným Écoles Zimmermann zvedli pokrokovější učitelé množství závažných námitek, zejména se tvrdilo, že na výchovu mločího dorostu se nehodí zastaralé humanistické školství pro mládež lidskou, rozhodně se zavrhovala výuka v literatuře a dějinách a doporučovalo se, aby co nejvíce místa a času bylo věnováno praktickým a moderním předmětům, jako přírodním vědám, práci ve školních dílnách, technickému výcviku Mloků, tělovýchově a tak dále. Tato takzvaná Reformní Škola čili Škola pro Praktický Život byla opět vášnivě potírána stoupenci klasického vzdělání, kteří hlásali, že Mloky lze přiblížit kulturním statkům lidským jenom na základech latinských a že nestačí naučit je mluvit, nenaučíme-li je citovat básníky a řečnit s výmluvností ciceronskou. Byl z toho dlouhý a dosti rozhořčený spor, který byl nakonec rozřešen tím, že školy pro Salamandry byly postátněny a školy pro lidskou mládež reformovány tak, aby se co nejvíc přiblížily ideálům Reformní Školy pro Mloky.","The issue of salamander education has now begun to develop rapidly and in the normal way. More advanced teachers raised a number of serious objections to the exemplary Écoles Zimmermann, arguing in particular that outdated humanistic education for human youth is not suitable for the education of newts, teaching in literature and history was strongly rejected, and it was recommended that as much space and time as possible be devoted to practical training. and modern subjects, such as science, workshop work, Newt technical training, physical education, and so on. This so-called Reform School, or School for Practical Life, was again passionately struggled by followers of classical education, who proclaimed that Newts could be brought closer to human cultural goods only on Latin bases and that it was not enough to teach them to speak if we did not learn to quote poets and speak with Chicory eloquence. This was a long and quite outraged dispute, which was eventually resolved by the fact that the Salamander schools were nationalized and the schools for human youth reformed to bring them as close as possible to the ideals of the Newt Reform School.","The matter of newt education now began to develop quickly and along its normal path. Exemplary though the Ãcoles Zimmermann were, the most progressive teachers raised a number of serious objections to them; in particular they insisted that the established humanistic schooling for young humans was not suitable for young newts; they certainly recommended the teaching of literature and history but they also recommended that as much time and facilities as possible should be devoted to modern practical subjects such as the natural sciences, craftwork, technical understanding, physical education and so on. These Reform Schools, or Schools for Practical Life, as they were known were, in their turn, passionately opposed by those who supported a classical education and declared that newts could only come to approach the lofty cultural level of human beings on the basis of Latin, and that there was no point in teaching them to speak if they weren't also taught to recite poetry and perform oratory with the eloquence of Cicero. There was a long and rather heated debate which was finally settled when the schools for salamanders were taken over by the state and schools for human children were reformed so that they came as close as possible to the ideals of the Reform Schools for newts.","The issue of Newt education now began to develop rapidly and along predictable lines. Those teachers who were more progressive raised a number of serious objections to the exemplary Écoles Zimmermann: it was argued in particular that the outdated classical grammar school education for human pupils was inappropriate for young Newts. Teaching of literature and history was emphatically rejected and it was recommended instead that the greatest possible scope and time should be devoted to practical and modern subjects, such as the natural sciences, workshop practice, the technological training of the Newts, physical education, and so on. This so-called Reformed School was in turn passionately attacked by the adherents of classical learning: they argued that the only way to bring the Newts closer to human cultural values was through a grounding in Latin, and that it was not enough merely to teach them to speak unless they were also taught to recite poetry and declaim with Ciceronian eloquence. It was a long and rather heated dispute, and it was eventually solved by the salamander schools being taken over by the state and the schools for young humans being reformed with a view to bringing them as near as possible in line with the Reformed School for Newts."

"V první chvíli se mluvilo o výbuchu nějakých min v Kanále, ale když na obou stranách Calaiské úžiny byly břehy uzavřeny řetězem vojska a když anglický premiér počtvrté v dějinách světa přerušil v sobotu večer svůj víkend a vrátil se kvapně do Londýna, počalo se tušit, že jde o událost krajně vážného významu mezinárodního. Noviny přinášely nejpoplašnější pověsti, ale kupodivu zůstávaly tentokrát ještě daleko za skutečností, nikdo ani netušil, že po několik kritických dnů stála Evropa a s ní celý svět na krok od válečné konflagrace. Teprve když po několika letech člen tehdejšího britského kabinetu sir Thomas Mulberry propadl ve volbách do parlamentu a následkem toho vydal své politické paměti, bylo možno se dočíst, co se tehdy vlastně dálo, ale v té době už to vlastně nikoho nezajímalo.","At first there was talk of an explosion of some mines in the Channel, but when the banks of the Strait of Calais were closed by a chain of troops and the English Prime Minister interrupted his weekend for the fourth time in world history and returned hastily to London, it was suspected that it is an event of extremely serious international significance. The newspapers brought the scariest rumors, but strangely they remained far behind the reality this time, and no one knew that for several critical days, Europe and with it the whole world had been one step away from war conflagration. It wasn't until a few years later that Sir Thomas Mulberry, a member of the then British cabinet, had fallen in the parliamentary elections and released his political memories as a result that it was possible to read what was actually possible at the time, but at that time no one really cared.","At first it was thought that a mine in the channel must have exploded; but once the shores on both sides of the Straits of Dover had been ringed off with a chain of soldiers and the English prime-minister had, for the fourth time in the history of the world, interrupted his Saturday evening and hurried back to London, there were those who thought the incident must be of extremely serious international importance. The papers carried some highly alarming rumours, but, oddly enough, this time remained far from the truth; nobody had any idea that Europe, and the whole world with it, stood for a few days on the brink of a major war. It was only several years later that a member of the then British cabinet, Sir Thomas Mulberry, failed to be re-elected in a general election and published his memoirs setting out just what had actually happened; but by then, though, nobody was interested.","At first it was thought that some mines had blown up in the Channel. But when the coasts on both sides of the Straits were cordoned off by troops, and when the British Prime Minister (for only the fourth time in world history) cut short his weekend on Saturday evening to hurry back to London people began to suspect that this was an affair of extremely serious international import. The newspapers carried the most sensational stories, but strangely enough for once they fell far short of the facts: no one even suspected that for a few critical days Europe, and with her the whole world, was hovering on the brink of a warlike conflagration. It was only some years later, when Sir Thomas Mulberry, a member of the British Cabinet at the time, lost his parliamentary seat at the general election and thereupon published his political memoirs that the public was able to find out what had actually happened.

"Tato výstraha brilantního francouzského publicisty vzbudila v Anglii ohromné vzrušení, přes všechna dementi slyšeli lidé v nejrůznějších částech Anglie podzemní skřípění mločích vrtaček. Německé úřední kruhy ovšem řízně odmítly a vyvrátily citovaný článek, prohlašujíce jej od začátku do konce za pusté štvaní a nepřátelskou propagandu, současně však se konaly na Baltu veliké kombinované manévry německého loďstva, pozemních sil a válečných Salamandrů. Při těchto manévrech vyhodily minérské čety Mloků před zraky zahraničních vojenských přidělenců do povětří kus podvrtaných písečných dun poblíž Rügenwalde v rozsahu šesti čtverečních kilometrů. Byla prý to velkolepá podívaná, když se s hrozným duněním nadzvedla země ""jako zpřelámaná kra"" a teprve potom se rozletěla v obrovskou stěnu dýmu, písku a balvanů, udělala se tma skoro jako v noci a zvednutý písek padal v okruhu téměř sta kilometrů, ba snesl se po několika dnech jako písečný déšť až ve Varšavě. V zemském ovzduší zůstalo po této nádherné explozi tolik volně poletujícího drobného písku a prachu, že až do konce toho roku byly západy slunce v celé Evropě neobyčejně krásné, krvavě rudé a ohnivé jako nikdy předtím.","This warning of the brilliant French publicist aroused great excitement in England, despite all the denials, people in various parts of England heard the underground squeak of salamander drills. However, German officials vehemently rejected and refuted the article, declaring it to be harassing and hostile propaganda from start to finish, but at the same time large combined maneuvers of the German fleet, ground forces and war Salamanders took place in the Baltic. During these maneuvers, the salamander platoon of Newts blew up six square miles of rickety sand dunes near Rügenwalde in front of foreign military personnel. It was said to be a magnificent spectacle when the earth rose with a terrible roar ""like a broken kra"" and only then did it fly into a huge wall of smoke, sand and boulders, darkness almost like night and raised sand fell within a radius of almost a hundred kilometers, even after a few days it descended like a sandy rain in Warsaw. After this wonderful explosion, so much free-flowing fine sand and dust remained in the Earth's atmosphere that until the end of that year, sunsets all over Europe were extraordinarily beautiful, blood red and fiery than ever before.","The Marquis de Sade was a brilliant publicist, and his warning caused great consternation in England; despite all the denials, people in every part of England were able to hear the newts drilling into the ground beneath their feet. Officials in Germany, of course, issued a categorical denial and repudiated the Marquis' speech, declaring that from start to finish it was no more than provocation and hostile propaganda; at the same time, however, combined manoeuvres were taking place in the Baltic involving the German navy, land forces and warrior newts; squads of sapper newts, in full view of foreign military attachÃ©s, under-drilled and blew up six square kilometres of sand dunes near RÃ¼genwald. It was said to be a wonderful spectacle when, with a terrifying roar, the ground rose up and an enormous wall of steam, sand and tree trunks flew skywards; it became as dark as night, and the sand that had been thrown up was scattered over a radius of nearly fifty kilometres, even as far away as Warsaw there was still a sandy rain falling several days later. This enormous explosion left so much fine sand and dust suspended in the atmosphere that all through the rest of that year the sunsets throughout Europe were exceptionally beautiful, coloured a bloody red, and fiery like never before.","This warning by the brilliant French commentator caused tremendous excitement in England. In spite of all denials people in the most diverse parts of England heard the crunch of the Newts’ drills underground. German official quarters, of course, emphatically repudiated and refuted the article quoted, describing it as sheer incitement and enemy propaganda from start to finish; simultaneously, however, major combined exercises were taking place in the Baltic between the German Navy, land forces and combat salamanders. As part of these exercises a Newt sapper platoon, before the eyes of foreign military attaches, blew up a strip of undermined sand dunes near Riigenwalde, an area of six square kilometres. It was said to have been a magnificent spectacle when, with a dreadful rumbling, the earth rose up ‘like a cracked ice-floe’, to break up a moment later into a gigantic wall of smoke, sand and boulders. The sky grew dark, almost as though it were night, and the raised sand fell over a radius of nearly a hundred kilometres, indeed after a few days it fell as a sandy rain as far away as Warsaw. After that magnificent explosion so much freely suspended fine sand and dust remained in the earth’s atmosphere that throughout Europe the sunsets were exceptionally beautiful right to the end of the year - blood-red and fiery as never before."

Do you know who lends the Newts money, do you know who finances this End of the World, this whole new Flood?","No, that's too cheap and easy. Why should nature have to put right what's been done by man? See?—not even you think they could do anything to save themselves now. You basically think something will come along from somewhere else. I'll tell you something: do you know who it is that still—even now when a fifth of Europe is already underwater—is still providing the newts with explosives and torpedoes and drills? Do you know who it is that's working feverishly in all the laboratories, trying to find even more effective machines and materials for sweeping the world out of existence? Do you know who it is who's lending the newts money, who it is who's financing the end of the world, this new Flood?","‘Too facile, old chap. Why should Nature put right what man has messed up? There you are, even you don’t believe any longer that men will help themselves. In the end you’d like to rely on mankind being saved by someone or something! Let me ask you this; do you know who even now, with one-fifth of Europe inundated, is supplying the Newts with high explosives and torpedoes and drills? Do you know who is feverishly working in laboratories night and day to discover even more efficient machines and substances to blow up the world? Do you know who is lending money to the Newts, who is financing this End of the World, this whole new Flood?’"

"Pokud známo, poněkud většího rozšíření došel u Mloků monismus, někteří Mloci věřili také v materialismus, zlatý standard a jiné vědecké věrouky. Jeden populární filozof, jménem Georg Sequenz, sestavil dokonce zvláštní náboženskou nauku pro Mloky, jejímž hlavním a nejvyšším článkem byla víra ve Velkého Salamandra. Tato víra se sice u Mloků vůbec neujala, ale zato našla hojně přívrženců u lidí, zejména ve velkých městech, kde vznikla skoro přes noc spousta tajných templů pro salamandří kult. Mloci sami v pozdějších dobách téměř obecně přijali jinou víru, o které ani není známo, kde se mezi nimi vzala, bylo to uctívání Molocha, kterého si představovali jako obrovského Mloka s lidskou hlavou, měli prý ohromné podmořské modly z litiny, které si dali dělat u Armstronga nebo u Kruppa, ale bližší podrobnosti o jejich kultických obřadech, prý neobyčejně krutých a tajných, nevyšly nikdy najevo, protože se konaly pod vodou. Zdá se, že tato víra se u nich rozšířila proto, že jméno Moloch jim připomínalo přírodovědecký (Molche) nebo německý (Molch) název pro Mloka.","As far as is known, there has been a somewhat greater spread among Newts monism, some Newts also believed in materialism, the gold standard, and other scientific beliefs. One popular philosopher, Georg Sequenz, even compiled a special religious doctrine for Newts, whose main and highest article was the belief in the Great Salamander. Although this belief did not take hold among the Newts, it found a large number of adherents among the people, especially in large cities, where many secret temples for the salamander cult were created almost overnight. Newts themselves in later times almost generally adopted a different faith, of which it is not even known where it came from, it was the worship of Moloch, whom they imagined as a huge Newt with a human head, they said they had great underwater idols made of cast iron, which they could do at Armstrong or Krupp, but more details about their cult ceremonies, said to be extraordinarily cruel and secret, were never revealed because they took place underwater. This belief seems to have spread to them because the name Moloch reminded them of the scientific (Molche) or German (Molch) name for Newt.","As far as is known, monism was spread quite widely among the newts, with some of the newts believing in materialism and some of them in the gold standard or some other scientific doctrine. One popular philosopher called Georg Sequenz even compiled a special set of religious teachings for the newts centred around a belief in something called the Great Salamander. This system of faith met with no success whatsoever among the newts but found many converts among human beings, especially in the major cities where almost overnight a large number of secret temples for the salamander cult appeared. 24 Most of the newts themselves, somewhat later on, adopted a different faith, although it is not known how they came to it; this was the worship of Moloch, whom they imagined as an enormous newt with a human head; it was said they had gigantic metal idols of this god under the water which they had had made by Armstrong or Krupp. However, no more details about this cult or its rituals were ever learned—despite their reputation for exceptional cruelty and secrecy—because they took place under water. It seems that this faith spread among them because the name 'Moloch' reminded them of the Latin and German words for newts ('Molche').","As far as is known, monism achieved a somewhat greater following among the Newts; some of them also believed in materialism, the gold standard and other scientific doctrines. One popular philosopher, George Sequenz by name, even developed a special religious teaching for Newts, its central and highest article of faith being belief in the Great Salamander. Admittedly, this faith gained no adherents among the Newts at all, but it had quite a following among humans, especially in the big cities, where a huge number of secret temples of the salamander cult sprang up virtually overnight.19 At a later period and almost universally the Newts themselves came to accept a different faith, whose origin among them is unknown; this involved adoration of Moloch, whom they visualised as a giant Newt with a human head; they were reported to have enormous submarine idols made of cast iron, manufactured to their orders by Armstrong or Krupp, but no further details ever leaked out of their cultic rituals since they were conducted under water; they were, however, believed to be exceptionally cruel and secret. It would seem that this faith gained ground rapidly because the name Moloch reminded them of the zoological molche or the German Molch, the terms for Newt."
"Na ty projevy odpověděl skvělý francouzský publicista markýz de Sade, zpravidla výtečně informovaný, v tomto smyslu: Britský lord admirality prohlásil, že Velká Británie je připravena na všechny eventuality. Dobrá, je však vznešenému lordu známo, že Německo má ve svých baltských Mlocích stálou a strašlivě vyzbrojenou armádu, čítající dnes pět miliónů kombatantních Salamandrů z povolání, kterou může ihned nasadit do války ve vodě i na břehu? K tomu připočtěte nějakých sedmnáct miliónů Mloků pro službu technickou a etapní, připravených kdykoliv nastoupit jako rezervní a okupační armáda. Dnes je baltský Salamandr nejlepší voják na světě, psychologicky dokonale zpracován, vidí ve válce své pravé a nejvyšší poslání, půjde do každého boje s nadšením fanatika, s chladným důmyslem technika a s příšernou kázní právě pruského Mloka.","The speeches were answered by the great French publicist Marquis de Sade, usually well-informed, in this sense: The British Lord of the Admiralty declared that Great Britain was ready for any eventuality. Well, is the noble lord aware that Germany has a stable and terribly armed army in its Baltic Newts, now numbering five million combatant Salamanders by profession, which it can immediately deploy to war in water and on shore? To this must be added some seventeen million Newts for technical and stage service, ready to join as a reserve and occupying army at any time. Today, the Baltic Salamander is the best soldier in the world, psychologically perfectly processed, he sees his true and highest mission in war, he will go into every fight with the enthusiasm of a fanatic, with the cold ingenuity of technology and with the terrible discipline of the Prussian Newt.","The outstanding French publicist, the Marquis de Sade, who was always well informed, responded to this speech in this way: The British first lord of the admiralty declares that Great Britain is ready for any eventuality. That is all well and good, but is the noble lord aware that Germany has a standing army of heavily armed newts in the Baltic, currently comprising five million professional salamander soldiers, who are ready to engage in military action at any time on land or sea? On top of that must be considered the seventeen million newts engaged in technical and supportive functions who act as a reserve and are ready, at any time, to become an army of occupation? The Baltic salamander is presently the greatest soldier in the world; trained to the perfect mentality, it sees war is its proper vocation and the most noble; it enters every battle with the enthusiasm of a fanatic, with cool technical planning and the awful discipline of Prussia.","A reply to these statements came from the brilliant French journalist, the Marquis de Sade, a man usually extremely well informed. Britain’s First Lord of the Admiralty (he said) had declared Great Britain to be prepared for all eventualities. Very good. But is the noble lord aware that Germany has in her Baltic Newts a permanent and very well-equipped army already numbering 5 million regular combat Newts who can be employed at a moment’s notice in the sea or on shore? Add to them some 17 million Newts in the technical and supply services, ready to operate at any time as a reserve or an army of occupation. Today the Baltic Newt is the best soldier in the world; psychologically perfectly brain-washed, he sees his true and supreme mission in war; he will go into any battle with the enthusiasm of the fanatic, with the cool reasoning of the technician and with the terrifying discipline of a true Prussian Newt."

"""Tímto mezinárodním aktem,"" napsal v Le Temps M. Jules Sauerstoff, ""je zajištěna budoucnost Mloků a pokojný vývoj lidstva na dlouhé desítky let. Blahopřejeme londýnské konferenci k zdárnému ukončení jejích obtížných porad, blahopřejeme také Mlokům k tomu, že daným statutem se jim dostává ochrany haagského soudu, nyní se mohou s klidem a důvěrou věnovat své práci a svému podmořskému pokroku. Budiž zdůrazněno, že odpolitizování Mločího Problému, které došlo výrazu v Londýnské konvenci, je jednou z nejdůležitějších záruk světového míru, zejména odzbrojení Salamandrů zmenšuje pravděpodobnost podmořských konfliktů mezi jednotlivými státy. Fakt je, že - i když trvají tak četné hraniční i mocenské rozpory na všech skoro kontinentech - nehrozí světovému míru žádné aktuální nebezpečí aspoň ze strany mořské. Ale i na suché zemi se zdá být nyní mír lépe zajištěn, než býval kdy jindy, námořní státy jsou plně zaměstnány budováním nových břehů a mohou rozšiřovat svá území do světového moře, místo aby se snažily posunout své hranice na souši. Už nebude nutno bojovat železem a plynem o každou píď půdy, stačí prosté motyky a lopaty Mloků, aby si každý stát postavil tolik teritoria, kolik potřebuje, a tuto pokojnou mločí práci pro mír a blahobyt všech národů zaručuje právě Londýnská konvence. Ještě nikdy nebyl svět tak blízek trvalému míru a pokojnému sice, ale slavnému rozkvětu jako právě nyní. Místo Mločího Problému, o kterém se toho už tolik namluvilo a napsalo, bude se nyní snad právem mluvit o Zlatém Mločím Věku.""","""This international act,"" wrote Jules Sauerstoff in Le Temps, ""secures the future of Newts and the peaceful development of humanity for many decades. It is emphasized that the depoliticisation of the Newt Problem, as expressed in the London Convention, is one of the most important guarantees of world peace, in particular the disarmament of the Salamanders reduces the likelihood of submarine conflicts. The fact is that, despite so many border and power disputes on almost every continent, there is no current danger to world peace, at least from the sea, but even on a dry land, peace now seems better secured than ever before. at other times, maritime states are fully engaged in building new shores and can expand their territories into the world sea, instead of ab y tried to push their borders on land. It will no longer be necessary to fight with iron and gas for every inch of land, simple hoes and shovels of Newts are enough for each state to build as much territory as it needs, and this peaceful salamander work for the peace and well-being of all nations is guaranteed by the London Convention. Never before has the world been as close to lasting peace and peaceful but glorious prosperity as it is now. Instead of the Newt Problem, of which so much has been talked about and written about, there will now be a right to talk about the Golden Newt Age. ""","“By this international action,” wrote Monsieur Jules Sauerstoff in 'Le Temps', “the future of the newts is assured, along with peaceful development for people for many decades to come. We congratulate the London conference for its successful conclusions on some difficult questions; and we also congratulate the newts that by this statute they come under the protection of the court at The Hague; they will henceforth be able to devote themselves to their work and their underwater progress with a sense of peace and trust. It should be emphasised that the removal of the Newt Problem from the field of politics, which is what the London conference has achieved, is one of the most important assurances we have of world peace; the disarming of the salamanders, in particular, will do a great deal to reduce the likelihood of underwater conflicts between individual states. The fact is that—even though many border disputes and power struggles continue between states on almost every continent—there is no current threat to world peace, at least not from the direction of the sea. But on dry land, too, we seem to have a better assurance of peace than ever before; the seafaring nations are fully occupied with the construction of new shores and will be able to increase their territory by reclaiming land from the sea instead of trying to extend their frontiers on dry land. There will no longer be any need to fight with iron and gas for every tiny piece of land; all that is needed will be the picks and shovels wielded by the newts for every state to build as much territory as it needs; and it is the London Convention which ensures that the peaceful labour of the newts will bring peace and prosperity for all the nations of the world. The world has never before been so close to a lasting peace and a quiet but glorious efflorescence than now. Instead of the Newt Problem about which so much has been written and said, we will now have good reason to talk of The Golden Age of the Newt'.” * * * NOTES [1. Cf. G.

The War with the Newts, book I, chapter 12.] [3. This can be seen straight away from the first cutting in Mr. Povondra's collection: NEWT MARKET (Czechoslovak Press Agency) Reports issued by the Salamander Syndicate for the end of the quarter show a thirty percent rise in newt trading. Nearly seventy million newts were supplied over this period, especially to south and central America, Indochina and Italian Somalia. Plans are in progress for deepening and widening the Panama Canal, dredging Guayaquil harbour and the deepening of shallow waters in the Torres Straits, which, according to the latest estimates will involve moving nine thousand million cubic metres of firm land. Construction of islands for major airports between Madeira and Bermuda is not due to start until next spring. Creation of the Marian Islands, under Japanese authority, is still in progress; eight hundred and forty acres of new land—light land as it is called—has been created so far between the islands of Tinian and Saipan. Newt prices are very strong, due the increasing demand, at Leading 61 and Team 620. Supplies are adequate.] [4. Difficulties of this sort are illustrated in this undated cutting:] [5. Almost the only pistol used for this purpose was the one invented by InÅ¾. Mirko Å afrÃ¡nek and manufactured in the city of Brno.] [6. Cf. the following newpaper report” (Havas) The Australian trade union leader, Harry MacNamara, declared a general strike for all workers in the shipping, transport, electronics and related trades because of the belief by members of these trades that the import of working newts into Australia should come under strict control in accordance with immigration laws. In contrast, Australian farmers have been agitating to have restrictions on the import of newts eased because demand for domestically grown maize and animal fats, especially sheep fat, has substantially increased in order to feed them. The government wants to have a compromise; the Newt Syndicate offers to make a payment of six shillings to the trades unions for each newt imported and the government is willing to guarantee that the newts will be employed only in the water, which, for reasons of public decency, they will remain immersed in up to the chest. The trade unions, though, insist the newts show no more than their heads and ask for a payment of ten shillings per newt in accordance with registration taxes. It seems most likely that an agreement will be reached that involves contributions from the public purse.] [7. Cf. a remarkable document from Mr. Povondra's collection: 36 DROWNING PEOPLE SAVED BY NEWTS (From our own correspondent) Madras, 3rd April The steamer, Indian Star, collided with a boat carrying around 40 natives in Madras harbour, putting them all in danger of drowning. Before a police boat could be sent out, a number of newts working on the removal of mud from the dock area rushed to their assistance and carried thirty-six drowning people back to dry land. One of the salamanders was seen personally to pull three women and two children from the water. As a reward for their noble actions the local authorities wrote them a letter of thanks which was presented to them in a waterproof case. On the other hand, many of the local residents were appalled at the newts having been allowed to touch drowning people who belonged to a higher caste. This was because the newts are regarded as unclean and therefore as untouchable. Several thousand natives gathered at the dockside insisting that the newts be removed from the harbour area. Police however succeeded in maintaining order; there were three deaths and one hundred and twenty arrests. Peace was restored by ten o'clock in the evening and the salamanders have returned to work.] [8.

Cf. the following extensive and objective description, signed as e.w., 5th October: S-TRADE “Singapore, 4th October. Leading 63. Heavy 317. Team 648. Odd Jobs 26.35. Trash 0.08. Spawn 80—132.” Readers can find reports of this sort every day in the financial sections of the papers between reports on the price of cotton, tin or wheat. But do you know what is meant by these mysterious words and figures? Yes, they refer to the trade in salamanders, or S-Trade; but most readers idea of what these figures actually mean is less precise. Perhaps they imagine a big market place swarming with thousands and thousands of newts, where buyers come in their sun helmets and turbans, inspect the goods on offer and finally point to a healthy, well developed, young newt saying, “I'd like to buy this piece, what is its cost?” In reality, the newt market looks somewhat different. In the marble-clad S-Trade building in Singapore you will not see a single newt, only lively and elegant officials in white suits taking telephone orders. “Yes sir. Leading cost 63. How many? Two hundred? That will be alright. Twenty Heavy and a hundred and eighty Team. Okay, that's quite clear. The ship sets sail in five weeks time. Right? Thank you, sir.” The whole of the S-Trade palace is abuzz with telephone calls; it seems more like an office or a bank than a market; but this white and grand-looking building with the Ionian columns at the front is a market place more famous than the Harun ar Rashid bazaar in Baghdad. But let us return to the market report mentioned above with all its commercial jargon. Leading means simply the specially selected, most intelligent newts, usually about three years old and carefully trained to become supervisors and managers in the newts work colonies. They are sold individually and without regard to their body weight; they are valued solely for their intelligence. Singapore Leading, all of whom speak good English, are considered best of all and the most reliable; there are also various other kinds of newts given positions of responsibility, such as the Capitanos, Engineers, Malayan Chiefs, Foremanders and so on, but it is the Leading Newts that are thought the most valuable. Their present value is about sixty dollars. The Heavies are muscular newts, usually about two years old and weighing between a hundred and a hundred and twenty pounds. They are sold only in squads known as bodies, consisting of six individuals each. They have been trained to perform the heaviest physical work such as rock breaking, removing boulders and so on. If a report states that Heavies are at 317, that means that the cost if each body is $317. Each squad of Heavies is usually assigned to one Leading which will act as supervisor. Team are the ordinary working newts, weighing between 80 and 100 pounds each; they are sold only in working groups (teams) of twenty; they are intended for use together on major tasks and are often used for dredging, construction of dykes and dams and so on. Each team of twenty will have a Leading to supervise it. The Odd Jobs constitute a class of their own. These are newts that, for one reason or another, were never trained for collective or specialised work. This could be because they grew up outside the large specialist newt farms run by specialists. They are, in fact, half wild, but can often be very talented. They can be bought individually or by the dozen and can be used for various kinds of supplementary or minor jobs for which a whole squad of newts would not be needed. If the Leadings can be seen as the Ã©lite of the newt world, the Odd Jobs can be seen as something like the proletariat. Recently, they have commonly been bought as the raw material for newts which can be trained further into Leading, Heavy, Team or Trash. The Trash are the less valuable newts which are weak or physically defective. They are not sold as individuals or in squads but in bulk by weight, typically several dozen tons at a time; the price of a kilogram of live weight is currently between seven and ten cents. It is not actually known what they are used for or why they are bought— maybe they are put to some kind of light work in water; to avoid misunderstanding, you should remember that newts are not edible for man. They are bought almost exclusively by Chinese middle-men; where they take them has never been ascertained. Spawn consists of tadpoles up the age of twelve months. They are bought and sold by hundreds and enjoy a lively trade, mainly because they are cheap to buy and cheap to transport; they grow into adult newts, capable of work, at the place where they are to be employed. The Spawn are transported in barrels, as although adult newts need to leave the water every day the tadpoles never do. It is not unusual for individuals of exceptional talent to emerge from among the Spawn, even more capable than the typical Leading; this adds a peculiar interest to dealing in tadpoles. These highly talented newts can then be sold for several hundred dollars each; the American millionaire, Denicker, paid as much as two thousand dollars for a newt that spoke nine languages fluently and had it transported on a special ship all the way to Miami; the transport alone cost nearly twenty thousand dollars. It has recently become popular to buy tadpoles for the newt stables, where fast sporting newts are selected and trained; they are then harnessed in groups of three onto flat boats in the form of a shell. These shell races of boats pulled by newts are now the height of fashion and the favourite pastime of young American girls in Palm Beach, Honolulu and Cuba; they are known as Triton Races or Venus Regattas. The young women competing will stand in the light shell-shaped boat and scud across the water dressed in the shortest and most alluring swimsuits, controlling the team of three newts through silken reins; the prize is merely the title, Venus. Mr. J.S Tincker, known as the tin-can king, bought a trio of racing newts for his little daughter, Poseidon, Hengist and King Edward, for at least thirty-six thousand dollars. But all this is not part of the S-Trade proper, which limits itself to the provision, round the world, of reliable, working Leadings, Heavies and Teams. We have already mentioned the newt farms. The reader ought not to imagine fields and enormous breeding pens; the farms consist of no more than a few miles of bare coastline with a few scatted huts of corrugated iron. One hut is for the vet, one for the manager, and the others are for the supervising personnel. It is only when the tide goes out that it is possible to see the long fences running out into the sea and dividing the beach into a number of basins. One is for the tadpoles, the second for the Leading class, and so on; each class is fed and exercised separately but always at night. At sunset, the newts come out of their holes in the shore and gather around their teachers, who are ordinary old soldiers. First comes the talking lesson; the teacher will say a word such as dig out loud to the newts, and mime its meaning. Then they form into ranks of four and they are taught to march; this is followed by a half hour of physical exercises and a period of rest in the water. After the break, they are how to handle various tools and weapons and then, under the supervision of their teachers, they do practical work on underwater constructions for about three hours. After this work they go back into the water where they are fed on dried food for newts, consisting mainly of corn flour and fat; Leadings and Heavies are also given meat. Laziness and disobedience are punished by withholding food, there are no other physical punishments, mainly because salamanders have virtually no sense of pain. As soon as the Sun rises on the newt farms there is a deathly silence; the humans go to bed and the newts disappear under the sea. There are only two times in the year when this procedure is not followed. Once in the mating season when the newts are left to their own devices for two weeks, and secondly when the tanker from the Newt Syndicate steams into the farm with orders to the farmer about how many newts of what classes are to be taken away. This takes place at night; the ships captain, the farm manager and a vet sit at a table under the lamplight while the supervisors and ships ratings close off the newts access to the sea. Then the newts come one at a time to the table to be judged whether they are suitable or not. The newts chosen are put into the dinghy and taken on board the tanker. Mostly, they are quite willing to collaborate in this affair, with little more ever needed than a sharp word of command; there are rare occasions when mild force is needed in form of handcuffs. The tadpoles, of course, are caught in nets. Once on board the newt tankers, the salamanders are transported under conditions just as humane and hygienic; they receive highly nutritious food and the water in their tanks is changed every day. The death rate on the voyage hardly reaches ten percent. At the request of animal protection societies, every newt tanker has a chaplain on board who watches over how the crew behave towards the newts and is required to preach to them every night that they should always show respect for humans, always do as they are told and always feel love for their prospective employers, who would never show anything but fatherly concern for their well-being. Fatherly concern must certainly be a difficult concept to explain to newts, as fatherhood is something unknown to them. The better educated salamanders adopted the name Papa Newt for the ships chaplains. The newts were also shown educational films during the voyage which displayed not only the wonders of human technology but also what work and duties would be expected of the newts. These films were found to be very effective. There are those who say that S-Trade stands for Slave Trade. Well, as disinterested observers we can say that if the former slave trade had been as well organised and hygienic and as perfectly operated as the current trade in newts, then we could only offer the slaves our congratulations. The more expensive salamanders in particular are treated very well, if only because the captain and crew of the newt tankers are depend on the lives of the newts entrusted to them for their own wages. The author of this article has seen personally how the toughest of seamen on tanker SS 14 were deeply touched when two hundred and forty top class newts in one of the tanks became ill and suffered serious diarrhoea. They went to see them almost with tears in their eyes and gave expression to their humane feelings with the rough words, “These bastards owe us too much to die on us now!”] [10. We cite the following contemporary description: BUCCANEERS OF THE XX CENTURY E.E.K. It was eleven at night when the captain ordered the national flag to be taken down and put out the dinghy. It was a bright, moonlit night; I think it was Gardner Island we rowed out to, in the Phoenix Archipelago. On moonlit nights like that the newts come out onto the shore and dance; you can go up close to them and they won't hear you, they're so obsessed with this dance of theirs, all there together and saying nothing. There were twenty of us who went onshore carrying oars, we spread out all around the swarm of newts on the beach and surrounded them in the darkness, apart from the milky light of the moon. It's hard to describe what it feels like to see those newts dancing. About three hundred of them sit on their back legs in a perfect circle, facing inwards; the middle of the circle is empty. The newts keep perfectly still as if they'd gone rigid; it looks like a circular palisade around some secret altar; only there's no altar there and no god. All of a sudden one of them starts hissing “ts-ts-ts” and swinging the upper half of its body round and round; then the next one starts doing the same and so on and on and after a few seconds all the newts are whirling the upper half of their bodies round like a frenzy, but staying on the same spot, quicker and quicker, not saying a word but getting faster and faster, like they were drunk or possessed. After about a quarter of an hour one of the newts will start to get tired, then another, then a third, they'll lose their strength as they swing round and then go stiff; then they all sit still again like statues, then after a while another one of them will start going “ts-ts-ts"", another one will start swinging round and then they're all suddenly dancing again, the whole circle. I know the way I'm describing it makes it sound very mechanical, but imagine it with the moonlight making everything white and the waves on the shore make their long slow sounds; there was something made it seem infinitely magical, and something made it seem evil. I stood there, hardly breathing, I wasn't sure whether I was amazed or horrified. “Here, you'd better move your feet, mate,” called the man nearest to me, “else you'll start growing roots!” We closed in around the circle of animals as they danced. The men held their oars out in front of them and whispered, not so much because the newts might hear them as that it was night. “Into the middle, quick,” called out the commanding officer. We all ran into that circle of newts as they whirled about, and you could hear the oars as they thudded down on the newts backs. It was only then that the newts were startled and cowered down into the centre or tried to slide away into the sea between the oars, but those ones got hit with an oar that threw them back into the circle and they'd scream with the pain of it, and because they were so scared. Wed use a flagpole to push them back into the middle, squeeze them into a tight group, all lying on top of each other; ten men would round them up into a pen made of oars and another ten would use their oars to hit and shove the ones that tried to climb out under them and run away. It was just one mass of black, writhing meat, panicked and screaming as the oar blows landed on them in the darkness. Then they'd open up a gap between two of the oars; a newt would creep out of it and it'd be knocked down with a blow on the back of the head with a big stick; then there'd be another one and a third one until there were about twenty of them lying there. “Close it,” the officer ordered, and the gap between the two oars would shut. Bully Beach and Dingo, the half-cast, they'd take one of the stunned newts in each hand and drag them along the beach to the dinghy, just like sacks, not like living beings. If the newt that was being dragged along got caught between some stones the seaman dragging him would just pull harder and give a vicious tug so that a leg might be pulled off. “Don't you worry about that,” grumbled old Mike who was standing next to me. “It'll grow back again.” Once all the stunned newts had been thrown into the dinghy, the officer would just say, “Get the next lot ready.” And then it would start all over again, with the newts being clubbed on the back of the head. This officer, Bellamy, his name was, he was a quiet and educated man, an excellent chess player; but this was a hunt, or rather a business just like any other. There were more then two hundred newts knocked out like this; about seventy of them were left because they were probably dead an not worth the effort of dragging away. Back on board, the captured newts were thrown into a tank. Our ship was an old oil tanker and the tanks stank of oil because they hadn't been cleaned out properly, and the water had an obvious oily film over it. All that had been done was that the cover had been taken off so that the air could get to it. When the newts were thrown in it looked thick and repulsive, like some kind of noodle soup. In some places where they moved about they looked weak and pitiful. Over the next day they were left alone while they came to, then the day after, four men would come along and jab long poles into the soup, as everyone called it, they'd mix all the bodies together and watch to see if there were any that weren't moving or where the flesh was falling off; they'd hook them on long poles and pull them out of the tank. Then the captain would ask Is the soup clean?—Yes sir.—Pour the water in—yes sir. That soup had to be cleaned like this every day, and each time they'd throw six to ten pieces of damaged goods, as they called them, into the sea; there was always a lot of big and well fed sharks closely following our ship. The stink from the tanks was awful; despite being changed now and then the water in them was yellow, full of excrement and bits of wet food; there'd be these black bodies lying about in it, splashing wearily or just doing nothing, hardly able to breathe. Well they've got it good, old Mike insisted. I saw a ship once used to transport them in metal benzine barrels; they all died. Six days later we picked up new goods off the island of Nanomea. —— This then, is how the trade in newts is operated; an illegal business, modern piracy to be more exact, which burgeoned overnight, as it were. It is said that nearly a quarter of all the newts bought and sold have been hunted and captured in this way. Newts multiplied in the hatcheries which the Newt Syndicate no longer wished to maintain as farms and overran some of the smaller islands in the Pacific so much that they became a serious pest; the local people disliked them and insisted they put entire islands in danger of collapse because of the tunnels and passageways; so the colonial authorities and the Newt Syndicate itself turned a blind eye to the pirate raids where the newts lived. It was reckoned that there were as many as four hundred pirate ships occupied solely with hunting newts. As well as the small traders there were entire shipping companies acting as latter day buccaneers in this way, and the biggest of them was the Pacific Trade Company, based in Dublin with Charles B. Harriman as its managing director. A year earlier it had been even worse, with Teng, a bandit from China, would use his three ships to directly attack the farms of the syndicate itself and had no hesitation in killing the staff if they tried to stand in their way. The previous November, Teng and the whole of his fleet had been sunk by the American gunboat, Minnetonka, off Midway Island. Since then, the trade in newts had kept to less wild forms of piracy and enjoyed steady growth after certain procedures had been agreed on such as the ships national flag being hoisted when it attacks the shore of a foreign land, that no other goods would be traded in under the pretext of piracy, that the newts acquired would not be disposed of at dumping prices but would be designated inferior quality when put on the market. Newts in the illegal trade would be sold at between twenty and twenty-two dollars each; they are seen as inferior quality but very robust considering that they survived the terrible treatment on the pirate ships. It was estimated that, on average, twenty-five to thirty percent of newts captured went through this experience; and that they would be capable of going through more. In the trade jargon they were known as Maccaroni, and recently had begun to be listed in regular business reports. —— Two months later I was playing chess with Mr. Bellamy in the lounge of the Hotel France in Saigon; I wasn't contracted to a ship at that time, of course. “Bellamy,” I said to him, “you're a decent person, a gentleman, you might say. Doesn't it ever feel strange for you that you're doing something that, basically, is the lowest kind of slave trade?” Bellamy shrugged his shoulders. “Newts are newts,” he grumbled evasively. “Two hundred years ago they said niggers are niggers.” “And weren't they right?” said Bellamy. “Check!” I lost that game. It suddenly occurred to me that every move on the chessboard is old and has been played by somebody at some time. Maybe our own history has been played out by somebody at some time, and we just move our pieces about in the same moves to strike in the same way as people have always done. Maybe it was the same sort of quiet and decent Bellamy that used to hunt negroes on the Ivory Coast and transported them to HaÄti and Louisiana, letting them die on the lower decks. That Bellamy, back in those days thought nothing of it. This Bellamy never thinks anything of it. That's why he's incorrigible. “Black loses,” declared Bellamy cheerfully, and got up to go for a walk.] [11. We cite a report on the scientific congress in Paris by an eye-witness, r.d. Ier CONGR Ã S D'UROD Ã LES Known in short as the amphibians congress, the official title of the congress was somewhat longer: The First International Congress of Zoologists for Psychological Research into Caudate Amphibians. No true Parisian, though, likes long names such as this, so they referred to the learned professors who sat in the halls of the Sorbonne simply as Messieurs les Urod Äles, the newt men. Or else, even shorter and less respectful, those zoo men. So we went to have a look at those zoo men, not so much out of journalistic duty as out of simple curiosity. The curiosity, you understand, was not so much for the mostly aged and bespectacled scientists but for the...creatures (why do we feel difficulty in writing the word animal?) about whom so much has already been written both in scientific papers and in the popular press. There are some who say that what has been written is no more than journalistic humbug, but others say that these animals are in may respects more gifted than the Lord of the World and Crown of Creation himself, as man is still called—even after the World War and other incidents. I hoped that the venerable gentlemen taking part in the congress for research into the minds of caudate amphibians would provide a clear and final answer for us laymen as to Andrias Scheuchzer's fabled intelligence, that they would say to us yes, this is an intelligent being, or at least tell us that they are as capable of civilisation as you or I. For this reason, we should consider what the future might hold for these creatures just as we should consider what the future might hold for mankind, a race once thought so wild and primitive. I tell you there was no answer given, nor any question of this sort put to the congress; modern science has become too... specialised to concern itself with problems of this sort. So let us try to learn something about what a scientist would call animal psychology. That tall gentleman with the long beard now mounting the podium, that is the famous Professor Dubosque; he seems to be criticising some perverse theory by some esteemed colleague, but it is difficult for us to follow this side of his argument. Indeed, it is only after considerable time that we realise that this man speaking with the enthusiasm of a black magician is discussing the ability of Andrias to perceive colours and his ability to distinguish various shades. I cannot be sure that I understood properly, but I left with the impression that Andrias Scheuchzeri might be largely colour-blind, but that Professor Dubosque must be terribly short sighted going by the way he lifted his papers up to his thick, glasses that sparkled wildly in the light. Professor Dubosque was succeeded on the podium by the smiling Dr. Okagawa from Japan; he explained something about reaction times and other effects that result if he cut some kind sensory channel in Andrias's brain; then he told us how Andrias responds if part of the auditory system is crushed. Professor Rehmann, coming next, explained in detail how Andrias responds to electric shocks, at which a passionate dispute arose between him and Professor Bruckner. C'est un type, this Professor Bruckner: small, angry, and lively to an extent that verges on the tragic ; amongst other things, he asserted that the sense organs of Andrias are as weak as those of man and that he has the same limited instincts; looked at from a purely biological point of view, Andrias is an animal as degenerate as man, and just like man he tries to make up for these biological deficiencies by what is known as intellect. However, the other specialists seem not to have taken Professor Bruckner seriously, probably because he had not severed any sensory nerves and had not shot any electric charges into any newts brain. He was followed by Professor van Dieten who slowly and almost reverentially described the disorders that are seen in Andrias after the right temporal lobe of the brain has been removed or the occipital lobe from the left hand side. Then there was a reading from Professor Devrient from America... Forgive me, I am not quite sure what it was that Professor Devrient said in his reading as at that moment my head had begun to spin at the thought of what disorders would be seen in Professor Devrient if his right temporal lobe were removed; how the smiling Dr. Okagawa would respond if he were given electric stimulants and how professor Rehmann might behave if his auditory cavities were crushed. I also began to feel rather uncertain about my abilities to distinguish colours and my sensory-motor reactions. I started to be tortured with doubt as to whether (speaking strictly scientifically) we have any right to talk of our own (mankind's) spiritual life considering that we have not butchered each others cerebral lobes and cut sensory nerves. Should we turn on each other, scalpel in hand, to study each others spiritual life? As far as I am concerned I would be quite happy—in the interests of science—to smash professor Dubosque's glasses or shoot electric shocks into Professor Dieten's bald head and publish an article about how he reacts. In fact I can imagine how he would react quite vividly, although I find it harder to imagine what goes on in the would of Andrias Scheuchzer in experiments of this sort even though I know already that he is a boundlessly patient and good-natured creature as none of the lecturing professors mentioned any time that poor Andrias Scheuchzeri ever became angry. I am in no doubt that the First Congress on Caudate Amphibians has been a remarkable scientific success; but as soon as I have a day free I will be going to the Jardin des Plantes and straight to the tank where Andrias Scheuchzeri is held so that I can quietly say to him, “You, newt, your day will come one day...but please never think of examining the spiritual life of people!”] [12. The uses to which newts can be put was researched in particular by Wuhrmann in Hamburg, and this is just one short extract from his papers on the subject: BERICHT ÃBER DIE SOMATISCHE VERANLAGUNG DER MOLCHE In the experiments carried out by myself on the great Pacific newt (Andrias Scheuchzeri Tschudi) in my laboratory in Hamburg, I was directed by one certain objective: to examine the newts ability to withstand changes to their environment and other external influences and thus to show how they can be put to practical use in various parts of the world and under varying conditions. The first of the experiments was intended to ascertain how long the newt can survive away from water. The subjects were kept in a dry tank at a temperature of 40 to 50 degrees Celsius. After some hours they showed distinct signs of tiredness, but became more active if sprayed with water. After a period of twenty-four hours they lay motionless, moving nothing more than their eyelids; the pulse slowed, and all physical activities were reduced to a minimum. The animals were clearly suffering and the slightest movement cost them a great deal of effort. After three days they entered a state of cataleptic stillness (xerosis); they did not respond even if burned with an electric cauterisor. If the humidity of the air was raised, then they began to show certain signs of life (blinking if exposed to strong sources of light etc.) If a newt was thus dehydrated for seven days and then thrown into water it would it would take considerable time before it once again became active; but a large number of subjects deprived of water for a longer period perished. If left in direct sunshine they would die after only a few hours. In another experiment, subjects were forced to turn a crank handle in the dark and in a very dry environment. After a period of three hours their activity began to decline but became rose again after spraying with copious amounts of water. If the spraying was frequently repeated the animals continued to turn the crank for up to seventeen, twenty or, in one case, even twenty-seven hours, whereas a human subject acting as control was already quite exhausted after only five hours of this mechanical activity. From these experiments we can conclude that newts are well suited to work on dry land provided that two obvious conditions are observed; they cannot be exposed to direct sunlight and they need to be sprayed with water from time to time. The second series of experiments was intended to test the resistance of these originally tropical animals to cold. If cooled suddenly with water, the subjects would die from intestinal catarrh; however, if allowed slowly to acclimatise to a cold environment, the subjects would become used to it and after a period of eight months they even remained active in water at a temperature of 7Â° C, provided they were given extra fat in their diets (150 to 200 grams each). If the water temperature was reduced to below 5Â° C the subjects would become stiff (gelosis); in this state they could be frozen and kept in a block of ice for several months; when the ice was melted and the water temperature rose above 5Â ° C they would begin, once again, to show signs of life and at seven to ten degrees they would become lively and seek food. It can be seen from this that there is no difficulty in acclimatising newts even to our own climate as far as northern Norway and Iceland. For polar conditions, further experiments would be needed. In contrast with this, the subjects showed themselves remarkably sensitive to chemicals; in experiments using very dilute lye, discharge from factories, tanning fluids etc. , the skin fell off their bodies in broad strips and the subjects died from some kind of inflammation of the gills. This means that, for the conditions found in our rivers, newts are practically unusable. In another series of experiments, we were able to ascertain how long a newt is able to survive without food. They can be kept hungry for three weeks or even longer, showing no symptoms worse than a certain lethargy. I kept one of the newts hungry for a period of six months; after the first three months it slept continuously and without any kind of movement; when the newt was then thrown into a tub of chopped liver it was so weak that it showed no reaction and had to be fed by hand. After some days it began to eat normally and the newt concerned could be put to use in further experiments. The final series of experiments examined the newts ability to recover from injury. If a subjects tail was cut off it would regrow within fourteen days; this was attempted with one newt no less than seven times, each time with the same result. the same result was observed if the subjects feet were cut off. All four limbs and the tail were amputated from one subject; and within thirty days it was once again whole. If the thigh or shoulder bone of one of the animals is broken, the entire limb will fall off and a new one will be grown to replace it. The same result was obtained if a subjects eye or tongue was cut out; although one interesting observation was that the newt whose tongue had been removed lost the ability to speak and had to learn it all over again. If a newts head is amputated, or its body bisected anywhere between the neck and the pelvis, the animal dies. On the other hand, the stomach can be removed, part of the intestine, two thirds of the liver or other organs, without any disturbance to the animals life functions, so that we can say a newt that has been all but disembowelled is still capable of life. There is no other animal so resistant to any sort of injury than the true newt. This capacity would make of it a first-class, almost indestructible, animal for use in warfare if it were not for its peaceable nature and natural failure to defend itself. ... Alongside these experiments, my assistant, Herr Doktor Walter Hinkel, examined the newts to ascertain whether they could be a source of useful raw materials. We were interested in particular to ascertain whether the body of a newt contains a large quantity of iodine or phosphorus; and our positive results suggest it might be possible to extract these important elements on an industrial scale. The skin of a newt in its natural state does not have any serious use, it can however be ground to a paste and subjected to high pressure to create an artificial leather which is light and strong enough to offer a serious alternative to leather from the hides of cattle. Because of its repulsive odour, the fat in a newt's body is of limited use, but its very low freezing temperature makes it of possible value as a lubricant for machinery. The meat of a newt was likewise considered unusable, and even as poisonous; if consumed in its raw state it causes serious pains, vomiting and sensory hallucinations. After a large number of experiments conducted on himself, however, Dr. Hinkel was able to ascertain that these harmful effects disappear if slices of the meat are steamed (in this way it resembles certain mushrooms), thoroughly rinsed, and soaked for twenty-four hours in a weak solution of hypermanganese. It can then be boiled or steamed and tastes like poor quality beef. In this way we consumed the newt whom we had come to know as Hans; Hans was an educated and intelligent animal with a special talent for scientific work; it had worked in Dr. Hinkel's department as a laboratory assistant and could even be trusted with delicate chemical analyses. We would spend entire evenings talking with Hans who enjoyed boundless curiosity. It became unfortunately necessary to dispose of Hans after he became blind after my experiments with trepanation. Hans's meat was dark and with a slight flavour of mushrooms, but left no unpleasant effects. There is no doubt that in the event of need arising from war it would be possible to use newt meat as a cheap substitute for beef.] [13. This matter was reflected in a survey published in the Daily Star on the theme of Do Newts have a Soul? Here, we quote some of the statements by outstanding personalities from this survey (although of course with no guarantee of their truth): Dear Sir, A friend of mine, the Reverend H.B. Bertram, and I observed some newts over a long period while they were building a dam in Aden. We also spoke with them on two or three occasions, but we found no indications of any higher feelings such as Honour, Faith, Patriotism or interest in Sport. And what else, may I ask, is there that could be seen as an indication of a soul? Truly yours, Colonel John W. Britton.] [14. I have never seen a newt, but I am convinced that a being without music is a being without a soul. Toscani Leaving the question of a soul to one side, whenever I have had the opportunity to observe newts they have seemed to me to have no individuality; each one seems to be like the next, equally diligent, equally competent—and equally indistinguishable. In a word, they meet one of the ideals of modern civilisation, Mediocrity. AndrÃ© d'Artois It is quite certain that they do not have a soul. This is something they have in common with man. Yours, G.B. Shaw Your question left me feeling somewhat perplexed. I know, for example, that my little Chinese dog, Bibi, has a little and a charming soul; and I know that my Persian cat, Sidi Hanum has a soul, so wonderful and so cruel! But newts? Yes, they are very talented and intelligent, the poor things are able to speak, calculate and make themselves very useful; but they are so ugly! Yours, Madeleine Roche It's alright for them to be newts just as long as they're not Marxists Kurt Huber They have no soul. If they had, then we would have to put them on an economic par with mankind, and that would be absurd. Henry Bond They ain't got no sex-appeal. And that means they ain't got a soul. Mae West They do have a soul, just as every other animal and every plant and every living thing has a soul. Great indeed is the secret of any life. SandrabhÃ¡rata Nath They have an interesting swimming technique; there's a lot that we could learn from these newts, especially about long distance swimming. Johnny WeissmÃ¼ller] [15. Viz Mme. Louise Zimmermann, sa vie, ses idÃ©es, son eouvre (Alcan). We quote from this work the admiring memory of a newt who was one of her first pupils: “Sitting beside our simple but clean and comfortable tank, Mme. Zimmermann would read the legends of Lafontaine to us. The dampness was unpleasant for her, but she paid no attention as she was so engrossed in her task as our teacher. She called us mes petis chinois because, just like the Chinese, we were unable to pronounce the letter r, but after some time she became so used to it that she began to pronounce her own name as Mme. Zimmelmann. We tadpoles adored her; the little ones who still had not developed lungs and therefore were not able to leave the water, cried when they could no accompany her on her walks around the school garden. She was so loving and gentle that, as far as I know, there was only one occasion when she became cross; that was on one very hot day when the young lady who taught us history put on a bathing costume and got into the tank with us and told us about the struggle for independence in the Netherlands sitting up to her neck in water. Then our dear Mme. Zimmermann became truly angry: “Get out of there immediately Mademoiselle,” she shouted with tears in her eyes, “get out and wash yourself, get out, get out”. For us newts it was a clear but gentle lesson that we do not belong among people. Later on were grateful to our spiritual mother that she had made us conscious of this in such an emphatic and tactful way. “When we had studied hard, she would read us some modern poetry, such as FranÃ§ois CoppÃ ©a, as a reward. It is really rather too modern, she would say, but, after all, even that is part of a good education nowadays. At the end of the school year there was an open day to which the prefect of Nice and other important persons in government and other fields of excellence were invited. The most gifted and advanced pupils who already had their lungs were dried off by the caretaker and dressed in white; and then, behind a thin curtain so that they would not alarm the ladies, they would read out the fables of Lafontaine, mathematical formulae and the history of the Capet dynasty with all the important dates. Then the prefect would give a long and beautiful speech of thanks to our dear headmistress that brought the day to an end. As much care was given to our physical development as to our spiritual development; once a month we were inspected by the local vet and every six months each of us was weighed. Our dear mentor laid especial emphasis on the need to give up the disgusting and base habit of dancing to the moon; but I am sorry to say that some of the older students did commit this bestial disgrace in secret when the moon was full. I hope our friend and, as it were, mother never learned about this; it would have broken her great, noble and loving heart.”] [16. Amongst others, the famous linguist, Curtius, in the publication, Janua Linguarum aperta, suggested that the only general language to be adopted by newts should be the Latin of the golden age of Vergil. It is today within our grasp, he declared, for Latin, this most perfect of languages, the richest in grammatical rules and most developed in science, to once more be a living language in use in all parts of the world. If those educated parts of mankind do not take this opportunity then you, salamandrae, gens maritima, you should grasp it yourselves; choose for your home language eruditam linguam Latinam, the only language worthy of being spoken throughout orbis terrarum. Salamandrae, should you resurrect the eternal language of gods and heroes into new life then it will be a service that lasts forever; for, gens Tritonum, with this language we would be accepting the legacy of Rome that was the ruler of the world. In contrast with Curtius, a certain telegraph clerk in Lithuania by the name of Wolteras, working in collaboration with Pastor Mendelius, invented and developed a language specially for newts which he called puntic language; in it, he used elements from all the languages of the world, especially African languages. This newt language, as it became known, became quite popular, especially in the countries of the north, although, unfortunately, only among humans; in Uppsala there was even a chair in newt language founded but among the newts themselves there is no record of it being spoken by a single one. The truth is that the most popular language among the newts was Basic English, which later became the newts official language.] [17. Cf. an article by Jaromir Seidel-NovomÄstskÃ½, preserved in Mr. Povondra's collection of cuttings. OUR FRIEND IN THE GALÃPAGOS After the painful loss of our dear aunt, the author Mrs. Bohumila JandovÃ¡-StÅeÅ¡ovickÃ¡, my wife, the poetess JindÅicha SeidlovÃ¡-ChrudimskÃ¡, and I undertook a journey around the world so that the charm of so many new and powerful impressions might go at least some way to assuage our sorrow. We arrived on the GalÃ¡pagos Islands, so lonely and so swathed in legend, where we were spending two or three hours of free time in a promenade along the beach. “See how beautiful the sunset is today, my dear,” I said to my spouse. “Is it not as if the whole of the sky were drowning in a sea of blood and gold?” “Do I have the pleasure of speaking to a Czech gentleman?” I heard a voice say in pure and correct Czech, not far behind us. In surprise, we looked around us in that direction but there was no-one to be seen, only a large black newt sitting on a rock and holding in its hand something that looked like a book. In the course of our travels around the world we had already come across a large number of newts but had not had the opportunity of engaging with any of them in conversation. So, dear reader, you can understand our astonishment when, on an abandoned shore such as where we found ourselves, we came across a newt that addressed us in our own language. “Who is that speaking?” I asked, in Czech. “It was I who took that liberty, sir,” the newt replied very politely as it stood up. “I'm afraid it was the first time in my life that I heard Czech being spoken and I was unable to resist.” “But how come,” I asked in astonishment, “you speak Czech?” “Well I was just occupied with studying the conjugations of the irregular verb, to be,” the newt replied, “as this is a verb that is irregular in all languages of the world.” I pursued my question. “How where and why have you learned Czech?” “It was by mere good fortune that this book came into my hands,” the newt answered as it handed the aforementioned book to me; the book was Czech for Newts, and its pages bore the marks of frequent and diligent use. “It arrived on these shores as part of a consignment of books of an educational nature. I found myself offered the choice of Geometry for the Sixth Form, The History of Military Strategy, a guide to the Dolomites and The Principles of Bimetalism. This is the book I chose, and it has since become my second favourite. I already have its contents by heart, although it is still able to be a continual source of entertainment and education for me.” My lady wife and I expressed our unfeigned joy and wonderment at this news and the newt's near perfect pronunciation. “It is however unfortunate,” the newt continued modestly, “that there is no-one here with whom I am able to speak Czech, and I am even uncertain as to whether the word for 'horse' in the instrumental case is 'koni' or 'koÅmi'.” “It is 'koÅmi',” I informed the newt. “But no, it is 'koni',” objected my lady wife. “Would you be so kind as to tell me of the latest events in Prague, the mother of cities with its hundred towers?” asked our dear companion with great enthusiasm. “The city is growing, my friend,” I explained, pleased at his interest, and briefly adumbrated the recent efflorescence of our golden metropolis. “This does indeed portend well for the future,” replied the newt with unfeigned pleasure. “And are the heads of the Czech aristocrats still to be seen impaled around the towers?” “That was a long time ago,” I told him, somewhat (I confess) surprised by his question. “That is indeed a pity,” opined this likeable newt. “It was a historic monument of great value. We can be thankful to the Lord God that took so many remarkable historic monuments in the Thirty Years War! If I am not mistaken, the Czech lands were at that time transformed into a desert, stained with blood and tears. We can also be grateful that the negative genitive did not perish at that time. This book explains that it is currently disappearing, and I will be indeed sorry if that is indeed so.” “So you take an interest in our history,” I exclaimed with joy. “I do indeed,” the newt replied. “Especially the subjugation that followed the Battle of White Hill and the Thirty Years War. I have read a great deal on the matter in this book. I'm sure you must be very proud of your three centuries of subjugation. It was a great era for the Czech people.” “Yes, it was a difficult time,” I said, thinking to humour him. “A time of oppression and sorrow.” “And did you suffer greatly?” asked our friend with enthusiasm. “We suffered unspeakable and unrelenting sorrows under the yoke of the oppressor.” “I'm very glad to hear it,” the newt said with relief. “That's just what it says in the book. I'm glad to hear that it is true. It is an excellent book, sir, far better than Geometry for the Sixth Form. I would be very glad to stand on the memorable spot where the Czech aristocracy were executed, as well as on the other celebrated places of cruel wrongdoing.” “You must look in on us when you are there,” I invited sincerely. “Thank you for your kind invitation,” said the newt with a bow. “I am, however, unfortunately not at liberty to travel as far as...” “We could buy you,” I declared. “That is to say, the national collection might be willing to procure the means to... “Hearty thanks,” mumbled our friend, clearly touched. “But I have heard that the water of the Vltava is not good. You see, in river water we suffer severe diarrhoea.” Then he considered the matter a little and added, “and I would also be sorry to abandon my dear little garden.” “Oh,” exclaimed my lady wife, “I am also very fond of gardening! I should be very grateful if you would show us something of the local flora!” “With the greatest of pleasure, dear lady,” said the newt, bowing most politely. “If, that is, it is of no concern to you that my garden is under water.” “Under water?” “Indeed, two hundred metres under water.” “But how is it possible to cultivate flowers two hundred metres under water?” “Sea anemones,” our friend informed us, “including some very rare species. There are also starfish and sea cucumbers, not to mention the bushes of coral. To cultivate one rose is to cultivate one's homeland, as the poet tells us.” It was necessary for us to make our departure, for the ship had already given its signal. “And what message do you have, Mr....” I asked, uncertain as to the name of our dear companion. “My name is Boleslav JablonskÃ½,” the newt told us shyly. “I consider it to be a very beautiful name, sir. I chose it myself from this book.” “And what message do you have, Mr. JablonskÃ½, for us to convey back to our people?” The newt considered the matter for a short while. “You may tell your compatriots,” he said slowly, deeply moved, “tell them...that they should always maintain the ancient disagreements among the Slavonic peoples...that they should always retain Lipany and the defeat at White Hill in their grateful memory. Farewell,...” he ended suddenly, attempting to overcome his feelings. As we departed in the dinghy back to the ship, full of thoughts and tender feelings, our friend stood on the rocks and waved to us, and as he did so he seemed to call something out to us. “What was that, he cried?” asked my lady wife. “I do not know,” I answered, “but it sounded something like, 'give my greetings to the mayor, Dr. Bax'.”] [18. In Germany in particular all vivisection was strictly forbidden, albeit, of course, only for Jewish researchers.] [ 19. This seems also to have affected certain ethical movements. Among the articles in Mr. Povondra's collection was a declaration published in newspapers all around the world, translated into many different languages and even signed by the Duchess of Huddersfield. It read: “Women of the world, in the interests of decency and morality the League for the Protection of Newts calls on you to contribute your handiwork to our campaign to provide newts with suitable clothing. The most suitable garment would be a skirt 40 cm. long, 60 cm. at the waist and preferably fitted with elastic. The skirt should be pleated to enable better ease of movement for the wearer. For tropical areas, a mere apron will be adequate, fitted with the means to fasten it at the waist, which could be made from very simple working materials such as some of your own discarded clothing. In this way you will remove the need for the unfortunate newts to work in public and in the presence of human beings without any sort of decent covering, which they cannot do otherwise than feel as an insult to their dignity and which could only be a cause of unease for any decent person, especially women and mothers.” There is no indication anywhere that this call met with any success; it is not known whether any newts ever chose to wear a skirt or an apron; it would probably have got in their way underwater and been difficult to keep up. And wherever the newts were separated from human beings behind a wooden fence there would have been, of course, no reason for either humans or newts to feel any shame or emotional discomfort. The idea that the newts needed to be protected from harassment of various sorts was mainly because of dogs, which never were able to get used to them and would chase the newts in a barking frenzy, even under water and despite the fact that if they ever bit a newt it would leave a caustic slime in their mouths. There were even times when the newts would defend themselves and more than one doughty hound was killed with a pickaxe or crowbar. Between dogs and newts there developed a permanent, deadly enmity which was intensified, rather than weakened, when a physical barrier was put between them. But that is often the case, and not only between dogs. These fences, coated with tar and stretching often along hundreds and hundreds of kilometres of coastline, were also used to teach the newts proper behaviour, and along the whole length of them they were painted with large letters urging the, for instance: Your work— Your success Value every second! The day has only 86,400 seconds! You're only worth as much as you work A meter of dam can be built in 57 minutes! The worker serves us all Who will not work, let him not eat! And so on. Considering that these wooden fences stretched along more than three hundred thousand kilometres of coastline around the world, you can imagine how many encouraging slogans would fit onto them and how much they were of benefit to everyone.] [20. The first trial of a newt, that took place in Durban, was of great interest to the press all round the world (viz Mr. Povondra's collection of cuttings). The port authority in A. employed a working colony of newts. In the course of time they multiplied so much that the port soon did not have enough room for them all; some tadpoles began to establish new colonies out on the surrounding coastline. Part of this coastline was on the property of farmer B. and he asked the port authority to remove the newts from his private beach because he liked to bathe there. The port authority refused, saying the matter was nothing to do with them as the newts, having settled on his land, had become his private property. While these protracted negotiations continued, the newts, partly from instinct and partly because of the eagerness for work that had been inculcated in them, began, without the appropriate orders or permission, to construct a dyke and a dock on Mr. B.'s stretch of beach. At this, Mr. B. made a complaint with the appropriate office to for damage to his property. At first the complaint was rejected on the grounds that Mr. B.'s land, far from being damaged, had been enhanced by the newts' activities, but this decision was overturned and verdict was passed in favour of the complainant on the grounds that no-one should have to tolerate a neighbour's domesticated animals on his land. The port authority in A. was held responsible for all the damage caused by the newts just as a farmer would be held responsible for damage caused to a neighbour by his cattle. The port authority, of course, objected that it could not be held responsible for the newts because in the sea they could not be fenced in. The neighbour declared that in his view the damage caused by the newts should be seen in the same way as damage caused by chickens which likewise could not be fenced in because they were able to fly. Counsel for the port authority asked how his client was expected to remove the newts or force them to leave Mr. B.'s private beach. The judge answered that that was no concern of the court. Counsel asked whether it would be acceptable to the honourable judge if the port authority had these undesirable newts shot. The judge answered that as an Englishman and a gentleman he would consider that highly inappropriate as well as a violation of Mr. B.'s hunting rights. The port authority was therefore required to remove the newts from the complainant's private property, to remove the damage caused by the newts' having constructed dams and waterworks there and to restore that stretch of beach to its original state. Counsel for the defendant asked whether his client would be allowed to use salamanders for this demolition work. The judge replied that this would certainly not be allowed unless the complainant gave his permission, which was in doubt because the complainants' wife found the newts repellent and was unable to bathe on a beach infested with newts. The port authority objected that without newts it would not be possible to remove the waterworks constructed below the waterline. At this, the judge declared that it was no matter of the court to make decisions on technical details and had no wish to do so; courts were there to protect private property, not to decide what was feasible and what not. In this way the matter was brought to its end. It is not known how the port authority in A. got round this difficult problem; but the whole matter goes to show that the newt problem will need to be regulated with new judicial provisions that address it directly.] [21. There were some who took the matter of equal rights for newts literally, and asked that salamanders be allowed to establish government offices under water and on land (J. Courtaud); or that they should form fully armed underwater regiments with their own underwater commander (General M. S. Desfours); or even that mixed marriages between newts and humans should be allowed (Louis Pierrot, avocat). scientists objected that marriages of this sort would not be possible; but Mister Pierrot declared that it was not a matter of natural possibilities but of a legal principle and that he himself would be willing to take a newt female for his wife in order to show that this reform of the legal principle of marriage need not remain merely on paper. (Later in his career, Mister Pierrot became a highly sought after divorce lawyer.) At this point it is worth mentioning that the press, especially in the United States, would occasionally publish reports of girls who had been raped by a newt while bathing. As a result, the number of cases in America where a newt was captured and lynched or burned alive multiplied rapidly. Scientists came forward to protest at this folk custom, insisting that it their anatomy made it physically impossible for any newt to commit a crime of this sort, but their words were in vain; too many girls had sworn that they had been assaulted by a newt and so for any regular American the matter was clear. Later on at least, the sport of burning a newt alive was only allowed to take place on a Saturday and under the supervision of the fire brigade. The Society for the Prevention of the Lynching of Newts was established under the leadership of the Reverend Robert J. Washington and counted hundreds of thousands of members, of whom almost all were mere negroes, including the Reverend Washington. The American press began to maintain that this was a political movement with the intention of overturning the government; as a result the areas inhabited by negroes came under attack and many of them were themselves burned alive, especially those who prayed for Brother Newt in their churches. The climax of indignation against negroes reached its peak when a black church in Gordonville (L.) was burned down and the fire spread to the whole of the city. (But this is only incidental to the story of the newts.) We can at least list a few of the advantages that the newts really did receive; each salamander was listed in a registry of newts with the place where he worked; it was required to obtain an official residence permit; it had to pay income tax which, as the newts received no wages as money, was paid by its owner who would then deduct it from the newt's food; it was likewise required to pay rent for the coastline where it lived, local tax and contribute to the erection and upkeep of the wooden fences; school taxes and other public costs; in short, we have to admit that the newts, in this respect, were treated no differently than any other citizen and in this way enjoy full equality.] [22. Viz encyclical from the holy father, Mirabilia Dei Opera.] [23. There were so many publications on this subject that simply to list them would occupy two large volumes.] [24. The papers in Mr. Povondra's collection included a highly pornographic brochure which, according to police reports, had been published in B ***. It is not possible to quote the contents of this “private publication, issued in the interests of scientific knowledge” in any respectable book. Instead we will merely cite a few of its details: The temple of the salamander cult, to be found at number *** in *** Street, has, at its centre, a large pool panelled with dark red marble. The water in the pool is perfumed with fragrant essences, warmed, and illuminated from below with continuously changing coloured lights; all else in the temple is darkness. At the chant of the newt liturgy, the entirely naked followers of the cult step into the rainbow coloured pool down marble steps, men on one side, women on the other. Many of its adherents belong to the highest society, such as Baroness M., S., the film star, D., the member of parliament, and many other outstanding personalities. Suddenly, a blue light shines on an enormous marble block that emerges from the water and on which there is an ancient black newt, lying at rest but breathing heavily. This is Master Salamander. There is a period of silence, and then Master Salamander begins to speak; he calls on the faithful to devote themselves and with all their souls to the forthcoming ceremonies of the salamander dance and to revere the Great Salamander. Then he raises himself and begins to sway and vigorously twist the upper half of his body. The male members of the faithful, immersed up to their necks in water, begin also to twist and swing in a frenzy that becomes faster and faster in order, so they say, to create the sexual medium while to salamanders utter loud ts-ts-ts and raucous croaking. Then the coloured lights under the water go out one after another and the orgy begins. We cannot be sure that this description is entirely reliable, but it is certain that the police in al the major cities of Europe not only spent large resources on persecuting these salamander sects but also spent large resources on covering up the enormous scandals associated with them. It seems that although the cult of the salamander was very widespread its ceremonies did not always take place in the fairy tale splendour described here and that, among the lower classes, they took place on dry land.] [25. The Catholic prayers mentioned above also defined the newts as a kind of Dei Creatura de gente Molche (Creatures of God in the Nation of Newts).] [26. The declaration, preserved among Mr. Povondra's papers, went as follows: COMRADES NEWTS! The capitalist world order has found its latest victim. When the proletariat, newly aware of class consciousness, made the putrescent tyranny of capitalism shake in fear of revolution, the exploiters had to find a new servant to bend to its needs and took you, Workers of the Sea, to be the new slaves of bourgeois civilisation, took your spirit, subjected you to repressive laws, took away any freedom you ever had and did all in its power for you to be exploited by its friends with impunity. (14 lines missing) Working newts! The time is coming when you will be aware of the burden of slavery to which you are subject (7 lines missing) and claim your rights as a class and as a nation!

The final battle has begun. Signed: Molokov] [27. We were able to find only a few declarations of this sort in Mr. Povondra's collection; the others were probably burned over the years by Mrs. Povondra. Of the remaining material, we can at least cite a few titles: Newts, throw down your arms! (Pacifist manifesto) Newts, throw the Jews out! (German flysheet) Comrades Newts! (Anarchist-Bakuninists) Comrades Newts! (Sea scouts) Newts, our friends! (Public address by the Union of Aquarists' and Marine Life Cultivators' Societies) Our friends, the Newts! (Society for Moral Regeneration) Citizens Newts! (Citizens' Reform Society, Dieppe) Newts, our colleagues, come and join our ranks! (Society for the Support of Former Seamen) Our colleagues, Newts! (Aegir Sailing Club) One of these declarations had been carefully glued in place by Mr. Povondra and seems therefore to have been especially important. We therefore quote it here in full: ] [28. In Mr. Povondra's collection we found a lightweight, rather superficial description of this celebration, although, unfortunately, only the first half. The second half seems to have become lost. Nice, 6th May. There's lively activity today in the light and charming offices of the Institute for Mediterranean Studies on the Promenade des Anglais; two agents de police are holding the clear for invited guests to stride up the red carpet into the welcoming and pleasantly cool amphitheater. There's the smiling mayor of Nice there and the local prefect in his top hat, there's a general in his light blue uniform and gentlemen wearing the red button of the League of Honor, ladies of a certain age (terracotta seems to be the fashionable color this season), vice-admirals, journalists, professors and elderly celebrities from all round the world such as you find on the C Ã´ te d'Azur at any time of year. Suddenly something happens to disturb this honorable assembly when a strange little creature appears and tries to make its way unseen among them; it's covered from head to foot in some kind of long black cowl or cape, its eyes are covered with enormous dark glasses, and suddenly and unsure of itself it tries to enter the crowded vestibule. “HÃ©, vous,” shouts a policeman, “qu'est-ce que vous cherchez ici?” But then one of the distinguished university staff appears beside the startled figure and then it's this way, cher docteur, as you please, cher docteur. This is Dr. Charles Mercier, an educated newt who, today, is due to give a lecture to all the best people on the CÃ´te d'Azur! Let us hurry inside to find a seat in the excited auditorium! On the podium sit Monsieur le Maire, Monsieur Paul Mallory the great poet, Mme. Maria Dimineanu on behalf of the International Institute for Intellectual Co-operation, the rector of the Institute for Mediterranean Studies, and other official figures; to one side of the podium there's a lectern, and beside it... yes folks, that really is a tin bathtub I can see there, a perfectly ordinary tin bathtub such as you might have in your own bathroom. Two porters accompany the timid figure, concealed beneath his long cape, onto the podium, and the applause from the audience seems somewhat ill-at-ease. Dr. Charles Mercier bows shyly and looks round, uncertain as to where he is to be seated. “VoilÃ¡, Monsieur,” whispers one of the porters, pointing out the tin bathtub. “That's for you, sir.” It's obvious that Dr. Mercier feels highly embarrassed and is uncertain how he's to turn down such attentiveness by his hosts; he tries his best to sit down in the tub without drawing attention to the situation but his long cape gets caught up in his feet and fall down into the tub with a loud splash that soaks all these gentlemen on the podium who, needless to say, pretend that nothing at all has happened; somebody in the audience begins to laugh hysterically, but the people in the front row look round and admonish him with a loud 'shh!'. Then Monsieur le Maire et DÃ©putÃ© stands up and begins to speak. Ladies and gentlemen, he says, it is my honor to welcome to the beautiful city of Nice Doctor Charles Mercier, the outstanding scientist among our near neighbors who lie in the depths of the sea. (Dr. Mercier stands up in the water and gives the audience a deep bow.) This is the first time in the history of civilization that land and sea have worked hand in hand in intellectual pursuits. Until now, there was a clear boundary that our spiritual lives were not able to cross; that was the oceans that surround us. We were able to sail across them, we were able to plough our way through the waves in our boats in any direction we wanted; but, ladies and gentlemen, it was not possible for civilization to penetrate beneath its surface. The sea that surrounds the little pieces of land occupied by mankind has always, until now, been something wild and unknown; at same time as it offered us astonishing possibilities it has always kept us away; on the one had we saw the rise of civilization and on the other we saw nature, eternal and never changing. The barriers created for us by the oceans, dear listeners, are now falling away. (Applause) It is to us, the children of this great age we live in, that comes the great fortune to be eye-witnesses to the process of our spiritual home expanding, to see it burst out from its own shores and enter the waves of the sea, to conquer the depths of the sea and combine the ancient knowledge of the oceans with the modernity of civilization. That is an inspiring prospect! (Bravo!) Ladies and gentlemen, it is now that, for the first time ever, the culture of the oceans has appeared and here with us today we have its most eminent representative whom we have the honor to welcome here among us. Our planet has become a planet that is truly and wholly civilized. (Enthusiastic applause. Dr. Mercier, in the bathtub, stands and bows.) Monsieur le Maire and DÃ© putÃ© then turned to Dr. Mercier, who was supporting himself on the edge of the bathtub, deeply touched and sucking hard on his gills; My dear doctor, as a great scientist you will be able to convey our best wishes to your friends and compatriots on the seabed, to tell them how we admire them and sympathise with them. We send our greetings to those at the forefront of progress and knowledge, a forefront which, step by step, will colonise the endless expanses of the sea and create a new world of culture on the seabed. I can already see the rise of a new Athens, a new Rome in the depths of the oceans, the efflorescence of a new Paris with an underwater Louvre and an underwater Sorbonne with an underwater Arc de Triomphe and an underwater War Memorial, with underwater theaters and underwater boulevards. Allow me to express one of my most secret thoughts: it is my fondest hope that in the blue waves of the Mediterranean, just here off the shore of our city, there will be a new Nice, a glorious Nice that will be your Nice with her own majestic avenues under the sea, her own meadows and promenades alongside our CÃ´te d'Azur. We welcome you, and look forward to a deeper acquaintance; I am personally convinced that closer social and scientific contacts between us, making such an auspicious beginning here today, will lead our nations to ever closer cultural and political co-operation in the interests of all of mankind, world peace, prosperity and progress. (Long applause). Now, Dr. Charles Mercier stands up and does his best to thank the mayor and representative of Nice; but he seems to be too touched by the occasion, or else his pronounciation is rather too strange for us to understand; all that I could catch from what he said with such difficulty was a few words; if I am not mistaken they were “great honor"", “cultural contacts” and “Victor Hugo”. Then, clearly overwhelmed by the experience, he hid himself back in the bathtub. After this it was the turn of Paul Mallory to speak, but what he said was not so much a speech as an anthem, lit with the poetry of deep philosophy. I thank my fate, he said, that I have lived to see one of mankind's most beautiful myths fulfilled and confirmed in such a strange way. Instead of the mythical Atlantis sinking under the waves we have the astonishing sight of a new Atlantis emerging from the deep. Doctor Mercier, you are a poet of geometry, you, along with your learned colleagues, are the first ambassadors from this new world from the sea, not Aphrodite born of the foam but Pallas Anadyomene. Strangest of all though, of a mystery incomparable with... (end missing)] [29. Among Mr. Povondra's papers was a rather unclear newspaper photograph showing both newt delegates going up the steps onto the Quai du Mont Blanc on Lake Geneva to take their places at the commission. Lake Leman seems to have been their official accommodation. The Commission for the Study of the Newt Question achieved a great and useful function, mainly by settling all difficult questions in politics and economics. It was in permanent session for many years and met on more than thirty occasions, diligently concerned with unifying the international terminology for newts which, up till then, had been in hopeless chaos. Besides the scientific terms of 'salamander', 'newt', 'batrachus' and so on, which had begun to take on a rather disrespectful character, there were many other different names suggested. the newts could be referred to as 'tritons', 'neptunids', 'bathyds', 'Abyssals', 'hydrions', 'gens de mer', 'soumarins' and so on. It the task of the commission to select the most suitable name, and it was vigorously active in this affair right up to the end of the newt age; although it never did arrive at any final and unambiguous conclusion.] [30. Mr. Povondra also included two or three articles to do with national politics in his collection. These were about modern youth, and were probably only by mistake that he thought they were about the civilisation of the newts.] [31. One gentleman from the north of Prague told Mr. Povondra about the time he was bathing off the beach at Katwijk aan Zee. He had swum far out into the sea when the lifeguard called out to him, saying he should return to the beach. The gentleman concerned paid no attention and swam further out; then the lifeguard jumped into his boat and paddled out after him. “Swimming isn't allowed here, you know,” he said to him. “Why on Earth not?” the gentleman asked. “There are newts here.” “I'm not afraid of newts,” he objected. “They have some kind of factory or something under the water,” the lifeguard admonished. “Nobody is allowed to bathe here.” “But why not?” “The newts don't like it.”]","‘ Voild, Monsieur,* whispers a functionary, pointing to the bath tub. ‘ That’s for you.’ Dr Mercier is clearly very embarrassed but does not know how he can refuse this attentive arrangement; he tries to get into the bath as unobtrusively as possible, but he gets tangled up in his long cape and with a noisy splash falls into the water. The gentlemen on the dais get splashed quite a bit but of course behave as if nothing has happened; someone in the audience giggles hysterically but the gentlemen in the front rows turn their heads disapprovingly and hiss pssst! At that moment Monsieur le Maire et Depute rises to his feet and starts to speak. ‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ he says, ‘I have the honour to welcome Dr Charles Mercier to our fair city of Nice. Dr Mercier is an outstanding representative of our near neighbours, the denizens of the deep sea.’ (Dr Mercier half emerges from his tub and bows deeply.) ‘This is the first time in the history of civilisation that the sea and the land are joining hands in scientific collaboration. In the past our intellectual life has come up against an impassable barrier: the world ocean. We could cross it, we could sail our ships on it in all directions, but, ladies and gendemen, civilisation was unable to penetrate below its surface. That small piece of land on which mankind lives had hitherto been surrounded by a virgin sea, a wild sea; it had been a beautiful frame but also an age-old divide: on one side a rising civilisation and on the other eternal and unchanging nature. That barrier, dear ladies and gentlemen, is now falling. (Applause) We, the children of this great epoch, have been granted the incomparable happiness to be eye-witnesses to the growth of our spiritual homeland, to watch it cross our shoreline, descend into the sea’s waves, conquer the deep, and link a modern and civilised ocean to our ancient civilised land. What a fantastic experience! (Bravo!) Ladies and gentlemen, only by the emergence of an oceanic culture, whose eminent representative we have the honour to welcome in our midst today, has our planet become truly and wholly civilised.’ (Enthusiastic applause. Dr Mercier rises from his bath and bows.) ‘Dear doctor and great scientist’ - Monsieur le Maire et Depute then turned to Dr Mercier who was holding on to the edge of the bath, his gills twitching heavily with emotion - ‘you will be able to pass on to your fellow-countrymen and friends on the sea-bed our congratulations, our admiration and our warmest sympathy. Tell them that in you, our marine neighbours, we welcome the vanguard of progress and education, a vanguard that will, step by step, colonise the boundless regions of the sea and establish a new world of culture on the ocean floor. I can see rising within the depths of the ocean a new Athens and a new Rome; I can see flourishing there a new Paris with submarine Louvres and Sorbonnes, with submarine Triumphal Arches and Tombs of Unknown Warriors, with theatres and boulevards. And permit me to utter my most secret thought: I hope that, facing our beloved Nice, there will arise under the blue waves of the Mediterranean a new glorious Nice, your Nice, its magnificent submarine roads, parks and promenades forming an ornamental edge to our azure coast. We hope to get to know you better, and we hope you will come to know us better; personally, I am convinced that closer scientific and social contacts, such as we are inaugurating this day under such happy auspices, will lead our nations towards ever closer cultural and political co-operation for the good of all mankind, in the interest of world peace, prosperity and progress.’ (Prolonged applause) Dr Charles Mercier next rose and tried with a few words to thank the Mayor and Deputy for Nice; but for one thing he was too moved and for another his pronunciation was a little strange so that, from his whole speech, I caught only a few laboriously uttered words; unless I am mistaken they included ‘deeply honoured’, ‘cultural relations’ and ‘Victor Hugo’. After that, evidently very nervous, he hid again in his tub. The next speaker was Paul Mallory; what he delivered was not an address but a hymnic poem illumined by a profound philosophy. ‘I am grateful to Destiny,’ he said, ‘that I have lived to see the fulfilment and confirmation of one of mankind’s most beautiful legends. It is a strange confirmation and fulfilment: instead of a mythical Adantis that has sunk beneath the waves we are watching, with amazement, a new Atlantis rising from the deep. Dear colleague Mercier, you, who are a poet of spatial geometry, and your learned friends, are the first ambassadors of that new world which is rising from the sea - not Aphrodite rising from the foam but Pallas Anadyomene. But far more amazing and infinitely more mysterious is the fact that … ‘(the rest is missing). 24 Preserved among Mr Povondra’s papers is a rather blurred newspaper photograph showing the two Newt delegates climbing the steps from the Quai du Mont Blanc on the shore of Lake Geneva, to make their way to the sitting of the Commission. It would appear therefore that they were officially accommodated in Lake Geneva itself. As for the Geneva Commission for the Study of the Newt Question, its important and meritorious work lay chiefly in that it was careful to avoid all controversial political and economic issues. It was permanently in session for a large number of years, with over 500 sittings, at which there was much talk of an internationally unified terminology for the Newts. The fact was that hopeless chaos reigned in that field: alongside the scientific terms Salamandra, Molche, Batrachus and others (terms that they were beginning to regard as rather offensive) a whole string of other titles was proposed. The Newts were to be called Tritons, Neptunids, Tethyds, Nereids, Atlants, Oceanics, Poseidons, Lemurs, Pelagics, Litorales, Bathyds, Abyssides, Hydrions, Zhandemeres (Gens deMer), Soumarins, etc. The Commission for the Study of the Newt Question was to chose the most suitable name from this list of suggestions, and it was zealously and conscientiously absorbed in that task until the very end of the Newt Age. Admittedly, no final or unanimous conclusion was ever reached."

Nad pokojnou hladinou laguny se tu a tam vynořují černé hlavy a táhnou se ke břehu. Kapitán svírá rty a sahá neklidně po revolveru. Bylo by líp, myslí si, kdyby ty ženské zůstaly na lodi. Judy se počíná třást a drží se křečovitě Freda. Jak je silný, myslí si, bože, jak ho mám ráda!","Meanwhile, the captain is looking at the situation. There, on the surface of the bay, a straight, long strip glistens, separating the undulating sea from the quiet pool of the lagoon. It's like there's a dam or a breakwater underwater, the captain thinks, maybe it's sand or a coral reef, but it almost looks like a work of art. Strange place. Above the calm surface of the lagoon, black heads emerge here and there and stretch to the shore. The captain purses his lips and reaches restlessly for his revolver. It would be better, he thinks, if the women stayed on the ship. Judy begins to shake and clings to Fred. How strong he thinks, God, how I love him!","The captain had his eye on the situation. Out on of the bay he could see a long, glittering band where the waves of the sea met the smooth and level surface of the lagoon. It's as if there were some kind of weir or breakwater under the water there, he thought; it could be sand, or a coral reef, but it looks almost as if it were artificial. Strange place. Here and there on the peaceful surface of the lagoon a black head would appear and make its way to the shore. The captain pursed his lips and reached uneasily for his revolver. It would have been better, he thought, if the women had stayed on board the yacht. Judy began to shiver and held tightly onto Fred. He's so strong, she thought, God I love him so much!","Meanwhile, the captain was taking stock of the situation. Out there on the surface a long straight band was shimmering, dividing the rippling sea from the still water of the lagoon. Almost as if there was some dam or breakwater under the surface, the captain thought; maybe a sandbar or a coral reef, but it almost looked like an artificial structure. Queer spot, this. Above the still surface of the lagoon black heads were popping up here and there, moving towards the beach. The captain pressed his lips together and nervously fingered his revolver. Would have been better, he thought, if those women had stayed behind on the ship. Judy was beginning to tremble and frantically clutched Fred. How strong he is, she thought. God, how I love him!"

"Kdo by byl řekl, že uplynulo tolik vody a let! Vždyť ani náš pan Povondra už není vrátným v domě G. H. Bondyho, je to nyní, abychom tak řekli, velebný stařec, který může v klidu požívat plodů svého dlouhého a přičinlivého života v podobě malé penzičky, ale kam by stačilo těch pár stovek při téhle válečné drahotě! Ještě že sem tam člověk chytí nějakou tu rybku, sedí ve člunu s prutem v ruce a dívá se - co té vody za den uplyne a kde se jí tolik nabere! Někdy se chytne na udičku bělice, někdy je to vokoun, vůbec těch ryb je teď nějak víc, asi proto, že ty řeky jsou dnes o tolik kratší. On takový vokoun taky není špatný, je to sic malá kostička, ale maso chutná drobet po mandlích. A maminka je umí dělat. Pan Povondra ani neví, že maminka zatápí pod jeho vokouny obyčejně těmi výstřižky, které kdysi sbíral a třídil. Pravda, pan Povondra toho sbírání nechal, když šel do penze, zato si pořídil akvárium, kde vedle zlatých kapříků pěstoval maličké čolky a salamandry, po celé hodiny se na ně díval, jak leží nehybně ve vodě nebo vylézají na břeh, který jim udělal z kamenů, potom kroutil hlavou říkaje: ""Kdo by to do nich řekl, maminko!"" Ale člověk nevydrží jenom se dívat, proto se pan Povondra dal na rybaření. Co dělat, mužští vždycky musejí něco mít, myslí si shovívavě maminka Povondrová. Je to lepší, než kdyby chodil do hospody a dělal politiku.","Who would have thought that so much water and years have passed! After all, even our Mr. Povondra is no longer a doorman in G. H. Bondy's house, it is now, so to speak, a majestic old man who can enjoy the fruits of his long and active life in the form of a small pension, but where the few hundred would be enough in this war. dearly! Even if a person catches a fish here and there, he sits in a boat with a rod in his hand and watches - what time will pass in that day and where will it get so much! Sometimes he catches a whitefish, sometimes it's a wolf, there are some more fish now, probably because the rivers are so much shorter today. He is not a bad vowel either, it is a small cube, but the meat tastes a little almonds. And mom can make them. Mr. Povondra doesn't even know that his mother usually floods his vowels with the clippings he once collected and sorted. True, Mr. Povondra stopped the collection when he retired, but he bought an aquarium where he grew tiny newts and salamanders next to golden carp, watched for hours as they lay motionless in the water or climbed to the shore, which he made from stones, then shook his head saying, ""Who would say that to them, Mommy!"" But you can't just watch, so Mr. Povondra went fishing. What to do, men always have to have something, thinks mother Povondrová. It's better than going to a pub and doing politics.","Who would have thought so much time had flowed by? Our Mr. Povondra isn't even the doorman any more at G.H. Bondy's house; now, you might say, he is a venerable old man who can enjoy the fruits of his old and industrious life in peace as a pensioner; although his pension doesn't go very far these times of high wartime prices! He still goes out now and then to do some fishing; sitting in his boat with his fishing rod and watching how the water flows by day after day and all the things that go by with it! Sometimes he hooks a dace, sometimes a bass; there seem to be more of them nowadays, maybe because all the rivers are so much shorter. Mind you, there's nothing wrong with a nice bass; It's a bit boney sometimes, but the flesh is nice, tastes a bit like almonds. And mother knows just how to cook it. What Mr. Povondra doesn't know, though, is that mother usually uses those newspaper cuttings that he used to collect and arrange for the fire to cook the bass. He didn't keep up his collection, though, not went he started taking his pension; he got himself an fish tank instead where he keeps some goldfish; and he keeps some little newts in there too; sits there for hours, he does, watching them as they lay in the water without moving, or climbing out onto the little bank he made them with some gravel; then hell turn round and say: “Who'd have thought it, mother?” But you've got to do more than just sit there and watch, that's why Mr. Povondra took up keeping fish. Keep yourself busy, you've always got to keep yourself busy, thought Mother Povondra contentedly. Better than if he went out drinking or got involved in politics.","Who would have said that so much water and so many years had passed under the bridge! Even our Mr Povondra is no longer the doorman at the G. H. Bondy residence; he is now what you might call a venerable old gentleman, peacefully enjoying the fruits of his long and conscientious life in the form of a small pension. But how far will a few hundreds go with these horrendous wartime prices? A good job that a chap can now and again catch a fish or two: there he would sit in his boat, rod in hand, gazing - all that water flowing past in just a single day, and where did it all come from? Sometimes he would hook a dace and sometimes a perch; there were somehow or other more fish about, probably because the rivers were so much shorter. Not a bad fish, actually, perch; true, most of it was bones but the flesh tasted a little like almonds. And Mother certainly knew how to do them. Mr Povondra, of course, did not know that the fire on which his wife cooked those perch was usually lit with those newspaper cuttings which he used to collect and sort. To tell the truth, Mr Povondra gave up collecting when he retired; instead he got himself an aquarium where, along with little golden carp he kept small newts and salamanders; he would look at them for hours on end as they lay there motionless or crawled out on the bank of stones he had built for them; then he would shake his head and say: ‘Who’d have thought it of them, Mother!’ But a man can’t just sit and stare; that’s why Mr Povondra took up fishing. And why not, men must always have something to do, Mother Povondra thought indulgently. Better that than if he went to the pub to argue politics!"

Nevím, čeho se máme bát víc: zda jejich lidské civilizace, nebo jejich potměšilé, chladné a zvířecí krutosti, ale to dvoje dohromady dává něco nepředstavitelně děsivého a téměř ďábelského.

"Dr. Manoel Carvalho, veliký právník lisabonský, poděkoval za tuto nabídku, kterou bude tlumočit vládě Mloků, každé dítě však pochopí, řekl, že budovat nové pevniny je daleko zdlouhavější a nákladnější než odbourávat staré země. Naši klienti potřebují nových břehů a zátok v době nejkratší, to je pro ně otázka bytí a nebytí. Bylo by pro lidstvo lépe přijmout ženerózní nabídku Chief Salamandra, který je dnes ještě ochoten koupit svět od lidí, místo aby se ho zmocnil násilím. Naši klienti našli postup, jímž lze dobývat zlato obsažené v mořské vodě, následkem toho vládnou prostředky téměř neomezenými, mohou vám váš svět dobře, ano přímo skvěle zaplatit. Počítejte s tím, že pro ně během doby bude cena světa klesat, zvlášť nastanou-li, jak lze předvídat, další vulkanické nebo tektonické katastrofy, daleko rozsáhlejší než ty, jichž jsme dosud byli svědky, a zmenší-li se jimi do velké míry plošná výměra kontinentů. Dnes ještě je možno prodat svět v celém dosavadním rozsahu, až z něho zůstanou nad hladinou moře jenom trosky hor, nedá vám za ně nikdo ani vindry. Jsem zde sice jako zástupce a právní poradce Mloků, volal dr. Carvalho, a musím hájit jejich zájmy, ale jsem člověk jako vy, pánové, a prospěch lidí mně leží na srdci neméně než vám. Proto vám radím, ne, zapřísahám vás: prodávejte pevniny, pokud není pozdě! Můžete je prodat v celku nebo rozprodávat po jednotlivých zemích. Chief Salamander, jehož velkodušné a moderní myšlení je dnes už každému známo, se zavazuje, že při budoucích nutných změnách zemského povrchu bude pokud možno šetřit lidských životů, zaplavení pevnin se bude dít postupně a tak, aby nedošlo k panice nebo zbytečným katastrofám. Jsme zmocněni zahájit jednání ať už se slavnou světovou konferencí jako celkem, nebo s jednotlivými státy. Přítomnost tak vynikajících právníků, jako je profesor van Dott nebo maitre Julien Rosso Castelli, vám může být zárukou, že vedle spravedlivých zájmů našich klientů Mloků budeme ruku v ruce s vámi hájit to, co je nám všem nejdražší: lidskou kulturu a dobro celého člověčenstva.","Dr. Manoel Carvalho, a great Lisbon lawyer, thanked the Newt government for this offer, but every child will understand, saying that building new land is far more time-consuming and costly than demolishing old lands. Our clients need new shores and bays in the shortest time, this is a matter of being and not being for them. It would be better for humanity to accept the jealous offer of Chief Salamander, who today is still willing to buy the world from people instead of seizing it by force. Our clients have found a way to mine the gold contained in seawater, as a result of which they rule almost indefinitely, they can pay your world well, yes, great. Expect the price of the world to fall for them over time, especially if, as can be predicted, further volcanic or tectonic catastrophes occur far greater than those we have seen so far, and if they reduce the area to a large extent acreage of continents. Today, it is still possible to sell the world in its entirety, until only the ruins of the mountains remain above sea level, no one will give you a bunch. Although I am here as a representative and legal advisor to the Newts, Dr. Carvalho, and I must defend their interests, but I am a man like you, gentlemen, and the good of the people is at my heart no less than yours. That's why I advise you, no, I swear to you: sell the mainland if it's not too late! You can sell them as a whole or sell them by country. Chief Salamander, whose generous and modern thinking is now familiar to everyone, is committed to saving lives as much as possible in future changes to the earth's surface, flooding the land gradually and avoiding panic or unnecessary disasters. We are empowered to start negotiations either with the famous world conference as a whole or with individual states. The presence of such outstanding lawyers as Professor van Dott or Maitre Julien Rosso Castelli can guarantee that, in addition to the fair interests of our Newt clients, we will go hand in hand with you to defend what is most dear to us all: human culture and the good of all humanity.","MANOEL CARVALHO, renowned lawyer from Lisbon, offered his thanks for this proposal which he would convey to the newts; but any child could understand, he said, that building new land would take much longer and cost far more than demolishing old land. Our clients are in need of new bays and shorelines as soon as possible; it is for them a matter of life and death. It would be better for mankind to accept Chief Salamander's generous offer of buying the world from the human beings instead of taking it by force. Our clients have found a way of extracting the gold contained in seawater; so that they have almost unlimited means; they would be able to pay for your world very well, very well indeed. You would do well to bear in mind that, from their point of view, the price of the world will become lower with time, especially if—as might well be expected—any further volcanic or tectonic disasters take place which might well be far larger than anything we have been witness to so far, and these might well substantially reduce the size of the continents. Today you still have the opportunity to sell the world while it is still its present size; when there is nothing left above water but the ruins of a few mountains no-one will want to pay you a penny for it. I am here as representative and legal advisor for the newts, and it is my duty to defend their interests; but I am also a human being just like yourselves, gentlemen, and the well-being of mankind is just as close to my heart as it is to yours. This is why I advise you, indeed I implore you: Sell the continents before it is too late! You can sell them as a whole or sell them country by country. Everyone now is aware of Chief Salamander's generosity and modernity; he gives his assurance that in the course of these unavoidable changes to be made to the surface of the Earth everything possible will be done to protect human life; the continents will be flooded in stages and in a way that will avoid any panic or unnecessary catastrophe. We have been authorised to negotiate either with the this illustrious world conference as a whole or with individual states. The presence of such outstanding lawyers such as Professor van Dott and MaÃ®tre Julien Rosso Castelli is your assurance that we are concerned not only to defend the legitimate interests of our clients but will also co-operate closely with yourselves to protect those things that are dearest to us all; human culture and the good of all mankind.","Dr Manoel Carvalho, the great Lisbon lawyer, expressed his thanks for this offer which he would convey to the Newt government. But any child would understand that the construction of new continents was far more laborious and costly than demolishing existing land. His clients needed new coasts and bays within the shortest possible time; to them this was a matter of life and death. Mankind would be wise to accept the generous offer of the Chief Salamander who, at this moment, was still willing to purchase the world from mankind rather than seize it by force. His clients had discovered a process for extracting the gold contained in sea-water; in consequence they had available to them virtually unlimited financial means; they were in a position to offer a good, indeed an excellent, price for the human world. You may be sure, he continued, that in the course of time the value of the world will decline, especially if, as might be expected, further volcanic or tectonic disasters were to occur, far more extensive than the ones we have so far witnessed; as a result of them, moreover, the surface of the continents was being diminished. Today the world may still be sold with its full present dimensions; once only the ruins of mountains remain above the water’s surface, no one is going to give you a brass farthing for it! ‘ True, I stand here as the representative and legal adviser of the Newts,’ Dr Carvalho exclaimed, ‘and I must protect their interests: but I am a man like you, gentlemen, and the good of the human race is as close to my heart as it is to yours. That is why I advise you, nay , implore you: sell your continents while there is time! You may sell them in their entirety or in lots of individual countries. The Chief Salamander, whose magnanimous and modern thinking is by now universally known, undertakes that in all future necessary alterations to the earth’s surface he will, as far as possible, spare human life; flooding will be conducted in easy stages and in such a way that no panic or unnecessary catastrophes are created. We are empowered to embark on negotiations, either with this revered world conference as a whole or with individual countries. The presence of such outstanding lawyers as Professor Van Dott or Maître Julien Rosso Castelli should be a guarantee to you that, alongside the just interests of our clients, the Newts, we shall, hand in hand with you, defend what is most dear to all of us: human culture and the good of mankind as a whole.’"

We were discussing the province of Fung-tien. We have been authorised to offer the Japanese government compensation for it in the form of gold. The question following on from that is what our clients would receive from the states concerned for the task of evacuating China.”","Professor Van Dott fidgeted impatiently and raised his hand. ‘ Mr Chairman, perhaps we could return to the matter under discussion. We are talking about Föng-tien province. We are authorised to offer the Japanese government compensation for it in gold. There is also the question of how much the states with an interest in this matter would pay our clients for removing China altogether.’"
"Kapitán J. van Toch pokračoval v křížovém výslechu s nemalou trpělivostí a důkladností. Ano, jsou tam čerti. Kolik? Tisíce a tisíce. Jsou velcí asi jako desetileté dítě, pane, a skoro černí. Plovou ve vodě a na dně chodí po dvou. Po dvou, sáhib, jako vy nebo já, ale přitom kývají tělem, tak tak, pořád tak tak... Ano, pane, mají také ruce, jako lidé, ne, nemají žádné drápy, spíš je to jako dětské ruce. Ne, sáhib, nemají rohy ani chlupy. Ano, ocas mají, trochu jako ryba, ale bez ocasní ploutve. A velikou hlavu, kulatou jako Batakové. Ne, neříkali nic, pane, jenom to bylo, jako by mlaskali. Když Sinhálec odřezával mušle v hloubce asi šestnácti metrů, pocítil na zádech dotek jako malých studených prstů. Ohlédl se, a bylo jich kolem sta a sta. Sta a sta, pane, plovoucích i stojících na kamenech, a všichni se dívali, co tam Sinhálec dělá. Tu upustil nůž i škeble a snažil se vyplout nahoru. Přitom narazil na několik čertů, kteří pluli nad ním, a co bylo potom, to už neví, pane.","Captain J. van Toch continued the cross-examination with considerable patience and thoroughness. Yes, there are devils. Pin? Thousands and thousands. They're about the age of ten, sir, and almost black. They float in the water and walk in pairs at the bottom. Two at a time, sahib, like you or me, but they sway the body, so, still, so ... Yes, sir, they also have hands, like people, no, they have no claws, it's more like children's hands. No, sahib, they don't have horns or hair. Yes, they have a tail, a bit like a fish, but without a tail fin. And a big head, round like the Bataks. No, they didn't say anything, sir, it was just like they were clapping. As Sinhalese cut the shells to a depth of about sixteen meters, he felt a touch on his back like little cold fingers. He looked back, and there were about a hundred and a hundred. One hundred and a hundred, sir, floating and standing on the rocks, and everyone was watching what Sinhalese was doing there. He dropped the knife and the clams and tried to go upstairs. As he did so, he came across several devils sailing over him, and he doesn't know what happened next, sir.","With a great deal of patience and thoroughness, Captain J. van Toch went on with the cross questioning. Yes, there were demons down there. How many? Thousands and thousands. About the size of a ten year old child, Captain, and almost black. They swim in the water, and on the bottom they walk on two legs. Two legs, Saheb, just like you or me, but always swaying from side to side, like this, like this, like this... Yes Captain, they have hands too, just like people; no, they don't have claws, they're more like a child's hands. No, Saheb, they don't have horns or fur. Yes, they have a tail, a little like a fish's tail but without the fins. And a big head, round like a Bataks. No, they don't say anything, Captain, only a sort of squelch. When the Sinhalese had been cutting an oyster off, about sixteen metres down, he felt something like little cold fingers touch his back. He had looked round and there were hundreds and hundreds of them all around him. Hundreds and hundreds, Captain, swimming around and standing on stones and all of them were watching what the Sinhalese was doing. So he dropped the knife and the oyster and tried to swim up to the surface. Then he struck against some of the demons who had been swimming after him, and what happened next he did not know.","Captain van Toch continued his cross-examination with a great deal of patience and thoroughness. OK, so there are devils there. How many? Thousands and thousands. They’re about as tall as a child of ten, sir, and nearly black. They swim in the water and on the sea-bed they walk upright. Upright, sir, just like you and me, but they sway their bodies the while: like this, and like this, all the time … Yes, sir, they’ve got hands too, just like human beings; no, they’ve got no claws, more like the hands of children. No, sir, they haven’t got any horns or any hair. Yes, they’ve got a tail, a bit like a fish but without a tail-fin. And a big head, a round head like the Bataks. No, sir, they didn’t say anything; they only seemed to smack their lips. As the Singhalese was cutting off some shells at a depth of about fifty feet he had felt something touching his back - like small cold fingers. He’d turned round, and there were hundreds and hundreds of them all round him. Hundreds and hundreds, sir, swimming or standing on rocks, and all of them watching what the Singhalese was doing there. That was when he’d dropped his knife and the shells and had tried to swim to the surface. In doing so he’d collided with some of the devils who were swimming above him, and what happened next he didn’t know, sir."
"Kdyby aspoň ti Salamandři nebyli tak strašlivě průměrní, vyhrkl X jaksi stísněně. Ano, jsou jakžtakž vzdělaní, ale tím jsou ještě omezenější, neboť si osvojili z lidské civilizace jen to, co v ní je průměrné a užitkové, mechanické a opakovatelné. Stojí po boku lidstva jako fámulus Wagner po boku Faustově, učí se z týchž knih jako lidský Faust, jenom s tím rozdílem, že jim to stačí a že v nich nehlodá žádná pochybnost. To nejhroznější je, že rozmnožili ten učelivý, hlupácký a sufizantní typ civilizované mediokrity ve velkém, v miliónech a miliardách stejných kusů, nebo ne, mýlím se: to nejhroznější je, že mají takový úspěch. Naučili se užívat strojů a čísel, a ukázalo se, že to stačí, aby se stali pány svého světa. Vynechali z lidské civilizace všechno, co v ní bylo neúčelné, hravé, fantastické nebo starobylé, tím z ní vypustili, co v ní bylo lidského, a převzali jenom její holou praktickou, technickou a utilitární stránku. A tato žalostná karikatura lidské civilizace se má ohromně k světu, buduje technické divy, renovuje naši starou planetu a nakonec počíná fascinovat samo lidstvo. U svého žáka a sluhy se bude Faust učit tajemství úspěchu a prostřednosti. Buď se lidstvo s Mloky utká v dějinném konfliktu na život a na smrt, nebo se neodvratně posalamandří. Co mne se týče, uzavíral X melancholicky, viděl bych raději to prvé.","If only the Salamanders weren't so terribly average, X blurted out. Yes, they are somehow educated, but they are even more limited because they have mastered from human civilization only what is average and useful, mechanical and repeatable. He stands by the side of humanity like a fagulus Wagner by the side of Faust, learning from the same books as the human Faust, with the only difference being that it is enough for them and that there is no doubt in them. The worst thing is that they have multiplied the instructive, stupid and suffocating type of civilized mediocrity in large, in millions and billions of equal pieces, or not, I am wrong: the most terrible thing is that they have such success. They learned to use machines and numbers, and it turned out that it was enough for them to become masters of their world. They left out of human civilization everything that was useless, playful, fantastic, or ancient, thus omitting what was human in it, and taking over only its bare practical, technical, and utilitarian side. And this pathetic caricature of human civilization is coming to the world tremendously, building technical wonders, renovating our old planet, and ultimately fascinating humanity itself. Faust will learn the secrets of success and mediocrity from his disciple and servant. Either humanity will face the Newts in a historical conflict for life and death, or it will inevitably become a mandala. As for me, X concluded melancholy, I'd rather see the first one.","If only these salamanders were not so horribly mediocre, exclaimed X in his anxiety. It is true that they are, to some extent, educated, but this has the effect of limiting them further as all that they have taken from human civilisation is that which is the most commonplace and useful, things that are mechanical and repeatable. They stand at the side of man like Wagner at the side of Faust; they learn from these books like the human Faust but with this difference, that this is all they want and suffer from no doubts or questions. The most horrifying thing is that this type of civilised mediocrity, educable but dull and complacent, exists on such a large scale; millions and thousands of millions of individuals all the same; or rather, perhaps I am mistaken, and the most horrifying thing of all is that they have been so successful. They have taught themselves to use machines and numbers, and they have shown that that is all that is needed to become masters of the world. All parts of human civilisation that are without purpose, that are playful, fantastic or antiquated, they have ignored; in this way they have ignored all that makes man human, adopting only that which is purely practical, technical and utilisable. And this pitiful caricature of human civilisation has achieved awesome things; it builds wonders of technology, renovates our old planet and is even a source of fascination of people themselves. From Wagner, his apprentice and servant, Faust learned the secret of success and of mediocrity. Mankind has either to engage in an epoch-making conflict of life and death with the newts or he will become like the newts, never to regain his humanness. As far as I am concerned, X concluded sadly, I would rather see the former.","If only those salamanders weren’t so terribly mediocre, X rather unhappily blurted out. Yes, they are more or less educated - but that makes them even more blinkered because they have acquired from human civilisation only that which is mediocre and utilitarian in it, mechanical and repeatable. They stand beside mankind as the famulus Wagner stands beside Faustus: their learning comes from the same books as that of the human Faustuses but with the difference that to them they are sufficient and that they are not gnawed by any doubt. The most terrible thing is that they have multiplied that half-educated, brainless and smug type of civilised mediocrity on a vast scale, in millions and billions of identical specimens. But no, I am wrong: the most terrible thing is that they are so successful. They have learned how to use machines and numbers, and it became obvious that that was enough for them to become masters of their world. They have omitted from human civilisation everything that was aimless, playful, fantastic or ancient; as a result they have omitted everything that was human in it and adopted solely its practical, technical and utilitarian side. And that pitiful caricature of human civilisation is doing splendidly: it is building technological miracles, renewing our ancient planet, and eventually fascinating mankind itself. From his disciple and servant Faustus will learn the secret of success and of mediocrity. Either mankind will face up to the Newts in a history-making life-and-death conflict or it will be irrevocably salamandrised. For my part, X concluded sadly, I would rather see the former."
"Kapitán ožil. ""To tě chválím, pane Bondy, sir. Lodě jsou teď hrozně laciny, možeš jich koupit plné přístav -"" Kapitán van Toch se pustil do technického výkladu, kde a zač jsou na prodej jaké vessels a boats a tank-steamers, G. H. Bondy ho neposlouchal a jen ho pozoroval, G. H. Bondy se vyznal v lidech. Ani na okamžik nebral vážně ještěrky kapitána van Tocha, ale kapitán mu stál za úvahu. Poctivý, ano. A zná tam dole poměry. Blázen, ovšem. Ale zatraceně sympatický. V srdci G. H. Bondyho zazněla jakási fantastická struna. Lodě s perlami a kávou, lodě s kořením a všemi vůněmi Arábie. G. H. Bondy měl roztržitý pocit, který se u něho obyčejně dostavoval před každým velikým a úspěšným rozhodnutím, pocit, který by se dal vyjádřit slovy: Nevím sice proč, ale asi se do toho dám. Zatím Captain van Toch rýsoval mohutnými prackami ve vzduchu lodi s awning-decks nebo quarter-decks, báječny lodi, chlapče -","The captain came to life. ""I commend you, Mr. Bondy, sir. Ships are very cheap now, you can buy them in full port—"" Captain van Toch set out on a technical explanation of where and what vessels and tank-steamers are for sale, G. H. Bondy him he didn't listen and just watched him, G. H. Bondy knew people. He didn't take Captain van Toch's lizards seriously for a moment, but the captain was worth considering. Honest, yes. And he knows the conditions down there. Crazy, of course. But damn sympathetic. There was a fantastic string in G. H. Bondy's heart. Ships with pearls and coffee, ships with spices and all the scents of Arabia. Mr. Bondy had a distracted feeling that usually came to him before any big and successful decision, a feeling that could be expressed in words: I don't know why, but I guess I'll get into it. Meanwhile, Captain van Toch was drawing massive paws in the air of a ship with awning-decks or quarter-decks, a fabulous ship, boy -","The captain became more lively. “That's very wise of you, Mister Bondy. Ships are very cheap right now, you could buy a whole harbour full of them...” The captain launched into a deep and technical explanation of what vessels are for sale where and at what prices and boats and tank-steamers; G.H. Bondy did not listen to him but merely watched; G.H. Bondy was a good judge of character. He had not taken Captain van Toch's story about the lizards seriously for one moment; but the captain himself was somebody worth taking seriously. Honest , yes. And he knew his way around down there. Mad, obviously. But very likeable. All this struck a chord in G.H. Bondy's heart and chimed with his love of fantasy. Ships carrying pearls and coffee, ships with spices and all the scents of Arabia. There was a particular, indescribable feeling that G.H. Bondy had before each major and successful decision he made; a sensation which might have been expressed in words thus: It's true I don't really know why, but I think I'll go along with this. He had this feeling now. Meanwhile Captain van Toch was waving his enormous hands in the air to outline ships with awning decks or quarter decks, fantastic ships, lad ...","The captain revived. ‘I like that idea, Mr Bondy, sir. Ships are terribly cheap just now, you can buy a whole harbour full of them - ‘ Captain van Toch launched out on a technical exposition on where and at what price certain vessels and boats and tank steamers were on sale. G. H. Bondy was not listening but was merely studying him: G. H. Bondy was a judge of men. He did not for one moment take Captain van Toch’s lizards seriously, but he thought the captain was worth considering. Honest, yes. And he knew conditions out there. He was mad, of course. But damned likable. In G. H. Bondy’s heart some fantastic chord was touched. Ships carrying pearls and coffee, ships with spices and all the perfumes of Arabia, G. H. Bondy felt distracted - a sensation which seized him before every major and successful decision, a sensation that might be put into words like this: I don’t know why, but I’ll probably go for it. Captain van Toch’s massive hands were meanwhile mapping out in the air some ships with awning-decks or quarter-decks, superb ships, old boy -"
"Zrovna v té době se stala krajně nepříjemná věc: v okolí Coutances napadli vesničtí hoši Mloka, který se prý podezřele kradl k slepičímu kurníku, obklíčili ho, přitištěného zády ke zdi stodoly, a jali se ho kamenovat cihlami. Raněný Salamandr se rozpřáhl rukou a hodil na zem něco podobného vajíčku: nastal výbuch, jímž byl na kusy roztrhán Mlok, ale také tři chlapci: jedenáctiletý Pierre Cajus, šestnáctiletý Marcel Bérard a patnáctiletý Louis Kermadec, mimoto pět dětí bylo víceméně těžce zraněno. Zpráva o tom se rozletěla po celém kraji, asi sedm set lidí se sjelo autobusy z široka daleka a napadli mločí osadu v zálivu Basse Coutances, ozbrojeni puškami, vidlemi a cepy. Nějakých dvacet Mloků bylo zabito, než se četníkům podařilo zatlačit rozzuřený dav. Přivolaní zákopníci z Cherbourgu obklopili zátoku Basse Coutances hradbou z ostnatého drátu, ale v noci vystoupili Salamandři z moře, ručními granáty roztrhali drátěné překážky a chystali se patrně vniknout do vnitrozemí. Vojenské kamióny přivezly narychlo několik kumpanií pěchoty s kulomety a řetěz vojska se snažil oddělit Mloky od lidí. Zatím sedláci vybíjeli berní úřady a četnické stanice a jeden neoblíbený berní exekutor byl pověšen na lucernu s tabulkou: Pryč s Mloky! Noviny, zejména německé, psaly o revoluci v Normandii, pařížská vláda však zakročila energickým dementi.","It was at that time that an extremely unpleasant thing happened: in the vicinity of Coutances, the village boys attacked Newt, who allegedly crept suspiciously to the chicken coop, surrounded him, pressed against his back to the barn wall, and began to stone him with bricks. The wounded Salamander spread his arm and threw something like an egg on the ground: there was an explosion that tore Newt to pieces, but also three boys: eleven-year-old Pierre Cajus, 16-year-old Marcel Bérard and 15-year-old Louis Kermadec, and five children were more or less seriously injured. The news spread throughout the region, about seven hundred people took buses from far and wide and attacked the newt settlement in Basse Coutances, armed with rifles, pitchforks and spikes. Some twenty Newts were killed before the gendarmes managed to push the angry crowd. The summoned pioneers of Cherbourg surrounded the bay of Basse Coutances with a barbed wire wall, but at night the Salamanders emerged from the sea, tore through the wire barriers with hand grenades, and apparently were about to enter the interior. Military trucks hastily brought several infantry companies with machine guns, and a chain of troops tried to separate the Newts from the humans. Meanwhile, the peasants were plundering tax offices and gendarmerie stations, and one unpopular tax executor was hung on a lantern with a sign: Gone with the Newts! Newspapers, especially German ones, wrote about the Normandy revolution, but the Paris government intervened with vigorous denials.","It was just about at this time that there was a very unpleasant incident near Coutances: a group of local lads attacked a newt who, they claimed, had been acting suspiciously near a hen coop. They surrounded him with his back against the wall of a barn and began to throw bricks at him. The injured salamander raised his hand and threw down something that looked like an egg; there was an explosion which ripped not only the newt to pieces but also three of the lads: eleven year old Pierre Cajus, sixteen year old Marcel BÃ©rard and fifteen year old Louis Kermadec; and there were also five other children seriously injured to varying degrees. The news quickly spread throughout the region; about seven hundred people came in buses from all around and attacked the newt colony in the bay of Basse Coutances, armed with shotguns, pitchforks and flails. Around twenty newts were killed before the police were able to subdue the angry crowd. Sappers called in from Cherbourg surrounded the bay with barbed wire; but that night the salamanders came out of the sea, destroyed the barbed wire fences with hand grenades and tried to make their way inland. Several companies of soldiers with machine guns were quickly brought in on lorries and a chain of troops was used to try and keep the newts separate from people. Meanwhile, the people were attacking the finance offices and police stations and one unpopular tax inspector was hanged on a lamppost with a placard saying: Away with the Newts! The newspapers, especially those in Germany, talked about a revolution in Normandy; although the government in Paris issued vehement denials.","At about that time an exceedingly disagreeable thing happened: in the neighbourhood of Coutance some village youths attacked a Newt who, so they said, was suspiciously creeping up to a chicken-coop; they surrounded him, forced him with his back to the barn wall and began to pelt him with bricks. The wounded salamander swung his arm up and flung on the ground something that resembled an egg; there was an explosion which blew the Newt to pieces, as well as the three boys: eleven-year-old Pierre Cajus, sixteen-year-old Marcel Berard and fifteen-year-old Louis Kermadec. Another five children were more or less seriously injured. News of the event spread rapidly throughout the region; some seven hundred people came flocking together by bus from far and wide and, armed with shotguns, pitchforks and flails, attacked a Newt colony in the bay of Basse Coutance. About twenty Newts were killed before the gendarmes succeeded in forcing back the infuriated crowd. Sappers summoned from Cherbourg surrounded the bay of Basse Coutance with a barbed wire fence. At night, however, the salamanders emerged from the sea, breached the wire fence with hand-grenades and were evidently about to penetrate inland. Army trucks rushed up a few platoons of infantry armed with machine-guns, and a military cordon was thrown between the Newts and the humans. The farmers, meanwhile, were smashing up local tax offices and police stations and one unpopular tax collector was strung up on a lamp-post with a placard: Down with Newts! The newspapers, especially the German newspapers, spoke of a revolution in Normandy; the government in Paris, however, issued an emphatic denial."
"""Byl už tehdy takový blázen?""","""Was he such a fool then?""",“Was he already such a lunatic in dem days?”,‘Was he potty in your time too?’
"Zatím už vyjížděly hasičské vozy, ambulance a pomocné vlaky směrem Morgan City - Patterson - Franklin. Po čtvrté hodině ranní došla první přesnější zpráva: Trať mezi Franklinem a New Iberií, sedm kilometrů na západ od Franklinu, přerušena vodou, zdá se, že tam vznikla zemětřesením hluboká trhlina, spojená s Vermillion Bay a zaplavená mořem. Pokud zatím možno zjistit, postupuje tato trhlina od Vermillion Bay směrem východoseverovýchodním, blízko Franklinu se ohýbá na sever, ústí do Grand Lake, načež se táhne dále k severu až po linii Plaquemine - Lafayette, kde se končí ve starém jezírku, druhá větev trhliny spojuje Grand Lake na západ s jezerem Napoleonvillským. Celková délka propadliny je asi osmdesát kilometrů, šířka dva až jedenáct kilometrů. Zde bylo, zdá se, středisko zemětřesení. Možno mluvit o úžasné náhodě, že se tato trhlina vyhnula všem větším obcím. Nicméně ztráty na životech jsou asi značné. Ve Franklinu napršelo 60 cm bahna, v Pattersonu 45 cm. Lidé z Atchafalaya Bay vypravují, že při otřesu ustoupilo moře asi o tři kilometry, načež se vrhlo zpět na břeh vlnou třicet metrů vysokou. Jsou obavy, že na břehu zahynulo mnoho lidí. S New Iberií stále ještě není spojení.","Meanwhile, fire trucks, ambulances and auxiliary trains were leaving in the direction of Morgan City - Patterson - Franklin. At four o'clock in the morning, the first more accurate report came: The line between Franklin and New Iberia, seven kilometers west of Franklin, interrupted by water, there seems to be a deep earthquake that connected Vermillion Bay and flooded the sea. As far as can be seen, this rift extends east-northeast from Vermillion Bay, bends north near Franklin, empties into Grand Lake, and then extends further north to the Plaquemine-Lafayette line, where it ends at the old lake, the second branch of the rift connecting Grand Lake to the west with Lake Napoleonville. The total length of the depression is about eighty kilometers, width two to eleven kilometers. Here seemed to be the center of the earthquake. One can speak of a wonderful coincidence that this rift avoided all major communities. However, the loss of life is probably considerable. In Franklin it rained 60 cm of mud, in Patterson 45 cm. The people of Atchafalaya Bay say that during the earthquake, the sea receded about three kilometers, after which it fell back to shore with a wave thirty meters high. There are fears that many people have died on the coast. There is still no connection with New Iberia.","By now fire engines, ambulances and trainfuls of helpers and supplies were on their way to Morgan city—Patterson—Franklin. It was not until after four in the morning that the first accurate news arrived: Railroad closed by floods between Franklin and New Iberia, five miles west of Franklin; seems deep fissure opened by earthquake, connects with Vermillion Bay and flooded with seawater. As far as ascertained, fissure extends from Vermillion Bay east-northeast, near Franklin turns northwards, opens into Grand Lake, continues northwards until line Plaquemine—Lafayette, ending in former lake; second branch fissure connects Grand Lake westwards with Napoleonville Lake. Fissure around fifty miles total length, width one to seven miles. Epicenter apparently here. Seems amazing luck fissure missed all major towns. Loss of life nonetheless substantial. In Franklin twenty-four inches rain of mud, in Patterson eighteen inches. Reports from Atchafalaya Bay, sea retreated two miles at time of earthquake, then hundred foot tidal wave. Feared many dead on coast. Still no communication with New Iberia.","By then fire trucks, ambulances and rescue trains were on their way to Morgan City - Patterson - Franklin. After 4 a.m. came the first detailed report: Track between Franklin and New Iberia, seven kilometres west of Franklin, cut by water; appears that earthquake opened up deep fissure running into Vermilion Bay which has become flooded by sea. As far as has been possible to establish so far, the fissure runs from Vermilion Bay in an east-north-easterly direction, near Franklin it turns north, running into Grand Lake, extending thence further north to a line Plaquemine-Lafayette, where it ends in a small ancient lake; a second arm of the fissure connects Grand Lake to the west with Lake Napoleonville. Total length of subsidence about eighty kilometres, width two to eleven kilometres. Epicentre of earthquake was evidently here. By amazing good fortune fissure avoided all major settlements. Even so, loss of life considerable. In Franklin sixty centimetres of mud rained down, in Patterson forty-five centimetres. People from Atchafalaya Bay state that during tremor sea receded by about three kilometres, thereupon came hurtling back towards shore with wave thirty metres high. Fears that many people killed on shore. Still no contact with New Iberia."
"Jak jsme už řekli, sbírka pana Povondry uchovala mnoho dějinného materiálu o celé té historii s Mloky, tím není ovšem řečeno, že by mohla uspokojit vědeckého dějepisce. Předně pan Povondra, jemuž se nedostalo odborného vzdělání v pomocných vědách historických a v archiválních metodách, nepřipojil k svým výstřižkům ani udání pramene, ani příslušný letopočet, takže většinou nevíme, kdy a kde ten který dokument vyšel. Za druhé při nadbytku materiálu, který se mu kupil pod rukama, schovával pan Povondra hlavně dlouhé články, jež považoval za důležitější, kdežto stručné zprávy a depeše jednoduše odhazoval do uhláku, následkem toho se nám uchovalo o celém tom období neobyčejně málo zpráv a faktů. Za třetí do věci zasáhla vydatně ruka paní Povondrové, když se krabice pana Povondry povážlivě plnily, vytahovala tiše a potají část výstřižků a spálila je, což se opakovalo několikrát ročně. Ušetřila jenom těch, kterých tolik nepřibývalo, jako byly výstřižky tištěné písmem malabarským, tibetským nebo koptickým, ty zůstaly uloženy téměř kompletně, ale pro jisté mezery v našem vzdělání nám nejsou mnoho platny. Materiál, který máme po ruce k dějinám Mloků, je tedy podstatně kusý, asi jako pozemkové knihy z osmého století po Kristu nebo jako sebrané spisy básnířky Sapfó, jenom nahodile se nám dochovala dokumentace o tom nebo onom úseku toho velikého světového dění, které se přes všechny mezery pokusíme shrnout pod názvem Po stupních civilizace.","As we have already said, Mr. Povondra's collection has preserved a lot of historical material about the whole history with Newts, but this does not mean that it could satisfy a scientific historian. First of all, Mr. Povondra, who did not receive a professional education in auxiliary historical sciences and archival methods, did not attach to his clippings either the source or the relevant year, so we usually do not know when and where the document was published. Secondly, with the abundance of material he had bought under his hands, Mr Povondra mainly hid long articles, which he considered more important, while he simply threw brief messages and traps into the charcoal, as a result of which we kept extraordinarily little news and facts about the whole period. Thirdly, Mrs. Povondr's hand intervened when Mr. Povondra's boxes were filled considerably, quietly pulling out some of the clippings and burning them, which was repeated several times a year. She saved only those that did not increase as much, such as Malabar, Tibetan, or Coptic scriptures, which remained almost completely, but they are not very valid for certain gaps in our education. The material we have on the history of Newts is therefore quite fragmentary, like land books from the eighth century AD or the collected writings of the poetess Sappho, only randomly preserved documentation of this or that part of the great world events, which we will try to summarize all the gaps under the title In stages of civilization.","As we have already said, Mister Povondra's collection saved much historic material concerning the whole story of the newts; but that, of course, does not mean to say it was enough to satisfy a scientific historian. Firstly, Mister Povondra had never received a specialist education as assistant in historic or archival methods, and he made no indication on his cuttings of the source, or the date, so that we do not know when or where each document was published. And secondly, faced with so much material piling up around him, Mister Povondra kept mainly the longest articles which he considered must be the most important, while the shorter reports were simply thrown into the coal scuttle; as a result, through all this period, remarkable few facts and reports were conserved by him. Thirdly, the hand of Mrs. Povondra played a considerable part in the matter; when she carefully filled up one of Mister Povondra's boxes she would quietly and secretly pull out some of the cuttings and burn them, which took place several times a year. The only ones she spared were the ones that did not grow in number very fast, such as the cuttings printed in the Malabar, Tibetan or Coptic scripts; these remained more or less complete, although for certain gaps in our body of knowledge they are not of great value. This means that the material we have available concerning the history of the newts is very fragmented, like the land records of the eighth century A.D., or the selected writings of the poetess, Sappho; but some documents, here and there, did happen to survive about this phase of the great history of the world, and despite all the gaps we will do our best to summarise them under the title The Rise of Civilisation.","As we have said, Mr Povondra’s collection has preserved a great deal of historical material about the whole story of the Newts; which is not to say that it could possibly satisfy a scholarly historian. For one thing, Mr Povondra, who had not had the benefit of specialised education in the ancillary historical sciences or in archival methods, did not furnish his cuttings with either a source reference or the appropriate date, so that for the most part we do not know where and when a certain document was printed. For another thing, because of the surfeit of material accumulating under his hands, Mr Povondra kept mainly the longer articles, considering them to be more important, while brief reports and journalist’s cables he simply threw in the coal scuttle. As a result, an exceedingly small amount of reports and facts has come down to us about that entire period. Thirdly, there was a good deal of intervention on the part of Mrs Povondra: whenever Mr Povondra’s boxes began to fill alarmingly she would quietly and surreptitiously extract some of the cuttings and burn them; this would happen several times a year. She would keep only those which did not accumulate too quickly, such as the cuttings printed in Malabar, Tibetan or Coptic script; these have come down to us almost in their entirety, but in view of certain gaps in our education they are not a lot of use to us. Hence the material available to us on the history of the Newts is essentially incomplete, rather like land registers from the eighth century AD or the collected works of the poetess Sappho; only by accident have the documents relating to one aspect or another of this great historic event been preserved for us. Yet in spite of all lacunae we shall attempt to map it out under the heading ‘Up the Ladder of Civilisation’."
"Otázka výchovy a jazyka byla ovšem jenom jednou stránkou velikého Mločího Problému, který tak říkajíc rostl lidem pod rukama, Tak například záhy se vynořila otázka, jak se má vlastně s Mloky nakládat v ohledu, abychom tak řekli, spíše společenském. V prvních, téměř předhistorických letech Mločího Věku to byly ovšem spolky pro ochranu zvířat, které se horlivě staraly o to, aby se s Mloky nezacházelo krutě a nelidsky, dík jejich vytrvalým zákrokům se podařilo, že téměř všude přihlížely úřady k tomu, aby vůči Mlokům byly dodržovány policejní a veterinářské předpisy platné pro jiný chovný dobytek. Také zásadní odpůrci vivisekce podepsali mnoho protestů a peticí, aby bylo zakázáno provádět na živých Mlocích vědecké experimenty, v řadě států byl takový zákon skutečně vydán. Avšak s rostoucí vzdělaností Salamandrů se víc a víc cítily rozpaky zahrnovat Mloky prosté pod ochranu zvířat, zdálo se to být z jakýchsi ne docela jasných důvodů poněkud nevhodné. Tehdy byla založena mezinárodní Liga pro Ochranu Mloků (Salamander Protecting League) pod protektorátem vévodkyně of Huddersfield. Tato liga, čítající přes dvě stě tisíc členů hlavně v Anglii, vykonala pro Salamandry značnou a chvalitebnou práci, zejména dosáhla toho, že pro ně byla na mořských březích zřizována zvláštní mločí hřiště, kde by, nerušeni zvědavými diváky, konali své ""meetingy a sportovní slavnosti"" (míněny byly asi tajné Měsíční tance), že se na všech školách (dokonce i na Oxfordské univerzitě) kladlo žákům na srdce, aby nekamenovali Mloky, že se do jisté míry dbalo toho, aby na mločích školách nebyli mladí pulci přetěžováni učivem, a konečně že mločí pracoviště a ubikace byly obehnány vysokým prkenným plotem, který chránil Mloky před různým obtěžováním a hlavně dostatečně odděloval svět Salamandrů od světa lidí.","The question of upbringing and language, however, was only one aspect of the great Newt's Problem, which, so to speak, grew in people's hands. In the first, almost prehistoric years of the Newt Age, however, it was the animal protection associations that eagerly took care to prevent the Newts from being treated cruelly and inhumanly. the police and veterinary regulations applicable to other breeding cattle were complied with. Major opponents of the vivisection have also signed many protests and petitions to ban living experiments on living Newts, and in many states such a law has actually been passed. However, with the growing education of the Salamanders, they felt more and more embarrassed to include Newts under animal protection, which seemed somewhat inappropriate for some not-so-clear reasons. At that time, the International Salamander Protecting League was founded under the Protectorate of the Duchess of Huddersfield. The league, numbering over two hundred thousand members, mainly in England, has done considerable and commendable work for the Salamanders, in particular by setting up a special salamander course on the shores where they would hold their ""meetings and sports"" without being disturbed by curious spectators. festivities ""(probably the secret Moon Dances were meant) that in all schools (even Oxford University) it was important for pupils not to stone the Newts, that to some extent care was taken not to overload young tadpoles with the curriculum, and finally that the salamander's quarters and quarters were surrounded by a high plank fence, which protected the Newts from various harassments and, most importantly, sufficiently separated the Salamander world from the human world.","Matters of education and language were, of course, only one aspect of the great newt problem which grew up, as it were, under people's feet. The question quickly arose, for instance, of how people were to behave towards the newts in, so to speak, the social sphere. At first, in the almost prehistoric period of the Newt Age, there were, of course, societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals which passionately ensured that the newts were not treated in ways that were cruel or inhumane; and it was thanks to their continuous efforts that government offices almost everywhere saw to it that the regulations set out by police and veterinary inspectors for the conditions of other livestock applied also to newts. Opponents of vivisection signed many protests and petitions calling for a ban on scientific experiments on live newts; and many countries did indeed pass laws to that effect. 18 But as the newts became more educated it became less clear whether newts should simply be included under animal protection legislation; for some reason, not entirely clear, it seemed rather inappropriate. And so the Salamander Protection League was founded under the patronage of the Duchess of Huddersfield. This league, numbering more than two hundred members, mostly in England, achieved many effective and praiseworthy improvements for the newts; in particular, they succeeded in establishing special newt playgrounds on the coast where, undisturbed by inquisitive human eyes, their meetings and sporting celebrations took place (by which they probably meant their secret dances once a month); they ensured that all places of education (even including the University of Oxford) persuaded their students not to throw stones at newts; to some extent they ensured that young tadpoles at school weren't over-burdened with work; and they even saw to it that places where newts lived or worked were surrounded by a high wooden fence that would protect them from various intrusions and, most importantly, would form an adequate barrier between the world of men and the world of newts. 19","The question of the Newts’ education and language was only one aspect of the general Newt problem, a problem that, as it were, grew under people’s hands. One question that emerged rather early on was how the Newts should be treated in, if one may so put it, social terms. In the early years, almost the prehistoric years, of the Newt Age it was chiefly Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that saw to it that the Newts were not cruelly or inhumanly treated; it is due to their efforts that police and veterinary regulations applicable to other farm animals were upheld with regard to the Newts. Conscientious objectors to vivisection also signed a lot of protests and petitions urging the banning of scientific experiments on live Newts. In a number of states such a law was in fact enacted.13 But with the rising educational level of the salamanders there was increasing embarrassment at simply bracketing the Newts with other animals; for some (not entirely clear) reasons this seemed rather inappropriate. It was then that an international League for the Protection of Salamanders was founded under the patronage of the Duchess of Huddersfield. This League, with over 200,000 members mainly in England, did important and praiseworthy work for the salamanders. Above all else it ensured that special Newt recreation areas were set up for them on sea coasts, where, undisturbed by curious spectators, they might hold their ‘meetings and sporting events’ (meaning presumably the secret Moon Dance); that students at all schools (and even at Oxford University) were enjoined not to throw stones at Newts; that measures were taken to ensure, up to a point, that young tadpoles were not overworked at school; and finally that Newt work camps and hutments were surrounded by tall wooden fences to protect the Newts against all kinds of molestation, but mainly to ensure that the world of the salamanders was sufficiently segregated from the human world.14"

"Tento učený bulletin by zajisté stačil, aby vědecky plně osvětlil otázku záhadných mořských netvorů, o které už bylo tolik řečí. Naneštěstí současně s ním vyšla zpráva holandského badatele van Hogenhoucka, který zařadil tyto krytožábré velemloky do čeledi mloků pravých neboli tritónů pode jménem Megatriton moluccanus a určil jejich rozšíření na holandsko -sundských ostrovech Džilolo, Morotai a Ceram, dále zpráva francouzského učence dr. Mignarda, který je určil jako typické salamandry, vykázal jim původní sídla na francouzských ostrovech Takaroa, Rangiroa a Raroia a nazval je zcela prostě Cryptobranchus salamandroides, dále zpráva H. W. Spence, který v nich rozpoznal novou čeleď Pelagidae, domorodou na ostrovech Gilbertových a schopnou nabýt odborné jsoucnosti pod druhovým jménem Pelagotriton Spencei. Mr Spenceovi se podařilo dopravit jeden živý exemplář až do londýnského zoo, zde se stal předmětem dalšího bádání, z něhož vyšel pod názvy Pelagobatrachus Hookeri, Salamandrops maritimus, Abranchus giganteus, Amphiuma gigas a mnohými jinými. Někteří učenci tvrdili, že Pelagotriton Speincei je totožný s Cryptobranchus Tinckeri a že Mignardův salamandr není nic jiného než Andrias Scheuchzeri, bylo z toho mnoho sporů o prioritu a o jiné čistě vědecké otázky. Tím se stalo, že nakonec přírodověda každého národa měla své vlastní velemloky a vědecky co nejzuřivěji potírala velemloky národů jiných. Proto také až do konce nebylo po vědecké stránce zjednáno v té celé veliké záležitosti s mloky dostatečně jasno.","This scholarly bulletin would certainly suffice to shed light on the question of the mysterious sea monsters that have been so much talked about. Unfortunately, a report by the Dutch researcher van Hogenhouck was published at the same time, which included these angiosperms in the family of salamanders or tritons under the name Megatriton moluccanus and determined their distribution in the Dutch-Sundanese islands of Jilolo, Morotai and Ceram, and a report by the French scholar Dr. Mignard, who identified them as typical salamanders, showed them their original settlements on the French islands of Takaroa, Rangiroa and Raroia and called them Cryptobranchus salamandroides, a report by H. W. Spence, who recognized the new family Pelagidae, native to the Gilbert Islands and able to acquire professional skills. under the generic name Pelagotriton Spencei. Mr Spence managed to transport one living specimen to the London Zoo, where he became the subject of further research, from which he came out under the names Pelagobatrachus Hookeri, Salamandrops maritimus, Abranchus giganteus, Amphiuma gigas and many others. Some scholars have argued that Pelagotriton Speincei is identical to Cryptobranchus Tinckeri and that Mignard's salamander is nothing more than Andrias Scheuchzeri, there have been many disputes over priority and other purely scientific issues. As a result, in the end, the science of each nation had its own giants and scientifically fought the giants of other nations as fiercely as possible. Therefore, even to the end, it was not scientifically agreed on the whole big matter with salamanders.","If the good Dr. Johannes Jakob Scheuchzer were alive today he would see the resurrection of his Adam of Ãhningen... This learned bulletin would certainly have been sufficient to satisfy scientific curiosity about the mysterious sea monsters that were being talked about so much. Unfortunately though, the Dutch researcher, van Hogenhouck, published a report at the same time in which he classified these covered-gilled giant newts in the order of proper newts or tritons under the name of megatriton molucccanus and established that they were distributed throughout the Dutch-Sundanese islands of Jilolo, Morotai and Ceram; there was also a report by the French scientist Dr. Mignard who saw them as typical salamanders and concluded that they had originated in the French islands of Takaroa, Rangiroa and Raroia, calling them simply cryptobranchus salamandroides; there was also a report from H.W. Spence in which he claimed to have recognised a new order of pelagidae, native to the Gilbert Isles, which could be classified under the species name of pelagotriton spencei. Mr. Spence succeeded in transporting a live specimen to London Zoo, where it became the subject of further research and was given the names pelagobatrachus hookeri, salamandrops maritimus, abranchus giganteus, amphiuma gigas and many others. Many scientists insisted that pelagotriton spencei was the same as cryptobranchus tinckeri or that Mignards salamander was no other than andrias scheuchzeri; there were many disputes about priority and other purely scientific questions. So it was that in the end every nation had its own giant newts and furiously and scientifically criticised the newts of other nations. That is why there never was any scientifically agreed opinion about the whole great matter of the newts.","Thanks to Mr J. S. Tincker the fossil lizard Hatterii is now joined by an antediluvian salamander. The good Dr Johannes Jakob Scheuchzer would now have witnessed the resurrection of his Oeningen Adam … This learned account should surely have been sufficient to illuminate scientifically the question of those mysterious marine monsters of which we have already spoken at length. Unfortunately, simultaneously with it, there appeared a report by the Dutch researcher van Hogenhouck, who classified these cryptobranchiate giant salamanders as belonging to the family of true salamanders or Tritons, naming them Megatriton moluccanus and establishing their occurrence on the Dutch Sunda Islands Dgilolo, Morotai and Ceram; there was also a report by the French scientist Dr Mignard, who classified them as typical salamanders, placed their original occurrence on the French islands of Takaroa, Rangiroa and Raroira, and named them quite simply Cryptobranchus salamandroides; then there was a report by H. W. Spence, who saw them as a new family, Pelagidae, native to the Gilbert Islands and capable of acquiring zoological existence under the generic name of Pelagotriton Spencei. Mr Spence succeeded in transporting a live specimen all the way to the London Zoo; there it became the object of further research, from which it emerged under the names of Pelagobatrachus Hookeri, Salamandrops maritimus, Abranchus giganteus, Amphiuma gigas, and a great number of others. Some scientists argued that Pelagotriton Spencei was identical with Cryptobranchus Tinckeri and that Mignard’s salamander was nothing other than Andrias Scheuchzeri; there was a lot of argument about priority and about other purely scientific questions. Thus it came about that eventually the natural history of every nation had its own giant salamanders and was waging a furious scientific war against the giant salamanders of other nations. As a result, that whole important business of the salamanders was never sufficiently resolved on the scientific side."

"Nyní se počal Mločím Problémem obírat i Mezinárodní úřad práce v Ženevě. Tam se střetly dva názory: jeden uznával Mloky za novou pracující třídu a domáhal se toho, aby na ně bylo rozšířeno veškeré sociální zákonodárství týkající se pracovní doby, placených dovolených, invalidního a starobního pojištění a tak dále, naproti tomu druhý názor hlásal, že v Mlocích roste nebezpečná konkurence lidským pracovním silám a že se má mločí práce jakožto protisociální jednoduše zakázat. Proti tomuto návrhu se ohradili nejen zástupci zaměstnavatelů, nýbrž i delegáti dělnictva, poukazujíce na to, že Mloci nejsou už jenom novou pracovní armádou, ale také velikým a stále důležitějším odběratelem. Jak uvedli, zvýšila se poslední dobou v míře dosud nebývalé zaměstnanost v oboru kovodělném (pracovní nářadí, stroje a kovové modly pro Mloky), zbrojařském, chemickém (podmořské třaskaviny), ve výrobě papíru (učebnice pro Mloky), cementu, dříví, umělých potravin (Salamander-Food) a mnohých jiných oborech, lodní tonáž stoupla proti dobám předmločím o 27%, těžba uhlí o 18,6%. Nepřímo, zvýšením zaměstnanosti a blahobytu u lidí, stoupá obrat i v jiných průmyslových odvětvích. Posléze v době nejposlednější objednávají Mloci různé strojové součásti podle svých vlastních nákresů, z nich si sami montují pod vodou pneumatické vrtačky, kladiva, podmořské motory, tiskařské stroje, vodní vysílačky a jiné mašiny vlastní konstrukce. Za ty součásti platí zvýšeným pracovním výkonem, dnes už pětina veškeré světové výroby v těžkém průmyslu i jemné mechanice je závislá na mločích objednávkách. Zrušte Salamandry, a můžete zavřít pětinu továren, místo dnešní prosperity budete mít milióny nezaměstnaných. Mezinárodní úřad práce nemohl ovšem nedbat těchto námitek, nakonec se po dlouhém jednání dosáhlo aspoň toho kompromisního řešení, že ""výše uvedení zaměstnanci skupiny S (obojživelnické) smějí být zaměstnáváni jenom pod vodou nebo ve vodě, na břehu pak jenom do vzdálenosti deseti metrů od čáry nejvyššího přílivu, že nesmějí těžit uhlí nebo naftu na dně mořském, že nesmějí pro suchozemský odběr vyrábět papír, textilie nebo umělé kůže z mořských řas"" a tak dále, tato omezení, uložená mločí výrobě, byla sestavena v kód o devatenácti odstavcích, jež blíže neuvádíme hlavně z toho důvodu, že se jich samozřejmě nikde nedbalo, ale jako velkorysé, vpravdě mezinárodní řešení Mločího Problému po stránce hospodářské a sociální byl uvedený kód záslužné a impozantní dílo.","Now the International Labor Office in Geneva has begun to deal with the Newt Problem. There were two views: one recognized the Newts as a new working class and demanded that all social legislation on working time, paid leave, disability and old-age insurance be extended to them, and so on, on the other hand, that the Newts are facing dangerous competition from the human workforce and the newt's work as an anti-social has simply been banned. Not only employers 'representatives but also workers' delegates objected to this proposal, pointing out that Newts were no longer just a new working army, but also a large and increasingly important customer. As they stated, employment has recently increased to an unprecedented level in the field of metalworking (work tools, machines and metal idols for salamanders), armaments, chemical (submarine explosives), paper production (textbooks for salamanders), cement, wood, artificial foods. (Salamander-Food) and many other industries, ship tonnage increased by 27% compared to pre-new periods, coal mining by 18.6%. Indirectly, by increasing employment and well-being among people, turnover is also rising in other industries. Then, at the last time, Newts ordered various machine parts according to their own drawings, of which they assemble their own underwater pneumatic drills, hammers, submarine engines, printing machines, water radios and other machines of their own design. They pay for these components with increased work output, today a fifth of all world production in heavy industry and fine mechanics is dependent on salamander orders. Cancel Salamanders, and you can close a fifth of the factories, instead of today's prosperity you will have millions of unemployed. However, the International Labor Office could not ignore these objections; in the end, after a long negotiation, at least a compromise was reached: that they may not mine coal or oil on the seabed, that they may not produce paper, textiles or artificial skins of seaweed for terrestrial abstraction ""and so on, those restrictions we do not mention them mainly because of course they were ignored nowhere, but as a generous, truly international solution to the Newt's Problem from an economic and social point of view, the code was a meritorious and impressive work.","Now the International Bureau of Employment in Geneva began to concern itself with the Newt Problem. Here there were two views in opposition to each other; one side acknowledged the newts as a new working class and strove to have all social legislation extended to them, regulating length of working day, paid holidays, insurance for invalidity and old age and so on; the other view, in contrast, declared that the newts were a growing danger as competition for human manpower and working newts were anti-social and should simply be banned. Not only employers' representatives objected to this idea but also delegates from the working people, pointing out that the newts were not just a new army of workers but also a major and growing market. As has been said, in recent times the numbers employed in metal working (working tools, equipment, metal idols for the newts), weapon manufacture, chemical industry (underwater explosives), paper industry (schoolbooks for the newts), cement manufacture, forestry, artificial foodstuffs (Salamander food) and many other areas had all risen at a rate unprecedented in peace time; there was a rise of 27% in shipping tonnage compared with the period before the newts, coal production increased by 18.6%. The rise in employment and prosperity for people indirectly caused a rise in turnover in other branches of industry too. Most recently, the newts had been ordering more engineering parts according to their own designs, using them to assemble pneumatic drills, hammers, underwater motors, printing machinery, underwater radio equipment and other machinery, all to their own plans and all done underwater. These machine parts were paid for by higher productivity; by now a fifth of all world production in heavy industry and in fine mechanics were dependent on orders from the newts. If you put an end to the newts you can put an end to one factory in five; instead of modern prosperity there would be millions unemployed. The International Bureau of Employment could not, of course, simply ignore this objection, and in the end, and after long discussion, it arrived at this compromise solution, that “the above named group of employees, S (amphibians), may be employed only on water or underwater, and on the shore only as far as ten meters above the high water line; they may not extract coal or oil from beneath the seabed; they may not produce paper, textiles, or artificial leather made from seaweed to be marketed on land” and so on; these restrictions on newt manufacturing were set out in nineteen legal paragraphs which we will not cite in more detail, mainly because, needless to say, nobody paid them any attention; but as a magnanimous and truly international solution to the Newt Problem in the fields of commerce and society it was held up as a useful and imposing achievement.","At that point the International Labour Office in Geneva began to take up the Newt Problem. There two views clashed sharply: one recognised the Newts as a new working class and demanded that all social legislation affecting working hours, paid holidays, sickness and old-age insurance, etc., should be extended to them; the opposing view was that the Newts represented a dangerous competition to the human workforce and that Newt labour should quite simply be prohibited. This suggestion was opposed not only by the representatives of the employers but also by the workers’ delegates, who pointed out that the Newts were no longer merely an army of workers but also a large and ever growing body of consumers. They demonstrated that employment had recently increased to an unprecedented degree in the metal industry (working tools, machines and metal idols for Newts), in armaments, chemicals (underwater explosives), paper making (textbooks for Newts), cement, timber, synthetic foodstuffs (Salamander Food) and many other branches of industry. The shipping tonnage had risen by 27 per cent over pre-Newt figures, and coal by 18.6 per cent. Indirectly, as human employment and prosperity increased, turnover rose also in other industries. Most recently the Newts had been placing orders for various parts of machinery according to their own designs; these they themselves assembled below water into pneumatic drills, hammer-drills, submarine engines, printing machinery, underwater transmitters and other equipment of their own design. These products they paid for by an increased work performance: already one-fifth of world production by heavy industry and precision engineering was dependent on Newt orders. Abolish the salamanders and you could close down one-fifth of the factories; instead of the present prosperity you would have millions of unemployed. Naturally enough, the International Labour Office could not disregard these objections; finally, after long negotiations, a compromise solution was reached to the effect that ‘the above-mentioned employees of group S (amphibians) may only be employed below or in the water, or on the foreshore up to a maximum of 10 metres from the high water line; that they must not mine coal or extract oil from the seabed; that they must not manufacture paper, textiles or artificial leather from seaweed for consumption on dry land’, and so on. These restrictions on Newt production were laid down in a code of nineteen paragraphs which we do not propose to quote in detail if only because, needless to say, no one took any notice of them. But as a generous and truly international solution of the Newt Problem from the economic and social standpoint the above-mentioned code was a meritorious and impressive achievement"
"Dohrává se tragédie lidského rodu, začal Wolf Meynert. Ať nás nemate jeho horečná podnikavost a technický blahobyt, to je jen hektická červeň na tváři organismu už poznamenaného smrtí.

"Koneckonců, je docela přirozené, že Mloci přestali být senzací, jakmile jich bylo na světě do set miliónů, lidový zájem, který vyvolali, dokud ještě byli jakous takous novinkou, dozníval ještě po nějaký čas ve filmových groteskách (Sally and Andy, dva dobří Salamandři) a na kabaretních scénách, kde zpěváci a subrety, nadaní zvláště špatným hlasem, vystupovali v neodolatelné roli skřehotajících a gramaticky chatrně se vyjadřujících Mloků. Jakmile se Mloci stávali hromadným a všedním úkazem, měnila se, abychom tak řekli, jejich problematika. Pravda je, že veliká mločí senzace záhy vyvanula, aby učinila místo něčemu jinému a do jisté míry solidnějšímu, totiž Mločí Otázce. Předbojovníkem Mločí Otázky - jako ne poprvé v dějinách lidského pokroku - byla ovšem žena. Byla to Mme Louise Zimmermann, ředitelka dívčího penzionátu v Lausanne, která s nevšední energií a neochabujícím nadšením propagovala po celém světě své ušlechtilé heslo: Dejte Mlokům řádnou školní výchovu! Dlouho se setkávala s nepochopením veřejnosti, když neúnavně upozorňovala jednak na přirozenou učelivost Mloků, jednak na nebezpečí, které by mohlo lidské civilizaci vyrůst, kdyby se Salamandrům nedostalo pečlivé mravní i rozumové výchovy. ""Jako římská kultura zanikla vpádem barbarů, zanikla by i naše vzdělanost, kdyby byla ostrovem v moři tvorů duševně ujařmených, jimž je upírán podíl na nejvyšších ideálech dnešního lidstva,"" tak volala prorocky na šesti tisících třech stech padesáti sedmi přednáškách, jež absolvovala v ženských klubech po celé Evropě i Americe, jakož i v Japonsku, Číně, Turecku a jinde. ""Má-li se kultura udržet, musí být vzdělaností všech. Nemůžeme v klidu požívat darů naší civilizace ani plodů naší kultury, dokud kolem nás existují milióny a milióny nešťastných a nízkých bytostí, uměle udržovaných ve stavu animálním. Tak jako heslem devatenáctého století bylo Osvobození Ženy, musí být heslem našeho věku: DEJTE MLOKŮM ŘÁDNÉ ŠKOLY!"" A tak dále. Dík své výmluvnosti a neuvěřitelné houževnatosti zmobilizovala Mme Louise Zimmermann ženy celého světa a sehnala dostatečné finanční prostředky, aby založila v Beaulieu (u Nice) První lyceum pro Mloky, na kterém byl potěr Salamandrů pracujících v Marseille a Toulonu vyučován ve francouzské řeči a literatuře, rétorice, společenském chování, matematice a kulturních dějinách. Se zdarem o něco menším se setkala Dívčí škola pro Mloky v Mentonu, kde hlavně kursy v hudbě, dietetické kuchyni a jemných ručních pracích (na nichž Mme Zimmermann trvala z důvodů hlavně pedagogických) se setkávaly s nápadným nedostatkem učenlivosti, ne-li přímo s tvrdošíjným nezájmem mladistvých mločích lyceistek. Proti tomu hned první veřejné zkoušky Mladých Mloků měly tak překvapující úspěch, že vzápětí byla (nákladem spolků pro ochranu zvířat) zřízena Námořní polytechnika pro Mloky v Cannes a Mločí univerzita v Marseille, zde později první Mlok dosáhl gradu doktora práv.","After all, it is quite natural that Newts ceased to be a sensation as soon as there were hundreds of millions of them in the world, the popular interest they aroused while they were still a kind of novelty lingered in film grotesques for some time (Sally and Andy, two good Salamanders ) and on cabaret scenes, where singers and subroutes, gifted with a particularly bad voice, performed in the irresistible role of Newt-crunching and grammatically expressive Newts. As Newts became a mass and mundane phenomenon, their problem changed, so to speak. The truth is that the great salamander sensation soon faded to make way for something else and somewhat more solid, namely the Newt Question. However, as a forerunner in the history of human progress, New Zealand's forerunner of Questions was a woman. It was Mme Louise Zimmermann, the director of the girls' boarding house in Lausanne, who, with extraordinary energy and unwavering enthusiasm, promoted her noble slogan around the world: Give the Newts a proper schooling! For a long time, she encountered a public misunderstanding when she tirelessly drew attention to both the natural teachings of Newts and the dangers that could have arisen for human civilization if the Salamanders had not received careful moral and intellectual education. ""As Roman culture disappeared with the invasion of barbarians, so would our education if it were an island in a sea of mentally destitute creatures who are denied a share in the highest ideals of today's humanity,"" she said prophetically in six thousand three hundred and fifty-seven lectures she gave in women's clubs throughout Europe and America, as well as in Japan, China, Turkey and elsewhere. ""If culture is to be sustained, it must be the education of all. We cannot enjoy the gifts of our civilization or the fruits of our culture in peace as long as there are millions and millions of unfortunate and low beings around us, artificially maintained in an animal state. Women must be the slogan of our age: GIVE THE GOGRAPHS A PROPER SCHOOL! "" And so on. Thanks to her eloquence and incredible tenacity, Mme Louise Zimmermann mobilized women around the world and raised enough funds to establish in Beaulieu (near Nice) the First Lyceum for Newts, where the spawn of Salamanders working in Marseille and Toulon was taught in French language and literature, rhetoric. , social behavior, mathematics and cultural history. The Girls' Salamander School in Menton met with a little less success, where mainly courses in music, diet cuisine and fine handicrafts (which Mme Zimmermann insisted on for mainly pedagogical reasons) were met with a noticeable lack of learning, if not outright stubbornness. lack of interest in juvenile newt salamanders. On the other hand, the first public examinations of the Young Newts were so surprisingly successful that the Naval Polytechnic for Newts in Cannes and the Newt University in Marseille were established (at the expense of animal protection associations), where the first Newt later obtained a doctorate in law.","In short, it was entirely natural that the newts stopped being a sensation, even though there were now as many as a hundred million of them; the public interest they had excited had been the interest of a novelty. They still appeared now and then in films (Sally and Andy, the Two Good Salamanders) and on the cabaret stage where singers endowed with an especially bad voice came on in the role of newts with rasping voices and atrocious grammar, but as soon as the newts had become a familiar and large-scale phenomenon the problems they presented, so to speak, were of a different character. 13 Although the great newt sensation quickly evaporated it was replaced with something that was somewhat more solid—the Newt Question. Not for the first time in the history of mankind, the most vigorous activist in the Newt Question was of course a woman. This was Mme. Louise Zimmermann, the manager of a guest house for girls in Lausanne, who, with exceptional and boundless energy, propagated this noble maxim around the world: Give the newts a proper education! She would tirelessly draw attention both to the newts' natural abilities and to the danger that might arise for human civilisation if the salamanders weren't carefully taught to reason and to understand morals, but it was long before she met with anything but incomprehension from the public. 14 “Just as the Roman culture disappeared under the onslaught of the barbarians our own educated civilisation will disappear if it is allowed to become no more than an island in a sea of beings that are spiritually enslaved, our noble ideals cannot be allowed to become dependent on them,” she prophesied at six thousand three hundred and fifty seven lectures that she delivered at women's institutes all over Europe, America, Japan, China, Turkey and elsewhere. “If our culture is to survive there must be education for all. We cannot have any peace to enjoy the gifts of our civilisation nor the fruits of our culture while all around us there are millions and millions of wretched and inferior beings artificially held down in the state of animals. Just as the slogan of the nineteenth century was 'Freedom for Women', so the slogan of our own age must be 'GIVE THE NEWTS A PROPER EDUCATION!' “ And on she went. Thanks to her eloquence and her incredible persistence, Mme. Louise Zimmermann mobilised women all round the world and gathered sufficient funds to enable her to found the First Newt Lyceum at Beaulieu (near Nice), where the tadpoles of salamanders working in Marseilles and Toulon were instructed in French language and literature, rhetoric, public behaviour, mathematics and cultural history. 15 The Girls' School for Newts in Menton was slightly less successful, as the staple courses in music, diet and cookery and fine handwork ( which Mme. Zimmermann insisted on for primarily pedagogical reasons) met with a remarkable lack of enthusiasm, if not with a stubborn hostility among its young students. In contrast with this, though, the first public examinations for young newts was such an instant and startling success that they were quickly followed by the establishment of the Marine Polytechnic for Newts at Cannes and the Newts' University at Marseilles with the support of the society for the care and protection of animals; it was at this university that the first newt was awarded a doctorate of law.","The experiments I conducted with the Pacific Giant Salamander (Andrias Scheuchzeri Tschudi) in my Hamburg laboratory pursued a very definite aim: to examine the Newts’ resistance to ambient changes and other external factors, and thereby to demonstrate their practical utility in different geographical regions and under different environmental conditions. The first series of experiments was designed to determine how long a Newt can live outside water. The experimental animals were kept in dry tanks at a temperature between 40° and 50°C. After a few hours they exhibited obvious signs of fatigue; if they were sprinkled they revived. After twenty-four hours they lay motionless, moving only their eyelids; their heartbeat was slowed down and all body activity reduced to a minimum. The animals were clearly suffering and the slightest movement entailed a great effort. After three days a state of cataleptic rigor (xerosis) set in: the animals did not react even to burning with the electric cautery. When the humidity of the air was increased they exhibited at least a few signs of life (they shut their eyes to bright light, etc.). If, after seven days, such a desiccated Newt was thrown into the water it recovered after some considerable time; with more prolonged desiccation, however, the major part of the experimental animals perished. In direct sunlight they die within a few hours. Other experimental animals were made to turn a shaft in the dark in a very dry environment. After three hours their performance began to decline but it rose again the moment they were copiously sprinkled with water. With frequently repeated sprinkling the animals managed to turn the shaft for seventeen, twenty, and in one instance twenty-six hours without interruption, whereas a control human would show considerable exhaustion after a mere five hours of identical mechanical performance. These experiments justify the conclusion that Newts are eminently suitable even for work on dry land, subject only to two conditions: that they are not exposed to direct sunlight and that they are hosed down with water over the whole surface of their bodies at frequent intervals. The second series of experiments was concerned with the resistance which the Newts, originally tropical animals, would show to cold. A sudden chilling of the water caused them to die of intestinal inflammation; if, however, they were gradually acclimatised to a cooler environment they adapted quite easily; after eight months they remained active even at a water temperature of 7°C, provided more fats were included in their diet (150 to 200 grammes per animal daily). If the water temperature was lowered below 5 °C they dropped into a state of hypothermic rigor (gelosis); in that condition they were refrigerated and kept frozen into a block of ice for several months; when the ice was melted and the water temperature rose to 5°C they again started to show signs of life, and at 7° to 10°C they began to seek food eagerly. This allows the conclusion that Newts can quite easily become adapted also to our climate and indeed as far north as northern Norway and Iceland. Polar climatic conditions would require further experiments. By contrast, the Newts exhibit considerable sensitivity to chemical factors: in experiments with greatly diluted alkali, industrial effluent, tanning agents, etc., their skin peeled off in strips and the experimental animals died of some kind of gangrene of the gills. This means that the Newts are not in fact suited to our rivers. In a further series of experiments we succeeded in determining how long a Newt can survive without food. They can go hungry for three weeks and more without showing any signs other than a certain lethargy. I let one experimental Newt starve for six months; for the final three months it slept incessantly and motionlessly; when I finally threw chopped liver into his tank it was so weakened that it failed to react at all and had to be artificially fed. After a few days it ate normally and was suitable for further experiments. The final set of experiments was concerned with the Newts’ powers of regeneration. If a Newt has its tail cut off it will grow a new one within a fortnight; with one Newt we repeated this experiment seven times with the same result. Likewise it will grow any severed legs again. In the case of one experimental animal we amputated all its four extremities and its tail; within thirty days it was again complete. If a Newt’s femur or shoulder-blade is broken its whole limb drops off and a new one grows in its place. The same is true if one of its eyes is removed or its tongue cut out; it is a matter of some interest that a Newt whose tongue we removed forgot how to talk and had to be taught afresh. If a Newt’s head is cut off or its body severed between its neck and pelvic bone the animal dies. On the other hand it is possible to remove its stomach, part of its intestines, two-thirds of its liver and other organs without damage to its vital functions; it can therefore be stated that an all but eviscerated Newt is still capable of life. No other animal has such resistance to all sorts of injury as a Newt. In that respect it would make a first-rate, almost indestructible, warfare animal; unfortunately its peacefulness and defencelessness militate against such use. Alongside these experiments my assistant Dr Walter Hinkel investigated the Newt’s value in terms of useful raw materials. He established in particular that the Newts’ bodies contain an exceptionally high proportion of iodine and phosphorus; it is not impossible that in case of need these important elements could be extracted industrially. The skin of Newts, inferior in itself, can be ground up and fed into powerful presses to produce an artificial leather that is light, reasonably strong and could serve as a substitute for ox-hide. Their fat is unfit for human consumption because of its revolting flavour but it is suitable as an industrial lubricant on account of its very low solidification point. Their flesh has also been considered to be unfit for consumption and indeed poisonous; when eaten raw it causes acute pain, vomiting and sensual hallucinations. Dr Hinkel established after numerous experiments conducted on himself that these harmful effects disappear if the cut meat is scalded with hot water (as in the case of some toadstools) and after thorough rinsing is pickled for twenty-four hours in a weak permanganate solution. After that it can be boiled or steamed, and will taste like inferior beef. In this way we consumed a Newt we used to call Hans; it was an educated and clever animal with a special talent for scientific work; it used to be employed in Dr Hinkel’s department as his laboratory assistant and it could be trusted with the most exacting chemical analyses. We used to have long chats with it in the evenings, amused by its insatiable thirst for knowledge. We were sorry to lose our Hans but he had lost his sight in the course of my trepanation experiments. His meat was dark and spongy but there were no unpleasant after effects. There is no doubt that in the event of war Newt meat might make a welcome and cheap substitute for beef. Besides, it was only natural that the Newts should have ceased to be a sensation once there were some 6 million of them in the world; the public interest they had aroused while they were still a novelty was echoed for a while in cartoon films (Sally and Andy, the Good Salamanders) and in cabaret, where singers and crooners endowed with particularly poor voices appeared in the roles of croaking and semi-grammatical Newts. The moment the Newts had become a mass-scale and commonplace phenomenon the whole question of the Newts, if we may so call it, underwent a change.9 The simple truth is that the great Newt sensation gave way to something different and, in a way, rather more solid: the Newt problem. The protagonist of the Newt problem - as so often before in the history of human progress - was, of course, Woman. It was Mme Louise Zimmermann, the directrice of a young ladies’ finishing school in Lausanne, who, with quite unusual energy and unflagging enthusiasm, propagated all over the world her noble slogan: A proper education for the Newts! For a long time she met with a lack of understanding from the public when she unceasingly pointed, on the one hand, to the Newts’ inborn capacity for learning and, on the other, to the danger that might arise to human civilisation if the salamanders were not given a careful moral and intellectual education. ‘ Just as the Roman civilisation collapsed with the invasion of the Barbarians, so our own learning would be extinguished if it remained just an island amidst a sea of spiritually oppressed creatures who are precluded from sharing in the highest ideals of present-day humanity,’ she exclaimed prophetically at the 6,300 lectures she gave to women’s clubs throughout Europe and America, as well as in Japan, China, Turkey and elsewhere. ‘If our civilisation is to survive it must be the learning of all. We cannot peacefully enjoy the gifts of our civilisation or the fruits of our culture while all around us there are millions and millions of wretched lower creatures deliberately kept in an animal state. Just as the slogan of the nineteenth century was the emancipation of women, so the slogan of our age must be: PROPER SCHOOLS FOR THE NEWTS!’ And so on. Thanks to her eloquence and incredible zeal Mme Louise Zimmermann mobilised women throughout the world and drummed up sufficient financial funds to endow the First Grammar School for Newts at Beaulieu (near Nice), where the young fry of salamanders working at Marseilles and Toulon were taught French language and literature, rhetoric, social deportment, mathematics and the history of civilisation.10 Rather less successful was a Girls’ School for Newts in Menton, where the syllabus consisted mainly of music, dietary cookery and fine needlework (subjects on which Mme Zimmermann insisted mainly on paedagogical grounds); these encountered a striking lack of enthusiasm if not indeed a stubborn lack of interest on the part of the young female Newt students. By way of contrast, the first public examinations for Young Newts proved such an astonishing success that a Naval Polytechnic for Newts was immediately set up in Cannes and a Newt University in Marseilles (both at the expense of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals); it was at the latter institution that the first Newt was subsequently to be awarded the degree of Doctor of Law."
