Once you’re shot, let us know then so that we could do on your belly in time. But what a soldier you are, look at him, he’s afraid that they will be using him for target practice. That is just what each soldier is supposed to like tremendously, each soldier must know that the more times the enemy shoots at him, the enemy’s stock of ammunition is also getting thinner by that much. By each shot which the enemy soldier sends against you he is diminishing his battle readiness.

"Švejk si mezitím prohlížel číslo na ručnici a ozval se: „4268! Takový číslo měla jedna lokomotiva v Pečkách na dráze na 16. koleji. Měli ji odtáhnout do depo v Lysý nad Labem, ku správě, ale vono to tak lehce nešlo, poněvadž, pane šikovateli, ten strojvůdce, který ji tam měl odtáhnout, měl velmi špatnou paměť na čísla. Tak ho traťmistr zavolal do svý kanceláře a povídá mu: ‚Na 16. koleji je lokomotiva číslo 4268. Já vím, že máte špatnou paměť na číslice, a když se vám nějaký číslo napíše na papír, že ten papír ztratíte. Dejte si ale dobrý pozor, když jste tak slabej na číslice, a já vám ukážu, že je to velice lehký, zapamatovat si jakýkoliv číslo. Podívejte se: Lokomotiva, kterou máte odtáhnout do depo v Lysý nad Labem, má číslo 4268. Tedy dávejte pozor: První číslice je čtyřka, druhá dvojka. Tedy si pamatujte už 42, to jest dvakrát 2, to je v pořadí zepředu 4, děleno 2 = 2, a zas máte vedle sebe 4 a 2. Teď se nelekejte. Kolikrát jsou dvakrát 4, vosum, není-liž pravda? Tak si vryjte v paměť, že vosmička je z čísla 4268 poslední v řadě. Zbývá ještě, když už si pamatujete, že první je 4, druhá 2, čtvrtá vosum, nějak chytře si zapamatovat tu šestku, co jde před osmičkou. A je to strašně jednoduchý. První číslice je 4, druhá dvojka, čtyři a dvě je šest. Tedy už jste si jistej, druhá od konce je šestka, a už nám ten pořad čísel nikdy nevymizí z paměti. Máte utkvěno v hlavě číslo 4268. Nebo můžete také dojít k týmuž vejsledku ještě jednodušeji …‘ “","Švejk, meanwhile, looked at the number on the towel and said, “4268! One locomotive in Pečky had such a number on the track at the 16th track. They were supposed to tow her to the depot in Lysý nad Labem, for administration, but the smell was not so easy, because, Mr. Chic, the driver who was supposed to tow her there had a very bad memory of numbers. So the trackmaster called him to his office and told him: 'There is a locomotive number 4268 on the 16th track. But be careful when you are so weak at numbers, and I will show you that it is very easy to remember any number. Take a look: The locomotive you have to tow to the depot in Lysý nad Labem has the number 4268. So be careful: the first digit is four, the second two. So remember 42 already, that is, twice 2, that is 4 in the order, divided by 2 = 2, and you have 4 and 2 next to each other. Now don't be afraid. How many times are there twice 4, vosum, isn't it? So keep in mind that the space bar is the last in line from number 4268. It remains, when you already remember that the first is 4, the second 2, the fourth wasp, somehow cleverly remember the six that goes before the eight. And it's terribly simple. The first digit is 4, the second two, four and two is six. So you're sure, the second from the end is six, and the series of numbers will never go out of our minds. You are stuck in the head number 4268. Or you can also get the same result even more easily… ‘“","He merely reminded him that the keeper of the battalion records, volunteer officer Marek, would be in the same truck with Schweik.","Švejk was in the meantime looking over the number on the rifle and sounded up: “4268! That was the number on a locomotive at the railroad in Pecky, on the 16th track. They were to pull it away to the depot in Lysá nad Labem, Bald on the Elbe for repairs, but it could not go so easily because, Quartermaster, Sir, the engineer who was to haul it away had a very bad memory for numbers. So the lineman called him into his office and was telling him: ‘On the 16th track there is locomotive number 4268. I know that you have a bad memory for numerals, and when one writes some number down on paper for you, you will lose that paper. But pay good attention since you’re so bad with numbers, and I will show you that it is very easy to remember any number. Take a look: The locomotive you’re supposed to pull away to the depot in Lysá nad Labem bears the number 4268. So pay attention: The first numeral is a four, the second is a two. Then remember already 42, that is two times 2, which is in the order of starting from the front 4, divided by 2=2, and there again you have 4 and 2 next to each other. Don’t spook now. How many times is two times 4, eight, isn’t that true? So engrave into your memory that the eight in the number 4268 is the last one in the row. Still left to do, since you remember already that the first is 4, the second 2, and the fourth eight, is to somehow cleverly remember the six which comes before the eight. And this is terribly simple. The first numeral is a 4, the second a two, four and two is six. So you’re already sure the second one from the back is a six, and the order of the numbers will now already never disappear from our memory. You have the number 4268 imbedded in your head.

"Švejk vážně pokračoval: „Von mu tedy začal vykládat ten jednodušší způsob, jak by si zapamatoval číslo lokomotivy 4268. Vosum bez dvou je 6. Tedy už zná 68. 6 bez 2 jsou 4, už tedy zná 4-68, a tu dvojku do toho je 4-2-6-8. Není také příliš namáhavé, když se to udělá ještě jinak, pomocí násobení a dělení. To se dojde taky k takovýmu výsledku. ‚Pamatujte si, ‘ povídal ten traťmistr, ‚že dvakrát 42 je 84. Rok má 12 měsíců. Vodečte se tedy 12 od 84, a zbývá nám 72, od toho ještě dvanáct měsíců, to je 60, máme tedy už jistou šestku a nulu škrtneme. Tedy víme 42684. Když jsme škrtli nulu, škrtneme i tu čtyřku vzadu, a máme velice klidně zase 4268, číslo lokomotivy, která patří do depo v Lysý nad Labem. Taky, jak říkám, s tím dělením je to lehké. Vypočítáme si koeficient podle celního tarifu.‘ Snad vám není špatně, pane feldvébl. Jestli chcete, tak já začnu třebas s General de charge! Fertig! Hoch an! Feuer! Hrome! Neměl nás pan hejtman posílat na slunce! Musím pro nosítka.“","Švejk continued seriously: ""So Von started to explain to him the easier way to remember the locomotive number 4268. Vosum without two is 6. So he already knows 68. 6 without 2 are 4, so he already knows 4-68, and that two of which is 4-2-6-8. It's also not too strenuous to do it any other way, using multiplication and division. This will also lead to such a result. 'Remember,' the trackmaster said, 'twice 42 is 84. A year is 12 months old. So get 12 out of 84, and we have 72 left, of which twelve more months, that's 60, so we already have a certain six and we delete zero. So we know 42684. When we crossed out zero, we also cut the four in the back, and we have very calmly again 4268, the number of the locomotive that belongs to the depot in Lysý nad Labem. Also, as I say, it's easy with that division. We'll calculate the coefficient according to the customs tariff. If you want, I'll start with the General de charge, for example! Funny! Hoch an! Fire! Thunder! The governor shouldn't have sent us to the sun! I need a stretcher. ""","He merely reminded him that the keeper of the battalion records, volunteer officer Marek, would be in the same truck with Schweik.","Švejk continued seriously: “So he then started telling him the simpler way of how he would remember the number of the locomotive 4268. Eight, take away two, is six. So he already knows 68. 6, take away 2, is 4, so then he already knows 4-68, and the two to put into it makes 4-2-6-8. It is also not very exerting when it’s done still differently, with the help of multiplication and division. One also arrives at that result. ‘Remember’, the lineman was saying, ‘that two times 42 is 84. There are 12 months in a year. Then 12 is subtracted from 84, and we are left with 72, take from that another twelve months, that is 60, so we have then the six secured already and we cross out the zero. So we know 42 68 4. Since we crossed out the zero, we’ll cross out the four at the back as well, and maintaining a calm disposition we have again 4268, the number of the locomotive which belongs to the depot in Lysá nad Labem. It is also easy, as I’ve been saying, using division. We compute the coefficient according to the customs tariff.’ You’re not getting sick Quartermaster, Sir, I hope. Should you wish, I will start then with Get ready for a salvo! Ready! High aim! Fire! Thunder on high! Mister Captain should not have sent us into the sun! I must go to fetch the stretcher.”"

"Švejk velice vážně a důrazně řekl: „Nic jste neprováděl, pane lajtnant, byl jste jenom na návštěvě v jednom vykřičeným domě. Ale to byl asi nějakej vomyl. Klempíře Pimpra z Kozího plácku taky vždycky hledali, když šel kupovat plech do města, a našli ho také vždycky v podobnej místnosti, buď u Šuhů, nebo u Dvořáků, jako já vás našel. Dole byla kavárna a nahoře v našem případě byly holky. Vy jste byl, pane lajtnant, asi na vomylu, kde se to vlastně nacházíte, poněvadž bylo horko, a když člověk není zvyklej pít, tak se v takovým teplu vopije i vobyčejným rumem, natož vy jeřabinkou, pane lajtnant. Tak jsem dostal rozkaz vám doručit pozvání k bešprechunku, než jsme vyrazili, a taky jsem vás tam našel u tý holky nahoře; z toho horka a jeřabinky jste mě ani nepoznal a ležel jste tam na kanapi vysvlečenej. Nijak jste tam neřádil, ani jste neříkal ‚Vy mě ještě neznáte‘, ale taková věc se může stát každýmu, když je horko. Někdo na to strašně trpí, jinej zas do toho přijde jako slepej k houslím. Kdybyste byl znal starýho Vejvodu, políra z Vršovic, ten vám si, pane lajtnant, umínil, že nebude pít žádný nápoje, po kterých by se vopil. Tak si dal ještě štamprle na cestu a vyšel z domova hledat ty nápoje bez alkaholu. Zastavil se tedy napřed v hospodě Na zastávce, dal si tam čtvrtičku vermutu a počal se nenápadně vyptávat hostinskýho, co vlastně pijou ti abstinenti. Von docela správně soudil, že čistá voda je i pro abstinenty přece jen krutej nápoj. Hostinskej mu tedy vysvětlil, že abstinenti pijou sodovky, limonády, mlíko a potom vína bez alkaholu, studenej oukrop a jiný lihuprostý nápoje. Z toho se starýmu Vejvodovi přece jen zamlouvala ta lihuprostá vína. Optal se ještě, jestli jsou také lihuprosté kořalky, vypil ještě jednu čtvrtičku, pohovořil si s hostinským vo tom, že je to vopravdu hřích se často vožírat, načež mu hostinskej řekl, že všechno na světě snese, jenom ne vožralýho člověka, kterej se jinde vožere a přijde k němu vystřízlivět flaškou sodovky a ještě udělá kravál. ‚Vožer se u mne, ‘ povídá hostinskej, ‚pak jseš můj člověk, ale jinak tě neznám. ‘ Starej Vejvoda tedy dopil a šel dál, až vám přišel, pane lajtnant, na Karlovo náměstí do obchodu s vínem, kam také někdy zacházel, a optal se tam, jestli nemají lihuprostá vína. ‚Lihuprostá vína nemáme, pane Vejvodo,‘ řekli mu, ‚ale vermut nebo šery.‘ Starýmu Vejvodovi bylo nějak hanba, tak tam vypil čtvrtku vermutu a čtvrtku šery, a jak tak sedí, seznámí se vám, pane lajtnant, s nějakým taky abstinentem. Slovo dalo slovo, pijou ještě po čtvrtce šery, a konečně se domluvili, že ten pán zná místo, kde se čepují lihuprostá vína. ‚Je to v Bolzánově ulici, jde se tam po schodech dolů a mají tam gramofon.‘ Za tuhle dobrou zprávu dal starej Vejvoda celou láhev vermutu na stůl a potom se voba vypravili do Bolzánový ulice, co se tam jde dolů po schodech a co tam mají gramofon. A skutečně, tam se čepovala samá ovocná vína, nejen lihuprostá, ale dokonce i bez alkaholu. Napřed si každej dal půl litru angreštovýho vína, potom půllitr rybízovýho vína, a když vypili ještě půl litru angreštovýho lihuprostého vína, počaly je brnět nohy po všech těch vermutech a šery předtím, počali křičet, aby jim přinesli úřední potvrzení, že co tady pijou, je lihuprostý víno. Voni že jsou abstinenti, a jestli jim to hned nepřinesou, že to tady všechno rozsekají i s gramofonem. Potom je policajti museli oba tahat po těch schodech nahoru do Bolzánovy ulice, museli je dát do truhly a museli je hodit do separace – voba dva museli bejt vodsouzený pro vožralství jako abstinenti.“","Schweik said very seriously and emphatically: ""You did nothing, Lieutenant, you were only visiting one shouted house. But it was probably some kind of vomit. They also always looked for Plumber Pimpra from Kozí pláček when he went to the city to buy sheet metal, and they always found it in a similar room, either at Šuhy's or at Dvořák's, as I found you. There was a cafe downstairs and in our case there were girls upstairs. You were, Mr. Lieutenant, probably on the vampire where you actually are, because it was hot, and when you are not used to drinking, you will drink ordinary rum in such heat, let alone rowan, Mr. Lieutenant. So I was ordered to deliver you an invitation to the Beechen before we left, and I also found you there at the girl upstairs; you didn't even know me from that heat and rowanberry and you were lying there on a couch undressed. You didn't go there, nor did you say, 'You don't know me yet,' but such a thing can happen to anyone when it's hot. Some people suffer terribly from it, others come into it as blind to the violin. If you had known the old Duke, a polisher from Vršovice, he had decided, Mr. Lieutenant, that he would not drink any drinks for which he would drink. So he set off on a trip and left home to look for the non-alcoholic drinks. So he stopped first at the pub At the bus stop, took a quarter of vermouth, and began to inconspicuously ask the innkeeper what the abstainers were actually drinking. Von quite rightly thought that clean water is still a cruel drink for abstainers. So Hostinská explained that abstainers drank sodas, soft drinks, milk and then alcohol-free wines, cold sweets and other non-alcoholic beverages. After all, the old Vejvoda liked the spirited wines. Asked if there were also spirits, he drank another quarter, talked to the innkeeper that it was indeed a sin to eat often, and then told the innkeeper that he would endure everything in the world, except for a drunken man who else he eats it and comes to sober up with a bottle of soda and makes a riot. 'Eat with me,' says the innkeeper, 'then you are my man, but otherwise I do not know you. Tedy So Old Vejvoda finished and went on when he, Mr. Lieutenant, came to Charles Square to the wine shop, where he also used to go, and asked if they had any wine-free wines. 'We don't have odd wines, Mr. Vejvoda,' they told him, 'but vermouth or gloom.' . Word spoke, they drank darkness after a quarter, and finally agreed that the gentleman knew the place where alcohol-free wines were tapped. “It's in Bolzano Street, they go down the stairs and they have a turntable there.” For this good news, old Vejvoda put a whole bottle of vermouth on the table, and then Voba went to Bolzano Street, where they went down the stairs and what they have a turntable. And indeed, the fruit wines themselves were served there, not only alcohol-free, but even without alcohol. First he gave each other half a liter of gooseberry wine, then a pint of currant wine, and when they drank another half liter of gooseberry spirits, their legs began to tingle with all those vermouths and glooms before they began to shout to give them official confirmation that what they drank here, is an alcohol-free wine. They smell like abstainers, and if they don't bring it to them right away, they'll cut it all off with a turntable. Then the cops had to both drag them up the stairs to Bolzano Street, put them in a coffin and throw them in the separation - two of them had to be tried for drunkenness like abstainers. ""","Schweik replied in very solemn and emphatic tones : ""You never behaved queerly, sir, not a bit of it. You was just paying a visit to a free-and-easy house. But I reckon there was some mistake about that. I expect, sir, you landed yourself in the wrong place because the weather was so hot, and if you ain't used to liquor, why, when it begins to get a bit warmer than usual, even ordinary rum'll get into your head, and you was drinking gin, sir. So I had orders to hand you a notice telling you to attend the officers' meeting that was going to be held before we started moving forward, and I found you upstairs with a young lady. And what with the gin and the hot weather and one thing and another, you didn't know who I was and you was lying undressed on a sofa. But you wasn't behaving queerly, sir, not by any manner of means. And as I was saying just now, sir, that's the sort of thing that might happen to anyone when the weather's hot. Some people can't stand it at all, and others take to it like a duck to water, as the saying is. If you'd have known old Vejvoda, a French-polisher he was, and he used to live down our way. Well, he made up his mind he'd never drink anything that'd make him tight. So off he goes one day to look for teetotal drinks. Just to give himself a proper send-off, like, he has a good glass of spirits before he starts. Well, at the first pub he comes to, he orders a vermouth, and in a cautious sort of way he begins to ask the landlord what it is the teetotallers drink. Because he thought, and he was quite right, too, that even teetotallers couldn't stand plain water. So the landlord explains to him that teetotallers drink soda water, lemonade, milk, cold skilly, teetotal wine and other beverages without alcohol. Old Vejvoda rather takes a fancy to the teetotal wine and asks whether there was any teetotal brandy as well. Then he had some more vermouth and tells the landlord what a shame it is for a man to be always getting boozed, and the landlord says he can stand anything except a man who gets boozed in somebody else's pub and then comes to him for a bottle of soda water to clear his head, and then kicks up a row in the bargain. ' If you want to get tight,' says the landlord, 'get tight here in my pub, or you're no friend of mine.' So then, sir, old Vejvoda -""","Švejk said very seriously and with great emphasis: “You were not acting up at all Lieutenant, Sir, you were only on a visit in one house of ill repute. But that was perhaps some mistake. They always used to be looking for tin-smith Pimpra from the Goat Place too when he would go to buy sheet metal in town, and they’d always find him too in a similar room, either at Šuhas’ or at Dvorák ’s, like I found you. There was a coffeehouse downstairs and upstairs there were gals in our case. You were, Lieutenant, Sir, perhaps mistaken about where it was that you were located because it was hot, and when a man is not used to drinking then in such heat he’ll get drunk on even ordinary rum, let alone rowan brandy, Lieutenant, Sir. So I got the order to deliver the invitation for the conference to you before we took off, and indeed, I found you by that gal upstairs; on account of the heat and the rowan brandy you probably didn’t recognize me and you were lying there on the sofa undressed. You weren’t acting up in any special way there, you weren’t even saying ‘You don’t know me yet’, but such a thing can happen to anybody when it’s hot. For some it’s a chronic condition they suffer from terribly, others for a change chance upon it like a blind man upon a violin. If you knew the old Vejvoda, the construction site foreman from Vršovice, let me tell you Lieutenant, Sir, he set in his mind that he wouldn’t drink any beverages from which he’d get drunk. So he still had just a shot for the road and walked out of the home to look for those beverages without alkeehol. He then made a stop first at the Rest Stop pub, had a little quarter liter of vermouth there and started inconspicuously inquiring of the pubkeeper what it really was that the abstinent drank. He very correctly judged that pure water was a very brutal beverage after all even for abstaining teetotalers. The pubkeeper then explained to him that an abstinent drank soda pops and mineral waters, lemonades, milk, and then wines without alkeehol, cold water-soup with garlic and other spirit-free beverages. From among those the sprit-free wines still appealed to old Vejvoda the best after all. He asked whether there were even spirit-free gins, drank one more little quarter, had a conversation with the pubkeeper regarding its being a real sin to be getting loaded often, to which the pubkeeper told him that he’d put up with anything in the world except a drunk man who gets drunk somewhere else and comes to him to sober up on a bottle of soda water and still stirs up a ruckus. ‘Get loaded here in my place,’ says the pubkeeper, ‘then you’re my man, but otherwise I don’t know you.’ Old Vejvoda then drank up and went on until he came, Lieutenant, Sir, to Karlovo square into a store with wine, where he’d also drop in sometimes, and he asked there whether they had spirit-free wines. ‘Spirit-free wines we don’t have Mister Vejvoda ,’ they told him, ‘but vermouth or sherry we do.’ Old Vejvoda felt somehow ashamed, so he drank a quarter of vermouth and a quarter of sherry there, and as he was sitting there he got acquainted Lieutenant, Sir, with another would-be-abstinent. One word led to another, they were still drinking a quarter of sherry at a time, and at last they came to an understanding that the gentleman knew a place where they had spirit-free wines on tap. ‘It is in the Bolzanova Street, there one goes down the stairs and they have a record player there.’ In return for this good news old Vejvoda put a whole bottle of vermouth on the table and then they both set out to Bolzánova Street where one goes down the stairs and where they have a record player there. And really, there they had nothing on tap but fruit wines, not only spirit-free, but even without alkeehol. Each first had a half liter of gooseberry wine, then a half liter of red currant wine, and when they drank up still another half liter of gooseberry spirit-free wine, their legs started falling asleep after all those vermouths and sherries of earlier, and they started shouting that they should bring them an official certificate that what they were drinking here was spirit-free wine. That they were abstinent, and if somebody didn’t bring them something right away they would trash the place and smash everything to pieces, including the record player. Afterwards the police had to be dragging both of them up the stairs into Bolzánova Street, and they had to put them in the box cart and throw them in the solitary - the both of them had to be convicted for drunkenness as abstaining teetotalers.”"

"Potom Švejk počal mluvit o známých rozkazech, které jim byly přečteny před vstoupením do vlaku.

"U některých posádek, jako například v Tridentu, místo prďoch říkalo se „náš starej hajzl“. Ve všech případech šlo o osobu starší, a jestli Švejk nazval v duchu poručíka Duba poloprďochem, vystihl naprosto logicky, že jak do stáří, tak do hodnosti a vůbec do všeho schází poručíkovi Dubovi do prďocha ještě padesát procent.","Some crews, such as Trident, used to say ""our old bastard"" instead of farts. In all cases, he was an older person, and if Švejk called Lieutenant Dub a half-ass in the spirit, he summed it up quite logically that both in old age and in rank, and in all of that, Lieutenant Dub still missed fifty percent in everything.","""Then just you remember, my fine fellow,"" said Lieutenant Dub in solemn and dignified tones, ""that something extremely unpleasant will happen to you, if you keep carrying on this propaganda of yours.""","In some garrisons, as for example in Trident, instead of old fart they would say “our old shithead”.

"Kousek dál hrál si jeden maďarský četník s jedním popem. Uvázal mu provaz kolem levé nohy, který držel v ruce, a nutil ho kolbou, aby pop tančil čardáš, přičemž trhal provazem, takže pop upadl na nos, a maje ruce svázané dozadu, nemohl vstát a dělal zoufalé pokusy obrátit se na záda, aby se snad tak mohl zvednout se země. Četník se tak tomu upřímně smál, až mu slzy tekly z očí, a když už pop se zvedal, trhnul provazem a pop byl opět na nose.","A little further on, a Hungarian gendarme was playing with one pop. He tied the rope around his left leg, which he held in his hand, and forced him with a bow to dance the chardas, tearing the rope so that the pop fell on his nose, and with his hands tied back, he couldn't get up and made desperate attempts to turn his back to perhaps so he could rise from the ground. The gendarme laughed so sincerely that tears welled up in his eyes, and when the pop was rising, he jerked the rope and the pop was on his nose again.","A little further on, a Magyar gendarme was having some fun with a priest. Round the priest's left foot he had tied a rope which he held in his hand, and with the butt end of his rifle he was making him dance a czardas, during which he pulled the rope so that the priest fell on his nose, and having his hands tied behind his back he could not get up, and made desperate attempts to turn over on his back, so that he might possibly stand up that way. The gendarme roared so heartily with laughter at this, that the tears came into his eyes and when the priest did at last manage to get on his feet, he pulled the rope again and once more the priest fell on his nose.","A bit farther a Hungarian State police cop was toying with a priest. He tied a rope which he held in his hand around the pop’s left leg, and was forcing him with the butt to dance czardas, while he was yanking the rope so that the priest fell on his nose, and having his hands tied in the back could not get up and was making desperate attempts to turn over on his back in order to be able perhaps thus to pick himself up off the ground.

"„Neškodilo by,“ řekl Chodounský, „kdyby nás někde čekali s nějakým dobrým obědem. To když jsme my na začátku vojny jeli do Srbska, tak jsme se přežrali na každé stanici, jak nás všude hostili. Z husích stehýnek jsme vyřezávali špalíčky toho nejlepšího masa a hráli s nimi ovčinec na plátech čokolády. V Oseku v Charvatsku nám přinesli do vagónu dva páni od veteránů velký kotel pečeného zajíce, a to už jsme nevydrželi a vylili jsme jim to všechno na hlavu. Po všech tratích jsme nic jiného nedělali, než blili z vagónů. Kaprál Matějka v našem vagóně se tak přecpal, že jsme museli dát mu přes břicho prkno a skákat po něm, jako když se šlape zelí, a to mu teprve ulevilo a šlo to z něho horem dolem. Když jsme jeli přes Uhry, tak nám házeli do vagónů na každé stanici pečené slepice. Z těch jsme nic jiného nejedli než mozeček. V Kapošfalvě házeli nám Maďaři do vagónů celé kusy pečených prasat a jeden kamarád dostal celou pečenou vepřovou hlavou tak do lebky, že potom toho dárce honil s überšvunkem přes tři koleje. Zato už v Bosně jsme ani vodu nedostali. Ale do Bosny, ačkoliv to bylo zakázané, měli jsme různých kořalek, co hrdlo ráčilo, a vína potoky. Pamatuji se, že na jedné stanici nás nějaké paničky a slečinky uctívaly pivem a my jsme se jim do konve s pivem vymočili, a ty jely od vagónu!","""It wouldn't hurt,"" Chodounsky said, ""if they were waiting for us somewhere with a good lunch. When we went to Serbia at the beginning of the war, we ate at every station, as they hosted us everywhere. We carved sticks of the best meat from goose legs and played a sheepfold on chocolate plates with them. In Osek, Croatia, two veteran gentlemen brought us a large cauldron of roasted hares, and we couldn't stand it anymore and poured it all over their heads. On all the tracks, we did nothing but beat the cars. Corporal Matějka was so overwhelmed in our car that we had to put a board over his belly and jump on it, like a cabbage being trampled on, and that only relieved him and it went up and down. As we drove through Hungary, they threw roast hens into the carriages at each station. We ate nothing but the cerebellum. In Kapošfalva, the Hungarians threw whole pieces of roast pigs into our wagons, and one friend got the whole roast pork head in our skulls, so that he then chased the donor with the Überšvunk over three tracks. But we didn't even get water in Bosnia anymore. But to Bosnia, although it was forbidden, we had a variety of liquor, which throated the throat, and wine streams. I remember that at one station some ladies and girls adored us with beer and we urinated in their beer cans, and they drove away from the car!",,"“It wouldn’t do any harm,” said Chodounský, “if they were waiting for us somewhere with a good lunch. When we were riding to Serbia at the beginning of the war we overfed ourselves at every station, that’s how well they were hosting us everywhere. We were carving out little wedges of the best meat from the goose thighs and played sheep-pen checkers with them on tablets of chocolate. At Osek in Croatia two gentlemen from the veterans outfit brought a big cauldron of baked hare into the car for us, and right there we couldn’t hold back anymore and poured it all on their heads. We were doing nothing else along all the tracks but puking out of the cars. Corporal Matejka in our car overstuffed himself so much that we had to put a plank across his belly and be jumping on it like when cabbage is stomped, and only that made him feel a little better, and it was coming out of him top and bottom. When we were being hauled across Hungary they were throwing baked chickens into the cars for us at every station. We would eat nothing of them but the little brains. In Kapošfalva the Hungarians were pitching whole large pieces of roasted pigs into the cars and one pal got hit in the skull so hard with a whole roasted head of a porker that he was then chasing the benefactor with his belt in hand across three tracks. On the other hand, once we were in Bosnia we didn’t even get water. But for Bosnia, although it was forbidden, we had brought as much assorted booze along as the gullet would please and of wine there was creeks-full. I remember that in one station some prissy married women and young ladies were honoring us with beer and we urinated into their can of beer, and boy, did they beat it away from the car!"

Že nějaká Marta, na té stránce, přistoupila k psacímu stolu a vytáhla odtud nějakou roli a uvažovala hlasitě, že obecenstvo musí cítit soustrast s hrdinou role. Potom se ještě objevil na té stránce nějaký Albert, který neustále se snažil mluvit žertovně, což vytrženo z neznámého děje, který před tím předcházel, zdálo se takovou hovadinou, že nadporučík Lukáš překousl vzteky špičku na cigarety.","""Gentlemen,"" he said with a terribly mysterious expression, ""never forget page 161!""

They had pored over page 161, but could make nothing of it except that a lady named Martha approached a desk, from which she extracted the acting version of a play and in a loud voice expressed the view that the public must sympathize with the hero of it.

"Nadporučík Lukáš během celé přednášky hejtmana Ságnera, která skončila takovým fiaskem, dopracoval se k jisté detektivní schopnosti, k čemuž nebylo třeba mnoho obzvláštních kombinací, neboť den před odjezdem hlásil Švejk nadporučíkovi Lukášovi: „Pane obrlajtnant, na batalióně jsou nějaký knížky pro pány lajtnanty.

"Švejk vytáhl z ušpiněné kožené tašky zamaštěný dopis a četl, zachovávaje krok s koněm nadporučíka Lukáše, který se dal do mírného poklusu: „Ty pacholku mizernej, ty jeden vrahu a bídáku! Pan kaprál Kříž přijel do Prahy na urláb a já jsem s ním tančila u Kocanů, a von mně povídal, že prej ty tancuješ v Budějovicích u Zelený žáby s nějakou pitomou flundrou a že jsi mě už úplně vopustil. Aby jsi věděl, píšu toto psaní na hajzlu na prkně vedle díry, mezi náma je konec. Tvoje bejvalá Božena. Abych nezapomněla, ten kaprál to umí a bude tě ještě sekýrovat, já jsem ho vo to prosila. A ještě abych nezapomněla, nenajdeš mě už mezi živejma, až přijedeš na urláb. – To se ví,“ pokračoval při mírném poklusu Švejk, „že když jsem přišel na urláb, že byla mezi živejma, a ještě mezi jakejma živejma. Našel jsem ji taky u Kocanů, voblíkali ji dva vojáci vod cizího regimentu a jeden z nich byl tak moc živej, že jí šahal docela veřejně pod živůtek, jako kdyby chtěl, poslušně hlásím, pane obrlajtnant, vytáhnout odtamtud pel její nevinnosti, jak říká Věnceslava Lužická nebo jak to podobně jednou řekla jedna mladá dívka asi šestnáctiletá v tanečních hodinách jednomu gymnazistovi hlasitě s pláčem, když ji štípl do ramena: ‚Vy jste, pane, setřel pel mého panenství.‘ To se ví, že se všichni smáli a její matinka, která ji tam hlídala, že ji vodvedla na chodbu v Besedě a že tu svou blbou nánu zkopala. Já přišel, pane obrlajtnant, k tomu názoru, že přece jenom ty venkovský holky jsou upřímnější než ty takový utahaný městský slečinky, který chodějí do nějakejch tanečních hodin. Když jsme před lety stáli lágrem v Mníšku, tak jsem chodil tancovat do Starýho Knína, namluvil jsem si tam nějakou Karlu Veklovou, ale moc jsem se jí nelíbil. Jednou večer v neděli jsem ji doprovázel k rybníčku, tam jsme si sedli na hráz a ptal jsem se jí, když zapadalo slunce, jestli mě má taky ráda. Poslušně hlásím, pane obrlajtnant, že byl vzduch tak vlahej, všichni ptáci zpívali, a vona mně vodpověděla s příšerným smíchem: ‚Já mám tě tak ráda jako pazdero v prdeli, vždyť jseš blbej.‘ A já byl taky vopravdu blbej, tak strašně blbej, že jsem vám, poslušně hlásím, pane obrlajtnant, předtím chodíval mezi polma, mezi vysokým vobilím v liduprázdnej prostoře, ani jsme si jednou nesedli, a já jí jen ukazoval po tom božím požehnání, a pitomec, tej selskej holce vykládám, že tohle je žito, tohle že je pšenice a tohle že je voves.“","Schweik pulled a greasy letter from a soiled leather bag and read, keeping pace with Lieutenant Lukáš's horse, who trotted down slightly: Mr. Corporal Kříž came to Prague for a chore and I danced with him at the Kocans, and he told me outside that you danced in Budějovice at the Green Frog with some stupid flounder and that you had completely let me in. Just so you know, I'm writing this shit on a board next to a hole, it's over between us. Your ex-Bozena. Not to forget, the corporal can do it and will still hatch you, I begged him to. And lest I forget, thou shalt not find me alive, till thou be come. ""It is known,"" Švejk continued with a slight trot, ""that when I came to the rebels, she was among the living, and still among some living. I also found her at the Kocans, she was surrounded by two soldiers from the waters of a foreign regiment, and one of them was so alive that he touched her quite publicly under her bodice, as if he dutifully reported, Mr. Lieutenant, to pull out the pollen of her innocence, as Věnceslava says. Lusatian, or as a young girl of about sixteen, once said in a dance class to a high school student, cried loudly as he pinched her shoulder: 'You, sir, wiped the pollen of my virginity.' It is known that everyone laughed and her mother who was guarding her there, that she had led her to the corridor in Beseda and that she had kicked her stupid woman. I have come to the conclusion, Mr. Lieutenant, that the country girls are more honest than the kind of tired urban girls who go to some dance classes. When we were standing by the camp in Mníšek years ago, I went to Starý Knín to dance, I spoke a Karel Veklová there, but I didn't like it very much. One Sunday evening I accompanied her to the pond, where we sat on the dike and asked her when the sun was setting if she liked me too. I obediently report, Lieutenant, that the air was so damp, all the birds sang, and the fragrance said to me with a terrible laugh, 'I love you as much as a shit, you are stupid.' And I was really stupid, so terribly stupid that I obediently report to you, Lieutenant, I used to walk among the polma, among the tall people in a deserted space, we didn't even sit down once, and I just showed her after that divine blessing, and idiot, that peasant girl, I explain that this is rye, this is wheat and this is voves. ""","From a grimy pocketbook Schweik extracted a grease-stained letter, and still keeping in step with Lieutenant Lukash's horse, which had broken into a gentle trot, he read : ""You rotten blighter, you dirty, low-down crook. Corporal Kriz went to Prague on leave, and he told me you've been dancing with some boss-eyed little slut and that you've given me the push. All right then, we're through with each other. Bożena. And let me tell you that corporal is a regular sport, and he won't half lay you out. I asked him to. And let me tell you that when you come back on leave you won't find me in the land of the living."" ""Of course,"" explained Schweik, keeping in step with the gentle trotting of the horse, ""when I did come back on leave, I found her in the land of the living all right.","Švejk pulled a grease stained letter out of a soiled leather bag and was reading, keeping pace with the horse of Senior Lieutenant Lukáš, who started to trot gently: “You miserable creep, you murderer and scoundrel! Mister Corporal Kríž arrived in Praha for leave and I was dancing with him at the Kocans’, and he was telling me that in Budejovice you supposedly dance with some numskull floozie at the Green Frog and that you have already totally abandoned me. To let you know, I am writing this letter on the plank next to the hole in the shithouse, it’s the end between us. Yours, formerly, Božena. So that I would not forget, this Corporal knows how to do it and he will yet be busting your chops, I was begging him to do that. And another thing, so that I would not forget, you won’t find me among the living ones anymore when you come home on leave. — It figures,” Švejk continued in the gentle trot, “that when I came on leave she was among the living, and among the ones living it up on top of it. I indeed found her at the Kocans’, two soldiers from another regiment were dressing her and one of them was so much alive that he was feeling her altogether publicly under the bodice, as if he wanted, I dutifully report Senior Lieutenant, Sir, to pull the pollen of her innocence out of there, as the author of sentimental novels Venceslava Lužická says or as a young girl of about sixteen put it in a similar way once in a dancing class telling a Gymnasium student loudly and weeping when he pinched her shoulder: ‘Sir, you have wiped off the pollen of my virginity.’ It goes without saying that they all were laughing, and her mommy who was her chaperone there escorted her to the hallway in the Burghers' Club, and there she kicked that nitwit goose of hers silly. I had come Senior Lieutenant, Sir, to hold the opinion that the country girls are after all more sincere than such dragged-down tired prissy little misses in the city who go to some dance lessons. When years ago we were at camp in Mníšek, I used to go dancing in the Starý Knín, there I talked up some girl named Karla Veklová, but she didn’t like me much. One Sunday evening I was escorting her to a little pond, there we sat on the dam and when the sun was setting I was asking her whether she loved me too. I dutifully report Senior Lieutenant, Sir, that the air was so moist, all the birds were singing, and she answered me with horrible laughter: ‘I like you as much as a husk in the ass, come on, you’re so stupid.’ And indeed, I was really stupid, so terribly stupid that I, I dutifully report Senior Lieutenant, Sir, used to walk through the fields, through the high standing wheat in a space empty of people, not even once did we sit down and I only kept showing her the blessings of God, and being the numskull, I was telling the farming gal that this was rye, this was wheat and that these were oats.”"

"Švejk odešel za perón a poručík Dub vzpamatovav se vydal se za ním.

"Poručík Dub byl v civilu profesorem češtiny a již v té době jevil neobyčejný sklon k tomu, aby všude, kde jen to bylo možno, mohl vyjádřit svou loajálnost. V písemných pracech předkládal svým žákům témata z dějin rodu habsburského. V nižších třídách strašil žáky císař Maxmilián, který vlezl na skálu a nemohl slézt dolů, Josef II. jako oráč a Ferdinand Dobrotivý. Ve vyšších třídách byla ta témata ovšem spletenější, jako kupříkladu úloha pro septimány: „Císař František Josef I., podporovatel věd a umění“, kteráž práce vynesla jednomu septimánovi vyloučení ze všech středních škol říše rakousko-uherské, poněvadž napsal, že nejkrásnějším činem tohoto mocnáře bylo založení mostu císaře Františka Josefa I. v Praze.","Lieutenant Dub was a professor of Czech in civilian clothes and already at that time he showed an extraordinary tendency to be able to express his loyalty wherever possible. In his written works, he presented to his students topics from the history of the Habsburg family. In the lower classes, the pupils were haunted by Emperor Maximilian, who climbed a rock and could not go down, Joseph II. as a plowman and Ferdinand the Benevolent. In the upper classes, however, the topics were more complex, such as the role of septimans: ""Emperor Francis Joseph I, supporter of science and art"", which earned one septiman the exclusion from all high schools of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, because he wrote that the most beautiful act of this The monarch was the foundation of the bridge of Emperor Francis Joseph I in Prague.","In civil life Lieutenant Dub was a school master who taught Czech as a special subject, and even before the war he had displayed an extraordinary propensity for ramming his loyalty down people's throats on every possible occasion. The subjects for essays which he used to choose for his pupils were all taken from the history of the House of Habsburg. He had once set the top class an essay on ""Emperor Franz Josef I as a Patron of the Arts and Sciences,"" and the result of this had been that one pupil was disqualified from ever again entering a secondary school in the Austro-Hungarian Empire for having written that this ruler's finest achievement had been to establish the Franz Josef I Bridge in Prague.","Lieutenant Dub was, in his civilian life, a professor of Czech and was at that time already exhibiting an unusual tendency everywhere, just wherever it was possible, to find an opportunity to express his loyalty. In writing assignments he would present to his pupils subject themes from the history of the Habsburg dynasty. Scaring the pupils in the lower grades were Emperor Maxmilián, who climbed atop a rock and could not get down, Josef II as a tiller, and Ferdinand the Benign. In the higher grades the subject themes were of course more concocted, as for example the assignment for the twelfth-graders: “ Emperor Franz Josef I, supporter of sciences and art”, which working assignment in the case of one twelfth-grader resulted in his being expelled from all the high schools of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, because he had written that the most beautiful act of this monarch was the erecting of the František Josef I. bridge in Praha."""

Old geezer was looking after his soldiers, the mess had to be in order, but he would always have some hobby; he clung to something, became obsessed with it, and therefore was “an old geezer”."

"„Poslušně hlásím, pane obrlajtnant, že už se vypravil,“ rozjasněně hlásil Baloun. „Řekl, že pan obrlajtnant bude spokojen a že panu obrlajtnantovi budou všichni závidět. Šel někam z nádraží a říkal, že to tady zná až za Rákošpalotu. Kdyby snad vlak bez něho odjel, že se přidá k automobilové koloně a dohoní nás na nejbližší stanici automobilem. Abychom byli o něj bez starosti, on ví, co je jeho povinnost, i kdyby si měl na svý outraty vzít fiakra a ject s ním za ešalonem až do Haliče. Dá si to potom strhovat z lénunku. Rozhodně nemáte prý mít o něho starost, pane obrlajtnant.“","""I dutifully report, Lieutenant, that he's gone,"" Baloun said brightly. ""He said that the lieutenant would be satisfied and that everyone would envy the lieutenant. He went somewhere from the station and said that he only knew it here after Rákošpalota. If the train left without him, he would join the convoy and catch up with us at the nearest station by car. To take care of him, he knows what his duty is, even if he has to take a fiacre on his outrats and drive with him to the echelon to Galicia. He can then pull it off the cling. You certainly don't have to worry about him, Lieutenant. ""","Lieutenant Dub wavered and said that he had asked for Schweik to be punished in the broader sense of the term and that perhaps Schweik was not capable of expressing himself properly and his answers only seemed to be impudent, insulting and lacking in respect toward his superiors.","“I dutifully report, Senior Lieutenant, Sir, that he’s set out already,” the brightened up Baloun was reporting glowingly. “ He said that Mister Senior Lieutenant would be satisfied and that all would be jealous of Mister Senior Lieutenant. He went somewhere at the railroad station and was saying that he knew his way around here all the way to Rákošpalota. If the train were to take off without him perhaps he’d join the automobile convoy and catch up with us at the nearest station in an automobile. We’re not to have any concern for him, he knows what his duty is, even if he were to, at his expense, take a fiakr10 and ride it following the military transport train all the way to Galicia. He will then let them deduct it from his soldier's pay. You are definitely not to have any concern for him, Senior Lieutenant, Sir."

"Generál řekl to s takovou jistotou, která znamenala, že jest sice již k jedenácté hodině noční, večeře že měla být v šest hodin, jak již prve poznamenal, takže nic jiného nezbývá než zadržet vlak přes noc a přes den do šesti hodin večera, aby dostali guláš s bramborem.","The general said it with such certainty that it meant that it was noon at eleven o'clock at night, as he had first noted, so there was nothing left but to hold the train overnight and during the day until six o'clock in the evening to they got goulash with potatoes.","Captain Sagner, who, as a regular officer, loathed all reserve officers, reminded Lieutenant Dub that proceedings of the kind which he was suggesting could be carried out only through the orderly room and not by any slapdash methods as if it were a case of haggling with a street hawker about the price of potatoes.","The General said it with such assuredness that it could only mean it was close to the eleventh hour of the night, to be sure, and the supper should have taken place at six o’clock, as he had already remarked earlier, so nothing else was left but to hold the train overnight and through the day until six o’clock in the evening in order for them to get their goulash with potatoes."

"„To nemám,“ s upřímností odpověděl Švejk. „Já vám chtěl jenom vyprávět, pane obrlajtnant, vo tom, jak dřív na vojně se lidi přiváděli sami do neštěstí. Von si ten člověk myslel, že je vzdělanější nežli ten pan obrlajtnant, chtěl ho s tím Měsícem snížit v očích manšaftu, a taky když dostal tu jednu pozemskou přes hubu, tak si vám tak všichni voddechli, nikoho to nemrzelo, navopak, všichni měli radost, že pan obrlajtnant udělal takovej dobrej vtip s tou pozemskou fackou; tomu se říká zachráněná situace. Člověka musí hned něco napadnout, a je už dobře. Naproti karmelitánům v Praze měl, pane obrlajtnant, před lety krám s králíky a jiným ptactvem pan Jenom. Ten si udělal známost s dcerou knihaře Bílka. Pan Bílek, ten tý známosti nepřál a taky prohlásil veřejně v hospodě, že kdyby pan Jenom přišel žádat o ruku jeho dcery, že ho srazí ze schodou, že to svět neviděl. Pan Jenom se na to napil, a přece jen šel k panu Bílkovi, kterej ho v předsíni uvítal s velkým nožem, kterým ořezávají ořízku, který vypadá jako žabikuch. Zařval na něho, cože tu chce, a vtom se vám milej pan Jenom upšouk tak silně, až se pendlovky na stěně zastavily. Pan Bílek se dal do smíchu, hned mu podal ruku a byl jen samé: ‚Račte dále, pane Jenom – račte se posadit – snad jste se nepokakal – vždyť já nejsem tak zlej člověk, je pravda, že jsem vás chtěl vyhodit, ale teď vidím, že jste docela příjemný pán, vy jste člověk originál. Jsem knihař, pročet jsem mnoho románů a povídek, ale v žádnej knížce jsem nečet, že by se ženich takhle představoval.‘ Smál se přitom, až se za břicho popadal, a povídal s náramnou radostí, že mu to připadá, jako by se znali vod narození, jako by to byli rodní bratři, snášel mu hned doutník, poslal pro pivo, pro taliány, zavolal ženu, představil jí ho se všema podrobnostma toho upšouknutí. Ta si vodplivla a šla pryč. Potom zavolal na dceru a povídá jí: ,Tenhle pán přišel požádat o tvoji ruku za takovejch a takovejch okolností.‘ Dcera se dala hned do pláče a prohlásila, že ho nezná, že ho nechce ani vidět, tak nezbejvalo nic jinýho, než aby vobá vypili pivo a snědli taliány a rozešli se. Potom pan Jenom měl ještě vostudu v tej hospodě, kam chodil pan Bílek, a nakonec se všude po celej čtvrti mu jinak neříkalo než ‚posránek Jenom‘ a všude si vypravovali, jak chtěl zachránit situaci. – Život lidský, poslušně hlásím, pane obrlajtnant, je tak složitej, že samotnej život člověka je proti tomu hadr. – K nám, do hospody ke Kalichu na Bojišti, chodíval ještě před válkou jeden policejní nadstrážník, nějakej pan Hubička, a jeden pan redaktor, kterej sbíral zlámaný nohy, přejetý lidi, sebevrahy a dával je do novin. To byl tak veselej pán, že bejval víc na policejní vachcimře než ve svý redakci. Ten jednou vopil toho pana nadstrážníka Hubičku a proměnili si šaty v kuchyni, takže nadstrážník byl v civilu a z pana redaktora stal se policejní nadstrážník, jenom si ještě zakryl číslo revolveru a vydal se do Prahy na patrolu. V Resslový ulici, za bejvalou Svatováclavskou trestnicí, potkal v nočním tichu staršího pána v cylindru a v kožichu, kterej šel zavěšen se starší paní v kožešinovém plášti. Voba spěchali domů a nepromluvili ani slova. Von na ně vypad a zařval tomu pánovi do ucha: ‚Neřvete tolik, nebo vás předvedu!‘ Představte si, pane obrlajtnant, to jejich leknutí. Marně mu vykládali, že to bude asi nějaká mejlka, poněvadž voba jedou z hostiny u pana místodržitele. Ekvipáž že je dovezla až za Národní divadlo a nyní že se chtí provětrat a bydlí nedaleko, na Moráni, on že je vrchní místodržitelskej rada s chotí. ‚Vy mě nebudete bulíkovat,‘ rozeřval se dál na něho převlečený redaktor, ‚to se musíte stydět, když jste, jak vy říkáte, nějakej vrchní místodržitelskej rada a chováte se přitom jako kluk. Já vás pozoruju už moc dlouho, jak jste třískal holí do roló všech krámů, který vám byly na cestě, a při tom vám vaše, jak vy říkáte, choť pomáhala.‘ ‚Vždyť já žádnou hůl, jak vidíte, nemám. To snad byl někdo před náma.‘ ‚Bodejť byste ji měl,‘ povídá na to převlečenej redaktor, ‚když jste ji přerazil, jak jsem viděl, támhle za rohem o jednu bábu, která chodí po hospodách s pečenejma bramborama a kaštanama.‘ Ta paní už ani plakat nemohla a pan vrchní místodržitelský rada rozčílil se tak, že začal mluvit něco vo sprosťáctví, načež byl zatčen a předveden k nejbližší patrole v rajónu komisařství v Salmově ulici, které řekl převlečený redaktor, aby ten párek odvedli na komisařství, on že je od Sv. Jindřicha a byl za služební cestou na Vinohradech, oba dopadl při rušení nočního klidu, při noční rvačce, a zároveň že ještě spáchali přestupek urážky stráže. On že si vyřídí svou věc na komisařství u Sv. Jindřicha a za hodinu že přijde na komisařství do Salmovky. Tak je voba patrola vodtáhla s sebou, kde seděli až do rána a čekali na toho nadstrážníka, který zatím voklikama se vrátil ke Kalichu na Bojiště, tam vzbudil nadstrážníka Hubičku a se vší šetrností mu sdělil, co se stalo a jaký bude z toho vyšetřování, jestli nebude držet hubu…“","""I don't have that,"" Schweik replied sincerely. ""I just wanted to tell you, Lieutenant, how people used to be in disaster before the war. Von thought the man was more educated than the lieutenant, he wanted to cut him with the Moon in the eyes of the crew, and when he got the one over the earth, everyone breathed you, no one was sorry, on the contrary, everyone was happy that Mr. Lieutenant made such a good joke with that earthly slap; this is called a rescued situation. You have to think of something right away, and you're fine. Opposite the Carmelites in Prague, Mr. Lieutenant, Mr. Jen had a shop with rabbits and other birds years ago. He made an acquaintance with the daughter of the bookbinder Bílek. Mr. Bílek, he did not want the acquaintance and also stated publicly in the pub that if Mr. Jenom came to ask for his daughter's hand, that he would be knocked down the stairs, that the world had not seen it. Mr. Jenom drank at it, and yet he went to Mr. Bílek, who greeted him in the hall with a large knife that cuts a crop that looks like a frog. He yelled at him, which he wanted, and then, dear Mr. Jenom, you snorted so hard that the pendulums on the wall stopped. Mr. Bílek laughed, immediately shook his hand and was just: 'Come on, Mr. Jen - come sit down - maybe you didn't wait - I'm not such a bad person, it's true that I wanted to fire you, but now I see that you are quite a nice gentleman, you are a man of the original. I am a bookbinder, I have read many novels and short stories, but I do not read in any book that the groom introduces himself like this. 'He laughed as he grabbed his stomach and said with great joy that he felt when he was born, as if they were native brothers, he immediately took a cigar, sent him for beer, for the Italians, called a woman, introduced him to her with all the details of the snag. She spat and walked away. Then he called his daughter and said, ""This gentleman has come to ask for your hand in such and such circumstances."" they drank beer and ate the Italians and parted ways. Then Mr. Jenom still had a walk in the pub where Mr. Bílek went, and in the end he was called ""shit Jenom"" everywhere in the neighborhood, and everywhere they told him how he wanted to save the situation. - Human life, I obediently report, Lieutenant, is so complex that human life itself is a rag. - Before the war, a police officer, a Mr. Hubička, and an editor who had collected broken legs, run over people, suicides and came to the newspapers used to come to our pub at Kalich on the Battlefield. He was such a cheerful gentleman that he used to be more at the police station than at his newsroom. He once sucked the officer Hubička and they changed their clothes in the kitchen, so the officer was in civilian clothes and the editor became a police officer, he just hid his revolver number and went to Prague for patrol. In Resslový Street, behind the former St. Wenceslas Penitentiary, in the night silence, he met an elderly gentleman in a top hat and fur coat, who went hanging with an elderly lady in a fur coat. Voba hurried home and didn't say a word. Von looked at them and shouted in the lord's ear, 'Don't yell so much, or I'll show you!' Imagine, Lieutenant, their fright. They told him in vain that it would probably be an affair, because the choir was coming from the feast of the governor. Enough that she brought them to the National Theater and now that she wants to ventilate and lives nearby, in Morán, he is the chief governor with his wife. 'You're not going to mess with me,' the disguised editor kept shouting at him, 'you have to be ashamed to be, as you say, some chief governor and act like a boy. I have been watching you for too long as you slammed your staff into the roles of all the shops that were in your way, and your wife, as you say, helped you. ' That must have been someone in front of us. ' the lady could not cry anymore, and the deputy governor's council became angry that he began to speak something outrageous, after which he was arrested and taken to the nearest patrol in the commission area in Salmova Street, which the disguised editor said to take the sausage to the commission, is from Sv. Jindřich and was on a business trip to Vinohrady, both of whom ended up disturbing the peace of the night, during a night fight, and at the same time that they still committed an offense of insulting the guards. He that he would settle his case at the commission at St. Henry and in an hour he will come to the commissary in Salmovka. So the patrol of the patrol pulled them with them, where they sat until morning and waited for the officer, who had returned to Kalich to the Battlefield. if he doesn't shut up… ""","""Oh, no, sir,"" replied Schweik breezily. ""I only wanted to show you, sir, how people get themselves into trouble in the army. That chap thought he was cleverer than Lieutenant Buchanek, and he wanted to score off him and take him down a peg or two in front of all the men, and so when he got that common or garden smack in the eye, we was all very much relieved. You take it from me, sir, we wasn't a bit sorry for him , in fact, we was all very pleased that the lieutenant answered him back and told him off properly and saved the situation, as you might say.""","“That I don’t,” Švejk said with sincerity. “I only wanted to tell you Senior Lieutenant, Sir, how in earlier times in the military people would bring about their own disaster. That man, he thought that he was more educated than the Mister Senior Lieutenant, he wanted to denigrate him in the eyes of the men with that Moon, and so indeed when he got one of those earthly slaps across the yap, let me tell you, they all breathed a sigh of relief, nobody felt sore on account of it, to the contrary, all were glad that Mister Senior Lieutenant made such a good joke about that earthly slap; that is what you call a prevented disaster. Man must think of something right away and then everything is alright already. Across the street from the Carmelite monastery in Praha Senior Lieutenant, Sir, years ago Mister Jenom, Onlythat, had a store there with rabbits and other birds. He made an amorous acquaintance with the daughter of bookbinder Bílek. Mister Bílek, Eggwhite, who was not favoring the familiar relationship, indeed publicly declared in a pub that if Mister Jenom came to ask for the hand of his daughter he’d knock him down the stairs in such a way that the world had not seen the likes of it. Mister Jenom had a drink to that, and after all still went to Mister Bílek, who welcomed him in the hallway with a big knife, the kind with which they cut the book-binder’s trim and which looks like a frog-gutter. He hollered at him asking what it was that he wanted here, and at that moment the dear Mister Jenom blew such a strong fart that the pendulum clock on the wall stopped. Mister Bílek busted out laughing, immediately extended his hand and was nothing but all: ’Condescend to come in Mister Jenom — condescend to sit down — hopefully you did not poop in your pants — come on , I am not such a mean man , it’s true that I wanted to throw you out, but now I see that you are a quite pleasant gentleman , you are an original man. I am a book-binder, I have read through many novels and stories, but in no book have I read that a groom would introduce himself like that.’ At the same time he was laughing so hard that he was grabbing his belly, and he was saying with tremendous joy that it seemed to him as if they had know one another from birth, as if they were native brothers, he brought him a cigar right away, sent for beer, for Italian sausage, he called his wife, introduced him to her with all the details of the letting out of the fart. She spat and walked away. Then he called his daughter and was telling her: ‘This gentleman came to ask for your hand under such and such circumstances.’ The daughter started weeping right away and declared that she didn’t know him, that she didn’t even want as little as just to lay her eyes on him, so there was nothing left but for both of them to finish drinking the beer and eat the Talians, and they parted. Then Mister Jenom was still subjected to yet another embarrassment at the pub where Mister Bílek used to go, and in the end everywhere around the neighborhood they wouldn’t call him anything other than ‘shitup Jenom’ and everywhere they were telling the story of how he wanted to prevent a disaster. — Human life, I dutifully report Senior Lieutenant, Sir, is so complicated that the life of a lone human is a rag in comparison. — To us, in the Chalice Pub at the Na Bojišti corner, used to come before the war a police Chief Patrolman, some Mister Hubicka, and one Mister editor who used to pick up broken legs, run over people, self-killers, and put them in the newspaper. He was such a merry man that he used to spend more time at the police station guard-house than in his newspaper office. He once got the Chief Patrolman Hubicka drunk and they swapped their clothes in the kitchen so that the Chief Patrolman was in civilian clothes and Mister editor turned into a police chief patrolman, then the only thing left for him to do was to cover up the serial number of his revolver and he took off into Praha on patrol rounds. In Resslova Street, behind the former St. Václav’s penitentiary, in the silence of the night he met an older gentleman in top hat and fur coat who was walking arm in arm with an older lady in a fur overcoat. They both were hurrying home and did not say a word. He jumped at them and shouted in that gentleman’s ear: ‘Don’t be screaming so much or I’ll bring you in!’ Imagine Senior Lieutenant, Sir, how they spooked. They were telling him in vain that it had be some mistake because they both were coming from a banquet given by the viceroy. The carriage and horses had taken them all the way to the far side of the National Theater and now he and his wife wanted to get some air and they lived nearby, at the Morán, and he was the Vice-royal Chief Counselor accompanied by his wife. ‘You won’t be hanging any bull on my nose,’ the disguised editor screamed at him again, ‘then you should be ashamed since you are, as you are saying, some vice-royal chief counselor and at the same time behave like a boy. I have been observing you for long already, how you’ve been banging the cane against the roller blinds of all the stores which were on your way, and at the same time your, as you’re saying, wife was helping you.’ ‘But I don’t have any cane as you can see. Perhaps it was somebody ahead of us.’ ‘No wonder you don’t have it,’ retorted the disguised editor, ‘since you broke it as I saw over there behind the corner whacking a hag with it who goes from pub to pub with baked potatoes and chestnuts.’ That lady could not even weep anymore and Mister Vice-royal Chief Counselor got so upset that he started saying something about vulgarity, after which he was arrested and brought to the nearest patrol in the district of the police station in Salmova Street, whom the disguised editor told to escort the pair to the police station building, saying that he was on the way from St. Jindrich and was in Vinohrady on business, had caught both in a breech of night peace during a night brawl, and that at the same time they had also committed the misdemeanor of insulting a patrolman. He said that he would take care of his thing at the police station by the St. Jindrich and that in an hour he would come to the station at Salmovka. So the patrol dragged both of them along to the station where they were sitting all the way until the morning and were waiting for the chief patrolman who in the meantime returned by detours to the Chalice at the Bojište, there he woke up the chief patrolman Hubicka and with all delicacy informed him of what had happened and what investigation it would entail if he didn’t keep his yap shut . . .”"

Je to horší, než když byla robota. Dřív že tomu tak na vojně nebylo. To že se ještě, jak jeho dědeček říkává doma na výměnku, oficíři za šestašedesáté války dělili s vojáky o slepice a chleba.

It's worse than when she was a robot. Before that was not the case in the war. The fact that, as his grandfather calls for an exchange at home, the officers shared hens and bread with the soldiers during the 1960s. There was no end to his lament, until Švejk finally found it good to praise the military situation during the current war.","Meanwhile Captain Sagner began in sheer desperation to read the wretched Sins of the Fathers, and when the train stopped at Raab, he closed the book with a jerk and remarked : ""This chap Ganghofer doesn't write badly.""","Švejk and the others had long since already stopped playing cards and the servant of Senior Lieutenant Lukáš, Baloun, was already so hungry that he started rebelling against the ruling upper crust of the military and telling everybody that he knew very well how the officer lords stuffed their faces. It’s worse than when there was indentured servitude. He said that it had not been like that in the military before. That, as his grandpa at home says - living in retirement on a reserved portion of the family farm - officers as late as in the 'sixty-six war were sharing their chicken and bread with the soldiers. His wailing had no end, until at last Švejk judged it good to praise the state of the military in the current war."
"Švejk šel tedy napřed, oddán do vůle boží, ale stále mu něco říkalo, že tam studna musí být, a taky ho nikterak nepřekvapilo, že tam byla.

There was even a pump, and when they reached it, Schweik pumped yellow water, so he could solemnly say, ""Here's the iron water, Lieutenant.""","Schweik went on in front, commending himself to the will of God. But he had a sort of inkling that there would be a well behind the hut, and so he was not surprised to find that there was one.

Jak se můžete vůbec opovážit jít s jedem nenávisti vůči některým svatým a světicím božím do boje, když ministerstvem vojenství zavedeny byly pro posádková velitelství jezuitské exhorty pro pány důstojníky a když jsme viděli slavnost vojenského vzkříšení. Rozumíte mně dobře, Baloune? Chápete, že vy vlastně provádíte něco proti slavnému duchu naší slavné armády? Jako s tím svatým Josefem, o kterým jste se zmínil, že jeho obrázek nesměl viset u vás ve světnici. Vždyť on je, Baloune, vlastně patronem všech těch, kteří se chtějí dostat z vojny. On byl tesařem, a znáte přece heslo ‚Koukejme, kde tesař nechal díru‘. Kolik lidí už šlo s tím heslem do zajetí – vidouce nezbytí, když obklíčeni ze všech stran, hleděli zachránit nikoliv snad sebe z egoistického stanoviska, nýbrž sebe jako člena armády, aby potom, až přijdou ze zajetí, mohli říct císaři pánu: My jsme zde a čekáme na další rozkaz! Rozumíte tedy tomu, Baloune?“","The one-year-old volunteer intervened: ""With the blasphemy, Baloun, and the non-confession of all the saints and saints, you have done badly, because you must know that our Austrian army has been a purely Catholic army for years, with the greatest example in our Supreme Military Lord. . How dare you go into battle with the poison of hatred against some saints and saints of God, when the Ministry of Military established Jesuit exhorts for the lordship officers for the garrison headquarters and when we saw the celebration of the military resurrection. Do you understand me well, Balloon? Do you understand that you are actually doing something against the glorious spirit of our glorious army? Like the one St. Joseph you mentioned that his picture wasn't allowed to hang in your living room. After all, he is, Baloune, actually the patron of all those who want to get out of the war. He was a carpenter, and you know the motto 'Let's see where the carpenter left the hole'. How many people had already been captured by the slogan - seeing the necessity, when surrounded on all sides, they sought not to save themselves from a selfish point of view, but themselves as a member of the army, so that when they came out of captivity they could say to the emperor: We are here and we are waiting for the next order! Do you understand that, Baloun? ”","They returned after less than half an hour, with three pigs tied up by their hind legs, the squalling family of a Ruthenian peasant, from whom the pigs had been requisitioned, and the fat military doctor from the Red Cross hut.

The controversy came to a head in front of the staff carriage, when the military doctor began to tell Captain Sagner in downright terms that the pigs were reserved for the Red Cross hospital, while the peasant flatly contradicted this and demanded that the pigs should be restored to him, as they were his only property and he certainly could not let them go at the price which had been paid him.","The one-year volunteer mixed himself into the conversation: “With the blaspheming, Baloun, and not acknowledging all the saints, male and female, you decidedly served yourself badly, because you must know that our Austrian army has for years been a strictly Catholic army, having the most brilliant example in our supreme military lord. How can you even dare to go to battle with the poison of hate toward some saints of God, male or female, when Jesuit exhortations have been instituted for garrison commands by the Ministry of Military Affairs for the officer gentlemen and since we had seen the ceremony of military resurrection. Do you understand me well, Baloun? Do you comprehend that you are actually carrying out something against the famous spirit of our glorious army? Like with that Saint Joseph whom you have mentioned saying that his picture was not allowed to be hanging by you in the living room at your house. Look Baloun, he is actually the patron of all those who want to skip from the army at war. He was a carpenter, and I’m sure you know the byword ‘Let’s see where the carpenter has left a hole.’ How many people have already gone into captivity with this byword — having seen the inevitability of it when surrounded on all sides, they were looking to save themselves not from an egoistic point of view, but themselves as members of the army so that afterwards, when they come back from captivity, they could tell the Lord Emperor : We are here and we are waiting for the next order!

On the training ground he used to tell us: ‘When there is ‘attention’, then you must be bugging your eyes out like a tomcat does when he is shitting into chopped straw.’ But otherwise he was a very nice man. Once on Baby Jesus’ birthday he’d gone crazy, bought a whole wagon of coconuts for the whole company, and since that time I’ve known how brittle bayonets are. Half the company broke their bayonets against the nuts and our Lieutenant Colonel had the whole company locked up, we were not allowed out of the garrison for three months, Mister lieutenant was under house arrest . . .”"

He began to talk to Schweik completely at random, explaining to him that at home he had a pillar box from Heligoland, and that as soon as he had passed his matriculation he had gone to play billiards, and had not raised his cap to his form master. And after each remark he inquired: ""See what I mean?""",On the street it went into Lieutenant Dub’s head again because it was very steaming hot. He was telling Švejk the most varied pieces of nonsense without there being any connections among them. He was speaking about the fact that he had a postage stamp from Helgoland at home and that right away upon completing the final examination they went to play billiards and did not greet the homeroom professor.

""","He bowed his head over the dust of the highway, but after this interval of abasement, he exclaimed with new fervour : ""Soldiers, keep up your spirits! Left, right; left, right; left, right-After which he sank back on to the haversack of Chodounsky, the telephone operator, and slept soundly till they reached Turowa Wolska, where, at Lieutenant Lukash's orders, they helped him to his feet and lifted him down from the cart.","And as if Lieutenant Dub had heard, he started suddenly hurling into the dust of the road as he had his head hung low, and when he was done puking he still yelled out: “Soldiers, forward,” then he collapsed again onto Choudounský’s back-pack and slept all the way to Turowa-Wolska, where at last they stood him up on his feet and took him off the cart on the order of Senior Lieutenant Lukáš who had a very long and difficult conversation with him, before Lieutenant Dub came to out of it all to the point that at last he was able to proclaim: “Logically judged, I committed a silliness which I will make up for in the face of the enemy.”"

"Nadporučík Lukáš se mimoděk usmál tomu ‚nějank‘ a Švejk dál vyprávěl: „Poslušně hlásím, pane obrlajtnant, že ten náš obrst byl půl vaší vejšky, nosil plnovous jako kníže Lobkovic, takže vypadal jako vopice, a když se rozčílil, vyskakoval dvakrát tak vysoko, jak byl sám vysokej, takže jsme mu říkali kaučukovej dědek. Tenkrát byl nějakej První máj a my jsme měli berajčaft, a von k nám držel předtím večer na nádvoří velikou řeč, že proto zejtra musíme vostat všichni v kasárnách a nehnout se ven, abychom mohli na nejvyšší rozkaz, v případě potřeby, všechnu tu socialistickou bandu postřílet. Proto taky, kterej voják má dneska přesčas a nevrátí se do kasáren a natáhne to až na druhej den, ten že proved zemězradu, poněvadž takovej vožralej chlap netrefí ani jednoho člověka, když budou salvy, a ještě bude střílet do vzduchu. Tedy ten jednoročák Železný vrátil se do cimry a povídá, že měl přeci jen kaučukovej dědek dobrej nápad. Dyť vono je to celkem pravda, zejtra přece nikoho do kasáren nepustějí, tak je nejlepší vůbec nepřijít, a taky to, poslušně hlásím, pane obrlajtnant, uskutečnil jako jedno víno. Ale ten obrst Fliedler, to vám byl taková potvora mizerná, dej mu pámbu nebe, že chodil druhej den po Praze a hledal někoho, kdo se vodvážil z našeho regimentu vylézt z kasáren, a někde u Prašný brány potkal taky šťastně Železnýho a hned na něho spustil: ‚Já ti tám, já ti náučím, já ti dvakrát oslatím!‘ Řekl mu toho ještě víc a spakoval ho s sebou do kasáren a po celý cestě mu říkal leccos vošklivýho, výhružnýho a ptal se ho pořád, jak se jmenuje. ‚Šélesnej, Šelesny, ty to odsrat, já rát, še chytit, já ti ukášat den ersten Mai. Šélesny, Šélesny, ty bejt můj, závžit, fajn závžit!‘ Železnýmu už to bylo všechno jedno. Tak jak šli přes Poříč, kolem Rozvařilů, Železný skočil do průjezdu a ztratil se mu průchodem a zkazil kaučukovýmu dědkovi tu velikou radost, až ho bude sázet do arestu. Obrsta to tak rozčililo, že mu utek, že ze vzteku zapomněl, jak se ten jeho delikvent jmenuje, poplet si to, a když přišel do kasáren, začal skákat do stropu, strop byl nízkej, a ten, co měl bataliónku, divil se, proč dědek mluví najednou lámaně česky a křičí: ‚Méděnej závšít, Méděnej né závšít, Ólófěnej závšít, Cínofej závšít!‘ A takhle dědek trápil den ze dne a ptal se pořád, jestli už chytli Měděnýho, Olověnýho a Cínovýho, a taky dal vyrukovat celej regiment, ale oni už Železnýho, vo kterým se to všeobecně vědělo, dali na marodku, poněvadž byl zubní technik. Až takhle jednou vod našeho regimentu podařilo se jednomu probodnout jednoho dragouna v hospodě u Bucků, kterej mu chodil za holkou, a tu nás seřadili do čtverce, museli vyjít všichni, i marodka, kdo byl moc marod, toho dva drželi. Tak taky nebylo to nic platný, musel Železný vyrukovat na dvůr a tam nám četli rozkaz po regimentu asi v tom smyslu, že dragouni jsou taky vojáci a že je zakázáno je probodávat, protože jsou to naši kriegskamaraden. Jeden jednoročák to překládal a náš obrst koukal jako tygr. Napřed prošel před frontou, potom zas šel dozadu, obcházel čtverec, a najednou objevil Železnýho, který byl jako hora, takže to, pane obrlajtnant, bylo strašně komický, když ho přitáh dovnitř čtverce. Jednoročák přestal překládat a náš obrst začal vyskakovat před Železným, jako když pes doráží na kobylu, a přitom řval: „Ták ty mně neujít, ty mně nejít nikam neutéct, teď zas žíkat, žeš Šélesný, a já furt žíkat Médený, Cínofý, Olófěný, von je Šélesný, a von je ten parchant Šélesný, já ti náučím Olófěný, Cínofý, Médený, ty Mistvieh, du Schwein, du Šélesný!‘ Pak mu napařil za to měsíc, ale potom se mu ňák za čtrnáct dní rozbolavějí zuby, a von si vzpomněl, že Železný je zubní technik, tak ho dal přivést z arestu na marodku a chtěl si dát vod něho vytrhnout zub, a Železný mu ho trhal asi půl hodiny, takže dědka asi třikrát vomejvali, ale dědek ňák zkrot a vodpustil Železnýmu těch druhejch čtrnáct dní. To je tedy tak, pane obrlajtnant, když představenej zapomene na jméno svýho podřízenýho, ale podřízenej na jméno svýho představenýho nesmí nikdy zapomenout, jako nám právě říkal ten pan obrst, že ani po letech nezapomeneme, že jsme měli jednou obrsta Fliedlera. – Nebylo to snad příliš dlouhé, pane obrlajtnant?“","Lieutenant Lukáš inadvertently smiled at the 'man', and Švejk continued to say: as he was tall himself, so we called him a rubber grandfather. There was a May Day at the time, and we had a berajaft, and he had made a big speech out in the courtyard before that night, so tomorrow we all have to get in the barracks and not move out so that we can have all the socialist gang at the highest order, if necessary. shoot. Therefore, which soldier has overtime today and will not return to the barracks and will not make it until the next day, that he will carry out treason, because such a drunken guy will not hit a single person when there are volleys, and he will still shoot in the air. So the one-year-old Železný returned to the room and said that he had a good idea after his rubber grandfather. It is quite true, they will not let anyone into the barracks tomorrow, so it is best not to come at all, and I obediently report this, Mr. Lieutenant, as one wine. But that flied Fliedler, it was such a lousy monster for you, give him a memorial to heaven that he was walking the next day in Prague looking for someone who dared to climb out of our barracks from our regiment, and somewhere near the Powder Gate he also met Železný happily and immediately he said, 'I will teach you, I will teach you, I will give you twice!' 'Cheese, Cheese, you suck, I count to catch you, I'll show you the day ersten Mai. Schelen, Schelen, you be mine, to weigh, fine to weigh! As they passed through Poříč, past Rozvařilů, Železný jumped into the passage and got lost in the passage, ruining the rubber grandfather's great joy when he put him in arrest. He was so upset that he escaped that he had forgotten the name of his delinquent, confused it, and when he arrived at the barracks, he began to jump into the ceiling, the ceiling was low, and the one with the battalion wondered, why the old man suddenly speaks broken Czech and shouts: 'Copper hung up, Copper not hung up, Olofnee hung up, Zinopheus hung up, Zinophea hung up!' regiment, but they already put Zelezny, in whom it was generally known, on the mourning, because he was a dental technician. Only once in the waters of our regiment did one manage to stab one dragoon in a pub near the Bucks, who went to see his girl, and here they put us in a square, everyone had to come out, even the marauder, who was very maraud, kept the two. It was also not valid, Železný had to come to court and there they read an order from the regiment, probably in the sense that dragoons are also soldiers and that it is forbidden to pierce them, because they are our kriegskamaraden. One year old man translated it and our coat looked like a tiger. First he walked in front of the front, then he went back again, circling the square, and suddenly discovered Iron, who was like a mountain, so that, Lieutenant, it was terribly comical to pull him inside the square. The one-year-old stopped translating and our coat began to jump in front of Železný, as when a dog arrives at a mare, and at the same time he shouted: ""Out is the Crazy, and out is the bastard the Crazy, I'll teach you Olophene, Tin, the Copper, you Mistvieh, du Schwein, du Crazy!"" von remembered that Železný was a dental technician, so he had him brought out of arrest and wanted to have a tooth ripped out of him, and Železný tore him for about half an hour, so his grandfather was vomited about three times, but the old man somehow tamed and let Železný the other fortnight. That's right, Mr. Lieutenant, if the superior forgets the name of his subordinate, but the subordinate must never forget the name of his superior, as the baptism has just told us, that even after years we will not forget that we once had a baptism of Fliedler. ""Wasn't that too long, Lieutenant?""","""Beg to report, sir,"" said Schweik apologetically, ""I used to serve under a Colonel Flieder von Boomerang, or something like that, and he was just about half your height.","Senior Lieutenant Lukáš involuntarily smiled at the ‘something like that’ and Švejk kept on relating: “I dutifully report, Senior Lieutenant, Sir, that the Colonel of ours was half your height, wore a full beard like the duke Lobkovic so that he looked like a monkey, and when he’d get upset, he was jumping twice as high as he himself was tall so that we used to call him the old India rubber geezer. Back then there was some May Day and we were on alert, and the night before he was treating us to a big speech in the court-yard, saying that the reason why the next day we all had to stay in the garrison, and not even make a move to the outside, was for us to be able to shoot in response to the highest level order in case of need and mow down the whole socialist pack. That is also why whichever soldier had an overtime pass today and didn’t return to the garrison and stretched it over to the next day, he, they said, would have committed treason against the homeland because such a drunk guy wouldn’t hit even one man when the salvos were being fired, and what’s more, he’d be shooting in the air. Then the one-year volunteer Železný returned to the room and said that the old India rubber geezer did have a good idea, after all. Look, it is largely true, tomorrow they clearly won’t let anybody into the garrison so it is best not to come at all, and he, I dutifully report, also implemented that as smoothly as downing a glass of wine. But that Colonel Fliedler, let me tell you, was such a miserable miscreant - let him pass to heaven, Lord God - that he was walking about Praha the next day and was looking for anybody from among our Regiment who had dared to crawl out of the garrison, and luckily he also ran into Železný somewhere by the Powder Tower and immediately let him have it: ‘I gif it to yoo, I yoo teach, I sveeten it for yoo tvice!’ He told him much more and bagged him and brought him to the garrison and for the rest of the journey was telling him many an ugly, threatening thing and constantly kept asking him what his name was. Ihrony, Ihronlike, you get shitslammed for it, I glat zat I to catch, I you schaw the May Day. Ihronlike, Ihronlike, yoo to be maayn, lohck up, fine lohck up!’ To Železný it didn’t make any difference anymore. So, as they walked down the Poríc Street, past the Rozvarilu buffet, Železný jumped into the carriage drive-through arcade and shook him off through a passage-way and spoiled the old India rubber geezer’s great joy he’d have when putting him in the brig. The Colonel got so upset by the fact that he gave him the slip that on account of his anger he forgot what his delinquent’s name was, mixed it up, and when he arrived at the garrison he started jumping up to the ceiling, the ceiling was low, and the one who had the battalion duty officer watch was wondering why the geezer was all of a sudden speaking broken Czech and was screaming: ‘Kopperlike, lohck up, Kopperlike, nah lohck up, Lehdlike, lohck up, Teehnlike lohck up!’ And the geezer was tormenting them in this way one day after another and kept asking constantly whether they had yet caught Kopperlike, Lehdlike, and Teehnlike, and also had them bring out the whole regiment, but they had put Železný, of whom it was already universally known, into sickbay because he was a dental technician. Until this one time a guy from our regiment managed in the pub U Bucku, At the Bootsek’s to pierce a hole through a light Dragoon cavalry soldier who was going after his girl and talking her up, and here they had us stand in the square formation, all had to come out, even the sickbay, two guys were holding whoever was too sick. So then it was to no avail , Železný had to come out into the yard and there they were reading us the Regimental order in the approximate vein that dragoons are also soldiers and that it is forbidden to be piercing holes through them because they are our comrades-at-arms and war pals. The one one-year volunteer was translating it and our Colonel was gawking like a tiger. First he strolled past the front, then again he went to the rear, he was walking around the square, and all of a sudden he discovered Železný who was like a mountain of a man, so that, Senior Lieutenant, Sir, it was very comical when he dragged him into the center of the square formation. The one-year-timer stopped translating and our Colonel started jumping up in front of Železný like when a dog is pestering a mare, and he was hollering while doing it: ‘Zoh you me not slip, you me nah go novehr eeskape, now again be zaying, dat yoo’re Ihronlike, and me all time zay Kopperlike, Teehnlike, Lehdlike, he Ihronlike, and he, dat urchin, is Ihronlike , I teech yoo Lehdlike, Teehnlike, Kopperlike, you hunk of barnyard crap, you pig, you Ihronlike!’ Then he slammed him with a month for it, but then again in about two weeks somehow his teeth started aching, and he remembered that Železný was a dental technician so he had them bring him from the brig to the sickbay and wanted to have him pull a tooth, and Železný was pulling it out for him for about a half an hour so that they had to be sponging the geezer down about three times to have him come to, but the geezer had gotten subdued somehow and forgave Železný the second two weeks. So that’s the way it is Senior Lieutenant, Sir, when a superior forgets the name of his subordinate, but as the very Colonel was telling us, the subordinate must never forget the name of his superior, saying that even years later we wouldn’t forget that once upon a time we used to have Colonel Fliedler. — Wasn’t it perhaps too long, Senior Lieutenant, Sir?”"
"„Neslevíš?“ otázal se Švejk, „tak já ti to vysvětlím ještě jednou. Tady si slyšel, že se musíš držet podle toho, jakej duch panuje v armádě, že budeš věřit v svatýho Josefa, a když budeš vobklíčenej vod nepřátelů, že budeš koukat, kde tesař nechal díru, abysi zachránil sebe pro císaře pána, pro nový vojny. Teď tomu snad rozumíš a uděláš dobře, když se nám vyzpovídáš trochu důkladněji, jaký si ty nemravnosti páchal na tý mlejnici, ne ale abys potom vypravoval něco podobnýho, jako je v té anekdotě vo té děvečce, která se šla zpovídat k panu faráři a potom, když už různý hříchy pověděla, začala se stydět a řekla, že každou noc páchala nemravnosti. To se ví, že jak tohle pan farář uslyšel, hned mu začaly téct sliny z papuly a řek: ‚No, nestyď se, milá dcero, já jsem přec na místě božím, a vypravuj mně pěkně dopodrobna vo svejch nemravnostech.‘ A vona se mu tam dala do pláče, že se stydí, že je to taková hrozná nemravnost, a von ji zas upozorňoval, že je otec duchovní. Konečně vona po dlouhým zdráhání začala s tím, že se vždycky svlíkla a vlezla si do postele. A zas z ní nemoh dostat ani slovo a jen se ještě víc rozeřvala. Von tedy zas, aby se nestyděla, že von je člověk hříšná nádoba vod svý přirozenosti, ale milost boží že je neskonalá. Vona se tedy vodhodlala a s pláčem povídala: ‚Když jsem si teda lehla svlečená do postele, tak jsem si počala vybírat špínu mezi prsty u nohou a čichala jsem k tomu.‘ To byla tedy ta celá její nemravnost. Já ale doufám, Baloune, žes tohle na mlejnici nedělal a že nám povíš něco vopravdovějšího, nějakou skutečnou nemravnost.“","""Aren't you relieved?"" Schweik asked, ""then I'll explain it to you one more time. Here you heard that you had to follow the spirit of the army, that you would believe in St. Joseph, and that if you were surrounded by enemy waters, that you would watch where the carpenter left a hole to save yourself for the emperor, for a new war. . Now you understand and do it well, if you tell us a little more thoroughly what you did to the messes at the mill, but not to tell you something like the anecdote in the girl who went to confess to the pastor and then when she had already said various sins, she became ashamed and said that she had committed immorality every night. It is known that as the pastor heard this, saliva immediately began to flow from his papule and he said, 'Well, don't be ashamed, dear daughter, I am in God's place, and tell me in great detail in your immorality.' she cried to him that she was ashamed that it was such a terrible immorality, and von warned her that her father was spiritual. Finally, after a long reluctance, she began to undress and climb into bed. And again, he couldn't get a word out of her, and she just broke up. So, again, let him not be ashamed that von is a sinful vessel of the waters of his nature, but the grace of God is infinite. So Vona chose and cried, saying, 'So when I lay down undressed in bed, I started picking up dirt between my toes and sniffing for it.' So that was all her immorality. But I hope, Baloun, that you didn't do this at the mill and that you would tell us something more real, some real immorality. ""","The controversy came to a head in front of the staff carriage, when the military doctor began to tell Captain Sagner in downright terms that the pigs were reserved for the Red Cross hospital, while the peasant flatly contradicted this and demanded that the pigs should be restored to him, as they were his only property and he certainly could not let them go at the price which had been paid him.","“You won’t let up?” asked Švejk, “So I am going to explain it to you one more time. Here you heard that you have to keep up according to whatever spirit is dominating in the army, that you will believe in Saint Joseph, and that when you are surrounded by enemies you’ll be looking for where the carpenter has left a hole so that you would save yourself for the Lord Emperor, for new wars. Now perhaps you understand it and will do well if you confess to us a little more thoroughly what immoralities you used to commit at the mill, but better not be telling us something similar to that joke about the farm girl who had gone to confess to the father priest and then, when she had already told various sins, she started being embarrassed and said that she was committing immoralities every night. Don’t you know it, as soon as the priest heard it drool started oozing out of his fat mouth and he said: ‘Well, don’t feel embarrassed dear daughter, I am in God’s place after all and do tell me nicely about your immoralities in great detail.’ And she started crying on him in there saying that she was embarrassed, that it was such horrible immorality, and he in turn was putting her on notice that he was the spiritual father. At last, after a long time of hesitating she began by saying that she would always undress and crawl into bed. And again he could not get a word out of her and she only started bawling more. He was then again saying for her not to feel embarrassed, that man was a sinful vessel by his nature, but that divine mercy was without ceasing. She then found the resolve and weeping she was saying: ‘When I laid myself naked in the bed, I started picking the dirt from between my toes then and I was sniffing it.’ That was then her whole immorality. But I hope, Baloun, that you did not used to do this at the mill and that you’ll tell us something more genuine, some real immorality.”"

"„Celkem vzato mě naprosto nepřekvapilo vystoupení Itálie. Čekal jsem to již před třemi měsíci. Je jisté, že Itálie značně zpyšněla poslední dobou, následkem vítězné války s Tureckem o Tripolis. Kromě toho příliš spoléhá se na své loďstvo i na náladu obyvatelstva v našich přímořských zemích a v jižním Tyrolsku. Ještě před válkou mluvil jsem o tom s naším okresním hejtmanem, aby naše vláda nepodceňovala iredentistické hnutí na jihu. Dal mně též úplně za pravdu, poněvadž každý prozíravý člověk, kterému záleží na zachování této říše, musel již dávno předpokládat, kam bychom dospěli s přílišnou shovívavostí vůči takovým živlům. Pamatuji se dobře, že asi před dvěma lety jsem prohlásil v rozmluvě s panem okresním hejtmanem, že Itálie, bylo to v době balkánské války při aféře našeho konzula Prohasky, čeká na nejbližší příležitost nás zákeřně napadnout. – A teď to máme!“ vykřikl takovým hlasem, jako by se s ním všichni hádali, ačkoliv všichni přítomní aktivní důstojníci si při jeho řeči mysleli, aby jim ten civilista žvanil vlezl na záda.","""Overall, I was not completely surprised by the performance of Italy. I expected it three months ago. It is certain that Italy has become very proud in recent times, as a result of the victorious war with Turkey over Tripoli. In addition, it relies too much on its fleet and on the mood of the population in our coastal countries and in South Tyrol. Even before the war, I talked to our district governor so that our government would not underestimate the irredentist movement in the south. He also proved me right, because every prudent man who cares about the preservation of this realm must have long assumed where we would have come with too much indulgence towards such elements. I remember very well that about two years ago I stated in an interview with the district governor that Italy, it was during the Balkan war during the affair of our consul Prohaska, is waiting for the next opportunity to attack us insidiously.

Moreover, she is placing too much reliance on her fleet and on the feeling among the population in our Adriatic areas and in south Tyrol. Before the war I used to tell our district chief of police that our government ought not to underestimate the irredentist movement in the south. He quite agreed with me, because every farsighted man who is concerned about the preservation of this empire must long ago have realized what would happen to us if we were to show too much indulgence toward such elements. I well remember that about two years ago, in the course of a conversation with our district of police, I stated that Italy was only waiting for the next opportunity of making a treacherous attack on us.

I was expecting it already three months ago. It is certain that Italy’s vain pride had grown significantly as a consequence of the victorious war with Turkey over Tripoli.

It was still before the war when I was talking about it with our county Captain, saying for our government not to underestimate the irredentis8 movement in the south. He also totally agreed with me because every human with foresight, who cares about the survival of this Empire, had to know long ago already where we would end up being excessively lenient toward such elements.

"„Dyž já nejsem pro vojnu dělanej,“ zahořekoval Baloun, ‚já jsem pravda nenažranej, nedožranej, poněvadž jsem vytrženej z pořádnýho života. Vono je to u nás v rodu.

Doma si vzpomenu po obědě, že bych chtěl ještě něco zakusit. Jdu do komory, uříznu si kus masa, pošlu si pro džbán piva a splivnu dvě kila uzenýho. Měl jsem doma starýho čeledína Vomela a ten mě vždycky napomínal, abych jen tak nepejchnul, necpal se, že von pamatuje, jak mu jeho dědeček vypravoval dávno vo jednom takovým nedožerovi. A potom když byla nějaká vojna, že se nerodilo nic po celejch osum let a že pekli chleba ze slámy a z toho, co zůstalo z lněnýho semene; a to byl svátek, když mohli do mlíka nadrobit trochu tvarohu, když nebylo chleba.

Vono is in our family. Daddy's father, he was betting in a pub in Protivín that he was eating fifty burritos and two loaves of bread, and he won. I once ate four geese and two bowls of dumplings with cabbage. At home, I remember after lunch that I wanted to experience something else. I go to the chamber, cut a piece of meat, send a pitcher of beer and spit two pounds of smoked meat. I had an old groom, Vomela, at home, and he always admonished me not to get mad, not to mind that he remembered how his grandfather had told him a long time ago in one such devil. And then when there was a war, that nothing had been born for eight years and that they had baked bread from straw and what was left of flaxseed; and it was a feast when they could put some curd into the milk when there was no bread. And the farmer, as soon as the misery ensued, died within a week, because his stomach was not accustomed to such peasant misery. ""","""I was never meant to be in the army,"" lamented Baloun. ""I know I'm always thinking about food and I can never get enough of it, but that's because I've been dragged away from the life I'm used to. And it runs in our family, too. My father, he's dead now, but he once made a bet that he'd eat fifty sausages at a sitting and two loaves of bread, and he won his bet. I once made a bet","“But I’m not made for the military,” Baloun wailed a bit, “I am, it’s true, insatiable, never filled, because I’ve been torn out of proper life. It’s in our clan line. My late daddy, he was betting in a pub in Protivín that he would eat fifty bacon sausages and two loaves of bread in a sitting, and he won it. I once ate four geese and two mixing bowls of dumplings with sauerkraut on a bet. At home I’ll have the idea after lunch that I’d still like to bite into something. I go into the pantry, cut a piece of meat, send for a pitcher of beer and smack down two kilos of smoked butt. I had an old stable hand at home, Vomel, and he was always reminding me not to be getting prideful, not to be stuffing myself, that he remembed how his grandpa was telling him long ago about one such bottomless glutton. And then, when there was some war, the fields bore nothing to harvest for eight whole years and he said that they would bake bread from straw and from what was left of the flax seed; and it was a holiday when they could sprinkle a little farmer’s cheese into milk when there was no bread. And that farmer, as soon as that hardship started, he died in a week because his stomach was not used to such want among farmers ."

But if he gives him out, Gloomy, eighteen hundred, so he'd rather go with him to the Combat. So they agreed, and Havlas had for some time still leaned around the Worse One who had betrayed him, and acted as if he were his best friend, and when it came to when they would put it together, he said, 'Yeah, it will be soon.

So the merchant Horejší once got this idea to like join up with the grocer Havlasa against the merchant Pošmourný, and he started negotiating with him over whether they could combine the two stores under the single firm ‘Horejší and Havlasa’. But the grocer Havlasa went immediately to the merchant Pošmourný and told him that Horejší was giving him twelve hundred for that grocery store of his and that he wanted him to go into a business pact with him. But if he, Pošmourný, gave him eighteen hundred bills he would rather make a pact with him against Horejší. So they made a deal and for still some time that Havlasa guy kept hanging around this Horejší, whom he betrayed, and he kept acting as if he were his best friend, and when the talk came around to it, as to when they would like put it together, he would say: Well, that’ll be soon already.

"„Ano, poslušně hlásím, pane obrlajtnant, polívku ze slepice, koupil jsem cibuli a pět deka nudlí. Zde je to prosím všechno. Zde je v té kapse cibule a v této jsou nudle. Sůl máme v kanceláři a pepř taky. Nezbývalo již nic jiného než koupit slepici. Šel jsem tedy za nádražím do Išatarči. Je to vlastně vesnice, jako by to nebylo žádný město, ačkoliv je tam napsáno v první ulici Išatarča vároš. Projdu jednu ulici se zahrádkami, druhou, třetí, čtvrtou, pátou, šestou, sedmou, osmou, devátou, desátou, jedenáctou, až v třinácté ulici na samém konci, kde za jedním domkem už začínaly trávníky, páslo se a procházelo stádo slepic. Šel jsem k nim a vybral jsem tu největší, nejtěžší, račte se na ni podívat, pane obrlajtnant, je to samý sádlo, nemusí se ani vohledávat a pozná se to hned na první pohled, že jí museli sypat hodně zrní. Vzal jsem ji tedy, zcela veřejně, u přítomnosti obyvatelstva, které na mne cosi maďarsky křičelo, držím ji za nohy a ptám se několika lidí, česky i německy, komu patří ta slepice, abych ji mohl od něho koupit, když vtom vyběhne z toho domku na kraji muž s ženou a počne mně napřed nadávat maďarsky a pak německy, že jsem mu ukradl za bílého dne slepici. Řekl jsem mu, aby na mne nekřičel, že jsem poslán, abych ji vám koupil, a vyprávěl jsem mu, jak se věci mají. A ta slepice, jak jsem ji držel za nohy, najednou počala mávat křídly a chtěla vyletět, a jak jsem ji jen tak lehce držel v ruce, vyzvedla mně ruku a chtěla se usadit svýmu pánovi na nose. A von hned začal křičet, že prý jsem ho slepicí fláknul přes hubu. A ta ženská něco ječela a pořád křičela na slepici ‚puta, puta, puta, puta‘. Vtom ale už nějací blbci, kteří tomu nerozuměli, přiváděli na mne patrolu, honvédy, a já jsem je sám vyzval, aby šli se mnou na bahnhofkomando, aby vyšla moje nevina jako volej nad vodu. Ale s tím panem lajtnantem, který měl tam službu, nebyla žádná řeč, ani když jsem ho prosil, aby se vás zeptal, je-li to pravda, že jste mne poslal, abych vám koupil něco dobrýho. Ještě se na mne rozkřik, abych držel hubu, že prý mně beztoho kouká z očí silná větev s dobrým provazem. Von byl patrně v nějakej moc špatnej náladě, když mně povídal, že takhle vypasenej může bejt jen voják, kerej loupí a krade. Vono prej už je na stanici víc stížností, předevčírem prej se ztratil někde vedle někomu krocan, a když jsem mu řekl, že jsme tu dobu byli ještě v Rábu, tak řekl, že taková vejmluva na něho neplatí. Tak mě poslali k vám a ještě se tam na mne rozkřikl, když jsem ho neviděl, jeden frajtr, jestli prej nevím, koho mám před sebou. Řek jsem mu, že je gefreiter, kdyby byl u myslivců, že by byl patrollführer a u dělostřelectva oberkanonier.“","""Yes, I dutifully report, Lieutenant, chicken soup, I bought an onion and five blankets of noodles. Here it is, please. There's an onion in that pocket and noodles in it. We have salt in the office and pepper too. There was nothing left but to buy a hen. So I went to the station in Ishatarchi. It is actually a village, as if it were not a city, although it is written there in the first street of Išatarča vároš. I walk down one street with gardens, the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, to the thirteenth street at the very end, where behind one house the lawns were already beginning to graze and walk. I went to them and chose the biggest, the hardest, please look at it, Lieutenant, it's the same lard, she doesn't even have to look, and you can tell at a glance that they had to pour a lot of grain on it. So I took it, quite publicly, in the presence of the population, who shouted something at me in Hungarian, I hold it by the legs and I ask a few people, Czech and German, who owns the hen, so I can buy it from him when he runs out of it. a man and a woman on the edge of the house start cursing me first in Hungarian and then in German for stealing his hen in broad daylight. I told him not to yell at me that I was sent to buy it for you, and I told him how things were. And the hen, as I held her legs, suddenly fluttered her wings and wanted to fly out, and as I held her in my hand so lightly, she lifted my hand and wanted to settle on her master's nose. And he immediately started shouting that I had slapped him across the mouth with a hen. And the woman was screaming something and still shouting at the hen 'puta, puta, puta, puta'. But then some idiots who didn't understand were bringing a patrol, a hunting party, and I myself invited them to come with me to the bahnhofkomando, so that my innocence would come out like a call over the water. But there was no talk with the lieutenant on duty there, even though I asked him to ask you if it was true that you had sent me to buy you something good. I still shouted at me to shut up that a strong branch with a good rope was supposed to look out of my eyes. Von was probably in a very bad mood when he told me that only a soldier could be grazed like this, robbing and stealing. Vono prej is already having more complaints at the station, the day before yesterday the turkey was lost somewhere next to someone, and when I told him we were still in Rab at the time, he said that such an agreement did not apply to him. So they sent me to you, and there he shouted at me when I didn't see him, one dude, if I don't know who I have in front of me. I told him he was a gefreiter, if he was with the hunters, he would be a patrollführer and with the artillery oberkanonier. ""","Lieutenant Dub wavered and said that he had asked for Schweik to be punished in the broader sense of the term and that perhaps Schweik was not capable of expressing himself properly and his answers only seemed to be impudent, insulting and lacking in respect toward his superiors.","“Yes, I dutifully report, Senior Lieutenant, Sir, a soup from a hen, I bought onion and five decagrams of noodles. Salt we have at the office and black pepper too. Nothing was left to do other than to buy a hen. I went then on the other side of the railroad station to Išatarca. It is actually a village, not quite a town, although a sign in the first street there reads Išatarca vároš. I went through the length of one street with front yard gardens, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh, the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, the eleventh, and only in the thirteenth street, at the very end of it where behind a little house the lawns were already beginning there was grazing and strutting a herd of hens. I went toward them and chose the largest, heaviest: condescend to look at it, Senior Lieutenant, Sir, it is nothing but lard, it doesn’t even have to be examined by touch and at first sight it is realized that they must had been pouring it a lot of grain. I took it then, absolutely publicly, in the presence of the local population which was screaming at me something in Hungarian, I was holding it by the legs and I was asking several people, both in Czech and German, whom did the hen belong to so that I could buy it from him, when just then out of the little house at the end ran a man with a woman and started cursing me first in Hungarian and then in German, saying that I stole a hen from him in broad white daylight. I told him to stop screaming at me, telling him that I’d been dispatched to buy it for you and I was telling him how things really were. And the hen, as I was holding it by the legs, all of a sudden started waving its wings and wanted to take off flying, and as I was holding it only lightly in my hand, it raised my arm and wanted to land on its master’s nose. And right away he started hollering that I supposedly slammed him with the hen across his beastly mouth. And the broad was squealing something and kept screaming at the hen ‘puta, puta, puta, puta.’ But just then some idiots, who didn’t understand what it was all about, were already bringing over the patrol, a Hungarian Home-Army patrol, and I challenged them to come with me to the railroad station Command Headquarters in order for my innocence to come up, like oil rises to the top of water. But there was no talking to that Mister Lieutenant who was on duty there, even when I was begging him to ask you whether it was true that you’d sent me to buy something good and tasty for you. On top of it he screamed at me to keep my trap shut, that gazing into my eyes he could see a thick branch with a good rope coming out, regardless. He was apparently in some very bad mood when he was telling me that someone so well-grazed and fattened-up could only be a soldier who robs and steals. There are, it is said, already other complaints registered at the station, the day before yesterday supposedly somewhere next door somebody’s turkey was lost, and when I said that at that time we were still in Ráb, he said that such an excuse had no currency with him and wouldn’t work. So they sent me to you and on top of it, while still there, he started screaming at me when I didn’t see him, the corporal that he is, asking whether it could be that I didn’t know whom I had in front of me. I told him that he’s a corporal that he’d be a patrol-leader if he were with the rangers, and with the artillery a chief gunner.”"

Pravá ruka je přirozeně napnuta a drží flintu tak, že palec vobjímá lauf, ostatní prsty musejí svírat pažbu na předku, a když je Schultert!, tak je flinta volně na řemenu na pravým rameni a laufmündunk nahoru a laufem nazad…“","Then it stopped for a moment and Švejk's voice was heard, satisfied and prudent: ""I learned all this in active service years ago.

When there’s Order arms! then the rifle is standing propped against the right hip. The toe of the rifle butt is directly in line with the toe tips. The right arm is naturally stretched and its hand is holding the rifle so that the thumb is hugging the barrel, the rest of the fingers must be gripping the front of the butt, and when there’s Shoulder arms! , then the rifle is slung loosely over the right shoulder and the mouth of the barrel pointing upward and the barrel to the back . . .”"

Ten že jim dal k vepřové pečeni zelí z dyně a potom že jim nalil vína a řekl:","Hetman Sagner naturally felt terribly elevated above the former MUC, which cut down how many officers during his many years of study. When Dr. Welfer, the ""war doctor,"" walked past him, did not even look at him, and continued to talk to Lieutenant Lukáš about something completely insignificant that pumpkins were grown near Budapest, and Lieutenant Lukáš replied that when he was a cadet in his third year, that with several friends ""in civilian clothes"" they were in Slovakia and came to an evangelical pastor, a Slovak. And he gave them pork cabbage to roast, and he poured them wine, and said,","It was then that Dr. Welfer was sent off with the nth draft to the front. Captain Sagner, of course, felt vastly superior to this ex-medical student, and when Dr. Welfer came back from his examination of Cadet Biegler, he did not even condescend to notice him, but continued his conversation with Lieutenant Lukash on the subject of water melons.","Captain Ságner felt himself naturally terribly exalted above the former CMU, who cut up who knows how many officers in his time of long years of studies. When doctor Welfer, “wartime doctor”, passed by him, he would not even look at him and would keep on speaking with Senior Lieutenant Lukáš about something absolutely insignificant, that in Budapešt they grow gourds, to which Senior Lieutenant Lukáš would retort that when he was in the third year of the Caddy school he and several pals dressed as civilians were in Slovakia and came to an evangelical minister, a Slovak. That he gave them cabbage made of gourd to go with the pork roast and that he then poured wine for them and said:"

Some farmer Pícha had no joy on account of the visit and did not accept the eighteen crowns of compensation for the trampled five measures of field from the Army Supply Administration, and he wanted, I tell you Senior Lieutenant, Sir, to sue and he got eighteen months for it."

"„Ano,“ řekl ledabyle jednoroční dobrovolník, „systematizovaný, systematický systém při psaní dějin bataliónu. Napřed nemůžeme vyrukovat hned s velkým vítězstvím. To všechno musí jít pomalu, podle určitého plánu. Náš batalión nemůže vyhrát najednou tuhle světovou vojnu. Nihil ni si bene. Hlavní věcí je pro důkladného historika dějin, jako jsem já, udělat si zprvu plán našich vítězství. Kupříkladu zde líčím, jak náš batalión, to snad bude asi za dva měsíce, málem překročí ruské hranice, velice silně obsazené, řekněme donskými pluky nepřítele, zatímco několik nepřátelských divizí obchází naše pozice. Na první pohled se zdá, že náš batalión jest ztracen, že nás rozsekají na nudle, když vtom dá hejtman Ságner tento rozkaz po našem bataliónu: ‚Bůh nechce, abychom tu zahynuli, prchejme!‘ Náš batalión dá se tedy na útěk, ale nepřátelská divize, která nás už obešla, vidí, že se vlastně na ni ženem, počne zděšeně utíkat a padne bez výstřelu do rukou rezervám naší armády. Tím tedy vlastně celá historie našeho bataliónu začne. Z nepatrné události, abych mluvil prorocky, pane Vaňku, vyvinou se dalekosáhlé věci. Náš batalión jde od vítězství k vítězství. Zajímavé bude, jak náš batalión přepadne spícího nepřítele, k čemuž ovšem je potřeba slohu Ilustrovaného válečného zpravodaje, který vycházel u Vilímka za rusko-japonské války. Náš batalión přepadne tábor spících nepřátel. Každý náš voják vyhledá si jednoho nepřítele, vší silou vrazí mu bodák do prsou. Znamenitě nabroušený bajonet vjede jako do másla a jen tu a tam zapraská žebro, spící nepřátelé trhají celým tělem, na okamžik vypoulejí udivené, ale již nic nevidoucí oči, zachroptějí a natáhnou se. Spícím nepřátelům objevují se na rtech krvavé sliny, tím je věc odbyta a vítězství je na straně našeho bataliónu. Nebo ještě lepší to bude asi tak za tři měsíce, to náš batalión zajme ruského cara. O tom si ale povíme, pane Vaňku, až později, mezitím si musím připravit do zásoby malé epizody, svědčící o bezpříkladné hrdinnosti. Bude mně třeba vymyslit si zcela nové válečné termíny. Jeden jsem si již vymyslil, budu psát o obětavé odhodlanosti našeho mužstva, prošpikovaného střepinami granátů. Výbuchem nepřátelské miny přijde jeden z našich četařů, řekněme dvanácté nebo třinácté kumpanie, o hlavu. – Á propos,“ řekl jednoroční dobrovolník, uhodiv se do hlavy, „málem bych zapomněl, pane rechnungsfeldvébl, čili po občansku řečeno, pane Vaněk, musíte mně zaopatřit seznam všech šarží. Jmenujte mně nějakého šikovatele od dvanácté kumpanie. – Houska? Dobrá, tak tedy Houska přijde o hlavu s tou minou, hlava mu odletí, tělo však udělá ještě několik kroků, namíří si a sestřelí ještě nepřátelský aeroplán. To se samo sebou rozumí, že ohlasy těchto vítězství musí být v budoucnosti oslaveny v rodinném kruhu v Schönbrunnu. Rakousko má velice mnoho bataliónů, ale jediný batalión, to je náš, který se vyznamená, že jedině kvůli němu uspořádá se malá rodinná intimní slavnost císařského domu. Představuji si to tak, jak vidíte v mých poznámkách, že arcivévodská rodina Marie Valérie přesídlí kvůli tomu z Wallsee do Schönbrunnu. Slavnost je čistě intimní a koná se v sále vedle mocnářovy ložnice, kteráž je osvětlena bílými voskovicemi, neboť jak je známo, u dvora nemilují elektrických žárovek kvůli krátkému spojení, vůči kterému jest stařičký mocnář zaujat. O šesté hodině večerní začíná slavnost ku cti a chvále našeho bataliónu. V tu dobu uvedeni jsou vnukové Jeho Veličenstva do sálu, jenž vlastně náleží ke komnatám zvěčnělé císařovny. Teď je otázka, kdo bude přítomen kromě císařské rodiny. Musí tam být a bude tam generální adjutant mocnáře hrabě Paar. Poněvadž při takových rodinných a intimních hostinách bývá občas někomu mdlo, čímž ovšem nemyslím, že se hrabě Paar snad poblije, je vyžadována přítomnost osobního lékaře, dvorního rady dr. Kerzla. Kvůli pořádku, aby si snad dvorní lokajové nedovolili nějaké důvěrnosti ku dvorním dámám přítomným na hostině, objevuje se nejvyšší hofmistr baron Lederer, komoří hrabě Bellegarde a vrchní dvorní dáma hraběnka Bombellesová, která hraje mezi dvorními dámami stejnou úlohu jako madam v bordelu u Šuhů. Když se vznešené panstvo shromáždilo, byl o tom uvědomen císař, který se pak objevil v průvodu svých vnuků, posadil se za stůl a pronesl přípitek na počest našeho maršbataliónu. Po něm se ujala slova arcivévodkyně Marie Valérie, která se zejména pochvalně zmiňuje o vás, pane rechnungsfeldvéble. Ovšem že podle mých poznámek náš batalión utrpí těžké a citelné ztráty, poněvadž batalión bez mrtvých není žádným bataliónem. Bude třeba ještě zhotovit nový článek o našich mrtvých. Dějiny bataliónů nesmí se skládat jenom ze suchých fakt o vítězství, kterých mám už napřed asi dvaačtyřicet poznamenáno. Vy například, pane Vaňku, padnete u malé říčky a tadyhle Baloun, který na nás tak divně čumí, ten zahyne docela jinou smrtí než kulí, šrapnelem nebo granátem. Bude uškrcen lasem vymrštěným z nepřátelského aeroplánu právě v tom okamžiku, kdy bude požírat oběd svého obrlajtnanta Lukáše.“","""Yes,"" said a one-year-old volunteer, ""a systematic, systematic system in writing the history of the battalion. First of all, we can't win right away with a big victory. It all has to go slowly, according to a plan. Our battalion can't suddenly win this world war. You don't have to. The main thing for a thorough history historian like me is to make a plan of our victories first. For example, I am describing how our battalion, perhaps in about two months, will almost cross the Russian border, very heavily occupied, say by enemy Don regiments, while several enemy divisions are bypassing our positions. At first glance, it seems that our battalion is lost, that we are chopped into noodles, when Captain Ságner gives this order to our battalion: 'God does not want us to perish here, let us flee!' So our battalion flees, but the enemy the division, which has already bypassed us, sees that, in fact, the woman is starting to run away in horror and falls without a shot into the hands of the reserves of our army. So that's where the whole history of our battalion begins. From a small event, to speak prophetically, Mr. Vanek, far-reaching things will develop. Our battalion goes from victory to victory. It will be interesting how our battalion attacks the sleeping enemy, which, of course, requires the style of the Illustrated War Reporter, who was published by Vilímek during the Russo-Japanese War. Our battalion will attack a camp of sleeping enemies. Each of our soldiers searches for one enemy, he stabs him with a bayonet into his chest. The beautifully sharpened bayonet enters like butter, and only here and there does the rib crack, the sleeping enemies tearing their whole bodies, their eyes bulging for a moment, but their eyes invisible, grunting and stretching. Bloody saliva appears on the lips of sleeping enemies, so the thing is sold and victory is on the side of our battalion. Or even better, it will be in about three months, our battalion will capture the Russian Tsar. But we'll talk about that, Mr. Vanek, and later, in the meantime, I have to stock up on a small episode, which testifies to unprecedented heroism. I will have to come up with completely new war terms. I have already come up with one, I will write about the selfless determination of our team, riddled with shrapnel. One of our sergeants, say the twelfth or thirteenth company, loses his head with an explosion of an enemy mine. ""By the way,"" said the one-year-old volunteer, he struck his head, ""I almost forgot, Mr. rechnungsfeldvébl, that is, civically speaking, Mr. Vanek, you must provide me with a list of all batches. Name me a bully from the twelfth company. - A bun? Okay, so Houska loses his head with the mine, his head flies off, but his body takes a few more steps, aims and shoots down an enemy airplane. It goes without saying that the responses to these victories must be celebrated in the future in the family circle in Schönbrunn. Austria has a lot of battalions, but the only battalion is ours, which means that only a small family intimate party of the imperial house will be organized because of it. I imagine, as you can see in my remarks, that the Archduke's family, Marie Valérie, will move from Wallsee to Schönbrunn because of this. The celebration is purely intimate and takes place in the hall next to the monarch's bedroom, which is lit by white wax candles, because it is known that they do not love electric light bulbs at court due to the short circuit that the old monarch is interested in. At six o'clock in the evening, the celebration begins in honor and praise of our battalion. At that time, His Majesty's grandchildren are ushered into a hall that actually belongs to the chambers of the immortalized empress. Now the question is who will be present besides the imperial family. There must be, and will be, the Adjutant General of Count Paar. Because at such family and intimate feasts, someone is sometimes fainting, which, however, I do not think that Count Paar will be overwhelmed, the presence of a personal doctor, the court council of Dr. Kerzla. For the sake of order, so that the court butlers would not allow themselves any intimacy to the ladies present at the feast, Barefoot Chief Baron Lederer, Countess Bellegarde and Countess Lady Bombelles, who played the same role as the ladies in the brothel near Shuh, appeared. When the noble lords gathered, the emperor was informed of this, who then appeared in the procession of his grandchildren, sat down at the table, and made a toast in honor of our marshalbation. After him, the Archduchess Marie Valérie took the floor, who especially mentions you, Mr. Rechnungsfeldvéble. Of course, according to my notes, our battalion will suffer heavy and tangible losses, because a battalion without the dead is no battalion. A new article about our dead will be needed. The history of battalions must not consist only of dry facts about victory, of which I have already noted about forty-two. You, for example, Mr. Vanek, will fall by a small river, and here Baloun, who is staring at us so strangely, will die quite a different death than a bullet, shrapnel or a grenade. He will be strangled by a lasso thrown from an enemy plane at the very moment he eats his luncheon Lukáš's lunch. ""","""Yes,"" said the volunteer officer in an offhand tone, ""a systematized, systematic system for writing the history of the battalion. It's no use coming out with great victories right at the very start. The whole thing's got to take its course gradually and according to a definite plan. One battalion can't win the war right off. The important thing for a painstaking historian like me to do is first of all to draw up a general scheme of the victories we're going to win. For example, this is where I describe how our battalion, about two months from now, nearly crosses the Russian frontier, which is strongly guarded, let us say, by some regiments of Don Cossacks, while a number of enemy divisions are about to surround us by a flanking movement. At first sight, it looks as if our battalion's done for and that they'll make mincemeat of us. But then Captain Sagner issues this order to the battalion : ' It is not God's will that we should perish here; let us retreat.' So our battalion takes to its heels, but the enemy division, which has now surrounded us, sees that we're really chasing after them, and so they begin to take fright and skedaddle, so that without firing a shot they get captured by our reserves. That's where the history of our battalion really begins. From quite a trifling event, if I may speak prophetically, Sergeant, matters of great moment develop. Our battalion passes from victory to victory. It'll be interesting to see how our battalion takes the enemy by surprise while they're asleep. Each man in the battalion will pick one of the enemy and with all his might will shove his bayonet through his chest. The bayonets, with their well-ground edges, will slide in as if they were cutting butter, and only here and there you'll hear a rib cracking. The bodies of the sleeping enemy will twitch, their eyes, horrified but already sightless, will bulge, they will make gurgling noises and then grow rigid. Blood and foam will appear on the lips of the sleeping enemy and that will end the whole business. Our battalion will score a victory. Or it'll be even better, say, in about three months' time, when our battalion captures the Czar. But we'll talk about that later on, Sergeant. In the meanwhile I must lay in a stock of little incidents giving proof of unexampled bravery. Thus, I'll write about the dogged self-sacrifice of our men when they are studded with bits of hand grenade. And then, through the explosion of an enemy mine, one of our sergeants, say, of the 12th or 13th company, will have his head blown off. And, by the way,"" continued Marek, with a gesture indicating sudden remembrance, ""I nearly forgot to tell you, Sergeant, to get me a list of all the N. C. O.'s. Tell me the name of one of the sergeant-majors in the 12th company. Houska? Very well, then, Houska's going to have his head blown off by this mine. His head will fly off, but his body will go on walking for another few yards, he'll take aim and shoot down an enemy aeroplane. Of course, the royal family will have to arrange a special evening party in their own home to celebrate exploits of that kind. Quite a select affair, to be held in the apartment next to the Emperor's bedroom. The place will be lit up with candles only, because, as I expect you know, electric light is unpopular in court circles, on account of our aged monarch's prejudice against short circuits. The festivities in honour of our battalion will begin at six p. m. At that hour the grandchildren of His Royal Highness will be in bed, and after the Emperor has proposed a toast to our draft, a few words will be said by the Archduchess Marie Valerie, who will refer to you, Sergeant, in terms of approval. I tell you, Austria's got lots and lots of battalions, but ours is the only one that'll distinguish itself to that extent. Of course, from the notes I have made, it is evident that our battalion will suffer severe and irretrievable losses, because a battalion without any dead can hardly be called a battalion. A fresh article will have to be written about our losses. Victories are all very well in their way, and I've got about forty-two of 'em on tap now. But the history of the battalion has got to be something more than a string of dry facts about victories. So, as I say, there's got to be plenty of losses as well. For instance, Sergeant, you're going west by the side of a brook, and Baloun here, who's squinting at us with such a queer look in his eyes, is not going to be done in by a bullet or by shrapnel or by a bomb. No, he's going to be strangled by a lasso chucked out of an enemy aeroplane just at the moment when he's guzzling Lieutenant Lukash's lunch.","“Yes,” said the one-year volunteer carelessly, “systematized, systematic system in writing the history of the Battalion. We can’t roll out a great victory up front right away. It all has to go slowly, according to a certain plan. Our Battalion cannot win this world war at once. Nihil nisi bene, Nothing but good. The main thing for a thorough chronicler of history, like I am, is to make a plan of our victories first. For example, I’m describing here how our Battalion, this will perhaps be two months from now, almost crosses the Russian border very heavily manned, let us say, by the enemy’s Don-River-region Regiments, while several enemy divisions are getting around our positions. At the first sight it seems that our Battalion is doomed, that they will chop us to make noodles, when at that moment Captain Ságner gives this battalion-wide order: ‘God does not want us to perish here, let’s flee!’ Our Battalion then takes off running away, but the enemy division, which has already avoided us by giving us a wide berth, sees that we are actually rushing it, starts fleeing in horror and falls without a shot into the hands of our army reserves. With that the whole history of our Battalion will begin then. From an insignificant event, to put it prophetically, Mister Vanek, much farther reaching things will evolve. Our Battalion goes from victory to victory. The interesting thing will be how our Battalion ambushes the sleeping enemy, for which however the composition style needed is that of the Illustrated War Correspondent which used to be published by Vilímek during the Russo-Japanese war. Our Battalion will set upon the camp of the sleeping enemy. Each of our soldiers looks up one of the enemies, and with all might rams the bayonet into his chest. The excellently sharpened bayonet goes in like into butter and only now and then a rib will crack, the sleeping enemies’ whole bodies jerk, bugging out their amazed but no longer seeing eyes for a moment, then give a death rattling sound and come down flat. On the sleeping enemies’ lips are emerging bloody spittle, thereby the matter is finished, and the victory is on the side of our Battalion. Or, it will be better yet about three months from now when our Battalion takes the Russian Czar prisoner. But we’ll talk about that only later, Mister Vanek, in the meantime I have to prepare little episodes to keep in stock, testifying to unprecedented heroism. I will need to think up wholly new war terms. I have invented one already, I will write of the self-sacrificing determination of our rank-and-file, interlarded with grenade fragments. Through the explosion of an enemy mine one of our squad leaders, let’s say of the twelfth or thirteenth company, will lose his head. — A propos, By the way,” said the one-year volunteer, having hit himself on his head, “I would have almost forgotten Accountant Master Sergeant, Sir, or as spoken among citizens, Mister Vanek, you must get a list of the NCOs for me. Name me a quartermaster of the Twelfth Company. — Houska? Good, so then Houska will lose his head to that mine, the head will fly off, the body however will still make several steps, it will aim and still shoot down an enemy airplane. It is naturally understood that in the future the echoes of these victories must be celebrated in the family circle at Schönbrunn14. Austria has very many battalions, but only one battalion of ours will distinguish itself so that only on its account will there be organized a little intimate family party of the Imperial House. The way I imagine it, as you can see in my notes, is that the archduchy family of Marie Valérie will move from the Wallsee to Schönbrunn because of it. The celebration is of a purely intimate scale and is taking place in the hall next to the monarch’s bedroom which is lit with white wax candles because, as is known, at the court they do not love electrical bulbs on account of short circuits, against which the frail old little monarch is biased. At the sixth hour of the evening the party commences to honor and praise our Battalion. At that time the grandsons of His Majesty are escorted into the hall which actually belongs to the chambers of the immortalized Empress. Now the question is, who will be present besides the Imperial family. There must be and there will be the general aide of the monarch, Count Paar. Because at such family and intimate banquets there is now and then somebody who gets faint, by which however I don’t mean that Count Paar will puke, the presence of the personal physician, Court Counselor Doctor Kerzl is required there. On account of order, so that the court footmen would not dare to afford themselves some intimacies toward the court ladies present at the banquet, there emerges the Chief Steward of the Court, Baron Lederer, the Chamberlain, Count Bellegarde and the Chief Court Lady-in-waiting, Countess Bombelles, who plays the same role among the court ladies-in-waiting as the madam in the Šuhas’ brothel. When their exalted lordships had gathered, the Emperor was apprized of it and then appeared escorted by his grandsons, sat down at a table and proclaimed a toast to honor our march battalion. After him taking her turn spoke Archduchess Marie Valérie, who mentions you Accountant Master Sergeant, Sir, in an especially laudatory manner. However, according to my notes, our Battalion will suffer heavy and severely felt losses because a battalion without any dead is no battalion. It will be necessary still to draft a new article about our dead. The history of the battalion must not consist only of dry facts about victories from among which I have already made notes of about forty-two in advance. You, for example, Mister Vanek, will fall by a little creek and this one here, Baloun, who is gawking at us so amazed, he will perish by quite a different death rather than by a bullet, shrapnel or grenade. He will be strangled with a lasso ejected from an enemy airplane just at the moment when he is gobbling up the lunch of his Senior Lieutenant Lukáš.”"

"„ S těmi, co jsem odnesl z regimentskanclaje na batalión?“ otázal se Švejk. „Ty byly vopravdu vod toho sepsaný, vo kterým jste se mě ptal, jestli ho neznám, pane obrlajtnant. Já jsem dostal telefonogram přímo z regimentskanceláře. Voni totiž chtěli ty knížky poslat na batalionskanclaj, ale všichni tam byli pryč i s dienstführendrem, poněvadž museli bejt v kantýně, když se jede na front, a poněvadž žádnej neví, jestli bude ještě někdy sedět v kantýně. Voni tedy tam byli, pane obrlajtnant, byli a pili, nikde po telefonu ani ode všech druhejch marškumpaček nemohli nikoho sehnat, ale poněvadž vy jste mně přikázal, abych zatím byl jako ordonanc u telefonu, než k nám přidělí telefonistu Chodounského, tak jsem seděl, čekal, až došla taky na mě řada. Z regimentskanclaje nadávali, že se nikde nemohou dozvonit, že je telefonogram, aby si maršbatalionskanclaj vyzdvihla v regimentskanclaj nějaký knížky pro pány oficíry od celého maršbaťáku. Poněvadž vím, pane obrlajtnant, že se na vojně musí jednat rychle, tak jsem telefonoval na regimentskanclaj, že sám ty knížky vyzvednu a že je odnesu do batalionskanclaje. Tam jsem dostal takový ranec, že jsem to stíží vodtáh k nám do kumpaniekanclaje, a prohlídl jsem si ty knížky. Ale to jsem si pomyslil svoje. Regimentsrechnungsfeldvébl v regimentskanclaj mně totiž povídal, že podle telefonogramu na regiment už vědí u bataliónu, co si mají z těch knížek vybrat, kerej díl. Voni totiž ty knížky byly vo dvou dílech. První díl zvlášť, druhej díl zvlášť. Nikdy v životě jsem se tak tomu nezasmál, poněvadž jsem už v životě přečet mnoho knih, ale nikdy jsem nezačal číst něco vod druhýho dílu. A von mně tam ještě jednou říká: ‚Tady máte první díly a tady máte druhý díly. Kerej díl si mají číst páni oficíři, to už vědí.‘ Tak jsem si pomyslil, že jsou všichni vožralí, poněvadž když se má kniha číst vod začátku, takovej román, jakej jsem přines, vo těch Sünden der Väter, poněvadž znám taky německy, že se musí začít s prvním dílem, poněvadž nejsme židi a nečtem to pozpátku. Proto jsem se taky vás ptal, pane obrlajtnant, po telefonu, když jste se vrátil z kasina, a hlásil jsem vám to o těch knížkách, jestli snad teď na vojně je to převrácený a jestli se nečtou knihy v obráceným pořádku, napřed druhý a potom teprve první díl A vy jste mně řek, že jsem vožralý hovado, když ani nevím, že v otčenáši je napřed ‚Otče náš‘ a potom teprve ‚amen‘. – Je vám špatně, pane obrlajtnant?“ otázal se se zájmem Švejk, když bledý nadporučík Lukáš zachytil se stupátka k vodojemu vyhaslé lokomotivy.","""With the ones I took from the regiment chancellery to the battalion?"" Schweik asked. ""You were indeed the water in which you asked me if I knew him, Lieutenant. I got a phone call directly from the regiment's office. They wanted to send the books to the battalion chancellery, but they were all gone with the dienstführendr, because they had to be in the canteen when going to the front, and since no one knew if he would ever sit in the canteen again. So they were there, Mr. Lieutenant, they were and they drank, they couldn't get anyone anywhere on the phone or from all the other marshmallowers, but since you ordered me to be on the phone as an ordinance before I was assigned a Chodounsky telephone operator, I sat down, he waited until it was my turn too. They cursed from the regiment chancellery that they could not find out anywhere that there was a telephone schedule for the marshbatalion chancellery to pick up some books for the officers from the entire marshalist in the regiment chancellery. Since I know, Lieutenant, that the war must be acted upon quickly, so I called the regiment chancellery to pick up the books myself and take them to the battalion chancellery. There I got such a bag that I could barely pull us into the company office, and I looked at the books. But that's what I thought. The Regimentsrechnungsfeldvébl in the regimentskanclaj told me that, according to the telephone schedule for the regiment, they already knew at the battalion what part to choose from which books. The books were in two parts. The first part separately, the second part separately. I've never laughed like that in my life, because I've read a lot of books in my life, but I've never started reading anything in the second part. And out there he says to me again: 'Here you have the first parts and here you have the second parts. That's how they thought they were all drunk, because when a book is to be read from the beginning, a novel like the one I brought in Sünden der Väter, because I also know German, that it must begin with the first part, because we are not Jews and do not read it backwards. That's why I also asked you, Lieutenant, on the phone when you returned from the casino, and I told you about the books, if it was upside down in the war now and if the books were not read in reverse order, first the second and then only the first part And you told me that I was a devoured beast when I didn't even know that there was 'Our Father' in the fatherland first and then 'Amen'. ""Are you sick, Lieutenant?"" Švejk asked with interest as pale Lieutenant Lukáš caught on the steps to the reservoir of the extinct locomotive.","""Those books I took from the regimental office to battalion headquarters?"" asked Schweik. "" Oh, yes, they were written by the fellow that you wanted to know whether I knew or not. I got a message by telephone direct from the regimental office. You see, sir, it was like this : They wanted to send these here books to the battalion office, but everyone there was away, orderly officers and all, because they had to be in the canteen when they're off to the front and nobody knows whether they'll ever get another chance of going to the canteen. Well, sir, there they all were, drinking for all they was worth, and I couldn't get hold of any of them by telephone, and as you told me to stay at the telephone until Chodounsky was sent to relieve me, I stuck to my post and waited till it was my turn. The regimental office kept kicking up a row because they couldn't get any answer and so they couldn't pass on the message that the draft office was to fetch some books for the officers of the whole company. Well, sir, you told me that things have got to be done promptly in wartime, so I telephoned to the regimental office and said I'd fetch those books myself and take them to the battalion office. There was a regular sackful of 'em and I had quite a job to get them into the company office. Then I had a look at those books, and that gave me an idea. You see, the quartermaster-sergeant in the regimental office told me that according to what the message said, the battalion office knew which volume of these books was wanted, Because, you see, sir, this book was in two volumes. One volume separate and another volume separate. Well, sir, talk about laugh ! I never laughed so much in all my life. Reading ain't exactly in my line, as you might say, but I never heard of anyone starting to read the second volume of a book before the first. Anyway, the quartermaster-sergeant says to me : 'There's the first volume and there's the second. The officers know which volume they've got to read.' So I thinks to myself, why, they must be all dotty, because if anyone's going to read a book like this Sins of the Fathers, or whatever it is, from the beginning, they got to start with the first volume, because we don't read books backward like what the Jews do. So then I telephoned to you, sir, when you got back from the club, and I reported about those books and asked you whether, being wartime, things was all topsy-turvey like, and books had got to be read backward, the second volume first and the first volume afterward. And you told me I was a silly chump, if I didn't even know that the Lord's Prayer began with 'Our Father' and wound up with 'Amen.' ""Are you feeling queer, sir?"" asked Schweik with concern, when Lieutenant Lukash turned pale and clutched at the step of a locomotive tender.","“The ones I had carried away from the Regimental Office to the Battalion?”, asked Švejk. “Those indeed were written by the one about whom you were asking me whether I didn’t know him, Senior Lieutenant, Sir. I had received a telephonegramm directly from the Regimental Office. That is to say they wanted to send those books to the Battalion Office, but all of them there were away, including the Watch Commander because they had to be at the mess, since we were hauling to the front, and because nobody knew whether he’d ever be sitting in the mess again. They were there then, Senior Lieutenant, Sir, they were and drinking, nowhere could anybody find any of them over the telephone, nor anybody from the other march-gangs, but because you had ordered me to be by the telephone as the messenger for the time being until they transfer telephone operator Chodounský to us, I was sitting there then, waiting, until my turn came up too. Calling from the Regimental Office they were bitterly complaining that no matter whose phone they rang nobody answered, that there was a telephonegramm to have the March Battalion Office pick up some books for the officer lords of the whole marchbatty in the Regimental Office. Because I know, Senior Lieutenant, Sir, that in the military one must act quickly, I telephoned the Regimental Office that I myself would pick up those books and that I would carry them over to the Battalion Office. There I got such a sack that I barely dragged it over to us at the Company Office and I examined the books. But I had my own thoughts. You know, the Regimental Accountant Master Sergeant at the Regimental Office was telling me that according to the telephonegramm to the regiment they already knew at the Battalion what they were to pick from among the books, which volume. Those books, that is to say, had two volumes. The first volume separate, the second volume separate. Never in my life have I laughed so hard at something because I have, in my life, read already many books, but never have I started reading something beginning with the second volume. And he’s telling me there one more time: ‘Here you have the first volumes and here you have the second volumes. The officer lords know already which volume they are to read.’ So I thought to myself that they all were drunk because when a book is to be read from the beginning, a novel such as the one about those Sins of the Fathers which I brought, because I know German too, I thought that one had to start with the first volume because we’re not Jews and won’t read it backwards. That is also why I was asking you, Senior Lieutenant, Sir, on the telephone, when you returned from the officers' club, and was reporting to you about those books, whether nowadays things were perhaps turned upside down in the military and whether the books weren’t read in the reversed order, first the second and only then the first volume. And you told me that I was a drunk dumb beast, since I didn’t even know that in the ourfather there was first the ‘Our Father’ and only then the ‘amen’. — Are you feeling sick, Senior Lieutenant, Sir?” Švejk asked with interest when the pale Senior Lieutenant Lukáš grabbed the step-up rung on the water tank of the extinguished locomotive."

"Baloun se zastavil, zamlaskal, přejel jazykem po patře a řekl smutně a měkce: „Víš, kamaráde, že teď, když to nemám, tak mně připadá, že měla žena přece jen pravdu, že jsou s tím jejím mákem lepší. Tenkrát se mně pořád zdálo, že mně ten mák leze do zubů, a teď si myslím, jen kdyby lez… Zkusila moje žena se mnou častý a velký protivenství.

How many times had she cried when I wanted her to put more marjoram in the morning, and I always stabbed her. Once I slapped her poor so that she lay for two days because she didn't want to cut me a turkey for dinner, that I just needed a tap. ""Ba, my friend,"" cried Baloun, ""if now there was a morning without marjoram and roosters."" Do you like dill? You see, it used to be a riot, and I'd drink it like coffee today. ""","Below, in the village where they were to find quarters for the company, it was pitch-dark, and all the dogs began to yelp, the result being that the expedition was brought to a standstill to discuss how these brutes could be dealt with.","Baloun stopped, smacked his lips, swept his tongue over his palate and said sadly and gently: “You know pal, now, when I don’t have it, it seems to me that my wife was right after all, that they are better with poppy seeds. Back then it constantly seemed to me that poppy seeds tended to get stuck between my teeth, and now I think if only it were so . . . My wife had often suffered from me a repeated and great adversity. She would weep quite many times when I wanted for her to put more marjoram into the jitrnice, and while she was at it I’d always smack her one or two. Once I banged her up silly so that she was lying in bed for two days, because she did not want to cut down a turkey for my supper, saying that supposedly a cockerel was enough for me. — Oh no, pal,” Baloun started weeping, “if only there were now a jitrnice without marjoram, and cockerels . . .

První s nasazením života zachraňuje telefonní drát ve své blindáži, nejsa již po tři dny u telefonu vystřídán. – Druhý, vida hrozící nebezpečí od nepřítele obejitím z flanky, s kotlem vařící polévky vrhá se na nepřítele, rozsévaje hrůzu a opařeniny u nepřítele. – Krásná smrt obou. První roztrhán minou, druhý udušen jedovatými plyny, které mu strčili pod nos, když již neměl se čím bránit. – Oba hynou s výkřikem: Es lebe unser Batalionskommandant!‘ Vrchní velitelství nemůže nežli denně přinášet nám díkůvzdání ve způsobě rozkazu, aby i jiné části naší armády znaly udatnost našeho bataliónu a vzaly si z nás příklad. Mohu vám přečíst výňatek z armádního rozkazu, který bude čten po všech oddílech armády, který se velice podobá onomu rozkazu arcivévody Karla, když stál se svým vojskem roku 1805 před Paduou a den po rozkazu dostal slušný nátěr. Poslyšte tedy, co se bude číst o našem bataliónu jako o příkladném hrdinném tělese pro všechna vojska: ‚Doufám, že celá armáda vezme si příklad z výše uvedeného bataliónu, zejména že osvojí si onoho ducha sebedůvěry a sebestatečnosti, pevné nezdolnosti v nebezpečí, oné příkladné hrdinnosti, lásky a důvěry ku svým představeným, kteréžto ctnosti, jimiž batalión vyniká, vedou ho k obdivuhodným činům, ku blahu a vítězství naší říše.

The first was torn by a mine, the second suffocated by poisonous gases that stuck under his nose when he had nothing to defend himself. ""They both die with shouts: Es lebe unser Batalionskommandant!"" I can read you an excerpt from an army order that will be read in all sections of the army, which is very similar to that of Archduke Charles when he stood with his army in 1805 in front of Padua and received a decent paint the day after the order. So listen to what will be read about our battalion as an exemplary heroic body for all armies: 'I hope that the whole army will follow the example of the above battalion, especially that it will adopt that spirit of self-confidence and self-sufficiency heroism, love and trust in his superiors, which virtues, with which the battalion excels, lead him to admirable deeds, to the well-being and victory of our empire.

The former blown to pieces by a mine, the latter suffocated by poison gas. Both perished with the cry (in German) : ""Long live our battalion commander!"" ' The supreme command can only show its gratitude by issuing orders acquainting the rest of the army with the gallantry of our battalion and urging them to take an example from us. Here's an extract from an army order which will be read to all detachments. I may say that it's very much like the order issued by Archduke Karl in 1805, on the day before he and his army got a devil of a walloping at Padua : ' I hope that the whole army will take the above-mentioned battalion as an example and in particular will gird itself with that spirit of self-reliance, self-confidence and unwavering dauntlessness in the face of danger, that unexampled heroism, that attachment to and confidence in their superior officers, in short, with all those virtues by which this battalion distinguished itself and led it on to memorable exploits, to the welfare and victory of our Emperor.'

The first torn apart by a mine, the other asphyxiated by toxic gases which they stuck under his nose when he had nothing with which to defend himself anymore. — Both are perishing with the cry: Long live our Battalion Commander!” The High Command cannot but be bringing us daily thanksgivings in the manner of an order so that other components of our army may also know the bravery of our Battalion and have us for an example. I can read an excerpt from an army order for you, which will be read to all the army units and which is very akin to that order which Archduke Karel gave when he was standing before Padua with his army in the year 1805, and the day after the order he had a pretty good paint-over job done on him. Listen up then to what will be read about our Battalion as an exemplary heroic body for all the troops: ‘ I hope that the whole army takes the above-mentioned battalion as an example, especially that it will make its own the spirit of self-assurance and self-courage, firm indomitability in danger, that exemplary valiance, love and trust in one’s superiors, these virtues, which the Battalion excels in, lead it to admirable acts, to well-being and victory of our Empire.

"Baloun vykládal právě o tom, že u nich ve mlýně měl vždy v studni láhev piva. Pivo že bylo tak studené, až zuby trnuly. Jinde ve mlýnech že večer se takovým pivem zapíjela rozhuda, ale on že ve své žravosti, za kterou ho teď pánbu potrestal, po rozhudě ještě vždycky spolkl pořádný kus masa. Teď že boží spravedlnost potrestala ho teplou smradlavou vodou ze studní v Turowé-Wolské, do které musí všichni sypat kvůli choleře kyselinu citrónovou, kterou právě před chvilkou rozdávali, když se po švarmech fasovala voda ze studní. Baloun projevil názor, že tahle kyselina citrónová je asi patrně kvůli vyhladovění lidí. Je sice pravda, že se v Sanoku trochu najedl, že dokonce obrlajtnant Lukáš mu opět přepustil půl celé porce telecího, které mu přinesl od brigády, ale že je to hrozné, že myslel přece jen, když přijdou sem a bude rast s noclehem, že se zas bude něco vařit. Už byl o tom také přesvědčen, když nabírali feldküchři vodu do kotlů. Šel se hned otázat ke kuchyním co a jak, a oni mu odpověděli, že je jenom rozkaz nabrat zatím vodu, a za chvíli že může přijít rozkaz opět tu vodu vylít.","Baloun explained that he always had a bottle of beer in the well at their mill. The beer was so cold it was clenched. Elsewhere in the mills, in the evening, such beer was drunk with judgment, but in his greed, for which he now punished him, he always swallowed a good chunk of meat after the judgment. Now that God's justice had punished him with the warm stinking water of the wells in Turowa-Wolska, into which everyone had to pour citric acid for the cholera, which they had just handed out when the water from the wells was being confronted. Baloun expressed the opinion that this citric acid is probably due to starvation. It is true that he ate a little in Sanok, that even Lieutenant Luke again gave him half the whole portion of veal he had brought him from the brigade, but that it was terrible that he thought when they came here and grew overnight, that something will be cooked again. He was already convinced of this when the feldküchers took water into the boilers. He immediately went to ask the kitchens what and how, and they told him that it was only an order to get water in the meantime, and after a while that an order could come to pour out the water again.","So before rejoining his squad, Lieutenant Dub went to look for Schweik, whom he found in the company of Baloun and Quartermaster-sergeant Vanek.","Baloun was just telling how by them at the mill he had always had a bottle of beer in the well. That the beer was so cold your teeth were getting numb being set on edge. Elsewhere in the mills, he said, in the evenings they would wash down rozhuda, farmers cheese mixed with cream, butter and chives with such beer, but that he, in his gluttony for which the Lord God has now punished him, still always swallowed a proper chunk of meat after the rozhuda. That now divine justice punished him with warm, stinking water from the wells in Turowa-Wolska, into which, on account of cholera, they all had to pour citric acid which was being distributed just a while ago as the well water was being issued by platoons. Baloun expressed the opinion that this citric acid was being issued apparently on account of starving the people out. It is true enough that in Sanok he ate a bit, that Senior Lieutenant Lukáš had even let him have again half of his portion of veal which he had brought him from the brigade, but that it was horrible because he thought after all that when they came here and there was a rest break with a night-quarters lie-down rest, something would be cooked again. He was indeed already convinced of that when the field cooks were filling the cauldrons with water. He went right away to ask at the kitchens what was up and how everything was, and they answered him that there was only an order to gather the water for the time being and that in a while an order may come to pour the water out again."

"Když se něco fasovalo zvláštního, tak mně vždycky řek: ,Nechte si to, Švejku, ‘ nebo: A co, já o to tolik nestojím, dejte sem kousek a s ostatním si dělejte, co chcete.‘ A když jsme byli v Praze a on mne poslal někdy pro oběd do restaurace, tak aby si snad nemyslil, že mu nesu malou porci, poněvadž jsem polovičku na cestě sežral, sám jsem ze svých posledních peněz, když se mně zdála být porce malou, přikoupil ještě jednu, aby se pan obrlajtnant najed a vo mně si nic špatnýho nemyslel. Až takhle jednou na to přišel. Musel jsem mu vždycky nosit z restaurace jídelní lístek a on si vybral. Tak si vybral ten den nadívané holoubě. Já jsem si myslel, když mně dali půlku, že by si snad mohl pan obrlajtnant myslet, že jsem mu druhou půlku sežral, tak jsem ještě jednu porci koupil ze svýho a přines takovou nádhernou porci, že pan obrlajtnant Šeba, který ten den sháněl oběd a přišel právě před polednem na návštěvu k mýmu obrlajtnantovi, se taky najed. Ale když se najed, povídá: ‚Tohle mně neříkej, že je to jedna porce. Na celým světě nedostaneš na menu celý nadívaný holoubě. Když seženu dneska peníze, tak si pošlu do tý tvý restaurace pro oběd. Řekni to upřímně, že je to dvojnásobná porce.‘ Pan obrlajtnant se mě zeptal před ním, abych dosvědčil, že dal mně peníze jen na jednoduchou porci, poněvadž nevěděl, že přijde. Odpověděl jsem, že mně dal peníze na vobyčejný oběd. ‚Tak vidíš,‘ řekl můj obrlajtnant, ‚tohle ještě nic není. Předešle mně přines Švejk dvě husí stehna k obědu. Tedy si představ: polívka s nudlema, hovězí maso se sardelovou omáčkou, dvě husí stehna, knedlíků a zelí do stropu a palačinky!‘ “","When something strange was happening, he always said to me, 'Keep it, Schweik,' or: And what, I don't care so much, put a little here and do what you want with the others. 'And when we were in Prague and he he sent me to a restaurant for lunch, so that he wouldn't think I was carrying a small portion of him, because I ate half of the way, I bought another one of my last money when it seemed to me a small portion, so that the lieutenant he drove and he didn't think anything wrong with me. He figured it out once. I always had to bring him a menu from the restaurant and he chose. So he chose a stuffed pigeon that day. I thought, when they gave me half, that maybe the lieutenant might think I ate the other half, so I bought another portion of my own and brought such a wonderful portion that the lieutenant Sheba, who was looking for lunch that day, and he came to visit my lieutenant just before noon, he also ate. But when he eats up, he says, 'Don't tell me this is one serving. You won't get a stuffed pigeon on the menu all over the world. If I get the money today, I'll send it to your restaurant for lunch. Say it honestly, it's a double portion. 'The Lieutenant asked me in front of him to testify that he had given me money for a single portion, because he did not know it was coming. I replied that he had given me money for an ordinary lunch. 'So you see,' said my lieutenant, 'this is nothing yet. Before me, Schweik brought me two goose thighs for lunch. So imagine: noodle soup, beef with anchovy sauce, two goose legs, dumplings and cabbage on the ceiling and pancakes! '","When something special was served out, he'd always say to me: 'Schweik,' he said, 'keep it for yourself,' or: 'Oh, I don't fancy that particularly ; let me have just a scrap of it and do what you like with the rest.' And when we was in Prague and he used to send me sometimes to fetch his lunch from a restaurant, so as he shouldn't think he'd got a small helping because I'd eaten half of it on the way, when I thought the helping was too small, I bought an extra helping with my own money, so as he could have a proper feed and not think any harm of me. Till one day, he spotted what I'd been up to. It was like this : I always had to bring him the bill of fare from the restaurant and then he chose what he wanted. Well, that particular day he chose some stuffed pigeon. Now when I saw they gave me only half a bird, I thought he might think I'd eaten the other half on the way, so I bought an extra portion with my own money and brought him such a grand helping that Lieutenant Seba, who'd been nosing round after some lunch that day, and had just come to pay my lieutenant a call, was able to have a feed of it as well. But when he'd finished, he says: 'Don't tell me that's a single portion. Why, there isn't a restaurant on earth where you can get a whole stuffed pigeon on the bill of fare. If I can scrape together some money to-day, I'm going to send out to that restaurant of yours for some lunch. Now own up ; that's a double portion, isn't it?' Well, the lieutenant asked me to bear him out that he'd only given me enough money for a single portion, because he didn't know that Lieutenant Seba was coming. So I said he'd only given me enough money for a single lunch. ' There you are,' says my lieutenant. ' And this ain't nothing,' he says. ' Why, the other day Schweik brought me two legs of goose for lunch. Just imagine Vermicelli soup, beef with horse-radish sauce, two legs of goose, dumplings and piles of cabbage and pancakes.' ""","When something special was being issued he would always tell me: ‘Keep it, Švejk,’ or: ‘Oh well, I’m never that interested in it, pass a bit over here and do what you want with the rest.’ And when we were in Prague and he would sometimes send me to a restaurant for a lunch, then in order that he would not think I was bringing him a small portion because I gobbled up half of it on the way perhaps, I myself would buy an additional one with my last money, when the portion seemed to me too small, so that Mister Senior Lieutenant would eat his fill and think nothing bad of me. Until, this one time, he found out about it. I always had to bring him the menu from the restaurant and he would choose. So he chose a stuffed young pigeon that day. I thought, when they gave me a half, that perhaps Mister Senior Lieutenant could think that I gobbled up the other one of his, so I bought another portion with my own money and brought him such a beautiful portion that Mister Senior Lieutenant Šeba, who was chasing down a lunch that day and came just before noon for a visit at my Senior Lieutenant’s, ate his fill too. But when he finished eating, he said: ‘Don’t be telling me that this is one portion. Nowhere in the whole world will you get the whole stuffed young pigeon on the menu. If I chase down some money today I’ll send to that restaurant of yours for a lunch. Admit it sincerely, it is a double portion.’ Mister Senior Lieutenant asked me in front of him for me to testify that he gave me money only for one single portion, because he didn’t know that he would come. I answered that he had given me money for an ordinary lunch. ‘So you see,’ said my Senior Lieutenant, ‘this is still nothing. The last time Švejk brought me two goose thighs for lunch. Imagine then: soup with noodles, beef with anchovy sauce, two goose thighs, dumplings and sauerkraut up to the ceiling, and crepes!”"

"Tohle byla tedy jakási průprava, ne tak do důsledků tragická, ale přece jen poučná. Když totiž se měl již guláš rozdávat, přišel rozkaz „Do vagónů!“ a už se jelo na Miškovec. Ani tam se nerozdal guláš, poněvadž na trati stál vlak s ruskými vagóny, proto se mužstvo nepustilo ven z vagónů a ponechalo se mužstvu volné pole k fantazii, že se bude guláš rozdávat, až se vyleze už v Haliči z vlaku, kde bude uznán guláš zkysaným, k požívání neschopným, a pak že se vyleje.","So this was a kind of preparation, not so tragic in the consequences, but still instructive. When the goulash was to be distributed, the order ""Into the wagons!"" Came and they went to Miškovec. The goulash was not delivered there either, because there was a train with Russian wagons on the track, so the team did not leave the wagons and the team was left free to imagine that the goulash would be distributed when the goulash was accepted in Galicia. sour, incapable of consumption, and then it spills.","So when the stew was about to be served out, the order came for the troops to return to their trucks, and off they went to Miskolcz. No stew was served out there, because a train with Russian trucks was standing in the station and the men were therefore not allowed out. Fantastic rumours now began to spread among the troops that the stew would not be served out until they left the train in Galicia once and for all, when it would be decided that the stew was rancid and unfit for consumption, whereupon it would be thrown away.","This was then some sort of training, not so tragic in its consequences, but a lesson nevertheless. That is to say, when the goulash was to be distributed at last, the order came “Into the cars!” and we were already hauling off to Miškovec. Not even there was the goulash distributed because on the track there stood a train with Russian railroad cars , therefore the rank-and-file was not let out of the cars and an open field was left to the rank-and-file for their imagination to fantasize that the goulash would be distributed when they crawled off the train once in Galicia, where the goulash would be deemed spoiled sour, unsuitable for ingestion, and that then it would be poured out."
"„To byla docela taková krajina, jako je tady, jenomže my jsme nešli tak feldmésik, poněvadž tenkrát ještě jsme ani nevěděli, co jsou to rezervní konzervy, když jsme nějakou konzervu fasovali, tak jsme ji u našeho cuku hned při nejbližším noclehu sežrali a místo toho dávali jsme si do baťochu cihlu. V jedný vesnici přišla inspekce, vyházeli nám všechny cihly z baťochu a bylo jich tolik, že si tam z nich jeden člověk vystavěl potom rodinnej domek.“","""It was quite a landscape like here, but we didn't go to feldmésik, because at that time we didn't even know what reserve cans were, when we packed some cans, so we ate it at our stud next night and instead We put a brick in our backpack. An inspection came in one village, they threw all our bricks out of our backpacks, and there were so many of them that one of them built a family house there. ”","Schweik toddled along right at the back with the ambulance section, while Lieutenant Lukash rode up and down the column, frequently inspecting the ambulance section at the rear, in order to ascertain whether there was any improvement in the condition of Lieutenant Dub, who was being conveyed in a small cart, covered with tarpaulin, to fresh exploits in an unknown future. Lieutenant Lukash also relieved the monotony of the march every now and then by exchanging a few words with Schweik, who, stolidly shouldering his haversack and rifle, was telling Quartermaster-sergeant Vanek about how many years before he had been on a fine route march during the manœuvres at Velké Mezirici.","“The landscape there was altogether like it is here, except we weren’t going with truly full battle gear because back then we hadn’t even known yet what reserve food cans were, and when we got any can issued then as for our platoon we gobbled it up during the nearest night quarters where we’d lie down to rest and we would put a brick in its place in the back-pack. In one village an inspection came, they threw all our bricks out of the back-packs and there were so many that afterward one man there built a family home out of them for himself.”"

"„Jen když dovedete, Švejku, všechno správně vysvětlit,“ řekl nadporučík Lukáš a rozjel se kupředu. Tam se již kolona trhala, nezvyklý pochod po odpočinku ve vlaku, v plné, dokonalé výzbroji, působil, že všem počala bolet ramena a každý si pohovoval, jak mohl. Přendavali ručnice z jedné strany na druhou, většina už je nenesla na řemeni, ale přehozené jako hrábě nebo vidle. Někteří mysleli, že si lépe vyhoví, když půjdou příkopem nebo po mezi, kde se jim zdála půda pod nohama přece jen měkčí než na zaprášené silnici.","""Only if you can explain everything correctly, Švejk,"" said Lieutenant Lukáš and drove forward. The convoy was already tearing there, an unusual march after resting on the train, in full, perfect armament, caused everyone's shoulders to ache, and everyone relaxed as best they could.

Some thought they would be better off walking through a ditch or between, where the ground beneath their feet seemed softer than on a dusty road.","""Well, Schweik, there's no getting away from it, you always manage to hit the nail on the head,"" said Lieutenant Lukash, and rode forward to the other end of the column. The men were now beginning to straggle, because after their long rest in the train the march in full equipment was making their limbs ache, and they eased themselves as best they could. They kept shifting their rifles from one side to the other and most of them went plodding along with bowed heads. They were all suffering from great thirst because, although the sun had already gone down, it was as sultry as in the middle of the day, and by now their water bottles were all quite empty.","“Nothing matters, Švejk, as long as you are able to explain everything properly,” Senior Lieutenant Lukáš said and started riding to the front. There the convoy was already breaking up, since after the rest on the train the unusual march, with full, perfect battle gear was giving rise to the fact that everybody’s shoulders started to ache and everybody was easing up any way he could help it. They were switching the rifle from one side to the other, most were not carrying it by the leather strap, but thrown down across the shoulder like a rake or a pitchfork. Some thought that they would do better for themselves if they walked in the ditch or down the balk where the soil under their feet seemed softer after all than on the dusty road."

"Poručík Dub zadíval se na tento předmět, ale nemohl nežli prostě zjistit, že je to opravdu jeden z těch invalidů, kteří své svěží mládí trávili pod postelí.","Lieutenant Dub looked at the subject, but he couldn't help but realize that it was indeed one of those invalids who had spent their fresh youth under the bed.","And, right enough, at the bottom of the cutting lay defiantly a chamber pot with the enamel all chipped, eaten away with rust, among shards and other objects which, being no longer fit for domestic purposes, had been discarded by the station master, as material for arguments in future centuries by archaeologists who, having unearthed this settlement, would go quite crazy about it, and school children would be taught about the age of enamelled chamber pots.","Lieutenant Dub began peering at this object, yet couldn’t but simply realize that it was indeed one of those invalids who spent their fresh youth under a bed."
Poručík Dub vytáhl revolver a otázal se: „Znáš to?“,"Lieutenant Dub drew his revolver and asked, ""Do you know that?""","Lieutenant Dub took out his revolver and asked : ""Do you know what that is?""",Lieutenant Dub pulled out the revolver and asked: “Do you know this?”
"Poručík Dub ovšem vojákům, kteří se kolem rozbitých děl a aeroplánů shromáždili, vykládal, že je to válečná kořist, a také zpozoroval, že kousek dál stojí opět ve skupině Švejk a něco vykládá. Přiblížil se tedy k tomu místu a slyšel rozšafný hlas Švejkův: „Aťsi se to vezme jak chce, je to přece jen válečná kořist. Vono je to sice na první pohled vošemetný, když tady někdo čte na lafetě K. u k. Artilleriedivision. Ale vono to bude asi tak, že to dělo padlo do rukou Rusů a my jsme si ho museli zas nazpět vydobýt, a taková kořist je mnohem cennější, poněvadž… – Poněvadž,“ řekl slavnostně, když zpozoroval poručíka Duba, „nepříteli se nesmí nechat nic v rukou. To máte jako s Přemyšlem, nebo s tím vojákem, kerýmu při gefechtu vytrh nepřítel feldflašku. To bylo ještě za napoleonských válek, a ten voják v noci odebral se do nepřátelskýho ležení a přines si zas feldflašku nazpátek a vydělal ještě přitom, poněvadž nepřítel na noc fasoval kořalku.“","However, Lieutenant Dub explained to the soldiers who had gathered around the broken cannons and airplanes that it was spoils of war, and he also noticed that he was standing a short distance away again in the Švejk group, explaining something. So he approached the place and heard Švejk's vicious voice: ""No matter how you take it, it's just spoils of war. Vono is, at first glance, omnipotent when someone reads here on the mount K. u k. Artilleriedivision. But it will probably be the case that the cannon fell into the hands of the Russians and we had to reclaim it, and such loot is much more valuable, because… - Because, ""he said solemnly, when he noticed Lieutenant Dub,"" the enemy must not be allowed to nothing in your hands. You have it like with Přemyšl, or with the soldier who, at the time of the confession, snatches the enemy of the field bottle. That was during the Napoleonic Wars, and the soldier went to the enemy's camp at night and brought the feldflach back, earning even more, because the enemy was confiscating the brandy for the night. ""","Lieutenant Dub, however, was explaining to the troops who had assembled round the damaged guns and aeroplanes that this was war booty. He noticed, too, that a little further on Schweik was standing in another group and holding forth about something. He drew near and heard Schweik's hearty voice : ""You can take it how you like, it can't be anything but war booty. It may look a bit rum at first, when you read 'Imperial Royal Artillery Division' on a gun carriage. But I expect that the Russians collared that gun and we had to get hold of it again. Booty like that is a lot more valuable, because - ""Because,"" he solemnly continued, when he caught sight of Lieutenant Dub, ""you must never leave anything in the enemy's hands. That's like the soldier who had his field bottle snatched away from him by the enemy while they were having a dust-up. That was during the wars with Napoleon, and in the night this soldier went off into the enemy's camp and brought his field bottle back, and he had the best of the bargain, because the enemy had drawn his brandy rations for the night. ""","Lieutenant Dub, however, was telling the soldiers who had gathered around the broken cannons and airplanes that it was war booty, and he also noticed that standing in a group a bit farther was again Švejk who was telling about something. Therefore he went nearer to that spot and heard the judicious voice of Švejk: “Any way you take it, it is, after all, war booty. It is, true enough, precarious at first sight when somebody reads here on the gun-carriage I&R Artillery Division. But what it perhaps will turn out to be is that the gun had fallen into the hands of the Russians and we had to capture it back again, fighting, and such booty is more valuable because . . . — Because,” he said festively when he caught the sight of Lieutenant Dub, “nothing must be left in the enemy’s hands. It is like with the case of Premyšl, or with the soldier who had his field flask torn away from him in combat by the enemy. That was back during the Napoleonic wars, and the soldier set out for the enemy encampment at night and brought the field flask back again for himself and he made out after all because the enemy had gotten gin issued for the night.”"
"„Kdyby vás tak slyšel Švejk,“ poznamenal účetní šikovatel Vaněk, „ten by nám uvedl aspoň nějaký příklad.“","""If Švejk heard you like that,"" Vaník, an accountant, he would at least give us an example. ""","At this point Schweik rolled over on to the other side and went on snoring, while Jurajda and the volunteer officer started an argument on the future life.","“If only Švejk heard you,” remarked Accountant Master Sergeant Vanek, “he would at least present some example for us.”"

"„Já rychle trávím,“ řekl Baloun, „u mě toho v žaloudku nikdy mnoho nezůstane. Já ti třebas, kamaráde, sežeru celou mísu knedlíků s vepřovou a se zelím, a za půl hodiny víc ti ze všeho toho nevyseru jak tak na tři polívkový lžíce, vostatní se ti ve mně ztratí. Někdo kupříkladu říká, že když sní lišky, že z něho vyjdou tak, jak byly, jen je vyprat a dělat je zas znova nakyselo, a u mě navopak. Nažeru se ti lišek, že by jinej prasknul, a když potom jdu na záchod, tak ti vyprdnu jen trochu žlutý kaše, jako vod dítěte, vostatní se taky ve mně ztratí. – Ve mně se ti, kamaráde,“ důvěrně sděloval Baloun Švejkovi, „rozpouštějí kosti vod ryb a pecky ze švestek. Jednou jsem to schválně počítal. Sněd jsem sedumdesát švestkovejch knedlíků s peckama, a když přišla moje chvíle, šel jsem za humna, šťoural jsem se v tom dřevíčkem, dával pecky stranou a počítal. Ze sedumdesáti pecek rozpustilo se ve mně přes polovičku.“","""I spend fast,"" said Baloun, ""there will never be much left in my stomach. For example, my friend, I will eat you a whole bowl of dumplings with pork and cabbage, and in half an hour more of it I won't fuck you with three tablespoons, the others will get lost in me. For example, someone says that when they eat foxes that they come out of it the way they were, they just wash them and make them sour again, and vice versa. I don't eat foxes that someone else will burst, and then when I go to the toilet, I just give you a little yellow porridge, like a child's water, the others also get lost in me.

I ate seventy plum dumplings with seeds, and when my time came, I went to the threshing floor, poked around in the wood, set the seeds aside, and counted. More than half of the seventy seeds have dissolved in me. ""","But if his stomach's empty, a wound like that is nothing at all, just a mere fleabite, only nicer."" Below, in the village where they were to find quarters for the company, it was pitch-dark, and all the dogs began to yelp, the result being that the expedition was brought to a standstill to discuss how these brutes could be dealt with.","“I digest quickly,” said Baloun, “with me there’s never much left in the stomach. Pal, I will gobble up, for example, a whole bowl of dumplings with pork and sauerkraut, and half an hour later I won’t shit more than about three tablespoons out of it, the rest disappears in me. Someone says for example, that when he eats the fox mushrooms16 they will come out of him as they were, one would have to only launder them and make them sour style again, and with me it’s the other way around. I will gorge myself full of foxes, enough to make someone else burst, and then when I go to the rest room, let me tell you, I’ll fart out only a bit of yellow puree then, like from a baby, the rest also disappears in me. — Inside me, pal,” Baloun was confidentially relaying to Švejk, “dissolve bones of fish and stones from prunes. Once, just for the heck of it, I counted them. I ate seventy prune filled fruit dumplings, including the stones, and when my moment had come I went beyond the village meadows and was poking in it with a stick, putting stones aside and counting. Out of seventy stones more than a half dissolved in me.”"

Besides that from the whole look of the Schweik in question, it can be seen that he is of faint reason.","Captain Sagner, who, as a regular officer, loathed all reserve officers, reminded Lieutenant Dub that proceedings of the kind which he was suggesting could be carried out only through the orderly room and not by any slapdash methods as if it were a case of haggling with a street hawker about the price of potatoes.","Lieutenant Dub wavered and said that he was requesting punishment only in the wider sense of the word and that it may be that the said Švejk wasn’t able to express himself, and so his answers effect the impression of cheekiness, insolence and lack of respect toward superiors.

"Když poručík Dub odcházel od Švejka, pomyslil si v své kocovině: „Může být, že by na něho lépe účinkovalo, kdybych mu byl řekl: Já tě, chlape, už dávno znám z té špatné stránky.“","As Lieutenant Dub left Švejk, he thought in his hangover, ""It might be better for me to say, 'I know you, man, for a long time.'","And, as this seemed somehow inconclusive, he tacked on to it his ancient slogan : ""You don't know me, but I know you.""","When Lieutenant Dub was walking away from Švejk, in his hangover stupor he thought: “May be that it would be affecting him better had I told him: ‘I have, you sonofagun, long since known you from the bad side.”"

Ve společnosti byl neoblíben, poněvadž o něm bylo jisto, že je též denunciantem mezi svými kolegy. V městě, kde vyučoval, byl jedním z členů trojlístku největších pitomců a mezků, který se skládal z něho, okresního hejtmana a ředitele gymnázia. V tomto úzkém kroužku naučil se politizovat v rámcích rakousko-uherského mocnářství. Též nyní počal vykládat své rozumy hlasem a přízvukem zkostnatělého profesora:","He always made sure that all his students sang the Austrian anthem with enthusiasm on the imperial birthday and other similar imperial celebrations.

In the city where he taught, he was one of the members of the trio of the biggest idiots and mules, which consisted of him, the district governor and the director of the grammar school.

When he got the answer that there was a lieutenant there, he was even harder.","When they had installed themselves there, Captain Tayerle ordered a bottle of brandy and called for any of the girls who were disengaged to be sent in.

He wanted to know who was with Miss Ella. When he was told that it was a lieutenant, he blustered more than ever.","When all three were sitting in the coffeehouse Tayrle ordered that a bottle of rowan brandy be brought and have some misses called, who were free.

"„Já jsem byl, jak povídám,“ zněl na opuštěné koleji měkký hlas Švejkův, „taky téhož mínění. Jednou jsem koupil krvák vo Róžovi Šavaňů z Bakonskýho lesa a scházel tam první díl, tak jsem se musel dohadovat vo tom začátku, a ani v takovej raubířskej historii se neobejdete bez prvního dílu. Tak mně bylo úplně jasný, že je to vlastně zbytečný, kdyby páni oficíři začli číst napřed druhý díl a potom první, a jak by to vypadalo hloupě, kdybych u bataliónu byl vyřídil to, co říkali v regimentskanclaj, že páni oficíři už vědí, kerej díl mají číst. Vono mně to vůbec s těma knížkama, pane obrlajtnant, připadalo strašně nápadný a záhadný. Já věděl, že páni oficíři vůbec málo čtou, a když je řvava válečná…“","""I was, as I say,"" Švejk's soft voice on the deserted dormitory, ""of the same opinion. I once bought a bloodsucker in Róž Šavaň from the Bakon Forest and the first part was missing there, so I had to argue at the beginning, and even in such a history of craftsmanship you can't do without the first part. So it was very clear to me that it was actually useless if the officers started reading the second part first and then the first, and how silly it would look if I had done in the battalion what they said in the regiment chancellery that the officers already knew, kerej part they have to read. It seemed terribly conspicuous and enigmatic to me with those books, Mr. Lieutenant. I knew that the officers read little at all, and when the roar is war… ""","""Well, sir, as I was saying,"" continued Schweik in honeyed tones, ""that's what I thought, too. Once I bought one of these thrillers all about the bloodthirsty bandit of the Bakony Forest and the first part was missing, so I had to guess how it started, so you see even in a tale like that, all about a bloodthirsty bandit, you can't do without the beginning. So it didn't take me long to see that there was no need for the officers to start reading Volume I afterward. What with one thing and another, it struck me that there was something very funny about those books. I knew that officers don't do much reading, anyway, and now with the war on and all that------""","“I was, as I’ve been saying,” one could hear the sound of Švejk’s soft voice on the abandoned track, “also of the same mind. Once I bought a bloody adventure book about Róža Šavanu from the Bakony Forest and there the first volume was missing so I had to be guessing about the beginning, and even in such a rascal’s story one cannot do without the first volume. So it was totally clear to me that it would be actually pointless if the officer lords started reading the second volume first and then the first, and how dumb it would look if at the Battalion I were to pass on what they were saying at the Regimental Office that the officer lords already knew which volume they were to read. The whole thing with the books struck me, Senior Lieutenant, Sir, as altogether terribly suspicious and mysterious. I knew that the officer lords read altogether little, and when there’s the tumult of the battle . . .”"

"Všichni důstojníci se na něho dívají soustrastně, jako kdyby chtěli říct, ten pán za svou blbost nemůže. Nenalézaje odporu, poručík Dub rozežvanil se dál o nádherném dojmu, kterým na něho působí tato rozbitá krajina, svědčící o tom, jak dovede bít železná pěst našeho vojska. Opět mu nikdo neodpovídá, načež on opakuje: „Ano, zajisté, ovšem, Rusové zde ustupovali v úplné panice.“","All the officers look at him sympathetically, as if to say, the gentleman cannot be blamed for his stupidity. Finding no resistance, Lieutenant Dub continued to resent the wonderful impression this shattered landscape made of him, a testament to how he could beat the iron fist of our army. Again, no one answers him, and he repeats, ""Yes, of course, the Russians are retreating in complete panic.""","All the officers looked at him pityingly, as much as to say : ""It's not his fault that he's dotty."" Finding that his views met with no contradiction, Lieutenant Dub went on jabbering about the magnificent impression which the battered landscape made upon him, for it bore testimony, he said, to the formidable character of our army's iron grip. Again nobody contradicted him, and he added : ""Oh, yes, there can be no doubt that the Russians retreated here in a thorough panic.""","All the officers are looking at him with an expression of extending condolences, as if they wanted to say this gentleman can't help his idiocy. Having encountered no resistance, Lieutenant Dub expanded his blabbering onto the subject of the magnificent impression which this busted landscape exerted on him, giving testimony to how capable of fighting the iron fist of our military is. Again nobody answers him, to which he repeats: “Yes, indeed, of course, Russians were retreating here in absolute panic.”"
"Zatímco se všichni čtyři vypravili na cestu, objevil se u kumpanie pan místní plebán a rozdával vojákům dle jich národnosti lísteček s „Lurdskou písní“ ve všech jazycích.

"Potom následoval rozkaz ukázat pohotovost. Opět dal tedy hejtman Ságner zatroubit alarm a inspekční generál, dívaje se na seřazování bataliónu do šiku, procházel se s důstojníky a neustále k nim mluvil, jako by to byli nějací idioti a nemohli to hned pochopit, přičemž ukazoval na ručičky hodinek: „Also, sehen sie. Um halb neune scheißen und nach einer halben Stunde schlafen. Das genügt vollkommen. V této přechodné době má beztoho mužstvo řídkou stolici. Hlavně kladu důraz na spánek. To je posila k dalším pochodům. Dokud je mužstvo ve vlaku, musí si odpočinout. Jestli není dosti místa ve vagónech, mužstvo spí partienweise. Jedna třetina mužstva ve vagónu si lehne pohodlně a spí od devíti do půlnoci, a ostatní stojí a dívají se na ně. Pak první vyspalí dělají místo druhé třetině, která spí od půlnoci do třetí hodiny ranní. Třetí partie spí od tří do šesti, pak je budíček a mužstvo se myje. Při jízdě z vagónů ne-se-ska-ko-vat! Postavit před ešalon patroly, aby mužstvo při jízdě ne-se-ska-ko-va-lo! Jestli vojákovi zláme nohu nepřítel…,“ generál poklepal si přitom nohu, „jest to něco chvalitebného, ale mrzačit se zbytečným seskakováním v plné jízdě z vagónů jest trestuhodné. – To je tedy váš batalión?“ tázal se hejtmana Ságnera, pozoruje ospalé postavy mužstva, z nichž mnozí nemohli se udržet, a vyburcováni ze spánku, zívali na svěžím nočním vzduchu. „To je, pane hejtmane, zívající batalión. Mužstvo musí jít v devět hodin spat.“","This was followed by an order to show readiness. Again, Captain Ságner blew the alarm and the inspection general, looking at the battalion, he walked with the officers and kept talking to them as if they were some idiots and they couldn't immediately understand it, pointing to the hands of the watch: ""Also, see you. A few shifts and sleep after a half hour. It comes full. During this transitional period, the team has loose stools. The main emphasis is on sleep. This is a reinforcement for further marches. As long as the team is on the train, they have to rest. If there is not enough space in the wagons, the team sleeps partienweise. One third of the team in the car lies down comfortably and sleeps from nine to midnight, and the others stand and watch them. Then the first sleepers make room for the second third, which sleeps from midnight to three o'clock in the morning. The third game sleeps from three to six, then there is an alarm clock and the team washes. When driving from wagons don't-s-ska-ko-vat! Stand in front of the echalon patrol to keep the team from driving not-with-ska-ko-va-lo! If we break an enemy's leg, ""the general tapped his leg,"" it's something commendable, but it is reprehensible to cripple unnecessarily by jumping out of a car. ""Is this your battalion, then?"" Asked Captain Ságner, watching the sleepy figures of the team, many of whom could not survive, and awakened from their sleep, yawning in the fresh night air. ""That's the captain, yawning battalion. The team must go to bed at nine o'clock. ""","Captain Sagner, who, as a regular officer, loathed all reserve officers, reminded Lieutenant Dub that proceedings of the kind which he was suggesting could be carried out only through the orderly room and not by any slapdash methods as if it were a case of haggling with a street hawker about the price of potatoes.","Then there followed the order to show battle readiness. Once again then Captain Ságner had them trumpet the alarm and the inspecting General, watching the Battalion falling into formation, was strolling with the officers and was constantly talking to them as if they were some idiots and couldn’t get it right away, and while doing that he was pointing to the hands on the watch: “ So, look. At half past eight shit and half an hour later sleep. That is perfectly sufficient. During this transition time the rank-and-file has runny stool anyhow. Above all I stress sleep. That is a boost for further marches. As long as the men are on the train, they have to have a rest. If there is not enough room in the cars, the men sleep in shifts. One third of the men in the cars will lie down comfortably and sleep from nine to midnight, and the rest are standing and watching them. Then the first ones refreshed by sleep make room for the second third, which sleeps from midnight until the third hour of the morning. The third shift sleeps from three until six , then there’s reveille and the men are washing themselves. No jumping off while the train is moving! Place patrols in front of the military transport train, so that the rank-and-file is not jumping off during the ride! When the enemy breaks a soldier’s leg . . . ,” the General tapped his own leg while saying that, “it is something commendable, but to get oneself maimed by unnecessary jumping off the train at full speed is worthy of punishment. — So this is then your battalion?” he was asking of Captain Ságner while observing the sleepy figures of the men of whom many couldn't restrain themselves, and having been roused out of sleep, they were yawning in the fresh night air. “It is, Mister Captain, a yawning battalion. The men must go to sleep at nine o’clock.”"

"Jednoroční dobrovolník prohlásil, že dnes, díky vyspělé válečné technice, možno je s úspěchem nepřítele rozpůlit třebas i na tři příčné díly. Existuje zákon o obnovení těla mrskavek z rodu nálevníků; každá rozpůlená část obnovuje se, dostává nové ústrojí a roste samostatně jako mrskavka. V analogickém případě po každé bitvě by se rakouské vojsko zúčastnivší se této bitvy ztrojnásobilo, zdesateronásobilo, ke každé noze by se vyvinul nový svěží infanterista.","The one-year-old volunteer stated that today, thanks to advanced war technology, it is possible to successfully halve the enemy, even into three cross sections.

In the analogous case, after each battle, the Austrian army involved in this battle would triple, tenfold, a new fresh infantryman would develop at each leg.","At Kralup there used to be a man named Jarosh who made water pumps and he was the very image of a watchmaker at Pardubice named Lejhanzl, and he again was as like another fellow named Piskor at Jicin, and the whole lot of 'em couldn't be told apart from the corpse of a stranger who was found in a pond, all rotting away, just near the railway line at Neuhaus. "" Snores were now heard, and then : ""So they all had to pay a whopping big fine, and to-morrow, Mrs. Muller , I want you to cook me some noodles.""","The one-year volunteer declared that today, thanks to advanced military technology, it was possible to successfully cut the enemy asunder perhaps even into three crosswise pieces. There is a law of regeneration of the body among stentors of the infusorians family; each part torn asunder regenerates itself, gains new organs and grows independently as a stentor. In an analogous case, after each battle the Austrian troops having participated in this battle would increase threefold, tenfold, each leg would develop a new, fresh infantryman."
