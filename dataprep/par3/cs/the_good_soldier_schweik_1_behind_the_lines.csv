On the box was the picture of a shell bursting. Under it, a man in a cone-shaped Austrian soldier’s helmet rushed forward with a bayonet.

That's it, you scumbags, and I'm asking you to be polite at Mass so that it's not the last thing they exchange commodity bread for bread in the back and eat it while lifting it. ”","“Everyone should use this man as an example. What is he doing? Weeping. Don’t weep. I’m telling you, don’t weep. You want to change for the better? That you will not accomplish so easily, boy. Now, you’re weeping. But, when you return to your cage, you’ll be just the same kind of hoodlum as you were before. You must dwell on the ceaseless grace and mercy of God. You must take great care of your sinning soul in order to find the right path in this world, and then walk down it. “Today, we see that one man of ours has broken down into tears and wants to repent. And, what are the rest of you doing? Nothing at all. That one over there is chewing something, as if his parents were ruminants: cows, maybe. And, over there, they’re searching, in the temple of God, for lice in their shirts! Can’t you scratch yourselves at home?! Do you have to leave it to do during our very divine services? And you, Command Warden, Sir! Don’t you even notice these things? “After all, you’re all supposed to be soldiers, not some numskull civilians. You are supposed to behave as soldiers should, even if you are in a church. Get going, goddamit! Search for God and leave your search for lice at home. That’s all I have to say to you, you street punks. I’m asking you to behave properly during the mass. Not like last time, when you were trading government issue linen for bread in the back, and feeding on it during the elevation of the host.”","""Let each of you take an example from this man. What is he doing? He's crying. Don't cry, I tell you, don't cry. You want to become a better man. That's not such an easy job, my lad. You're crying now, but when you get back to your cell, you'll be just as big a blackguard as you were before. You'll have to ponder a lot more on the infinite grace and mercy of God ; you'll have to make a great effort before your sinful soul is likely to find the right path in this world upon which it should proceed. To-day with our own eyes we see a man here moved to tears in his desire for a change of heart, and what are the rest of you doing? Nothing at all. There's a man chewing something as if his parents had brought him up to chew the cud and another fellow over there is searching his shirt for fleas, and in the Temple of the Lord, too. Can't you do all your scratching at home? Must you leave it till you're at Divine Service, of all places? And you're very slack about everything, too, Staff-Warder Slavik. You're all soldiers and not a pack of damn silly civilians. So you ought to behave in a soldierly manner, even though you are in church. Damn it all, get busy seeking God, and look for fleas at home. That's all I've got to say, you loafers, and I want you to behave properly at Mass, and not like the last time when some fellows at the back were swapping government linen for grub."""

Pak jsme všichni slyšeli, že pan Bretschneider řekl, vytahuje si zápisník: ,I hleďme, zase nová pěkná velezráda!', a odešel s tím čalou­níkem z Příčné ulice, který se již nevrátil.”","""Like my husband,"" she replied in a repayment, ""he asked him if he would shoot at the Serbs. And he told him that he could not shoot, that he had once been to the shooting range and covered the crown there.

""","“Just about like my husband,” she answered, again beginning to weep. “He asked him whether he would shoot at the Serbs. The upholsterer told him that he didn’t know how to shoot. He told him he was once at a shooting gallery, and shot up a crown.4 Then, Mister Bretschneider pulled out his notebook and we all heard him say: ‘Look here! Again, we have high treason!’ Then, he left with the upholsterer from Prícná Street, who has never returned.” “There will be more of those who won’t return,” said Švejk.","""Much the same as my husband,"" she replied, weeping. "" Bretschneider asked him if he'd fire against the Serbs. And he said he didn't know how to shoot. He'd been once, he said, to a shooting gallery and had some shots for a crown.

"„Voběsil se na kšandě,” řekl Švejk, čistě si tvrdý klobouk. „A ta kšanda nebyla ani jeho. Tu si vypůjčil od profousa, že prý mu padají kalhoty. Měl čekat, až ho zastřelejí? To vědí, paní Müllerová, že v takový situaci jde každému hlava kolem. Profousa za to degradovali a dali mu šest měsíců. Ale von si je nevodseděl. Utek do Švejcar a dneska tam dělá kazatele ňáký církve. Dneska je málo poctivců, paní Müllerová. Já si představuju, že se pan arcivévoda Ferdinand také v tom Sa­rajevu zmejlil v tom člověkovi, co ho střelil. Viděl nějakého pána a myslil si: To je nějakej pořádnej člověk, když mně volá slávu. A zatím ho ten pán bouch. Dal mu jednu nebo několik?”","""He hung himself on the kshanda,"" said Schweik, wearing a clean hard hat. ""And that kshanda wasn't his either. He borrowed from the professor that his pants were falling. Did he have to wait for him to be shot? Mrs Müller knows that everyone's head is in such a situation. Profousa was demoted for it and given him six months. But he didn't sit them out. Escape to Švejcar and today there is a church preacher there. There are few honesty today, Mrs Müller. I imagine that Archduke Ferdinand also made fun of the man who shot him in Sarajevo. He saw a gentleman and thought: He is a good man when he calls me glory. And in the meantime, the lord bangs him. Did he give him one or more? ”","“He hung himself with suspenders,” answered Švejk, brushing off his felt hat. “And the suspenders weren’t even his. He borrowed them from the prison guard by telling him that his pants were falling down. What was he supposed to do? Wait until they shot him? “You know Mrs. Müller, everyone’s head spins in a situation like that. The prison guard was demoted and given six months in jail. But he didn’t do all of his time. He ran off to Switzerland and today he is a preacher of some church denomination there. “Nowadays, there are few straight shooters, Mrs. Müller. I imagine the old Archduke Ferdinand in that Sarajevo misjudged the man who shot him. He saw someone dressed as a gentleman and said to himself: ‘There’s a fine, upstanding citizen! He’s chanting that I should live long.’ And then, that properly dressed gentleman blew him away. Did he shoot him once or several times?”","""He hanged himself with a pair of braces,"" said Schweik, brushing his bowler hat. ""And the braces wasn't even his. He borrowed them from a jailer, making out that his trousers were coming down. You can't blame him for not waiting till they shot him. You know, Mrs. Muller, it's enough to turn anyone's head, being in a fix like that. The jailer lost his rank and got six months as well. But he didn't serve his time. He ran away to Switzerland and now he does a bit of preaching for some church or other. There ain't many honest people about nowadays, Mrs. Muller. I expect that the Archduke was taken in by the man who shot him. He saw a chap standing there and thought : Now there's a decent fellow, cheering me and all. And then the chap did him in. Did he give him one or several?"""

"„Tak vidíte,” řekl Švejk, „to všechno každej musí zkusit pro císaře pána. I to pumpování žaludku, i ten klystýr. Když jsem sloužil před léty u mýho regimentu, bejvalo to ještě hor­ší. To takovýho maroda svázali do kozelce a hodili do díry, aby se vykurýroval. To nebyly žádný postele s kavalci jako zde nebo plivátka. Holá pryčna a na tej leželi marodi. Jednou měl jeden vopravdovskej tyfus a druhej vedle něho černý ne­štovice. Voba byli svázaní do kozelce a regimentsarct je kopal do břicha, že jsou prej simulanti. Pak když ty voba vojáci umřeli, přišlo to do parlamentu a bylo to v novinách. Ty novi­ny hned nám zakázali číst a dělali prohlídku v kufříkách, kdo má ty noviny. A jak už mám vždycky to neštěstí, u celýho regimentu je u nikoho nenašli než u mě. Tak mne vedli k regimentsraportu a náš obršt, takovej vůl, dej mu pánbůh nebe, začal na mne řvát, abych stál rovně a řek, kdo to do těch novin napsal, nebo že mně roztrhne hubu od ucha k uchu a dá mě zavřít, až budu černej. Potom přišel regimentsarct, šermoval mně pěstí pod nosem a křičel: ,Sie verfluchter Hund, Sie schäbiges Wesen, Sie unglückliches Mistvieh, ty kluku socia­listická!' Dívám se všem upřímně do očí, ani nemrknu a ml­čím, ruku na čepici a levou na faldě kalhot. Běhali kolem mne jako psi, štěkali na mne, a já pořád nic. Mlčím, vzdávám čest a levá ruka na faldě kalhot. Když tak řádili asi půl hodiny, rozběhl se obršt ke mně a zařval: ,Jsi blbec, nebo nejsi blbec?' — ,Poslušně hlásím, pane obršt, že jsem blbec.' — ,Jednadva­cet dní tuhého vězení pro blbost, dva půsty týdně, měsíc kasárníka, osumačtyřicet hodin špangle, hned zavřít, nedat mu žrát, svázat ho, ukázat mu, že erár blbce nepotřebuje. My už ti, holomku, noviny vytlučem z hlavy,' rozhodl se po dlouhým lítání pan obršt. — Zatímco jsem seděl, děly se v kasárnách divy. Náš obršt zakázal vůbec vojákům číst, třebas by to byly i Pražské úřední noviny, v kantýně nesměli balit do novin ani párky, ani syrečky. Vod tý doby vojáci začli číst a náš regi­ment byl nejvzdělanější. Četli jsme všechny noviny a u každý kumpačky skládali veršíčky, písničky proti panu obrštovi. A když se něco u regimentu stalo, tak se vždycky našel mezi manšaftem nějakej dobrodinec, kerej to dal do novin pod ná­zvem ,Tejrání vojáků'. A na tom neměli dost. Psali poslancům do Vídně, aby se jich ujmuli, a ti začali dávat interpelaci jed­nu za druhou, že je náš pan obršt zvíře a podobně. Nějakej ministr poslal k nám komisi, aby to vyšetřila, a nějakej Fran­ta Henčlů z Hluboký dostal potom dva roky, poněvadž to byl ten, co se vobrátil do Vídně k poslancům kvůli tý facce, kerou dostal na cvičišti od pana obršta. Potom, když komise vodjela, dal si nás pan obršt všechny seřadit, celej regiment, a povídá, že voják je voják, že musí držet hubu a sloužit, jestli se mu něco nelíbí, tak že je to porušení subordinace. ,Tak jste si, lumpové, mysleli, že vám ta komise pomůže,' povídá pan obršt, ,drek vám pomohla. A teď bude každá kumpačka kolem mne defilírovat a opakovat hlasitě, co jsem řekl.' — Tak jsme šli jedna kumpačka za druhou, rechtsšaut, kde stál pan obršt, ruku na řemeni flinty, a řvali jsme na něho: ,Tak jsme si, lumpové, mysleli, že nám ta komise pomůže, drek nám po­mohla.' — Pan obršt se smál, až se za břicho popadal, až defilírovala jedenáctá kumpačka. Jde, dupe, a když přijde k panu obrštovi, nic, ticho, ani hlásku. Pan obršt se začervenal jako kohout a vrátil jedenáctou kumpačku, aby to ještě jednou opakovala. Defilíruje a mlčí, jen řada za řadou se drze dívá panu obrštovi do očí. — ,Ruht!' povídá pan obršt a chodí po dvoře, seká si bičíkem přes holínky, plivá, pak najednou se zastaví a zařve ,Abtreten!', sedne si na svou herku a už je z brány venku. Čekali jsme, co se stane s jedenáctou kumpačkou, a ono nic. Čekáme jeden den, druhý den, celý týden, a ono pořád nic. Pan obršt se v kasárnách vůbec neobjevil, z čehož mělo mužstvo, šarže i důstojníci velkou radost. Potom jsme dostali nového obršta a o tom starém se povídalo, že je v nějakém sanatoriu, poněvadž napsal vlastnoruční dopis k císaři pánovi, že se jedenáctá kumpačka vzbouřila.”","""So you see,"" said Schweik, ""everyone must try all this for the emperor. Even the pumping of the stomach, even the enema. When I served with my regiment years ago, it used to be even worse. They tied such a maraud to a goat and threw it in a hole to heat up. These were no beds with cots like here or spittoons. Bare gutter and the Marodi lay on it. One had one typhus and the other had smallpox. Voba was tied up in a goat and the regimentsarct is kicked in the stomach, they are prek simulators. Then when the vob soldiers died, it came to parliament and it was in the newspapers. They immediately forbade us to read the newspaper and inspected who had the newspaper in their briefcases. And as I always have the misfortune, the whole regiment did not find them with anyone but me. So they led me to regimentsraport and our giant, such an ox, give him the god of heaven, began to yell at me to stand up straight and say who wrote it in the newspaper, or that he would rip my mouth from ear to ear and have me shut until I'll be black. Then came the regimentsarct, fencing me with my fist under my nose and shouting: 'Sie verfluchter Hund, Sie schäbiges Wesen, Sie unglückliches Mistvieh, ty boy socialist!' I look everyone in the eye sincerely, I don't even blink and remain silent, my hand on my hat and my left on the fold of my pants. They ran around me like dogs, barking at me, and I still nothing.

We'll beat the newspaper out of your head, holomka, 'decided Mr. Obrst, after a long flight. - While I was sitting, wonders were happening in the barracks. Our giant forbade the soldiers to read at all, even if it was the Prague official newspaper, they were not allowed to pack sausages or cheese in the newspapers in the canteen. The soldiers began to read the water of that time, and our regiment was the most educated. We read all the newspapers and wrote poems, songs against Mr. Obrstov, for each of them. And when something happened to the regiment, there was always a benefactor among the crews, who put it in the newspaper under the name 'Soldiers' Abduction'. And they didn't have enough. They wrote to the deputies in Vienna to take care of them, and they began to give interpellation one by one, that our lord is a giant animal and so on. A minister sent a commission to us to investigate, and he then got a Frant Henčl from Hluboký for two years, because he was the one who returned to Vienna to the deputies because of the facade he had received at the training ground from Mr. Obrst. Then, as the commission led, Mr. Obr took us all together, the entire regiment, and said that the soldier was a soldier, that he had to shut up and serve if he didn't like something, so that it was a violation of subordination. ""So, you crooks, you thought the commission would help you,"" says Mr. Obrst, ""Drek helped you."" And now every girl around me will parade and repeat what I said aloud. ' ""So we went one pick after another, the Rechtschaut, where Mr. Obrst was standing, his hand on the flint belt, and we shouted at him, 'So we, rogues, thought the commission would help us, the dragon helped us.' ""Mr. Obr laughed as he grabbed his stomach, the eleventh dump was defiled. Come on, dupe, and when he comes to Mr. Obrst, nothing, silence, not a sound. Mr. Obrst blushed like a rooster and returned the eleventh pump to repeat. He defiles and is silent, only row after row staring rudely into Mr. Obrst's eyes. - 'Ruht!' says Mr. Obrst and walks around the yard, cuts his whip over his boots, spits, then suddenly stops and yells, 'Abtreten!', sits down at his play and is out of the gate. We were waiting for what would happen to the eleventh dumpster, and nothing. We wait one day, another day, all week, and still nothing. Mr. Obrst did not appear in the barracks at all, which made the team, batches and officers very happy. Then we were given a new convent, and the old one was said to be in a sanatorium because he had written a handwritten letter to the emperor, the lord, that the eleventh cave had revolted. ""","“So, you see, all these things must be suffered for the Lord Emperor,” Švejk said. “Even stomach pumping or an enema. When I was serving with my regiment years ago, it was worse yet. They’d hog-tie a sick man and throw him in the hole, so that he would get better. “In those days, there were no nice bunks like these, or spittoons, either. There were just bare planks with sick men lying on them. Once, one of the boys really had true case of typhus. And, the one next to him had small pox. Both were hog-tied and the regiment’s doctor kicked them in the stomach, saying that they were malingerers. When both those soldiers died, it got into the newspapers and was mentioned in the parliament. They immediately forbade us to read the newspapers and conducted a search through our footlockers, trying to find hidden ones. “I always have all the bad luck. Out of the whole regiment, they didn’t find anyone with newspapers, except me. So, they put me on regimental report and escorted me to our colonel. Lord God, he was such an ox. He started screaming at me, ordering me to stand straight and tell him who it was who gave the information to the newspapers. Otherwise, he said he’d rip my mouth ear to ear and have me locked up until I turned black. “Next came the regiment’s doctor, swinging his fist under my nose and screaming: ‘Sie verfluchter Hund! Sie schabiges Wesen! Sie unglucklich Mistvieh! You runaway dog! You shabby beast! You unlucky hunk of barnyard crap! -- You socialist punk!’ “I looked them all sincerely in the eyes and didn’t blink. I kept very quiet, my right hand on my cap and my left on the crease of my pants. After they had gone crazy for about half an hour, the Colonel ran toward me screaming: ‘Are you an idiot?! Or, are you not an idiot?!’ “I replied calmly: ‘I obediently report, Colonel Sir, that I am an idiot.’ “The Colonel replied with a long litany: ‘Lock him up for idiocy! Confine him to the barracks! Put him in manacles for forty-eight hours! Give him 21 days of strict regimen -- two days of fasting a week! Make sure to lock him up immediately! Make sure no one feeds him! Bind him up and show him that the military doesn’t need idiots! We will, you churl, knock that newspaper nonsense out of your head!’ “While I sat there doing my time, wonders were happening in the garrison. Our Colonel forbade the soldiers to read anything, even the Prague Official Newspaper. In the mess, they couldn’t even wrap hot dogs or Limburger cheese in these papers. “From that time on, our soldiers became big readers. Our regiment became the most educated in the army. They read all the newspapers and, in every company, they composed little verses and songs about the Colonel. “When something would happen, one of the men, some good soul, would always put the story in the newspaper under the title ‘Cruel Maltreatment of Soldiers.’ And, as if that wasn’t enough, they’d write to the parliamentary deputies in Vienna, asking that they stand up for them. Those deputies started making one motion after another, declaring that our Colonel was an animal, and more of the like. “Franta Hencl from Hluboká complained to the deputies in Vienna because the colonel slapped him on the training ground. Some minister of the government sent a commission to investigate. After the commission left, Franta Hencl got two years in prison. “The colonel had us all fall in, the whole regiment. He said that a soldier is a soldier, that he must shut his trap and keep on serving. If there was something the colonel really didn’t like, it was insubordination. The colonel told us: ‘So! You hoodlums thought that the commission would help you. Like shit it did. And now each company will march in formation before me and loudly repeat everything I have said.’ “One company after another marched, right-faced, to where the colonel stood. With one hand on the slings of our rifles, we shouted at him: ‘So! We hoodlums thought that the commission would help us! Like shit it did!’ “Our colonel laughed so hard that he kept grabbing his gut. That is, until the 11th Company marched by in formation. They came along stomping hard. But, when they reached the colonel: nothing. Silence. Not even a tiny sound. The colonel turned red like a rooster. He sent the eleventh company back and commanded them to do it again as he had ordered. They marched back again in formation, rank after rank, and stared at the colonel just as insolently as before. “‘Ruht! At ease!’ the colonel said, pacing up and down, lashing at his boots with a riding whip and spitting. All of a sudden, he stops and screams: Abtreten! Fall out!’ He then mounted his old nag and rode out through the gate. We were waiting to see what would happen to the 11th Company. Lo and behold, nothing. We waited a day, then the second day, and then the whole week. Lo and behold, still nothing. “The colonel didn’t show up at the garrison at all. All the men -- all the non-commissioned officers, and all the officers -- were very glad. We got a new colonel and it was rumored that the old one was in some kind of sanitarium because he wrote a letter, in his own hand, to the Lord Emperor, accusing the 11th Company of mutiny.”","""Well,"" said Schweik, ""you see what you've all got to go through for the Emperor. Even having your stomachs pumped out. When I was in the army years ago, it used to be much worse. If a man went sick, they just trussed him up, shoved him into a cell to make him get fitter. There wasn't any beds and mattresses and spittoons like what there is here. Just a bare bench for them to lie on. Once there was a chap who had typhus, fair and square, and the one next to him had smallpox. Well, they trussed them both up and the M. O. kicked them in the ribs and said they were shamming. When the pair of them kicked the bucket, there was a dust-up in Parliament and it got into the papers. Like a shot they stopped us from reading the papers and all our boxes was inspected to see if we'd got any hidden there. And it was just my luck that in the whole blessed regiment there was nobody but me whose newspaper was spotted. So I was had up in the orderly room and our colonel, silly old buffer, God rest his soul, starts yelling at me to stand to attention and tell him who'd written that stuff to the paper or he'd smash my jaw from ear to ear and keep me in clink till all was blue. Then the M.O. comes up and he shakes his fist right under my nose and shouts: 'You misbegotten whelp ; you scabby ape ; you wretched blob of scum ; you skunk of a Socialist, you !' Well, I looks 'em straight in the face, without moving an eyelid, and there I stood keeping my mouth shut and with one hand at the salute and the other along the seam of my trousers. There they was, running round and yelping at me like a couple of puppies, and I just kept standing there and saying nothing. I keeps my mouth shut, salutes and holds my left hand along the seam of my trousers. When they'd been carrying on like that for about half an hour, the Colonel dashes up to me and yells : 'Are you an idiot or ain't you?' ' Beg to report, sir,' I says, 'that I'm an idiot.' Well, after a lot of rushing about the Colonel decides to give me twenty-one days' solitary confinement for being an idiot, two days per week without any grub, a month's C.B., forty-eight hours in irons. ' Lock him up on the spot,' he says. ' Don't give him anything to eat; tie him hand and foot; show him the army doesn't need any idiots. We'll knock the newspaper nonsense out of your head, you ruffian,' he says. Well, while I was serving my time, there was some rum goings-on in the barracks. Our colonel stopped the troops from reading at all, and in the canteen they wasn't allowed even to wrap up sausages or cheese in newspapers. That made the soldiers start reading and our regiment had all the rest beat when it came to showing how much they'd learned. We used to read all the papers and in every company there were chaps who made up verses and songs guying the Colonel. And whenever anything happened in the regiment there was always some smart chap among the rank and file who wrote a bit about it to the papers and called it 'Soldiers Tortured.' And that wasn't enough for them, mind you. Why, they used to write to our M. P.'s at Vienna asking them to take their part, and so they began to ask questions in Parliament, one after another, all about our colonel being a brute and that sort of stuff. Some minister or other sent a commission to look into it, and in the end a chap named Franta Henclu got two years, because he was the one who had complained to the M. P.'s in Vienna about a smack in the eye that he got from the Colonel on the parade-ground. Afterward, when the commission had cleared off, the Colonel had us all drawn up, the whole blessed regiment, and he says, a soldier's a soldier and he's got to hold his tongue and do his duty, and if there's anything he doesn't like, then it's infringement of subordination. ' You gang of ruffians,' he says, 'you thought the commission was going to help you. Well, it helped you damn well,' he says. And now you'll march past me company by company and repeat aloud what I've just said.' So away we went, one company after another, eyes right, with our hands on our rifle-straps and yelled at the Colonel : ' You gang of ruffians ; you thought the commission was going to help you. Well, it helped you damn well.' The Colonel was laughing fit to bust, till the eleventh company marches past. Up they came, stamping their feet, but when they got alongside the Colonel they never said a word. The Colonel turns as red as a beetroot and sends the eleventh company back to do it all over again. They march past and keep their mouths shut, but each file as it came up just stares at the Colonel as bold as brass. ' Ruht!'1 says the Colonel and walks across the barrack square, cracking his whip across his top-boots. Then he spits and suddenly comes to a standstill and yells ' Abtreten!'2mounts his old nag and was outside the gate like a shot. We was waiting for the eleventh company to cop out, but nothing happened. We waited one day, two days, a whole week, and still nothing happened. There was no sign of the Colonel in the barracks, and everybody—men, N. C. O.'s and officers was all chortling about it. Then we got a new colonel and we heard that the old one was in a sanatorium or something because he'd written a letter to the Emperor to tell him that the eleventh company had mutinied."""

"„Je to s námi se všemi moc špatný,” začal svá slova útě­chy, „to není pravda, jak vy říkáte, že se vám, nám všem ne­může nic stát. Vod čeho máme policii než vod toho, aby nás trestala za naše huby. Jestli je taková nebezpečná doba, že střílejí arcivévody, tak se nikdo nesmí divit, že ho vedou na direkci. To se všechno dělá kvůli lesku, aby měl Ferdinand reklamu před svým pohřbem. Čím víc nás tady bude, tím to bude pro nás lepší, poněvadž nám bude veselejc. Když jsem sloužil na vojně, byla nás někdy zavřená polovina kumpačky. A co nevinnejch lidí bejvávalo odsouzeno. A nejen na vojně, ale i soudama. Jednou se pamatuji, jedna ženská byla odsou­zena, že uškrtila svoje novorozená dvojčata. Ačkoliv se zapří­sahala, že nemohla uškrtit dvojčata, když se jí narodila jen jedna holčička, kterou se jí podařilo uškrtit docela bez bolesti, byla odsouzena přece jen pro dvojnásobnou vraždu. Nebo ten nevinnej cikán v Záběhlicích, co se vloupal do toho hokynářskýho krámu na Boží hod vánoční v noci. Zapřísáh se, že se šel vohřát, ale nic mu to nepomohlo. Jak už něco soud vezme do ruky, je zle. Ale to zle musí bejt. Třebas všichni lidi nejsou takoví darebáci, jak se to o nich dá předpokládat; ale jak po­znáš dneska toho hodnýho od toho lumpa, zejména dnes, v takový vážný době, kdy toho Ferdinanda odpráskli. To u nás, když jsem sloužil na vojně v Budějovicích, zastřelili v lese za cvičištěm psa panu hejtmanovi. Když se o tom dově­děl, zavolal si nás všechny, postavil a povídá, ať vystoupí kaž­dý desátý muž. Já, samo sebou se rozumí, byl jsem taky desá­tý, a tak jsme stáli habacht a ani nemrkli. Hejtman chodí kolem nás a povídá: ,Vy lumpové, padouchové, neřádi, hyeny skvrnitý, tak bych vám chtěl kvůli tomu psovi všem napařit ajnclíka, rozsekat vás na nudle, postřílet a udělat z vás kapra namodro. Abyste ale věděli, že vás nebudu šetřit, dávám vám všem na čtrnáct dní kasárníka.' Tak vidíte, tenkrát se jednalo o pejska, a teď se jedná dokonce o pana arcivévodu. A proto musí bejt hrůza, aby ten smutek stál za něco.”","""It's too bad for all of us,"" he began his words of consolation, ""it's not true, as you say, nothing can happen to you all of us. What do we have for the police than for us to punish us for our mushrooms. If it's such a dangerous time that they're shooting archdukes, no one should be surprised that they're leading him to direct. This is all done for the sake of Ferdinand to have an advertisement before his funeral. The more of us there are, the better it will be for us, because it will make us happier. When I served in the military, we were sometimes locked up in half a dumpster. And what innocent people used to be condemned. And not only in the war, but also in the courts. One day I remember a woman was convicted of strangling her newborn twins. Although she swore that she could not strangle the twins when she gave birth to only one girl, whom she managed to strangle quite painlessly, she was convicted of double murder. Or the innocent gypsy in Záběhlice who broke into that grocery store for Christmas Eve at night. He swore he went to warm up, but it didn't help. It is wrong for the court to take matters into its own hands. But it must be bad. Although not all people are as villains as can be expected; but how do you know the good one from that crook today, especially today, at such a serious time when Ferdinand was spanked. In our country, when I served in the war in Budějovice, Mr. Hejtman was shot dead in the woods behind the training ground. When he found out, he called us all, stood up, and told every tenth man to come out. I, of course, was also tenth, so we stood habacht and didn't even blink. The governor walks around us and says: 'You crooks, villains, messes, spotted hyenas, so I'd like to steam all your dogs for this dog, chop you into noodles, shoot you and make you a blue carp. But that you may know that I will not spare you, I give you all a barracks for a fortnight. ' So you see, it was a dog then, and now it's even the Archduke. That is why it must be terrible for the sadness to be worth something. ”","“It’s very bad for us all,” he began. “It is not true, as some of you have been saying, that nothing really bad can happen to us. What do we have the police for? For one purpose, to punish us for our bad mouths. If the times are so dangerous that they’re shooting archdukes, then nobody should be surprised when they take him to the police station. All of this is done for show, so that Ferdinand will have publicity before his state funeral. The more of us there are here, the better it’ll be for us. We can cheer each other up. “When I was serving in the military, sometimes half the outfit was locked up. And, many innocent people were found guilty. This happens not only in the military, but in the civilian courts too. I remember once some crazy woman was found guilty for having strangled her newborn twins. She swore that she couldn’t have strangled twins since she had given birth to only one little girl, whom she had managed to strangle quite painlessly. She was found guilty, nevertheless, of double murder. Or, the innocent gypsy in Zábehlice who broke into that grocery store on Christmas night. He swore that he went there to warm up. But that didn’t help him at all. “Once a court takes something in hand, it’s trouble. But that trouble is necessary. Perhaps, every person is not such a hoodlum as he can sometimes seem to be. But how can you tell the good one from the shyster? Especially today, during such serious times, when even that Ferdinand can be blown away. “Where I served in the military, in Budejovice, they shot the captain’s dog in a forest on the other side of the training ground. When he found out about it, he called us all together and had us stand at attention. He says that every tenth man should step forward. It goes without saying, that I also was tenth. So, we stood at habacht, attention, and didn’t as much as blink. The captain is walking around us and spouting: ‘You hoodlums. You scoundrels. You scum. You spotted hyenas. I would so love to slam you into solitary for that dog, then chop you into noodles. Or blast away. Mow you down and turn you into carp a la blue. Think I’m going soft on you? I’m giving you all two weeks of confinement to the barracks!’ “So there. And, that was just the matter of a doggie. Now, it’s the matter of the Royal Archduke. And, that’s why there has to be fear, so that mourning for the archduke will be worth something.”","""We're all in the deuce of a mess,"" he began his words of comfort. "" You say that nothing can happen to you, to all of us, but you're wrong. What have we got the police for except to punish us for letting our tongues wag? If the times are so dangerous that archdukes get shot, the likes of us mustn't be surprised if we're taken up before the beak. They're doing all this to make a bit of a splash, so that Ferdinand'U be in the limelight before his funeral. The more of us there are, the better it'll be for us, because we'll feel all the jollier. When I was in the army, sometimes half the company were shoved into clink. And lots of innocent men used to get punished. Not only in the army, in the law courts, too. Once I remember there was a woman who was sentenced for strangling her newborn twins. Although she swore she couldn't have strangled the twins, because she's only had one baby, a female one, that she managed to strangle quite painlessly, she was sentenced for double murder. Once the court takes a thing up, there's trouble. But there's bound to be trouble. It may be that not all people are such crooks as they're taken for. But nowadays how are you going to tell an honest man from a crook, especially now in these grave times when Ferdinand got done in. When I was in the army the captain's pet dog got shot in the wood behind the parade ground. When he heard about it, he called us all out on parade and ordered every tenth man to step one pace forward. Of course, I was a tenth man, and there we stood at attention without moving an eyelash. The captain walked round us and said : 'You blackguards, you ruffians, you scum, you scabby brutes, I'd like to shove the whole gang of you into solitary confinement over that dog. I'd chop you into mincemeat, I'd shoot you and have you turned into stew. But just to show you that I'm not going to treat you leniently, I'm giving you all fourteen days C. B.' You see, that time the trouble was over a dog, but a fullblown archduke's at the bottom of it all. That's why they've got to put the fear of God into people, so as to make the trouble worth while."""

"Vrátiv se do své komory, oznámil Švejk všem zatčeným, že takový výslech je legrace. „Trochu tam na vás křičí a na­konec vás vyženou. — Dřív,” pokračoval Švejk, „to bejvávalo horší. Četl jsem kdysi jednu knihu, že obžalovaní museli cho­dit po rozžhaveným železe a pít roztavené olovo, aby se po­znalo, jestli je nevinnej. Nebo mu dali nohy do španělský boty a natáhli ho na žebřík, když se nechtěl přiznat, nebo mu pálili boky hasičskou pochodní, jako to udělali svatému Janu Nepo­muckému. Ten prej řval při tom, jako když ho na nože bere, a nepřestal, dokud ho neshodili z Eliščina mostu v nepromo­kavým pytli. Takovejch případů bylo víc a ještě potom člově­ka čtvrtili nebo narazili na kůl někde u Muzea. A když ho hodili jenom do lidomorny, to se takovej člověk cítil jako znovuzrozenej. — Dneska je to legrace, bejt zavřenej,” liboval si Švejk dále, „žádný čtvrcení, žádný španělský boty, kavalce máme, stůl máme, lavici máme, nemačkáme se jeden na druhýho, polévku dostanem, chleba nám dají, džbán vody přine­sou, záchod máme přímo pod hubou.

To vedou jednoho sem, druhého tam, mladýho, starýho, mužskýho i ženskýho pohlaví. Máte radost, že tady aspoň nejste sám. Každej jde spokojeně svou cestou a nemusí se obávat, že mu v kanceláři řeknou: ,Tak jsme se poradili a zejtra budete rozčtvrcenej nebo upálenej, podle vašeho vlastního přání.' To bylo jistě těžký rozmýšlení a já myslím, pánové, že by mnohej z nás v takovej moment byl celej zaraženej. Jó, dneska už se poměry zlepšily k našemu dobru.”","Returning to his chamber, Schweik announced to all those arrested that such an interrogation was fun. ""They're shouting at you a little there and they'll kick you out in the end. ""Before,"" Schweik continued, ""it used to be worse. I once read a book that defendants had to walk on red-hot iron and drink molten lead to see if he was innocent. Or they put his feet in his Spanish boots and stretched him on a ladder when he did not want to confess, or they burned his hips with a fire torch, as they did to St. John of Nepomuk. He roared like he was taking him on his knives, and he didn't stop until he was thrown from Eliška's bridge in a waterproof sack. There were more such cases, and even then a person was quartered or hit a stake somewhere near the Museum. And when he was only thrown into a manor house, such a person felt reborn. - Today it's fun, be closed, ""Švejk added,"" no quarter, no Spanish shoes, we have a cot, we have a table, we have a bench, we don't squeeze each other, we get soup, they give us bread, they bring a pitcher of water, a toilet we have right under our mouths. Progress can be seen in everything. A little, it's true, it's a long way to interrogate, until you walk upstairs through three corridors, but clean and lively in the corridors. This leads one here, the other there, young, old, male and female. You're glad you're not alone here. Everyone is happy with their journey and does not have to worry about being told in the office: 'So we have consulted and tomorrow you will be quartered or burnt, according to your own wishes.' It was certainly a difficult thought, and I think, gentlemen, that many of us would be stunned at such a moment. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either. ”","Upon his return, Švejk informed the others that this type of interrogation could be fun. “They scream at you a bit. Then, in the end, they chase you out. In the old days, it used to be worse. I read in a book once that a suspect used to have to walk on red hot iron and drink molten lead to determine whether or not he was innocent. Or, they put his feet in the Spanish boots and jacked him up on the rack, when he didn’t want to confess. Or, they burned his sides with a fireman’s torch, like they did to Saint Jan Nepomucký, who they say screamed as if they were lifting him up on the tips of knives. They say he didn’t stop screaming until they threw him from the Eliška bridge in a water-proof bag. “There were many such cases. In those days, they would still quarter a man, or impale him on something somewhere by the Museum. When they decided to only throw him into the hunger pit, such a man felt like he was being given a new lease on life. “Nowadays, it is easy and fun to be locked up,” Švejk continued with delight. “No quartering, no Spanish boots. We have bunks, a table, and a bench. We’re not crammed together. We get soup. They give us bread. They bring us jars of water. The toilet is right under our nose. You can see many improvements. In all this you can see there is progress. True, it’s a little bit too far to go to be interrogated, all the way across three corridors and one floor up. But, on the other hand, the corridors are clean and full of life. “They take one here, another there; a young one, an old one, a male, and even a female. You’re glad that at least you’re not here alone. Everybody goes contentedly on his way. He doesn’t have to fear that the officials will tell him: ‘We consulted one another and, tomorrow, you’ll be quartered, or burned at the stake, according to your own wish.’ That would certainly be a tough decision to think about. In a moment like that, gentlemen, I think that many of you could easily be frustrated until you’re stumped. Nowadays, the conditions have improved so much, it’s to our benefit.”","Having been deposited in his cell again, Schweik informed all the prisoners that the cross-examination was great fun. ""They yell at you a bit and then kick you out."" He paused a moment. "" In olden times,"" continued Schweik, ""it used to be much worse. I once read a book where it said that people charged with anything had to walk on red-hot iron and drink molten lead to see whether they was innocent or not. There was lots who was treated like that and then on top of it all they was quartered or put in the pillory somewhere near the Natural History Museum. ""Nowadays, it's great fun being run in,"" continued Schweik with relish. ""There's no quartering or anything of that kind. We've got a mattress, we've got a table, we've got a seat, we ain't packed together like sardines , we'll get soup, they'll give us bread, they'll bring a pitcher of water, there's a closet right under our noses. It all shows you what progress there's been. Of course, it's rather a long way to the place where you're cross-examined, along three corridors and up one flight of stairs, but the corridors are clean and there's plenty going on in them. Some are being taken one way, others the opposite way, young and old, male and female. It's nice to know you're not alone. They all go wherever they're taken and they're absolutely satisfied, because they're not afraid of being told in the bureau : 'We've talked your case over and to-morrow you'll be quartered or burned alive, according as you prefer.' That must have been a nasty thing to have to look forward to, and I think, gentlemen, that it would have upset a good many of us. Ah, yes, nowadays things have improved for our benefit."""

"Oba přátelé si opět ťukli. Ještě když Švejk se živil prode­jem psů do vojny, Blahník mu je dodával. Byl to zkušený muž a vypravovalo se o něm, že kupoval pod rukou z pohodnice podezřelé psy a zas je prodával dál. Měl dokonce už jednou vzteklinu a v Pasteurově ústavu ve Vídni byl jako doma. Nyní považoval za svou povinnost nezištně vojákovi Švejkovi po­moci. Znal všechny psy v celé Praze i okolí, a mluvil proto tak tiše, aby se hostinskému neprozradil, poněvadž mu z hostince před půlrokem odnesl pod kabátem štěně, jezevčíka, kterému dal cucat mléko z dětské láhve, takže ho hloupé štěně patrně považovalo za mámu a ani nedutalo pod kabátem.","Both friends tapped again. Even when Švejk made a living selling dogs to the war, Blahník supplied them to him. He was an experienced man, and it was said that he bought suspicious dogs under his arm and sold them again. He had even had rabies once and was at home at the Pasteur Institute in Vienna. He now considered it his duty to help the soldier Švejk selflessly. He knew all the dogs in Prague and the surrounding area, so he spoke so softly that he would not reveal himself to the innkeeper, because he took a puppy from his inn six months ago under his coat, a dachshund who sucked milk from a baby bottle, so the stupid puppy probably considered him a mother and it didn't even tuck under its coat.","The friends clinked their steins again. Before the war, when Švejk was still making his living selling dogs, Blahník was his chief supplier. He was an experienced man. It was rumored that he bought questionable dogs from a carrion collector and then resold them. He had even caught rabies. He had been in the Pasteur Institute in Vienna so often, it was like his second home. Now, he viewed it as his duty to selflessly help the good soldier, Švejk. He was knowledgeable about all the dogs in the whole city of Prague, and its vicinity. He spoke quietly. He did not want to reveal himself to the pubkeeper. He had tucked the pubkeeper’s puppy under his coat half a year ago, and stolen him. It was a dachshund. He gave it milk to suck out of a baby bottle. The stupid puppy apparently took him for its mommy and didn’t as much as breath under his coat.","The two friends again clinked glasses. It was from Blahnik that Schweik had obtained his supply of dogs when he used to deal in them before joining the army. And now that Schweik was a soldier, Blahnik considered it his duty to assist him in a disinterested spirit. He knew every dog in the whole of Prague and environs, and on principle he stole only thoroughbred dogs."

"A tak zasáhl dobrý voják Švejk do světové války svým milým, roztomilým způsobem. Historiky bude zajímat, že on viděl daleko do budoucnosti.

"„Jak to myslím?” odvětil spokojeně Švejk. „Docela jenom takhle.

Když to povážím, strýc císaře pána, a voni ho zastřelejí. Vždyť je to ostuda, jsou toho plný noviny. U nás před léty v Budějovicích probodli na trhu v nějaké takové malé hádce jednoho obchodníka s dobytkem, nějakého Břeti­slava Ludvíka. Ten měl syna Bohuslava, a kam přišel prodávat prasata, nikdo od něho nic nekoupil a každý říkal: „To je syn toho probodnutýho, to bude asi také pěknej lump.” Musel skočit v Krumlově z toho mostu do Vltavy a museli ho vytáhnout, museli ho křísit, museli z něho pumpovat vodu a von jim musel skonat v náručí lékaře, když mu dal nějakou injekci.”","""What do I mean?"" Schweik replied contentedly. ""It's just like that. If he had been fatter, he would have been struck by a stroke before when he chased the grandmothers in Konopiště, when there were grids and mushrooms in his area, and he didn't have to die such a disgraceful death. When I consider it, the emperor's uncle and the smell shoot him. It's a shame, the newspapers are full of it. Years ago in Budějovice, one cattle dealer, a Břetislav Ludvík, stabbed the market in such a small quarrel. He had a son, Bohuslav, and where he came to sell pigs, no one bought anything from him, and everyone said, ""He's the son of the pierced one, he'll probably be a nice crook, too."" He had to jump from the bridge to the Vltava in Krumlov and they had to pull it out, they had to raise it, they had to pump water out of it, and he had to die in the arms of a doctor when he gave him an injection. ”","“How do I mean that?” Švejk echoed the policeman calmly. “Only this: Had he been fatter, he would surely have been hit with a stroke before this. Maybe, when he was chasing after those old broads collecting mushrooms and twigs at his estate at Konopište. He didn’t have to die such a shameful death. Think about it. A nephew of the Lord Emperor and they shoot him dead. Now, that’s scandalous. The newspapers are full of it. “Years ago, by us in Budejovice, during one of those petty arguments in the marketplace, some guys stabbed a livestock dealer named Bretislav Ludvík. He had a son Bohuslav. But, after that, whenever the son came to sell pigs, nobody bought anything from him. Everybody would say, ‘That’s the son of that shyster who was stabbed. He’s got to be a crook, too.’ He jumped right into the Vltava River from that bridge in Krumlov. They pulled him out and tried to revive him. They pumped water out of him. They went through all that, but he died anyway in the doctor’s arms from an injection he gave him.”","""What do I mean?"" replied Schweik composedly. ""Why, only just this: If he'd been fatter, he'd certainly have had a stroke earlier, when he chased the old women away at Konopiste, when they were gathering firewood and mushrooms on his preserves there, and then he wouldn't have died such a shocking death. When you come to think of it, for him, the Emperor's uncle, to get shot like that, oh, it's shocking, that it is, and the newspapers are full of it."

Načež dostával taktéž stereotypní odpověď:,He also received a stereotypical answer:,"To this, he was getting only one answer:",Whereupon he had received an equally stereotyped reply :
"„A bylo v banku hodně?” otázal se Švejk klidně, „nebo jste málokdy dělal forhonta? Když nepadá karta, je to velmi špat­né, ale někdy je to mizérie, když to jde až příliš dobře. Na Zderaze žil nějakej klempíř Vejvoda a ten hrával vždy mariáš v jedné hospodě za Stoletou kavárnou. Jednou taky, čert mu to napískal, povídá: A což abychom si hodili jedníka o pětníček.' Hráli tedy pětníčkovýho jedníka a on držel bank. Všich­ni se ztropili a tak to rostlo do desítky. Starej Vejvoda chtěl popřát taky druhýmu něco a pořád říkal: ,Malá, špatná domů.' To si nedovedete představit, jakou měl smůlu. Malá špatná ne a ne přijít, bank rost, a už tam byla stovka. Z hráčů nikdo tolik neměl, aby to mohl hopnout, a Vejvoda už byl celej upo­cenej. Nebylo nic jinýho slyšet než jeho: ,Malá, špatná domů.' Přisazovali po pětce a spadali tam vždycky. Jeden kominický mistr se dopálil, šel si domů pro peníze, když tam bylo už přes půldruhý stovky, a hopnul to. Vejvoda chtěl se toho zbavit, a jak potom povídal, chtěl táhnout třebas až do třiceti, jen aby to nevyhrál, a místo toho dostal dvě esa. Dělal, že nic nemá, a schválně povídá: ,Šestnáct brát.' A ten kominickej mistr měl všeho všudy patnáct. Není to smůla? Starej Vejvoda byl celej bledej a nešťastnej, kolem už nadávali a šuškali si, že dělá volty, že už jednou byl bit pro falešnou hru, ačkoliv byl to nejpoctivější hráč, a sypali tam korunku za korunkou. Už tam bylo pět set korun. Hostinský to nevydržel. Měl právě při­chystaný peníze do pivovaru, tak je vzal, přised si, strčil na­před do toho po dvou stovkách, pak zamhouřil oči, otočil židli pro štěstí a řek, že to všechno, co je v banku, hopá. ,Hrajeme,' povídá, ,s votevřenýma kartama.' Starej Vejvoda byl by já nevím co dal za to, aby teď prohrál. Všichni se divili, když otočil a ukázala se sedma, a on si ji nechal. Hostinský se smál pod fousy, poněvadž měl jednadvacet. Přišla druhá sedma starýmu Vejvodovi, a on si ji taky nechal. ,Teď přijde eso nebo desítka, ' řekl hostinský jizlivě, ,vsadím krk, pane Vejvo­do, že budete trop.' Bylo ohromný ticho, Vejvoda otočí, a vona se objeví třetí sedmička. Hostinskej zbledl jako křída, byly to jeho poslední peníze, vodešel do kuchyně a za chvilku přiběh­ne kluk, kterej se u něho učil, abychom šli pana hostinskýho uříznout, že prej visí na klice u okna. Tak jsme ho odřízli, vzkřísili a hrálo se dál. Už nikdo neměl žádný peníze, všechno to bylo v banku před Vejvodou, kterej jen říkal: ,Malá, špatná domů' a za živýho boha chtěl bejt trop, ale poněvadž musel votáčet svoje karty a vyložit na stůl, nemoh dělat žádnej pod­vod a schválně přetáhnout. Všichni byli už nad jeho štěstím blbí a udělali si to tak, že když už nemají peníze, že tam budou dávat svoje úpisy. Trvalo to kolik hodin a před starým Vejvodou rostly tisíce a tisíce. Kominickej mistr byl už do banku dlužen přes půldruhého miliónu, uhlíř ze Zderazu asi milión, domovník ze Stoletý kavárny 800 000 korun, jeden medik přes dva milióny. Jenom v pince bylo přes tři sta tisíc na samých útržkách papíru. Starej Vejvoda zkoušel to všeli­jak. Chodil pořád na záchod a vždycky to dal jinýmu, aby to vzal za něho, a když se vrátil, hlásili mu, že bral, že mu přišlo jednadvacet. Poslali pro nový karty, a zas to nebylo nic plat­ný. Když se Vejvoda zastavil na patnácti, tak měl ten druhej čtrnáct. Všichni se dívali vztekle na starýho Vejvodu a nejvíc láteřil jeden dlaždič, kerej do toho všeho všudy dal na hoto­vosti vosum korun. Ten votevřeně prohlásil, že takovej člo­věk, jako je Vejvoda, by neměl chodit po světě a měl by se zkopat, vyhodit a utopit jako štěně. To si nedovedete předsta­vit to zoufalství starýho Vejvody. Konečně přišel na nápad. ,Já jdu na záchod,' povídá kominíkovi, ,vezměte to za mne, pane mistře.' A jen tak bez klobouku výběh na ulici a přímo do Myslíkovy ulice pro strážníky. Našel patrolu a oznámil jí, že v tej a tej hospodě hrajou hazardní hru. Strážníci ho vy­zvali, aby šel napřed, že přijdou hned za ním. Vrátil se tedy a hlásili mu, že zatím medik prohrál přes dva milióny a do­movník přes tři. Do pinky že dali úpis na pět set tisíc korun. Za chvíli vrazili tam strážníci, dlaždič vykřik: ,Spas se, kdo můžeš,' ale nebylo to nic platný. Zabavili bank, vedli všechny na policii. Uhlíř ze Zderazu se zprotivil, tak ho přivezli v košatince. V banku bylo v dlužních úpisech přes půl miliardy a na hotových penězích patnáct set. ,Tohle jsem ještě nežral,' řekl policejní inspektor, když viděl takový závratný sumy, ,to­hle je horší než Monte Carlo.' Zůstali tam všichni až na starý­ho Vejvodu do rána. Vejvodu jako udavače pustili a slíbili, že dostane zákonnou jednu třetinu odměny ze zabaveného ban­ku, asi přes sto šedesát miliónů, von se ale do rána z toho zbláznil a ráno chodil po Praze vobjednávat si nedobytný po­kladny na tucty. Tomu se říká štěstí v kartách.”","""And was there a lot in the bank?"" Schweik asked calmly, “or did you rarely do forhont? When a card doesn't fall, it's very bad, but sometimes it's miserable when it's going too well. There was a tinsmith Vejvoda living on Zderaz, who always played a marriage in a pub behind the Centenary Café. One day, too, the devil whistled at him, he says, 'And why should we throw an one for a penny?' So they played a five-year-old and he held the pot. Everyone drowned and so it grew to ten. Old Vejvoda also wanted to wish something else, and he kept saying, 'Little, bad home.' You can't imagine how bad he was. Little bad no and no come, banks grow, and there were already a hundred. None of the players had enough to hop on, and Vejvoda was already sweaty. There was nothing to hear but his: 'Little, bad home.' They added five and always fell there. One chimney sweep caught fire, went home for money when there were over a hundred and a half, and hopped on it. The duke wanted to get rid of it, and as he said then, he wanted to pull up to thirty, just so he wouldn't win, and instead got two aces. He pretended to have nothing, and deliberately says, 'Take sixteen.' And that chimney sweep had fifteen in all. Isn't that unfortunate? Old Duke was all pale and unhappy, they were already cursing and whispering that he was making volts, that he had once been beaten for a fake game, even though he was the most honest player, and they poured crown after crown there. There were already five hundred crowns. Hostinsky couldn't stand it. He had money ready for the brewery, so he took it, sat down, pushed it in two hundred, then narrowed his eyes, turned his chair over for good luck, and said that everything in the bank was hopping. 'We're playing,' he says, 'with the cards open.' Old Duke wouldn't know what he gave him to lose now. Everyone was amazed when he turned and it turned out seven, and he kept it. Hostinsky laughed under his breath, for he was twenty-one. The second came to seven old Dukes, and he kept it. ""Now comes an ace or a dozen,"" the innkeeper said sarcastically, ""I'll bet your neck, Mr. Vejvoda, that you'll be a trope."" There was a great silence, the Duke turns, and the third seven appears. Hostinska paled like chalk, it was his last money, he went to the kitchen, and in a moment a boy who was learning to come up with us was going to cut off the innkeeper that he was hanging on the window handle. So we cut him off, resurrected him and continued to play. No one had any money anymore, it was all in the bank in front of the Duke, who just said, 'Little' bad home 'and wanted to be a tropic for a living god, but since he had to turn his cards over and put them on the table, he couldn't do any deception and deliberately drag . Everyone was already stupid at his happiness, and they did it so that when they no longer had the money, they would put their subscriptions there. It took several hours and thousands and thousands grew before the old Duke. The chimney sweep master already owed the bank over a million and a half, the coal miner from Zderaz about a million, the janitor from the Centennial Café 800,000 crowns, one medic over two million. There were over three hundred thousand in the paper alone on scraps of paper. Old Duke tried everything. He kept going to the bathroom and always gave it to someone to take it for him, and when he returned, they told him he was taking it, he had twenty-one. They sent for new cards, and again it was nothing valid. When Vejvoda stopped at fifteen, the other was fourteen. Everyone was looking angrily at the old Duke, and one tile was the hardest thing to do, the kerosene putting a lot of crowns into it. He openly stated that a person like Vejvoda should not walk the world and should be kicked, thrown out and drowned like a puppy. You can't imagine the old Duke's despair. He finally came up with the idea. 'I'm going to the bathroom,' he tells the chimney sweep, 'take it for me, master.' And just without a hat, a paddock on the street and directly into Myslíkova Street for police officers. He found a patrol and told her that they were gambling in this and that pub. The guards urged him to go ahead and come right after him. So he returned and was told that the medic had so far lost over two million and the janitor over three. That they put a subscription for five hundred thousand crowns. After a while, the guards stormed in, tiling, shouting, 'Save who you can,' but it was nothing valid. They confiscated the banks, led everyone to the police. The coal miner from Zderaz rebelled, so they brought him in a basket. There were over half a billion in debt securities in the bank and fifteen hundred in cash. 'I haven't eaten this yet,' said the police inspector, seeing such dizzying sums, 'this is worse than Monte Carlo.' They all stayed there except for old Duke until morning. The duke was released as informants and promised to receive a legal one-third of the reward from the confiscated bank, about over one hundred and sixty million, but he went crazy until the morning and went around Prague in the morning to order an uncollectible treasury for dozens. This is called luck in the cards. ”","“Was there a lot in the bank?” Švejk asked calmly. “Or was it that you were only seldom the forehand and given the first card of the game? When the cards are not falling your way, it can be very bad. But, sometimes, it’s just as lousy even when the game goes your way too well. “In Zderaz, there lived a plumber named Vejvoda. He always played mariáš in a pub behind the Centennial coffee house. Once, the card demon whistled in his ear too. ‘And how about playing a little 21? You know, some onezie, for just a nickel a hand.’ So, they played nickel onezie and he held the bank. They all kept getting busted. So, the ante grew to a tenner. Old Vejvoda wanted to let the others win a little, too. He kept saying: ‘Little one, bad one, going home.’ You cannot imagine the bad luck he had. The little bad one would not come. The bank grew to 100 crowns. None of the players had enough to hop it. So, Vejvoda began to sweat. All you could hear was this: ‘Little one, bad one, going home.’ “They kept upping the stakes by a tenner and the tenners always fell in the bank. A master chimney sweep got ticked off and went home to get more money. There was already 150 in there, and he had bet it all. Vejvoda just wanted to get rid of the bank. Later, as he told the story, he wanted to get his hand up to maybe 30, just so that he wouldn’t win. Instead, he got two aces. He acted as if he had nothing and purposefully said: ‘Sixteen takes.’ The master chimney sweep had only 15. Isn’t that rotten luck? “Old Vejvoda was all pale and unhappy. They were already bitching and whispering that he was cheating. Although he was the most honest player, they gossiped that he’d once been beaten up for stacking the deck. They poured one little crown in there after another. The bank was up to 500 crowns. “The pubkeeper couldn’t stand just watching any longer. He had put money aside to pay the brewery. So, he grabbed that cash, took a seat, threw in 200 crowns, squinted his eyes, turned the chair around for good luck and said: “‘I’m betting it all! I’m hopping the bank! And let’s play,’ he added sternly, ‘with all our cards face-up, on the table.’ “Old Vejvoda would have given anything, just then, to lose the bank. They all marveled when he turned a seven and kept it. The pubkeeper’s mouth smiled under his moustache, because he had twenty-one. Old Vejvoda was dealt a second seven, and he kept that one, too. “‘Now, you will get an ace or a ten,’ the pubkeeper said with malicious pleasure. ‘I’m betting my neck, Mister Vejvoda, that you go bust.’ There was an astounding silence. Vejvoda gingerly turned the next card over. And what comes up, but a third seven! “The pubkeeper turned pale as chalk. That was his last money. He went into the kitchen. After a little while, a boy, his apprentice, runs in yelling that we should go and cut the pubkeeper down. He had hung himself from the window handle. So we cut him down, revived him, and the game went on. “By now, nobody but Vejvoda had any money. Everything was in the bank in front of him and he kept saying: ‘Little one, bad one, going home.’ I swear to the Living God, all he wanted was to go bust. However, because he had to turn his cards over and lay them on the table, he couldn’t cheat and go over on purpose. More than 2,000 crowns were piled up in front of the old plumber. They were all completely dazed over his good luck. “Since they didn’t have anymore money, they just kept putting in their markers. This lasted for several hours. The master chimney sweep already owed the bank a million. A coalman from Zderaz owed almost another million. The custodian from the Centennial cafe owed 800,000 crowns, and a doctor over two million. The pinka, the players fee-cup, held another 300,000 in IOU’s, all on little scraps of paper. “Old Vejvoda tried to lose every which way he could. He kept going to the washroom and giving his hand to somebody else to stand in for him. When he came back, they would report to him that he had gotten another 21. They sent out for new cards, but it was in vain. When Vejvoda stopped at 15, the next closest player would have 14. “They all looked at old Vejvoda with outrage. The one bellyaching the most was a paver who had put in all of eight crowns in cash. He openly proclaimed that a man such as Vejvoda shouldn’t be walking the face of the Earth. He should be kicked into a squirming ball, he said, and drowned like a puppy. You cannot imagine old Vejvoda’s desperation. “Finally, he got an idea. ‘I’m going to the washroom,’ he said to the chimney sweep. ‘Take over for me.’ And just like that, without a hat, he ran out of the pub and right to Myslíkova Street to get the police. He found the patrol and informed them that there was a hazardous card game taking place in the pub. The cops asked him to go up ahead. They said that they would follow right away. “When Vejvoda returned, the other players explained to him that the doctor had lost over two million and the custodian more than three. They said the pinka now had markers for 500,000 crowns. “A little while later, the cops burst in. The paver yelled out ‘Save yourself, if you can!’ But, it was too late. They confiscated the bank and led everyone to the police station. The coalman from Zderaz resisted, so they locked him in the drunkards’ cart. There were IOU’s for 150 billion in the bank, but cash money of only 15 crowns. “‘I’ve never seen anything like it,’ the police inspector said when he saw such dizzying amounts. ‘This is worse than Monte Carlo.’ “They all had to stay in jail until morning, with the exception of old Vejvoda. They let him go. Since he was the informer, they promised he’d get the customary legal reward, one third of the confiscated bank. That would have been more than 160 million crowns. However, by morning, he had gone mad and was walking around Prague ordering burglar-proof safes by the dozen. That’s what you call bad luck at cards.”","""And was there a lot in the bank?"" asked Schweik with composure. Whereupon he plunged into a long rigmarole about a tinker named Vejvoda and his gambling misadventure with a chimney sweep, which had led to a raid by the police.

"Byli jste někdy v psinci a viděli jste tam takové uděšené zjevy psí? Ti všichni jsou ukradeni. Velkoměsto vychovalo zvláštní druh zlodějů, kteří živí se výhradně krádežemi psů. Jsou malé druhy salónních pejsků, trpasličí, ratlíčkové, zcela nepatrná rukavice, vejdou se do kapsy u svrchníku nebo do dámského rukávníku, kde se nosí s sebou. I odtud vám ho chudáka vytáhnou. Zlou německou dogu skvrnitou, která hlí­dá zuřivě na předměstí vilu, ukradnou v noci. Policejního psa ukradnou detektivovi před nosem. Vedete si psa na šňůře, přestřihnou ji a už jsou se psem pryč a vy se pitomě díváte na prázdnou šňůru.

The city has raised a special kind of thieves who make a living exclusively by stealing dogs. There are small types of salon dogs, dwarf, rat, very small gloves, they fit in a pocket by the coat or in a women's sleeve, where they are carried with them. Even from here, poor people will be pulled from you. The evil Great Dane, who guards the villa furiously in the suburbs, is stolen at night. The police dog is stolen from the detective's nose. You lead the dog on a leash, they cut it and they are gone with the dog and you are stupidly looking at the empty leash. Fifty percent of the dogs you meet on the street have changed their masters several times, and often years later you buy your own dog, which you stole as a puppy when you went for a walk with him.

That's why every dog looks around carefully.","Have you ever been in a kennel and seen these poor, frightened, canine apparitions? All of them have been stolen.

Pojede s ním zas do Sarajeva, a bude vdovou podruhé. To byl ve Zlivi u Hluboké před léty jeden hajný, měl takové ošklivé jméno Pinďour. Zastřelili ho pytláci a zůstala po něm vdova s dvěma dítkami a vzala si za rok opět hajného, Pepíka Šavlovic z Mydlovar. A zastřelili jí ho taky. Pak se vdala po­třetí a vzala si zas hajného a povídá: ,Do třetice všeho dobré­ho. Jestli teď se to nepodaří, tak už nevím, co udělám. To se ví, že jí ho zas zastřelili, a to už měla s těmi hajnými šest dětí dohromady. Byla až v kanceláři knížete pána na Hluboké a stěžovala si, že má s těmi hajnými trápení. Tak jí odporučili porybnýho Jareše z ražické bašty. A co byste řekli, utopili jí ho při lovení rybníka, a měla s ním dvě děti. Pak si vzala nunváře z Vodňan, a ten ji jednou v noci klepl sekyrou a šel se dobrovolně udat. Když ho potom u krajského soudu v Pís­ku věšeli, ukousl knězi nos a řekl, že vůbec ničeho nelituje, a také řekl ještě něco hodně ošklivého o císaři pánovi.”","""But I don't,"" said Schweik, ""God forbid that I want to compare someone to someone. The innkeeper knows me. See, I've never compared anyone to anyone? I just don't want to be in the archduke's widow's skin. What will he do now? The children are orphans, the estate in Konopiště without a master. And marry some new archduke again? What's in it for him? She will go to Sarajevo with him again and be a widow for the second time. There was a gamekeeper in Zliv u Hluboká years ago, he had such an ugly name, Pinďour. He was shot by poachers and was left with a widow with two children, who again married a gamekeeper, Pepík Šavlovice from Mydlovar. And they shot him, too. Then she married a third time and married a gamekeeper again and said: 'To the third of all good. If that doesn't work now, I don't know what to do. It is known that he was shot again, and she already had six children with the gamekeeper. She was only in the prince's lord's office in Hluboká and complained that she was in trouble with the gamekeepers. So they recommended the fishy Jareš from the Ražice bastion. And what would you say, they drowned her while hunting a pond, and she had two children with him. Then she took a nunvar from Vodňany, and one night he knocked her with an ax and went to marry voluntarily. When he was then hanged at the regional court in Písek, he bit the priest's nose and said that he did not regret anything at all, and he also said something very ugly about the emperor to the lord. ""","“But I don’t,” said Švejk defensively. “God spare me from wanting to compare anybody to somebody else. This pubkeeper knows me. Look, will you tell him that I have never compared anybody to somebody else? I just wouldn’t want to be in the skin of the widow left by the Archduke. What is she gonna do? The children are orphans. The Lord’s estate at Konopište is without a master. And to have to be married again to some new archduke? What’s in it for her? She’ll go with some new archduke to Sarajevo again, and, she’ll be widowed a second time. “Years ago, there was a gamekeeper in Zliv by Hluboká. He had the ugly name of Pindour (Littlepecker). Poachers shot him dead and he left a widow with two children. A year later she married a gamekeeper again. His name was Pepík Šavel and he was from Mydlovary. And, they shot him dead for her, too. She married for the third time. Again, she took a gamekeeper for a husband and said: ‘Three times lucky. But, if it doesn’t work out this time, I don’t know what I’ll do.’ You bet they did it to her again and shot him dead, as well. By now, she bore, altogether, six children with these gamekeepers. “She went all the way to the office of the Count of Hluboká to complain that she had suffered nothing but heartbreak with those gamekeepers. So, they recommended Jareš, who worked as a fishpond warden from a cottage at Ražice. And, what would you say if I told you they drowned him while they were fishing out the pond? She’d had two more children with him. Finally, she married a gelder from Vodnany who whacked her with an ax one night. He turned himself in voluntarily. While they were hanging him at the district courthouse in Písek, he bit off the priest’s nose and said he had no remorse for anything. He also said something very ugly about the Lord Emperor.”","But what I say is, I wouldn't like to be the Archduke's widow. What's she going to do now? Marry some other archduke? What good would come of that? She'd take another trip to Sarajevo with him and be left a widow for the second time. A good many years ago there was a gamekeeper at Zlim. He was called Pindour. A rum name, eh? Well, he was shot by poachers and left a widow with two children. A year later she married another gamekeeper from Mydlovary. And they shot him, too. Then she got married a third time and said : 'All good things go by threes. If this turns out badly, I don't know what I shall do.' Blessed if they didn't shoot him, too, and by that time she'd had six children with all those gamekeepers. So she went to the Lord of the Manor himself at Hluboka and complained of the trouble she'd had with the gamekeepers. Then she was advised to try Jares, a pond keeper. Well, you wouldn't believe it, but he got drowned while he was fishing and she'd had two children with him. Then she married a pig gelder from Vodnany and one night he hit her with an axe and gave himself up to the police. When they hanged him at the assizes in Pisek, he said he had no regrets and on top of that he passed some very nasty remarks about the Emperor."""

"„Je to víc než jistý,” zněla přímá odpověď, neboť Švejk neměl nikdy ve zvyku skrývat něco před druhým. „Tohle o vás se bude všem čtenářům novin náramně líbit. Já taky čtu rád tu rubriku o těch vopilejch a jejich výtržnostech. Nedáv­no u Kalicha nevyvedl jeden host nic jinýho, než že sám sobě rozbil sklenicí hlavu. Vyhodil ji do vejšky a postavil se pod ni. Odvezli ho, a ráno už jsme to četli. Nebo v Bendlovce jsem dal jednou jednomu funebrákovi facku a on mně ji vrátil. Aby­chom se smířili, museli nás oba zatknout, a hned to bylo v odpoledníčku. Nebo když v kavárně U mrtvoly rozbil ten pan rada dva tácky, myslíte, že ho šetřili? Byl taky na druhej den hned v novinách. Vy můžete jedině z vězení poslat do novin opravu, že zpráva, která byla o vás uveřejněná, se vás netýká a že s pánem toho jména nejste ani příbuznej, ani společnej, a domů psaní, aby vám tu vaši opravu vystřihli a schovali, abyste si to mohl přečíst, až si vodsedíte trest. — Není vám zima?” otázal se Švejk pln účasti, když zpozoroval, že inteligentní pán se klepe. „Máme letos nějak moc studenej konec léta.”","""It's more than certain,"" was the direct reply, as Schweik was never in the habit of hiding something from another. ""All newspaper readers will love this about you. I also like to read the section about the drunks and their riots. Recently, at Kalich, one guest did nothing but break his head with a glass. He threw her in college and stood under her. They took him away, and we read it in the morning. Or in Bendlovka, I slapped a funeral once and he returned it to me. We had to arrest us both to reconcile, and it was in the afternoon. Or when the council broke two coasters at the U mrtvoly café, do you think they saved him? He was also in the paper the next day. You can only send a correction to the newspaper from prison, that the report that was published about you did not concern you, and that you are neither related nor common to the master of that name, and home writing, to cut out your correction and hide it so that you can he could read it when you serve your sentence.

""We're kind of too cold this summer.""","“That’s more than a sure thing,” was Švejk’s straightforward answer. It had never been his habit to hide something from another. “This story about you will give the readers of the newspapers enormous pleasure. I, too, like to read about drunks and their breeches of the peace. Not long ago, at The Chalice, one customer did nothing wrong except to break his own head with a stein. He threw it up in the air and stood under it. They loaded him up and drove him away. And, first thing in the morning, we were already reading about it in the paper. One time in Bendlovka, I slapped an undertaker and he slapped me one back. In order for us to reconcile, they had to arrest both of us. And, right away, the story was in the small afternoon edition. “And, in that coffeehouse, At the Corpse, an office administrator broke two coasters. Do you think that they spared him? He was in the newspaper right away the next day. The only thing you can do from prison is send a correction to the newspaper, saying that the news item published about you has nothing to do with you. And, that you’re not related to the gentleman named in the paper, nor associated with him in any way. But, you can write home to have them cut out the news item about you and save it, so that you can read it when you have sat through your sentence. “Aren’t you cold?” asked Švejk sympathetically, noticing the intelligent gentleman was shivering. “We’re having a rather cold end of summer this year.”","""It's a dead certainty,"" was the downright answer, for it was not Schweik's way to hide anything from his fellow-men. ""This prank of yours is going to be a fair treat for newspaper readers. I myself like reading the drunk-and-disorderly bits. Not long ago at The Flagon there was a customer who smashed a glass with his head. He chucked it up into the air and then stood underneath it. They ran him in, and on the very next morning we read about it in the papers. Another time I gave an undertaker's mute a smack in the eye and he gave me one in return. To stop the row they had to run us both in, and the afternoon editions had all about it. Another time at The Dead Man there was a councillor who smashed two glasses. Do you think they hushed it up? Not they—the next day it was reported in all the papers. All you can do us to send from prison a letter to the newspapers saying that the report published about you doesn't refer to you and that you're no relation of the person of that name and have no connection with him. Then you must write home to tell them to cut your letter out of the paper and keep it, so that you can read it when they let you out of quod.""

"„Než jsem chtěl utéct a než mne potom sem dali mezi vás, byl jsem na čísle dvanáct. Tam jsou jako ti lehčí. Jednou vám tam přivedli jednoho člověka, odněkud z venkova. Dostal ten milý člověk čtrnáct dní, poněvadž u sebe nechával přespávat vojáky. Napřed se myslilo, že je to spiknutí, ale pak se vysvět­lilo, že to dělal za peníze. Měl být mezi těma nejlehčíma zavřenej, ale poněvadž tam bylo plno, tak se dostal mezi nás. A co si ale všechno s sebou nepřines z domova a co mu ještě neposlali, poněvadž měl nějak dovoleno, že může se stravovat sám a sobě přilepšit. I kouřit měl dovoleno. Měl dvě šunky, takový obrovský pecny chleba, vejce, máslo, cigarety, tabák, nu zkrátka na co si člověk pomyslí, to měl s sebou ve dvou baťochách. A chlap si myslel, že to musí sežrat sám. Začali jsme na něm loudit, když se nedovtípil, že se musí s námi dělit, jako se dělili ti druzí, když něco dostali, ale on chlap lakomá, že prý ne, že bude čtrnáct dní zavřenej a že by si zkazil žaludek tou kapustou a shnilýma bramborama, co nám dávají na mináž. Prej nám dá celou svou mináž i komisárek, vo to prý nestojí, ať prej si to dělíme mezi sebou anebo po poradě se střídáme. Řeknu vám, že to byl takovej fajnovej člověk, že si nechtěl ani na ten kyblík sedat a čekal až na druhej den na procházce, že to udělá na dvoře na latríně. Byl takovej rozmazlenej, že si dokonce přines s sebou klozetovej papír. Řekli jsme mu, že se mu vykašlem na tu jeho porci, a trpěli jsme den, druhej, třetí. Chlap žral šunku, mazal si máslo na chleba, loupal si vajíčka, zkrátka žil. Kouřil cigarety a ani šluka nechtěl nikomu dát. My prej nesmíme kouřit, a kdyby to viděl bachař, že nám dává šluka, že prej by ho zavřeli. Jak říkám, my jsme trpěli tři dny. Na čtvrtý den v noci jsme to udělali. Chlap se ráno probudí, a to jsem vám zapomněl říct, že se vždycky ráno, v poledne i večer, než se začal cpát, modlil, dlouho modlil. Tak se pomodlí a hledá svo­je baťochy pod pryčnou. Jó, baťochy tam byly, ale vysušený, scvrklý jako sušená švestka. Začal křičet, že je vokradenej, že mu tam nechali jen klozetovej papír. Pak zas myslel asi pět minut, že si děláme legraci, že jsme to někam poschovávali. Povídá ještě tak vesele: ,Já vím, vy jste šizuňkové, já vím, že mně to vrátíte, ale povedlo se vám to.' Byl tam mezi náma jeden Libeňák a ten povídá: ,Vědí co, přikryjou se dekou a po­čítají do deseti. A pak se podívají do těch svejch baťochů.' Přikryl se jako poslušnej chlapec a počítá: ,Jedna, dvě, tři...' A ten Libeňák povídá znova: ,To nesmějí tak rychle, to musejí hodně pomalu.' A tak von pod tou dekou počítá pomalu, v pře­stávkách: ,Jedna — dvě — tři...' Když přepočítal deset, vylez z kavalce a prohlíd si svoje baťochy. ,Ježíšmarjá, lidičky,' za­čal křičet, ,vždyť jsou prázdný, jako byly dřív!' A přitom ten jeho blbej obličej, mohli jsme všichni puknout od smíchu. Ale ten Libeňák povídá: ,Zkusejí to ještě jednou.' A věříte, že byl takovej blbej z toho ze všeho, že to ještě jednou zkusil, a když viděl, že zas tam nic nemá než ten klozetovej papír, začal mlátit do dveří a křičet: ,Vokradli mne, vokradli mne, pomóc, votevřte, prokristapána, votevřte.' Tak tam hned přilítli, zavo­lali štábního profousa a šikovatele Řepu. My všichni jeden jako druhý říkáme, že se zbláznil, že včera i dlouho do noci žral a že to všechno sežral. A von jen plakal a pořád říkal: ,Vždyť někde musejí bejt drobečky.' Tak hledali drobečky a nenašli, poněvadž tak chytrý jsme byli taky. Co jsme sami nemohli sežrat, poslali jsme poštou na šňůře do druhýho po­schodí. Nemohli nám nic dokázat, ačkoliv ten blbec pořád ved svou: ,Dyť ty drobečky někde musejí bejt.' Celej den vám nic nežral a dával pozor, jestli někdo něco nejí nebo nekouří. Druhej den se k obědu ještě také netknul mináže, ale večer mu šly ty shnilé brambory a kapusta k duhu, jenomže se už nemodlil jako dřív, než se dával do šunky a do vajíček. Potom tam jeden od nás dostal zvenčí ňákým způsobem dramky, a to začal s náma ponejprv mluvit, abychom prý mu dali šlu­ka. Nedali jsme mu nic.”","""Before I wanted to run away and then they put me here among you, I was at number twelve. There they are like the lighter ones. Once they brought you one person, from somewhere in the country. He got the nice man fourteen days because he let the soldiers sleep with him. At first it was thought it was a conspiracy, but then it was explained that he was doing it for money. He was supposed to be locked up among the lightest, but since it was full, he got among us. And what they didn't bring with them from home and what they hadn't sent him yet, because he was somehow allowed to eat and improve himself. He was also allowed to smoke. He had two hams, such huge loaves of bread, eggs, butter, cigarettes, tobacco, well, whatever one thinks, he had it with him in two packs. And the guy thought he had to eat it himself. We started loitering at him when he didn't realize he had to share with us like the others did when they got something, but the guy is greedy that he's not supposed to be closed for a fortnight and that he's going to ruin his stomach with cabbage and rotten potatoes, which they give us for minage. Prej. I'll tell you, he was such a nice man that he didn't even want to sit on the bucket and waited until the next day for a walk to do it in the latrine yard. He was so spoiled that he even brought toilet paper with him. We told him I would cough up his portion, and we suffered the second, third. The guy ate ham, rubbed butter on bread, peeled eggs, simply lived. He smoked cigarettes and didn't want to give anyone a shit. We must not smoke, and if the bachelor saw it, he would give us a snipe, that they would have locked him up. As I say, we suffered for three days. We did it on the fourth night. The guy wakes up in the morning, and I forgot to tell you that he always prayed, prayed, prayed for a long time in the morning, at noon and in the evening before he started stuffing. So he prays and searches for his backpacks. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either. He started shouting that he was stolen, that they had only left toilet paper there. Then he thought for about five minutes that we were joking, that we were hiding it somewhere. He says so cheerfully, 'I know, you're a bastard, I know you'll give it back to me, but you did it.' There was a Libeňák among us and he says: 'They know what, they cover themselves with a blanket and count to ten. And then they look at their backpacks. ' He hid like an obedient boy and counted, 'One, two, three ...' And the Libeňák says again: 'They can't do that so fast, they have to do it very slowly.' And so outside under that blanket he counts slowly, in breaks: 'One - two - three ...' When he counted ten, get out of the cot and look at your backpacks. ""Jesus Christ, people,"" he began to shout, ""they are as empty as they used to be!"" And yet his stupid face, we could all burst out laughing. But the Libeňák says: 'They will try again.' And you believe he was so stupid of all that he tried again, and when he saw that he had nothing there but the toilet paper, he started banging on the door and shouting, ""They stole me, stole me, help, open up, pro-Christ, open. ' So they immediately arrived, called the staff professor and beetroot. We all say that he went crazy, that he ate last night and late, and that he ate it all. And he just cried and kept saying, 'There must be crumbs somewhere.' So they looked for crumbs and didn't find them, because we were so smart too. What we could not eat ourselves, we sent by mail on a string to the second floor. They couldn't prove anything to us, even though the jerk kept saying, 'The crumbs have to be somewhere.' He didn't eat anything from you all day, watching if anyone ate or didn't smoke anything. The next day he didn't touch the mines for lunch either, but in the evening the rotten potatoes and cabbage went to the rainbow, but he no longer prayed as before he put on the ham and eggs. Then there one of us got dramas from outside, and he started talking to us first, so that we could give him a snipe. We didn't give him anything. ""","“I used to be in the number 12. There they put, like, the lighter cases. But that was before I wanted to escape and they put me in here with you. Let me tell you, once they brought this man in from somewhere in the country. This charming man got two weeks for letting some soldiers sleep over at his house. First, they thought it was part of some conspiracy, but then the explanation came down that he was just doing it for the money. He was supposed to be locked up with the lightest cases, but because it was all filled up there, they put him in with us. “You wouldn’t believe all the stuff he brought in with him and all that they sent him from home. Somehow, he was allowed to buy his own eats and keep lots of extras with him. He was even allowed to smoke! Whatever a man could want, he kept in two backpacks. He had two hams, giant loaves of bread, eggs, butter, cigarettes and other tobacco. “And this guy thought he must devour this stuff all by himself. We started begging him to share. But he didn’t get the hint that he should share with us, as the others always did when they got something extra. ‘No’ was all that stingy man could say. He said that the prison cabbage, broccoli and rotten potatoes would ruin his stomach if he had to eat them for the two weeks he was going to be locked up. “He said he would give us his whole mess portion and his commissary rations. He said he didn’t care about them and would let us divide it among ourselves, or take turns, or whatever. “And, let me tell you, he was such a refined man that he didn’t want to sit on the bucket. He waited until we had yard exercise the next day, so he could use the outhouse. He was so spoiled that he had even brought in toilet paper. “We told him we would piss on that mess portion of his. The man was gobbling down ham, spreading butter on his bread, peeling eggs for himself. In short, he was living it up. We suffered a day, then two, then three. He smoked his cigarettes and wouldn’t even give anyone a drag. We must not smoke, he said, because if the guard caught him giving us so much as a drag, they’d lock him in solitary. “As I said, we suffered for three days. On the night of the fourth day, we acted. When the man woke up in the morning..... Oh, I forgot to tell you: In the morning, and at noon, and in the evening, before he would start stuffing himself, he would always pray. He would pray for a long time. “So, that particular morning, after he had prayed, he starts looking for his backpacks under the plank bunk. Well, the backpacks were there, but they were shriveled up like dried prunes. “He started screaming that he had been robbed, that only the toilet paper was left for him. He thought it through again for about five minutes. He decided that we must be playing a hoax on him, that we just hid his stuff here and there. He tells himself sort of joyfully: ‘I know that you’re little cheats. I know that you’ll give it back to me. But, boys, you really got me good!’ “One of our guys was from the Liben neighborhood. He says: ‘You know what? Why don’t you just cover yourself with a blanket and count to 10? And then look into that backpack of yours.’ The stingy guy covered himself like an obedient boy and began counting: ‘One ...Two ...Three...’ The guy from Liben stops him: ‘You must not count so fast. You must go very slowly.’ “So, under the blanket, he counts slowly, with pauses: ‘One............ Two............. Three............’ When he finished counting to 10, he crawled out of the bunk and inspected his backpacks. ‘ Jesusmaria, people!” he started screaming. ‘They’re as empty as they were before.’ And, all the while, he has this stupid grimace on his face. We could have ripped ourselves open laughing. “But the guy from Liben says: ‘Try it one more time.’ And would you believe that he was so stupid from it all, that he tried it one more time? When he saw, again, that there was nothing in there, except his toilet paper, he started beating on the door and screaming: ‘They’ve robbed me! They’ve robbed me! Help! Open up! For christ-the-lord, open up!’ “The guards flew in there right away. Then they called the command warden and Master Sergeant Repa. To a man, we all said the guy had just gone nuts. We told them that, yesterday, he had been eating long into the night and must have devoured it all. “He started weeping and kept saying: ‘There have to be some little crumbs somewhere.’ So, they searched for crumbs. But, they didn’t find any. We were too smart for that. What we couldn’t down ourselves, we sent on a string up to the second floor. They couldn’t prove anything against us. Although that idiot kept whining: ‘But the crumbs must be somewhere.’ “He didn’t eat anything all that day. And, he was on the lookout to see whether anybody was eating something, or smoking. The next day, at lunchtime, he still didn’t touch the mess. But, by the evening meal, the rotten potatoes, broccoli and cabbage were going down good. Except, he wasn’t praying anymore, like he used to, before he would attack that ham and eggs. Then, somehow, one of us got some cheap smokes from the outside. That’s when he first started to talk to us, asking us to give him a drag. We gave him nothing.”","""On the left-hand side of the door leading into the office there's a spittoon and they throw fag-ends into it,"" one man informed Schweik. """

Přiznal se, a než došlo k pumpování žaludku, nebylo po mrtvici ani památky. Nejdéle se zde držel ten, co byl pokousán vzteklým psem. Kousal, vyl, to je pravda, to uměl znamenitě, ale nemoh nijak dostat dohromady tu pěnu u huby. Pomáhali jsme mu, jak jsme mohli. Lechtali jsme ho kolikrát po celou hodinu do vizity, až dostal křeče a zmodral nám, ale pěna u huby se nedostavovala a také nedostavila. Bylo to něco hrozného. Když se vzdával takhle ráno při vizitě, tak nám ho bylo líto. Postavil se u postele jako svíčka, zasalu­toval a řekl: ,Poslušně hlásím, pane obrarct, že asi ten pes, který mne kous, nebyl vzteklej.' Obrarct se na něho podíval tak nějak divně, že pokousaný se počal třást na celém těle a pokračoval: ,Poslušně hlásím, pane obrarct, že mne vůbec žádnej pes nekous, to jsem se já sám kous do ruky.'

He stood by the bed like a candle, saluted, and said, 'I obediently report, Mr. Obrarct, that the dog who bit me was probably not angry.'

Not even a remnant of the stroke remained. “The one who said he was bit by a rabid dog held out the longest. He was biting and howling. It’s true, he did know how to do that remarkably well.

We stopped when he got cramps and turned blue on us. But the foam wouldn’t come to his mouth. It just never did. It was something horrible. “One day during the doctor’s rounds, he gave himself up. We felt pity for him. He stood up by his bed, straight as a candle, saluted and said: ‘I dutifully report Chief Medical Officer, Sir, that perhaps the dog that bit me wasn’t rabid.’ The chief medical officer gave him such a weird look that his body started shaking all over and he blurted out: ‘I dutifully report, Chief Doctor, Sir, that no dog bit me at all. It was just I myself who bit my own hand.’ “After this confession, they investigated him for self-mutilation.

We helped him all we could. We used to keep on tickling him for a full hour before the doctor came till he got spasms and went blue in front of our very eyes, but there wasn't a trace of any foam. It just wasn't in him. Oh, it was something shocking. Well, when the doctor comes, up he stands by the bed straight as a dart and says : 'Beg to report, sir, that the dog that bit me don't seem to have been mad.' The doctor gives such a funny look at him that he begins to shake all over and goes on talking : 'Beg to report, sir, that I wasn't bitten by any dog at all. I bit my own hand, myself.'

"„To nevadí,” řekl Švejk, „první křesťani sloužili mši svatou i bez tabernákula. Kdybychom to někde voznámili, tak by chtěl ten poctivej nálezce na nás vodměnu. Kdyby to byly peníze, tak by se snad nenašel žádnej poctivej nálezce, ačko­liv jsou ještě takoví lidi. U nás v Budějovicích u regimentu byl jeden voják, takový dobrý hovado, ten našel jednou šest set korun na ulici a odevzdal je na policii a v novinách se o něm psalo jako o poctivým nálezci a měl z toho vostudu. Žádnej s ním nechtěl mluvit, každej mu říkal: ,Ty jeden pitomče, co jsi to vyved za hloupost. Vždyť tě to musí do smrti mrzet, jestli máš ještě trochu cti v těle.' Měl holku, a ta s ním přestala mluvit. Když přijel domů na dovolenou, tak ho o mu­zice kvůli tomu kamarádi vyhodili z hospody. Počal chřad­nout, brát si to do hlavy a nakonec se dal přeject vlakem. Jednou zas u nás v ulici našel jeden krejčí zlatý prsten. Lidi ho varovali, aby ho nevracel na policii, ale on si nedal říct. Přijali ho neobyčejně vlídně, že prý už je tam hlášena ztráta zlatého prstenu s briliantem, potom ale se podívají na kámen a říkají mu: ,Člověče, vždyť je to sklo, a ne briliant. Kolikpak vám za ten briliant dali? Takový poctivý nálezce my známe.' Nakonec se to vysvětlilo, že ještě jeden člověk ztratil zlatý prsten s falešným briliantem, nějakou rodinnou památku, ale krejčí seděl přece jen tři dny, poněvadž se z rozčilení dopustil urážky stráže. Dostal zákonitou odměnu deset procent, 1 K 20 hal., poněvadž ten šmejd měl cenu 12 korun, a on tu zákonitou odměnu hodil tomu pánovi do obličeje, a ten ho žaloval pro urážku na cti a krejčí dostal ještě deset korun pokuty. Potom všude říkal, že každej poctivej nálezce zaslouží pětadvacet, zřezat ho, až bude modrej, vysekat mu veřejně, aby si to lidi pamatovali a řídili se podle toho. Myslím, že naše tabernákulum nám nikdo nepřinese nazpátek, i když je vzadu značka regimentu, poněvadž s vojenskýma věcma nikdo nechce nic mít. Raději to zahodí někam do vody, aby s tím ještě neměl oplétání. Včera jsem mluvil v hospodě U zlatého věnce s jed­ním člověkem z venkova, je mu už šestapadesát let, a ten šel se optat na okresní hejtmanství do Nové Paky, proč mu rekvizírovali bryčku. Na zpáteční cestě, když ho z okresního hejtmanství vyhodili, díval se na trén, který právě přijel a stál na náměstí. Nějaký mladý muž poprosil ho, aby mu chvíli počkal u koní, že vezou pro vojsko konzervy, a víckrát už nepřišel. Když pak se hnuli, musel s nimi a dostal se až do Uher, kde někde poprosil taky někoho, aby mu počkal u vozu, a tím se jedině zachránil, a to by ho táhli do Srbska. Přijel celý vyjevený a víckrát nechce nic mít s vojenskejma věcma.”","""It doesn't matter,"" said Schweik. If we drove it somewhere, the honest finder would want us to pay. If it was money, there would probably be no honest finder, even though there are still such people. There was a soldier near the regiment in Budějovice, who found such a good beast, who once found six hundred crowns on the street and handed them over to the police, and the newspapers described him as an honest finder. No one wanted to talk to him, everyone said to him, 'You idiot, what a fool you did. It must make you sad to death if you still have some honor in your body. ' He had a girlfriend, and she stopped talking to him. When he came home on vacation, his friends threw him out of the pub because of the music. He began to wither, take it in his head, and finally set off by train. Once again, a tailor found a gold ring in our street. People warned him not to return him to the police, but he couldn't tell. They received him extraordinarily kindly, saying that the loss of the golden ring with the diamond was already reported there, but then they looked at the stone and said to him, ""Man, it's glass, not diamond. How much did they give you for that diamond? We know such an honest finder. ' In the end, it was explained that another man had lost a gold ring with a fake diamond, some family memory, but the tailor had only been sitting for three days because he had insulted the guard out of anger. He received a legal reward of ten percent, 1 K 20 hal., Because the blacksmith was worth 12 crowns, and he threw the legal reward in the master's face, and he sued him for defamation and the tailor received another ten crowns. Then he said everywhere that every honest finder deserved twenty-five, to cut him when he was blue, to cut him out publicly so that people would remember and follow it. I don't think anyone will bring our tabernacle back to us, even if there is a regiment mark on the back, because no one wants anything to do with military items. He'd rather throw it somewhere in the water so he doesn't get involved. Yesterday, I spoke to a man in the country at the Golden Wreath pub, who is already 56 years old, and he went to ask the district governor's office in Nová Paka why they had requisitioned his chariot. On the way back, when he was fired from the district governor's office, he looked at the train that had just arrived and stood in the square. A young man asked him to wait for a while at his horse to bring a can of troops, and he never came again. When they moved, he had to go with them and got to Hungary, where he also asked someone somewhere to wait at his car, and thus he only saved himself, and that would take him to Serbia. He has arrived all over the world and repeatedly wants nothing to do with military matters. ""","“It doesn’t matter,” said Švejk. “The first Christians used to serve the Holy Mass without a tabernacle. If we were to report it, an honest person finding it would want a reward from us. If we had lost money, then no honest person would come forward. Although there are still some people like that. “There was a soldier at the regiment in Budejovice. He was such a good-natured, dumb beast. He once found 600 crowns in the street and turned them in at the police station. They wrote him up as an honest person in the newspaper. It brought him such shame. Nobody wanted to talk to him. Everybody yelled at him: ‘You dumbbell, you! What sort of silliness did you do? Com’on! If you have a bit of honor left in your body, you will regret it until you die.’ “He had a girl. She stopped talking to him. When he came home on leave and went dancing, his friends threw him out of the pub on account of it. He started to mope about and take it too seriously. In the end, he let himself be run over by a train. “Another time, a tailor found a golden ring on our street. People warned him not to turn it in at the police station. But he wouldn’t let them talk him out of it. The police welcomed him in an unusually kind way. They said that there had already been a loss of a golden ring with a cut diamond reported. But when they looked at the stone, they said: ‘Man, this is glass, not a cut diamond. How much did they give you for the diamond? We know all about honest finders like you.’ “In the end, it was revealed that another man had lost a golden ring with a fake diamond, some family memento. But the tailor did time, nevertheless. He sat for three days because, he insulted a cop in the excitement. “Because that junk was worth only 12 crowns, he got the lawful reward of 10 percent: 1 crown and 20 halers. He threw the lawful reward into the rightful owner’s face and sued him for insulting his honor. For that, they added a 10-crown fine, to boot. After the incident, he would tell everyone that any honest person who turned in what he found deserved 25 lashes and to have his ass kicked until he turned blue. He added that such a person should be roughed up thoroughly in public. That way people would remember all this and act accordingly. “I don’t think that anybody will bring back our tabernacle, even though it has the mark of our regiment on the back. That’s because nobody wants anything to do with the military. They would rather throw it in the water somewhere, just to avoid any difficulties with the authorities “Yesterday, I spoke with a man from the country at the Golden Wreath pub. He is 56 years old. He went to the county administrator’s office in Nová Paka to ask why they had requisitioned his gig. On the way back, after they threw him out of the county chief’s office, he saw a supply convoy that had just arrived and stopped in the square. A young man asked him to watch his horses, because they were bringing food for the troops. The young man never showed up again. “When the convoy got moving again, the man left watching the horses was forced to go with them. He made it all the way to Hungary where he then asked somebody else to stand by the wagon. That was the only way he saved himself. They would have dragged him all the way to Serbia. He came back all dumbfounded and never again will have anything more to do with military matters.”","""That doesn't matter,"" said Schweik. "" The Early Christians polished off their mass without a tabernacle. If we was to advertise our loss, the honest person who found it would expect us to stump up. If it was money we'd lost, I don't suppose there'd be any honest person to find it, though there are people like that still knocking about. In the regiment I used to be in there was a soldier, a damn fool like that, who found 600 crowns in the street one day, and the newspapers called him an honest fellow, which properly blackened his character. Everybody kept out of his way and his girl gave him the chuck. When he went home on leave, his pals kicked him out of the bar parlour where they were having a jollification. He began to look very seedy, and in the end he threw himself under a railway train. Then there was a tailor down our street, and one day he found a gold ring. He was warned not to take it to the police, but he didn't take any notice. At the police station they were very nice to him, and said that somebody had already reported the loss of a gold ring with a brilliant, but when they had a look at the stone, they said : 'Why, my good fellow, that's glass ; that's not a brilliant. How much did you get for the brilliant? We've met honest fellows like you before.' Afterward it turned out that there was another man who'd lost a gold ring with a sham brilliant, a family heirloom, but the tailor spent three days in quod for getting excited and abusing the police. He got a reward of ten per cent., according to the regulations, and that came to one crown twenty hellers, because the sham jewellery was only worth twelve crowns, and he chucked this reward into some chap's face and this chap had him up for slander and the tailor had to pay an extra fine of ten crowns.
