"Het was niet goed van vader te oordelen zonder de strijdvraag te weten.

"We spraken over de meest verborgen dingen, maar over de dingen waarvan mijn hart vol was en is, hebben we tot nu toe gezwegen. Ik kan nog steeds niet goed uit Peter wijs, is hij oppervlakkig, of is het verlegenheid die hem zelfs tegenover mij tegenhoudt? Maar dat achterwege gelaten, ik heb één fout begaan door alle andere mogelijkheden om tot vriendschap te komen uit te schakelen en door te trachten met intimiteiten hem nader te komen. Hij hunkert naar liefde en hij begint me elke dag liever te vinden, dat merk ik heel goed. Hem geven onze ontmoetingen bevrediging, bij mij werken ze alleen maar de drang uit om het steeds weer opnieuw met hem te proberen. En toch kom ik er niet toe de onderwerpen aan te raken, die ik zo graag aan het licht zou laten komen. Ik heb Peter, meer dan hijzelf weet, met geweld naar mij toegehaald. Nu houdt hij zich aan me vast en ik zie voorlopig nog geen afdoend middel hem weer van me te scheiden en op eigen benen te zetten. Toen ik namelijk al heel gauw bemerkte, dat hij geen vriend voor mijn begrip kon zijn, heb ik er naar gestreefd hem dan tenminste op te heffen uit zijn bekrompenheid en hem groot te maken in zijn jeugd.","We talked about the most hidden things, but about the things my heart was and is full of, we have been silent until now. I still can't quite figure out Peter, is he superficial, or is it shyness holding him back even towards me? But that aside, I've made one mistake by eliminating all other possibilities for befriending and by trying to approach him with intimacies. He craves love and he starts to like me more every day, I can see that very well. Our encounters give him satisfaction, for me they only work out the urge to try again and again with him. And yet I do not get around to touching the subjects that I would so much like to bring to light. I have brought Peter to me by force, more than he knows himself. Now he clings to me and for the time being I see no effective means of separating him from me again and putting him on his own two feet. For when I soon realized that he could not be a friend to my understanding, I tried at least to lift him out of his narrowness and to make him great in his youth.","We talked about the most private things, but we haven’t yet touched upon the things closest to my heart. I still can’t make head or tail of Peter. Is he superficial, or is it shyness that holds him back, even with me? But putting all that aside, I made one mistake: I used intimacy to get closer to him, and in doing so, I ruled out other forms of friendship. He longs to be loved, and I can see he’s beginning to like me more with each passing day. Our time together leaves him feeling satisfied, but just makes me want to start all over again. I never broach the subjects I long to bring out into the open. I forced Peter, more than he realizes, to get close to me, and now he’s holding on for dear life. I honestly don’t see any effective way of shaking him off and getting him back on his own two feet. I soon realized he could never be a kindred spirit, but still tried to help him break out of his narrow world and expand his youthful horizons.","We talked about the most private things, and yet up till now we have never touched on those things that filled, and still fill, my heart and soul most deeply. I still don’t know quite what to make of Peter; is he superficial, or does he still feel shy, even of me? But dropping that, I committed one error in my desire to make a real friendship: I switched over and tried to get close to him by developing it into a more intimate relation, not leaving open all other possibilities. He longs to be loved and I can see that he’s beginning to be more and more in love with me. He gets satisfaction out of our meetings, whereas they just have the effect of making me want to start again. And I don’t seem able to touch on the subjects that I’m so longing to bring out into the daylight. I drew Peter towards me, far more than he realises. Now he clings to me for dear life, I don’t see any way of shaking him off and putting him on his own feet. I soon realised that he could not be a friend for my understanding, but thought I would at least try to lift him out of his narrow- mindedness and make something of his youth."

"Zondag, 12 Maart 1944","Sunday, March 12, 1944","WEDNESDAY, MARCH 8, 1944 Margot and I have been writing each other notes, just for fun, of course. Anne: It’s strange, but I can only remember the day after what has happened the night before. For example, I suddenly remembered that Mr. Dussel was snoring loudly last night. (It’s now quarter to three on Wednesday afternoon and Mr. Dussel is snoring again, which is why it flashed through my mind, of course.) When I had to use the potty, I deliberately made more noise to get the snoring to stop. Margot: Which is better, the snoring or the gasping for air? Anne: The snoring’s better, because it stops when I make noise, without waking the person in question. What I didn’t write to Margot, but what I’ll confess to you, dear Kitty, is that I’ve been dreaming of Peter a great deal. The night before last I dreamed I was skating right here in our living room with that little boy from the Apollo ice-skating rink; he was with his sister, the girl with the spindly legs who always wore the same blue dress. I introduced myself, overdoing it a bit, and asked him his name. It was Peter. In my dream I wondered just how many Peters I actually knew! Then I dreamed we were standing in Peter’s room, facing each other beside the stairs. I said something to him; he gave me a kiss, but replied that he didn’t love me all that much and that I shouldn’t flirt. In a desperate and pleading voice I said, “I’m not flirting, Peter!” When I woke up, I was glad Peter hasn’t said it after all. Last night I dreamed we were kissing each other, but Peter’s cheeks were very disappointing: they weren’t as soft as they looked. They were more like Father’s cheeks—the cheeks of a man who already shaves. FRIDAY, MARCH 10, 1944","Sunday, 12 March, 1944"

Ik dacht en dacht, dan had ik opeens een idee, ik pende mijn 3 opgegeven kantjes vol en was voldaan. Als argumenten had ik aangevoerd, dat praten vrouwelijk is, dat ik wel mijn best zou doen het een beetje te temperen, maar afleren zou ik het wel nooit, daar mijn moeder net zoveel praatte als ik, zo niet meer en dat aan overgeërfde eigenschappen nu eenmaal weinig te doen is.","In the evening, at home, when all my other homework was done, the note of the essay caught my eye.

I had argued that talking is feminine, that I would do my best to temper it a bit, but I would never unlearn it, as my mother talked as much as I did, if not more, and that to inherited qualities now once there is little to do.","That evening, after I’d finished the rest of my homework, the note about the essay caught my eye.

I argued that talking is a female trait and that I would do my best to keep it under control, but that I would never be able to break myself of the habit, since my mother talked as much as I did, if not more, and that there’s not much you can do about inherited traits.","That evening, when I’d finished my other homework, my eyes fell on the title in my notebook. I pondered, while chewing the end of my fountain pen, that anyone could scribble some nonsense in large letters with the words well spaced but the diﬃculty was to prove beyond doubt the necessity of talking. I thought and thought and then, suddenly having got an idea, filled my three allotted sides and felt completely satisfied. My arguments were that talking is a feminine characteristic and that I would do my best to keep it under control, but I should never be cured, for my mother talked as much as I, probably more, and what can one do about inherited qualities?"

Mother has expressed a wish, which isn’t likely to come true any time soon: not to have to see Mr. van Daan’s face for two whole weeks.","Mummy’s birthday is rapidly approaching. She got some extra sugar from Kugler, which made the van Daans jealous as Mrs. van Daan had not been favoured in this way for her birthday. But what’s the use of annoying each other with yet more unkind words, tears, and angry outbursts. You can be sure of one thing, Kitty, that we are even more fed up with them than ever! Mummy has expressed the wish—one which cannot come true just now—not to see the van Daans for a fortnight."
"Heb ik je verteld dat onze Moffi weg is? Sinds verleden week Donderdag spoorloos verdwenen. Ze zal zeker al lang in de kattenhemel zijn, terwijl de een of andere dierenvriend van haar een lekker boutje maakt. Misschien krijgt een meisje een muts van haar vel. Peter is over dit feit erg bedroefd.","Did I tell you our Moffi is gone? It has disappeared without a trace since last Thursday. She'll surely be in cat heaven for a long time, with some animal lover making her a tasty bolt. Maybe a girl gets a hat from her skin. Peter is very saddened by this fact.","Mr. Kleiman also brought some flea powder for the cats. Have I told you that our Boche has disappeared? We haven’t seen hide nor hair of her since last Thursday. She’s probably already in cat heaven, while some animal lover has turned her into a tasty dish. Perhaps some girl who can afford it will be wearing a cap made of Boche’s fur. Peter is heartbroken.","Have I told you that Boche has disappeared? Simply vanished—we haven’t seen a sign of her since Thursday of last week. I expect she’s already in cats’ heaven, while some animal lover is enjoying a succulent meal from her. Perhaps some little girl will be given a fur cap out of her skin. Peter is very sad about it."
"Dan denk ik niet aan al de ellende, maar aan het mooie dat nog overblijft. Hierin ligt voor een groot deel het verschil tussen moeder en mij. Haar raad voor zwaarmoedigheid is: ‘Denk aan al de ellende in de wereld en wees blij, dat jij die niet beleeft!’ Mijn raad is: ‘Ga naar buiten, naar de velden, de natuur en de zon, ga naar buiten en probeer het geluk in jezelf te hervinden en in God. Denk aan al het mooie dat er in en om jezelf nog overblijft en wees gelukkig!’","Then I don't think of all the misery, but of the beauty that remains. Herein lies a large part of the difference between mother and me. Her advice for melancholy is: ""Think of all the misery in the world and be glad that you do not experience it!"" My advice is: ""Go outside, to the fields, nature and the sun, go outside and try to rediscover happiness in yourself and in God. Think of all the beautiful things that remain in and around yourself and be happy!'","At such moments I don’t think about all the misery, but about the beauty that still remains. This is where Mother and I differ greatly. Her advice in the face of melancholy is: “Think about all the suffering in the world and be thankful you’re not part of it.” My advice is: “Go outside, to the country, enjoy the sun and all nature has to offer. Go outside and try to recapture the happiness within yourself; think of all the beauty in yourself and in everything around you and be happy.”","I don’t think then misery, but of all the beauty that still remains. This is one of the things in which Mummy and I are so entirely different. Her counsel when one feels melancholy is: “Think of all the misery in the world and be thankful that you are not sharing in it!” My advice is: “Go outside, to the fields, enjoy nature and the sunshine, go out and try to recapture happiness in yourself and in God. Think of all the beauty that’s still left in and around you and be happy!”"

Ik moet me diep schamen en ik schaam me diep.","I've had a lot of grief, but isn't everyone my age like that? I've played a lot of comedy, but I wasn't even aware of it, I felt lonely, but was hardly ever desperate!

"Ik zelf ben mijn scherpste en beste beoordelaar hier. Ik weet zelf wat goed en niet goed geschreven is.

"Tussen moeder en mevrouw Van Daan botert het niet zo erg; aanleidingen tot onaangenaamheden zijn er genoeg.

No Anne, you still have a lot to learn, start with that first, instead of looking down on others and accusing others!","What I’m most ashamed of is the way Father has forgiven me; he said he’s going to throw the letter in the stove, and he’s being so nice to me now, as if he were the one who’d done something wrong.

"Peter en ik worstelen alle twee met ons binnenste, we zijn alle twee nog onzeker en eigenlijk te teer en te zacht van innerlijk om hard aangepakt te worden. Doet men dat toch, dan is mijn reactie daarop de drang van ‘er uit te willen’. Maar omdat dat onmogelijk is, verberg ik mijn binnenste, gooi met pannen en water en ben luidruchtig, zodat iedereen maar wou, dat ik weg was.","Peter and I are both struggling with our insides, we are both still insecure and actually too delicate and soft inside to be dealt with harshly. If they do, then my reaction to that is the urge of 'wanting to get out'. But since that's impossible, I hide my insides, throw pans and water, and be loud, so everyone wishes I was gone.","Both Peter and I are struggling with our innermost feelings. We’re still unsure of ourselves and are too vulnerable, emotionally, to be dealt with so roughly. Whenever that happens, I want to run outside or hide my feelings. Instead, I bang the pots and pans, splash the water and am generally noisy, so that everyone wishes I were miles away.","Peter and I both wrestle with our inner feelings, we are still uncertain and are really too sensitive to be roughly treated. If we are, then my reaction is to 'get away from it all.’ But as that is impossible, I hide my feelings, throw my weight about the place, am noisy and boisterous, so that everyone wishes that I was out of the way."
"Ik heb met Pinksteren bijvoorbeeld, toen het zo warm was, 's avonds met geweld mijn ogen open gehouden, om bij half 12 de maan aan het open raam eens één keer goed en alleen te kunnen bekijken. Helaas liep deze opoffering op niets uit, daar de maan te veel licht verspreidde en ik een open raam niet mocht riskeren. Een andere keer, alweer heel wat maanden geleden, was ik toevallig boven, toen het raam 's avonds open was. Ik ging niet eerder naar beneden, voordat de luchttijd afgelopen was. De donkere regenachtige avond, de storm, de jagende wolken hielden me in hun macht gevangen; na anderhalf jaar had ik voor het eerst weer de nacht van aangezicht tot aangezicht gezien. Na die avond was mijn verlangen dit nog eens te zien groter dan mijn angst voor dieven, donker rattenhuis of overvallen. Ik ging geheel alleen naar beneden en keek naar buiten uit het raam van het privé-kantoor en de keuken. Vele mensen vinden de natuur mooi, velen slapen eens onder de blote hemel, velen verlangen in gevangenissen of ziekenhuizen naar de dag, dat ze weer vrij van de natuur kunnen genieten, maar weinigen zijn met hun verlangen zo afgesloten en geïsoleerd van datgene wat voor arm en rijk hetzelfde is.","At Pentecost, for example, when it was so hot, I violently kept my eyes open in the evenings, so that at half past eleven I could take a good look at the moon at the open window. Unfortunately, this sacrifice came to nothing, as the moon gave out too much light and I couldn't risk an open window. Another time, quite a few months ago, I happened to be upstairs when the window was open at night. I didn't go down until airtime was up. The dark rainy evening, the storm, the chasing clouds held me captive in their power; after a year and a half I had again seen the night face to face for the first time. After that night, my desire to see this again was greater than my fear of thieves, dark rat house, or robbery. I went down all alone and looked out the window of the private office and kitchen. Many people find nature beautiful, many sleep under the open sky, many long in prisons or hospitals for the day when they can enjoy nature freely again, but few are so closed off and isolated from what is poor with their longing. and rich is the same.","One night during the Pentecost holiday, for instance, when it was so hot, I struggled to keep my eyes open until eleven-thirty so I could get a good look at the moon, all on my own for once. Alas, my sacrifice was in vain, since there was too much glare and I couldn’t risk opening a window. Another time, several months ago, I happened to be upstairs one night when the window was open. I didn’t go back down until it had to be closed again. The dark, rainy evening, the wind, the racing clouds, had me spellbound; it was the first time in a year and a half that I’d seen the night face-to-face. After that evening my longing to see it again was even greater than my fear of burglars, a dark rat-infested house or police raids. I went downstairs all by myself and looked out the windows in the kitchen and private office. Many people think nature is beautiful, many people sleep from time to time under the starry sky, and many people in hospitals and prisons long for the day when they’ll be free to enjoy what nature has to offer. But few are as isolated and cut off as we are from the joys of nature, which can be shared by rich and poor alike.","Once at Whitsun, for example, when it was so warm, I stayed awake on purpose until half past eleven one evening in order to have a good look at the moon all by myself. Alas, the sacrifice was in vain, as the moon gave far too much light and I didn’t dare risk opening a window. Another time, some months ago now, I happened to be upstairs one evening when the window was open. I didn’t go downstairs until the window had to be shut. The dark, rainy evening, the gale, the scudding clouds held me entirely in their power, it was the first time in a year and a half that I’d seen the night face to face. After that evening my longing to see it again was greater than my fear of burglars, rats, and raids on the house. I was downstairs all by myself and looked outside through the windows into the kitchen and the private oﬃce. Lots of people are fond of nature, many sleep outdoors occasionally, and people in prisons and hospitals long for the day when they will be free to enjoy the beauties of nature, but few are so shut away and isolated as us from that which can be shared alike by rich and poor."

Ik vind het veel prettiger als hij mij wat uitlegt dan als ik hem wat moet leren: ik zou zo graag hebben dat hij in bijna alles een overwicht over mij had.,I find it much more pleasant when he explains something to me than when I have to teach him something: I would like him to have an upper hand over me in almost everything.,"It’s much nicer when he explains something to me than when I have to teach him. I wish he were superior to me in nearly every way! What do we care about our two mothers? Oh, if only he’d say something. Father always says I’m conceited, but I’m not, I’m merely vain! I haven’t had many people tell me I was pretty, except for a boy at school who said I looked so cute when I smiled. Yesterday Peter paid me a true compliment, and just for fun I’ll give you a rough idea of our conversation. Peter often says, “Smile!” I thought it was strange, so yesterday I asked him, “Why do you always want me to smile?” “Because you get dimples in your cheeks. How do you do that?” “I was born with them. There’s also one in my chin. It’s the only mark of beauty I possess.” “No, no, that’s not true!” “Yes it is. I know I’m not beautiful. I never have been and I never will be!” “I don’t agree. I think you’re pretty.” “I am not.”",I like it much better if he explains something to me than when I have to teach him; I would really adore him to be my superior in almost everything.

I think of going into hiding, my health and my whole being as das Gute; Peter’s love (which is still so new and fragile and which neither of us dares to say aloud), the future, happiness and love as das Liebe; the world, nature and the tremendous beauty of everything, all that splendor, as das Schöne.","And in the evening, when I lie in bed and end my prayers with the words, “I thank you, God, for all that is good and dear and beautiful,” I am filled with joy.

"Eén ding is hierbij goed, namelijk dat de sabotage tegen de overheid steeds erger wordt, naarmate het voedsel slechter wordt en de maatregelen tegen het volk strenger worden.

"Om half een kwam Peter de cadeautjes bekijken en bleef veel langer praten dan volstrekt nodig was, wat hij anders nooit gedaan zou hebben. 's Middags ging ik de koffie halen en haalde daarna de aardappels, omdat ik Margot één keer in het jaar verwennen wilde. Ik kwam door Peters kamer, hij haalde direct al zijn papieren van de trap af en ik vroeg of ik het luik naar de vliering moest sluiten. ‘Ja’, antwoordde hij, ‘doe dat maar.

I couldn’t refrain from sounding Peter out on the subject, and he instantly replied that Dussel had been lying. You should have seen Peter’s face. I wish I’d had a camera. Indignation, rage, indecision, agitation and much more crossed his face in rapid succession. That evening Mr. van Daan and Peter really told Dussel off.

"Hier is de opwinding weer wat bedaard, toch hopen wij dat de oorlog eind van het jaar eindelijk afgelopen zal zijn. Het zal tijd worden!

If only we could plunk her down in the loft in a bucket of cold water! Everyone in the Annex except Mr. van Daan and Peter has read the Hungarian Rhapsody trilogy, a biography of the composer, piano virtuoso and child prodigy Franz Liszt. It’s very interesting, though in my opinion there’s a bit too much emphasis on women ; Liszt was not only the greatest and most famous pianist of his time, he was also the biggest womanizer, even at the age of seventy. He had an affair with Countess Marie d’Agoult, Princess Carolyne Sayn-Wittgenstein, the dancer Lola Montez, the pianist Agnes Kingworth, the pianist Sophie Menter, the Circassian princess Olga Janina, Baroness Olga Meyendorff, actress Lilla what’s-her-name, etc. , etc., and there’s no end to it.

He helped others, put art above all else, was extremely fond of cognac and women, couldn’t bear the sight of tears, was a gentleman, couldn’t refuse anyone a favor, wasn’t interested in money and cared about religious freedom and the world.","The excitement here has worn off a bit; still, we’re hoping that the war will be over at the end of this year.

The people are fighting the Fascists in many places—even the army has joined the fight. How can a country like that continue to wage war against England? Our beautiful radio was taken away last week. Dussel was very angry at Mr. Kugler for turning it in on the appointed day. Dussel is slipping lower and lower in my estimation, and he’s already below zero. Whatever he says about politics, history, geography or anything else is so ridiculous that I hardly dare repeat it : Hitler will fade from history; the harbor in Rotterdam is bigger than the one in Hamburg; the English are idiots for not taking the opportunity to bomb Italy to smithereens; etc., etc. We just had a third air raid.

"Dussel is aangekomen. Het is hem allemaal meegelopen. Om elf uur, had Miep tegen hem gezegd, moest hij vóór het postkantoor op een bepaalde plaats zijn, daar zou een heer hem meenemen. Dussel stond op de afgesproken plaats precies op tijd, mijnheer Koophuis, dien Dussel eveneens kende, ging naar hem toe, berichtte dat de genoemde heer nog niet komen kon en of hij even op het kantoor bij Miep wilde komen. Koophuis stapte in de tram, reed terug naar kantoor en Dussel liep dezelfde weg op. Om tien minuten voor half 12 tikte Dussel aan de kantoordeur. Miep liet hem zijn jas uitdoen, zodat de ster onzichtbaar was en bracht hem naar het privé-kantoor, waar Koophuis hem bezig hield, tot de werkster weg was. Het voorwendsel gebruikend, dat het privé-kantoor niet langer vrij was, ging Miep vervolgens met Dussel naar boven, opende de draaikast en stapte voor de ogen van den stomverbaasden man naar binnen.","Dussel has arrived. It all went with him. At eleven o'clock, Miep had told him, he had to be at a certain place in front of the post office, a gentleman would take him there. Dussel was at the agreed place exactly on time, Mr. Koophuis, whom Dussel also knew, went to him, informed him that the said gentleman could not come yet and whether he would like to come to Miep's office. Koophuis got on the tram, drove back to the office and Dussel walked down the same road. At ten minutes to half past eleven, Dussel tapped at the office door. Miep made him take off his coat so that the star was invisible and took him to the private office, where Koophuis kept him busy until the maid had gone. Using the pretext that the private office was no longer available, Miep then went upstairs with Dussel, opened the revolving box and stepped in before the astonished man's eyes.","Mr. Dussel has arrived. Everything went smoothly. Miep told him to be at a certain place in front of the post office at 11 A.M., when a man would meet him, and he was at the appointed place at the appointed time. Mr. Kleiman went up to him, announced that the man he was expecting to meet was unable to come and asked him to drop by the office to see Miep. Mr. Kleiman took a streetcar back to the office while Mr. Dussel followed on foot. It was eleven-twenty when Mr. Dussel tapped on the office door. Miep asked him to remove his coat, so the yellow star couldn’t be seen, and brought him to the private office, where Mr. Kleiman kept him occupied until the cleaning lady had gone. On the pretext that the private office was needed for something else, Miep took Mr. Dussel upstairs, opened the bookcase and stepped inside, while Mr. Dussel looked on in amazement.","Mr. Dussel has arrived. All went well. Miep had told him that he must be at a special place in front of the Post Oﬃce at 11 o’clock, where a man would meet him. Mr. Dussel was standing at the rendezvous dead on time. Mr. Kleiman, who knows Mr. Dussel too; went up to him and told him that the said gentleman could not come, but asked whether he would just go to Miep at the oﬃce. Kleiman got into a tram and went back to the oﬃce; while Mr. Dussel walked in the same direction. At twenty past eleven Mr. Dussel tapped at the oﬃce door. Miep helped him off with his coat, so that the yellow star would not be seen, and took him to the private oﬃce, where Kleiman engaged him in conversation until the charwoman had gone. Then Miep went upstairs with Mr. Dussel under the pretext that the private oﬃce was needed for something, opened the swinging cupboard, and stepped inside before the eyes of the dumbfounded Mr. Dussel."
"Slecht is het zeker niet, integendeel!

"Vroeger thuis en op school werd er over geslachtsvraagstukken òf geheimzinnig òf weerzinwekkend gesproken.

"Dr Dussel: Neemt, kijkt niet, eet, praat niet. En als men praten moet, dan in 's hemelsnaam maar over eten; daar komt geen ruzie van, alleen opsnijderij. Enorme porties gaan er in en ‘neen’ wordt nooit gezegd, niet bij het goede en ook niet vaak bij het slechte. - De broek zit aan de borst, het rode jasje, zwarte pantoffels en een hoornen bril. Zo kan men hem zien aan het tafeltje, eeuwig werkende, alleen afgewisseld door het middagdutje, eten en ... het liefste plekje ... de W.C. Drie, vier, vijf keer per dag staat ongeduldig iemand voor de W.C.-deur en knijpt, hipt van het ene op het andere been en is haast niet te houden. Stoort hij er zich aan? Niks hoor, van kwart over zeven tot half acht, van half een tot één uur, van twee uur tot kwart over twee, van vier uur tot kwart over vier, van zes uur tot kwart over zes en van half twaalf tot twaalf uur. Men kan het noteren, dit zijn de vaste ‘zittingstijden’. Er wordt niet van afgeweken en hij stoort zich niet aan de smekende stem buiten de deur, die waarschuwt voor een snel naderend onheil.","Dr Dussel: Take, don't look, don't eat, don't talk. And if one has to talk, then for heaven's sake, talk about food; there will be no arguing, only squabbling. Enormous portions go in and 'no' is never said, not with the good and not often with the bad. - The pants are on the chest, the red jacket, black slippers and horn-rimmed glasses. So one can see him at the table, perpetually working, only interspersed with the afternoon nap, food and ... the sweetest spot ... the W.C. Three, four, five times a day someone stands impatiently in front of the toilet door and pinches, hops from one leg to the other and is almost unstoppable. Does he mind? Nothing, from a quarter past seven to seven thirty, from half past one to one o'clock, from two o'clock to a quarter past two, from four o'clock to a quarter past four, from six o'clock to a quarter past six and from half past eleven to twelve o'clock. It can be noted, these are the fixed 'session times'. There is no deviating from it and he is not bothered by the pleading voice outside the door, which warns of a fast approaching doom.","Dussel. Help yourself, keep your eyes on the food, eat and don’t talk. And if you have to say something, then for goodness’ sake talk about food. That doesn’t lead to quarrels, just to bragging. He consumes enormous portions, and “no” is not part of his vocabulary, whether the food is good or bad. Pants that come up to his chest, a red jacket, black patent-leather slippers and horn-rimmed glasses— that’s how he looks when he’s at work at the little table, always studying and never progressing. This is interrupted only by his afternoon nap, food and—his favorite spot—the bathroom. Three, four or five times a day there’s bound to be someone waiting outside the bathroom door, hopping impatiently from one foot to another, trying to hold it in and barely managing. Does Dussel care? Not a whit. From seven-fifteen to seven-thirty, from twelve-thirty to one, from two to two-fifteen, from four to four-fifteen, from six to six-fifteen, from eleven-thirty to twelve. You can set your watch by them; these are the times for his “regular sessions.” He never deviates or lets himself be swayed by the voices outside the door, begging him to open up before a disaster occurs.","Dr. Dussel.

"Mijnheer Kepler moest erg om mijn argumenten lachen, maar toen ik mijn praat-uurtje in de volgende les toch weer voortzette, volgde ook het tweede opstel. Ditmaal moest het een ‘onverbeterlijke kletskous’ zijn. Ook dit werd ingeleverd en Kepler had twee lessen lang niet te klagen. In de derde les werd het hem echter weer te bont. ‘Anne, als strafwerk voor praten, een opstel over het onderwerp ‘Kwek, kwek, kwek, zei juffrouw Snaterbek’. De klas schaterde. Ik moest wel meelachen, hoewel mijn vindingrijkheid op het gebied van kwebbelopstellen uitgeput was. Ik moest er iets anders, heel origineels op vinden. Het toeval kwam me te hulp, mijn vriendin Sanne, goede dichteres, bood haar hulp aan om het opstel van begin tot eind op rijm in te leveren. Ik juichte. Kepler wou me met dit onzinnige onderwerp in de maling nemen, ik zou hem met mijn gedicht driedubbel in de maling nemen.","Mr. Kepler had to laugh a lot at my arguments, but when I continued my talking hour in the next lesson, the second essay also followed. This time it had to be an 'incorrigible chatterbox'. This too was handed in and Kepler had no complaints for two lessons. In the third lesson, however, it became too much for him again. ""Anne, as a punishment for talking, an essay on the subject 'Kwek, quack, quack, said Miss Snaterbek'. The class laughed. I couldn't help but laugh, though my chatter ingenuity was exhausted. I had to find something else, very original about it. Chance came to my rescue, my friend Sanne, a good poet, offered her help to hand in the essay in rhyme from start to finish. I cheered. Kepler wanted to fool me with this nonsensical subject, I would fool him threefold with my poem.","Mr. Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments, but when I proceeded to talk my way through the next class, he assigned me a second essay. This time it was supposed to be on “An Incorrigible Chatterbox.” I handed it in, and Mr. Keesing had nothing to complain about for two whole classes. However, during the third class he’d finally had enough. “Anne Frank, as punishment for talking in class, write an essay entitled ‘“Quack, Quack, Quack,” Said Mistress Chatterback.’” The class roared. I had to laugh too, though I’d nearly exhausted my ingenuity on the topic of chatterboxes. It was time to come up with something else, something original. My friend Sanne, who’s good at poetry, offered to help me write the essay from beginning to end in verse. I jumped for joy. Keesing was trying to play a joke on me with this ridiculous subject, but I’d make sure the joke was on him.","Mr. Keesing had to laugh at my arguments, but when I continued to hold forth in the next lesson, another composition followed. This time it was 'Incurable Chatterbox’ I handed this in and Keesing made no complaints for two whole lessons. But in the third lesson it was too much for him again. “Anne, as punishment for talking, will do a composition entitled 'Quack, quack, quack, said Mrs. Chatterback.’” Shouts of laughter from the class. I had to laugh too, although I felt that my inventiveness on this subject was exhausted. I had to think of something else, something entirely original. I was in luck, as my friend Sanne writes good poetry and offered to help by doing the whole composition in verse. I jumped for joy. Keesing wanted to make a fool of me with this absurd theme, I would get back at him and make him the laughing- stock of the whole class."
"Veel nieuws is er niet te berichten. Bij uitzondering is de verstandhouding hier goed, niemand heeft ruzie, we hebben zo'n huisvrede zeker een half jaar niet gehad. Elli is nog steeds van ons gescheiden.","There is not much news to report.

Elli is still separated from us.","(the only word that will do here), we’re all getting on well together. No squabbles, though that probably won’t last long.

We are all getting on well together for a change! There’s no quarrelling—we haven’t had such peace in the home for at least half a year. Bep is still parted from us.
"Gevolg was, dat we helemaal niet stil waren, totdat ik buiten op het overloopje (tegenover onze kastdeur) hamerslagen hoorde. Ik dacht dadelijk aan den timmerman en waarschuwde Elli, die boven aan het eten was, dat ze niet naar beneden kon. Vader en ik vatten post aan de deur om te horen, wanneer de man zou vertrekken. Na een kwartier aan het werk geweest te zijn, legde hij daarbuiten zijn hamer en andere gereedschappen op onze kast (zo meenden we) en klopte aan onze deur. We werden wit, zou hij dus toch iets gehoord hebben en nu dit geheimzinnige gevaarte willen onderzoeken? Het scheen zo, het kloppen, trekken, duwen en rukken hield aan. Ik viel haast flauw van angst bij de gedachte dat het dien wildvreemden man mocht gelukken onze mooie schuilplaats te ontmantelen. En net dacht ik, dat ik de langste tijd geleefd had, toen ik mijnheer Koophuis hoorde zeggen: ‘Doe even open, ik ben het’. Dadelijk openden we. De haak, waarmee de deurkast vastzit en die door ingewijden ook van buiten verwijderd kan worden, was gaan klemmen; daardoor had niemand ons voor den timmerman kunnen waarschuwen. De man was nu naar beneden gegaan en Koophuis wilde Elli halen, doch kreeg de kast weer niet open.","The result was that we were not quiet at all, until I heard hammer blows outside on the landing (opposite our closet door). I immediately thought of the carpenter and warned Elli, who was eating upstairs, that she could not go downstairs. Father and I went to the door to hear when the man would leave. After working for fifteen minutes, he put his hammer and other tools out there on our cupboard (or so we thought) and knocked on our door. We became white, so could he have heard something and now want to investigate this mysterious monster? It seemed so, the knocking, pulling, pushing and jerking continued. I almost fainted with terror at the thought that this complete stranger might succeed in dismantling our beautiful hideout. And just now I thought I had lived the longest time when I heard Mr Koophuis say: 'Open the door, it's me'. We opened immediately. The hook, which fastens the door cupboard and which can also be removed from the outside by insiders, had started to get stuck; therefore no one could have warned us about the carpenter. The man had now gone downstairs and Koophuis wanted to fetch Elli, but could not open the cupboard again.","As a result, we didn’t bother to be quiet until I heard the sound of hammering on the landing (across from the bookcase). I immediately assumed it was the carpenter and went to warn Bep, who was eating lunch, that she couldn’t go back downstairs. Father and I stationed ourselves at the door so we could hear when the man had left. After working for about fifteen minutes, he laid his hammer and some other tools on our bookcase (or so we thought!) and banged on our door. We turned white with fear. Had he heard something after all and now wanted to check out this mysterious-looking bookcase? It seemed so, since he kept knocking, pulling, pushing and jerking on it. I was so scared I nearly fainted at the thought of this total stranger managing to discover our wonderful hiding place. Just when I thought my days were numbered, we heard Mr. Kleiman’s voice saying, “Open up, it’s me.” We opened the door at once. What had happened? The hook fastening the bookcase had gotten stuck, which is why no one had been able to warn us about the carpenter. After the man had left, Mr. Kleiman came to get Bep, but couldn’t open the bookcase.","The result was that we weren’t making any attempt to keep quiet, until I heard hammering outside on the landing opposite our cupboard door. I thought of the carpenter at once and warned Elli, who was having a meal with us, that she shouldn’t go downstairs. Daddy and I posted ourselves at the door so as to hear when the man left. After he’d been working for a quarter of an hour, he laid his hammer and tools down on top of our cupboard (as we thought) and knocked at our door. We turned absolutely white. Perhaps he had heard something after all and wanted to investigate our secret den. It seemed like it. The knocking, pulling, pushing, and wrenching went on. I nearly fainted at the thought that this utter stranger might discover our beautiful secret hiding place. And just as I thought my last hour was at hand, I heard Kleiman say, “Open the door, it’s only me.” We opened it immediately. The hook that holds the cupboard, which can be undone by people who know the secret, had got jammed. That was why no one had been able to warn us about the carpenter. The man had now gone downstairs and Kleiman wanted to fetch Elli, but couldn’t open the cupboard again."

Arme jongen, hij heeft nog nooit het gevoel van anderen gelukkig maken gekend en dat kan ik hem ook niet leren.

"Peter zoekt naar alle kanten, ha, daar ziet-ie de kat, weer kruipt hij het kantoor binnen en trekt het dier aan de staart. Mouschi blaast, Peter zucht. Wat heeft hij bereikt?

Mouschi’s now sitting by the window licking herself, very pleased at having escaped Peter’s clutches. Peter has no choice but to lure her with a piece of bread. Mouschi takes the bait, follows him out, and the door closes. I watch the entire scene through a crack in the door. Mr. van Daan is angry and slams the door. Margot and I exchange looks and think the same thing: he must have worked himself into a rage again because of some blunder on Mr. Kugler’s part, and he’s forgotten all about the Keg Company next door. Another step is heard in the hallway. Dussel comes in, goes toward the window with an air of propriety, sniffs … coughs, sneezes and clears his throat. He’s out of luck—it was pepper. He continues on to the front office. The curtains are open, which means he can’t get at his writing paper. He disappears with a scowl. Margot and I exchange another glance. “One less page for his sweetheart tomorrow,” I hear her say.","Peter looks all around—Aha! he sees him there, he crawls into the oﬃce again and pulls the animal by its tail.

Hij sprak over zijn leven thuis, over het zwart-handelen en dat hij zo'n nietsnut was. Ik zei, dat hij wel een heel sterk minderwaardigheidsgevoel had. Hij sprak ook over de Joden. Hij zou het veel gemakkelijker gevonden hebben, als hij Christen was en als hij na de oorlog Christen zou kunnen zijn. Ik vroeg, of hij zich wou laten dopen, maar dat was ook niet het geval.

I asked if he wanted to be baptized, but he didn't. After the war, no one would know whether he was a Christian or a Jew, he said.","After I’d explained some French to him, we began to talk.

He said life would have been much easier if he’d been a Christian or could become one after the war. I asked if he wanted to be baptized, but that wasn’t what he meant either. He said he’d never be able to feel like a Christian, but that after the war he’d make sure nobody would know he was Jewish.","We soon began talking.

"Dussel plofte op een stoel neer en keek ons allemaal een poosje sprakeloos aan, alsof hij eerst even goed de waarheid van onze gezichten wilde lezen. Daarna stotterde hij: ‘Maar ... aber, sind u dan niet in België?

Mr. Dussel was speechless in the face of such ingenuity, and could do nothing but gaze around in surprise as he explored the rest of our lovely and ultrapractical Annex.","Mr. Dussel sank into a chair, speechless, and looked at us all for a while, as if he had to really take it all in first.

"Lieve Kitty,","Dear kitty,","Dearest Kitty, Yesterday was Dussel’s birthday. At first he acted as if he didn’t want to celebrate it, but when Miep arrived with a large shopping bag overflowing with gifts, he was as excited as a little kid. His darling “Lotje” has sent him eggs, butter, cookies, lemonade, bread, cognac, spice cake, flowers, oranges, chocolate, books and writing paper. He piled his presents on a table and displayed them for no fewer than three days, the silly old goat! You mustn’t get the idea that he’s starving. We found bread, cheese, jam and eggs in his cupboard. It’s absolutely disgraceful that Dussel, whom we’ve treated with such kindness and whom we took in to save from destruction, should stuff himself behind our backs and not give us anything. After all, we’ve shared all we had with him! But what’s worse, in our opinion, is that he’s so stingy with respect to Mr. Kleiman, Mr. Voskuijl and Bep. He doesn’t give them a thing. In Dussel’s view the oranges that Kleiman so badly needs for his sick stomach will benefit his own stomach even more. Tonight the guns have been banging away so much that I’ve already had to gather up my belongings four times. Today I packed a suitcase with the stuff I’d need in case we had to flee, but as Mother correctly noted, “Where would you go?” All of Holland is being punished for the workers’ strikes. Martial law has been declared, and everyone is going to get one less butter coupon. What naughty children.","Dear Kitty,"

"Alsof nu de Duitse Weermachtberichten en de Engelse B.B.C. nog niet genoeg waren, is er sinds een tijdje een ‘Luftlagemeldung’ ingeschakeld. Magnifiek in één woord, maar aan de andere kant ook vaak teleurstellend. De Engelsen maken van hun luchtwapen een continubedrijf - alleen te vergelijken met de Duitse leugens, die dito dito zijn -. Dus, de radio staat al vroeg 's ochtends aan en wordt elk uur gehoord, tot 's avonds negen, tien of vaak ook elf uur.","As if the German Wehrmacht messages and the British B.B.C. weren't enough, a 'Luftlagemeldung' has been called in for a while. Magnificent in one word, but often disappointing on the other. The English make a continuous operation of their air gun - only to be compared with the German lies, which are ditto ditto -. So, the radio is on early in the morning and is heard every hour, until nine, ten or often eleven o'clock in the evening.","As if the German “Wehrmacht News” and the English BBC weren’t enough, they’ve now added special air-raid announcements. In a word, splendid. But the other side of the coin is that the British Air Force is operating around the clock. Not unlike the German propaganda machine, which is cranking out lies twenty-four hours a day! So the radio is switched on every morning at eight (if not earlier) and is listened to every hour until nine, ten or even eleven at night.","Just as if the 'German Wehrmacht’ News bulletins and the English B.B.C. were not enough, they have now introduced 'Special Air-Raid Announcements.’ In one word, magnificent; but on the other hand often disappointing too. The British are making a non-stop business of their air attacks, with the same zest as the Germans make a business of lying. The radio, therefore, goes on early in the morning and is listened to at all hours of the day, until nine, ten, and often 11 o’clock in the evening."

"Moffi is nog een onbekende voor je, toch is ze al in de zaak geweest, voordat we gingen onderduiken. Ze is de magazijn- en kantoorkat en houdt in de opslagplaats de ratten verre. Ook haar politieke naam is makkelijk uit te leggen. Een tijdlang had de firma twee katten, één voor het magazijn en één voor de zolder. Het gebeurde wel eens, dat die twee elkaar ontmoetten, wat altijd grote gevechten ten gevolge had. De magazijner was altijd degene die aanviel, terwijl het zolderbeest op het eind toch de overwinning behaalde. Net als in de politiek. Dus werd de magazijnkat, de Duitse of Moffi, en de zolderkat, de Engelse of Tommi, genoemd. Tommi is later afgeschaft en Moffi dient ons allen tot amusement, als we naar beneden gaan.","Moffi is still a stranger to you, yet she has already been in the case before we went into hiding. She is the warehouse and office cat and keeps the rats away in the warehouse. Her political name is also easy to explain. For a while, the firm had two cats, one for the warehouse and one for the attic. It sometimes happened that the two met, which always resulted in great fights. The warehouseman was always the one who attacked, while the attic beast was victorious in the end. Just like in politics. So it was called the warehouse cat, the German or Moffi, and the attic cat, the English or Tommi. Tommi is later abolished and Moffi is entertaining us all as we go down.","You haven’t met Boche yet, despite the fact that she was here before we went into hiding. She’s the warehouse and office cat, who keeps the rats at bay in the storeroom. Her odd, political name can easily be explained. For a while the firm Gies & Co. had two cats: one for the warehouse and one for the attic. Their paths crossed from time to time, which invariably resulted in a fight. The warehouse cat was always the aggressor, while the attic cat was ultimately the victor, just as in politics. So the warehouse cat was named the German, or “Boche,” and the attic cat the Englishman, or “Tommy.” Sometime after that they got rid of Tommy, but Boche is always there to amuse us when we go downstairs.","You haven’t met Boche yet, although she was here before we went into hiding.

The aggressor was always the warehouse cat, yet it was always the attic cat who managed to win—just like among nations. So the storehouse cat was named the German or 'Boche’ and the attic cat the English or 'Tommy.’ Tommy was got rid of later, we are all entertained by Boche when we go downstairs."

"Moeder is verschrikkelijk zenuwachtig en dat is voor mij altijd erg gevaarlijk. Zou het toeval zijn dat vader en moeder nooit Margot een standje geven en dat alles altijd op mij neerkomt? Gisteravond bijvoorbeeld: Margot las een boek, waarin prachtige tekeningen stonden; zij stond op, ging naar boven en legde het boek opzij om het straks verder te lezen. Ik had net niets te doen, pakte het en bekeek de platen. Margot kwam terug, zag ‘haar’ boek in mijn hand, trok een rimpel in haar voorhoofd en vroeg het boek terug. Ik wilde nog eventjes verder kijken, Margot werd steeds kwader, moeder mengde zich er in met de woorden: ‘Dat boek leest Margot, geef het dus aan haar’. Vader kwam de kamer binnen, wist niet eens waar het over ging, zag dat Margot iets misdaan werd en viel tegen mij uit: ‘Ik zou jou eens willen zien als Margot in jouw boek zou bladeren!’","Mother is terribly nervous and that is always very dangerous for me. Could it be a coincidence that Mother and Father never scold Margot and that everything always comes down to me? For example, last night: Margot read a book with beautiful drawings; she got up, went upstairs, and set the book aside to continue reading later. I just had nothing to do, picked it up and looked at the records. Margot came back, saw 'her' book in my hand, wrinkled her forehead and asked for the book back. I wanted to look a little further, Margot became more and more angry, Mother mixed in with the words: 'Margot reads that book, so give it to her'. Father came into the room, didn't even know what it was about, saw that Margot was doing something wrong, and snapped at me, ""I'd like to see you if Margot flipped through your book!""","Bep stayed with us Friday evening. It was fun, but she didn’t sleep very well because she’d drunk some wine. For the rest, there’s nothing special to report. I had an awful headache yesterday and went to bed early. Margot’s being exasperating again.","Mummy is frightfully irritable and that always seems to herald unpleasantness for me. Is it just chance that Daddy and Mummy never rebuke Margot and that they always take out everything on me? Yesterday evening, for instance: Margot was reading a book with lovely drawings in it; she got up and went upstairs, put the book down, ready to go on with it later. I wasn’t doing anything, so picked up the book and started looking at the pictures. Margot came back, saw 'her’ book in my hands, wrinkled her forehead and asked for the book back. Just because I wanted to look a little further on, Margot got more and more angry. Then Mummy joined in, “Give the book to Margot, she was reading it,” she said. Daddy came into the room. He didn’t even know what it was all about, but saw the injured look on Margot’s face and promptly dropped on me, “I’d like to see what you’d say if Margot ever started looking at one of your books!”"
"Pim stelt zich altijd op het standpunt van den ouderen vader, die ook wel eens zulke voorbijgaande neigingen gehad heeft, maar die met mij toch niet meer als vriend kan meeleven, hoe ijverig hij daar ook naar zoekt.","Pim always takes the standpoint of the elderly father, who has sometimes had such transient tendencies, but who can no longer sympathize with me as a friend, no matter how diligently he searches for it.","Pim always acts like the elderly father who once had the same fleeting impulses, but who can no longer relate to me as a friend, no matter how hard he tries.","Pim always takes up the older, fatherly attitude, telling me that he too has had similar passing tendencies. He’s not able to connect with me like a friend, however hard he tries."
"Moeder denkt dat Peter verliefd op mij is, eerlijk gezegd wou ik maar dat het waar was, dan zijn we quitte en kunnen elkaar veel makkelijker bereiken. Ze zegt verder, dat hij mij zoveel aankijkt. Nu is het wel waar, dat we elkaar meer dan eens in de kamer beknipogen en dat hij naar mijn wangenkuiltjes kijkt, daar kan ik toch niets aan doen! Is het wel?","Mother thinks Peter is in love with me, honestly I wish it were true, then we'll be even and it's much easier to reach each other. She goes on to say that he looks at me so much. Now it is true that we wink at each other more than once in the room and that he looks at my dimples, I can't help that! Is it?","Furthermore, Mother thinks Peter’s in love with me. To tell you the truth, I wish he were. Then we’d be even, and it’d be a lot easier to get to know each other. She also claims he’s always looking at me. Well, I suppose we do give each other the occasional wink. But I can’t help it if he keeps admiring my dimples, can I?","Mummy thinks that Peter is in love with me; quite frankly, I only wish he were, then we’d be quits and really be able to get to know each other. She also says that he keeps on looking at me. Now, I suppose that’s true, but still I can’t help it if he looks at my dimples and we wink at each other occasionally, can I?"
"Veel verandering komt er in ons leven hier niet. Mijnheer Van Daan en ik liggen altijd overhoop, daarentegen houdt hij veel van Margot. Mama doet soms alsof ik een baby ben en dat kan ik niet uitstaan. Verder gaat het wel wat beter. Peter vind ik nog steeds niet aardiger, het is een vervelende jongen, hij luiert de hele dag op zijn bed, timmert een beetje en gaat dan weer dutten. Wat een stomkop!","There will not be much change in our lives here. Mr Van Daan and I are always at odds, on the other hand he loves Margot very much. Mommy sometimes acts like I'm a baby and I can't stand that. Other than that, things are going a bit better. I still don't like Peter, he's an annoying boy, he lazes all day on his bed, does a little hammering and then goes back to nap. What a dumb ass!","There’s little change in our lives here. Peter’s hair was washed today, but that’s nothing special. Mr. van Daan and I are always at loggerheads with each other. Mama always treats me like a baby, which I can’t stand. For the rest, things are going better. I don’t think Peter’s gotten any nicer. He’s an obnoxious boy who lies around on his bed all day, only rousing himself to do a little carpentry work before returning to his nap. What a dope! Mama gave me another one of her dreadful sermons this morning.","There is little change in our life here. Mr. van Daan and I usually manage to upset each other, it’s just the opposite with Margot whom he likes very much. Mummy sometimes treats me just like a baby, which I can’t bear. Otherwise things are going better. I still don’t like Peter any more, he is so-boring; he uops lazily on his bed half the time, does a bit of carpentry, and then goes back for another snooze. What a fool!"
"Eenmaal bij het grote bed aangeland, is de ergste schrik al heen, behalve als het schieten erg hard mocht zijn.","Once arrived at the big bed, the worst fear is already gone, unless the shooting should be very hard.","Once I’ve reached the big bed, the worst is over, except when the shooting is extra loud.","Once I’ve landed in the big bed, the worst is over, except if the firing gets very bad."

"Miep en Kraler ondervinden het meest de last van ons achten, Miep in haar werk, Kraler, die de kolossale verantwoording soms te machtig wordt en die bijna niet meer spreken kan van ingehouden zenuwen en opwinding. Koophuis en Elli zorgen ook goed voor ons, zeer goed zelfs, maar eenmaal is voor hen ook het Achterhuis vergeten, al is het dan maar voor een paar uurtjes, een dag, twee dagen misschien. Ze hebben hun eigen zorgen, Koophuis voor zijn gezondheid, Elli om haar verloving die er niet erg rooskleurig uitziet en naast die zorgen hebben ze ook hun uitstapjes, hun visites, hun hele leven van gewone mensen. Voor hen wijkt de spanning soms, al is het maar voor een korte tijd, voor ons wijkt ze nooit. Twee jaar lang duurt het nu al en hoe lang nog zullen wij aan deze haast ondraaglijke, steeds groeiende druk weerstand moeten blijven bieden?","Miep and Kraler suffer the most from our esteem, Miep in her work, Kraler, who sometimes becomes too powerful for the colossal responsibility and who can hardly speak of suppressed nerves and excitement. Koophuis and Elli also take good care of us, very well in fact, but once they also forget the Secret Annex, even if only for a few hours, a day, maybe two days. They have their own worries, Koophuis for his health, Elli for her engagement that doesn't look very rosy and besides those worries they also have their trips, their visits, their whole lives of ordinary people. For them the tension sometimes subsides, if only for a short time, for us it never subsides. It has been two years now and how much longer will we have to resist this almost unbearable, ever-increasing pressure?","Miep and Mr. Kugler bear the greatest burden for us, and for all those in hiding—Miep in everything she does and Mr. Kugler through his enormous responsibility for the eight of us, which is sometimes so overwhelming that he can hardly speak from the pent-up tension and strain. Mr. Kleiman and Bep also take very good care of us, but they’re able to put the Annex out of their minds, even if it’s only for a few hours or a few days. They have their own worries, Mr. Kleiman with his health and Bep with her engagement, which isn’t looking very promising at the moment. But they also have their outings, their visits with friends, their everyday lives as ordinary people, so that the tension is sometimes relieved, if only for a short while, while ours never is, never has been, not once in the two years we’ve been here. How much longer will this increasingly oppressive, unbearable weight press down on us?","Miep and Kugler carry the heaviest burden of the eight in hiding, Miep in all she does, and Kugler through his enormous sense of responsibility for all of us, which is sometimes so much for him that he can hardly talk from pent-up nerves and strain. Kleiman and Bep look after us well too, but they can forget us at times, even if it’s only for a few hours, or a day, or even two days. They have their own worries, Kleiman over his health, Bep over her engagement, which is not altogether rosy, and they also have their little outings, visits to friends, and the whole life of ordinary people. For them the burden is sometimes lifted, even if it is only for a short time, but for us it never lifts for a moment.

Ondanks alles was ik de hele dag een beetje uit mijn gewone doen, toen ik over ons gesprek nadacht, leek het me toch eigenaardig.

"Maar omdat we alle zeven ook zo erg verschillend zijn en het vraagstuk van de genanterie bij een paar hoger zit dan bij de rest, heeft elk lid van de familie zich een aparte badplaats uitgezocht. Peter baadt in de keuken, hoewel de keuken een glazen deur heeft. Als hij van plan is een bad te nemen, bezoekt hij ons allemaal apart en deelt mede dat we gedurende een half uur niet langs de keuken mogen lopen. Deze maatregel vindt hij dan voldoende. Mijnheer baadt helemaal boven, bij hem weegt de veiligheid van eigen kamer op tegen de lastigheid van het hete water al de trappen op te dragen. Mevrouw gaat voorlopig helemaal niet in het bad; die wacht af, welke plaats de beste is. Vader baadt in het privé-kantoor, moeder in de keuken achter een kachelscherm; Margot en ik hebben het voorkantoor als ploeterplaats gekozen. 's Zaterdagmiddags gaan daar de gordijnen dicht, dan reinigen we ons in het donker, terwijl diegene die niet aan de beurt is, door een kier van het gordijn uit het raam kijkt, en zich over de grappige mensen verbaast.","But because all seven of us are so very different and the question of genanterie is higher with a few than with the rest, each member of the family has chosen a separate bathing place. Peter bathes in the kitchen, although the kitchen has a glass door. When he plans to take a bath, he visits each of us separately and informs us that we are not allowed to walk past the kitchen for half an hour. He finds this measure sufficient. Mister bathes at the very top, with him the safety of his own room outweighs the difficulty of carrying the hot water up all the stairs. Madame is not taking a bath at all for the time being; it waits to see which place is the best. Father bathes in the private office, mother in the kitchen behind a stove screen; Margot and I chose the front office as a slog. On Saturday afternoons, the curtains close there, then we clean ourselves in the dark, while the person whose turn it is, looks out of the window through a crack in the curtain, and marvels at the funny people.","But since none of us are alike and are all plagued by varying degrees of modesty, each member of the family has selected a different place to wash. Peter takes a bath in the office kitchen, even though it has a glass door. When it’s time for his bath, he goes around to each of us in turn and announces that we shouldn’t walk past the kitchen for the next half hour. He considers this measure to be sufficient. Mr. van D. takes his bath upstairs, figuring that the safety of his own room outweighs the difficulty of having to carry the hot water up all those stairs. Mrs. van D. has yet to take a bath; she’s waiting to see which is the best place. Father bathes in the private office and Mother in the kitchen behind a fire screen, while Margot and I have declared the front office to be our bathing grounds. Since the curtains are drawn on Saturday afternoon, we scrub ourselves in the dark, while the one who isn’t in the bath looks out the window through a chink in the curtains and gazes in wonder at the endlessly amusing people.","But because we are all so different and some are more modest than others, each member of the family has found his own place for carrying out the performance. Peter uses the kitchen in spite of its glass door. When he is going to have a bath, he goes to each one of us in turn and tells us that we must not walk past the kitchen for half an hour. He seems to think this is suﬃcient. Mr. van Daan goes right upstairs; to him it is worth the bother of carrying hot water all that way, so as to have the seclusion of his own room. Mrs. van Daan simply doesn’t bathe at all at present; she is waiting to see which is the best place. Daddy has his bath in the private oﬃce, Mummy behind a fire guard in the kitchen; Margot and I have chosen the front oﬃce for our scrub. The curtains there are drawn on Saturday afternoons, so we wash ourselves in semi-darkness."
"Je moet in geen geval denken, dat ik verliefd op Peter ben, geen sprake van. Als de Van Daans in plaats van een zoon hier een dochter hadden gehad, zou ik ook geprobeerd hebben met haar vriendschap te sluiten.","Under no circumstances should you think that I am in love with Peter, no way.

I’ll try to be strong again, and if I’m patient, the rest will follow. But—and this is the worst part—I seem to be chasing him.

No running water, no flushing toilet, no walking around, no noise whatsoever. As long as the office staff hasn’t arrived, sounds travel more easily to the warehouse.","As the clock strikes half past eight in the morning, Margot and Mummy are jittery: “Ssh... Daddy, quiet, Otto, ssh. Pim.” “It is half past eight, come back here , you can’t run any more water, walk quietly!” These are the various cries to Daddy in the bathroom. As the clock strikes half past eight, he has to be in the living room. Not a drop of water, no lavatory, no walking about, everything quiet. As long as none of the oﬃce staff are there, everything can be heard in the warehouse."

Moeder heeft op het ogenblik Heeren, vrouwen en knechten, dat mag ik niet hebben (Margot wel), ik moet eerst wat meer ontwikkeld zijn, zoals mijn begaafde zuster. Dan spraken we over mijn onwetendheid omtrent philosophie, psychologie en physiologie, waar ik niets van af weet. Misschien ben ik het volgend jaar wijzer!

Then we discussed my ignorance of philosophy, psychology and physiology (I immediately looked up these big words in the dictionary!). It’s true , I don’t know anything about these subjects. But maybe I’ll be smarter next year! I’ve come to the shocking conclusion that I have only one long-sleeved dress and three cardigans to wear in the winter.","Also the fact that I’m hardly allowed to read any decent books was mentioned.

Het duurde niet erg lang, toen werd het me te machtig, mijn hoofd viel voorover op mijn arm en ik snikte het uit. De tranen stroomden en ik voelde me diep ongelukkig. O, was ‘hij’ maar gekomen om me te troosten. Het was al vier uur toen ik weer naar boven ging. Ik haalde aardappels met weer nieuwe hoop in mijn hart op een ontmoeting, maar toen ik nog in de badkamer mijn haar aan het opdoffen was, ging hij naar Moffi in het magazijn.","The morning was calm.

It didn't take very long, then it became too much for me, my head fell forward on my arm and I sobbed. The tears flowed and I felt deeply unhappy. Oh, if only ""he"" had come to comfort me.

"Gisteren zijn Peter en ik dan eindelijk aan ons gesprek toegekomen, dat minstens al tien dagen uitgesteld was. Ik heb hem alles van de meisjes uitgelegd en niet geschroomd de meest intieme dingen te bespreken. De avond eindigde met een wederzijdse zoen, zo'n beetje naast mijn mond, het is werkelijk een fijn gevoel.","Yesterday, Peter and I finally got around to our conversation, which had been postponed for at least ten days. I explained everything about the girls to him and didn't hesitate to discuss the most intimate things. The evening ended with a mutual kiss, pretty much next to my mouth, it's a really nice feeling.","Yesterday Peter and I finally got around to having the talk we’ve been postponing for the last ten days. I told him all about girls, without hesitating to discuss the most intimate matters. I found it rather amusing that he thought the opening in a woman’s body was simply left out of illustrations. He couldn’t imagine that it was actually located between a woman’s legs. The evening ended with a mutual kiss, near the mouth. It’s really a lovely feeling!","Yesterday Peter and I finally got down to our talk, which had already been put off for at least ten days.

"Zondagmiddag had ik mijn verjaardag-partijtje. We hebben een film gehad, De Vuurtorenwachter met Rin-tin-tin, die zeer in de smaak viel bij mijn klasgenootjes. We hadden veel pret en het was heel gezellig. Er waren veel jongens en meisjes. Moeder wil nog altijd weten met wien ik later zou willen trouwen. Ze kan nooit vermoeden, dat het Peter Wessel is, omdat ik het haar destijds zo zonder blikken af blozen uit het hoofd gepraat heb. Met Lies Goosens en Sanne Houtman ben ik al jaren bevriend, het waren mijn beste vriendinnen. Intussen heb ik Jopie de Waal op het Joodse Lyceum leren kennen. Wij zijn veel samen en zij is nu mijn beste vriendin. Lies is nu meer met een ander meisje samen en Sanne is op een andere school en heeft daar vriendinnen.","Sunday afternoon I had my birthday party. We had a movie, The Lighthouse Keeper with Rin-tin-tin, which was very popular with my classmates. We had a lot of fun and it was very cosy. There were many boys and girls. Mother still wants to know who I would like to marry when I grow up. She can never suspect that it is Peter Wessel, because at the time I talked her out of it without batting an eyelid. I have been friends with Lies Goosens and Sanne Houtman for years, they were my best friends. In the meantime I got to know Jopie de Waal at the Jewish Lyceum. We spend a lot of time together and she is now my best friend. Lies is now more with another girl and Sanne is at a different school and has friends there.","Ru Stoppelmon is a short, goofy boy from Almelo who transferred to this school in the middle of the year. C.N. does whatever he’s not supposed to. Jacques Kocernoot sits behind us, next to C., and we (G. and I) laugh ourselves silly. Harry Schaap is the most decent boy in our class. He’s nice. Werner Joseph is nice too, but all the changes taking place lately have made him too quiet, so he seems boring. Sam Salomon is one of those tough guys from across the tracks. A real brat. (Admirer!) Appie Riem is pretty Orthodox, but a brat too.","I had my birthday party on Sunday afternoon, We showed a film The Lighthouse Keeper with that adorable dog Rin-Tin- Tin, which my school friends thoroughly enjoyed. We had a lovely time. There were lots of girls and boys. Mummy always wants to know whom I’m going to marry.

We are together a lot and she is now my best girl friend. Hanneli is more friendly with another girl, and Sanne goes to a different school, where she has made new friends."
"Ik word onevenwichtig behandeld. De ene dag is Anne zo verstandig en mag alles weten en de volgende dag hoor ik weer, dat Anne nog maar een klein dom schaap is dat van niets afweet en denkt wonder wat uit boeken geleerd te hebben. Ik ben niet meer de baby en het troetelkind, dat bovendien bij al haar daden uitgelachen mag worden. Ik heb mijn eigen idealen, ideeën en plannen, maar kan ze nog niet onder woorden brengen. Ach, er komt zoveel rijzen als ik 's avonds alleen ben, eveneens overdag als ik de mensen moet verdragen die me de keel uithangen of die mijn bedoelingen altijd verkeerd opvatten. Ik kom daarom tenslotte altijd weer tot mijn dagboek terug, dat is mijn begin- en mijn eindpunt, want Kitty is altijd geduldig, ik zal haar beloven, dat ik ondanks alles vol zal houden, mijn eigen weg zal banen en mijn tranen slikken. Ik zou alleen zo graag alvast de resultaten zien, of één keer aangemoedigd worden, door iemand die me liefheeft.","I am treated unbalanced. One day Anne is so sensible and allowed to know everything, and the next day I hear again that Anne is just a stupid little sheep that knows nothing and thinks wonderfully that she has learned something from books. I am no longer the baby and the pet, who, moreover, may be laughed at for all her actions. I have my own ideals, ideas and plans, but I can't put them into words yet. Ah, so much arises when I am alone at night, and also during the day when I have to endure the people who hang my throats or who always misunderstand my intentions. That's why I always come back to my diary in the end, that's my starting point and my ending point, because Kitty is always patient, I will promise her that I will persevere in spite of everything, make my own way and swallow my tears. I would only love to see the results beforehand, or be encouraged once, by someone who loves me.","For the rest, nothing special to report. This week I’ve been reading a lot and doing little work. That’s the way things ought to be. That’s surely the road to success. Mother and I are getting along better lately, but we’re never close. Father’s not very open about his feelings, but he’s the same sweetheart he’s always been. We lit the stove a few days ago and the entire room is still filled with smoke. I prefer central heating, and I’m probably not the only one. Margot’s a stinker (there’s","My treatment varies so much.

Oh, so many things bubble up inside me as I lie in bed, having to put up with people I’m fed up with, who always misinterpret my intentions. That’s why in the end I always come back to my diary. That is where I start and finish, because Kitty is always patient. I’ll promise her that I shall persevere, in spite of everything, and find my own way through it all, and swallow my tears.

"Toen Sinterklaas naderde, dachten we allemaal onwillekeurig aan de leuk opgemaakte mand van verleden jaar en vooral mij leek het vervelend om dit jaar alles over te slaan. Ik dacht lang na, totdat ik iets gevonden had, iets grappigs.","As Sinterklaas approached, we all involuntarily thought of last year's nicely decorated basket and it seemed especially annoying to me to skip everything this year. I thought for a long time until I found something, something funny.","The closer it got to St. Nicholas Day, the more we all thought back to last year’s festively decorated basket. More than anyone, I thought it would be terrible to skip a celebration this year.

"A.: ‘Geen kwestie van, de Engelse radio heeft altijd de waarheid gezegd. En stel, dat de berichten overdreven zijn, dan zijn de feiten nog erg genoeg, want u kunt niet ontkennen, dat het een feit is, dat er in Polen en Rusland vele millioenen vreedzame mensen zonder veel omwegen vermoord of vergast worden’.","A.: No matter, English radio has always told the truth. And suppose that the reports are exaggerated, then the facts are still bad enough, because you cannot deny that it is a fact that in Poland and Russia many millions of peaceful people are murdered or gassed without much detour.","Annex: “Absolutely not. The BBC has always told the truth. And even if the news is slightly exaggerated, the facts are bad enough as they are. You can’t deny that millions of peace-loving citizens in Poland and Russia have been murdered or gassed.” I’ll spare you the rest of our conversations. I’m very calm and take no notice of all the fuss. I’ve reached the point where I hardly care whether I live or die. The world will keep on turning without me, and I can’t do anything to change events anyway. I’ll just let matters take their course and concentrate on studying and hope that everything will be all right in the end. Yours, Anne TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 194414 Dear Kitty, I can’t tell you how I feel. One minute I’m longing for peace and quiet, and the next for a little fun. We’ve forgotten how to laugh—I mean, laughing so hard you can’t stop. This morning I had “the giggles”; you know, the kind we used to have at school. Margot and I were giggling like real teenagers. Last night there was another scene with Mother. Margot was tucking her wool blanket around her when suddenly she leapt out of bed and carefully examined the blanket. What do you think she found? A pin! Mother had patched the blanket and forgotten to take it out. Father shook his head meaningfully and made a comment about how careless Mother is. Soon afterward Mother came in from the bathroom, and just to tease her I said, “Du bist doch eine echte Rabenmutter.”15 Of course, she asked me why I’d said that, and we told her about the pin she’d overlooked. She immediately assumed her haughtiest expression and said, “You’re a fine one to talk. When you’re sewing, the entire floor is covered with pins. And look, you’ve left the manicure set lying around again. You never put that away either!” I said I hadn’t used it, and Margot backed me up, since she was the guilty party. Mother went on talking about how messy I was until I got fed up and said, rather curtly, “I wasn’t even the one who said you were careless. I’m always getting blamed for other people’s mistakes!” Mother fell silent, and less than a minute later I was obliged to kiss her good-night. This incident may not have been very important, but these days everything gets on my nerves. As I seem to be going through a period of reflection at the moment and letting my mind range over anything and everything, my thoughts have naturally turned to Father and Mother’s marriage. It has always been presented to me as an ideal marriage. Never a quarrel, no angry faces, perfect harmony, etc., etc. I know a few things about Father’s past, and what I don’t know, I’ve made up; I have the impression that Father married Mother because he felt she would be a suitable wife. I have to admit I admire Mother for the way she assumed the role of his wife and has never, as far as I know, complained or been jealous. It can’t be easy for a loving wife to know she’ll never be first in her husband’s affections, and Mother did know that. Father certainly admired Mother’s attitude and thought she had an excellent character. Why marry anyone else? His ideals had been shattered and his youth was over. What kind of marriage has it turned out to be? No quarrels or differences of opinion—but hardly an ideal marriage. Father respects Mother and loves her, but not with the kind of love I envision for a marriage. Father accepts Mother as she is, is often annoyed, but says as little as possible, because he knows the sacrifices Mother has had to make. Father doesn’t always ask her opinion—about the business, about other matters, about people, about all kinds of things. He doesn’t tell her everything, because he knows she’s far too emotional, far too critical, and often far too biased. Father’s not in love. He kisses her the way he kisses us. He never holds her up as an example, because he can’t. He looks at her teasingly, or mockingly, but never lovingly. It may be that Mother’s great sacrifice has made her harsh and disagreeable toward those around her, but it’s guaranteed to take her even farther from the path of love, to arouse even less admiration, and one day Father is bound to realize that while, on the outside, she has never demanded his total love, on the inside, she has slowly but surely been crumbling away. She loves him more than anyone, and it’s hard to see this kind of love not being returned.","S.A.: “Out of the question, the English have always told the truth over the wireless. And suppose they do exaggerate the news, the facts are bad enough anyway, because you can’t deny that many millions of peace-loving people were just simply murdered or gassed in Poland and Russia.”"
"Ik zit heel gezellig in het voorkantoor naar buiten te kijken, door de spleet van het zware gordijn. Het is schemerdonker, maar nog net licht genoeg om je te schrijven.","I'm sitting comfortably in the front office, looking out through the crack of the heavy curtain. It's twilight, but just bright enough to write you.","I’m sitting here nice and cozy in the front office, peering out through a chink in the heavy curtains.

"Ik dacht zo ongeveer: ‘O, zo bereik ik Peter nooit. Wie weet vindt hij me helemaal niet aardig en heeft hij geen behoefte aan vertrouwen. Misschien denkt hij wel nooit meer dan oppervlakkig aan me. Ik moet weer alleen verder, zonder vertrouwen en zonder Peter. Wellicht gauw weer zonder hoop, troost en verwachting. O, kon ik mijn hoofd nu maar tegen zijn schouder aanvlijen en me niet zo hopeloos alleen en verlaten voelen! Wie weet, geeft hij wel helemaal niet om me en kijkt hij de anderen ook zo zacht aan. Heb ik het me misschien wel verbeeld, dat dit voor mij was? O Peter, kon je me maar horen of zien. Doch de waarheid, die misschien zo teleurstellend is, zou ik niet kunnen verdragen’.","I was like, 'Oh, I'll never reach Peter like that. Who knows, maybe he doesn't like me at all and doesn't need trust. Perhaps he never thinks more than superficially of me. I have to go on alone again, without trust and without Peter. Perhaps soon again without hope, comfort and expectation. Oh, if only I could lay my head against his shoulder and not feel so hopelessly alone and forsaken! Who knows, maybe he doesn't care about me at all and looks at the others so softly too. Did I perhaps imagine that this was for me? Oh Peter, if only you could hear or see me. But the truth, which may be so disappointing, I could not bear.""","“Oh, I’ll never reach Peter this way. Who knows, maybe he doesn’t even like me and he doesn’t need anyone to confide in. Maybe he only thinks of me in a casual sort of way. I’ll have to go back to being alone, without anyone to confide in and without Peter, without hope, comfort or anything to look forward to. Oh, if only I could rest my head on his shoulder and not feel so hopelessly alone and deserted! Who knows, maybe he doesn’t care for me at all and looks at the others in the same tender way. Maybe I only imagined it was especially for me. Oh, Peter, if only you could hear me or see me. If the truth is disappointing, I won’t be able to bear it.”","This is what was going through my mind: 'Oh, I’ll never reach Peter like this. Who knows, perhaps he doesn’t like me at all and doesn’t need anyone to confide in. Perhaps he only thinks about me in a casual sort of way. I shall have to go on alone once more, without friendship and without Peter. Perhaps soon I’ll be without hope, without comfort, or anything to look forward to again. Oh, if I could nestle my head against his shoulder and not feel so hopelessly alone and deserted! Who knows, perhaps he doesn’t care about me at all and looks at the others in just the same way. Perhaps I only imagined that it was especially for me? Oh Peter, if only you could see or hear me. If the truth were to prove as bad as I suspect, it would be more than I could bear.’"

I finally stayed where I was, brooding. Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I’m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a “diary,” unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won’t make a bit of difference. Now I’m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don’t have a friend.","There is a saying that 'paper is more patient than man’; it came back to me on one of my slightly melancholy days, while I sat chin in hand, feeling too bored and limp even to make up my mind whether to go out or stay at home.

And now I come to the root of the matter, the reason for my starting a diary: it is that I have no such real friend."

Peter tackled me, turned my insides out, isn't it self-evident for every person that he must then rest in order to recover his insides?","And what awaits me at the bottom of those fourteen stairs? Bright lights, questions and laughter. I have to act normally and hope they don’t notice anything. My heart is still too tender to be able to recover so quickly from a shock like the one I had last night. The gentle Anne makes infrequent appearances, and she’s not about to let herself be shoved out the door so soon after she’s arrived. Peter’s reached a part of me that no one has ever reached before, except in my dream! He’s taken hold of me and turned me inside out. Doesn’t everyone need a little quiet time to put themselves to rights again?","And what do I have to face, when I reach the bottom of the staircase? Bright lights, questions, and laughter, I have to swallow it all and not show a thing. My heart still feels too much; I can’t get over a shock such as I received yesterday all at once. The Anne who is gentle shows herself too little anyway and, therefore, will not allow herself to be suddenly driven into the background. Peter has touched my emotions more deeply than anyone has ever done before—except in my dreams. Peter has taken possession of me and turned me inside out, surely it goes without saying that anyone would require a rest and a little while to recover from such an upheaval?"

"Aan de andere kant weet ik zeker, dat ik met Peter toch nooit zover gekomen zou zijn, omdat ik het gevoel heb dat ik met dengene, met wien ik veel zou willen bespreken, op een tamelijk intieme voet zou moeten staan. Ik zou het gevoel moeten hebben dat hij mij, ook zonder dat ik veel zeg, door en door begrijpt. Maar daarom moet het iemand zijn, in wien ik geestelijk mijn meerdere voel en dat is bij Peter nooit het geval. Bij jou zou ik mij het bovenstaande wel met Peter kunnen indenken.","On the other hand, I am sure that I would never have come this far with Peter, because I have the feeling that I should be on a fairly intimate footing with the person with whom I would like to discuss a lot. I should have the feeling that he understands me through and through, even without me saying much. But that is why it must be someone in whom I feel my superior spiritually, and that is never the case with Peter. With you I could imagine the above with Peter.","On the other hand, I’m certain I’d never have gotten as far with Peter, because I think I’d need to feel very close to a person before I could share my thoughts. I’d want to have the feeling that he understood me through and through, even if I didn’t say much. For this reason it would have to be someone I felt was intellectually superior to me, and that isn’t the case with Peter. But I can imagine your feeling close to him.","On the other hand, I know for certain that I would never have got so far with Peter, anyway, because I have the feeling that if I wished to discuss a lot with anyone, I should want to be on rather intimate terms with him. I would want to have the feeling that he understood me through and through without my having to say much. But for that reason it would have to be someone whom I felt was my superior intellectually, and that is not the case with Peter. But I can imagine it being so with you and Peter."

Tevreden gaat mijnheer Van Santen op de divan zitten of tegen de schrijftafel leunen. De krant, het kopje en meestal de poes naast zich.

"Wij drieën wachtten nu af. Nog geen twee minuten later kwam mevrouw, die beneden in het privé-kantoor naar de radio had geluisterd, naar boven. Ze vertelde dat Pim haar verzocht had de radio af te draaien en zachtjes naar boven te gaan. Maar hoe gaat het, als men heel zachtjes wil lopen, dan kraken de treden van een oude trap juist dubbel hard. Weer vijf minuten daarna kwamen Peter en Pim, wit tot aan hun neuspuntjes, en vertelden ons hun wederwaardigheden.","The three of us now waited. Less than two minutes later, the lady, who had been listening to the radio downstairs in the private office, came upstairs. She said that Pim had asked her to turn off the radio and go upstairs quietly. But how is it, if you want to walk very gently, then the steps of an old staircase creak twice as hard. Another five minutes later, Peter and Pim, white up to the tips of their noses, came and told us their adventures.","The three of us waited while Father and Peter went downstairs. A minute or two later Mrs. van Daan came up from where she’d been listening to the radio and told us that Pim had asked her to turn it off and tiptoe upstairs. But you know what happens when you’re trying to be quiet—the old stairs creaked twice as loud. Five minutes later Peter and Pim, the color drained from their faces, appeared again to relate their experiences.","The three of us waited in suspense. A minute or two later Mrs. van Daan came upstairs; she’d been listening to the wireless in the private oﬃce. She told us that Pim had asked her to turn off the wireless and go softly upstairs. But you know what that’s like, if you want to be extra quiet, then each step of the old stairs creaks twice as loudly. Five minutes later Pim and Peter appeared again, white to the roots of their hair, and told us their experience."
"Zaterdagavond heb ik Peter gevraagd of hij vindt, dat ik vader iets van ons moet vertellen, hij vond na een beetje heen en weer van wel. Ik was blij, het getuigt van zuiver voelen bij hem. Dadelijk toen ik beneden kwam, ging ik met vader mee water halen, op de trap zei ik al: ‘Vader, je begrijpt zeker wel, dat als Peter en ik samen zijn, we geen meter van elkaar afzitten, vind je dat erg?’ Vader antwoordde niet dadelijk, dan zei hij: ‘Neen, erg vind ik het niet, maar Anne, hier in die beperkte ruimte moet je voorzichtig zijn’. Hij zei nog iets in die geest, toen gingen we naar boven. Zondagochtend riep hij me bij zich en zei: ‘Anne, ik heb er nog eens over nagedacht’ - ik werd al bang -. Het is hier in het Achterhuis eigenlijk niet zo goed, ik dacht, dat jullie kameraden waren. Is Peter verliefd?’","Saturday evening I asked Peter if he thinks I should tell father something about us, after a bit of back and forth he thought so. I was happy, it shows a pure feeling with him. As soon as I came downstairs, I went with father to fetch water, on the stairs I already said: 'Father, you certainly understand that when Peter and I are together, we are not a meter apart, do you mind?' Father did not answer immediately, then he said: 'No, I don't mind, but Anne, you have to be careful here in that limited space'. He said something else in that spirit, then we went upstairs. On Sunday morning he called me over and said: ""Anne, I've thought about it again"" - I was getting scared -. It's actually not that good here in the Secret Annex, I thought you were comrades. Is Peter in love?”","Saturday night I asked Peter whether he thinks I should tell Father about us. After we’d discussed it, he said he thought I should. I was glad; it shows he’s sensible, and sensitive. As soon as I came downstairs, I went with Father to get some water. While we were on the stairs, I said, “Father, I’m sure you’ve gathered that when Peter and I are together, we don’t exactly sit at opposite ends of the room. Do you think that’s wrong?” Father paused before answering: “No, I don’t think it’s wrong. But Anne, when you’re living so close together, as we do, you have to be careful.” He said some other words to that effect, and then we went upstairs. Sunday morning he called me to him and said, “Anne, I’ve been thinking about what you said.” (Oh, oh, I knew what was coming!) “Here in the Annex it’s not such a good idea. I thought you were just friends. Is Peter in love with you?”","On Saturday evening I asked Peter whether he thought I ought to tell Daddy a bit about us; when we’d discussed it a little, he came to the conclusion that I should. I was glad, for it shows that he’s an honest boy. As soon as I got downstairs I went off with Daddy to get some water; and while we were on the stairs I said, “Daddy, I expect you’ve gathered that when we’re together Peter and I don’t sit miles apart. Do you think it’s wrong?” Daddy didn’t reply immediately, then said, “No I don’t think it’s wrong, but you must be careful, Anne; you’re in such a confined space here.” When we went upstairs, he said something else on the same lines. On Sunday morning he called me to him and said, “Anne, I have thought more about what you said.” I felt scared already. “It’s not really very right —here in this house; I thought that you were just pals. Is Peter in love?”"

"We kwamen met de meest uiteenlopende voorstellen voor de dag om haar af te wimpelen. Van Daan vond, dat een goed laxeermiddel in haar koffie misschien afdoende zou zijn. ‘Neen’, antwoordde mijnheer Koophuis, ‘alsjeblieft niet, dan komt ze helemaal niet meer van de doos!’ Daverend gelach. ‘Van de doos?’ vroeg mevrouw, ‘Wat betekent dat?’ Een uitleg volgde. ‘Kan ik dat altijd gebruiken?’ vroeg ze daarna heel onnozel. ‘Stel je voor’, gichelde Elli, ‘dat je in de Bijenkorf naar de doos vroeg, ze zouden je niet eens begrijpen!’","We came up with the most diverse proposals to brush her off. Van Daan thought that a good laxative in her coffee might be sufficient. ""No,"" replied Mr Koophuis, ""please don't, then she won't come off the box at all!"" Thunderous laughter. 'From the box?' asked the lady, 'What does that mean?' An explanation followed. “Can I always use that?” she asked, very silly. ""Imagine,"" Elli giggled, ""if you asked for the box in the Beehive, they wouldn't even understand you!""","We proposed a variety of ways to get rid of her. Mr. van Daan thought a good laxative in her coffee might do the trick. “No,” Mr. Kleiman answered, “please don’t, or we’ll never get her off the can!” A roar of laughter. “The can?” Mrs. van D. asked. “What does that mean?” An explanation was given. “Is it all right to use that word?” she asked in perfect innocence. “Just imagine,” Bep giggled, “there you are shopping at The Bijenkorf and you ask the way to the can. They wouldn’t even know what you were talking about!” Dussel now sits on the “can,” to borrow the expression, every day at twelve-thirty on the dot. This afternoon 1 boldly took a piece of pink paper and wrote: Mr. Dussel’s Toilet Timetable Mornings from 7:15 to 7:30 A.M. Afternoons after 1 P.M. Otherwise, only as needed! I tacked this to the green bathroom door while he was still inside. I might well have added “Transgressors will be subject to confinement!” Because our bathroom can be locked from both the inside and the outside. Mr. van Daan’s latest joke: After a Bible lesson about Adam and Eve, a thirteen-year-old boy asked his father, “Tell me, Father, how did I get born?” “Well,” the father replied, “the stork plucked you out of the ocean, set you down in Mother’s bed and bit her in the leg, hard. It bled so much she had to stay in bed for a week.” Not fully satisfied, the boy went to his mother. “Tell me, Mother,” he asked, “how did you get born and how did I get born?” His mother told him the very same story. Finally, hoping to hear the fine points, he went to his grandfather. “Tell me, Grandfather,” he said, “how did you get born and how did your daughter get born?” And for the third time he was told exactly the same story. That night he wrote in his diary: “After careful inquiry, I must conclude that there has been no sexual intercourse in our family for the last three generations!”","We thought up the wildest and most varied suggestions to wheedle her away. van Daan thought that a good laxative in her coffee would be suﬃcient. “No,” replied Kleiman, “I beg of you not, then we’d never get her off the box!” Resounding laughter. “Off the box,” asked Mrs. van Daan, “what does that mean?” An explanation followed. “Can I always use it?” she then asked stupidly. “Imagine,” Bep giggled, “if one asked for the box at the Bijenkorf, they wouldn’t even understand what you mean!”"

Onschuldige vooraanstaande burgers worden gevangen gezet, om op hun veroordeling te wachten. Als iemand gesaboteerd heeft en de dader wordt niet gevonden, zet de Gestapo doodgewoon een stuk of 5 gijzelaars tegen de muur. Vaak staan er doodsberichten van deze mannen in de krant. Als een ‘noodlottig ongeval’ wordt deze misdaad daar betiteld. Fraai volk, de Duitsers. En daar behoorde ik ook eens toe! Maar neen, Hitler heeft ons al lang statenloos gemaakt.

You read the announcements of their death in the paper, where they’re referred to as “fatal accidents.” Fine specimens of humanity, those Germans, and to think I’m actually one of them!

We played with Moffi, amused ourselves, chatted and then strolled through the sprawling warehouse to the door.","But Peter went on talking in a normal voice about what is otherwise a very awkward subject. Nor did he have any ulterior motives. By the time he’d finished, I felt so much at ease that I started acting normally too. We played with Boche, had a good time, chatted a bit and finally sauntered through the long warehouse to the door.","But Peter went on talking quite normally on what is otherwise such a painful subject, without meaning anything unpleasant, and finally put me suﬃciently at my ease for me to be normal too.

"Wat zijn ze allemaal stom! Wij mogen geen oordeel hebben. Ja, ze zijn verschrikkelijk modern. Geen oordeel hebben! Men kan zeggen, je moet je mond houden, maar geen oordeel hebben bestaat niet. Niemand kan een ander zijn oordeel verbieden, al is die ander nog zo jong.","How stupid are they all! We must not judge. Yes, they are terribly modern. Have no judgment! One can say, you should keep your mouth shut, but there is no such thing as no judgment. No one can forbid another's judgment, no matter how young that other person is.","They’re all so stupid! I also talked to Margot about Father and Mother, about how nice it could be here if they weren’t so aggravating. We’d be able to organize evenings in which everyone could take turns discussing a given subject. But we’ve already been through all that. It’s impossible for me to talk here! Mr. van Daan goes on the offensive, Mother gets sarcastic and can’t say anything in a normal voice, Father doesn’t feel like taking part, nor does Mr. Dussel, and Mrs. van D. is attacked so often that she just sits there with a red face, hardly able to put up a fight anymore. And what about us? We aren’t allowed to have an opinion! My, my, aren’t they progressive! Not have an opinion! People can tell you to shut up, but they can’t keep you from having an opinion. You can’t forbid someone to have an opinion, no matter how young they are!","Aren’t they all stupid! We aren’t allowed to have any opinions. People can tell you to keep your mouth shut, but it doesn’t stop you having your own opinion. Even if people are still very young, they shouldn’t be prevented from saying what they think."
"Hoe komt het nu, dat vader me in mijn strijd nooit tot steun is geweest, dat hij helemaal missloeg toen hij me de helpende hand wou bieden? Vader heeft de verkeerde middelen aangepakt, hij heeft altijd tot me gesproken als tot een kind, dat moeilijke kindertijden moest doormaken. Dat klinkt gek, want niemand anders dan vader heeft me steeds veel vertrouwen geschonken en niemand anders dan vader heeft me het gevoel gegeven, dat ik verstandig ben. Maar één ding heeft hij verwaarloosd: hij heeft er namelijk niet aan gedacht, dat mijn vechten om er bovenop te komen voor mij belangrijker was dan al het andere. Ik wou niet van ‘leeftijdsverschijnsels’, ‘andere meisjes’, ‘gaat vanzelf over’ horen, ik wou niet als meisje-zoals-alle-anderen, maar als Anne-op-zichzelf behandeld worden. Dat begreep Pim niet. Trouwens ik kan iemand niet mijn vertrouwen geven, die mij ook niet heel veel van zichzelf vertelt en omdat ik van Pim zeer weinig afweet, zal ik de weg naar het intieme tussen ons niet kunnen betreden.","How come that Father has never supported me in my struggle, that he completely failed when he wanted to lend me a helping hand? Father has taken the wrong means, he has always spoken to me as to a child who had to go through difficult childhoods. That sounds crazy, because no one but father has always given me much confidence and no one but father has made me feel that I am sensible. But one thing he neglected: he didn't think that my struggle to get over it was more important to me than anything else. I didn't want to hear about 'age phenomena', 'other girls', 'will pass on its own', I didn't want to be treated as a girl-like-all the others, but as Anne-in-herself. Pim didn't understand that. Besides, I can't trust someone who doesn't tell me very much about himself either, and because I know very little about Pim, I won't be able to enter the intimate path between us.","Why didn’t Father support me in my struggle? Why did he fall short when he tried to offer me a helping hand? The answer is: he used the wrong methods. He always talked to me as if I were a child going through a difficult phase. It sounds crazy, since Father’s the only one who’s given me a sense of confidence and made me feel as if I’m a sensible person. But he overlooked one thing: he failed to see that this struggle to triumph over my difficulties was more important to me than anything else. I didn’t want to hear about “typical adolescent problems,” or “other girls,” or “you’ll grow out of it.” I didn’t want to be treated the same as all-the-other-girls, but as Anne-in-her-own-right, and Pim didn’t understand that. Besides, I can’t confide in anyone unless they tell me a lot about themselves, and because I know very little about him, I can’t get on a more intimate footing.","How is it that Daddy was never any support to me in my struggle? Why did he completely miss the mark when he wanted to offer me a helping hand? Daddy tried the wrong methods, he always talked to me as a child who was going through diﬃcult phases. It sounds crazy, because Daddy’s the only one who has always taken me into his confidence, and no one but Daddy has given me the feeling that I’m sensible. But there’s one thing he’s omitted: you see, he hasn’t realised that for me the fight to get the better of my problems was more important than all else. I didn’t want to hear about 'symptoms of your age’ or 'other girls,’ or 'it wears off by itself.’ I didn’t want to be treated as a girl-like- all-others, but as Anne-on-her-own-merits. Pim didn’t understand that. For that matter, I can’t confide in anyone, unless they tell me a lot about themselves, and as I know very little about Pim, I don’t feel that I can tread upon more intimate ground with him."
"Hij klampt zich vast aan zijn eenzaamheid, zijn gemaakte onverschilligheid en zijn volwassenheid om maar niet uit zijn rol te vallen, om nooit, nooit te tonen hoe hij zich voelt. Arme Peter, hoe lang kan deze rol nog duren? Zal op die bovenmenselijke inspanning geen verschrikkelijke uitbarsting volgen?","He clings to his loneliness, his faked indifference and his maturity so as not to fall out of his role, to never, never show how he feels. Poor Peter, how long can this part last? Won't that superhuman effort be followed by a terrible eruption?","He clings to his masculinity, his solitude and his feigned indifference so he can maintain his role, so he’ll never, ever have to show his feelings. Poor Peter, how long can he keep it up? Won’t he explode from this superhuman effort?","He clings to his solitude, to his affected indifference and his grown-up ways, but it’s just an act, so as never, never to show his real feelings. Poor Peter, how long will he be able to go on playing this role? Surely a terrible outburst must follow as the result of this superhuman effort?"
"Door deze dingen ben ik er toe gekomen mijn levensbeschouwingen en mijn goed overdachte theorieën nooit aan iemand anders mee te delen dan aan mijn dagboek en een enkele keer aan Margot. Voor vader verborg ik alles wat mezelf beroerde: ik heb hem nooit in mijn idealen laten delen, heb hem willens en wetens van me vervreemd.","These things have led me to never communicate my philosophies and my well-thought-out theories to anyone but my diary and occasionally to Margot. From father I hid everything that troubled myself: I never let him share in my ideals, I knowingly alienated him from me.","As a result, I’ve never shared my outlook on life or my long-pondered theories with anyone but my diary and, once in a while, Margot. I’ve hid anything having to do with me from Father, never shared my ideals with him, deliberately alienated myself from him.","These things have made me never mention my views on life nor my well-considered theories to anyone but my diary and, occasionally, to Margot. I concealed from Daddy everything that perturbed me; I never shared my ideals with him. I was aware of the fact that I was distancing him from me."

"Het voorwerp van mijn vriendschap is tenminste altijd in huis en ik hoef, behalve voor Margot, niet bang voor rivalen te zijn. Denk niet, dat ik verliefd ben, dat is niet waar, maar ik heb aldoor het gevoel, dat er tussen Peter en mij nog eens iets moois zal groeien, iets dat vriendschap is en vertrouwen geeft. Als het maar even kan ga ik naar hem toe en het is niet meer zoals vroeger, dat hij niet goed weet wat met me te beginnen. Integendeel, hij praat nog als ik al haast de deur uit ben.","At least the object of my friendship is always in the house and I need not fear rivals except for Margot. Don't think I'm in love, that's not true, but I always have the feeling that something beautiful will grow between Peter and me, something that is friendship and gives confidence. Whenever I can, I go to him and it's not like it used to be, that he doesn't quite know what to do with me. On the contrary, he still talks when I'm almost out the door.","At least the object of my friendship is always here, and I don’t have to be afraid of rivals (except for Margot).

"‘Welke boeken zijn bedorven?’ vroeg ik aan Margot, die mijn boekenschat aan het controleren was. ‘Algebra’, zei Margot. Ik kwam gauw naderbij, maar jammer genoeg was ook het algebraboek nog niet bedorven. Ik wou dat dat in de vaas was gevallen: ik heb nog nooit aan één boek zo'n hekel gehad als aan dat algebraboek. Voorin staan minstens 20 namen van meisjes, die het al vóór mij in hun bezit hadden, het is oud, geel, volgekrabbeld en verbeterd. Als ik nog eens heel erg baldadig ben, scheur ik dat rotding aan stukken!","“Which books are corrupted?” I asked Margot, who was checking my treasure trove. “Algebra,” said Margot. I quickly approached, but unfortunately the algebra book was not spoiled either. I wish that had fallen into the vase: I've never hated one book as much as that algebra book.

Inside the front cover are the names of at least twenty girls who had it before I did. It’s old, yellowed, full of scribbles, crossed-out words and revisions. The next time I’m in a wicked mood, I’m going to tear the darned thing to pieces!","“Which books are spoiled?” I asked Margot, who was checking up on them. “Algebra,” she said.

"Drie dingen deden we nu, veronderstellingen uiten, bibberen van angst en naar de W.C. moeten. De emmers waren op de zolder, alleen de blikken prullemand van Peter kon dienst doen. Van Daan maakte een begin, daarna kwam vader, moeder schaamde zich te veel.

Steeds was er vraag naar wat papier, ik had gelukkig in mijn zak.","Three things we did now, make assumptions, shiver with fear and go to the toilet. should.

There was a great demand for paper, and luckily I had some in my pocket.","Next we did three things: we went over again what we supposed had happened, we trembled with fear, and we had to go to the lavatory.

"Eén ding, het mag misschien onbenullig lijken, heb ik haar nooit vergeven. Het was op een dag dat ik naar den tandarts moest. Moeder en Margot zouden meegaan en vonden het goed, dat ik mijn fiets meenam.

Then I became so furious that I stuck my tongue out at them in the street just as an old woman happened to pass by, who looked very shocked! I rode home on my bicycle, and I know I cried for a long time."

"Mevrouw Van Daan is onuitstaanbaar. Ik krijg van boven voortdurend standjes voor mijn onophoudelijk geklets. Altijd is er iets anders waarmee ze ons plaagt; nu doet ze het zo, dat ze de pannen niet wil afwassen en als er nog een tipseltje inzit, doet ze dat niet in een glazen schotel, zoals het tot nu toe gedaan werd, maar laat het in de pan bederven. Bij de volgende afwas heeft Margot dan wel eens zeven vuile pannen en dan zegt madame wel: ‘Margotje, Margotje, wat heb je veel te doen!’","Mrs. Van Daan is insufferable. I am constantly scolded from above for my incessant chatter. There is always something else she teases us with; now she does it in such a way that she does not want to wash the pans, and if there is still a little tip in it, she does not put it in a glass dish, as it was done until now, but let it spoil in the pan. With the next wash Margot sometimes has seven dirty pans and Madame will say: 'Margotje, Margotje, you have so much to do!'","The male members of the van Daan contingent have built a very handy wood-stained food safe, with real screens. Up to now this glorious cupboard has been located in Peter’s room, but in the interests of fresh air it’s been moved to the attic. Where it once stood, there’s now a shelf. I advised Peter to put his table underneath the shelf, add a nice rug and hang his own cupboard where the table now stands. That might make his little cubbyhole more comfy, though I certainly wouldn’t like to sleep there. Mrs. van Daan is unbearable. I’m continually being scolded for my incessant chatter when I’m upstairs. I simply let the words bounce right off me! Madame now has a new trick up her sleeve: trying to get out of washing the pots and pans. If there’s a bit of food left at the bottom of the pan, she leaves it to spoil instead of transferring it to a glass dish. Then in the afternoon when Margot is stuck with cleaning all the pots and pans, Madame exclaims, “Oh, poor Margot, you have so much work to do!”","Mrs. van Daan is unbearable. I get nothing but 'blow-ups’ from her for my continuous chatter. She is always pestering us in some way or other. This is the latest: she doesn’t want to wash up the pans if there is a fragment left, instead of putting it into a glass dish, as we’ve always done until now, she leaves it in the pan to go bad. After the next meal Margot sometimes has about seven pans to wash up and then Madame says, “Well, well,  Margot, you have got a lot to do!”"
"Vader zegt altijd dat ik een nuf ben, dat is niet waar, ik ben alleen maar ijdel! Ik heb nog niet van veel mensen gehoord, dat ze me knap van uiterlijk vinden. Behalve dan van een jongen op school, die zei dat ik er zo leuk uitzag als ik lachte. Gisteren nu kreeg ik een oprecht compliment van Peter en ik zal voor de aardigheid ons gesprek zo ongeveer weergeven:","Father always says I'm a nuf, that's not true, I'm just vain! I haven't heard from many people that they think I look pretty. Except from a boy at school who said I looked so cute when I smiled. Just yesterday I got a sincere compliment from Peter and for the sake of fun I'll summarize our conversation like this:","I can’t tell you how often the conversation at meals has been about an Annex wedding, should the war last another five years. Do we take any notice of this parental chitchat? Hardly, since it’s all so silly. Have my parents forgotten that they were young once? Apparently they have. At any rate, they laugh at us when we’re serious, and they’re serious when we’re joking. I don’t know what’s going to happen next, or whether we’ll run out of things to say. But if it goes on like this, we’ll eventually be able to be together without talking. If only his parents would stop acting so strangely. It’s probably because they don’t like seeing me so often; Peter and I certainly never tell them what we talk about. Imagine if they knew we were discussing such intimate things. I’d like to ask Peter whether he knows what girls look like down there. I don’t think boys are as complicated as girls. You can easily see what boys look like in photographs or pictures of male nudes, but with women it’s different. In women, the genitals, or whatever they’re called, are hidden between their legs. Peter has probably never seen a girl up close. To tell you the truth, neither have I. Boys are a lot easier. How on earth would I go about describing a girl’s parts? I can tell from what he said that he doesn’t know exactly how it all fits together. He was talking about the","Daddy always says I’m prudish and vain but that’s not true , I’m just simply vain! I have not often had anyone tell me I was pretty. Except a boy at school; who said I looked so attractive when I laughed. Yesterday I received a genuine compliment from Peter, and just for fun I will tell you roughly how the conversation went:"
"‘Als ik dat zeg, dan kun je dat van mij aannemen!’","""If I say that, you can take it from me!""","In the upper part, between the outer labia, there’s a fold of skin that, on second thought, looks like a kind of blister.","“If I say so, then you can take it from me it is!”"
"De aanleiding van de ‘als, als’ is, dat mijnheer Kraler opgeroepen is om te spitten, Elli meer dan snipverkouden is en waarschijnlijk morgen thuis moet blijven, Miep van haar griep nog niet genezen is en Koophuis een maagbloeding met bewusteloosheid heeft gehad. Een ware treurlijst!","The reason for the 'if, if' is that Mr. Kraler has been called up to dig, Elli has a bad cold and will probably have to stay home tomorrow, Miep has not yet recovered from her flu and Koophuis suffered a stomach bleed with unconsciousness. A true sorrow list!","The reason for all the “ifs” is that Mr. Kugler has been called up for a six-day work detail, Bep is down with a bad cold and will probably have to stay home tomorrow, Miep hasn’t gotten over her flu, and Mr. Kleiman’s stomach bled so much he lost consciousness. What a tale of woe!","The reason for all this 'if, if’ is that Mr. Kugler has been called up to go digging. Bep has a streaming cold and will probably have to stay at home tomorrow. Miep hasn’t fully recovered from her uu yet, and Kleiman has had such bad hemorrhage of the stomach that he lost consciousness. What a tale of woe!"
"Aan tafel is de stemming meestal gespannen, gelukkig worden de uitbarstingen nog wel eens door de soep-eters tegengehouden. De soep-eters zijn allen, die van kantoor komen en dan een kopje soep krijgen.","At the table the mood is usually tense, luckily the eruptions are sometimes stopped by the soup eaters. The soup-eaters are all who come from the office and get a cup of soup.","During meals the air is filled with tension. Fortunately, the outbursts are sometimes held in check by the “soup eaters,” the people from the office who come up to have a cup of soup for lunch.","The atmosphere at table is usually strained, though luckily the outbursts are sometimes checked by 'the soup eaters’!

"Vanmorgen vroeg Peter, of ik 's avonds eens meer kwam en zei, dat ik hem heus niet stoorde, dat er bij hem in de kamer, zo goed als er plaats voor één is, ook plaats voor twee is. Ik zei dat ik niet elke avond kon, dat ze dat beneden niet goed vonden, maar hij vond, dat ik me daar niet aan moest storen. Ik zei toen, dat ik 's Zaterdagavonds graag eens zou komen en vroeg hem me vooral eens te waarschuwen als de maan er was. ‘Dan gaan we naar beneden’, antwoordde hij, ‘daar de maan bekijken’.","This morning Peter asked if I would come again in the evening and said that I really wouldn't disturb him, that there is room for two in his room, as good as there is room for one. I said I couldn't make it every night, that they didn't approve of that downstairs, but he didn't think it should bother me. I then said that I would like to come on Saturday evening and asked him to warn me when the moon came. ""Then we'll go down,"" he replied, ""look at the moon there.""","This morning Peter asked me if I’d come again one evening. He swore I wouldn’t be disturbing him, and said that where there was room for one, there was room for two. I said I couldn’t see him every evening, since my parents didn’t think it was a good idea, but he thought I shouldn’t let that bother me. So I told him I’d like to come some Saturday evening and also asked him if he’d let me know when you could see the moon. “Sure,” he said, “maybe we can go downstairs and look at the moon from there.” I agreed; I’m not really so scared of burglars.","This morning Peter asked me if I would come again one evening and said that I really didn’t disturb him, and if there’s room for one there ’s room for two. I said that I couldn’t come every evening, because they wouldn’t like it downstairs, but he thought that I needn’t let that bother me. Then I said that I would love to come one Saturday evening and especially asked him to tell me when there was a moon. “Then we’ll go downstairs,” he answered, “and look at the moon from there.”"
"Oef, het wordt vervelend en een hele toer om er geen saaie bes bij te worden. Bij de ouelui kan dat laatste zo'n kwaad niet meer!","Phew, it's getting boring and a lot of work not to become a boring berry. With the old people, the latter can no longer be such a bad thing!","Whew! It’s getting to be a bore, and it’s all I can do to keep from turning into a dreary old crone myself! Though with all the old folks around me, that might not be such a bad idea!","Ugh! It gets so boring, and it’s quite a job not to become a dull old stick oneself. Politics can’t do much more harm to the parents!"
We stonden al op de trap en ik hield verder mijn mond.,We were already on the stairs and I kept my mouth shut.,"We were already on the stairs, so nothing more was said.","We were already on the stairs, so I kept my mouth shut after that."
"Ik heb sterk het gevoel, dat Peter en ik helemaal niet zoveel verschillen als dat van buiten wel lijkt en ik zal je ook uitleggen waarom. Peter en ik missen alle twee een moeder. De zijne is te oppervlakkig, flirt graag en bekommert zich niet veel om zijn gedachten. De mijne bemoeit zich wel met me, maar mist het fijne gevoel, het moederbegrip.","I have a strong feeling that Peter and I are not as different as it seems from the outside and I will also explain to you why. Peter and I both miss a mother. His is too superficial, likes to flirt and doesn't care much about his thoughts. Mine does interfere with me, but lacks the nice feeling, the mother understanding.","I have the strong feeling that Peter and I aren’t really as different as we may seem on the surface, and I’ll explain why: neither Peter nor I have a mother. His is too superficial, likes to flirt and doesn’t concern herself much with what goes on in his head. Mine takes an active interest in my life, but has no tact, sensitivity or motherly understanding.","I have a strong feeling that Peter and I are really not so different as we would appear to be and I will tell you why. We both lack caring mothers. His is too superficial, loves uirting and doesn’t trouble much about what he thinks. Mine does bother about me, but lacks sensitiveness, real motherliness."
"Een tijd lang waren we veel samen, maar overigens bleef mijn liefde onbeantwoord. Toen kwam Peter op mijn weg en ik kreeg een echte kinderverliefdheid te pakken. Hij mocht mij eveneens graag en een zomer door waren we onafscheidelijk. Ik zie ons in gedachten nog hand in hand door de straten lopen, hij in een wit katoenen pak, ik in een korte zomerjurk. Aan het einde van de grote vacantie kwam hij in de eerste klas van de middelbare school en ik in de zesde klas van de lagere school. Hij haalde me van school af en omgekeerd haalde ik hem. Peter was een beeld van een jongen, groot, knap, slank met een ernstig, rustig en intelligent gezicht. Hij had donker haar en prachtig bruine ogen, roodbruine wangen en een spitse neus. Vooral op zijn lach was ik dol, dan zag hij er zo kwajongensachtig en ondeugend uit. Ik ging in de vacantie naar buiten; toen ik terugkwam was Peter inmiddels verhuisd en woonde samen met een veel ouderen jongen. Deze maakte hem er schijnbaar opmerkzaam op, dat ik een kinderachtige puk was en Peter liet me los. Ik hield zoveel van hem, dat ik de waarheid niet wilde inzien en hem vasthield, tot de dag kwam, waarop het tot me doordrong, dat ik, als ik hem nog langer achterna liep, voor jongensgek uitgemaakt zou worden. De jaren gingen voorbij. Peter ging met meisjes van zijn eigen leeftijd om en dacht er niet meer aan mij te groeten, maar ik kon hem niet vergeten. Ik ging naar het Joodse Lyceum, vele jongens van onze klas werden verliefd op me, ik vond het leuk, was vereerd, maar verder raakte het mij niet. Nog weer later was Harry dol op me, maar zoals al gezegd, ik werd nooit meer verliefd.","For a while we were together a lot, but otherwise my love remained unrequited. Then Peter came my way and I got hold of a real childhood crush. He also liked me and we were inseparable through the summer. I can still picture us walking hand in hand through the streets, he in a white cotton suit, me in a short summer dress. At the end of the big vacation, he entered the first grade of secondary school and I entered the sixth grade of primary school. He picked me up from school and I picked him up vice versa. Peter was a picture of a boy, tall, handsome, slender, with a serious, calm and intelligent face. He had dark hair and beautiful brown eyes, russet cheeks and a pointed nose. I especially loved his smile, it made him look so mischievous and naughty. I went out on vacation; when I returned, Peter had moved and lived with a much older boy. This apparently alerted him that I was a childish pug and Peter let go of me. I loved him so much that I refused to see the truth and held on to him until the day came when it dawned on me that if I followed him any longer I would be called a boy madman. The years passed. Peter was hanging out with girls his own age and didn't remember to greet me, but I couldn't forget him. I went to the Jewish Lyceum, many boys in our class fell in love with me, I liked it, I was honored, but it didn't touch me beyond that. Later still, Harry was fond of me, but as I said, I never fell in love again.","For a long time we went everywhere together, but aside from that, my love was unrequited until Peter crossed my path. I had an out-and-out crush on him. He liked me too, and we were inseparable for one whole summer. I can still see us walking hand in hand through our neighborhood, Peter in a white cotton suit and me in a short summer dress. At the end of the summer vacation he went to the seventh grade at the middle school, while I was in the sixth grade at the grammar school. He’d pick me up on the way home, or I’d pick him up. Peter was the ideal boy: tall, good-looking and slender, with a serious, quiet and intelligent face. He had dark hair, beautiful brown eyes, ruddy cheeks and a nicely pointed nose. I was crazy about his smile, which made him look so boyish and mischievous. I’d gone away to the countryside during summer vacation, and when I came back, Peter was no longer at his old address; he’d moved and was living with a much older boy, who apparently told him I was just a kid, because Peter stopped seeing me. I loved him so much that I didn’t want to face the truth. I kept clinging to him until the day I finally realized that if I continued to chase after him, people would say I was boy-crazy. The years went by. Peter hung around with girls his own age and no longer bothered to say hello to me. I started school at the Jewish Lyceum, and several boys in my class were in love with me. I enjoyed it and felt honored by their attentions, but that was all. Later on, Hello had a terrible crush on me, but as I’ve already told you, I never fell in love again.","We used to be together a lot for quite a long time, but for the rest, my love was unreturned Then Peter crossed my path, and in my childish way I really fell in love. He liked me very much, too, and we were inseparable for one whole summer. I can still remember us walking hand in hand through the streets together, he in a white cotton suit and me in a short summer dress. At the end of the summer holidays he went into the first form of the high school and I into the sixth form of the lower school. He used to meet me from school and, vice versa, I would meet him. Peter was a very good-looking boy, tall, handsome, and slim, with an earnest, calm, intelligent face. He had dark hair, and wonderful brown eyes, ruddy cheeks, and a pointed nose. I was mad about his laugh, above all, when he looked so mischievous and naughty! I went to the country for the holidays, when I returned. Peter had in the meantime moved, and a much older boy lived in the same house. He apparently drew Peter’s attention to the fact that I was a childish little imp, and  Peter gave me up. I adored him so that I didn’t want to face the truth. I tried to hold on to him until it dawned on me that if I went on running after him I should soon get the name of being boy-mad. The years passed. Peter went around with girls of his own age and didn’t even think of saying 'Hello’ to me any more, but I couldn’t forget him. I went to the Jewish Secondary School. Lots of boys in our class were keen on me—I thought it was fun, felt honoured, but was otherwise quite untouched. Then later on, Hello was mad about me, but, as I’ve already told you, I never fell in love again."

"Margot en ik werden uit de kamer gestuurd. Van Daan wou met moeder alleen spreken. Toen Margot en ik in onze slaapkamer zaten, vertelde zij, dat de oproep niet vader maar haar betrof. Ik schrok opnieuw en begon toen te huilen. Margot is zestien; zulke jonge meisjes willen ze dus alleen weg laten gaan. Maar gelukkig zou ze niet gaan, moeder had het zelf gezegd en daarop zouden dan ook vaders woorden wel gedoeld hebben, toen hij het met mij over onderduiken had.","Margot and I were sent out of the room. Van Daan wanted to speak to mother alone. When Margot and I were in our bedroom, she told me that the call was not for Father, but for her. I was startled again and then started to cry. Margot is sixteen; so they want to let such young girls go away alone. But luckily she wouldn't go, mother had said so herself and that is what father's words would have meant when he talked to me about going into hiding.","Margot and I were sent from the room, as Mr. van Daan wanted to talk to Mother alone. When she and I were sitting in our bedroom, Margot told me that the call-up was not for Father, but for her. At this second shock, I began to cry. Margot is sixteen—apparently they want to send girls her age away on their own. But thank goodness she won’t be going; Mother had said so herself, which must be what Father had meant when he talked to me about our going into hiding.","Margot and I were sent out of the room. van Daan wanted to talk to Mummy alone. When we were alone together in our bedroom, Margot told me that the call-up was not for Daddy, but for her. I was more frightened than ever and began to cry.

But thank goodness she won’t go, Mummy said so herself; that must be what Daddy meant when he talked about us going into hiding."

"De 29ste was mevrouw Van Daan jarig. Hoewel het feest niet groots werd gevierd, werd ze toch wel vereerd met bloemen, kleine cadeau's en goed eten. Rode anjers van haar heer gemaal schijnt in de familie traditie te zijn. Om nog even bij mevrouw stil te blijven staan kan ik je zeggen, dat een bron van voortdurende ergernis voor mij haar flirtpogingen met vader zijn. Zij strijkt hem over wang en haar, trekt haar rokje heel hoog op, zegt zogenaamd geestige dingen en probeert zo Pims aandacht op zich te vestigen. Gelukkig vindt Pim haar niet mooi en ook niet leuk, hij gaat niet op die flirtations in. Ik ben nogal jaloers uitgevallen zoals je weet, dus dat kan ik niet hebben. Moeder doet dat toch ook niet bij mijnheer, dat heb ik haar ook in haar gezicht gezegd.","The 29th was Mrs. Van Daan's birthday. Although the feast was not celebrated on a grand scale, she was honored with flowers, small gifts and good food. Red carnations from her lord consort seem to be in the family tradition. To dwell on Madame for a moment, I can tell you that a source of constant annoyance for me is her attempts at flirting with father. She strokes his cheek and hair, pulls up her skirt very high, says supposedly witty things and tries to draw Pim's attention to herself. Fortunately, Pim does not find her beautiful or nice, he does not respond to those flirtations. I've been kind of jealous as you know, so I can't take that. Mother doesn't do that to sir either, I told her to her face.","Mrs. van Daan’s birthday was the twenty-ninth.

Let me pause a moment on the subject of Mrs. van Daan and tell you that her attempts to flirt with Father are a constant source of irritation to me. She pats him on the cheek and head, hikes up her skirt and makes so-called witty remarks in an effort to get’s Pim’s attention. Fortunately, he finds her neither pretty nor charming, so he doesn’t respond to her flirtations. As you know, I’m quite the jealous type, and I can’t abide her behavior. After all, Mother doesn’t act that way toward Mr. van D., which is what I told Mrs. van D. right to her face.","The twenty-ninth was Mrs. van Daan’s birthday.

"Toen ik bij Peter kwam, verontschuldigde ik me, dat ik hem nog eens moest storen.

Ik antwoordde, dat dat heus niet nodig was en dat ik nu geen kleine behoefde te halen. Toen was hij overtuigd en liet mijn arm los. Op de terugweg kwam hij het luik openen en pakte weer de pan van me aan. Bij de deur vroeg ik: ‘Wat ben je aan het doen?’ ‘Frans’, was het antwoord.

Convinced, he let go of my arm. On my way back, he opened the trapdoor and once again took the pan from me. Standing by the door, I asked, “What are you working on?” “French,” he replied.

"Maar om op ons opvoedingsthema terug te komen. Gisteren viel na mevrouws laatste woorden een stilte in.

"Vader, moeder en Margot laten me dan bij tijd en wijle onverschillig, ik dwaal van de ene naar de andere kamer, de trap af en weer op en heb een gevoel als een zangvogel, wiens vleugels hardhandig uitgerukt zijn en die in een volslagen duisternis tegen de spijlen van zijn nauwe kooi aanvliegt. ‘Naar buiten, lucht en lachen’, schreeuwt het in me. Ik antwoord niet eens meer, ga op een divan liggen en slaap om de tijd, de stilte, de verschrikkelijke angst ook, te verkorten, want te doden zijn ze niet.","Father, mother and Margot then leave me indifferent at times, I wander from one room to another, down the stairs and up again, feeling like a songbird, whose wings have been plucked out violently, and which flies against it in utter darkness. flies at the bars of his narrow cage.

I don't even answer anymore, lie down on a couch and sleep to shorten the time, the silence, the terrible fear too, because they can't be killed.","At times like these, Father, Mother and Margot don’t matter to me in the least. I wander from room to room, climb up and down the stairs and feel like a songbird whose wings have been ripped off and who keeps hurling itself against the bars of its dark cage. “Let me out, where there’s fresh air and laughter!” a voice within me cries. I don’t even bother to reply anymore, but lie down on the divan. Sleep makes the silence and the terrible fear go by more quickly, helps pass the time, since it’s impossible to kill it. Yours, Anne SATURDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1943 Dearest Kitty, Mother’s nerves are very much on edge, and that doesn’t bode well for me. Is it just a coincidence that Father and Mother never scold Margot and always blame me for everything? Last night, for example, Margot was reading a book with beautiful illustrations; she got up and put the book aside for later. I wasn’t doing anything, so I picked it up and began looking at the pictures. Margot came back, saw “her” book in my hands, knitted her brow and angrily demanded the book back. I wanted to look through it some more. Margot got madder by the minute, and Mother butted in: “ Margot was reading that book; give it back to her.” Father came in, and without even knowing what was going on, saw that Margot was being wronged and lashed out at me: “I’d like to see what you’d do if Margot was looking at one of your books!” I promptly gave in, put the book down and, according to them, left the room “in a huff.” I was neither huffy nor cross, but merely sad. It wasn’t right of Father to pass judgment without knowing what the issue was. I would have given the book to Margot myself, and a lot sooner, if Father and Mother hadn’t intervened and rushed to take Margot’s part, as if she were suffering some great injustice. Of course, Mother took Margot’s side; they always take each other’s sides. I’m so used to it that I’ve become completely indifferent to Mother ’s rebukes and Margot’s moodiness. I love them, but only because they’re Mother and Margot. I don’t give a darn about them as people. As far as I’m concerned, they can go jump in a lake. It’s different with Father. When I see him being partial to Margot, approving Margot’s every action, praising her, hugging her, I feel a gnawing ache inside, because I’m crazy about him. I model myself after Father, and there’s no one in the world I love more. He doesn’t realize that he treats Margot differently than he does me: Margot just happens to be the smartest, the kindest, the prettiest and the best. But I have a right to be taken seriously too. I’ve always been the clown and mischief maker of the family; I’ve always had to pay double for my sins: once with scoldings and then again with my own sense of despair. I’m no longer satisfied with the meaningless affection or the supposedly serious talks. I long for something from Father that he’s incapable of giving. I’m not jealous of Margot; I never have been. I’m not envious of her brains or her beauty. It’s just that I’d like to feel that Father really loves me, not because I’m his child, but because I’m me, Anne. I cling to Father because my contempt of Mother is growing daily and it’s only through him that I’m able to retain the last ounce of family feeling I have left. He doesn’t understand that I sometimes need to vent my feelings for Mother. He doesn’t want to talk about it, and he avoids any discussion involving Mother’s failings. And yet Mother, with all her shortcomings, is tougher for me to deal with. I don’t know how I should act. I can’t very well confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness, yet I can’t continue to take the blame for everything. I’m the opposite of Mother, so of course we clash. I don’t mean to judge her; I don’t have that right. I’m simply looking at her as a mother. She’s not a mother to me —I have to mother myself. I’ve cut myself adrift from them. I’m charting my own course, and we’ll see where it leads me. I have no choice, because I can picture what a mother and a wife should be and can’t seem to find anything of the sort in the woman I’m supposed to call “Mother.” I tell myself time and again to overlook Mother’s bad example. I only want to see her good points, and to look inside myself for what’s lacking in her. But it doesn’t work, and the worst part is that Father and Mother don’t realize their own inadequacies and how much I blame them for letting me down. Are there any parents who can make their children completely happy? Sometimes I think God is trying to test me, both now and in the future. I’ll have to become a good person on my own, without anyone to serve as a model or advise me, but it’ll make me stronger in the end. Who else but me is ever going to read these letters? Who else but me can I turn to for comfort? I’m frequently in need of consolation, I often feel weak, and more often than not, I fail to meet expectations. I know this, and every day I resolve to do better. They aren’t consistent in their treatment of me. One day they say that Anne’s a sensible girl and entitled to know everything, and the next that Anne’s a silly goose who doesn’t know a thing and yet imagines she ’s learned all she needs to know from books! I’m no longer the baby and spoiled little darling whose every deed can be laughed at. I have my own ideas, plans and ideals, but am unable to articulate them yet. Oh well. So much comes into my head at night when I’m alone, or during the day when I’m obliged to put up with people I can’t abide or who invariably misinterpret my intentions. That’s why I always wind up coming back to my diary—I start there and end there because Kitty’s always patient. I promise her that, despite everything, I’ll keep going, that I’ll find my own way and choke back my tears. I only wish I could see some results or, just once, receive encouragement from someone who loves me. Don’t condemn me, but think of me as a person who sometimes reaches the bursting point!","At such times Daddy, Mummy, and Margot leave me cold. I wander from one room to another, downstairs and up again, feeling like a songbird whose wings have been clipped and who is hurling himself in utter darkness against the bars of his cage. “Go outside, laugh, and take a breath of fresh air,” a voice cries within me, but I don’t even wish to respond any more; I go and lie on the divan and sleep, to make the time pass more quickly, and the stillness and the terrible fear, because there is no way of killing them."
"Om half negen stonden we op, Peter deed zijn gymschoenen aan om zachter te lopen bij de ronde door het huis en ik stond er bij. Hoe het zo plotseling kwam, ik weet het niet, maar voordat wij naar beneden gingen, gaf hij mij een zoen, tussen mijn haar, half op mijn linkerwang, half op mijn oor. Ik rende naar beneden, zonder omkijken en ben erg verlangend naar vandaag.","We got up at half past eight, Peter put on his sneakers to walk more softly on the round the house and I stood by.

I ran downstairs without looking back and am very longing for today.","At nine-thirty we stood up. Peter put on his tennis shoes so he wouldn’t make much noise on his nightly round of the building, and I was standing next to him.

I tore downstairs without looking back, and I long so much for today. Sunday morning, just before eleven.","We got up at half past eight. Peter put on his gym shoes, so that when he toured the house he wouldn’t make a noise, and I stood beside him.

"‘Er is een groot verschil, mevrouw Van Daan’, zei moeder, ‘tussen Margot en Peter, ten eerste is Margot een meisje, en meisjes zijn altijd rijper dan jongens, ten tweede heeft Margot al meer serieuze boeken gelezen en zoekt niet naar dingen die voor haar verboden zijn, ten derde is Margot veel ontwikkelder en verstandiger, wat haar vier H.B.S.- jaren meebrengen’. Mevrouw stemde daarmee in, maar vond het toch in principe verkeerd jonge kinderen boeken voor volwassenen te laten lezen.","'There is a big difference, Mrs Van Daan', said Mother, 'between Margot and Peter, firstly Margot is a girl, and girls are always more mature than boys, secondly Margot has already read more serious books and does not look for things which are forbidden to her, thirdly, Margot is much more educated and sensible, which brings her four H.B.S. years'. Mrs. agreed, but thought it was in principle wrong to let young children read books for adults.","“You see, Mrs. van Daan,” Mother said, “there’s a big difference between Margot and Peter. To begin with, Margot’s a girl, and girls are always more mature than boys. Second, she’s already read many serious books and doesn’t go looking for those which are no longer forbidden. Third, Margot’s much more sensible and intellectually advanced, as a result of her four years at an excellent school.” Mrs. van Daan agreed with her, but felt it was wrong as a matter of principle to let youngsters read books written for adults.","“There  is  a  great  difference,  Mrs.  van  Daan,”  said Mummy, “between Margot and Peter. In the first place, Margot is a girl and girls are always more grown-up than boys; secondly, Margot has read quite a lot of serious books, and does not go in search of things that are forbidden to her; thirdly, Margot is far more developed and intelligent, shown by the fact of her being in the fourth form at school.” Mrs.  van  Daan  agreed,  but  still  thought   it  was  wrong in principle to let children read books which were written for grown-ups."

I mustn’t carry my indifference and contempt for her too far. In spite of everything, I should try once again to be friendly and keep my remarks to myself!","I had a little ticking off yesterday evening from Mummy, which I certainly deserved.

Het is natuurlijk wel waar, dat mevrouw Van Daan allesbehalve een fijn mens is, maar toch denk ik dat, als moeder niet óók moeilijk te hanteren werd bij elk puntig gesprek, de helft van alle ruzies vermeden had kunnen worden.","How did I get so changed? Yeah, you see, I suddenly thought that if Mother were different, a real Mom, our relationship would have been very, very different. It is of course true that Mrs. Van Daan is anything but a nice person, but I think that if Mother had not also become difficult to handle with every pointed conversation, half of all quarrels could have been avoided.","What’s brought on such a radical change? Well, you see, I suddenly realized that if Mother had been different, if she’d been a real mom, our relationship would have been very, very different. Mrs. van Daan is by no means a wonderful person, yet half the arguments could have been avoided if Mother hadn’t been so hard to deal with every time they got onto a tricky subject.","How can I have changed so much? Yes, you see it suddenly struck me that if Mummy had been different, a real Mumsie, the relationship might have been quite, quite different. It’s true that Mrs. van Daan is by no means a nice person, but still I do think that half the quarrels could be avoided if it weren’t for the fact that when the conversation gets tricky Mummy is a bit diﬃcult too."

Margot, on the other hand, is much more shy than I am and not at all embarrassed.","I feel that too, which probably accounts for my recent embarrassment over Margot, Mother and Father. On the other hand, Margot is a lot shyer than I am, and yet she’s not in the least embarrassed.","I experience that too, and that is why I get the feeling lately of being embarrassed about Margot, Mummy, and Daddy. Funnily enough, Margot, who is much more shy than I am, isn’t at all embarrassed."
"De stemming in Nederland is vanuit ons Achterfort niet te peilen. Ongetwijfeld zijn de mensen blij, dat het nietsdoende (!) Engeland eindelijk ook zelf eens de handen uit de mouwen steekt. Alle Nederlanders die nu nog op de Engelsen neerkijken, Engeland en de oude-heren-regering beschimpen, Engelsen laf noemen, maar toch de Duitsers haten, moeten eens net zo opgeschud worden als dat met een kussen gebeurt. Misschien leggen zich die verwarde hersenen dan in een wat betere plooi.","The mood in the Netherlands cannot be gauged from our Achterfort. Undoubtedly people are happy that idle (!) England is finally rolling up its sleeves. All the Dutch who still look down on the English, who taunt England and the old gentlemen's government, who call the English cowards, but who still hate the Germans, should be shaken up just as much as they do with a pillow. Perhaps that confused brain will settle in a little better.","From our position here in Fort Annex, it’s difficult to gauge the mood of the Dutch. No doubt many people are glad the idle (!) British have finally rolled up their sleeves and gotten down to work. Those who keep claiming they don’t want to be occupied by the British don’t realize how unfair they’re being. Their line of reasoning boils down to this: England must fight, struggle and sacrifice its sons to liberate Holland and the other occupied countries. After that the British shouldn’t remain in Holland: they should offer their most abject apologies to all the occupied countries, restore the Dutch East Indies to its rightful owner and then return, weakened and impoverished, to England. What a bunch of idiots. And yet, as I’ve already said, many Dutch people can be counted among their ranks. What would have become of Holland and its neighbors if England had signed a peace treaty with Germany, as it’s had ample opportunity to do?","It’s diﬃcult for us to judge from our secret spot how people outside have reacted to the news. Undoubtedly people are pleased that the idle English have rolled up their sleeves and are doing something at last. Any Dutch people who still look down on the English, scoff at England and her government of old gentlemen, call the English cowards, and yet hate the Germans deserve a good shaking.

Still, in spite of all the unpleasantness and bother, I’m glad it hasn’t failed me any longer."
"Vader zei eens tegen me, toen we over sexualiteit spraken, dat ik de begeerte toch nog niet kon begrijpen; ik wist altijd dat ik het wel begreep en nu begrijp ik het helemaal. Niets is me nu zo dierbaar als hij, mijn Petel!","Father once said to me, when we talked about sexuality, that I still could not understand desire; I always knew I understood and now I completely understand. Nothing is more dear to me now than he, my Petel!","This morning I imagined I was in the front attic with Petel, sitting on the floor by the windows, and after talking for a while, we both began to cry. Moments later I felt his mouth and his wonderful cheek! Oh, Petel, come to me.","Once, when we spoke about sex. Daddy told me that I couldn’t possibly understand the longing yet; I always knew that I did understand it and now I understand it fully. Nothing is so beloved to me now as he, my Peter."

"Ondanks alles was ik in 1942 ook niet onverdeeld gelukkig; ik voelde me vaak verlaten, maar omdat ik van 's morgens tot 's avonds in de weer was, dacht ik niet na en maakte pret zoveel ik kon.

"Ook Elli is stil; haar jongen moet naar Duitsland. Ze is bang, dat de vliegers die over onze huizen vliegen, hun bommenlast van vaak wel een millioen kilo's op Dirks hoofd laten vallen. Grapjes van ‘een millioen zal hij wel niet krijgen’ en ‘één bom is al genoeg’ vind ik hier niet erg op zijn plaats. Dirk is heus niet de enige die moet gaan, elke dag rijden er volle treinen met jongens weg. Onderweg, als ze op een klein stationnetje stoppen, stappen ze wel eens stiekem uit en proberen onder te duiken; dat lukt misschien een klein percentage.","Elli is also quiet; her boy has to go to Germany. She is afraid that the kites that fly over our houses will drop their bomb load of often a million kilos on Dirk's head.

Jokes like “Oh, don’t worry , they can’t all fall on him” or “One bomb is all it takes” are hardly appropriate in this situation. Bertus is not the only one being forced to work in Germany. Trainloads of young men depart daily. Some of them try to sneak off the train when it stops at a small station, but only a few manage to escape unnoticed and find a place to hide.","Bep too is very quiet: her boy friend has got to go to Germany. She is afraid that the airmen who uy over our homes will drop their bombs, often weighing a million kilos, on Dirk’s head.

"Op dit punt aangekomen werd ik wakker, terwijl ik nog zijn wang tegen de mijne aanvoelde en zijn bruine ogen diep in mijn hart voelde kijken, zo diep dat hij daarin gelezen had hoezeer ik van hem gehouden had en hoeveel ik nog van hem hield.

"Om wat houdbaars in huis te hebben, buiten onze 150 blikken groenten, hebben we 270 pond peulvruchten gekocht. Dat is niet alles voor ons alleen, ook met kantoor is rekening gehouden. De peulvruchten hingen in zakken in ons gangetje (binnen de schuildeur), aan haken. Door het zware gewicht zijn een paar naden van de zakken opengesprongen. We besloten dus onze wintervoorraad maar liever op zolder te zetten en vertrouwden Peter het hijswerkje toe.","In order to have some shelf life in the house, beyond our 150 cans of vegetables, we bought 270 pounds of legumes. That is not all for us alone, the office has also been taken into account. The pulses hung in bags in our hallway (inside the shelter door), on hooks. Due to the heavy weight, a few seams of the bags have popped open. So we decided to put our winter stock in the attic and entrusted Peter with the lifting work.","To provide ourselves with a source of nutrition that will keep, aside from the hundred cans of food we’ve stored here, we bought three hundred pounds of beans. Not just for us, but for the office staff as well. We’d hung the sacks of beans on hooks in the hallway, just inside our secret entrance, but a few seams split under the weight. So we decided to move them to the attic, and Peter was entrusted with the heavy lifting.","In order to have something in the house that will keep, apart from our 150 tins of vegetables, we have bought 270 pounds of dried peas and beans. They are not all for us, some are for the oﬃce people. They are in sacks which hang on hooks in our little passage (inside the hidden door). Owing to the weight of the contents, a few stitches in the sacks burst open. So we decided it would be better to put our winter store in the attic and Peter was given the job of dragging it all up there."
"Door de gordijnen kan men niet naar binnen kijken, maar hard gepraat, slaande deuren, ik kreeg de bibberatie van opwinding. Ja, maar zijn we heus nog ondergedoken, ging het door mij heen, zo'n gevoel moet je hebben, als je je weer aan de wereld mag vertonen. De pan was vol, gauw naar boven. In onze keuken aan tafel stond de rest van de familie en plukte, het moest tenminste plukken verbeelden; er ging meer in de monden dan in de emmers. Nog een emmer was weldra nodig, Peter ging weer naar de keuken beneden - er werd twee keer gebeld; de emmer bleef staan, Peter holde naar boven, de kastdeur op slot! We trappelden van ongeduld, de kraan moest dicht blijven en al wachtten de half gewassen aardbeien nog zo op hun bad, de duikregel: ‘Iemand in huis, alle kranen dicht voor het lawaai dat de watertoevoer maakt’, bleef gehandhaafd.","Through the curtains one cannot see in, but loud talking, slamming doors, I got the shiver of excitement. Yes, but are we really still in hiding, it crossed my mind, you must have that feeling when you are allowed to show yourself to the world again. The pan was full, quickly upstairs. In our kitchen the rest of the family stood at the table and picked, at least it had to represent picking; more went into the mouths than into the buckets. Another bucket was soon needed, Peter went down to the kitchen again - the bell rang twice; the bucket stopped, Peter ran upstairs, the cupboard door locked! We kicked with impatience, the tap had to be turned off and even though the half-washed strawberries were still waiting for their bath, the diving rule: 'Someone in the house, shut all taps for the noise of the water supply', was maintained.","Curtains and windows open, loud voices, banging doors—I was trembling with excitement. I kept thinking, “Are we really in hiding?” This must be how it feels when you can finally go out into the world again. The pan was full, so I dashed upstairs, where the rest of the family was hulling strawberries around the kitchen table. At least that’s what they were supposed to be doing, but more was going into their mouths than into the buckets. They were bound to need another bucket soon. Peter went back downstairs, but then the doorbell rang twice. Leaving the bucket where it was, Peter raced upstairs and shut the bookcase behind him. We sat kicking our heels impatiently; the strawberries were waiting to be rinsed, but we stuck to the house rule: “No running water when strangers are downstairs—they might hear the drains.”","People can’t see in from outside because of the net curtains, but, even so, the loud voices and banging doors positively gave me the jitters. Are we really supposed to be in hiding? That’s what uashed through my mind, and it gives one a very queer feeling to be able to appear in the world again. The pan was full, and I dashed upstairs again. The rest of the family was seated round our table in the kitchen busy stalk-picking— at least that’s what they were supposed to be doing; more went into mouths than into buckets. Another bucket would soon be required. Peter went to the downstairs kitchen again— the bell rang twice; the bucket stayed where it was, Peter tore upstairs, locked the cupboard door! We were kicking our heels impatiently, couldn’t turn on a tap, even though the strawberries were only half washed, the rule is: If strangers are in the house, use no water, because of the noise."

"Dit laatste is zeker niet prettig, vooral als het een lid van de familie met name Dussel betreft. Eerst hoor ik een geluidje alsof een vis naar lucht hapt, dit herhaalt zich een stuk of tien keer, dan worden met veel omhaal de lippen bevochtigd, afgewisseld door kleine smakgeluidjes, gevolgd door een langdurig heen en weer draaien in bed en verschikken van kussens. Vijf minuten volkomen rust en dan herhaalt zich deze afwikkeling van gebeurtenissen nog wel drie keer, waarna de dr zich zeker weer voor een poosje in slaap gesust heeft.","The latter is certainly not pleasant, especially if it concerns a member of the family especially Dussel. First I hear a sound as if a fish is gasping for air, this is repeated about ten times, then the lips are moistened with great fuss, alternating with small smacking sounds, followed by a prolonged to and fro in bed and changing pillows. Five minutes of complete rest and then this turn of events repeats itself three more times, after which the dr has surely lulled himself back to sleep for a while.","This is no fun, especially when it concerns a member of the family named Dr. Dussel.

"‘Himmelhoch jauchzend und zum Tode betrübt’ is hier zeker wel van toepassing. ‘Himmelhoch jauchzend’ ben ik, als ik er aan denk hoe goed we het hier hebben en mij vergelijk met andere Joodse kinderen en ‘zum Tode betrübt’ overvalt me, wanneer bijvoorbeeld, zoals vandaag, mevrouw Koophuis hier geweest is en vertelt van haar dochter Corry's hockeyclub, kanovaarten, toneelopvoeringen en vrienden. Ik geloof niet, dat ik jaloers op Corry ben, maar wel krijg ik dan zo'n sterk verlangen om ook eens flink pret te maken en te lachen tot ik er buikpijn van krijg. Vooral nu in de winter met al die vrije Kerst- en Nieuwjaarsdagen, dan zitten we hier zo als uitgestotenen en toch mag ik deze woorden eigenlijk niet opschrijven, omdat ik dan ondankbaar lijk en het is ook wel overdreven. Maar wat je ook van me mag denken, ik kan niet alles voor mezelf bewaren en haal dan nog maar mijn beginwoorden aan: ‘Papier is geduldig’.","'Himmelhoch jauchzend und zum Tode betrübt' certainly applies here. I am 'Himmelhoch jauchzend' when I think about how good we have it here and when I compare myself with other Jewish children and 'zum Tode betrübt' overtakes me, when, for example, like today, Mrs. Koophuis has been here and tells about her daughter. Corry's hockey club, canoe trips, stage performances and friends. I don't think I'm jealous of Corry, but I do get such a strong desire to have a good time and laugh until it gives me a stomachache. Especially now in the winter with all those free Christmas and New Years days, then we sit here like outcasts and yet I can't really write these words, because then I seem ungrateful and it is also exaggerated. But whatever you may think of me, I can't keep everything to myself, so I'll just quote my opening words: ""Paper is patient.""","“Himmelhoch jauchzend, zu Tode betrübt”11 certainly applies to me. I’m “on top of the world” when I think of how fortunate we are and compare myself to other Jewish children, and “in the depths of despair” when, for example, Mrs. Kleiman comes by and talks about Jopie’s hockey club, canoe trips, school plays and afternoon teas with friends. I don’t think I’m jealous of Jopie, but I long to have a really good time for once and to laugh so hard it hurts. We’re stuck in this house like lepers, especially during winter and the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. Actually, I shouldn’t even be writing this, since it makes me seem so ungrateful, but I can’t keep everything to myself, so I’ll repeat what I said at the beginning: “Paper is more patient than people.”","‘Himmelhoch jauchzend Tode  betrubt’ certainly fits here. I am 'on top of the world’ if I only think how lucky we are here compared with other Jewish children, and ‘in the depths of despair’ comes over me when, as happened today, for example, Mrs. Kleiman comes and tells us about her daughter Cony’s hockey club, canoe trips, theatrical performances, and friends. I don’t think I’m jealous of Cony, but I couldn’t help feeling a great longing to have lots of fun myself for once, and to laugh until my tummy ached. Especially at this time of the year with all the holidays for Christmas and the New Year, and we are stuck here like outcasts. Still, I really ought not to write this, because it seems ungrateful and I’ve certainly been exaggerating. But still, whatever you think of me, I can’t keep everything to myself, so I’ll remind you of my opening words, Paper is patient."

I had come out of my room and wanted to go and sit at the table to write, when I was roughly pushed on one side and had to make room for Margot and Daddy, who wanted to practice their 'Latin.’ The fountain pen remained on the table unused while, with a sigh, its owner contented herself with a tiny little corner of the table and started rubbing beans. ' Bean rubbing’ is making mouldy beans decent again."
"Het benauwt me ook meer dan ik zeggen kan, dat we nooit naar buiten mogen en ik ben erg bang, dat we ontdekt worden en dan de kogel krijgen. Dat is natuurlijk een minder prettig vooruitzicht.",It also oppresses me more than I can say that we are never allowed to go outside and I am very afraid that we will be discovered and then get the bullet. That is of course a less pleasant prospect.,"Of course, we can’t ever look out the window or go outside. And we have to be quiet so the people downstairs can’t hear us. Yesterday we had our hands full. We had to pit two crates of cherries for Mr. Kugler to can. We’re going to use the empty crates to make bookshelves. Someone’s calling me. Yours, Anne COMMENT ADDED BY ANNE ON SEPTEMBER 28, 1942: Not being able to go outside upsets me more than I can say, and I’m terrified our hiding place will be discovered and that we’ll be shot. That, of course, is a fairly dismal prospect.","I can’t tell you how oppressive it is never to be able to go outdoors, also I’m very afraid that we shall be discovered and be shot. That is not exactly a pleasant prospect."

"Ten eerste heeft onze opvrolijker mijnheer Koophuis gisteren een erge maagbloeding gehad en moet op zijn minst drie weken het bed houden. Ten tweede: Elli griep. Ten derde gaat mijnheer Vossen volgende week naar het ziekenhuis. Hij heeft waarschijnlijk een maagzweer en moet daaraan geopereerd worden. En ten vierde waren belangrijke zakenbesprekingen op komst, en alle voornaamste punten had vader met mijnheer Koophuis in details besproken, mijnheer Kraler kan in de gauwigheid niet zo goed ingelicht worden.","First of all, our cheery Mr Koophuis had a bad stomach bleeding yesterday and has to be in bed for at least three weeks. Second: Elli flu. Thirdly, Mr. Vossen is going to the hospital next week. He probably has a stomach ulcer and needs surgery.

I should tell you that his stomach has been bothering him quite a bit, and there’s no cure. Second, Bep has the flu. Third, Mr. Voskuijl has to go to the hospital next week. He probably has an ulcer and will have to undergo surgery. Fourth, the managers of Pomosin Industries came from Frankfurt to discuss the new Opekta deliveries. Father had gone over the important points with Mr. Kleiman, and there wasn’t enough time to give Mr. Kugler a thorough briefing.","To begin with, Mr. Kleiman, the one who always cheers us up, has had haemorrhage of the stomach and has got to stay in bed for at least three weeks. Secondly, Bep has uu. Thirdly, Mr. Vossen is going to the hospital next week. He has probably got an abdominal ulcer. And fourthly, some important business conferences, the main points of which Daddy had discussed in detail with Mr. Kleiman, were due to be held, but now there isn’t time to explain everything thoroughly to Mr. Kugler."
"Ik moest eigenlijk ontzettend lachen, moeder ook en Peter zat zich eveneens te verbijten. O die domme volwassenen, laat ze zelf liever beginnen te leren, vóór ze zoveel op de kinderen hebben aan te merken!","I actually had to laugh a lot, mother too and Peter was also biting himself. O those stupid adults, let them rather begin to learn themselves, before they find fault with the children so much!","Actually, I couldn’t help giggling. Mother couldn’t either, and even Peter was biting his lips to keep from laughing. Oh, those stupid grown-ups. They need to learn a few things first before they start making so many remarks about the younger generation! Since Friday we’ve been keeping the windows open again at night. Yours, Anne M. Frank What Our Annex Family Is Interested In (A Systematic Survey of Courses and Reading Matter) Mr. van Daan.

"De promotie Vrijdag in de Joodse Schouwburg is naar wens verlopen. Mijn rapport is helemaal niet zo slecht, ik heb één onvoldoende, een vijf voor algebra, twee zessen, verder allemaal zevens en twee achten. Thuis waren ze wel blij, maar mijn ouders zijn in cijferaangelegenheden heel anders dan andere ouders. Ze trekken zich nooit iets van goede of slechte rapporten aan en letten er alleen op of ik gezond ben, niet te brutaal en pret heb; als deze dingen in orde zijn, komt al het andere wel vanzelf. Ik ben het tegendeel, ik wil geen slechte leerling zijn, ik ben voorwaardelijk op het Lyceum aangenomen, omdat ik eigenlijk nog in de zevende klas van de 6de Montessorischool had moeten blijven. Maar toen alle Joodse kinderen naar Joodse scholen moesten, nam de directeur mij en Lies, na wat heen en weer gepraat, voorwaardelijk op. En ik wil zijn vertrouwen niet beschamen. Mijn zuster Margot heeft ook haar rapport, schitterend zoals gewoonlijk. Als cum laude bij ons zou bestaan, was ze zeker met lof overgegaan, zo'n knappe bol!","The Friday promotion in the Jewish Theater went according to plan. My report is not that bad at all, I have one fail, a five for algebra, two sixes, all sevens and two eights. They were happy at home, but my parents are very different from other parents when it comes to grades. They never give a damn about good or bad reports and only care if I'm healthy, not too bold and having fun; if these things are in order, everything else will come naturally. I'm the opposite, I don't want to be a bad student, I was admitted to the Lyceum on probation, because I should have stayed in the seventh grade of the 6th Montessori school. But when all Jewish children had to go to Jewish schools, the director admitted me and Lies on a conditional basis, after talking back and forth. And I don't want to betray his trust. My sister Margot also has her report card, brilliant as usual. If cum laude existed with us, she would certainly have passed with praise, such a handsome ball!","The graduation ceremony in the Jewish Theater on Friday went as expected. My report card wasn’t too bad. I got one D, a C—in algebra and all the rest B’s, except for two B+’s and two B— ’s. My parents are pleased, but they’re not like other parents when it comes to grades. They never worry about report cards, good or bad. As long as I’m healthy and happy and don’t talk back too much, they’re satisfied. If these three things are all right, everything else will take care of itself. I’m just the opposite. I don’t want to be a poor student. I was accepted to the Jewish Lyceum on a conditional basis. I was supposed to stay in the seventh grade at the Montessori School, but when Jewish children were required to go to Jewish schools, Mr. Elte finally agreed, after a great deal of persuasion, to accept Lies Goslar and me. Lies also passed this year, though she has to repeat her geometry exam. Poor Lies. It isn’t easy for her to study at home; her baby sister, a spoiled little two-year-old, plays in her room all day. If Gabi doesn’t get her way, she starts screaming, and if Lies doesn’t look after her, Mrs. Goslar starts screaming. So Lies has a hard time doing her homework, and as long as that’s the case, the tutoring she’s been getting won’t help much. The Goslar household is really a sight. Mrs. Goslar’s parents live next door, but eat with the family. Then there’s a hired girl, the baby, the always absentminded and absent Mr. Goslar and the always nervous and irritable Mrs. Goslar, who’s expecting another baby. Lies, who’s all thumbs, gets lost in the mayhem. My sister Margot has also gotten her report card. Brilliant, as usual. If we had such a thing as “cum laude,” she would have passed with honors, she’s so smart.","Our examination results were announced in the Jewish Theatre last Friday. I couldn’t have hoped for more. My report is not at all bad, I had one vix satis, a five for algebra, two sixes, and the rest were all sevens or eights. They were certainly pleased at home, although over the question of marks my parents are quite different from most. They don’t care a bit whether my reports are good or bad as long as I’m well and happy, and not too cheeky, then the rest will come by itself. I am just the opposite. I don’t want to be a bad pupil; I should really have stayed in the seventh form in the Montessori School, but was accepted for the Jewish Secondary. When all the Jewish children had to go to Jewish schools, the headmaster took Hanneli and me conditionally after a bit of persuasion. He relied on us to do our best and I don’t want to let him down. My sister Margot has her report too, brilliant as usual. She would move up with cum laude if that existed at school, she is so brainy."

You and Peter will both win only in association with each other.""",So there’s no need for you to reproach yourself because you think you’re taking something I was entitled to; nothing could be further from the truth.

"Gisteravond hadden we kortsluiting, bovendien paften ze onophoudelijk. Ik heb mijn angst voor alles wat schieten of vliegers is nog niet afgeleerd en lig haast elke nacht bij vader in bed, om daar troost te zoeken. Dat kan nu wel erg kinderachtig zijn, maar je moest het eens meemaken. Je kunt je eigen woorden niet meer verstaan, zo bulderen de kanonnen. Mevrouw, de fataliste, begon haast te huilen en sprak met een heel benepen stemmetje: ‘O, het is zo onaangenaam, o ze schieten zo hard’, dat wil zeggen: ‘Ik ben zo bang’.","Last night we had a short circuit, moreover they puffed incessantly. I have not yet learned my fear of all things shooting or flying kites and I lie in bed with father almost every night, seeking comfort there. That can be very childish now, but you had to experience it once. You can no longer understand your own words, so roar the cannons. Madame, the fatalist, almost wept, and spoke in a very small voice: ""Oh, it is so unpleasant, oh they shoot so hard,"" that is, ""I am so afraid.""","We had a short circuit last night, and besides that, the guns were booming away until dawn. I still haven’t gotten over my fear of planes and shooting, and I crawl into Father’s bed nearly every night for comfort. I know it sounds childish, but wait till it happens to you! The ack-ack guns make so much noise you can’t hear your own voice. Mrs. Beaverbrook, the fatalist, practically burst into tears and said in a timid little voice, “ Oh, it’s so awful. Oh, the guns are so loud!”—which is another way of saying “I’m so scared.”","We had a short circuit last evening, and on top of that   the guns kept banging away all the time. I still haven’t got over my fear of everything connected with shooting and planes, and I creep into Daddy’s bed nearly every night for comfort. I know it’s very childish but you don’t know what it is like. The A.A. guns roar so loudly that you can’t hear yourself speak. Mrs. van Daan, the fatalist, was nearly crying, and said in a very timid little voice, “Oh, it is so unpleasant! Oh, they are shooting so hard,” by which she really means “I’m so frightened.”"
"Lieve Kitty,","Dear kitty,","Dearest Kitty, Bep’s engaged! The news isn’t much of a surprise, though none of us are particularly pleased. Bertus may be a nice, steady, athletic young man, but Bep doesn’t love him, and to me that’s enough reason to advise her against marrying him. Bep’s trying to get ahead in the world, and Bertus is pulling her back ; he’s a laborer, without any interests or any desire to make something of himself, and I don’t think that’ll make Bep happy. I can understand Bep’s wanting to put an end to her indecision; four weeks ago she decided to write him off, but then she felt even worse. So she wrote him a letter, and now she’s engaged.","Dear Kitty,"

This moment is indescribable. “Now we’re done for,” I said, and I had visions of all fifteen of us being dragged away by the Gestapo that very night. More rattling at the bookcase, twice. Then we heard a can fall, and the footsteps receded. We were out of danger, so far! A shiver went though everyone’s body, I heard several sets of teeth chattering, no one said a word.","It turned half past ten, then eleven, but not a sound; Daddy and van Daan joined us one by one. Then at a quarter past eleven, a bustle and noise downstairs. Everyone’s breath was audible, otherwise no one moved. Footsteps in the house, in the private oﬃce, kitchen, then... on our staircase. No one breathed audibly now, footsteps on our staircase, then a rattling of the swinging cupboard. This moment is indescribable. “Now we are lost!” I said, and could see us all being taken away by the Gestapo that very night. Twice they rattled at the cupboard, then there was nothing and the footsteps withdrew, we were saved so far. A shiver seemed to pass through us all, I heard someone’s teeth chattering, no one said a word."

Frank FRIDAY, APRIL 21, 1944 My dearest Kitty, I stayed in bed yesterday with a sore throat, but since I was already bored the very first afternoon and didn’t have a fever, I got up today. My sore throat has nearly “verschwunden.”23 Yesterday, as you’ve probably already discovered, was our Führer’s fifty-fifth birthday. Today is the eighteenth birthday of Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth of York. The BBC reported that she hasn’t yet been declared of age, though royal children usually are. We’ve been wondering which prince they’ll marry this beauty off to, but can’t think of a suitable candidate; perhaps her sister, Princess Margaret Rose, can have Crown Prince Baudouin of Belgium! Here we’ve been going from one disaster to the next. No sooner have the outside doors been reinforced than van Maaren rears his head again. In all likelihood he’s the one who stole the potato flour, and now he’s trying to pin the blame on Bep. Not surprisingly, the Annex is once again in an uproar. Bep is beside herself with rage. Perhaps Mr. Kugler will finally have this shady character tailed. The appraiser from Beethovenstraat was here this morning. He offered us 400 guilders for our chest; in our opinion, the other estimates are also too low. I want to ask the magazine The Prince if they’ll take one of my fairy tales, under a pseudonym, of course. But up to now all my fairy tales have been too long, so I don’t think I have much of a chance. Until the next time, darling. Yours, Anne M. Frank TUESDAY, APRIL 25, 1944 Dearest Kitty, For the last ten days Dussel hasn’t been on speaking terms with Mr. van Daan, and all because of the new security measures since the break-in. One of these was that he’s no longer allowed to go downstairs in the evenings. Peter and Mr. van Daan make the last round every night at nine-thirty, and after that no one may go downstairs. We can’t flush the toilet anymore after eight at night or after eight in the morning. The windows may be opened only in the morning when the lights go on in Mr. Kugler’s office, and they can no longer be propped open with a stick at night. This last measure is the reason for Dussel’s sulking. He claims that Mr. van Daan bawled him out, but he has only himself to blame. He says he’d rather live without food than without air, and that they simply must figure out a way to keep the windows open. “I’ll have to speak to Mr. Kugler about this,” he said to me. I replied that we never discussed matters of this sort with Mr. Kugler, only within the group. “Everything’s always happening behind my back. I’ll have to talk to your father about that.” He’s also not allowed to sit in Mr. Kugler’s office anymore on Saturday afternoons or Sundays, because the manager of Keg’s might hear him if he happens to be next door. Dussel promptly went and sat there anyway. Mr. van Daan was furious, and Father went downstairs to talk to Dussel, who came up with some flimsy excuse, but even Father didn’t fall for it this time. Now Father’s keeping his dealings with Dussel to a minimum because Dussel insulted him. Not one of us knows what he said, but it must have been pretty awful. And to think that that miserable man has his birthday next week. How can you celebrate your birthday when you’ve got the sulks , how can you accept gifts from people you won’t even talk to? Mr. Voskuijl is going downhill rapidly. For more than ten days he’s had a temperature of almost a hundred and four. The doctor said his condition is hopeless; they think the cancer has spread to his lungs. The poor man, we’d so like to help him, but only God can help him now! I’ve written an amusing story called “Blurry the Explorer,” which was a big hit with my three listeners. I still have a bad cold and have passed it on to Margot, as well as Mother and Father. If only Peter doesn’t get it. He insisted on a kiss, and called me his El Dorado. You can’t call a person that, silly boy! But he’s sweet anyway!","Is there anything more beautiful in the world than to sit before an open window and enjoy nature, to listen to the birds singing, feel the sun on your cheeks and have a darling boy in your arms? It is so soothing and peaceful to feel his arms around me, to know that he is close by and yet to remain silent; how can this tranquillity be bad, if it feels so wonderful. Oh, never to be disturbed again, not even by Mouschi."

"Moeder, Margot en ik zijn weer de beste maatjes, dat is toch eigenlijk veel prettiger. Gisteravond lagen Margot en ik samen in mijn bed, het was onnoemelijk klein, maar juist grappig. Ze vroeg of ze eens mijn dagboek mocht lezen. Ik zei: ‘Sommige stukken wel’, en toen vroeg ik naar het hare, dat mocht ik dan ook lezen. Toen kwamen we zo op de toekomst. Ik vroeg haar wat ze wilde worden, maar dat wil ze niet zeggen en ze maakt er een groot geheim van. Ik heb zoiets opgevangen van onderwijs; ik weet niet of het goed is, maar ik vermoed van wel. Eigenlijk mag ik niet zo nieuwsgierig zijn!","Mother, Margot and I are best buddies again, which is actually much nicer. Last night Margot and I lay in my bed together, it was unbelievably small, but funny. She asked if she could read my diary. I said: 'Some pieces do', and then I asked about hers, so I could read that too. Then we came to the future. I asked her what she wanted to be, but she won't say and makes a big secret of it. I've heard something like that from education; I don't know if it's right, but I suspect it is. Actually, I shouldn't be so curious!","Moreover, I’ve read a lot of Körner plays. I like the way he writes. For example, Hedwig, The Cousin from Bremen, The Governess, The Green Domino, etc. Mother, Margot and I are once again the best of buddies. It’s actually a lot nicer that way. Last night Margot and I were lying side by side in my bed. It was incredibly cramped, but that’s what made it fun. She asked if she could read my diary once in a while. “Parts of it,” I said, and asked about hers. She gave me permission to read her diary as well. The conversation turned to the future, and I asked what she wanted to be when she was older. But she wouldn’t say and was quite mysterious about it. I gathered it had something to do with teaching; of course, I’m not absolutely sure, but I suspect it’s something along those lines. I really shouldn’t be so nosy.","Mummy, Margot, and I are as thick as thieves again. Its really much better. Margot and I got in the same bed together last evening; it was a frightful squash, but that was just the fun of it. She asked if she  could read my diary. I said, 'Yes—at least, bits of it’ and then I asked if I could read hers and she said, 'Yes.’ Then we got on to the subject of the future. I asked her what she wanted to be. But she wouldn’t say and made a great secret of it. I gathered something about teaching, I’m not sure if I’m right, but I think so. Really, I shouldn’t be so curious!"

"Donderdag, 3 Februari 1944","Thursday, February 3, 1944","SUNDAY, JANUARY 30, 1944 My dearest Kit, Another Sunday has rolled around; I don’t mind them as much as I did in the beginning, but they’re boring enough. I still haven’t gone to the warehouse yet, but maybe sometime soon. Last night I went downstairs in the dark, all by myself, after having been there with Father a few nights before. I stood at the top of the stairs while German planes flew back and forth, and I knew I was on my own, that I couldn’t count on others for support. My fear vanished. I looked up at the sky and trusted in God. I have an intense need to be alone. Father has noticed I’m not my usual self, but I can’t tell him what’s bothering me.

Saturday there was a big drama, the likes of which have never been seen here before. It started with a discussion of van Maaren and ended in a general argument and tears. Dussel complained to Mother that he was being treated like a leper, that no one was friendly to him and that, after all, he hadn’t done anything to deserve it. This was followed by a lot of sweet talk, which luckily Mother didn’t fall for this time. She told him we were disappointed in him and that, on more than one occasion, he’d been a source of great annoyance. Dussel promised her the moon, but, as usual, we haven’t seen so much as a beam.","Bep had a fit of nerves this week; she had been sent out so often, time and again she had been asked to go and fetch something quickly, which meant yet another errand or made her feel that she had done something wrong. If you just think that she still has to finish her oﬃce work downstairs, that Kleiman is ill, Miep at home with a cold, and that she herself has a sprained ankle, love worries, and a grumbling father, then its no wonder she’s at her wit ’s end. We comforted her and said that if she puts her foot down once or twice and says she has no time, then the shopping lists will automatically get shorter."

"Verleden week hadden we een kleine interruptie in ons zo eentonige leven: het kwam door een boek over vrouwen, - en Peter. Je moet namelijk weten, dat Margot en Peter haast alle boeken, die mijnheer Koophuis ons leent, mogen lezen, maar dit bijzondere boek over een vrouwenonderwerp hielden de volwassenen toch maar liever in eigen handen. Dat prikkelde dadelijk de nieuwsgierigheid van Peter. Wat zou er wel voor verbodens in dat boek staan? Stiekem pakte hij het van zijn moeder weg, terwijl zij beneden aan het praten was, en ging met zijn buit naar de vliering. Dat ging een paar dagen goed. Mevrouw Van Daan wist al lang wat hij deed, maar verklapte niets, totdat mijnheer er achter kwam. Die werd kwaad, pakte het boek af en dacht, dat daarmee de zaak afgelopen zou zijn. Hij had echter buiten de nieuwsgierigheid van zijn zoon gerekend, die door het kordate optreden van papa geenszins van zijn stuk gebracht was.","Last week we had a little interruption in our so monotonous life: it was because of a book about women, - and Peter. You should know that Margot and Peter are allowed to read almost all the books that Mr Koophuis lends us, but adults preferred to keep this special book on a women's subject in their own hands. That immediately piqued Peter's curiosity. What would be forbidden in that book? Secretly he took it away from his mother while she was talking downstairs, and went to the loft with his loot. That went well for a few days. Mrs. Van Daan had known what he was doing for a long time, but didn't reveal anything until Mr. found out. He became angry, took the book away and thought that that would be the end of the matter. However, he had not counted on his son's curiosity, who was by no means shaken by Papa's resolute conduct.","Last week there was a brief interruption in our monotonous routine. This was provided by Peter—and a book about women. I should explain that Margot and Peter are allowed to read nearly all the books Mr. Kleiman lends us. But the adults preferred to keep this special book to themselves. This immediately piqued Peter’s curiosity. What forbidden fruit did it contain? He snuck off with it when his mother was downstairs talking, and took himself and his booty to the loft. For two days all was well. Mrs. van Daan knew what he was up to, but kept mum until Mr. van Daan found out about it. He threw a fit, took the book away and assumed that would be the end of the business. However, he’d neglected to take his son’s curiosity into account.","The previous week saw little interruption in our monotonous life, it was over a book about women—and Peter. First I must tell you that Margot and Peter are allowed to read nearly all the books that Mr. Kleiman lends us, but the grown-ups held back this particular book on the subject of women. Peter’s curiosity was aroused at once. What was it the two of them were not allowed to read in this book? He got hold of the book on the sly, while his mother was downstairs talking, and disappeared with his booty to the attic. All went well for a few days. His mother knew what he was doing, but didn’t tell tales, until his father found out. He was very angry, took the book away, and thought that that would finish the whole business. However, he had not allowed for his son’s curiosity, which waxed rather than waned because of his father’s attitude."

"Woensdag, 16 Februari 1944","Wednesday, February 16, 1944","TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1944 The minor run-in with Dussel had several repercussions, for which he had only himself to blame. Monday evening Dussel came in to see Mother and told her triumphantly that Peter had asked him that morning if he’d slept well, and then added how sorry he was about what had happened Sunday evening—he hadn’t really meant what he’d said.","Wednesday, 16 February, 1944"
‘Ik hoop het’. (Hij was erg verlegen en roodachtig.),'I hope so'. (He was very shy and reddish.),"“I hope so.” (He was very shy, and blushing.)",“I hope so.” (He was very shy and rather red in the face.)
"‘Ja, dat is goed, nou dáág!!!’","""Yes, that's good, now bye!!!""","“Yes, that’s fine. Bye-bye!”","“Yes, that’s fine, good-bye!”"
"Zondagochtend merkte ik al - ik zal eerlijk zijn - tot mijn grote vreugde dat Peter me aldoor zo aankeek. Zo heel anders dan gewoonlijk, ik weet niet, ik kan het niet uitleggen hoe.","On Sunday morning I noticed - I'll be honest - to my great joy that Peter kept looking at me like that. So very different from usual, I don't know, I can't explain how.","On Sunday morning I noticed, to my great joy (I’ll be honest with you), that Peter kept looking at me. Not in the usual way.","To my great joy—I will be quite honest about it—already this morning I noticed that Peter kept looking at me all the time. Not in the ordinary way, I don’t know how, I just can’t explain."
"'s Avonds in bed vond ik de hele situatie lang niet opwekkend en het idee, dat ik om Peters gunsten moet smeken, gewoon afstotend. Men doet heel wat om zijn verlangens te bevredigen, dat zie je wel aan mij, want ik nam me voor vaker bij Peter te gaan zitten en hem op de een of andere manier aan de praat te krijgen.","In bed at night I found the whole situation unexciting and the idea of having to beg for Peter's favors just repulsive. One does a lot to satisfy his desires, you can see that in me, because I decided to sit with Peter more often and somehow get him to talk.","That night I lay in bed and cried my eyes out, all the while making sure no one could hear me. The idea that I had to beg Peter for favors was simply revolting. But people will do almost anything to satisfy their longings; take me, for example, I’ve made up my mind to visit Peter more often and, somehow, get him to talk to me.","When I lay in bed and thought over the whole situation, I found it far from encouraging, and the idea that I should beg for Peter’s patronage was simply repellent. One can do a lot to satisfy ones longings, which certainly sticks out in my case, for I have made up my mind to go and sit with Peter more often and to get him talking somehow or other."
"Het is smoorheet, iedereen puft en bakt en in die hitte moet ik alles belopen. Nu zie ik pas hoe fijn een tram toch is, vooral een open, maar dat genot is voor ons Joden niet langer weggelegd, voor ons is de benenwagen goed genoeg. Gisteren moest ik tussen de middag naar de Jan Luykenstraat naar de tandarts. Het is van onze school in de Stadstimmertuinen een lange weg; op school viel ik 's middags dan ook haast in slaap. Gelukkig dat de mensen je vanzelf al iets te drinken aanbieden, de zuster van den tandarts is werkelijk een hartelijk mens.","It is sweltering hot, everyone is puffing and baking and in that heat I have to walk everywhere. Only now do I see how nice a tram is, especially an open one, but that pleasure is no longer available to us Jews, the legs are good enough for us. Yesterday I had to go to the dentist in the Jan Luykenstraat at noon. It is a long way from our school in the Stadstimmertuinen; I almost fell asleep at school that afternoon. It's a good thing that people already offer you something to drink, the dentist's sister is really a warm-hearted person.","It’s sweltering. Everyone is huffing and puffing, and in this heat I have to walk everywhere. Only now do I realize how pleasant a streetcar is, but we Jews are no longer allowed to make use of this luxury; our own two feet are good enough for us. Yesterday at lunchtime I had an appointment with the dentist on Jan Luykenstraat. It’s a long way from our school on Stadstimmertuinen. That afternoon I nearly fell asleep at my desk. Fortunately, people automatically offer you something to drink. The dental assistant is really kind.","It is boiling hot, we are all positively melting, and in this heat I have to walk everywhere.

"Volgens mij kan moeders zin niet opgaan, want wat moet je doen, als je zelf de ellende beleeft? Dan ben je verloren. Daarentegen vind ik, dat er nog altijd iets moois overblijft, aan de natuur, de zonneschijn, de vrijheid, aan jezelf, daar heb je wat aan. Kijk daarnaar, dan vind je jezelf weer en God, dan word je evenwichtig.","I don't think mother's sentence can hold true, because what should you do if you experience the misery yourself? Then you are lost. On the other hand, I think that there is still something beautiful left, about nature, the sunshine, freedom, yourself, that is of some use. Look at that, then you find yourself again and God, then you become balanced.","I don’t think Mother’s advice can be right, because what are you supposed to do if you become part of the suffering? You’d be completely lost. On the contrary, beauty remains, even in misfortune. If you just look for it, you discover more and more happiness and regain your balance.","I don’t see how Mummy’s idea can be right, because then how are you supposed to behave if you go through the misery yourself? Then you are lost. On the contrary, I’ve found that there is always some beauty left in nature, in sunshine, in freedom, in yourself; these can all help you.

"Ons leven verliep met de nodige opwindingen, daar de overgebleven familie niet door Hitlers Jodenwetten gespaard bleef. In 1938 na de progroms vluchtten mijn twee ooms, broers van mijn moeder en belandden veilig in U.S.A. Mijn oude grootmoeder kwam bij ons, ze was toen 73 jaar. Na Mei 1940 ging het bergaf met de goede tijden: eerst de oorlog, de capitulatie, intocht der Duitsers, waarna de ellende voor ons Joden begon. Jodenwet volgde op Jodenwet. Joden moeten een Jodenster dragen. Joden moeten hun fietsen afgeven. Joden mogen niet in de tram, Joden mogen niet meer in auto's rijden. Joden mogen alleen van 3-5 uur boodschappen doen en alleen in Joodse winkels, waar ‘Joods lokaal’ opstaat. Joden mogen vanaf 8 uur 's avonds niet op straat zijn en ook niet in hun tuin zitten, noch bij kennissen. Joden mogen zich niet in schouwburgen, bioscopen of andere voor vermaak dienende plaatsen ophouden, Joden mogen in het openbaar generlei sport beoefenen, ze mogen geen zwembad, tennisbaan, hockeyveld of andere sportplaats betreden. Joden mogen ook niet bij Christenen aan huis komen. Joden moeten op Joodse scholen gaan en nog veel meer van dergelijke beperkingen.","Our lives were filled with excitement, as the remaining family was not spared by Hitler's Jewish laws. In 1938 after the progroms, my two uncles, my mother's brothers, fled and landed safely in U.S.A. My old grandmother came to us when she was 73 years old. After May 1940 it went downhill with the good times: first the war, the capitulation, entry of the Germans, after which the misery began for us Jews. Jewish law followed Jewish law. Jews must wear a Star of David. Jews have to hand in their bicycles. Jews are not allowed on the tram, Jews are no longer allowed to drive in cars. Jews are only allowed to go shopping from 3-5 pm and only in Jewish shops, which read 'Jewish local'. Jews are not allowed to be on the street from 8 p.m. or in their garden or with acquaintances. Jews are not allowed to stay in theatres, cinemas or other places for entertainment, Jews are not allowed to practice any sport in public, they are not allowed to enter a swimming pool, tennis court, hockey field or other sports place. Jews are also not allowed to visit Christians at home. Jews have to go to Jewish schools and many more such restrictions.","At the end of the year we were both in tears as we said a heartbreaking farewell, because I’d been accepted at the Jewish Lyceum, where Margot also went to school. Our lives were not without anxiety, since our relatives in Germany were suffering under Hitler’s anti-Jewish laws. After the pogroms in 1938 my two uncles (my mother’s brothers) fled Germany, finding safe refuge in North America. My elderly grandmother came to live with us. She was seventy-three years old at the time. After May 1940 the good times were few and far between: first there was the war, then the capitulation and then the arrival of the Germans, which is when the trouble started for the Jews. Our freedom was severely restricted by a series of anti-Jewish decrees: Jews were required to wear a yellow star; Jews were required to turn in their bicycles; Jews were forbidden to use streetcars; Jews were forbidden to ride in cars, even their own; Jews were required to do their shopping between 3 and 5 P.M.; Jews were required to frequent only Jewish-owned barbershops and beauty parlors; Jews were forbidden to be out on the streets between 8 P.M. and 6 A.M.; Jews were forbidden to go to theaters, movies or any other forms of entertainment; Jews were forbidden to use swimming pools, tennis courts, hockey fields or any other athletic fields; Jews were forbidden to go rowing; Jews were forbidden to take part in any athletic activity in public; Jews were forbidden to sit in their gardens or those of their friends after 8 P.M.; Jews were forbidden to visit Christians in their homes; Jews were required to attend Jewish schools, etc.","The rest of our family, however, felt the full impact of Hitler’s anti-Jewish laws, so life was filled with anxiety. In 1938, after the pogroms, my two uncles (my mother’s brothers) escaped to the U.S.A. My old grandmother came to us, she was then seventy-three. After May 1940, good times rapidly ued: first the war, then the capitulation, followed by the arrival of the Germans, which is when the sufferings of us Jews really began. Anti-Jewish decrees followed each other in quick succession. Jews must wear a yellow star; Jews must hand in their bicycles; Jews are banned from trams and are forbidden to drive; Jews are only allowed to do their shopping between 3 o’clock and 5 o’clock and then only in shops which bear the placard 'Jewish shop.’ Jews must be indoors by 8 o’clock and cannot even sit in their own gardens after that hour. Jews are forbidden to visit theatres, cinemas, and other places of entertainment; Jews may not take part in public sports. Swimming baths, tennis courts, hockey fields, and other sports grounds are all prohibited to them; Jews may not visit Christians; Jews must go to Jewish schools, and many more restrictions of a similar kind."

Except with my girlfriends. He thinks they’re very childish, and he’s right about that. Jacque still teases me about him, but I’m not in love with him. Not really. It’s all right for me to have boys as friends. Nobody minds. Mother is always asking me who I’m going to marry when I grow up, but I bet she’ll never guess it ’s Peter, because I talked her out of that idea myself, without batting an eyelash. I love Peter as I’ve never loved anyone, and I tell myself he’s only going around with all those other girls to hide his feelings for me. Maybe he thinks Hello and I are in love with each other, which we’re not. He’s just a friend, or as Mother puts it, a beau.","It’s easy to see that Hello is in love with me, rather fun for a change.

"Kitty, ik ben net als een verliefde, die niets anders te vertellen weet dan van haar schat. Peter is ook inderdaad een schat. Wanneer zou ik hem dat eens kunnen vertellen? Natuurlijk alleen als hij mij ook een schat vindt, maar ik ben geen katje om zonder handschoenen aan te pakken, dat weet ik heus wel. En hij houdt van zijn rust, dus in hoeverre hij mij aardig vindt, daar heb ik geen idee van. In ieder geval leren we elkaar een beetje kennen, ik wou maar vast, dat we voor veel meer dingen zouden durven uitkomen. Wie weet komt die tijd gauwer dan ik denk! Zo'n paar keer per dag krijg ik een blik van verstandhouding van hem, ik knipoog terug en we zijn alle twee blij.","Kitty, I'm like a lover who knows nothing to say but about her darling. Peter is indeed a treasure. When could I tell him that? Of course only if he thinks I'm a treasure too, but I'm not a kitten to handle without gloves, I know that. And he likes his rest, so how much he likes me, I have no idea. In any case, we get to know each other a bit, I just wish that we would dare to say many more things. Who knows, that time may come sooner than I think! A few times a day I get a look of understanding from him, I wink back and we are both happy.","Kitty, I sound like someone who’s in love and can talk about nothing but her dearest darling. And Peter is a darling. Will I ever be able to tell him that? Only if he thinks the same of me, but I’m the kind of person you have to treat with kid gloves, I know that all too well. And he likes to be left alone, so I don’t know how much he likes me. In any case, we’re getting to know each other a little better. I wish we dared to say more. But who knows, maybe that time will come sooner than I think! Once or twice a day he gives me a knowing glance, I wink back, and we’re both happy.","Kitty, I’m just like someone in love, who can only talk about her darling. And Peter really is a darling. When shall I be able to tell him so? Naturally, only if he thinks I’m a darling too. But I’m quite capable of looking after myself, and he knows that very well. And he likes his tranquillity, so I have no idea how much he likes me. In any case, we are getting to know each other a bit. I wish we dared to tell each other much more already. Who knows, the time may come sooner than I think! I get an understanding look from him about twice a day, I wink back, and we both feel happy."

"voor dit doel opgeofferd hebben. Deze weckpotten hebben we tijdens het loodgietersbezoek in de kamer gezet en onze behoeften daarin overdag bewaard. Dit vond ik niet zo akelig dan dat ik de hele dag stil moest blijven zitten en ook niet mocht praten. Je kunt je niet indenken hoe moeilijk dat juffrouw Kwek-kwek-kwek gevallen is. Op gewone dagen moeten we al fluisteren; helemaal niet spreken en bewegen is nog 10 keer erger. Mijn achterste was, na drie dagen aanéén-stuk-door plat gedrukt te zijn, helemaal stijf en pijnlijk.

On ordinary days we have to whisper; not speaking and moving at all is 10 times worse. My butt, after being flattened for three days straight, was completely stiff and sore. Evening gymnastics helped.","On the day of our arrival, Father and I improvised a chamber pot, sacrificing a canning jar for this purpose. For the duration of the plumber’s visit, canning jars were put into service during the daytime to hold our calls of nature. As far as I was concerned, this wasn’t half as difficult as having to sit still all day and not say a word. You can imagine how hard that was for Miss Quack, Quack, Quack. On ordinary days we have to speak in a whisper; not being able to talk or move at all is ten times worse. After three days of constant sitting, my backside was stiff and sore. Nightly calisthenics helped.","Not having a better receptacle, we sacrificed a glass preserving jar for this purpose. During the plumber’s visit, nature’s offerings were deposited in these jars in the sitting room during the day, I don’t think this was nearly as bad as having to sit still and not talk the whole day. You can’t imagine what a trial that was for 'Miss Quack-Quack.’ I have to whisper on ordinary days, but not being able to speak or move was ten times worse. After being uattened by three days of continuous sitting, my bottom was very stiff and painful. Some exercises at bedtime helped."
"Om ons wat afleiding en ontwikkeling te bezorgen heeft vader een prospectus van de Leidse Onderwijs Instelling aangevraagd. Margot neusde het dikke boek wel drie keer door, zonder dat ze iets naar haar gading en haar beurs vond. Vader was vlugger om iets te vinden, hij wilde naar de instelling laten schrijven en om een proefles ‘Elementair Latijn’ vragen. Zo gezegd, zo gedaan, de les kwam, Margot trok enthousiast aan het werk en de cursus werd genomen. Voor mij is hij veel te moeilijk, hoewel ik erg graag Latijn zou leren.","To give us some distraction and development, father has requested a prospectus from the Leiden Education Institution. Margot sifted through the thick book three times, without finding anything to her liking or her purse. Father was quicker to find something, he wanted to write to the institution and ask for a trial lesson in Elementary Latin. No sooner said than done, the lesson came, Margot set to work enthusiastically and the course was taken. It is much too difficult for me, although I would very much like to learn Latin.","To take our minds off matters as well as to develop them, Father ordered a catalog from a correspondence school. Margot pored through the thick brochure three times without finding anything to her liking and within her budget.

The lesson arrived, Margot set to work enthusiastically and decided to take the course, despite the expense. It’s much too hard for me, though I’d really like to learn Latin.","In order to give us something to do, which is also educational. Daddy applied for a prospectus from a correspondence school.

"Ik krab weer door. Kijk dan weer even naar de andere kant nu, waar vader zit; voor vader is aardappels krabben geen karwei, maar een precies werkje.

Dan heeft hij zijn aardappelgezicht en nooit zal-ie een minder goed gekrabde aardappel afleveren; dat bestaat eenvoudig niet als hij zo'n gezicht trekt.","I'm scratching again. Then look again to the other side now, where father is sitting; for father, scratching potatoes is not a chore, but a precise job. When he reads he has a deep wrinkle in the back of his mind, but when he helps prepare potatoes, beans or other vegetables, it seems as if nothing gets through to him. Then he has his potato face and he will never deliver a less well-scratched potato; it simply doesn't exist when he makes a face like that.","I keep on peeling. Then I look at Father, on the other side of me. To Father, peeling potatoes is not a chore, but precision work. When he reads, he has a deep wrinkle in the back of his head. But when he’s preparing potatoes, beans or vegetables, he seems to be totally absorbed in his task. He puts on his potato-peeling face, and when it’s set in that particular way, it would be impossible for him to turn out anything less than a perfectly peeled potato.","I scrape on again. Now I look to the other side, where Daddy is sitting; for him scraping potatoes is not just a little odd job, but a piece of precision work. When he reads, he has a deep wrinkle at the back of his head, but if he helps prepare potatoes, beans, or any other vegetables, then it seems as if nothing else penetrates. Then he has on his 'potato face,’ and he would never hand over an imperfectly scraped potato; it’s out of the question when he makes that face!"

"Om 3 uur (Harry was even weggegaan, om later terug te komen) belde er iemand aan de deur. Ik hoorde het niet, daar ik lui in een ligstoel op de veranda in de zon lag te lezen.

(Van Daan is een goede kennis en medewerker in papa's zaak.) Ik schrok ontzettend, een oproep, iedereen weet wat dat betekent; concentratiekampen en eenzame cellen zag ik al in mijn geest opdoemen en daarnaartoe zouden wij vader laten vertrekken. ‘Hij gaat natuurlijk niet’, verklaarde Margot mij, toen wij in de kamer op moeder zaten te wachten.","At 3 o'clock (Harry had left for a while, to come back later) someone rang the doorbell.

"Dat ik dit niet wilde inzien en veel medelijden met mezelf had is eveneens te begrijpen.

Mother and Dussel and the rest of us didn’t agree with her, so now we’re dividing up the potatoes as well. It seems the fats and oils aren’t being doled out fairly, and Mother’s going to have to put a stop to it. I’ll let you know if there are any interesting developments. For the last few months now we’ve been splitting up the meat (theirs with fat, ours without), the soup (they eat it, we don’t), the potatoes (theirs peeled, ours not), the extras and now the fried potatoes too.

Het onheil was al gauw hersteld, maar het is een bekend feit, dat katteplasjes verschrikkelijk stinken.

"Nu weet ik wel, waarom ik zoveel onrustiger ben dan Peter. Hij heeft een eigen kamer waar hij in werkt, droomt, denkt en slaapt. Ik word van de eene hoek naar de andere geduwd. Alleen in mijn gedeelde kamer ben ik haast nooit en toch verlang ik daarnaar zo erg. Dat is dan ook de reden, dat ik zo vaak naar de zolder vlucht. Daar en bij jou kan ik even, heel even mezelf zijn. Toch wil ik over mijn verlangen niet zeuren, integendeel, ik wil moedig zijn. De anderen kunnen gelukkig niets van mijn innerlijke gevoelens merken, behalve dat ik met de dag koeler tegenover moeder sta, vader minder liefkoos en ook tegenover Margot niets meer loslaat. Ik ben potdicht. Vóór alles moet ik mijn uiterlijke zekerheid bewaren, niemand mag weten, dat er in me nog altijd oorlog heerst. Oorlog tussen mijn verlangen en verstand. Tot nu toe heeft het laatste de overwinning behaald, maar zal niet toch het eerste het sterkste blijken? Soms vrees en vaak verlang ik van wel!","Now I know why I am so much more restless than Peter. He has his own room in which he works, dreams, thinks and sleeps. I am pushed from one corner to the other. I am hardly ever alone in my shared room and yet I long for it so much. That is why I so often flee to the attic. There and with you I can be myself for a little while. Yet I don't want to whine about my desire, on the contrary, I want to be courageous. Fortunately, the others can't notice my inner feelings, except that by the day I am cooler towards Mother, less fond of Father and I no longer let go of anything towards Margot. I'm sealed. Above all I must keep my outer certainty, no one should know that there is still war in me. War between my desire and mind. So far the latter has won, but won't the former prove the strongest after all? Sometimes I fear and often I long to!","I now know why I’m so much more restless than Peter.

On the contrary, I want to be brave! Thank goodness the others notice nothing of my innermost feelings, except that every day I’m growing cooler and more contemptuous of Mother, less affectionate to Father and less willing to share a single thought with Margot; I’m closed up tighter than a drum. Above all, I have to maintain my air of confidence. No one must know that my heart and mind are constantly at war with each other. Up to now reason has always won the battle, but will my emotions get the upper hand? Sometimes I fear they will, but more often I actually hope they do!","Now I know why I’m so much more restless than Peter. He has his own room where he can work, dream, think, and sleep.

Hij zou Dinsdag bij Kraler komen en dan verder vertellen. Op het politiebureau wisten ze nog niets van de inbraak af, maar noteerden het meteen om ook Dinsdag te komen kijken. Op de terugweg liep Henk toevallig even bij onze aardappelleverancier om de hoek aan en vertelde dat er ingebroken was. ‘Dat weet ik’, zei deze doodleuk, ‘ik kwam gisteravond met mijn vrouw langs uw perceel en zag een gat in de deur. Mijn vrouw wou al doorlopen, maar ik keek even met de lantaarn; toen liepen de dieven meteen weg. Voor alle zekerheid heb ik de politie maar niet opgebeld, daar ik dat bij u niet wou doen, ik weet wel niets, maar ik vermoed veel’.","'At Slagter's house, the woman told me, because the gentleman was sleeping, that her husband had discovered the hole with us on his trip around the canals and had walked through the plot with a police officer who had been called in. He would come to Kraler on Tuesday and then tell him more. At the police station, they knew nothing about the burglary, but immediately noted it down to come and have a look on Tuesday. On the way back Henk happened to stop by our potato supplier around the corner and told him that there had been a break-in. 'I know,' said this one coolly, 'I passed your property with my wife last night and saw a hole in the door. My wife wanted to walk on, but I looked briefly with the lantern; then the thieves immediately ran away. Just to be sure, I didn't call the police, because I didn't want to do that with you, I don't know anything, but I suspect a lot.""","Mr. Sleegers was asleep, but his wife told Jan that her husband had discovered the hole in the door while making his rounds. He called in a policeman, and the two of them searched the building. Mr. Sleegers, in his capacity as night watchman, patrols the area every night on his bike, accompanied by his two dogs. His wife said he would come on Tuesday and tell Mr. Kugler the rest. No one at the police station seemed to know anything about the break-in, but they made a note to come first thing Tuesday morning to have a look. On the way back Jan happened to run into Mr. van Hoeven, the man who supplies us with potatoes, and told him of the break-in. “I know,” Mr. van Hoeven calmly replied. “Last night when my wife and I were walking past your building, I saw a gap in the door. My wife wanted to walk on, but I peeked inside with a flashlight, and that’s when the burglars must have run off. To be on the safe side, I didn’t call the police. I thought it wouldn’t be wise in your case.

He would be coming to see Kugler on Tuesday and would tell him more then. At the police station they knew nothing of the burglary yet, but the policeman had made a note of it at once and would come and look round on Tuesday. On the way back Jan happened to meet our green-grocer at the corner, and told him that the house had been broken into. “I know that,” he said quite coolly. “I was passing last evening with my wife and saw the hole in the door. My wife wanted to walk on, but I just had a look in with my torch, then the thieves cleared at once.

"Het werd mij wonderlijk te moede, telkens als ik in zijn donkerblauwe ogen keek en hij daar zat met die geheimzinnige glimlach om zijn mond. Ik kon uit alles zo zijn innerlijk lezen, ik zag op zijn gezicht nog die hulpeloosheid en die onzekerheid hoe zich te houden en tegelijkertijd een zweem van het besef van zijn mannelijkheid. Ik zag zo die verlegen houding en werd zo zacht van binnen, ik kon het niet laten telkens en telkens weer die donkere ogen te ontmoeten en smeekte haast met heel mijn hart: o vertel me toch wat er in je omgaat, o kijk toch over die noodlottige babbelzucht heen.","It amazes me wonderfully every time I looked into his dark blue eyes and he sat there with that mysterious smile on his mouth. I could read his interior from everything, I still saw on his face that helplessness and that uncertainty how to hold himself and at the same time a hint of the realization of his masculinity. I saw so that shy attitude and became so soft inside, I could not help meeting those dark eyes again and again and begged almost with all my heart: O tell me what's on your mind, O look over that fatal chatter.","It gave me a wonderful feeling when I looked into his dark blue eyes and saw how bashful my unexpected visit had made him. I could read his innermost thoughts, and in his face I saw a look of helplessness and uncertainty as to how to behave, and at the same time a flicker of awareness of his masculinity. I saw his shyness, and I melted. I wanted to say, “Tell me about yourself. Look beneath my chatty exterior.”","It gave me a queer feeling each time I looked into his deep blue eyes, and he sat there with that mysterious laugh playing round his lips. I was able to read his inward thoughts. I could see on his face that look of helplessness and uncertainty how to behave, and, at the same time, a trace of his sense of manhood. I noticed his shy manner and it made me feel very gentle; I couldn’t refrain from meeting those dark eyes again and again, and with my whole heart I almost beseeched him: oh, tell me, what is going on inside you, oh, can’t you look beyond this ridiculous chatter?"

Dit keer vervolg van de Achterhuis-dagindeling. Na het schaftuurtje is de middagtafel aan de beurt:,This time continuation of the Secret Annex daily schedule. After lunch it is the turn of the afternoon table:,"We now continue with a typical day in the Annex. Since we’ve already had lunch, it’s time to describe dinner.",To continue with the 'Secret Annexe’ daily timetable. I shall now describe the evening meal:
"Daarmee begint en eindigt altijd de hele woordenstroom: ‘als Anne mijn dochter was’. Nu, gelukkig ben ik dat niet.","The whole stream of words always begins and ends with that: 'if Anne were my daughter'.

"Nu over iets anders: Je weet al lang dat mijn liefste wens is eenmaal journaliste en later een beroemd schrijfster te worden. Of ik deze grootheidsneigingen (of - waanzin?) ooit tot uitvoering zal kunnen brengen, zal nog moeten blijken, maar onderwerpen heb ik tot nu toe nog wel. Na de oorlog wil ik in ieder geval een boek getiteld ‘Het Achterhuis’ uitgeven. Of dat lukt blijft ook nog de vraag, maar mijn dagboek zal daarvoor kunnen dienen.","Now about something else: You've known for a long time that my dearest wish is to become a journalist one day and later a famous writer. Whether I will ever be able to carry out these grandiose tendencies (or - madness?) remains to be seen, but I still have subjects so far. After the war I want to publish a book entitled 'The Secret Annex'. Whether that will work remains to be seen, but my diary will serve that purpose.","And now something else. You’ve known for a long time that my greatest wish is to be a journalist, and later on, a famous writer. We’ll have to wait and see if these grand illusions (or delusions!) will ever come true, but up to now I’ve had no lack of topics. In any case, after the war I’d like to publish a book called The Secret Annex. It remains to be seen whether I’ll succeed, but my diary can serve as the basis. I also need to finish “Cady’s Life.” I’ve thought up the rest of the plot. After being cured in the sanatorium, Cady goes back home and continues writing to Hans. It’s 1941, and it doesn’t take her long to discover Hans’s Nazi sympathies, and since Cady is deeply concerned with the plight of the Jews and of her friend Marianne, they begin drifting apart. They meet and get back together, but break up when Hans takes up with another girl. Cady is shattered, and because she wants to have a good job, she studies nursing. After graduation she accepts a position, at the urging of her father’s friends, as a nurse in a TB sanatorium in Switzerland. During her first vacation she goes to Lake Como, where she runs into Hans. He tells her that two years earlier he’d married Cady’s successor, but that his wife took her life in a fit of depression. Now that he’s seen his little Cady again, he realizes how much he loves her, and once more asks for her hand in marriage. Cady refuses, even though, in spite of herself, she loves him as much as ever. But her pride holds her back. Hans goes away, and years later Cady learns that he’s wound up in England, where he’s struggling with ill health. When she’s twenty-seven, Cady marries a well-to-do man from the country, named Simon. She grows to love him, but not as much as Hans. She has two daughters and a son, Lilian, Judith and Nico. She and Simon are happy together, but Hans is always in the back of her mind until one night she dreams of him and says farewell.","Now, about something else: you’ve known for a long time that my greatest wish is to become a journalist someday and later on a famous writer. Whether these leanings towards greatness (or insanity?) will ever materialise remains to be seen, but I certainly have the subjects in my mind. In any case, I want to publish a book entitled The Secret Annexe after the war. Whether I shall succeed or not, I cannot say, but my diary will be a great help."

"Het gaat hen nooit vervelen. Ik heb iets uitgevonden en de uitwerking daarvan is denderend; het is net of je iemand met een speld prikt en hem daardoor op laat springen.

"Het is geen verbeelding dat het zien van de hemel, de wolken, de maan en de sterren mij rustig en afwachtend maakt. Dit middel is veel beter dan valeriaan of broom, de natuur maakt mij deemoedig en gereed om alle slagen dapper op te vangen.","It is no imagination that seeing the sky, the clouds, the moon and the stars makes me calm and expectant. This remedy is much better than valerian or bromine, nature makes me humble and ready to take all blows bravely.","It’s not just my imagination—looking at the sky, the clouds, the moon and the stars really does make me feel calm and hopeful. It’s much better medicine than valerian or bromide. Nature makes me feel humble and ready to face every blow with courage! As luck would have it, I’m only able—except for a few rare occasions—to view nature through dusty curtains tacked over dirt-caked windows; it takes the pleasure out of looking. Nature is the one thing for which there is no substitute! One of the many questions that have often bothered me is why women have been, and still are, thought to be so inferior to men. It’s easy to say it’s unfair, but that’s not enough for me ; I’d really like to know the reason for this great injustice! Men presumably dominated women from the very beginning because of their greater physical strength; it’s men who earn a living, beget children and do as they please … Until recently, women silently went along with this, which was stupid, since the longer it’s kept up, the more deeply entrenched it becomes. Fortunately, education, work and progress have opened women’s eyes. In many countries they’ve been granted equal rights; many people, mainly women, but also men, now realize how wrong it was to tolerate this state of affairs for so long. Modern women want the right to be completely independent! But that’s not all. Women should be respected as well! Generally speaking, men are held in great esteem in all parts of the world, so why shouldn’t women have their share? Soldiers and war heroes are honored and commemorated, explorers are granted immortal fame, martyrs are revered, but how many people look upon women too as soldiers? In the book Men Against Death I was greatly struck by the fact that in childbirth alone, women commonly suffer more pain, illness and misery than any war hero ever does. And what’s her reward for enduring all that pain? She gets pushed aside when she’s disfigured by birth, her children soon leave, her beauty is gone. Women, who struggle and suffer pain to ensure the continuation of the human race, make much tougher and more courageous soldiers than all those big-mouthed freedom-fighting heroes put together! I don’t mean to imply that women should stop having children; on the contrary, nature intended them to, and that’s the way it should be. What I condemn are our system of values and the men who don’t acknowledge how great, difficult, but ultimately beautiful women’s share in society is.","It’s not imagination on my part when I say that to look up at the sky , the clouds, the moon, and the stars makes me calm and patient. It’s a better medicine than either valerian or bromide. Mother Nature makes me humble and prepared to face every blow courageously."

' Lie down on the uoor then and sleep.’ Margot and I were each given a pillow and one blanket; she was lying just near the store cupboard and I between the table legs. The smell wasn’t quite so bad when one was on the uoor, but still Mrs. van Daan quietly brought some chlorine, a tea towel over the pot serving as a second expedient."
"Bij Elli thuis heerst diphterie, daarom mag ze zes weken lang niet met ons in aanraking komen.

Kraler is extremely busy.","Owing to an outbreak of diphtheria at Bep’s, she won’t be allowed to come in contact with us for six weeks.

"Vader is de laatste tijd veel thuis, in de zaak heeft hij niets meer te zoeken; naar gevoel moet dat zijn om je nu zo overbodig te voelen. Mijnheer Koophuis heeft de Travies overgenomen en mijnheer Kraler de firma Kolen & Co. Toen we een paar dagen geleden samen om ons pleintje wandelden, begon vader over onderduiken te praten. Hij had het er over, dat het erg moeilijk voor ons zal zijn om helemaal afgescheiden van de wereld te leven. Ik vroeg hem, waarom hij daar nu al over sprak. ‘Ja, Anne’, zei hij daarop, ‘je weet dat we al meer dan een jaar kleren, levensmiddelen en meubelen naar andere mensen brengen. Wij willen onze goederen niet in de handen van de Duitsers laten vallen, maar nog minder willen wij zelf gepakt worden. Wij zullen daarom uit onszelf weggaan en niet wachten, tot we gehaald worden’.","Father has been home a lot lately, he has no business in the business anymore; I feel it must be to feel so superfluous now. Mr Koophuis has taken over the Travies and Mr Kraler has taken over the company Kolen & Co. When we were walking around our little square a few days ago, father started talking about going into hiding. He talked about how it will be very difficult for us to live completely separated from the world. I asked him why he was already talking about it. “Yes, Anne,” he replied, “you know that we have been taking clothes, foodstuffs and furniture to other people for over a year. We don't want to let our goods fall into the hands of the Germans, much less do we want to be caught ourselves. We will therefore go out of ourselves and not wait until we are taken.”","Father has been home a lot lately. There’s nothing for him to do at the office; it must be awful to feel you’re not needed. Mr. Kleiman has taken over Opekta, and Mr. Kugler, Gies & Co., the company dealing in spices and spice substitutes that was set up in 1941. A few days ago, as we were taking a stroll around our neighborhood square, Father began to talk about going into hiding. He said it would be very hard for us to live cut off from the rest of the world. I asked him why he was bringing this up now. “Well, Anne,” he replied, “you know that for more than a year we’ve been bringing clothes, food and furniture to other people. We don’t want our belongings to be seized by the Germans. Nor do we want to fall into their clutches ourselves. So we’ll leave of our own accord and not wait to be hauled away.”","Daddy has been at home a lot lately, as there is nothing for him to do at business; it must be rotten to feel so superuuous. Mr. Kleiman has taken over Opekta and Mr. Kugler the firm Ges & Co. When we walked across our little square together a few days ago, Daddy began to talk of us going into hiding. I asked him why on earth he was beginning to talk of that already. “Yes, Anne,” he said, “You know that we have been taking food, clothes, furniture to other people for more than a year now. We don’t want our belongings to be seized by the Germans, but we certainly don’t want to fall into their clutches ourselves. So we shall disappear of our own accord and not wait until they come and fetch us.”"

"Hij stond met zijn hoofd tegen de dikke balk aangeleund, ik zat, we ademden de lucht in, keken naar buiten en voelden, dat dit iets was om niet met woorden te onderbreken. We keken heel lang naar buiten en toen hij moest gaan om hout te hakken op de vliering, wist ik, dat hij een fijne kerel is. Hij klom de trap op, ik volgde en gedurende het kwartier dat hij hout hakte spraken we weer geen woord. Ik keek van mijn standplaats naar hem, hoe hij zichtbaar zijn best deed goed te hakken, om zijn kracht aan mij te tonen. Maar ik keek ook uit het open raam, over een groot stuk van Amsterdam heen, over alle daken tot aan de horizon, die zo licht blauw was, dat de scheidingslijn niet duidelijk te zien was. ‘Zolang dit nog bestaat’, dacht ik ‘en ik het mag beleven, deze zonneschijn, die hemel waaraan geen wolk is, zolang kan ik niet treurig zijn’.","He stood with his head leaning against the thick beam, I sat, we breathed in the air, looked out and felt that this was something not to interrupt with words. We looked out for a long time, and when he had to go and chop wood in the attic, I knew he's a fine fellow. He climbed the stairs, I followed, and for the quarter of an hour that he was chopping wood, we didn't speak a word. I looked at him from where I stood, how he visibly tried his best to chop well, to show me his strength. But I also looked out the open window, over a large part of Amsterdam, over all the roofs to the horizon, which was so light blue that the dividing line was not clearly visible. 'As long as this still exists', I thought 'and I may experience it, this sunshine, that sky where there is no cloud, I cannot be sad for that long'.","He stood with his head against a thick beam, while I sat. We breathed in the air, looked outside and both felt that the spell shouldn’t be broken with words. We remained like this for a long while, and by the time he had to go to the loft to chop wood, I knew he was a good, decent boy. He climbed the ladder to the loft, and I followed; during the fifteen minutes he was chopping wood, we didn’t say a word either. I watched him from where I was standing, and could see he was obviously doing his best to chop the right way and show off his strength. But I also looked out the open window, letting my eyes roam over a large part of Amsterdam, over the rooftops and on to the horizon, a strip of blue so pale it was almost invisible. “As long as this exists,” I thought, “this sunshine and this cloudless sky, and as long as I can enjoy it, how can I be sad?”","Peter was tidying up when I went this morning. He stood with his head against a thick beam, and I sat down. We breathed the fresh air, looked outside, and both felt that the spell should not be broken by words. We remained like this for a long time, and when he had to go up to the loft to chop wood, I knew that he was a nice fellow. He climbed the ladder, and I followed, then he chopped wood for about a quarter of an hour, during which time we still remained silent. I watched him from where I stood, he was obviously doing his best to show off his strength. But I looked out of the open window too, over a large area of Amsterdam, over all the roofs and on to the horizon, which was such a pale blue-that it was hard to see the dividing line. “As long as this exists,” I thought, “and I may live to see it, this sunshine, the cloudless skies, while this lasts, I cannot be unhappy.”"
"Ik heb een sterk uitkomende karaktertrek die iedereen die me langer kent moet opvallen, en wel mijn zelfkennis. Ik kan mezelf bij al mijn handelingen bekijken, alsof ik een vreemde was. Helemaal niet vooringenomen of met een zak verontschuldigingen sta ik dan tegenover de Anne van elke dag en kijk toe wat die goed en wat ze slecht doet. Dat ‘zelfgevoel’ laat me nooit los en bij elk woord dat ik uitspreek weet ik dadelijk als het uitgesproken is: ‘Dit had anders moeten zijn’, of ‘Dat is goed zo als het is’. Ik veroordeel mezelf in zo onnoemelijk veel dingen en zie steeds meer hoe waar dat woord van vader was: ‘Ieder kind moet zichzelf opvoeden’. Ouders kunnen alleen raad of goede aanwijzingen meegeven, de uiteindelijke vorming van iemands karakter ligt in zijn eigen hand.","I have a strong character trait that anyone who has known me longer should notice, and that is my self-knowledge. I can watch myself in all my actions, as if I were a stranger. Not at all biased or with a bag of apologies, I stand in front of the Anne of every day and watch what she does well and what she does badly. I never let go of that 'feeling of self' and with every word I say I immediately know when it has been spoken: 'This should have been different', or 'That is good as it is'. I condemn myself in so many things and see more and more how true that father's word was: 'Every child should educate himself'. Parents can only give advice or good directions, the ultimate formation of a person's character is in his own hands.","I have one outstanding character trait that must be obvious to anyone who’s known me for any length of time: I have a great deal of self-knowledge. In everything I do, I can watch myself as if I were a stranger. I can stand across from the everyday Anne and, without being biased or making excuses, watch what she’s doing, both the good and the bad. This self-awareness never leaves me, and every time I open my mouth, I think, “You should have said that differently” or “That’s fine the way it is. ” I condemn myself in so many ways that I’m beginning to realize the truth of Father’s adage: “Every child has to raise itself.” Parents can only advise their children or point them in the right direction. Ultimately, people shape their own characters.","I have one outstanding trait in my character, which must strike anyone who knows me for any length of time, and that is my knowledge of myself. I can watch myself and my actions just like an outsider. The Anne of everyday I can face entirely without prejudice, without making excuses for her, and watch what’s good and what’s bad about her. This self- consciousness haunts me, and every time I open my mouth , I know as soon as I’ve spoken whether 'that ought to have been different’ or 'that was right as it was.’ There are so many things about myself that I condemn, I couldn’t begin to name them all. I understand more and more how true Daddy ’s words were when he said: 'All children must look after their own upbringing.’ Parents can only give good advice or put them on the right paths, but the final forming of a person’s character lies in their own hands."

From three-thirty onward I was engrossed in thought, and still shivering so much that Mr. van Daan couldn’t sleep. I was preparing myself for the return of the police. We’d tell them we were in hiding; if they were good people, we’d be safe, and if they were Nazi sympathizers, we could try to bribe them!","“For heaven’s sake, give me something to put on!” I asked. I was given something, but don’t ask what—a pair of woolen knickers over my pajamas, a red jumper, and a black skirt, white oversocks and a pair of sports stockings full of holes. Then Mrs. van Daan sat in the chair and her husband came and lay on my feet. I lay thinking till half past three, shivering the whole time, which prevented van Daan from sleeping.

But I can see that a little hypocrisy gets me a lot further than my old method of saying exactly what I think (even though no one ever asks my opinion or cares one way or another).","To return to the 'upbringing’ theme for the umpteenth time, I must tell you that I really am trying to be helpful, friendly, and good, and to do everything I can so that the rain of rebukes dies down to a light summer drizzle.

"Henk heeft het herderlijk schrijven van de bisschoppen aan de mensen in de kerk voor ons meegebracht. Het was reuze-mooi en opwekkend geschreven. ‘Blijft niet stilzitten, Nederlanders, ieder vechte met zijn eigen wapenen voor de vrijheid van land, volk en godsdienst! Helpt, geeft, aarzelt niet!’ Dat roepen ze zomaar van de preekstoel. Zou het helpen? Onzen geloofsgenoten stellig niet.","Henk has brought the pastoral letter of the bishops to the people in the church for us. It was beautifully written and exciting. Do not sit still, Dutch, each fight with his own weapons for the freedom of the country, people and religion! Help, give, don't hesitate!' That's what they shout from the pulpit. Would it help? Certainly not our fellow believers.","Jan brought along the episcopal letter that the bishops addressed to their parishioners. It was beautiful and inspiring. “People of the Netherlands, stand up and take action. Each of us must choose our own weapons to fight for the freedom of our country, our people and our religion!

It’s definitely too late to help our fellow Jews.","Jan brought a copy of the bishop’s letter to churchgoers for us to read. It was very fine and inspiring. “Do not rest, people of the Netherlands, everyone is fighting with his own weapons to free the country, the people, and their religion.” “Give help, be generous, and do not dismay!” is what they cry from the pulpit, just like that. Will it help? It won’t help the people of our religion."
"De laatste tijd mag ik wat meer volwassenen-boeken lezen. Ik ben nu bezig met Eva's jeugd van Nico van Suchtelen. Het verschil tussen meisjesromans en dit vind ik niet zo erg groot. Wel staan er ook dingen in over het verkopen van hun lichaam door vrouwen aan onbekende mannen in straatjes. Ze vragen er een schep geld voor. Ik zou me doodschamen tegenover zo'n man. Verder staat er ook in, dat Eva ongesteld is geworden; hè, daar verlang ik zo naar, het lijkt me zo gewichtig.","Lately I've been allowed to read some more adult books. I am now working on Eva's childhood by Nico van Suchtelen. I don't think the difference between girls' novels and this is that big. It does, however, also contain things about women selling their bodies to unknown men in the streets. They charge a lot of money for it. I would be ashamed of myself in front of such a man. Furthermore, it also says that Eve has had her period; hey, that's what I long for, it seems so important to me.","Father wants me to start reading books by Hebbel and other well-known German writers. I can read German fairly well by now, except that I usually mumble the words instead of reading them silently to myself. But that’ll pass.","I’m allowed to read more grown-up books lately. I’m now reading Wilma’s Youth by Nico van Suchtelen. I can’t see much difference between this and the schoolgirl love stories. It is true there are bits about women selling themselves to unknown men in back streets. They ask a packet of money for it. I’d die of shame if anything like that happened to me. Also it says that Wilma has a monthly period. Oh, I’m so longing to have it too, it seems so important."

"Ik moet zeggen dat de schuilcommissie Achterhuis (afd. heren) zeer vindingrijk is. Moet je horen, wat ze nu weer bedacht hebben om mijnheer Van Dijk, hoofdvertegenwoordiger van Travies, goeden kennis en clandestiene-goederenopberger, een bericht van ons te laten zien! Ze tikken een brief aan een drogist in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, klant van de zaak, en wel zo, dat de man een ingesloten briefje als antwoord moet insturen en in de bijgevoegde enveloppe terug moet zenden. Op die enveloppe schrijft vader het adres. Als deze enveloppe uit Zeeland terugkomt, wordt het inliggende briefje er uit gehaald en een met de hand geschreven levensteken van vader er in gestopt. Zo kan Van Dijk het lezen zonder argwaan te krijgen. Ze hebben juist Zeeland gekozen, omdat dit dicht bij België ligt en het briefje dus makkelijk over de grens gesmokkeld kan zijn, waarbij nog komt, dat niemand daar zonder speciale vergunning naar toe mag.","I must say that the Secret Annex (department gentlemen) is very resourceful. Hear what they've come up with now to show Mr. Van Dijk, chief representative of Travies, good acquaintance and clandestine goods storer, a message from us! They type a letter to a drugstore in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, a customer of the business, in such a way that the man has to send in an enclosed note as a reply and return it in the enclosed envelope. Father writes the address on that envelope. When this envelope returns from Zeeland, the inner note is removed and a handwritten sign of life from father is placed in it. That way Van Dijk can read it without getting suspicious. They have chosen Zeeland, because it is close to Belgium and so the note can easily have been smuggled across the border, adding that no one is allowed to go there without a special permit.","I must say that the Annex Committee (the men’s section) is very creative. Listen to the scheme they’ve come up with to get a message to Mr. Broks, an Opekta Co. sales representative and friend who’s surreptitiously hidden some of our things for us! They’re going to type a letter to a store owner in southern Zeeland who is, indirectly, one of Opekta’s customers and ask him to fill out a form and send it back in the enclosed self-addressed envelope. Father will write the address on the envelope himself. Once the letter is returned from Zeeland, the form can be removed and a handwritten message confirming that Father is alive can be inserted in the envelope. This way Mr. Broks can read the letter without suspecting a ruse. They chose the province of Zeeland because it’s close to Belgium (a letter can easily be smuggled across the border) and because no one is allowed to travel there without a special permit. An ordinary salesman like Mr. Broks would never be granted a permit. Yesterday Father put on another act. Groggy with sleep, he stumbled off to bed. His feet were cold, so I lent him my bed socks. Five minutes later he flung them to the floor. Then he pulled the blankets over his head because the light bothered him. The lamp was switched off, and he gingerly poked his head out from under the covers. It was all very amusing. We started talking about the fact that Peter says Margot is a “buttinsky.” Suddenly Daddy’s voice was heard from the depths: “Sits on her butt, you mean.” Mouschi, the cat, is becoming nicer to me as time goes by, but I’m still somewhat afraid of her.","I must say that the Refuge Committee of the 'Secret Annexe’ (male section) is very ingenious. I’ll tell you what they’ve done now to get news of us through to Mr. Van Broks, Opekta’s chief representative and a friend who has surreptitiously hidden some of our things for us! They typed a letter to a chemist in South Zealand, who does business with our firm, in such a way that he has to send the enclosed reply back in an addressed envelope. Daddy addressed the envelope to the oﬃce. When this envelope arrives from Zealand, the enclosed letter is taken out and is replaced by a message in Daddy’s handwriting as a sign of life. Like this, Van Broks won’t become suspicious when he reads the note. They specially chose Zealand because it is so close to Belgium and the letter could have easily been smuggled over the border; in addition no one is allowed into Zealand without a special permit, so if they thought we were there, he couldn’t try and look us up."

"Je weet nu, nadat we ruim een jaar Achterhuizers zijn, wel wat van ons leven af, maar volledig kan ik je toch niet inlichten. Het is alles zo uitgebreid, anders dan in gewone tijden en bij gewone mensen. Om je toch een beetje een nadere blik in ons leven te gunnen zal ik in het vervolg af en toe een stuk van een gewone dag beschrijven.

Without realizing it, he’d put his hand on a large rat, which had bitten him in the arm.

"Nu heb ik voortaan Woensdagavonds altijd vrij, omdat ik voor mijn grootouders naar houtsnijles ga, maar in werkelijkheid ga ik naar zo'n clubje van de zionistische beweging. Dat mag ik niet, omdat mijn grootouders erg tegen het zionisme zijn. Ik ben er ook niet fanatiek vóór, maar ik voel er wel wat voor en interesseer me er voor. Maar de laatste tijd is het daar ook zo'n rommelzootje, dat ik van plan ben er uit te gaan en daarom is Woensdagavond de laatste avond dat ik er naar toe ga. Dan kan ik dus Woensdagavond, Zaterdagmiddag, Zaterdagavond, Zondagmiddag en misschien nog wel vaker met jou omgaan’.","Now from now on I always have Wednesday evenings off, because I go to woodcarving lessons for my grandparents, but in reality I go to such a club of the Zionist movement. I can't, because my grandparents are very much against Zionism. I'm not fanatical about it either, but I do feel something and am interested in it. But lately it's been such a mess there too, that I'm planning to go out and that's why Wednesday evening is the last night I go there. Then I can hang out with you on Wednesday evening, Saturday afternoon, Saturday evening, Sunday afternoon and maybe even more often'.","From now on I’ll be free on Wednesday evenings. You see, my grandparents made me sign up for a wood-carving class, but actually I go to a club organized by the Zionists. My grandparents don’t want me to go, because they’re anti-Zionists. I’m not a fanatic Zionist, but it interests me. Anyway, it’s been such a mess lately that I’m planning to quit. So next Wednesday will be my last meeting. That means I can see you Wednesday evening, Saturday afternoon, Saturday evening, Sunday afternoon and maybe even more.”","From now on I shall be free on Wednesday evenings. Oﬃcially, I go to wood-carving lessons to please my grandparents, but in actual fact I go to a meeting of the Zionist Movement. I’m not supposed to, because my grandparents are very much against the Zionists. I’m by no means a fanatic, but I have a leaning that way and find it interesting.

"Als ik zo wel eens bedenk hoe we hier leven kom ik meestal tot de conclusie dat we het hier, in verhouding tot de andere Joden, die niet ondergedoken zijn, als in een paradijs hebben.

Met struisvogelpolitiek komen wij er niet, dat heeft Engeland en dat heeft de hele wereld ingezien en daarvoor moeten alle geallieerden nu stuk voor stuk en Engeland niet het minst zware offers brengen.","What obligations do the English have to us then? How have the Dutch earned the generous aid they so fervently expect? Oh no, the Dutch will still be very mistaken, the English, despite all their bluff, are certainly no more embarrassed than all the other countries and small countries that are now occupied. The English will certainly make no apologies for us, for, if we should reproach them for having slept during the years when Germany armed itself, we cannot deny that all the other countries, especially those bordering Germany, also slept. to have.

"Hij is het zich niet bewust, dat hij met Margot anders omgaat dan met mij. Margot is nu eenmaal de knapste, de liefste, de mooiste en de beste. Maar een beetje recht op ernst heb ik toch ook. Ik was altijd de clown en de deugniet van de familie, moest altijd voor alle daden dubbel boeten, één keer met standjes en één keer met de wanhopigheid binnen in mezelf.

"Ik heb je al eens meer verteld, dat mijn ziel als het ware in tweeën gesplitst is. De ene kant herbergt mijn uitgelaten vrolijkheid, spotternijen om alles, mijn levenslust en vooral het opvatten van de lichte kant van alles. Daaronder versta ik geen aanstoot nemen aan flirten, een zoen, een omhelzing, een onnette mop. Deze kant zit meestal op de loer en verdringt de andere, die veel mooier, reiner en dieper is. Niet waar, de mooie zijde van Anne kent niemand en daarom kunnen mij ook zo weinig mensen lijden.","I have told you before, that my soul is, as it were, split in two. One side contains my exuberant cheerfulness, mockery of everything, my zest for life and above all taking the bright side of everything.

One side contains my exuberant cheerfulness, my flippancy, my joy in life and, above all, my ability to appreciate the lighter side of things. By that I mean not finding anything wrong with flirtations, a kiss, an embrace, an off-color joke. This side of me is usually lying in wait to ambush the other one, which is much purer, deeper and finer. No one knows Anne’s better side, and that’s why most people can’t stand me.","I’ve already told you before that I have, as it were, a dual personality. One half embodies my exuberant cheerfulness, making fun of everything, my high spiritedness and, above all, the way I take everything lightly. This includes not taking offence at a uirtation, a kiss, an embrace, a dirty joke. This side is usually lying in wait and pushes away the other, which is much better, deeper and purer.

"Afgezakt in dien zin van het woord, waar het de manieren betreft. We hebben bijvoorbeeld al sinds we hier zijn altijd op onze tafel één zeildoek, dat door het vele gebruik meestal niet tot de schoonste behoort. Wel probeer ik het vaak wat op te knappen met een vuile afwasdoek, die meer gat dan doek is. Zelfs hiermee valt op de tafel, met nog zo hard boenen, niet veel eer te behalen. De Van Daans slapen nu al de hele winter op een lap flanel, die men hier niet wassen kan, omdat de bonzeeppoeder veel te schaars en bovendien veel te slecht is. Vader loopt met een gerafelde broek en ook zijn das vertoont slijtage. Mama's korset is vandaag afgeknapt van ouderdom en is niet meer te repareren, terwijl Margot met een twee maten te kleine bustehouder loopt.","Descended in the sense of the word, as far as manners are concerned. For example, since we have been here, we have always had one tarpaulin on our table, which is usually not one of the cleanest due to frequent use. I often try to fix it up with a dirty dishcloth, which is more hole than cloth. Even with this there is not much credit to be gained on the table, with scrubbing so hard. The Van Daans have been sleeping all winter on a piece of flannel, which one cannot wash here, because the bon soap powder is much too scarce and also much too bad. Father is wearing frayed trousers and his tie is also showing signs of wear. Mum's corset has snapped today from old age and is beyond repair, while Margot wears a bra two sizes too small.","With respect to manners, I mean. For example, the same oilcloth has covered the dining table ever since we’ve been here. After so much use, it’s hardly what you’d call spotless. I do my best to clean it, but since the dishcloth was also purchased before we went into hiding and consists of more holes than cloth, it’s a thankless task. The van Daans have been sleeping all winter long on the same flannel sheet, which can’t be washed because detergent is rationed and in short supply. Besides, it’s of such poor quality that it’s practically useless. Father is walking around in frayed trousers, and his tie is also showing signs of wear and tear. Mama’s corset snapped today and is beyond repair, while Margot is wearing a bra that’s two sizes too small.","By this I mean that our manners have declined. For instance, ever since we have been here, we have had one oilcloth on our table which, owing to so much use, is not one of the cleanest. Admittedly I often try to clean it with a dirty dishcloth, which is more hole than cloth. The table doesn’t do us much credit either, in spite of hard scrubbing. The van Daans have been sleeping on the same uannelette sheet the whole winter, one can’t wash it here because the soap powder we get on the ration isn’t suﬃcient, and besides it’s not good enough. Daddy goes about in frayed trousers and his tie is beginning to show signs of wear too. Mummy’s corsets have split today and are too old to be repaired, while Margot goes about in a brassiere two sizes too small for her."

Dat is het laatste nieuws.","All right here, moods are moving forward. Our hyperoptimists triumph. Elli has changed her haircut, Miep has a week off. That's the latest news.","Everything’s all right here. Spirits are improving, our superoptimists are triumphant, the van Daans are doing disappearing acts with the sugar, Bep’s changed her hair, and Miep has a week off.

"Overdag moeten we altijd erg zacht lopen en zacht spreken, want in het magazijn mogen ze ons niet horen.","During the day we always have to walk very softly and speak softly, because in the warehouse they are not allowed to hear us.","SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1942 They were all so nice to me a month ago because of my birthday, and yet every day I feel myself drifting further away from Mother and Margot. I worked hard today and they praised me, only to start picking on me again five minutes later. You can easily see the difference between the way they deal with Margot and the way they deal with me. For example, Margot broke the vacuum cleaner, and because of that we’ve been without light for the rest of the day. Mother said, “Well, Margot, it’s easy to see you’re not used to working; otherwise, you’d have known better than to yank the plug out by the cord.” Margot made some reply, and that was the end of the story. But this afternoon, when I wanted to rewrite something on Mother’s shopping list because her handwriting is so hard to read, she wouldn’t let me. She bawled me out again, and the whole family wound up getting involved. I don’t fit in with them, and I’ve felt that clearly in the last few weeks. They’re so sentimental together, but I’d rather be sentimental on my own. They’re always saying how nice it is with the four of us, and that we get along so well, without giving a moment’s thought to the fact that I don’t feel that way. Daddy’s the only one who understands me, now and again, though he usually sides with Mother and Margot. Another thing I can’t stand is having them talk about me in front of outsiders, telling them how I cried or how sensibly I’m behaving. It’s horrible. And sometimes they talk about Moortje and I can’t take that at all. Moortje is my weak spot. I miss her every minute of the day, and no one knows how often I think of her; whenever I do, my eyes fill with tears. Moortje is so sweet, and I love her so much that I keep dreaming she’ll come back to us. I have plenty of dreams, but the reality is that we’ll have to stay here until the war is over. We can’t ever go outside, and the only visitors we can have are Miep, her husband Jan, Bep Voskuijl, Mr. Voskuijl, Mr. Kugler, Mr. Kleiman and Mrs. Kleiman, though she hasn’t come because she thinks it’s too dangerous. COMMENT ADDED BY ANNE IN SEPTEMBER 1942: Daddy’s always so nice. He understands me perfectly, and I wish we could have a heart-to-heart talk sometime without my bursting instantly into tears. But apparently that has to do with my age. I’d like to spend all my time writing, but that would probably get boring.","We have to whisper and tread lightly during the day, otherwise the people in the warehouse might hear us."

"Nu het vervolg van mijn verhaal, want dat was nog niet klaar, weet je. Op de Prinsengracht aangekomen nam Miep ons gauw mee naar boven, het Achterhuis in. Ze sloot de deur achter ons en we waren alleen. Margot was er met de fiets veel sneller aangekomen en wachtte al op ons. Onze huiskamer en alle andere kamers waren zo vol rommel, dat het niet te beschrijven is. Alle cartonnen dozen, die in de loop van de voorafgegane maanden naar kantoor gestuurd waren, stonden op de grond en op de bedden. Het kleine kamertje was tot aan het plafond met beddegoed gevuld. Als we 's avonds op behoorlijk opgemaakte bedden zouden willen slapen, moesten we direct aan de gang gaan en de boel opruimen. Moeder en Margot waren niet in staat een lid te verroeren, zij lagen op de kale bedden, waren moe, ellendig en ik weet niet wat al meer. Maar vader en ik, de twee opruimers in de familie, wilden dadelijk beginnen.","Now the continuation of my story, because that wasn't finished yet, you know. When we arrived at the Prinsengracht, Miep quickly took us upstairs, into the Secret Annex. She closed the door behind us and we were alone. Margot had arrived much faster by bike and was already waiting for us. Our living room and all the other rooms were so cluttered that it is indescribable. All the cardboard boxes that had been sent to the office during the previous months were on the floor and on the beds. The small room was filled to the ceiling with bedding. If we wanted to sleep on properly made beds in the evenings, we had to go straight to work and clean up. Mother and Margot were unable to move a member, they lay on the bare beds, tired, miserable and I don't know what else. But Dad and I, the two cleaners in the family, wanted to get started right away.","But first, let me continue my story, because, as you know, I wasn’t finished. After we arrived at 263 Prinsengracht, Miep quickly led us through the long hallway and up the wooden staircase to the next floor and into the Annex. She shut the door behind us, leaving us alone. Margot had arrived much earlier on her bike and was waiting for us. Our living room and all the other rooms were so full of stuff that I can’t find the words to describe it. All the cardboard boxes that had been sent to the office in the last few months were piled on the floors and beds. The small room was filled from floor to ceiling with linens. If we wanted to sleep in properly made beds that night, we had to get going and straighten up the mess. Mother and Margot were unable to move a muscle. They lay down on their bare mattresses, tired, miserable and I don’t know what else. But Father and I, the two cleaner-uppers in the family, started in right away.","To continue my story—you see, I’ve not finished yet— when we arrived at the Prinsengracht, Miep took us upstairs quickly into the “Secret Annexe.” She closed the door behind us and we were alone. Margot was already waiting for us, having come much faster on her bicycle. Our living room and all the other rooms were chockfull of rubbish, and indescribably so. All the cardboard boxes which had been sent to the oﬃce in the previous months lay piled on the uoor and the beds. The little room was filled to the ceiling with bedclothes. We had to start clearing up immediately, if we wished to sleep in decent beds that night. Mummy and Margot were not in a fit state to take part; they were tired and lay down on their beds, they were miserable, and lots more besides. But the two “clearers-up” of the family— Daddy and myself—wanted to start at once."
"We aten de eerste dag van ons samenzijn gezellig met elkaar en na drie dagen wisten we allen niet anders meer dan dat we één grote familie waren geworden. Zoals vanzelf spreekt hadden de Van Daans nog veel over de week, die zij na ons in de bewoonde wereld doorbrachten, te vertellen. Onder meer interesseerde het ons sterk wat er met onze woning en met mijnheer Goudsmit gebeurd was.","We ate together on the first day of our meeting and after three days we all knew nothing more than that we had become one big family. It goes without saying that the Van Daans still had a lot to tell about the week they spent in the inhabited world after us. Among other things, we were very interested in what had happened to our house and to Mr Goudsmit.","From the first, we ate our meals together, and after three days it felt as if the seven of us had become one big family. Naturally, the van Daans had much to tell about the week we’d been away from civilization. We were especially interested in what had happened to our apartment and to Mr. Goldschmidt.","From the day they arrived we all had meals cozily together and after three days it was just as if we were one large family.

"Maar ik kan het niet, ik kan hun mijn vertwijfeling niet laten zien; ik kan hun geen blik laten slaan in de wonden die zij mij toebrachten, ik zou hun medelijden en hun goedmoedige spot niet kunnen verdragen, ook dan nog zou ik moeten schreeuwen. Iedereen vindt me aanstellerig als ik praat, belachelijk als ik zwijg, brutaal als ik antwoord geef, geslepen als ik een goed idee heb, lui als ik moe ben, egoïstisch als ik een hap te veel eet, dom, laf berekenend enzovoort enzovoort. De hele dag hoor ik niets anders dan dat ik een onuitstaanbaar wicht ben, en hoewel ik er om lach, doe of ik me er niets van aantrek, kan het me wel wat schelen, zou ik God wel willen vragen me een andere natuur te geven, die niet alle mensen tegen me in het harnas jaagt.","But I cannot, I cannot show them my despair; I cannot let them look into the wounds they inflicted on me, I could not bear their pity and their good-natured mockery, even then I would have to scream. Everyone thinks I'm affected when I talk, ridiculous when I'm silent, cheeky when I answer, cunning when I have a good idea, lazy when I'm tired, selfish when I eat one bite too much, stupid, cowardly calculating and so on and so forth. All day long I hear nothing but that I'm an insufferable weight, and though I laugh at it, pretend I don't care, I care if I ask God to give me a different nature , which doesn't antagonize all people against me.","But I can’t do that.

"Het kan ook gebeuren, dat er 's nachts variërend tussen een en vier uur geschoten wordt. Dit besef ik nooit helemaal vóór ik uit gewoonte naast mijn bed sta. Soms ben ik ook zo aan het dromen, dat ik denk aan Franse onregelmatige werkwoorden of een bovenruzietje. Als dit dan afgelopen is, merk ik pas dat er geschoten is en ik stil in de kamer gebleven ben. Maar meestal gebeurt, zoals boven gezegd. Vlug wordt een kussen plus zakdoek in de hand gestopt, badjas aan, pantoffels en dan op een holletje naar vader, net zoals Margot in een verjaardagsgedicht schreef:","It can also happen that shooting takes place at night varying between one and four hours. I never fully realize this until I am habitually beside my bed. Sometimes I am also so dreaming that I think of French irregular verbs or an upper quarrel. When this is over, I only notice that shots have been fired and I have remained silent in the room. But usually happens, as said above. Quickly a pillow plus handkerchief is put in hand, bathrobe on, slippers on and then run to father, just as Margot wrote in a birthday poem:","Sometimes the guns go off during the night, between one and four. I’m never aware of it before it happens, but all of a sudden I find myself standing beside my bed, out of sheer habit. Occasionally I’m dreaming so deeply (of irregular French verbs or a quarrel upstairs) that I realize only when my dream is over that the shooting has stopped and that I’ve remained quietly in my room. But usually I wake up. Then I grab a pillow and a handkerchief, throw on my robe and slippers and dash next door to Father, just the way Margot described in this birthday poem:","It can also happen that we get a bit of shooting in the night, varying between 1 o’clock and four. I never really realise it, until from habit I am already standing at my bedside. Sometimes I’m so busy dreaming that I’m thinking about French irregular verbs or a quarrel upstairs. It is some time before I begin to realise that guns are firing and that I am still in the room. But it usually happens as described above. I quickly grab a pillow and handkerchief, put on my dressing gown and slippers, and scamper to Daddy, like Margot wrote in this birthday poem:"
"Lieve Kitty,","Dear kitty,","Dearest Kitty, I’ve told you more about myself and my feelings than I’ve ever told a living soul, so why shouldn’t that include sex? Parents, and people in general, are very peculiar when it comes to sex. Instead of telling their sons and daughters everything at the age of twelve, they send the children out of the room the moment the subject arises and leave them to find out everything on their own. Later on, when parents notice that their children have, somehow, come by their information, they assume they know more (or less) than they actually do. So why don’t they try to make amends by asking them what’s what? A major stumbling block for the adults— though in my opinion it’s no more than a pebble—is that they’re afraid their children will no longer look upon marriage as sacred and pure once they realize that, in most cases, this purity is a lot of nonsense. As far as I’m concerned, it’s not wrong for a man to bring a little experience to a marriage. After all, it has nothing to do with the marriage itself, does it? Soon after I turned eleven, they told me about menstruation. But even then, I had no idea where the blood came from or what it was for. When I was twelve and a half, I learned some more from Jacque, who wasn’t as ignorant as I was. My own intuition told me what a man and a woman do when they’re together; it seemed like a crazy idea at first, but when Jacque confirmed it, I was proud of myself for having figured it out! It was also Jacque who told me that children didn’t come out of their mother’s tummies. As she put it, “Where the ingredients go in is where the finished product comes out!” Jacque and I found out about the hymen, and quite a few other details, from a book on sex education. I also knew that you could keep from having children, but how that worked inside your body remained a mystery. When I came here, Father told me about prostitutes, etc., but all in all there are still unanswered questions. If mothers don’t tell their children everything, they hear it in bits and pieces, and that can’t be right. Even though it’s Saturday, I’m not bored! That’s because I’ve been up in the attic with Peter. I sat there dreaming with my eyes closed, and it was wonderful. Yours, Anne M. Frank SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1944 Dearest Kitty,","Dear Kitty,"
"Intussen is er een schaduw op mijn geluk gevallen. Ik dacht het wel al lang, dat ook Margot Peter meer dan aardig vond. In hoeverre ze van hem houdt weet ik niet, maar ik vind het erg naar. Elke keer, dat ik Peter nu ontmoet, moet ik haar opzettelijk pijn doen en het mooiste is, dat zij haast niets laat merken.","Meanwhile, a shadow has fallen on my happiness. I've been thinking for a long time that Margot also liked Peter more than anything. I don't know how much she loves him, but I think it's really bad. Every time I meet Peter now, I have to intentionally hurt her and the best part is that she hardly shows anything.","In the meantime, a shadow has fallen on my happiness. For a long time I’ve had the feeling that Margot likes Peter. Just how much I don’t know, but the whole situation is very unpleasant. Now every time I go see Peter I’m hurting her, without meaning to. The funny thing is that she hardly lets it show.","In the meantime a little shadow has fallen on my happiness. I’ve thought for a long time that Margot liked Peter quite a lot too. How much she loves him I don’t know, but I think this is wretched. I must cause her terrible pain each time I’m with Peter, and the funny part of it is that she hardly shows it."
"Maar even later voelde ik me toch weer hoopvol en vol verwachting, terwijl de tranen in me nog vloeiden.","But moments later I felt hopeful and expectant again, while the tears were still flowing in me.","A little later I felt hopeful and full of expectation again, though my tears were still flowing—on the inside. Yours, Anne M. Frank SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1944 What happens in other people’s houses during the rest of the week happens here in the Annex on Sundays. While other people put on their best clothes and go strolling in the sun, we scrub, sweep and do the laundry. Eight o’clock. Though the rest of us prefer to sleep in, Dussel gets up at eight. He goes to the bathroom, then downstairs, then up again and then to the bathroom, where he devotes a whole hour to washing himself. Nine-thirty. The stoves are lit, the blackout screen is taken down, and Mr. van Daan heads for the bathroom. One of my Sunday morning ordeals is having to lie in bed and look at Dussel’s back when he’s praying. I know it sounds strange, but a praying Dussel is a terrible sight to behold. It’s not that he cries or gets sentimental, not at all, but he does spend a quarter of an hour—an entire fifteen minutes—rocking from his toes to his heels. Back and forth, back and forth. It goes on forever, and if I don’t shut my eyes tight, my head starts to spin. Ten-fifteen. The van Daans whistle; the bathroom’s free. In the Frank family quarters, the first sleepy faces are beginning to emerge from their pillows. Then everything happens fast, fast, fast. Margot and I take turns doing the laundry. Since it’s quite cold downstairs, we put on pants and head scarves. Meanwhile, Father is busy in the bathroom. Either Margot or I have a turn in the bathroom at eleven, and then we’re all clean.","However, a little later fresh hope and anticipation seemed to return, even though the tears were still streaming down my cheeks."

"Vier uur, vijf uur, half zes. Nu ging ik bij Peter in de kamer aan het raam zitten luisteren, zo dicht bijeen, dat we de trillingen van elkanders lichaam voelden, we spraken zo nu en dan een woord en luisterden scherp. Naast ons in de kamer ontduisterden ze. Om zeven uur wilden ze Koophuis opbellen en iemand hier laten komen. Nu schreven ze op wat ze Koophuis aan de telefoon wilden vertellen. Het risico, dat de wacht voor de deur of in het magazijn dat opbellen hoorde, was groot, maar het gevaar, dat de politie weer terugkwam, nog groter.","Four o'clock, five o'clock, half past five. Now I sat in the room with Peter at the window and listened, so close that we felt the vibrations of each other's bodies, we spoke a word now and then and listened closely. Next to us in the room they darkened. At seven they wanted to call Koophuis and have someone come here. Now they wrote down what they wanted to tell Koophuis on the phone. The risk that the guard at the door or in the warehouse would hear the ringing was great, but the danger that the police would return again was even greater.","Four o’clock, five, five-thirty. I went and sat with Peter by his window and listened, so close we could feel each other’s bodies trembling; we spoke a word or two from time to time and listened intently. Next door they took down the blackout screen. They made a list of everything they were planning to tell Mr. Kleiman over the phone, because they intended to call him at seven and ask him to send someone over. They were taking a big chance, since the police guard at the door or in the warehouse might hear them calling, but there was an even greater risk that the police would return.","4 o’clock, 5 o’clock, half past five. Then I went and sat with Peter by his window and listened, so close together  that we could feel each other’s bodies quivering; we spoke a word or two now and then, and listened attentively. In the room next door they took down the black-out screen. They wanted to call up Kleiman at seven o’clock and get him to send someone around. Then they wrote down everything they wanted to tell Kleiman over the phone. The risk that the police on guard at the door or in the warehouse might hear the telephone was very great, but the danger of the police returning was even greater."
"Intussen had Peter de geschikte tijd gevonden, waarin niemand naar het boek of naar hem omkeek. 's Avonds om half 8, toen de hele familie in het privé-kantoor naar de radio luisterde, nam hij zijn schat weer mee naar de vliering. Om half 9 had hij weer beneden moeten zijn, maar daar het boek zo spannend was, vergat hij de tijd en kwam net de zoldertrap af, toen zijn vader de kamer binnenkwam. Wat volgde is begrijpelijk! Een tik, een klap, een ruk, het boek lag op tafel en Peter zat op de vliering. Zo stonden de zaken toen de familie ten eten kwam. Peter bleef boven, niemand bekommerde zich om hem, hij moest zonder eten naar bed. Vrolijk keuvelend zetten wij onze maaltijd voort, toen er opeens een doordringend gefluit tot ons doordrong, allen legden de vorken neer en ieder keek de ander met bleek en verschrikt gezicht aan. Dan hoorden we Peters stem, die door de kachelpijp riep: ‘Ik kom toch niet naar beneden, hoor’. Mijnheer Van Daan sprong op, zijn servet viel op de grond, met vuurrood hoofd schreeuwde hij: ‘Maar nu is het genoeg’. Vader pakte hem bij de arm, daar hij erge dingen vreesde en samen gingen de twee heren naar de zolder. Na veel tegenstribbelen en trappen belandde Peter in zijn kamer, de deur ging dicht en wij aten door. Mevrouw wou een boterham voor zoonlief overlaten, mijnheer was onverbiddelijk. ‘Als hij niet dadelijk excuus vraagt, moet hij op de vliering slapen’.","Meanwhile, Peter had found the right time when no one looked at the book or at him. At half past seven in the evening, when the whole family was listening to the radio in the private office, he took his treasure back to the attic. He should have been back downstairs by 8:30, but as the book was so exciting, he forgot the time and was just coming down the attic stairs when his father entered the room. What followed is understandable! A tap, a slap, a tug, the book was on the table and Peter was sitting in the loft. That's how things were when the family came to dinner. Peter stayed upstairs, nobody cared about him, he had to go to bed without food. We continued our meal, chattering happily, when suddenly a piercing whistle came to us, all put down their forks and each looked at the other with a pale and startled face. Then we heard Peter's voice, calling through the stovepipe, ""I'm not coming down anyway."" Mr. Van Daan jumped up, his napkin fell to the floor, his head was crimson, and he shouted: 'But enough is enough'. Father took him by the arm, because he feared bad things, and together the two gentlemen went to the attic. After much struggle and stairs, Peter ended up in his room, the door closed and we continued to eat. Madame wanted to leave a sandwich for my son, sir was relentless. ""If he doesn't apologize right away, he'll have to sleep in the attic.""","Meanwhile, Peter had thought of a suitable time when no one would be interested in either him or the book. At seven-thirty in the evening, when the entire family was listening to the radio in the private office, he took his treasure and stole off to the loft again. He should have been back by eight-thirty, but he was so engrossed in the book that he forgot the time and was just coming down the stairs when his father entered the room. The scene that followed was not surprising: after a slap, a whack and a tug-of-war, the book lay on the table and Peter was in the loft. This is how matters stood when it was time for the family to eat. Peter stayed upstairs. No one gave him a moment’s thought; he’d have to go to bed without his dinner. We continued eating, chatting merrily away, when suddenly we heard a piercing whistle. We lay down our forks and stared at each other, the shock clearly visible on our pale faces. Then we heard Peter’s voice through the chimney: “I won’t come down!” Mr. van Daan leapt up, his napkin falling to the floor, and shouted, with the blood rushing to his face, “I’ve had enough!” Father, afraid of what might happen, grabbed him by the arm and the two men went to the attic. After much struggling and kicking, Peter wound up in his room with the door shut, and we went on eating. Mrs. van Daan wanted to save a piece of bread for her darling son, but Mr. van D. was adamant. “If he doesn’t apologize this minute, he’ll have to sleep in the loft.”","In the meantime Peter had found a time of the day when no one bothered about him or the book: seven-thirty in the evening—then everyone was in the private oﬃce listening to the radio. That was when he took his treasure to the attic again. He should have been downstairs again by eight-thirty but, because the book was so thrilling he forgot the time and was just coming downstairs as his father came into the room. You can imagine the consequences! With a slap and a snatch, the book lay on the table and Peter was in the attic. That’s how matters stood as we sat down to table. Peter stayed upstairs, no one bothered about him, and he had to go to bed without any supper. We went on with the meal, chattering gaily, when suddenly we heard a piercing whistle; we all stopped eating and looked with pale, changed faces at one another. Then we heard Peter’s voice, calling down the chimney, “I say, I’m not coming down anyway.” Mr. van Daan sprang to his feet , his napkin fell down on the uoor, and scarlet in the face he shouted, “I’ve had enough of this.” Daddy took his arm, afraid of what might happen, and the two men went together to the attic. After a good deal of resistance and stamping, Peter landed up in his room with the door closed and we went on eating. Mrs. van Daan wanted to save one slice of bread for the dear boy, but his father stood firm. “If he doesn’t apologise soon, he will have to sleep in the attic.”"

"Mijnheer Koophuis heeft het Boek voor de Jeugd voor me meegebracht. Gisteravond zijn we met zijn vieren naar het privé-kantoor gegaan en hebben de Engelse radio aangezet. Ik was zo ontzettend bang dat iemand dat zou kunnen horen, dat ik vader letterlijk smeekte mee naar boven te gaan. Moeder begreep mijn angst en ging mee. Ook in andere dingen zijn we erg bang, dat de buren ons zouden kunnen horen of zien. Direct de eerste dag hebben we de gordijnen genaaid. Eigenlijk mag men niet van gordijnen spreken, want het zijn maar losse lichte lappen, totaal verschillend van vorm, kwaliteit en motief, die vader en ik erg onvakkundig scheef aan elkaar naaiden. Met punaises zijn deze pronkstukken voor de ramen bevestigd om er vóór het einde van onze onderduiktijd nooit meer af te komen.","Mr Koophuis brought me the Book for Youth. Last night the four of us went to the private office and turned on the English radio. I was so terrified that anyone might hear that that I literally begged Dad to go upstairs with me. Mother understood my fear and went with me. In other things too we are very afraid that the neighbors might hear or see us. Immediately the first day we sewed the curtains. In fact, one should not speak of curtains, because they are just loose, light pieces, completely different in shape, quality and motif, which father and I sewed together very unprofessionally, crooked. These showpieces are fastened to the windows with thumbtacks so that they will never be removed before the end of our time in hiding.","The beans were scorched black, and no amount of scraping could get them out of the pan.

Actually, you can hardly call them that, since they’re nothing but scraps of fabric, varying greatly in shape, quality and pattern, which Father and I stitched crookedly together with unskilled fingers. These works of art were tacked to the windows, where they’ll stay until we come out of hiding.","Mr. Kleiman has brought me a book called Young People’s Annual. The four of us went to the private oﬃce yesterday evening and turned on the radio. I was so terribly frightened that someone might hear it that I simply begged Daddy to come upstairs with me. Mummy understood how I felt and came too. We are very nervous in other ways, too, that the neighbours might hear us or see something going on. We made curtains straight away on the first day. Really one can hardly call them curtains, they are just light, loose strips of material, all different shapes, qualities, and patterns, which Daddy and I sewed together in a most unprofessional way. These works of art are fixed in position with drawing pins, not to come down until we emerge from here."

Monday (a holiday because of Pentecost), Mr. Gies served as the Annex watchman, and Tuesday we were finally allowed to open the windows.

Do you know what I’ve come up with? In order to give me the feeling of calling my mother something that sounds like “Mom,” I often call her “Momsy.” Sometimes I shorten it to “Moms”: an imperfect “Mom.” I wish I could honor her by removing the “s.” It’s a good thing she doesn’t realize this, since it would only make her unhappy.","In spite of all my theories, and however much trouble I take, each day I miss having a real mother who understands me.

"Om vragen te voorkomen zocht ik dus gauw een tamelijk neutraal onderwerp en dacht dat het boek Henri van den Overkant aan die eis wel zou voldoen. Maar ik had me misrekend. Krijg ik mevrouw niet op mijn dak, dan is het mijnheer Dussel. Het kwam hierop neer: mijnheer Dussel had ons dit boek bijzonder aanbevolen, als een uitstekend exemplaar. Margot en ik vonden het evenwel allesbehalve uitstekend. Het jongetje was wel goed getekend, maar de rest ... laat ik daarover liever zwijgen.

But I had miscalculated. If I can't get madam on my roof, then it's Mr. Dussel. It came down to this: Mr. Dussel had highly recommended this book to us, as an excellent copy. Margot and I thought it was anything but excellent. The little boy was well marked, but the rest ... I'd rather keep quiet about that. I brought something similar to the washing up on the carpet and that gave me a huge load.","This is very unusual for me and they were sure to notice, so in order to avoid any questions, I quickly racked my brains for a neutral topic. I thought the book Henry from Across the Street might fit the bill, but I couldn’t have been more wrong; if Mrs. van Daan doesn’t jump down my throat, Mr. Dussel does. It all boiled down to this: Mr. Dussel had recommended the book to Margot and me as an example of excellent writing. We thought it was anything but that. The little boy had been portrayed well, but as for the rest … the less said the better. I mentioned something to that effect while we were doing the dishes, and Dussel launched into a veritable tirade.","In order to avoid questions I quickly sought a fairly neutral topic, and thought that the book Henry from Across the street would meet the need.

"Nu word ik hoopvol, nu eindelijk gaat het goed. Ja heus, het gaat goed! Knalberichten! Er is een moordaanslag op Hitler gepleegd en nu eens niet door Joodse communisten of Engelse kapitalisten, maar door een edel-germaanse Duitse generaal, die graaf en bovendien nog jong is. De Goddelijke voorzienigheid heeft den Führer het leven gered en hij is er jammer genoeg met een paar schrammetjes en wat brandwonden afgekomen. Een paar officieren en generaals uit zijn naaste omgeving zijn gedood of gewond. De hoofddader is gefusilleerd.","Now I'm getting hopeful, now finally things are going well.

Want moedig moeten wij de vele angsten, de ontberingen en het lijden doorstaan, nu komt het er op aan om kalm en standvastig te blijven. Nu meer dan ooit is het zaak de nagels in het vlees te drukken en niet te schreeuwen. Schreeuwen van ellende kunnen Frankrijk, Rusland, Italië en ook Duitsland, maar wij hebben daar het recht nog niet toe!","The Secret Annex in turmoil!

"Hoeveel angst de dames hebben als ze bombarderen, bijvoorbeeld Zondag, toen 350 Engelse machines een half millioen kilo bommen op IJmuiden gegooid hebben, hoe dan de huizen trillen als een grassprietje in de wind, hoeveel epidemieën hier heersen. Van al deze dingen weet jij niets af en ik zou de hele dag aan het schrijven moeten blijven als ik alles in de finesses zou moeten navertellen. De mensen staan in de rij voor groenten en alle mogelijke andere dingen, de dokters kunnen niet bij de zieken komen, omdat om de haverklap hun voertuig wordt gestolen, inbraken en diefstallen zijn er plenty, zo zelfs dat je je gaat afvragen wat de Nederlanders bezielt dat ze opeens zo stelerig geworden zijn. Kleine kinderen van acht en elf jaar slaan de ruiten van woningen in en stelen wat los en vast zit. Niemand durft voor vijf minuten zijn huis te verlaten, want als je weg bent is je boel ook weg. Iedere dag staan advertenties in de krant met beloningen voor het terugbezorgen van gestolen schrijfmachines, perzische kleden, electrische klokken, stoffen enz. enz. Electrische straatklokken worden gedemonteerd, de telefoons in de cellen tot op de laatste draad uit elkaar gehaald. De stemming onder de bevolking kan niet goed zijn: iedereen heeft honger, met het weekrantsoen kan je nog geen twee dagen uitkomen, behalve met koffiesurrogaat. De invasie laat lang op zich wachten, de mannen moeten naar Duitsland. De kinderen worden ziek of zijn ondervoed, iedereen heeft slechte kleren en slechte schoenen.","How much fear the ladies have when they bomb, for example on Sunday, when 350 English machines threw half a million kilos of bombs on IJmuiden, how the houses tremble like a blade of grass in the wind, how many epidemics are prevalent here. You know nothing about all these things and I would have to write all day long if I had to retell everything in detail. People are queuing for vegetables and all sorts of other things, the doctors can't reach the sick because their vehicles are stolen all the time, break-ins and thefts abound, so much so that you start to wonder what the Dutch are on about that they have suddenly become so stealthy. Small children aged eight and eleven smash the windows of houses and steal what is loose and stuck. Nobody dares to leave their house for five minutes, because when you're gone, your stuff is gone too. Every day there are advertisements in the newspaper with rewards for returning stolen typewriters, Persian rugs, electric clocks, fabrics, etc. etc. Electric street clocks are dismantled, the telephones in the cells are disassembled down to the last wire. The mood among the population cannot be good: everyone is hungry, with the weekly ration you cannot survive for two days, except with coffee substitute. The invasion is long in coming, the men have to go to Germany. The children get sick or are malnourished, everyone has bad clothes and bad shoes.","How frightened the women are during air raids; last Sunday, for instance, when 350 British planes dropped 550 tons of bombs on IJmuiden, so that the houses trembled like blades of grass in the wind. Or how many epidemics are raging here. You know nothing of these matters, and it would take me all day to describe everything down to the last detail. People have to stand in line to buy vegetables and all kinds of goods; doctors can’t visit their patients, since their cars and bikes are stolen the moment they turn their backs; burglaries and thefts are so common that you ask yourself what’s suddenly gotten into the Dutch to make them so light-fingered. Little children, eight- and eleven-year-olds, smash the windows of people’s homes and steal whatever they can lay their hands on. People don’t dare leave the house for even five minutes, since they’re liable to come back and find all their belongings gone. Every day the newspapers are filled with reward notices for the return of stolen typewriters, Persian rugs, electric clocks, fabrics, etc. The electric clocks on street corners are dismantled, public phones are stripped down to the last wire. Morale among the Dutch can’t be good. Everyone’s hungry; except for the ersatz coffee, a week’s food ration doesn’t last two days.

"Ik moest alleen naar beneden naar de W.C. om acht uur vanavond, niemand was beneden, allen zaten aan de radio, ik wou moedig zijn, maar het was moeilijk. Ik voel me hierboven nog altijd veiliger dan alleen beneden in dat grote, stille huis; alleen met de geheimzinnige, stommelachtige geluiden van boven en het getoeter van de claxons op straat. Ik tril als ik niet gauw voortmaak en even nadenk over de situatie.","I had to go down to the toilet alone. at eight o'clock tonight, no one was downstairs, all were on the radio, I wanted to be brave, but it was difficult.

"Lieve Kitty,","Dear kitty,","Dear Kitty, “If you’re going to the attic, take an umbrella with you, preferably a large one!” This is to protect you from “household showers.” There’s a Dutch proverb: “High and dry, safe and sound,” but it obviously doesn’t apply to wartime (guns!) and to people in hiding (cat box!). Mouschi’s gotten into the habit of relieving herself on some newspapers or between the cracks in the floorboards, so we have good reason to fear the splatters and, even worse, the stench. The new Moortje in the warehouse has the same problem. Anyone who’s ever had a cat that’s not housebroken can imagine the smells, other than pepper and thyme, that permeate this house. I also have a brand-new prescription for gunfire jitters: When the shooting gets loud, proceed to the nearest wooden staircase. Run up and down a few times, making sure to stumble at least once. What with the scratches and the noise of running and falling, you won’t even be able to hear the shooting, much less worry about it. Yours truly has put this magic formula to use, with great success!

"Weer wachtten en wachtten we, maar niets werd meer vernomen en nu veronderstelden we eigenlijk allemaal dat de dieven, doordat ze stappen in het anders zo stille huis hadden gehoord, de benen genomen hadden. Nu was het ongeluk, dat de radio beneden nog op Engeland stond en de stoelen er ook nog netjes omheen geschaard waren. Als nu de deur geforceerd zou zijn en de luchtbescherming dit zou bemerken en de politie waarschuwen, dan zouden er heel onaangename gevolgen uit het geval kunnen voortvloeien. Dus stond mijnheer Van Daan op, trok zijn jas aan, zette een hoed op en ging achter vader heel voorzichtig de trap af, gevolgd door Peter, die voor alle zekerheid met een zware hamer bewapend was. De dames boven (inclusief Margot en ik) wachtten met spanning tot vijf minuten later de heren boven verschenen en vertelden, dat alles in huis rustig was.","Again we waited and waited, but nothing more was heard and now we all assumed that, having heard steps in the otherwise quiet house, the thieves had run away. Now it was bad luck that the radio downstairs was still on England and the chairs were neatly arranged around it. Now if the door were forced and the air defense were to notice this and alert the police, very unpleasant consequences could result from the case. So Mr. Van Daan got up, put on his coat, put on a hat and went down the stairs very carefully behind Father, followed by Peter, who was armed with a heavy hammer just to be safe.

Finally we came to the conclusion that the burglars had taken to their heels when they heard footsteps in an otherwise quiet building. The problem now was that the chairs in the private office were neatly grouped around the radio, which was tuned to England. If the burglars had forced the door and the air-raid wardens were to notice it and call the police, there could be very serious repercussions.
