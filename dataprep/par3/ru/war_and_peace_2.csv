"Пьер со времени бала чувствовал в себе приближение припадков ипохондрии и с отчаянным усилием старался бороться против них. Со времени сближения принца с его женою, Пьер неожиданно был пожалован в камергеры, и с этого времени он стал чувствовать тяжесть и стыд в большом обществе, и чаще ему стали приходить прежние мрачные мысли о тщете всего человеческого. В это же время замеченное им чувство между покровительствуемой им Наташей и князем Андреем, своей противуположностью между его положением и положением его друга, еще усиливало это мрачное настроение. Он одинаково старался избегать мыслей о своей жене и о Наташе и князе Андрее. Опять всё ему казалось ничтожно в сравнении с вечностью, опять представлялся вопрос: «к чему?». И он дни и ночи заставлял себя трудиться над масонскими работами, надеясь отогнать приближение злого духа. Пьер в 12-м часу, выйдя из покоев графини, сидел у себя наверху в накуренной, низкой комнате, в затасканном халате перед столом и переписывал подлинные шотландские акты, когда кто-то вошел к нему в комнату.

At the same time, the feeling he noticed between Natasha, who was patronized by him, and Prince Andrei, his opposition between his position and the position of his friend, further strengthened this gloomy mood. He equally tried to avoid thinking about his wife and about Natasha and Prince Andrei. Again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison with eternity, again the question presented itself: “what for?”. And he forced himself day and night to work on Masonic works, hoping to drive away the approach of an evil spirit. Pierre at 12 o'clock, having left the chambers of the countess, was sitting upstairs in a smoky, low room, in a worn dressing gown in front of the table and copying genuine Scottish acts, when someone entered his room.

Towards midnight, having left the countess's rooms, Pierre was sitting at his desk upstairs in the low-ceilinged, smoke-filled study, wearing a shabby dressing gown, copying the original Scottish charters, when someone came into his room. It was Prince Andrei.","Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression and had made desperate efforts to combat it. Since the intimacy of his wife with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly been made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, and from that time he had begun to feel oppressed and ashamed in court society, and dark thoughts of the vanity of all things human came to him oftener than before. At the same time the feeling he had noticed between his protégée Natasha and Prince Andrei accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position and his friend’s. He tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife, and about Natasha and Prince Andrei; and again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison with eternity; again the question: For what? presented itself; and he forced himself to work day and night at masonic labours, hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him.

It was Prince Andrei."

"«Весна, и любовь, и счастие!» — как будто говорил этот дуб, — «и как не надоест вам всё один и тот же глупый и бессмысленный обман. Всё одно и то же, и всё обман! Нет ни весны, ни солнца, ни счастия. Вон смотрите, сидят задавленные мертвые ели, всегда одинакие, и вон и я растопырил свои обломанные, ободранные пальцы, где ни выросли они — из спины, из боков; как выросли — так и стою, и не верю вашим надеждам и обманам».","""Spring, and love, and happiness!"" - this oak seemed to be saying, - “and how you don’t get tired of the same stupid and senseless deceit.

"Пьер снял ноги со стола, встал и перелег на приготовленную для него кровать, изредка поглядывая на вошедшего, который с угрюмо-усталым видом, не глядя на Пьера, тяжело раздевался с помощью слуги. Оставшись в заношенном крытом нанкой тулупчике и в валеных сапогах на худых костлявых ногах, проезжий сел на диван, прислонив к спинке свою очень большую и широкую в висках, коротко обстриженную голову и взглянул на Безухого. Строгое, умное и проницательное выражение этого взгляда поразило Пьера. Ему захотелось заговорить с проезжающим, но когда он собрался обратиться к нему с вопросом о дороге, проезжающий уже закрыл глаза и сложив сморщенные старые руки, на пальце одной из которых был большой чугунный перстень с изображением Адамовой головы, неподвижно сидел, или отдыхая, или о чем-то глубокомысленно и спокойно размышляя, как показалось Пьеру. Слуга проезжающего был весь покрытый морщинами, тоже желтый старичек, без усов и бороды, которые видимо не были сбриты, а никогда и не росли у него. Поворотливый старичек-слуга разбирал погребец, приготовлял чайный стол, и принес кипящий самовар. Когда всё было готово, проезжающий открыл глаза, придвинулся к столу и налив себе один стакан чаю, налил другой безбородому старичку и подал ему. Пьер начинал чувствовать беспокойство и необходимость, и даже неизбежность вступления в разговор с этим проезжающим.","Pierre took his feet off the table, got up and lay down on the bed prepared for him, occasionally glancing at the newcomer, who, with a gloomy-tired look, without looking at Pierre, was heavily undressing with the help of a servant. Left in a shabby, covered sheepskin coat and felted boots on thin, bony legs, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaning his very large and wide at the temples, short-cropped head against the back and looked at Bezukhy. The strict, intelligent and penetrating expression of this look struck Pierre. He wanted to speak to the traveler, but when he was about to turn to him with a question about the road, the traveler had already closed his eyes and folded his wrinkled old hands, on the finger of one of which was a large cast-iron ring with the image of Adam's head, sat motionless, or resting, or about something thoughtfully and calmly thinking, as it seemed to Pierre. The passerby's servant was all covered with wrinkles, also a yellow old man, without a mustache and beard, which apparently had not been shaved off, and had never grown with him. The quick-witted old servant was dismantling the cellar, preparing a tea table, and brought a boiling samovar. When everything was ready, the traveler opened his eyes, moved closer to the table and poured himself one glass of tea, poured another for the beardless old man and served it to him. Pierre began to feel anxiety and the need, and even the inevitability of entering into a conversation with this traveler.","Pierre took his feet off the table, got up, and lay down on the bed prepared for him, glancing from time to time at the man who had come in and, not looking at Pierre, with a sullenly weary air, was undressing with difficulty, helped by a servant. Left in a fleece-lined nankeen coat, with felt boots on his skinny, bony legs, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaned his close-cropped head, very big and broad at the temples, against the back, and looked at Bezukhov. The stern, intelligent, and penetrating expression of this look struck Pierre. He wanted to start a conversation with this traveler, but, as he was preparing to address him with a question about the road, the traveler closed his eyes and, folding his wrinkled old man's hands, on the finger of one of which was a big cast-iron signet ring with a death's head, sat motionless, either resting or, as it seemed to Pierre, reflecting deeply and calmly on something. The traveler's servant was also a sallow old man, all covered with wrinkles, with no beard or mustache, which evidently had not been shaved, but had never grown. The agile old servant opened the cellaret, prepared the tea table, and brought a boiling samovar. When everything was ready, the traveler opened his eyes, moved to the table, and, having poured himself a glass, poured another for the beardless old man and handed it to him. Pierre was beginning to feel uneasiness and the necessity, even the unavoidability, of getting into conversation with this traveler.","Pierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a bed that had been got ready for him, glancing now and then at the newcomer, who with a gloomy and tired face was wearily taking off his wraps with the aid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With a pair of felt boots on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn, nankeen-covered sheepskin coat, the traveller sat down on the sofa, leant back his big head with its broad temples and close-cropped hair, and looked at Bezukhov. The stern, shrewd, and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre. He felt a wish to speak to the stranger, but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a question about the roads, the traveller had closed his eyes. His shrivelled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them Pierre noticed a large cast-iron ring with a seal representing a death’s head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or moustache, evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown. The active old servant was unpacking the traveller’s canteen and preparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything was ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom he passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the need, even the inevitability, of entering into conversation with this stranger."

"Как только адъютант сказал это, старый усатый офицер с счастливым лицом и блестящими глазами, подняв кверху саблю, прокричал: «Виват! — и, скомандовав уланам следовать за собой, дал шпоры лошади и подскакал к реке. Он злобно толкнул замявшуюся под собой лошадь и бухнулся в воду, направляясь вглубь к быстрине течения. Сотни уланов поскакали за ним. Было холодно и жутко на середине и на быстрине теченья. Уланы цеплялись друг за друга, сваливались с лошадей, лошади некоторые тонули, тонули и люди, остальные старались плыть кто на седле, кто держась за гриву. Они старались плыть вперед на ту сторону и, несмотря на то, что за полверсты была переправа, гордились тем, что они плывут и тонут в этой реке под взглядами человека, сидевшего на бревне и даже не смотревшего на то, что они делали. Когда вернувшийся адъютант, выбрав удобную минуту, позволил себе обратить внимание императора на преданность поляков к его особе, маленький человек в сером сюртуке встал и, подозвав к себе Бертье, стал ходить с ним взад и вперед по берегу, отдавая ему приказания и изредка недовольно взглядывая на тонувших улан, развлекавших его внимание.","As soon as the adjutant said this, an old mustachioed officer with a happy face and sparkling eyes, raising his saber, shouted: “Vivat! - and, having commanded the lancers to follow him, he gave the spurs to the horse and galloped to the river. He viciously pushed the horse that hesitated under him and thumped into the water, heading deeper into the rapids of the current. Hundreds of lancers galloped after him. It was cold and eerie in the middle and in the rapids of the current. Lancers clung to each other, fell off their horses, some horses drowned, people drowned, the rest tried to swim, some on the saddle, some holding on to the mane. They tried to swim forward to the other side and, despite the fact that there was a crossing half a verst away, they were proud that they were swimming and drowning in this river under the gaze of a man sitting on a log and not even looking at what they were doing. When the returning adjutant, having chosen a convenient moment, allowed himself to draw the Emperor's attention to the devotion of the Poles to his person, a little man in a gray frock coat got up and, calling Berthier to him, began to walk up and down the shore with him, giving him orders and occasionally looking with displeasure on the drowning lancers that entertained his attention.","As soon as the adjutant said it, the mustached old officer, with a happy face and flashing eyes, raising his saber, shouted “Vivat!” and, commanding the uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse and rode to the river.

"Балашев вошел в маленькую приемную, из которой была одна дверь в кабинет, в тот самый кабинет, из которого отправлял его русский император. Балашев простоял один минуты две, ожидая. За дверью послышались поспешные шаги. Быстро отворились обе половинки двери, камергер, отворивший, почтительно остановился, ожидая, все затихло, и из кабинета зазвучали другие, твердые, решительные шаги: это был Наполеон. Он только что окончил свой туалет для верховой езды. Он был в синем мундире, раскрытом над белым жилетом, спускавшимся на круглый живот, в белых лосинах, обтягивающих жирные ляжки коротких ног, и в ботфортах. Короткие волоса его, очевидно, только что были причесаны, но одна прядь волос спускалась книзу над серединой широкого лба. Белая пухлая шея его резко выступала из-за черного воротника мундира; от него пахло одеколоном. На моложавом полном лице его с выступающим подбородком было выражение милостивого и величественного императорского приветствия.","Balashev entered a small reception room, from which there was one door leading to an office, the same office from which the Russian emperor sent him.

Both halves of the door quickly opened, the chamberlain who had opened it respectfully stopped, waiting, everything was quiet, and other, firm, resolute steps sounded from the office: it was Napoleon. He has just finished his riding toilet. He was in a blue uniform, open over a white waistcoat, descending on a round stomach, in white leggings, tight-fitting fat thighs of short legs, and in over the knee boots. His short hair, obviously, had just been combed, but one strand of hair went down over the middle of his wide forehead. His plump white neck protruded sharply from behind the black collar of his uniform; he smelled of cologne.

"«Весь план ордена должен быть основан на том, чтоб образовать людей твердых, добродетельных и связанных единством убеждения, убеждения, состоящего в том, чтобы везде и всеми силами преследовать порок и глупость и покровительствовать таланты и добродетель: извлекать из праха людей достойных, присоединяя их к нашему братству. Тогда только орден наш будет иметь власть — нечувствительно вязать руки покровителям беспорядка и управлять ими так, чтоб они того не примечали. Одним словом, надобно учредить всеобщий владычествующий образ правления, который распространялся бы над целым светом, не разрушая гражданских уз, и при коем все прочие правления могли бы продолжаться обыкновенным своим порядком и делать всё, кроме того только, что препятствует великой цели нашего ордена, то есть доставлению добродетели торжества над пороком. Сию цель предполагало само христианство. Оно учило людей быть мудрыми и добрыми, и для собственной своей выгоды следовать примеру и наставлениям лучших и мудрейших человеков.","“The entire plan of the order should be based on educating people who are firm, virtuous and bound by the unity of conviction, a conviction consisting in pursuing vice and stupidity everywhere and with all your might and patronizing talents and virtue: to extract worthy people from the dust, joining them to our brotherhood. Then only our order will have the power to insensitively bind the hands of the patrons of disorder and control them so that they do not notice it. In a word, it is necessary to establish a universal dominating form of government, which would extend over the whole world without destroying civil bonds, and under which all other governments could continue in their usual order and do everything except that only that hinders the great goal of our order, then is to bring virtue to triumph over vice. Christianity itself presupposed this goal.

Only then will our order have power— to bind imperceptibly the hands of those who condone disorder and rule them in such a way that they do not notice it. In short, a universal, sovereign form of government should be established, which will be spread over the whole world, without destroying civil bonds, and under which all other governments may continue in their usual way and do all except that which hinders the great goal of our order, that is, the achievement of the triumph of virtue over vice.

In a word, we must found a form of government holding universal sway, which should be diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship, and beside which all other governments can continue in their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great aim of our Order, which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice. This aim was that of Christianity itself. It taught men to be wise and good, and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest men."

"— Нет, тут ничего не сделаешь, — подумал Ростов, опустив глаза, и хотел уже выходить, но с правой стороны он чувствовал устремленный на себя значительный взгляд и оглянулся на него. Почти в самом углу на шинели сидел с желтым, как скелет, худым, строгим лицом и небритой седой бородой, старый солдат и упорно смотрел на Ростова. С одной стороны, сосед старого солдата что-то шептал ему, указывая на Ростова. Ростов понял, что старик намерен о чем-то просить его. Он подошел ближе и увидал, что у старика была согнута только одна нога, а другой совсем не было выше колена. Другой сосед старика, неподвижно лежавший с закинутой головой, довольно далеко от него, был молодой солдат с восковой бледностью на курносом, покрытом еще веснушками, лице и с закаченными под веки глазами. Ростов поглядел на курносого солдата, и мороз пробежал по его спине.","“No, you can’t do anything here,” thought Rostov, lowering his eyes, and was about to go out, but on the right side he felt a significant look fixed on himself and looked back at him. Almost in the very corner, on an overcoat, with a skeleton-yellow, thin, stern face and an unshaven gray beard, an old soldier was sitting and staring stubbornly at Rostov. On the one hand, the old soldier's neighbor whispered something to him, pointing to Rostov. Rostov realized that the old man intended to ask him for something. He came closer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent, and the other was not at all above the knee. Another neighbor of the old man, who lay motionless with his head thrown back, quite far from him, was a young soldier with a waxy pallor on a snub-nosed face, still covered with freckles, and with eyes rolled under the eyelids. Rostov looked at the snub-nosed soldier, and a frost ran down his back.","“No, there's nothing to be done here,” thought Rostov, lowering his eyes, and he was already about to leave, but he felt a meaningful gaze directed at him from the right and turned to look. Almost in the corner, on an overcoat, sat an old soldier with a yellow, stern face, gaunt as a skeleton's, and an unshaven gray beard, looking fixedly at Rostov. The old soldier's neighbor on one side was whispering something to him, pointing at Rostov. Rostov understood that the old man meant to ask him something. He went closer and saw that only one of the old man's legs was bent under him; the other was missing above the knee. The old man's other neighbor, who lay without moving, his head thrown back, some distance from him, was a young soldier with a waxen pallor on his snub-nosed, still freckled face, and only the whites of his eyes showing. Rostov looked at this snub-nosed soldier and a chill ran down his spine.","‘No, it’s impossible to do anything here,’ thought Rostov, lowering his eyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an intense look fixed on him on his right, and he turned. Close to the corner, on an overcoat, sat an old unshaven grey-bearded soldier as thin as a skeleton, with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on Rostov. The man’s neighbour on one side whispered something to him, pointing at Rostov, who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him. He drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him, the other had been amputated above the knee. His neighbour on the other side, who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back, was a young soldier with a snub nose. His pale waxen face was still freckled, and his eyes were rolled back. Rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his back."
"«Что он говорит?» подумал князь Андрей. «Да, об весне верно, подумал он, оглядываясь по сторонам. И то зелено всё уже… как скоро! И береза, и черемуха, и ольха уж начинает… А дуб и не заметно.

"Ростов долго стоял у угла, издалека глядя на пирующих. В уме его происходила мучительная работа, которую он никак не мог довести до конца. В душе поднимались страшные сомнения.

Ему так живо казалось, что он теперь чувствует этот больничный запах мертвого тела, что он оглядывался, чтобы понять, откуда мог происходить этот запах.

"Пьер после сватовства князя Андрея и Наташи, без всякой очевидной причины, вдруг почувствовал невозможность продолжать прежнюю жизнь. Как ни твердо он был убежден в истинах, открытых ему его благодетелем, как ни радостно ему было то первое время увлечения внутренней работой самосовершенствования, которой он предался с таким жаром, после помолвки князя Андрея с Наташей и после смерти Иосифа Алексеевича, о которой он получил известие почти в то же время, — вся прелесть этой прежней жизни вдруг пропала для него. Остался один остов жизни: его дом с блестящею женой, пользовавшеюся теперь милостями одного важного лица, знакомство со всем Петербургом и служба с скучными формальностями. И эта прежняя жизнь вдруг с неожиданной мерзостью представилась Пьеру. Он перестал писать свой дневник, избегал общества братьев, стал опять ездить в клуб, стал опять много пить, опять сблизился с холостыми компаниями и начал вести такую жизнь, что графиня Елена Васильевна сочла нужным сделать ему строгое замечание.

"Неожиданное известие о переходе французами Немана было особенно неожиданно после месяца несбывавшегося ожидания, и на бале!

"Наташе показалось оскорбительно это семейное сближение здесь, на бале, как будто не было другого места для семейных разговоров, кроме как на бале. Она не слушала и не смотрела на Веру, что-то говорившую ей про свое зеленое платье.","This family rapprochement here, at the ball, seemed insulting to Natasha, as if there was no other place for family conversations except at the ball.

"— Это совсем не то, — сказал он. — Разве это польская мазу'ка? А отлично танцует. — Зная, что Денисов и в Польше даже славился своим мастерством плясать польскую мазурку, Николай подбежал к Наташе:","“That's not it at all,” he said. ""Is that a Polish Mazu'ka?""

"У Иогеля были самые веселые балы в Москве. Это говорили матушки, глядя на своих adolescentes, [девушек, ] выделывающих свои только что выученные па; это говорили и сами adolescentes и adolescents, [девушки и юноши, ] танцовавшие до упаду; эти взрослые девицы и молодые люди, приезжавшие на эти балы с мыслию снизойти до них и находя в них самое лучшее веселье. В этот же год на этих балах сделалось два брака. Две хорошенькие княжны Горчаковы нашли женихов и вышли замуж, и тем еще более пустили в славу эти балы. Особенного на этих балах было то, что не было хозяина и хозяйки: был, как пух летающий, по правилам искусства расшаркивающийся, добродушный Иогель, который принимал билетики за уроки от всех своих гостей; было то, что на эти балы еще езжали только те, кто хотел танцовать и веселиться, как хотят этого 13-ти и 14-ти-летние девочки, в первый раз надевающие длинные платья. Все, за редкими исключениями, были или казались хорошенькими: так восторженно они все улыбались и так разгорались их глазки. Иногда танцовывали даже pas de chale лучшие ученицы, из которых лучшая была Наташа, отличавшаяся своею грациозностью; но на этом, последнем бале танцовали только экосезы, англезы и только что входящую в моду мазурку. Зала была взята Иогелем в дом Безухова, и бал очень удался, как говорили все. Много было хорошеньких девочек, и Ростовы барышни были из лучших. Они обе были особенно счастливы и веселы. В этот вечер Соня, гордая предложением Долохова, своим отказом и объяснением с Николаем, кружилась еще дома, не давая девушке дочесать свои косы, и теперь насквозь светилась порывистой радостью.","Iogel had the funniest balls in Moscow. This was said by the mothers, looking at their adolescentes [girls] doing their newly learned steps; this was said by the adolescentes and adolescents themselves, [girls and boys,] dancing until they dropped; these grown girls and young people who came to these balls with the idea of condescending to them and finding the best fun in them. In the same year, two marriages took place at these balls. Two pretty princesses Gorchakovs found suitors and got married, and all the more they let these balls into glory. What was special at these balls was that there was no host and hostess: there was, like fluff flying, bowing according to the rules of art, good-natured Yogel, who accepted tickets for lessons from all his guests; was that only those who wanted to dance and have fun, as 13- and 14-year-old girls who put on long dresses for the first time, still went to these balls. All, with rare exceptions, were or seemed pretty: they all smiled so enthusiastically and their eyes lit up so much. Sometimes the best students even danced pas de chale, of which the best was Natasha, distinguished by her grace; but at this, the last ball, only ecossaises, angleises and the mazurka, which was just coming into fashion, danced. The hall was taken by Yogel to Bezukhov's house, and the ball was a great success, as everyone said. There were many pretty girls, and the Rostov young ladies were among the best. Both of them were especially happy and cheerful. That evening, Sonya, proud of Dolokhov's proposal, her refusal and explanation with Nikolai, was still circling at home, not allowing the girl to comb her braids, and now shone through with impetuous joy.","The balls at Iogel's were the merriest in Moscow. Mothers said so, looking at their adolescentes performing their just-learned pas; the adolescentes and adolescents said so themselves, dancing until they dropped; grownup girls and young men said so, who came to these balls thinking they were condescending and found the best of merriment in them. That year two matches were made at these balls. The two pretty Gorchakov princesses found fiances and got married, and this added still more to the reputation of these balls. The particu-liarity of these balls was that there was no host or hostess; there was the good-natured Iogel, scraping the parquet by all the rules of art, flitting about like a bit of down, receiving tickets for lessons from his pupils;[101] another thing was that only those came to these balls who wanted to dance and be merry, the way thirteen- and fourteen-year-old girls do, who put on long gowns for the first time. All of them, with rare exceptions, were or seemed pretty: so rapturously they smiled, so lit-up were their eyes. Sometimes the best girl pupils even danced the pas de châle, and the best of them was Natasha, distinguished by her gracefulness; but at this last ball only the écossaise and the anglaise were danced, and the mazurka, which was just coming into fashion. Iogel rented the ballroom in Bezukhov's house, and the ball was very successful, as everyone said. There were many pretty girls, and the Rostov girls were among the best. They were both especially happy and gay that evening. Sonya, proud of Dolokhov's proposal, of her refusal, and of the talk with Nikolai, started twirling while she was still at home, not letting her maid do up her braids, and now she shone all through with impetuous joy.","IOGEL’S were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow. So said the mothers as they watched their adolescentes executing their newly-learned steps, and so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they were ready to drop, and so said the grown-up young men and women who came to these balls with an air of condescension, and found them most enjoyable. That year two marriages had come of these balls. The two pretty young Princesses Gorchakov met suitors there and were married, and so further increased the fame of these dances. What distinguished them from others was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of the good-natured Iogel, flying about like a feather and bowing according to the rules of his art, as he collected the tickets from all his visitors. There was the fact that only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for the first time. With scarcely any exceptions they all were, or seemed to be, pretty—so rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes. Sometimes the best of the pupils, of whom Natasha, who was exceptionally graceful, was first, even danced the pas de châle, but at this last ball only the écossaise, the anglaise, and the mazurka which was just coming into fashion, were danced. Iogel had taken a ballroom in Bezukhov’s house, and the ball, as everyone said, was a great success. There were many pretty girls and the Rostov girls were among the prettiest. They were both particularly happy and gay. That evening, proud of Dolokhov’s proposal, her refusal, and her explanation with Nikolai, Sonya twirled about before she left home so that the maid could hardly get her hair braided, and was transparently radiant with impulsive joy."

"В дверях передней показался Багратион, без шляпы и шпаги, которые он, по клубному обычаю, оставил у швейцара. Он был не в смушковом картузе с нагайкой через плечо, как видел его Ростов в ночь накануне Аустерлицкого сражения, а в новом узком мундире с русскими и иностранными орденами и с георгиевской звездой на левой стороне груди. Он видимо сейчас, перед обедом, подстриг волосы и бакенбарды, что невыгодно изменяло его физиономию. На лице его было что-то наивно-праздничное, дававшее, в соединении с его твердыми, мужественными чертами, даже несколько-комическое выражение его лицу. Беклешов и Федор Петрович Уваров, приехавшие с ним вместе, остановились в дверях, желая, чтобы он, как главный гость, прошел вперед их. Багратион смешался, не желая воспользоваться их учтивостью; произошла остановка в дверях, и наконец Багратион всё-таки прошел вперед. Он шел, не зная куда девать руки, застенчиво и неловко, по паркету приемной: ему привычнее и легче было ходить под пулями по вспаханному полю, как он шел перед Курским полком в Шенграбене. Старшины встретили его у первой двери, сказав ему несколько слов о радости видеть столь дорогого гостя, и недождавшись его ответа, как бы завладев им, окружили его и повели в гостиную. В дверях гостиной не было возможности пройти от столпившихся членов и гостей, давивших друг друга и через плечи друг друга старавшихся, как редкого зверя, рассмотреть Багратиона. Граф Илья Андреич, энергичнее всех, смеясь и приговаривая: — пусти, mon cher, пусти, пусти, — протолкал толпу, провел гостей в гостиную и посадил на средний диван. Тузы, почетнейшие члены клуба, обступили вновь прибывших. Граф Илья Андреич, проталкиваясь опять через толпу, вышел из гостиной и с другим старшиной через минуту явился, неся большое серебряное блюдо, которое он поднес князю Багратиону. На блюде лежали сочиненные и напечатанные в честь героя стихи. Багратион, увидав блюдо, испуганно оглянулся, как бы отыскивая помощи. Но во всех глазах было требование того, чтобы он покорился. Чувствуя себя в их власти, Багратион решительно, обеими руками, взял блюдо и сердито, укоризненно посмотрел на графа, подносившего его. Кто-то услужливо вынул из рук Багратиона блюдо (а то бы он, казалось, намерен был держать его так до вечера и так итти к столу) и обратил его внимание на стихи. «Ну и прочту», как будто сказал Багратион и устремив усталые глаза на бумагу, стал читать с сосредоточенным и серьезным видом. Сам сочинитель взял стихи и стал читать. Князь Багратион склонил голову и слушал.","Bagration appeared at the entrance door, without his hat and sword, which, according to club custom, he had left with the porter. He was not in a fawn cap with a whip over his shoulder, as Rostov saw him on the night before the battle of Austerlitz, but in a new narrow uniform with Russian and foreign orders and with a St. George star on the left side of his chest. He apparently now, before dinner, cut his hair and sideburns, which unfavorably changed his physiognomy. There was something naively festive on his face, which, combined with his firm, masculine features, even gave a somewhat comical expression to his face. Bekleshov and Fyodor Petrovich Uvarov, who had come with him, stopped at the door, wishing that he, as the main guest, would go ahead of them. Bagration was confused, not wanting to take advantage of their courtesy; there was a stop at the door, and finally Bagration still went ahead. He walked, not knowing where to put his hands, shyly and awkwardly, along the parquet floor of the waiting room: it was more familiar and easier for him to walk under bullets on a plowed field, as he walked in front of the Kursk regiment in Shengraben. The foremen met him at the first door, saying a few words to him about the joy of seeing such a dear guest, and without waiting for his answer, as if taking possession of him, they surrounded him and led him into the living room. At the door of the living room it was impossible to get past the crowded members and guests, who pressed each other and over each other's shoulders tried, like a rare beast, to examine Bagration. Count Ilya Andreich, the most energetic of all, laughing and saying: ""Let me go, mon cher, let me go, let me go,"" pushed the crowd through, led the guests into the living room and seated them on the middle sofa. Aces, the most honorable members of the club, surrounded the new arrivals. Count Ilya Andreich, pushing his way through the crowd again, left the living room and appeared a minute later with another foreman, carrying a large silver dish, which he offered to Prince Bagration. On the dish were poems composed and printed in honor of the hero. Bagration, seeing the dish, looked around frightened, as if looking for help. But in all eyes there was a demand that he submit. Feeling himself in their power, Bagration resolutely, with both hands, took the dish and angrily, reproachfully looked at the count who was offering it. Someone obligingly took a dish out of Bagration's hands (otherwise he seemed to intend to keep it like that until evening and go to the table like that) and drew his attention to the verses. “Well, I’ll read it,” Bagration seemed to say, and fixing his tired eyes on the paper, he began to read with a concentrated and serious look. The writer himself took the poems and began to read. Prince Bagration bowed his head and listened.","In the doorway of the anteroom Bagration appeared, without his hat and sword, which, as was customary at the club, he had left with the doorman. He was not in an Astrakhan peaked cap, with a whip over his shoulder, as Rostov had seen him on the eve of the battle of Austerlitz, but in a trim new uniform with Russian and foreign decorations and the star of St. George on his left breast. He had evidently had his hair and side-whiskers trimmed just before the dinner, which changed his physiognomy to its disadvantage. On his face there was something naively festive, which, in combination with his firm, manly features, even gave his face a somewhat comical expression. Bekleshov and Fyo-dor Petrovich Uvarov, who came with him, stopped in the doorway, wishing him, as the main guest, to go ahead of them. Bagration was embarrassed, not wishing to take advantage of their courtesy; a pause in the doorway ensued, and Bagration finally did go ahead of them. He walked over the parquet of the reception hall bashfully and awkwardly, not knowing what to do with his hands; it was easier and more usual for him to walk under bullets over a plowed field, as he had walked ahead of the Kursky regiment at Schöngraben. The stewards met him at the first door, spoke a few words to him about the joy of seeing such a dear guest, and, not waiting for him to reply, and as if taking possession of him, surrounded him and led him to the drawing room. It was impossible to go through the door of the drawing room because of the thronging members and guests, who pressed against each other, trying to get a glimpse of Bagration, as of a rare animal, over each other's shoulders. Count Ilya Andreich—more energetically than anyone, laughing and repeating, “Allow me, mon cher, allow me, allow me!”—pushed through the crowd, led the guests to the drawing room, and seated them on the middle sofa. The aces, the club's most respected members, stood around the new arrivals. Count Ilya Andreich, again pushing through the crowd, left the drawing room and came back a moment later with another steward, carrying a large silver platter, which he offered to Prince Bagration. On the platter lay verses composed and printed in honor of the hero. Seeing the platter, Bagration glanced fearfully around, as if looking for help. But all eyes were demanding that he submit. Feeling himself in their power, Bagration resolutely took the platter in both hands and looked angrily and reproachfully at the count who had offered it to him. Someone obligingly took the platter from Bagration's hands (otherwise he seemed prepared to hold it that way till evening and go to the table with it), and drew his attention to the verses. “Well, so I'll read them,” Bagration seemed to say, and, fixing his weary eyes on the paper, he began to read with a concentrated and serious look. The author himself took the verses from him and began to read. Prince Bagration inclined his head and listened.","Bagration appeared in the doorway of the ante-room without hat or sword, which in accord with the Club custom he had given up to the hall-porter. He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded whip over his shoulder, as when Rostov had seen him on the eve of the battle of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign Orders, and the Star of St George on his left breast. Evidently just before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed, which changed his appearance for the worse. There was something naively festive in his air, which in conjunction with his firm and virile features gave him a rather comical expression. Bekleshov and Fyodor Uvarov who had arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him, as the guest of honour, to enter first. Bagration was embarrassed, not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy, and this caused some delay at the doors, but after all he did at last enter first. He walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception-room not knowing what to do with his hands; he was more accustomed to walk over a ploughed field under fire, as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at Schön Grabern—and he would have found that easier. The committee-men met him at the first door and expressing their delight at seeing such a highly honoured guest, took possession of him as it were, without waiting for his reply, surrounded him, and led him to the drawing-room. It was at first impossible to enter the drawing-room door for the crowd of members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at Bagration over each other’s shoulders, as if he were some rare animal. Count Ilya Andreich, laughing and repeating the words, ‘Make way, mon cher! Make way, make way!’ pushed through the crowd more energetically than anyone, led the guests into the drawing-room, and seated them on the centre sofa. The bigwigs, the most respected members of the Club, beset the new arrivals. Count Ilya Andreich again thrusting his way through the crowd, went out of the drawing-room, and reappeared a minute later with another committee-man, carrying a large silver salver which he presented to Prince Bagration. On the salver lay some verses composed and printed in the hero’s honour. Bagration on seeing the salver glanced around in dismay, as though seeking help. But all eyes demanded that he should submit. Feeling himself in their power, he resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him. Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagration (or he would, it seemed, have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it) and drew his attention to the verses. ‘Well, I will read them, then!’ Bagration seemed to say, and fixing his weary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and serious expression. But the author himself took the verses and began reading them aloud. Bagration bowed his head and listened:"

"— Bien faite et la beaute du diable, [Хорошо сложена и красота молодости, ] — говорил этот человек и увидав Ростова перестал говорить и нахмурился.","- Bien faite et la beaute du diable, [The beauty of youth is well built,] - this man said, and when he saw Rostov, he stopped talking and frowned.","“Bien faite et la beauté du diable,”[331] this man was saying, and, seeing Rostov, he stopped speaking and frowned.","‘Bien faite et la beauté du diable,’1 he was saying, but on seeing Rostov he stopped short and frowned."
"Едва Ростов успел передать письмо и рассказать всё дело Денисова, как с лестницы застучали быстрые шаги со шпорами и генерал, отойдя от него, подвинулся к крыльцу. Господа свиты государя сбежали с лестницы и пошли к лошадям. Берейтор Эне, тот самый, который был в Аустерлице, подвел лошадь государя, и на лестнице послышался легкий скрип шагов, которые сейчас узнал Ростов. Забыв опасность быть узнанным, Ростов подвинулся с несколькими любопытными из жителей к самому крыльцу и опять, после двух лет, он увидал те же обожаемые им черты, то же лицо, тот же взгляд, ту же походку, то же соединение величия и кротости… И чувство восторга и любви к государю с прежнею силою воскресло в душе Ростова. Государь в Преображенском мундире, в белых лосинах и высоких ботфортах, с звездой, которую не знал Ростов (это была legion d'honneur) [звезда почетного легиона] вышел на крыльцо, держа шляпу под рукой и надевая перчатку. Он остановился, оглядываясь и всё освещая вокруг себя своим взглядом. Кое-кому из генералов он сказал несколько слов. Он узнал тоже бывшего начальника дивизии Ростова, улыбнулся ему и подозвал его к себе.","As soon as Rostov had time to hand over the letter and tell the whole story of Denisov, quick steps with spurs pounded from the stairs and the general, moving away from him, moved to the porch. The gentlemen of the sovereign's retinue ran down the stairs and went to the horses. The landlord Ene, the same one who was in Austerlitz, led the sovereign's horse, and a slight creak of steps was heard on the stairs, which Rostov now recognized. Forgetting the danger of being recognized, Rostov moved with several curious residents to the very porch and again, after two years, he saw the same features he adored, the same face, the same look, the same gait, the same combination of greatness and meekness ... And a feeling of delight and love for the sovereign with the same strength resurrected in the soul of Rostov. The sovereign in the uniform of the Transfiguration, in white leggings and high boots, with a star that Rostov did not know (it was a legion d'honneur) [star of the Legion of Honor] went out onto the porch, holding his hat under his arm and putting on a glove. He stopped, looking around and illuminating everything around him with his gaze. He said a few words to some of the generals. He also recognized the former head of the division, Rostov, smiled at him and called him to him.","Rostov barely had time to hand him the letter and tell him all about Deni-sov's case before the sound of quick footsteps with spurs was heard from the stairway, and the general, leaving him, moved towards the porch. The gentlemen of the sovereign's suite ran down the steps and went to their horses. The groom Hayne, the same one who had been at Austerlitz, led up the sovereign's horse, and from the stairs came a light creak of footsteps which Rostov knew at once. Forgetting the danger of being recognized, Rostov, with some curious townsfolk, moved close to the porch and again, after two years, saw the same adored features, the same face, the same gaze, the same gait, the same combination of majesty and mildness ... And the feeling of rapture and love for the sovereign rose again with its old force in Rostov's soul. The sovereign, in the Preobrazhensky tunic, white buckskin breeches, and high top boots, with a star Rostov did not know (it was the Légion d'honneur), came out to the porch, holding his hat under his arm and putting on a glove. He stopped, looked about, and illuminated everything around him with his gaze. He spoke a few words to one of the generals. He also recognized the former commander of Rostov's division, smiled to him, and called him over.","Hardly had Rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining Denisov’s case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the porch. The gentlemen of the Emperor’s suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at Austerlitz, led up the Emperor’s horse, and the faint creak of a footstep Rostov knew at once, was heard on the stairs. Forgetting the danger of being recognized, Rostov went close to the porch together with some inquisitive civilians, and again after two years saw those features he adored: that same face and same look and step, and the same union of majesty and mildness … And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in Rostov’s soul in all its old force. In the uniform of the Preobrazhensky regiment—white chamois-leather breeches and high boots—and wearing a star Rostov did not know (it was that of the Légion d’honneur), the monarch came out into the porch, putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm. He stopped and looked about him, brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a few words to some of the generals, and recognizing the former commander of Rostov’s division smiled and beckoned to him."

"— Что же, — сказал Пьер, всё так же улыбаясь. — Становилось страшно. Очевидно было, что дело, начавшееся так легко, уже ничем не могло быть предотвращено, что оно шло само собою, уже независимо от воли людей, и должно было совершиться. Денисов первый вышел вперед до барьера и провозгласил:","“Well,” said Pierre, still smiling. - It was getting scary. It was obvious that the deed, which began so easily, could no longer be prevented by anything, that it went on by itself, already independently of the will of people, and had to be accomplished. Denisov was the first to come forward to the barrier and proclaimed:","“Let's,” said Pierre, with the same smile. It was becoming frightening. It was obvious that the affair, having begun so lightly, could no longer be prevented by anything, that it was going on by itself, independently of men's will, and would be accomplished.

"Дома еще не спали. Молодежь дома Ростовых, воротившись из театра, поужинав, сидела у клавикорд. Как только Николай вошел в залу, его охватила та любовная, поэтическая атмосфера, которая царствовала в эту зиму в их доме и которая теперь, после предложения Долохова и бала Иогеля, казалось, еще более сгустилась, как воздух перед грозой, над Соней и Наташей. Соня и Наташа в голубых платьях, в которых они были в театре, хорошенькие и знающие это, счастливые, улыбаясь, стояли у клавикорд. Вера с Шиншиным играла в шахматы в гостиной. Старая графиня, ожидая сына и мужа, раскладывала пасьянс с старушкой-дворянкой, жившей у них в доме. Денисов с блестящими глазами и взъерошенными волосами сидел, откинув ножку назад, у клавикорд, и хлопая по ним своими коротенькими пальцами, брал аккорды, и закатывая глаза, своим маленьким, хриплым, но верным голосом, пел сочиненное им стихотворение «Волшебница», к которому он пытался найти музыку.","Haven't slept at home yet. The youth of the Rostovs' house, having returned from the theatre, had supper, sat at the clavichord. As soon as Nikolai entered the hall, he was seized by that loving, poetic atmosphere that reigned that winter in their house and which now, after Dolokhov's proposal and Yogel's ball, seemed to thicken even more, like the air before a thunderstorm, over Sonya and Natasha. Sonya and Natasha, in the blue dresses they wore at the theatre, pretty and knowing it, were happy and smiling at the clavichord. Vera and Shinshin were playing chess in the living room. The old countess, expecting her son and husband, was playing solitaire with an old noblewoman who lived in their house. Denisov, with shining eyes and disheveled hair, was sitting with his leg thrown back at the clavichord, and clapping his short fingers on them, he took chords, and rolling his eyes, in his small, hoarse, but true voice, sang the poem he had composed ""The Sorceress"", to which he tried to find music.","At home no one was asleep. The young people of the Rostovs' house, having come back from the theater and had supper, were sitting by the clavichord. As soon as Nikolai came into the reception room, he was enveloped by that amorous, poetic atmosphere which had prevailed in their house that winter and which now, after Dolokhov's proposal and Iogel's ball, seemed to thicken still more, like the air before a thunderstorm, over Sonya and Natasha. Sonya and Natasha, in the light blue dresses they had worn to the theater, pretty and knowing it, happy, smiling, stood by the clavichord. Vera and Shinshin were playing chess in the drawing room. The old countess, waiting for her son and husband, was playing patience with an old gentlewoman who lived in their house. Denisov, eyes shining and hair disheveled, was sitting, his leg thrust back, at the clavichord, banging out chords on it with his stubby fingers and, his eyes rolling, was singing in his small, hoarse, but true voice some verses of his own composition, “The Sorceress,” which he was trying to set to music.","At home they had not yet gone to bed. The young people after returning from the theatre had had supper, and were grouped round the clavichord. As soon as Nikolai entered he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere of love which pervaded the Rostov household that winter, and now after Dolokhov’s proposal and Iogel’s ball seemed to have grown thicker round Sonya and Natasha as the air does before a thunderstorm. Sonya and Natasha in the light blue dresses they had worn at the theatre, looking pretty and conscious of it, were standing by the clavichord happy and smiling. Vera was playing chess with Shinshin in the drawing-room. The old countess, waiting for the return of her husband and son, sat playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house. Denisov, with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord striking chords with his short fingers, his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling as he sang, with his small, husky, but true voice, some verses called ‘Enchantress’ which he had composed, and to which he was trying to fit music. ‘Enchantress say, to my forsaken lyre"

"— Волшебница всё со мной сделает! — сказал Денисов и отстегнул саблю. Он вышел из-за стульев, крепко взял за руку свою даму, приподнял голову и отставил ногу, ожидая такта. Только на коне и в мазурке не видно было маленького роста Денисова, и он представлялся тем самым молодцом, каким он сам себя чувствовал. Выждав такт, он с боку, победоносно и шутливо, взглянул на свою даму, неожиданно пристукнул одной ногой и, как мячик, упруго отскочил от пола и полетел вдоль по кругу, увлекая за собой свою даму. Он не слышно летел половину залы на одной ноге, и, казалось, не видел стоявших перед ним стульев и прямо несся на них; но вдруг, прищелкнув шпорами и расставив ноги, останавливался на каблуках, стоял так секунду, с грохотом шпор стучал на одном месте ногами, быстро вертелся и, левой ногой подщелкивая правую, опять летел по кругу. Наташа угадывала то, что он намерен был сделать, и, сама не зная как, следила за ним — отдаваясь ему. То он кружил ее, то на правой, то на левой руке, то падая на колена, обводил ее вокруг себя, и опять вскакивал и пускался вперед с такой стремительностью, как будто он намерен был, не переводя духа, перебежать через все комнаты; то вдруг опять останавливался и делал опять новое и неожиданное колено. Когда он, бойко закружив даму перед ее местом, щелкнул шпорой, кланяясь перед ней, Наташа даже не присела ему. Она с недоуменьем уставила на него глаза, улыбаясь, как будто не узнавая его. — Что ж это такое? — проговорила она.","""The sorceress will do anything to me!"" - said Denisov and unfastened his saber. He stepped out from behind the chairs, firmly took his lady by the hand, lifted his head and put his foot aside, expecting tact. Only on a horse and in a mazurka was Denisov's small stature not visible, and he seemed to be the same fine fellow as he himself felt. After waiting for a beat, he looked at his lady from the side, victoriously and jokingly, unexpectedly tapped with one foot and, like a ball, rebounded resiliently from the floor and flew along in a circle, dragging his lady with him. He silently flew half the hall on one leg, and it seemed that he did not see the chairs standing in front of him and rushed straight at them; but suddenly, snapping his spurs and spreading his legs, he stopped on his heels, stood like that for a second, with a clatter of spurs, his feet tapped in one place, quickly turned around and, snapping his left foot with his right, again flew in a circle. Natasha guessed what he intended to do, and, not knowing how herself, followed him - surrendering to him. Now he circled her, then on his right, then on his left hand, then falling to his knees, circled her around him, and again jumped up and rushed forward with such swiftness, as if he intended, without taking a breath, to run across all the rooms; then he would suddenly stop again and make another new and unexpected knee. When he, briskly circling the lady in front of her seat, snapped his spur, bowing in front of her, Natasha did not even sit down to him. She fixed her eyes on him in bewilderment, smiling as if she did not recognize him. — What is it? she said.","said Denisov, and he unbuckled his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, took his lady firmly by the hand, threw back his head, and advanced his foot, waiting for the downbeat. Only on horseback and in the mazurka did Denisov's small stature not show, and he looked like the fine fellow he felt himself to be. On the downbeat, he gave his lady a victorious and jocular sidelong look, unexpectedly stamped his foot, bounced off the floor springily, like a ball, and flew along in a circle, drawing his lady after him. He flew inaudibly across half the room on one leg, and, seeming not to see the chairs that stood before him, raced straight for them; but suddenly, clanking his spurs and spreading his legs, he stopped on his heels, paused like that for a second, tapped his feet in place with a clanking of spurs, spun quickly, then, tapping his right ankle with his left foot, again flew along in a circle. Natasha intuitively guessed what he was about to do and, not knowing how herself, followed him—giving herself to him. Now he twirled her on his right arm, now on his left, now he fell on his knees and led her around him, then jumped up and sped on as precipitously as if he intended to run through all the rooms without pausing for breath; now he suddenly stopped again and performed a new and unexpected caper. When he swiftly twirled his lady in front of her seat and jingled his spurs before her as he bowed, Natasha did not even curtsey to him. She fixed her eyes on him in perplexity, smiling as though she did not recognize him. “What on earth is this?” she said.","She can do anything with me!’ said Denisov, and he unhooked his sabre. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his partner’s hand firmly, threw back his head and advanced his foot, waiting for the beat. Only on horseback and in the mazurka was Denisov’s short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he felt himself to be. At the right beat of the music he looked sideways at his partner with a merry and triumphant air, suddenly stamped with one foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew round the room taking his partner with him. He glided silently on one foot half across the room, and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them, when suddenly, clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs, he stopped short on his heels, stood so a second, stamped on the spot clanking his spurs, whirled rapidly round, and striking his left heel against his right, flew round again in a circle. Natasha guessed what he meant to do, and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing how. First he spun her round, holding her now with his left now with his right hand, then falling on one knee he twirled her round him, and again jumping up, dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath, and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps. When at last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair, he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, Natasha did not even make him a curtsey. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement, smiling as if she did not recognize him. ‘What is this?’ she brought out."

"— Где? — спросил Болконский. — Виноват, — сказал он, обращаясь к барону, — этот разговор мы в другом месте доведем до конца, а на бале надо танцовать. — Он вышел вперед, по направлению, которое ему указывал Пьер. Отчаянное, замирающее лицо Наташи бросилось в глаза князю Андрею. Он узнал ее, угадал ее чувство, понял, что она была начинающая, вспомнил ее разговор на окне и с веселым выражением лица подошел к графине Ростовой.","- Where? Bolkonsky asked. “Excuse me,” he said, turning to the baron, “we will finish this conversation in another place, but at the ball we have to dance.” - He stepped forward, in the direction that Pierre indicated to him.

He recognized her, guessed her feelings, realized that she was a beginner, remembered her conversation at the window, and with a cheerful expression approached Countess Rostova.","“Where?” asked Bolkonsky. “I beg your pardon,” he said, turning to the baron, “we can finish this conversation elsewhere—at a ball one must dance.” He stepped forward, in the direction Pierre had indicated to him. Natasha's desperate, rapt face caught Prince Andrei's eye. He recognized her, guessed her feeling, realized that she was a débutante, remembered her conversation on the window ledge, and with a merry expression on his face went up to Countess Rostov.","Ask her,’ he said. ‘Where is she?’ asked Bolkonsky. ‘Excuse me!’ he added, turning to the baron, ‘we will finish this conversation elsewhere—at a ball one must dance.’ He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated. The despairing, dejected expression of Natasha’s face caught his eye. He recognized her, guessed her feelings, saw that it was her first ball, remembered her conversation at the window, and with an expression of pleasure on his face approached Countess Rostova."
"— Я не во время кажется, — сказал он, — я бы не приехал, но мне дело есть, — сказал он холодно…","“I don’t seem to be on time,” he said, “I wouldn’t come, but I have a business,” he said coldly ...","“It seems I chose the wrong time,” he said. “I wouldn't have come, but I'm on business,” he said coldly ...","‘I’ve come at a bad time I think.

Pendant cet interrègne, nous commençons un plan de manoeuvres excessivement intéressant et original. Notre but ne consiste pas, comme il devrait l'être, à éviter ou à attaquer l'ennemi; mais uniquement à éviter le général Boukshevden , qui par droit d'ancienneté serait notre chef. Nous poursuivons ce but avec tant d'énergie, que même en passant une rivière qui n'est pas guéable, nous brûlons les ponts pour nous séparer de notre ennemi, qui pour le moment, n'est pas Bonaparte, mais Boukshevden. Le général Boukshevden a manqué d'être attaqué et pris par des forces ennemies supérieures à cause d'une de nos belles manoeuvres qui nous sauvait de lui. Boukshevden nous poursuit—nous filons. A peine passe-t-il de notre côté de la rivière, que nous repassons de l'autre, en la fin notre ennemi Boukshevden nous attrappe et s'attaque à nous. Les deux généraux se fâchent. Il y a même une provocation en duel de la part de Boukshevden et une attaque d'épilepsie de la part de Bennigsen. Mais au moment critique le courrier, qui porte la nouvelle de notre victoire de Poultousk, nous apporte de Pétersbourg notre nomination de général en chef, et le premier ennemi Boukshevden est enfoncé: nous pouvons penser au second, à Bonaparte. Mais ne voilà-t-il pas qu'a ce moment se lève devant nous un troisième ennemi, c'est les Orthodox Armed Forces qui demande à grands cris du pain, de la viande, des souchary, du foin—que sais-je! Les magasins sont vides, les chemins impraticables. Les Orthodox Armed Forces se met à la maraude, et d'une manière dont la dernière campagne ne peut vous donner la moindre idée. La moitié des régiments forme des troupes libres, qui parcourent la contrée en mettant tout à feu et à sang. Les habitants sont ruinés de fond en comble, les hôpitaux regorgent de malades, et la disette est partout. Deux fois le quartier général a été attaqué par des troupes de maraudeurs et le général en chef a été obligé lui-même de demander un bataillon , pour les chasser. Dans une de ces attaques on m'a emporté ma malle vide et ma robe de chambre. L'Empereur veut donner droit à tous les chefs de division de fusiller les maraudeurs, mais je crains fort que cela n'oblige une moitié de l'armée de fusiller l'autre.","Voilà le premier acte. Aux suivants l’intérêt et le ridiculement comme de raison. Après le départ du maréchal il se trouve que nous sommes en vue de l’ennemi, et qu’il faut livrer bataille. Boukshevden est général en chef par droit d’ancienneté, mais le général Bennigsen n’est pas de cet avis, d’autant plus qu’il est lui, avec son corps en vue de l’ennemi , et qu’il veut profiter de l’occasion d’une bataille ‘aus eigener Hand’ comme dissent les Allemands. Il la donne. C’est la bataille de Poultousk qui est sensée être une grande victoire , mais qui à mon avis ne l’est pas du tout. Nous autres pékins avons comme vous savez, une très vilaine habitude de décider du gain ou de la perte d’une bataille. Celui qui s’est retire après la bataille, l’a perdu, voilà ce que nous disons, et à titre nous avons perdu la bataille, mais nous envoyons un courrier à Pétersbourg, qui porte les nouvelles d’une victoire, et le général ne cède pas le commandement en chef à Boukshevden, espérant recevoir de Pétersbourg en reconnaissance de sa victoire le titre de général en chef.

"— Он есть, но понять Его трудно, — заговорил опять масон, глядя не на лицо Пьера, а перед собою, своими старческими руками, которые от внутреннего волнения не могли оставаться спокойными, перебирая листы книги. — Ежели бы это был человек, в существовании которого ты бы сомневался, я бы привел к тебе этого человека, взял бы его за руку и показал тебе. Но как я, ничтожный смертный, покажу всё всемогущество, всю вечность, всю благость Его тому, кто слеп, или тому, кто закрывает глаза, чтобы не видать, не понимать Его, и не увидать, и не понять всю свою мерзость и порочность? — Он помолчал. — Кто ты? Что ты? Ты мечтаешь о себе, что ты мудрец, потому что ты мог произнести эти кощунственные слова, — сказал он с мрачной и презрительной усмешкой, — а ты глупее и безумнее малого ребенка, который бы, играя частями искусно сделанных часов, осмелился бы говорить, что, потому что он не понимает назначения этих часов, он и не верит в мастера, который их сделал. Познать Его трудно… Мы веками, от праотца Адама и до наших дней, работаем для этого познания и на бесконечность далеки от достижения нашей цели; но в непонимании Его мы видим только нашу слабость и Его величие… — Пьер, с замиранием сердца, блестящими глазами глядя в лицо масона, слушал его, не перебивал, не спрашивал его, а всей душой верил тому, что говорил ему этот чужой человек. Верил ли он тем разумным доводам, которые были в речи масона, или верил, как верят дети интонациям, убежденности и сердечности, которые были в речи масона, дрожанию голоса, которое иногда почти прерывало масона, или этим блестящим, старческим глазам, состарившимся на том же убеждении, или тому спокойствию, твердости и знанию своего назначения, которые светились из всего существа масона, и которые особенно сильно поражали его в сравнении с своей опущенностью и безнадежностью; — но он всей душой желал верить, и верил, и испытывал радостное чувство успокоения, обновления и возвращения к жизни.","“He exists, but it is difficult to understand Him,” the freemason spoke again, looking not at Pierre’s face, but in front of him, with his old hands, which, from inner excitement, could not remain calm, sorting through the pages of the book. “If it were a person whose existence you would doubt, I would bring this person to you, take him by the hand and show you. But how can I, an insignificant mortal, show all omnipotence, all eternity, all His goodness to the one who is blind, or to the one who closes his eyes so as not to see, not to understand Him, and not to see, and not to understand all his abomination and depravity? He paused. - Who are you? What you? You dream of yourself that you are a wise man, because you could utter these blasphemous words,” he said with a gloomy and contemptuous smile, “and you are more stupid and madder than a little child who, playing with parts of an artfully made watch, would dare to say that , because he does not understand the purpose of these hours, he does not believe in the master who made them. It is difficult to know Him... We have been working for this knowledge for centuries, from the forefather Adam to the present day, and we are infinitely far from achieving our goal; but in our misunderstanding of Him, we see only our weakness and His greatness ... - Pierre, with a sinking heart, looking with shining eyes into the face of the Mason, listened to him, did not interrupt, did not ask him, but with all his heart believed what this stranger told him. Did he believe in those reasonable arguments that were in the Mason's speech, or did he believe, as children believe, in the intonation, conviction and cordiality that were in the Mason's speech, the trembling of the voice, which sometimes almost interrupted the Mason, or these brilliant, senile eyes, grown old on that the same conviction, or that calmness, firmness and knowledge of one's purpose, which shone from the whole being of the Mason, and which struck him especially strongly in comparison with their omission and hopelessness; - but with all his heart he wanted to believe, and believed, and experienced a joyful feeling of calm, renewal and return to life.","“He exists, but it is hard to understand Him,” the Mason spoke again, not looking at Pierre's face, but straight ahead, leafing through his book with his old man's hands, which could not remain still because of his inner turmoil. “If you doubted the existence of some man, I would bring this man to you, I would take him by the hand and show him to you. But how can I, an insignificant mortal, show all His almightiness, all His eternity, all His goodness to one who is blind, or who closes his eyes so as not to see, not to understand his own loathsomeness and depravity?” He paused. “Who are you? What are you? You fancy that you're wise, because you were able to utter those blasphemous words,” he said with a gloomy and scornful smile, “but you are more foolish and mad than a little child who, playing with part of a skillfully made clock, would dare say that, since he does not understand the purpose of this clock, he does not believe in the master who made it. It is hard to know Him. For centuries, starting with our forefather Adam and down to our days, we have been working towards that knowledge and are infinitely far from reaching our goal; but we see our incomprehension only as our weakness and His grandeur...” With a swelling heart, with glittering eyes, Pierre gazed into the Mason's face, listened to him, did not interrupt him, did not ask anything, and believed with his whole soul what this stranger was telling him. Whether he believed those reasonable arguments in the Mason's speech, or believed, as children do, the intonations, convictions, and heartfelt emotion in the Mason's speech, the trembling of his voice, which sometimes almost interrupted him, or those glittering old man's eyes, grown old in that conviction, or the calmness, firmness, and knowledge of purpose which shone in the Mason's whole being and which struck him especially strongly, compared with his own slackness and hopelessness, in any case he wanted to believe with his whole soul, and did believe, and experienced a joyful feeling of peace, renewal, and return to life.","‘He exists, but to understand Him is hard,’ the mason began again, looking not at Pierre but straight before him, and turning the leaves of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep still. ‘If it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could bring him to thee, could take him by the hand and show him to thee. But how can I, an insignificant mortal, show His omnipotence, His infinity, and all His mercy to one who is blind, or who shuts his eyes that he may not see or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness and sinfulness?’ He paused again. ‘Who art thou? Thou dreamest that thou art wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words,’ he went on with a sombre and scornful smile. ‘ And thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a little child, who playing with the parts of a skilfully made watch dares to say that, as he does not understand its use, he does not believe in the master who made it. To know Him is hard … For ages, from our forefather Adam to our own day, we labour to attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim; but in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and His greatness …’ Pierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the mason’s face with shining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him but believing with his whole soul what the stranger said. Whether he accepted the wise reasoning contained in the mason’s words, or believed as a child believes, in the speaker’s tone of conviction and earnestness or the tremor of the speaker’s voice—which sometimes almost broke—or those brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction, or the calm firmness and certainty of his vocation, which radiated from his whole being (and which struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and hopelessness)—at any rate Pierre longed with his whole soul to believe and he did believe, and felt a joyful sense of comfort, regeneration, and return to life."

"«Проснулся поздно, читал Св. Писание, но был бесчувствен. После вышел и ходил по зале. Хотел размышлять, но вместо того воображение представило одно происшествие, бывшее четыре года тому назад. Господин Долохов, после моей дуэли встретясь со мной в Москве, сказал мне, что он надеется, что я пользуюсь теперь полным душевным спокойствием, несмотря на отсутствие моей супруги. Я тогда ничего не отвечал. Теперь я припомнил все подробности этого свидания и в душе своей говорил ему самые злобные слова и колкие ответы. Опомнился и бросил эту мысль только тогда, когда увидал себя в распалении гнева; но недостаточно раскаялся в этом. После пришел Борис Друбецкой и стал рассказывать разные приключения; я же с самого его прихода сделался недоволен его посещением и сказал ему что-то противное. Он возразил. Я вспыхнул и наговорил ему множество неприятного и даже грубого. Он замолчал и я спохватился только тогда, когда было уже поздно. Боже мой, я совсем не умею с ним обходиться. Этому причиной мое самолюбие. Я ставлю себя выше его и потому делаюсь гораздо его хуже, ибо он снисходителен к моим грубостям, а я напротив того питаю к нему презрение. Боже мой, даруй мне в присутствии его видеть больше мою мерзость и поступать так, чтобы и ему это было полезно. После обеда заснул и в то время как засыпал, услыхал явственно голос, сказавший мне в левое ухо: — „Твой день“.","“Woke up late, read the Holy Scriptures, but was insensible.

Now I recalled all the details of this meeting, and in my soul spoke to him the most spiteful words and sharp replies. He came to his senses and gave up this thought only when he saw himself inflamed with anger; but did not repent of it enough. After that, Boris Drubetskoy came and began to tell various adventures; but I, from his very arrival, became dissatisfied with his visit and said something contrary to him. He objected. I flared up and said a lot of unpleasant and even rude things to him. He fell silent and I caught myself only when it was already too late. My God, I can't deal with him at all. This is due to my ego. I put myself above him and therefore become much worse than him, for he is indulgent towards my rudeness, and on the contrary, I have contempt for him.

"Жюли уже давно ожидала предложенья от своего меланхолического обожателя и готова была принять его; но какое-то тайное чувство отвращения к ней, к ее страстному желанию выйти замуж, к ее ненатуральности, и чувство ужаса перед отречением от возможности настоящей любви еще останавливало Бориса. Срок его отпуска уже кончался. Целые дни и каждый божий день он проводил у Карагиных, и каждый день, рассуждая сам с собою, Борис говорил себе, что он завтра сделает предложение. Но в присутствии Жюли, глядя на ее красное лицо и подбородок, почти всегда осыпанный пудрой, на ее влажные глаза и на выражение лица, изъявлявшего всегдашнюю готовность из меланхолии тотчас же перейти к неестественному восторгу супружеского счастия, Борис не мог произнести решительного слова: несмотря на то, что он уже давно в воображении своем считал себя обладателем пензенских и нижегородских имений и распределял употребление с них доходов. Жюли видела нерешительность Бориса и иногда ей приходила мысль, что она противна ему; но тотчас же женское самообольщение представляло ей утешение, и она говорила себе, что он застенчив только от любви. Меланхолия ее однако начинала переходить в раздражительность, и не задолго перед отъездом Бориса, она предприняла решительный план. В то самое время как кончался срок отпуска Бориса, в Москве и, само собой разумеется, в гостиной Карагиных, появился Анатоль Курагин, и Жюли, неожиданно оставив меланхолию, стала очень весела и внимательна к Курагину.","Julie had long been expecting an offer from her melancholic admirer and was ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of disgust for her, for her passionate desire to get married, for her unnaturalness, and a feeling of horror at the renunciation of the possibility of true love still stopped Boris. His vacation was already over. Whole days and every single day he spent with the Karagins, and every day, reasoning with himself, Boris told himself that he would propose tomorrow. But in the presence of Julie, looking at her red face and chin, almost always sprinkled with powder, at her moist eyes and at the expression on her face, which always showed readiness to immediately move from melancholy to the unnatural delight of marital happiness, Boris could not utter a decisive word: despite the fact that for a long time in his imagination he considered himself the owner of the Penza and Nizhny Novgorod estates and distributed the use of income from them. Julie saw Boris's indecisiveness and sometimes the thought came to her that she was disgusting to him; but immediately a woman's self-delusion offered her consolation, and she told herself that he was shy only out of love. Her melancholy, however, began to turn into irritability, and not long before Boris left, she undertook a decisive plan. At the same time that Boris' vacation was coming to an end, Anatole Kuragin appeared in Moscow and, of course, in the Karagins' living room, and Julie, suddenly leaving her melancholy, became very cheerful and attentive to Kuragin.","Julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy admirer and was prepared to accept it; but some secret feeling of aversion for her, for her passionate desire to get married, for her unnaturalness, and a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of true love, still stopped Boris.

Julie saw Boris's irresolution, and the thought sometimes occurred to her that she repulsed him; but at once her feminine self-deception furnished her with a consolation, and she said to herself that it was merely the shyness that comes from love. However, her melancholy began to turn into irritation, and shortly before Boris's departure, she undertook a decisive plan.

As if you could come at a wrong time!’ said Boris, and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian, but a hussar officer, and an old friend of his. ‘Count Zhilinski—le Comte N. N.—le Capitaine S. S.’ said he, naming his guests. Rostov looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, bowed reluctantly, and remained silent."
"— Ловко написано, что и говорить, — сказал Тушин. Да не в том дело, Василий Дмитрич, — он тоже обратился к Ростову, — покориться надо, а вот Василий Дмитрич не хочет. Ведь аудитор говорил вам, что дело ваше плохо.","- Deftly written, what to say, - said Tushin. But that’s not the point, Vassily Dmitritch,” he also turned to Rostov, “it’s necessary to submit, but Vassily Dmitritch doesn’t want to. After all, the auditor told you that your case is bad.","“It's cleverly written, there's no saying it's not,” said Tushin. “But that's not the point, Vassily Dmitrich,” he also turned to Rostov, “a man ought to submit, but Vassily Dmitrich here doesn't want to.

"— Что? Кому?… Шутишь! — крикнул граф, вдруг апоплексически краснея шеей и затылком, как краснеют старые люди.","- What? To whom?... You're kidding! shouted the Count, suddenly blushing apoplectically on his neck and the back of his head, as old people blush.","“What? To whom? ... You're joking!” the count cried, his neck and nape suddenly turning an apoplectic red, as happens with old people.","‘What! To whom? … Nonsense!’ cried the count, suddenly reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do."
"— Нет, не надо. Мне так его жалко! Он такой милый.","- No, it's not necessary. I feel so sorry for him! He's so cute.","“No, I mustn't. I'm so sorry for him! He's so nice.”","‘No, I mustn’t. I am so sorry for him! He’s so nice.’"

"Старый граф иногда подходил к князю Андрею, целовал его, спрашивал у него совета на счет воспитания Пети или службы Николая. Старая графиня вздыхала, глядя на них. Соня боялась всякую минуту быть лишней и старалась находить предлоги оставлять их одних, когда им этого и не нужно было. Когда князь Андрей говорил (он очень хорошо рассказывал), Наташа с гордостью слушала его; когда она говорила, то со страхом и радостью замечала, что он внимательно и испытующе смотрит на нее. Она с недоумением спрашивала себя: «Что он ищет во мне? Чего-то он добивается своим взглядом! Что, как нет во мне того, что он ищет этим взглядом?» Иногда она входила в свойственное ей безумно-веселое расположение духа, и тогда она особенно любила слушать и смотреть, как князь Андрей смеялся. Он редко смеялся, но зато, когда он смеялся, то отдавался весь своему смеху, и всякий раз после этого смеха она чувствовала себя ближе к нему. Наташа была бы совершенно счастлива, ежели бы мысль о предстоящей и приближающейся разлуке не пугала ее, так как и он бледнел и холодел при одной мысли о том.","The old count sometimes approached Prince Andrei, kissed him, asked him for advice on the upbringing of Petya or the service of Nikolai. The old countess sighed as she looked at them. Sonya was afraid at any moment to be superfluous and tried to find excuses to leave them alone when they did not need it. When Prince Andrei spoke (he spoke very well), Natasha listened to him with pride; when she spoke, she noticed with fear and joy that he was looking at her attentively and searchingly. She asked herself in bewilderment: “What is he looking for in me? He's on to something with his eyes! What if there is not in me what he is looking for with this look? Sometimes she entered into her insanely cheerful mood, and then she especially liked to listen and watch how Prince Andrei laughed. He rarely laughed, but when he laughed, he gave himself over to his laughter, and every time after this laughter she felt closer to him. Natasha would have been perfectly happy if the thought of the impending and approaching parting had not frightened her, since he, too, turned pale and cold at the mere thought of it.","The old count sometimes went up to Prince Andrei, kissed him, and asked his advice about Petya's education or Nikolai's service. The old countess sighed, looking at them. Sonya feared every moment to be in the way and tried to find pretexts for leaving them alone, when they did not even want it. When Prince Andrei spoke (he was a very good storyteller), Natasha listened to him with pride; when she spoke, she noticed with fear and joy that he looked at her attentively and searchingly. She asked herself in perplexity: “What is he looking for in me? What is he seeking with his eyes? What if what he's looking for isn't in me?” Sometimes she got into her wildly merry state, and then she especially liked to hear and see how Prince Andrei laughed. He laughed rarely, but when he did, he gave himself wholly to his laughter, and each time after this laughter she felt closer to him. Natasha would have been perfectly happy, if the thought of the imminent and approaching separation had not frightened her.","Sometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrei, and ask his advice about Petya’s education or Nikolai’s service.

She asked herself in perplexity: ‘What does he look for in me? He is trying to discover something by looking at me! What if what he seeks in me is not there?’ Sometimes she fell into one of the mad, merry moods characteristic of her, and then she particularly loved to hear and see how Prince Andrei laughed. He seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his laughter, and after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him. Natasha would have been completely happy if the thought of the separation awaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her, just as the mere thought of it made him turn pale and cold."
"Дело было в том, что Илагин, с которым Ростовы были в ссоре и процессе, охотился в местах, по обычаю принадлежавших Ростовым, и теперь как будто нарочно велел подъехать к острову, где охотились Ростовы, и позволил травить своему охотнику из-под чужих гончих.","The fact was that Ilagin, with whom the Rostovs were in a quarrel and process, hunted in places that, according to custom, belonged to the Rostovs, and now, as if on purpose, he ordered to drive up to the island where the Rostovs hunted, and allowed his hunter to poison from under other hounds .","The thing was that Ilagin, with whom the Rostovs had had a quarrel and a lawsuit, used to hunt in places that customarily belonged to the Rostovs, and now as if on purpose had sent his men to the reserve where the Rostovs were hunting and had allowed his hunter to take the quarry hunted down by the Rostovs' hounds.","The facts were that Ilagin, with whom the Rostovs had a quarrel and were at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to the Rostovs, and had now, as if purposely, sent his men to the very woods the Rostovs were hunting, and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chased."
"— Знаю, верно про него думала, — сказал Николай улыбаясь, как узнала Наташа по звуку его голоса.","“I know, I was thinking about him right,” Nikolai said smiling, as Natasha recognized by the sound of his voice.","“I know, you must have been thinking about him,” said Nikolai, smiling, as Natasha could tell from the sound of his yoice.","‘I know, I expect you thought of him,’ said Nikolai, smiling as Natasha knew by the sound of his voice."

"Он продолжал свой дневник, и вот что он писал в нем за это время:","He continued his diary, and this is what he wrote in it during this time:","He continued his diary, and here is what he wrote in it during this time:","PIERRE went on with his diary, and this is what he wrote in it during that time:"
"Весь этот день охота была дома; было морозно и колко, но с вечера стало замолаживать и оттеплело. 15 сентября, когда молодой Ростов утром в халате выглянул в окно, он увидал такое утро, лучше которого ничего не могло быть для охоты: как будто небо таяло и без ветра спускалось на землю. Единственное движенье, которое было в воздухе, было тихое движенье сверху вниз спускающихся микроскопических капель мги или тумана. На оголившихся ветвях сада висели прозрачные капли и падали на только что свалившиеся листья. Земля на огороде, как мак, глянцевито-мокро чернела, и в недалеком расстоянии сливалась с тусклым и влажным покровом тумана. Николай вышел на мокрое с натасканной грязью крыльцо: пахло вянущим лесом и собаками. Чернопегая, широкозадая сука Милка с большими черными на выкате глазами, увидав хозяина, встала, потянулась назад и легла по-русачьи, потом неожиданно вскочила и лизнула его прямо в нос и усы. Другая борзая собака, увидав хозяина с цветной дорожки, выгибая спину, стремительно бросилась к крыльцу и подняв правило (хвост), стала тереться о ноги Николая.","All that day the hunt was at home; it was frosty and poignant, but in the evening it began to rejuvenate and warmed up. On September 15, when young Rostov looked out the window in the morning in a dressing gown, he saw such a morning, better than which nothing could be better for hunting: as if the sky was melting and descending to the ground without wind. The only movement that was in the air was the quiet movement from top to bottom of descending microscopic drops of mist or mist. Transparent drops hung from the bare branches of the garden and fell on the newly fallen leaves. The ground in the garden, like a poppy, turned black with a glossy wetness, and at a short distance merged with a dull and damp cover of fog. Nikolay went out onto the porch, wet with dirt, which smelled of withering forest and dogs. The black-spotted, broad-assed bitch Milka, with big black bulging eyes, saw her master, got up, stretched back and lay down like a blond, then unexpectedly jumped up and licked him right on the nose and mustache. Another greyhound dog, seeing the owner from the colored path, arching its back, quickly rushed to the porch and raising the rule (tail), began to rub against Nikolai's legs.","All that day the hunt stayed at home; it was frosty and biting, but in the evening it became overcast and turned warmer. On the fifteenth of September, when young Rostov, in his dressing gown, glanced out the window in the morning, he saw a morning than which nothing could be better for hunting: it was as if the sky was melting and, without wind, descending to earth. The only movement in the air was the slow movement from above to below of descending microscopic drops of mist or fog. Transparent drops hung on the bare branches of the garden and dripped onto the just-fallen leaves. The soil in the kitchen garden, glistening wet and black as poppy seed, merged in the near distance with the dull and damp curtain of the mist. Nikolai went out to the wet, mud-tracked porch; there was a smell of fading leaves and dogs. The black-spotted, broad-haunched bitch Milka, with big, black, bulging eyes, seeing her master, got up, stretched her hind legs, and lay down harelike, then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on the nose and mustache. Another borzoi, seeing his master from the garden path, rushed headlong, arching his back, towards the porch and, raising his stern (tail), began to rub himself against Nikolai's legs. “Hal-loo!”","It was frosty and the air was sharp, but towards evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw. On the 15th, when young Rostov in his dressing-gown looked out of the window, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting: it was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind. The only motion in the air was that of the dripping, microscopic particles of drizzling mist. The bare twigs in the garden were hung with transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves. The earth in the kitchen-garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy-seed and at a short distance merged into the dull moist veil of mist. Nikolai went out into the wet and muddy porch. There was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog. Milka, a black-spotted broad-haunched bitch with prominent black eyes, got up on seeing her master, stretched her hind legs, lay down like a hare and then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and moustache. Another borzoi, a dog, catching sight of his master from the garden path, arched his back and rushing headlong towards the porch with lifted tail began rubbing himself against his legs. ‘O-hoy!’ came at that moment"
"— Ну длинно, так заметаем, в одну минутую заметаем, — сказала решительная Дуняша, из платочка на груди вынимая иголку и опять на полу принимаясь за работу.","“Well, it’s a long time, so we’ll sweep it, we’ll sweep it in a minute,” said the resolute Dunyasha, taking out a needle from a handkerchief on her chest and again set to work on the floor.","“Well, if it's long, we can take it up, we can take it up in a minute,” said the resolute Dunyasha, taking a needle out of the fichu on her breast and setting to work again on the floor.","‘Well, if it’s too long we’ll tack it up … we’ll tack it up in one minute,’ said the resolute Dunyasha taking a needle that was stuck on the front of her little shawl and, still kneeling on the floor, set to work once more."
"— За вами 43 тысячи, граф, — сказал Долохов и потягиваясь встал из-за стола. — А устаешь однако так долго сидеть, — сказал он.","“You have 43 thousand behind you, count,” Dolokhov said and stood up from the table, stretching. “But you get tired of sitting for so long,” he said.","“You owe me forty-three thousand, Count,” said Dolokhov, and he stood up from the table and stretched. “It's tiring, though, to sit so long,” he said.","‘You owe forty-three thousand, Count,’ said Dolokhov, and stretching himself he rose from the table. ‘One does get tired sitting so long,’ he added."
"«Этот, кажется, была Наташа, подумал Николай, а эта m-me Schoss; а может быть и нет, а это черкес с усами не знаю кто, но я люблю ее».","“This one, it seems, was Natasha,” Nikolai thought, and this one is m-me Schoss; or maybe not, but this is a Circassian with a mustache, I don’t know who, but I love her.","“That one, I think, was Natasha,” thought Nikolai, “and that one Mme Schoss, or maybe not; and this Circassian with the mustache—I don't know who she is, but I love her.”","‘I think this used to be Natasha,’ thought Nikolai, ‘and that was Madame Schoss, but perhaps it’s not, and this Circassian with the moustache I don’t know, but I love her.’"
"Иногда он утешал себя мыслями, что это только так, покамест, он ведет эту жизнь; но потом его ужасала другая мысль, что так, покамест, уже сколько людей входили, как он, со всеми зубами и волосами в эту жизнь и в этот клуб и выходили оттуда без одного зуба и волоса.","Sometimes he comforted himself with the thought that this was the only way, while he was leading this life; but then he was horrified by another thought that for the time being, so many people had already entered this life and this club with all their teeth and hair, like him, and left without one tooth and hair.","He sometimes comforted himself with the thought that he happened to be leading this life just so, in the meantime; but then he would be horrified by another thought, that it was just so, in the meantime, that so many people had entered this life, this club, as he had, with all their teeth and hair, and come out of it with not a single tooth or hair left.","Sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought of how many, like himself, had entered that life and that club temporarily, with all their teeth and hair, and had only left it when not a single tooth or lock of hair remained."
"— Разве не всё равно, как написана нота, граф? — сказал он, — ежели содержание ее сильно.","“Isn’t it all the same how the note is written, Count?” he said, “if its content is strong.","“Does it make any difference how the note is worded, Count,” he said, “if the content is strong?”","‘Does it matter, Count, how the Note is worded,’ he asked, ‘so long as its substance is forceful?’"
"— Мама, ради Бога ничего не спрашивайте у меня теперь. Это нельзя говорить, — сказала Наташа.","- Mom, for God's sake don't ask me anything now. You can’t say that,” Natasha said.","“Mama, for God's sake, don't ask me anything now. It's impossible to talk about it,” said Natasha.","‘Mama! For heaven’s sake don’t ask me anything now! One can’t talk about that,’ said Natasha."
"— Не называйте его дурным, — сказала Наташа. — Но я ничего — ничего не знаю… — Она опять заплакала.","""Don't call him bad,"" said Natasha. “But I don’t know anything…” She began to cry again.","“Don't call him bad,” said Natasha. “But I don't know, I don't know anything ...” She began to cry again.","‘Don’t call him bad!’ said Natasha. ‘But I don’t know, don’t know at all …’"
"— Ты уж попался раз на petite fille [девочке], — сказал Долохов, знавший про женитьбу Анатоля. — Смотри!","- You already got caught once on a petite fille [girl], - said Dolokhov, who knew about Anatole's marriage. - Look!","she'll get all flustered.” “You already got caught once over a petite fille,” said Dolokhov, who knew about Anatole's marriage. “Watch out.”","‘You have been caught once already by a “little girl”,’ said Dolokhov, who knew of Kuragin’s marriage. ‘Take care!’"
"3-го марта во всех комнатах Английского клуба стоял стон разговаривающих голосов и, как пчелы на весеннем пролете, сновали взад и вперед, сидели, стояли, сходились и расходились, в мундирах, фраках и еще кое-кто в пудре и кафтанах, члены и гости клуба. Пудренные, в чулках и башмаках ливрейные лакеи стояли у каждой двери и напряженно старались уловить каждое движение гостей и членов клуба, чтобы предложить свои услуги. Большинство присутствовавших были старые, почтенные люди с широкими, самоуверенными лицами, толстыми пальцами, твердыми движениями и голосами. Этого рода гости и члены сидели по известным, привычным местам и сходились в известных, привычных кружках. Малая часть присутствовавших состояла из случайных гостей — преимущественно молодежи, в числе которой были Денисов, Ростов и Долохов, который был опять семеновским офицером. На лицах молодежи, особенно военной, было выражение того чувства презрительной почтительности к старикам, которое как будто говорит старому поколению: уважать и почитать вас мы готовы, но помните, что всё-таки за нами будущность.","On March 3, in all the rooms of the English Club there was a groan of talking voices and, like bees on a spring flight, scurried back and forth, sat, stood, converged and dispersed, in uniforms, tailcoats, and some others in powder and caftans, members and club guests. Powder-coated, stockinged and clogged footmen in livery stood at every door and tried hard to catch every movement of the guests and members of the club in order to offer their services. Most of those present were old, respectable people with broad, self-confident faces, thick fingers, firm movements and voices. This kind of guests and members sat in well-known, familiar places and met in well-known, familiar circles. A small part of those present consisted of random guests - mostly young people, among whom were Denisov, Rostov and Dolokhov, who was again a Semenov officer. On the faces of young people, especially military ones, there was an expression of that feeling of contemptuous respect for the elderly, which seems to say to the old generation: we are ready to respect and honor you, but remember that the future is still behind us.","On the third of March, the drone of talking voices hung in all the rooms of the English Club and, like bees in spring, the members and guests of the club shuttled back and forth, sat, stood, came together and dispersed again, in uniforms, tailcoats, and some even in powdered wigs and kaftans.[88 ] Powdered, liveried servants in stockings and buckled shoes stood by every door and strained to catch every movement of the guests and members of the club, in order to offer their services. The majority of those present were venerable old people with broad, self-confident faces, fat fingers, firm movements and voices. This sort of guests and members sat in their known, habitual places, and met together in known, habitual circles. A small part of those present consisted of chance guests—mostly young men, among whom were Denisov, Rostov, and Dolokhov, who had again become an officer of the Semyonovsky regiment. On the faces of the young men, especially the military, there was an expression of that feeling of disdainful deference towards the old men which seemed to say to the older generation: “ We're prepared to respect and honor you, but remember all the same that the future is ours.”","ON that 3rd of March all the rooms in the English Club were filled with a hum of conversation, like the hum of bees swarming in spring-time. The members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither, sat, stood, met, and separated, some in uniform and some in evening dress and a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaftans. Powdered footmen in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings stood at every door anxiously noting visitors’ every movement in order to offer their services. Most of those present were elderly respected men with broad self-confident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures and voices. This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual groups. A minority of those present were casual guests—chiefly young men, among whom were Denisov, Rostov and Dolokhov—who was now again an officer in the Semyonov regiment. The faces of these young people, especially those who were military men, bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older generation, ‘We are prepared to respect and honour you, but all the same remember that the future belongs to us.’"

"— Я вперед сказала, — говорила Анна Павловна о Пьере, — я тогда же сейчас сказала, и прежде всех (она настаивала на своем первенстве), что это безумный молодой человек, испорченный развратными идеями века. Я тогда еще сказала это, когда все восхищались им и он только приехал из-за границы, и помните, у меня как-то вечером представлял из себя какого-то Марата. Чем же кончилось?

Потом, будто, вышли мы все из комнаты, и что-то тут случилось мудреное. Мы сидели или лежали на полу. Он мне что-то говорил. А мне будто захотелось показать ему свою чувствительность и я, не вслушиваясь в его речи, стал себе воображать состояние своего внутреннего человека и осенившую меня милость Божию. И появились у меня слезы на глазах, и я был доволен, что он это приметил. Но он взглянул на меня с досадой и вскочил, пресекши свой разговор. Я обробел и спросил, не ко мне ли сказанное относилось; но он ничего не отвечал, показал мне ласковый вид, и после вдруг очутились мы в спальне моей, где стоит двойная кровать. Он лег на нее на край, и я будто пылал к нему желанием ласкаться и прилечь тут же. И он будто у меня спрашивает: „Скажите по правде, какое вы имеете главное пристрастие? Узнали ли вы его? Я думаю, что вы уже его узнали“. Я, смутившись сим вопросом, отвечал, что лень мое главное пристрастие. Он недоверчиво покачал головой.

I became embittered and asked if what had been said referred to me; but he did not answer, showed me a kind look, and after that we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom, where there is a double bed. He lay down on her on the edge, and I seemed to be burning with a desire to caress him and lie down right there. And he seemed to ask me: “Tell me, what is your main passion? Did you recognize him? I think you already know him."" I, embarrassed by this question, answered that laziness was my main addiction. He shook his head in disbelief. And I answered him, even more embarrassed, that although I live with my wife, on his advice, but not as the husband of my wife. To this he objected that he should not deprive his wife of his affection, he made me feel that this was my duty. But I answered that I was ashamed of it, and suddenly everything disappeared. And I woke up and found in my thoughts the text of the Holy Scriptures: The belly was the light of a man, and the light shines in the darkness and the darkness does not embrace it. Iosif Alekseevich's face was youthful and bright. On this day I received a letter from a benefactor in which he writes about the obligations of marriage.","Dreamed that Iosif Alexeich was sitting in my house, and I was very glad and wanted to make him welcome. That I was babbling incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that he would not like it, and I wanted to get close to him and embrace him. But as soon as I got close to him, I saw that his face was transfigured, had become young, and he was telling me something very, very softly about the teaching of the order, so softly that I couldn't hear it. That we all left the room, and then something complicated happened. We were sitting or lying on the floor. He was saying something to me. And I wanted to show him my sensitivity, and, without listening to what he said, I began to imagine to myself the state of my inner man and the grace of God coming upon me. And tears came to my eyes, and I was pleased that he noticed it. But he looked at me with vexation and jumped up, breaking off his conversation. I grew timid and asked whether what he was saying referred to me; but he did not reply, looked at me gently, and after that we were suddenly in my bedroom, where there was a double bed. He lay on the edge of it, and I, as if burning with the desire to caress him, lay beside him. And he asked me: “Tell me truly, what is your main predilection? Do you know it? I think you've already found it out.” Embarrassed by this question, I replied that laziness was my main predilection. He shook his head mistrustfully. And, still more embarrassed, I replied that, though I was living with my wife on his advice, I was not a husband to my wife. To this he objected that my wife should not be deprived of my caresses, and gave me to understand that this was my duty. But I replied that I was ashamed of it; and suddenly everything disappeared. And I woke up and found in my thoughts the text of Holy Scripture: “And the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not. ”[139] Iosif Alexeevich's face had been youthful and bright. That day I received a letter from my benefactor about the duty of married life, 9 December.","I dreamt that Iosif Alexeevich was sitting in my house, and that I was very glad, and wished to entertain him. It seemed as if I chattered incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could not please him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace him. But as soon as I drew near, I saw that his face had changed and grown young, and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our Order, but so softly that I could not hear it. Then it seemed that we all left the room and something strange happened. We were sitting or lying on the floor. He was telling me something, and I wished to show him my sensibility, and not listening to what he was saying, I began picturing to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of God sanctifying me. And tears came into my eyes, and I was glad he noticed this. But he looked at me with vexation and jumped up, breaking off his remarks. I felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern me; but he did not reply, gave me a kind look, and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed. He lay down on the edge of it and I burned with longing to caress him and lie down too. And he said, ‘Tell me frankly what is your chief temptation? Do you know it? I think you know it already.’ Abashed by this question, I replied that sloth was my chief temptation. He shook his head incredulously; and even more abashed, I said that though I was living with my wife as he advised, I was not living with her as her husband. To this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of one’s embraces, and gave me to understand that that was my duty. But I replied that I should be ashamed to do it, and suddenly everything vanished. And I awoke and found in my mind the text from the Gospel: ‘The life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.’ Iosif Alexeevich’s face had looked young and bright. That day I received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about ‘conjugal duties’."

"— Ничего… так мне грустно стало… грустно об Андрее, — сказала она, отирая слезы о колени невестки. Несколько раз, в продолжение утра, княжна Марья начинала приготавливать невестку, и всякий раз начинала плакать. Слезы эти, которых причину не понимала маленькая княгиня, встревожили ее, как ни мало она была наблюдательна. Она ничего не говорила, но беспокойно оглядывалась, отыскивая чего-то. Перед обедом в ее комнату вошел старый князь, которого она всегда боялась, теперь с особенно-неспокойным, злым лицом и, ни слова не сказав, вышел. Она посмотрела на княжну Марью, потом задумалась с тем выражением глаз устремленного внутрь себя внимания, которое бывает у беременных женщин, и вдруг заплакала.","“Nothing ...

"Несмотря на огромное богатство графа Безухого, с тех пор, как Пьер получил его и получал, как говорили, 500 тысяч годового дохода, он чувствовал себя гораздо менее богатым, чем когда он получал свои 10-ть тысяч от покойного графа. В общих чертах он смутно чувствовал следующий бюджет. В Совет платилось около 80-ти тысяч по всем имениям; около 30-ти тысяч стоило содержание подмосковной, московского дома и княжон; около 15-ти тысяч выходило на пенсии, столько же на богоугодные заведения; графине на прожитье посылалось 150 тысяч; процентов платилось за долги около 70-ти тысяч; постройка начатой церкви стоила эти два года около 10-ти тысяч; остальное около 100-та тысяч расходилось — он сам не знал как, и почти каждый год он принужден был занимать. Кроме того каждый год главноуправляющий писал то о пожарах, то о неурожаях, то о необходимости перестроек фабрик и заводов. И так, первое дело, представившееся Пьеру, было то, к которому он менее всего имел способности и склонности — занятие делами.","Despite the great wealth of Count Earless, since Pierre received it and received, as they say, 500,000 annual income, he felt much less wealthy than when he received his 10,000 from the late count. In general terms, he had a vague idea of the next budget. About 80 thousand were paid to the Council for all estates; about 30 thousand was the cost of maintaining a suburban, Moscow house and princesses; about 15 thousand retired, the same number went to charitable institutions; 150 thousand were sent to the countess for living; about 70 thousand percent was paid for debts; the construction of the begun church cost these two years about 10 thousand; the rest, about 100,000, diverged - he himself did not know how, and almost every year he was forced to borrow. In addition, every year the chief executive wrote about fires, then about crop failures, then about the need to rebuild factories and plants. And so, the first thing that presented itself to Pierre was the one for which he had the least ability and inclination - doing business.","Despite Count Bezukhov's enormous wealth, ever since Pierre had received it—and he received, so it was said, a yearly income of five hundred thousand— he had felt himself much less rich than when he had received his ten thousand from the late count. In general terms he was vaguely aware of the following budget. Around eighty thousand was paid to the Council for all the estates; around thirty thousand went to the upkeep of the suburban Moscow estate, the Moscow house, and the princesses; around fifteen thousand was distributed in pensions and the same amount to charitable institutions; a hundred and fifty thousand was sent to the countess for her expenses; around seventy thousand was paid as interest on debts; the building of a new church, already begun, had been costing around ten thousand over the past two years; the rest, around a hundred thousand, got spent, he did not know how himself, and he was obliged to borrow almost every year. Besides that, every year the head steward wrote now about fires, now about poor harvests, now about the necessity of rebuilding mills and factories. And so, the first thing facing Pierre was that for which he had least ability or inclination—business matters.","Despite Count Bezukhov’s enormous wealth, since he had come into an income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year, Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an allowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the following budget: About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank; about 30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town house, and the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was given in pensions and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was sent to the countess; about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The building of a new church previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in each of the last two years, and he did not know how the rest, about 100,000 rubles, was spent, and almost every year he was obliged to borrow. Besides this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests, or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops. So the first task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or inclination—practical business."

"В Москве, как только он въехал в свой огромный дом с засохшими и засыхающими княжнами, с громадной дворней, как только он увидал — проехав по городу — эту Иверскую часовню с бесчисленными огнями свеч перед золотыми ризами, эту Кремлевскую площадь с незаезженным снегом, этих извозчиков и лачужки Сивцева Вражка, увидал стариков московских, ничего не желающих и никуда не спеша доживающих свой век, увидал старушек, московских барынь, московские балы и Московский Английский клуб, — он почувствовал себя дома, в тихом пристанище. Ему стало в Москве покойно, тепло, привычно и грязно, как в старом халате.","In Moscow, as soon as he drove into his huge house with withered and withering princesses, with huge domestics, as soon as he saw - driving through the city - this Iberian chapel with countless candle lights in front of golden robes, this Kremlin Square with snow that had not been driven, these cab drivers and the shacks of Sivtsev Vrazhka, saw the old men of Moscow, wanting nothing and slowly living out their lives anywhere, saw old women, Moscow ladies, Moscow balls and the Moscow English Club - he felt at home, in a quiet haven. He felt calm, warm, familiar and dirty in Moscow, as in an old dressing gown.","In Moscow, as soon as he moved into his huge house with the dried- and drying-up princesses, with its enormous staff, as soon as he saw—on driving through the city—the Iverskaya Chapel[163] with countless candles burning before the gold casing, saw the Kremlin Square with its untrampled snow, the cabbies, the hovels of the Sivtsev Vrazhek, saw old Moscow men, who desired nothing and were not hurrying anywhere as they lived out their lives, saw little old women, Moscow ladies, Moscow balls, and the Moscow English Club—he felt himself at home, in a quiet haven. For him Moscow was comfortable, warm, habitual, and dirty, like an old dressing gown.","In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue: as soon as, driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable tapers burning before the golden settings of the icons, the Kremlin Square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sledge-drivers and hovels of the Sivtsev Vrazhok, those old Moscovites who desired nothing, hurried nowhere, and were ending their days leisurely; when he saw those old Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls and the English Club, he felt himself at home in a quiet haven. In Moscow he felt at peace, at home, warm and dirty as in an old dressing-gown."
"— Да, и пить, — подхватил Николай. — Эй ты! Еще бутылку! — крикнул он.","“Yes, and drink,” Nikolai picked up. - Hey, you!

"— Eh, bien, general, tout est a la guerre, a ce qu'il parait, [Ну что ж, генерал, дело, кажется, идет к войне, ] — сказал он, как будто сожалея об обстоятельстве, о котором он не мог судить.","- Eh, bien, general, tout est a la guerre, a ce qu'il parait, [Well, general, things seem to be going to war,] - he said, as if regretting a circumstance that he did not could judge.","“Eh bien, général, tout est à la guerre, à ce qu'il parait,”[401] he said as if regretting the circumstance, of which he could not judge.","‘Eh bien, général, tout est à la guerre, à ce qu’il paraît,’2 as if regretting a circumstance of which he was unable to judge."
"Потом он вспомнил грубость, ясность ее мыслей и вульгарность выражений, свойственных ей, несмотря на ее воспитание в высшем аристократическом кругу. «Я не какая-нибудь дура… поди сам попробуй… allez vous promener», [убирайся, ] говорила она. Часто, глядя на ее успех в глазах старых и молодых мужчин и женщин, Пьер не мог понять, отчего он не любил ее. Да я никогда не любил ее, говорил себе Пьер; я знал, что она развратная женщина, повторял он сам себе, но не смел признаться в этом.","Then he remembered the coarseness, the clarity of her thoughts, and the vulgarity of her expressions, despite her upbringing in the highest aristocratic circle. “I'm not some kind of fool… go try it yourself… allez vous promener,” [get out,] she said. Often, looking at her success in the eyes of old and young men and women, Pierre could not understand why he did not love her. Yes, I never loved her, Pierre said to himself; I knew she was a depraved woman, he repeated to himself, but he did not dare to admit it.","Then he recalled the clarity and coarseness of thought and the vulgarity of expression typical of her, despite her upbringing in high aristocratic circles. “I'm not such a fool... go and give it a try... allez vous promener”[281] she used to say. Often, looking at her success in the eyes of old and young men and women, Pierre could not understand why he did not love her. “And I never loved her,” Pierre said to himself. “I knew she was a depraved woman,” he repeated, “but I didn't dare admit it to myself.”","Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles. ‘I’m not such a fool … Just you try it on … Allez-vous promener,’1 she used to say. Often seeing the success she had with young and old men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not love her. ‘Yes, I never loved her,’ said he to himself; ‘I knew she was a depraved woman,’ he repeated, ‘but dared not admit it to myself."
"Оставшись один, Пьер продолжал всё так же улыбаться. Раза два он пожимал плечами, подносил руку к платку, как бы желая снять его, и опять опускал ее. Пять минут, которые он пробыл с связанными глазами, показались ему часом. Руки его отекли, ноги подкашивались; ему казалось, что он устал. Он испытывал самые сложные и разнообразные чувства. Ему было и страшно того, что с ним случится, и еще более страшно того, как бы ему не выказать страха. Ему было любопытно узнать, что будет с ним, что откроется ему; но более всего ему было радостно, что наступила минута, когда он наконец вступит на тот путь обновления и деятельно-добродетельной жизни, о котором он мечтал со времени своей встречи с Осипом Алексеевичем. В дверь послышались сильные удары. Пьер снял повязку и оглянулся вокруг себя. В комнате было черно — темно: только в одном месте горела лампада, в чем-то белом. Пьер подошел ближе и увидал, что лампада стояла на черном столе, на котором лежала одна раскрытая книга. Книга была Евангелие; то белое, в чем горела лампада, был человечий череп с своими дырами и зубами. Прочтя первые слова Евангелия: «Вначале бе слово и слово бе к Богу», Пьер обошел стол и увидал большой, наполненный чем-то и открытый ящик. Это был гроб с костями. Его нисколько не удивило то, что он увидал. Надеясь вступить в совершенно новую жизнь, совершенно отличную от прежней, он ожидал всего необыкновенного, еще более необыкновенного чем то, что он видел. Череп, гроб, Евангелие — ему казалось, что он ожидал всего этого, ожидал еще большего. Стараясь вызвать в себе чувство умиленья, он смотрел вокруг себя. — «Бог, смерть, любовь, братство людей», — говорил он себе, связывая с этими словами смутные, но радостные представления чего-то. Дверь отворилась, и кто-то вошел.","Left alone, Pierre continued to smile the same way. Once or twice he shrugged his shoulders, put his hand up to the handkerchief, as if wishing to take it off, and lowered it again. The five minutes he spent with his eyes tied seemed like an hour to him. His hands were swollen, his legs gave way; he seemed to be tired. He experienced the most complex and varied feelings. He was both afraid of what would happen to him, and even more afraid of how he would not show fear. He was curious to know what would become of him, what would be revealed to him; but most of all he was glad that the moment had come when he would finally embark on that path of renewal and an active and virtuous life, which he had dreamed of since his meeting with Osip Alekseevich. Strong knocks were heard at the door. Pierre took off his bandage and looked around him. The room was black and dark: only in one place was a lamp burning, in something white. Pierre came closer and saw that the lamp stood on a black table, on which lay one open book. The book was the gospel; that white, in which the lamp burned, was a human skull with its holes and teeth. After reading the first words of the Gospel: “In the beginning there was no word, and the word went to God,” Pierre went around the table and saw a large open box filled with something. It was a coffin with bones. He was not at all surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter into a completely new life, completely different from the old one, he expected everything extraordinary, even more extraordinary than what he saw. The skull, the coffin, the Gospel - it seemed to him that he expected all this, expected even more. Trying to arouse in himself a feeling of tenderness, he looked around him. “God, death, love, the brotherhood of man,” he said to himself, associating with these words vague but joyful ideas of something. The door opened and someone entered.","Left alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way.

"Вскоре после святок Николай объявил матери о своей любви к Соне и о твердом решении жениться на ней. Графиня, давно замечавшая то, что происходило между Соней и Николаем, и ожидавшая этого объяснения, молча выслушала его слова и сказала сыну, что он может жениться на ком хочет; но что ни она, ни отец не дадут ему благословения на такой брак. В первый раз Николай почувствовал, что мать недовольна им, что несмотря на всю свою любовь к нему, она не уступит ему. Она, холодно и не глядя на сына, послала за мужем; и, когда он пришел, графиня хотела коротко и холодно в присутствии Николая сообщить ему в чем дело, но не выдержала: заплакала слезами досады и вышла из комнаты. Старый граф стал нерешительно усовещивать Николая и просить его отказаться от своего намерения. Николай отвечал, что он не может изменить своему слову, и отец, вздохнув и очевидно смущенный, весьма скоро перервал свою речь и пошел к графине. При всех столкновениях с сыном, графа не оставляло сознание своей виноватости перед ним за расстройство дел, и потому он не мог сердиться на сына за отказ жениться на богатой невесте и за выбор бесприданной Сони, — он только при этом случае живее вспоминал то, что, ежели бы дела не были расстроены, нельзя было для Николая желать лучшей жены, чем Соня; и что виновен в расстройстве дел только один он с своим Митенькой и с своими непреодолимыми привычками.","Soon after Christmas, Nikolai announced to his mother his love for Sonya and his firm decision to marry her. The countess, who had long noticed what was happening between Sonya and Nikolai, and was expecting this explanation, silently listened to his words and told her son that he could marry whomever he wanted; but that neither she nor his father would give him blessings for such a marriage. For the first time, Nikolai felt that his mother was unhappy with him, that despite all her love for him, she would not give in to him. She, coldly and not looking at her son, sent for her husband; and when he arrived, the countess wanted to briefly and coldly tell him what was the matter in the presence of Nikolai, but she could not stand it: she burst into tears of annoyance and left the room. The old count began to hesitantly admonish Nicholas and ask him to abandon his intention. Nikolai replied that he could not change his word, and his father, sighing and obviously embarrassed, very soon interrupted his speech and went to the countess. In all clashes with his son, the count did not leave the consciousness of his guilt before him for the disorder of affairs, and therefore he could not be angry with his son for refusing to marry a rich bride and for choosing Sonya without a dowry - he only on this occasion more vividly recalled that, if things had not been upset, it would have been impossible for Nicholas to wish for a better wife than Sonya; and that only he, with his Mitenka and his irresistible habits, is to blame for the disorder of affairs.","Soon after Christmastime, Nikolai told his mother about his love for Sonya and his firm decision to marry her. The countess, who had long noticed what was happening between Sonya and Nikolai, and had been expecting this talk, listened silently to his words and said to her son that he could marry whomever he wanted, but that neither she nor his father would give their blessing to such a marriage. For the first time, Nikolai felt that his mother was displeased with him, and that, despite all her love for him, she would not yield. Coldly and without looking at her son, she sent for her husband; and when he came, the countess was going to tell him, briefly and coldly, in Nikolai's presence, what the matter was, but she could not stand it : she wept tears of vexation and left the room. The old count began hesitantly to admonish Nikolai and beg him to renounce his intention. Nikolai replied that he could not go back on his word, and his father sighed and, obviously embarrassed, very quickly broke off their talk and went to the countess. In all his confrontations with his son, the count had always been aware of his guilt before him for the disorder of his affairs, and therefore he could not be angry with his son for his refusal to marry a rich bride and his choice of the dowerless Sonya—he only remembered more vividly that, if their affairs had not been in disorder, they could not have hoped for a better wife for Nikolai than Sonya; and that he alone, with his Mitenka and his insuperable habits, was to blame for the disorder of their affairs.","SOON after the Christmas holidays Nikolai told his mother of his love for Sonya and of his firm resolve to marry her. The countess who had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this declaration, listened to him in silence, and then told her son that he might marry whom he pleased, but that neither she nor his father would give their blessing to such a marriage. Nikolai, for the first time, felt that his mother was displeased with him and that, despite her love for him, she would not give way. Coldly, without looking at her son, she sent for her husband, and when he came tried briefly and coldly to inform him of the facts, in her son’s presence, but unable to restrain herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room. The old count began irresolutely to admonish Nikolai and beg him to abandon his purpose. Nikolai replied that he could not go back on his word, and his father, sighing and evidently disconcerted, very soon became silent and went in to the countess. In all his encounters with his son the count was always conscious of his own guilt towards him for having wasted the family fortune, and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry an heiress and choosing the dower-less Sonya. On this occasion he was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not been in disorder, no better wife for Nikolai than Sonya could have been wished for, and that no one but himself, with his Mitenka and his unconquerable habits, was to blame for the condition of the family finances."

"Берг уже более месяца был женихом и только неделя оставалась до свадьбы, а граф еще не решил с собой вопроса о приданом и не говорил об этом с женою. Граф то хотел отделить Вере рязанское именье, то хотел продать лес, то занять денег под вексель. За несколько дней до свадьбы Берг вошел рано утром в кабинет к графу и с приятной улыбкой почтительно попросил будущего тестя объявить ему, что будет дано за графиней Верой. Граф так смутился при этом давно предчувствуемом вопросе, что сказал необдуманно первое, что пришло ему в голову.","Berg had been the groom for more than a month and only a week remained before the wedding, and the count had not yet decided with himself the question of dowry and did not talk about it with his wife.

A few days before the wedding, Berg entered the count's office early in the morning and, with a pleasant smile, respectfully asked the future father-in-law to tell him what would be given for Countess Vera.

Several days before the wedding, Berg came into the count's study early in the morning and, with a pleasant smile, respectfully asked his future father-in-law to tell him what Countess Vera's dowry would be.

"Вера, решив в своем уме, что Пьера надо занимать разговором о французском посольстве, тотчас же начала этот разговор.

"Дом Карагиных был в эту зиму в Москве самым приятным и гостеприимным домом. Кроме званых вечеров и обедов, каждый день у Карагиных собиралось большое общество, в особенности мужчин, ужинающих в 12-м часу ночи и засиживающихся до 3-го часу. Не было бала, гулянья, театра, который бы пропускала Жюли. Туалеты ее были всегда самые модные. Но, несмотря на это, Жюли казалась разочарована во всем, говорила всякому, что она не верит ни в дружбу, ни в любовь, ни в какие радости жизни, и ожидает успокоения только там. Она усвоила себе тон девушки, понесшей великое разочарованье, девушки, как будто потерявшей любимого человека или жестоко обманутой им. Хотя ничего подобного с ней не случилось, на нее смотрели, как на такую, и сама она даже верила, что она много пострадала в жизни. Эта меланхолия, не мешавшая ей веселиться, не мешала бывавшим у нее молодым людям приятно проводить время. Каждый гость, приезжая к ним, отдавал свой долг меланхолическому настроению хозяйки и потом занимался и светскими разговорами, и танцами, и умственными играми, и турнирами буриме, которые были в моде у Карагиных. Только некоторые молодые люди, в числе которых был и Борис, более углублялись в меланхолическое настроение Жюли, и с этими молодыми людьми она имела более продолжительные и уединенные разговоры о тщете всего мирского, и им открывала свои альбомы, исписанные грустными изображениями, изречениями и стихами.","The Karagins' house was the most pleasant and hospitable house in Moscow that winter.

There was no ball, festivities, theater that Julie would miss. Her toilets were always the most fashionable. But, despite this, Julie seemed disappointed in everything, told everyone that she did not believe in friendship, or in love, or in any joys of life, and expected peace only there. She adopted the tone of a girl who has suffered great disappointment, a girl who seems to have lost a loved one or was cruelly deceived by him. Although nothing like this happened to her, they looked at her as such, and she herself even believed that she had suffered a lot in life. This melancholy, which did not prevent her from having fun, did not prevent the young people who visited her from having a good time. Each guest, coming to them, gave his debt to the melancholic mood of the hostess and then engaged in secular conversations, and dances, and mental games, and burime tournaments, which were in vogue with the Karagins. Only some young people, including Boris, went deeper into Julie's melancholy mood, and with these young people she had longer and more solitary conversations about the vanity of everything worldly, and to them she opened her albums, covered with sad images, sayings and poems.","That winter the Karagins' house was the most agreeable and hospitable house in Moscow.

But in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything, and told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love, or any of the joys of life, and expected peace only ‘yonder’. She adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment, like a girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him. Though nothing of the kind had happened to her, she was regarded in that light and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered much in life. This melancholy, which did not prevent her amusing herself, did not hinder the young people who came to her house from passing the time pleasantly. Every visitor who came to the house paid his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess, and then amused himself with society gossip, dancing, intellectual games, and bouts-rimés,* which were in vogue at the Karagins’. Only a few of these young men, among them Boris, entered more deeply into Julie’s melancholy, and with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of all worldly things, and to them she showed her albums, filled with mournful sketches, maxims, and verses."

Она решилась не говорить ей и уговорила отца скрыть получение страшного известия от невестки до ее разрешения, которое должно было быть на днях. Княжна Марья и старый князь, каждый по-своему, носили и скрывали свое горе. Старый князь не хотел надеяться: он решил, что князь Андрей убит, и не смотря на то, что он послал чиновника в Австрию розыскивать след сына, он заказал ему в Москве памятник, который намерен был поставить в своем саду, и всем говорил, что сын его убит. Он старался не изменяя вести прежний образ жизни, но силы изменяли ему: он меньше ходил, меньше ел, меньше спал, и с каждым днем делался слабее. Княжна Марья надеялась. Она молилась за брата, как за живого и каждую минуту ждала известия о его возвращении.","“Nothing,” said Princess Marya, looking firmly at her daughter-in-law with radiant eyes.

Сказав несколько слов с Пьером об ужасной дороге от границ Польши, о том, как он встретил в Швейцарии людей, знавших Пьера, и о господине Десале, которого он воспитателем для сына привез из-за границы, князь Андрей опять с горячностью вмешался в разговор о Сперанском, продолжавшийся между двумя стариками.","- Well, how are you?

"Это пултуская битва, которая считается великой победой, но которая совсем не такова, по моему мнению. Мы штатские имеем, как вы знаете, очень дурную привычку решать вопрос о выигрыше или проигрыше сражения. Тот, кто отступил после сражения, тот проиграл его, вот что мы говорим, и судя по этому мы проиграли пултуское сражение. Одним словом, мы отступаем после битвы, но посылаем курьера в Петербург с известием о победе, и генерал Бенигсен не уступает начальствования над армией генералу Буксгевдену, надеясь получить из Петербурга в благодарность за свою победу звание главнокомандующего. Во время этого междуцарствия, мы начинаем очень оригинальный и интересный ряд маневров. План наш не состоит более, как бы он должен был состоять, в том, чтобы избегать или атаковать неприятеля, но только в том, чтобы избегать генерала Буксгевдена, который по праву старшинства должен бы был быть нашим начальником. Мы преследуем эту цель с такой энергией, что даже переходя реку, на которой нет бродов, мы сжигаем мост, с целью отдалить от себя нашего врага, который в настоящее время не Бонапарт, но Буксгевден. Генерал Буксгевден чуть-чуть не был атакован и взят превосходными неприятельскими силами, вследствие одного из таких маневров, спасавших нас от него. Буксгевден нас преследует — мы бежим. Только что он перейдет на нашу сторону реки, мы переходим на другую. Наконец враг наш Буксгевден ловит нас и атакует. Оба генерала сердятся и дело доходит до вызова на дуэль со стороны Буксгевдена и припадка падучей болезни со стороны Бенигсена. Но в самую критическую минуту курьер, который возил в Петербург известие о пултуской победе, возвращается и привозит нам назначение главнокомандующего, и первый враг — Буксгевден побежден. Мы теперь можем думать о втором враге — Бонапарте. Но оказывается, что в эту самую минуту возникает перед нами третий враг — православное, которое громкими возгласами требует хлеба, говядины, сухарей, сена, овса, — и мало ли чего еще! Магазины пусты, дороги непроходимы. Православное начинает грабить, и грабёж доходит до такой степени, о которой последняя кампания не могла вам дать ни малейшего понятия. Половина полков образуют вольные команды, которые обходят страну и все предают мечу и пламени. Жители разорены совершенно, больницы завалены больными, и везде голод. Два раза мародеры нападали даже на главную квартиру, и главнокомандующий принужден был взять баталион солдат, чтобы прогнать их. В одно из этих нападений у меня унесли мой пустой чемодан и халат. Государь хочет дать право всем начальникам дивизии расстреливать мародеров, но я очень боюсь, чтобы это не заставило одну половину войска расстрелять другую. ]","This is the battle of Pultus, which is considered a great victory, but which is not at all such, in my opinion. We civilians have, as you know, a very bad habit of deciding whether to win or lose a battle. Whoever retreated after the battle lost it, that's what we say, and judging by this, we lost the battle of Pultus. In a word, we retreat after the battle, but we send a courier to Petersburg with the news of the victory, and General Bennigsen does not yield command of the army to General Buxgevden, hoping to receive the title of commander-in-chief from Petersburg in gratitude for his victory. During this interregnum, we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our plan is no longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but only to avoid General Buxhoeveden, who, by right of seniority, should have been our commander. We pursue this goal with such energy that even when we cross a river that has no fords, we burn the bridge in order to alienate our enemy, who at present is not Bonaparte, but Buxhoeveden. General Buxhoeveden was almost attacked and taken by a superior enemy force, in consequence of one of these maneuvers which saved us from him. Buxhoeveden pursues us - we run. As soon as he crosses to our side of the river, we cross to the other. Finally, our enemy Buxhoeveden catches us and attacks. Both generals become angry and it comes to a challenge to a duel from Buxhowden and a fit of epilepsy from Bennigsen. But at the most critical moment, the courier who carried the news of the Pultus victory to St. Petersburg returns and brings us the appointment of the commander in chief, and the first enemy, Bukshoevden, is defeated. We can now think of the second enemy, Bonaparte. But it turns out that at that very moment a third enemy appears before us - the Orthodox, who with loud exclamations demands bread, beef, crackers, hay, oats - and you never know what else! The shops are empty, the roads are impassable. The Orthodox begin to plunder, and the plunder reaches such a degree that the last campaign could not give you the slightest idea. Half of the regiments form free teams that go around the country and put everything to the sword and flame. The inhabitants are completely ruined, the hospitals are overwhelmed with sick people, and there is hunger everywhere. Twice marauders attacked even the main apartment, and the commander-in-chief was forced to take a battalion of soldiers to drive them away. During one of these attacks, my empty suitcase and bathrobe were taken from me. The sovereign wants to give the right to all division chiefs to shoot marauders, but I am very afraid that this will not force one half of the army to shoot the other. ]","Prince Andrei began by reading with his eyes alone, but then involuntarily (though he knew how far Bilibin was to be trusted) became more and interested in what he was reading.","At first Prince Andrei read with his eyes only, but after a while in spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust Bilibin) what he read began to interest him more and more."

"На каждую из фраз Наполеона Балашев хотел и имел что возразить; беспрестанно он делал движение человека, желавшего сказать что-то, но Наполеон перебивал его. Например, о безумии шведов Балашев хотел сказать, что Швеция есть остров, когда Россия за нее; но Наполеон сердито вскрикнул, чтобы заглушить его голос. Наполеон находился в том состоянии раздражения, в котором нужно говорить, говорить и говорить, только для того, чтобы самому себе доказать свою справедливость. Балашеву становилось тяжело: он, как посол, боялся уронить достоинство свое и чувствовал необходимость возражать; но, как человек, он сжимался нравственно перед забытьем беспричинного гнева, в котором, очевидно, находился Наполеон. Он знал, что все слова, сказанные теперь Наполеоном, не имеют значения, что он сам, когда опомнится, устыдится их. Балашев стоял, опустив глаза, глядя на движущиеся толстые ноги Наполеона, и старался избегать его взгляда.","To each of Napoleon's phrases, Balashev wanted and had something to object to; he incessantly made the gesture of a man who wanted to say something, but Napoleon interrupted him. For example, about the madness of the Swedes, Balashev wanted to say that Sweden is an island when Russia is for it; but Napoleon cried out angrily to drown out his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritation in which one must speak, speak, and speak, only in order to prove to oneself one's justice. It became hard for Balashev: he, as an ambassador, was afraid to drop his dignity and felt the need to object; but, like a man, he shrunk morally before forgetting the unreasonable anger in which, obviously, Napoleon was. He knew that all the words now spoken by Napoleon were of no importance, that he himself, when he came to his senses, would be ashamed of them. Balashev stood with lowered eyes, looking at Napoleon's moving thick legs, and tried to avoid his gaze.","To each of Napoleon's phrases, Balashov could and would have objected; he continually made the movement of a man who wishes to say something, but Napoleon interrupted him. For instance, about the madness of the Swedes, Balashov was about to say that Sweden was an island when Russia backed her; but Napoleon cried out angrily to stifle his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritation in which a man has to talk and talk and talk, only so as to prove his rightness to himself. It was becoming oppressive for Balashov: as an envoy, he was afraid of losing his dignity and felt it necessary to object; but as a human being he shrank morally before the oblivion of groundless wrath in which Napoleon obviously found himself. He knew that all the words Napoleon was now saying meant nothing, that he would be ashamed of them himself once he came to his senses. Balashov stood, his eyes lowered, looking at the movements of Napoleon's fat legs, and tried to avoid his gaze.","Balashov knew how to reply to each of Napoleon’s remarks, and would have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the alleged insanity of the Swedes, Balashov wished to reply that when Russia is on her side Sweden is practically an island; but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is in the right. Balashov began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but as a man he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses. Balashov stood with downcast eyes, looking at the movements of Napoleon’s stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes."

"— А любовь к ближнему, а самопожертвование? — заговорил Пьер. — Нет, я с вами не могу согласиться! Жить только так, чтобы не делать зла, чтоб не раскаиваться? этого мало. Я жил так, я жил для себя и погубил свою жизнь. И только теперь, когда я живу, по крайней мере, стараюсь (из скромности поправился Пьер) жить для других, только теперь я понял всё счастие жизни. Нет я не соглашусь с вами, да и вы не думаете того, что вы говорите.","What about love of neighbor and self-sacrifice? Pierre spoke up. No, I can't agree with you!

"«Нет, не будет этого счастья, думал Ростов, а что бы стоило! Не будет! Мне всегда, и в картах, и на войне, во всем несчастье». Аустерлиц и Долохов ярко, но быстро сменяясь, мелькали в его воображении. «Только один раз бы в жизни затравить матерого волка, больше я не желаю!» думал он, напрягая слух и зрение, оглядываясь налево и опять направо и прислушиваясь к малейшим оттенкам звуков гона. Он взглянул опять направо и увидал, что по пустынному полю навстречу к нему бежало что-то. «Нет, это не может быть!» подумал Ростов, тяжело вздыхая, как вздыхает человек при совершении того, что было долго ожидаемо им. Совершилось величайшее счастье — и так просто, без шума, без блеска, без ознаменования. Ростов не верил своим глазам и сомнение это продолжалось более секунды. Волк бежал вперед и перепрыгнул тяжело рытвину, которая была на его дороге. Это был старый зверь, с седою спиной и с наеденным красноватым брюхом. Он бежал не торопливо, очевидно убежденный, что никто не видит его. Ростов не дыша оглянулся на собак. Они лежали, стояли, не видя волка и ничего не понимая. Старый Карай, завернув голову и оскалив желтые зубы, сердито отыскивая блоху, щелкал ими на задних ляжках.","“No, there won’t be this happiness,” thought Rostov, but what would it cost! Will not be! I always, and in the cards, and in the war, in all misfortune. Austerlitz and Dolokhov brightly, but quickly changing, flickered in his imagination. “Only once in my life to hunt a hardened wolf, I don’t want more!” he thought, straining his hearing and eyesight, looking to the left and again to the right, and listening to the slightest nuances of the sounds of the rut. He looked again to the right and saw that something was running towards him across the deserted field. ""No, it can't be!"" thought Rostov, sighing heavily, as a man sighs when doing what he has long expected. The greatest happiness was accomplished - and so simply, without noise, without brilliance, without commemoration. Rostov did not believe his eyes, and this doubt lasted more than a second. The wolf ran ahead and jumped heavily over the pothole that was in his path. It was an old beast, with a gray back and a reddish belly that was eaten. He ran slowly, apparently convinced that no one was watching him. Rostov looked round at the dogs without breathing. They lay, stood, not seeing the wolf and not understanding anything. Old Karay, turning his head and baring his yellow teeth, angrily looking for a flea, clicked them on his hind thighs.","“No, such luck is not to be,” thought Rostov, “and yet what would it cost? It's not to be! I'm always unlucky, in cards, in war, in everything.” Austerlitz and Dolokhov vividly but fleetingly flashed in his imagination. “If only once in my life I could chase down a seasoned wolf, I'd ask for nothing more!” he thought, straining his hearing and sight, looking to the left and then to the right, and listening to the smallest nuances in the sounds of the chase. He again looked to the right and saw that something was running towards him across the empty field. “No, it can't be!” thought Rostov, sighing deeply, as a man sighs at the accomplishment of something he has long awaited. What was accomplished was his greatest happiness—and so simply, without noise, without splendor, without portent. Rostov could not believe his eyes, and this doubt continued for more than a second. The wolf ran on and jumped heavily over a hole that lay in his path. He was an old beast, with a gray back and a well-stuffed, reddish belly. He ran unhurriedly, obviously convinced that no one could see him. Rostov, holding his breath, glanced at the dogs. They were lying down or standing, not seeing the wolf and understanding nothing. Old Karai turned his head and, baring his yellow teeth, clacked them along his haunch, angrily searching for a flea.","‘No, I won’t have such luck,’ thought Rostov, ‘yet what wouldn’t it be worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards and in war, I am always unlucky.’ Memories of Austerlitz and of Dolokhov flashed rapidly and clearly through his mind. ‘Only once in my life to get an old wolf, I want only that!’ thought he, straining eyes and ears and looking to the left and then to the right, and listening to the slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs. Again he looked to the right, and saw something running towards him across the deserted field. ‘No, it can’t be!’ thought Rostov taking a deep breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for. The height of happiness was reached—and so simply, without warning, or noise, or display, that Rostov could not believe his eyes and remained in doubt for over a second. The wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over a gully that lay in her path. She was an old animal, with a grey back and big reddish belly. She ran without hurry, evidently feeling sure that no one saw her. Rostov, holding his breath, looked round at the borzois. They stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation. Old Karay had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas, baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs. ‘Ulyulyulyu!’"

"Наташа сидела всё время молча, исподлобья глядя на него. Взгляд этот всё больше и больше, и беспокоил, и смущал Бориса. Он чаще оглядывался на Наташу и прерывался в рассказах. Он просидел не больше 10 минут и встал, раскланиваясь. Всё те же любопытные, вызывающие и несколько насмешливые глаза смотрели на него. После первого своего посещения, Борис сказал себе, что Наташа для него точно так же привлекательна, как и прежде, но что он не должен отдаваться этому чувству, потому что женитьба на ней — девушке почти без состояния, — была бы гибелью его карьеры, а возобновление прежних отношений без цели женитьбы было бы неблагородным поступком. Борис решил сам с собою избегать встреч с Наташей, нo, несмотря на это решение, приехал через несколько дней и стал ездить часто и целые дни проводить у Ростовых. Ему представлялось, что ему необходимо было объясниться с Наташей, сказать ей, что всё старое должно быть забыто, что, несмотря на всё… она не может быть его женой, что у него нет состояния, и ее никогда не отдадут за него. Но ему всё не удавалось и неловко было приступить к этому объяснению. С каждым днем он более и более запутывался. Наташа, по замечанию матери и Сони, казалась по старому влюбленной в Бориса. Она пела ему его любимые песни, показывала ему свой альбом, заставляла его писать в него, не позволяла поминать ему о старом, давая понимать, как прекрасно было новое; и каждый день он уезжал в тумане, не сказав того, что намерен был сказать, сам не зная, что он делал и для чего он приезжал, и чем это кончится. Борис перестал бывать у Элен, ежедневно получал укоризненные записки от нее и всё-таки целые дни проводил у Ростовых.","Natasha sat all the time in silence, looking at him from under her brows. This look more and more disturbed and embarrassed Boris. He often looked back at Natasha and interrupted his stories. He sat for no more than 10 minutes and stood up, bowing. All the same curious, defiant and somewhat mocking eyes looked at him. After his first visit, Boris told himself that Natasha was just as attractive to him as before, but that he should not give in to this feeling, because marrying her - a girl with almost no fortune - would be the death of his career, and resuming the old relationship without the purpose of marriage would be an ignoble act. Boris decided on his own to avoid meeting Natasha, but, despite this decision, he arrived a few days later and began to travel often and spend whole days with the Rostovs. It seemed to him that he needed to explain himself to Natasha, to tell her that everything old should be forgotten, that, despite everything ... she cannot be his wife, that he has no fortune, and she will never be given for him. But he did not succeed in everything and it was embarrassing to start this explanation. Every day he became more and more confused. Natasha, according to the remark of her mother and Sonya, seemed to be in love with Boris in the old way. She sang his favorite songs to him, showed him her album, forced him to write in it, did not allow him to remember the old, letting him know how wonderful the new was; and every day he left in a fog, without saying what he intended to say, not knowing himself what he was doing and why he came, and how it would end. Boris stopped visiting Helen, received daily reproachful notes from her, and yet spent whole days with the Rostovs.","Natasha sat silently all the while, gazing at him from under her brows. This gaze disturbed and embarrassed Boris more and more. He interrupted his conversation and turned to look at Natasha more frequently. He stayed for no more than ten minutes and got up, bowing his way out. The same curious, defiant, and somewhat mocking eyes were looking at him. After his first visit, Boris said to himself that he found Natasha as attractive as ever, but that he was not going to give in to that feeling, because to marry her—a girl with almost no fortune—would be to ruin his career, and to renew their former relations without aiming at marriage would be an ignoble thing to do. Boris decided in himself to avoid meeting Natasha, but, despite that decision, came a few days later and began to visit often and spend whole days at the Rostovs'. He fancied he had to have a talk with Natasha, to tell her that all the old things must be forgotten, that despite all ... she could not be his wife, that he had no fortune, and she would never be allowed to marry him. But he kept failing and felt awkward about starting this talk. He became more and more entangled every day. Natasha, in her mother's and Sonya's observation, seemed to be as in love with Boris as before. She sang his favorite songs for him, showed him her album, made him write in it, and did not allow him to talk about old things, giving him to understand how beautiful the new things were; and every day he left in a fog, without having said what he meant to say, not knowing himself what he was doing, or why he came, or how it would end. Boris stopped frequenting Hélène, received reproachful notes from her, and even so spent whole days at the Rostovs'.","All this time Natasha sat silent, glancing up at him from under her brows. This gaze disturbed and confused Boris more and more. He looked round more frequently towards her, and broke off in what he was saying. He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave. The same inquisitive, challenging, and rather mocking eyes still looked at him. After his first visit Boris said to himself that Natasha attracted him just as much as ever, but that he must not yield to that feeling, because to marry her, a girl almost without fortune, would mean ruin to his career, while to renew their former relations without intending to marry her would be dishonourable. Boris made up his mind to avoid meeting Natasha, but despite that resolution he called again a few days later, and began calling often and spending whole days at the Rostovs’. It seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with Natasha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten, that in spite of everything … she could not be his wife, that he had no means, and they would never let her marry him. But he failed to do so, and felt awkward about entering on such an explanation. From day to day he became more and more entangled. It seemed to her mother and Sonya that Natasha was in love with Boris as of old. She sang him his favourite songs, showed him her album, making him write in it, did not allow him to allude to the past, letting it be understood how delightful was the present; and every day he went away in a fog, without having said what he meant to, and not knowing what he was doing or why he came, or how it would all end. He left off visiting Hélène and received reproachful notes from her every day, and yet he continued to spend whole days with the Rostovs."
"— А помнишь, мы говорили с тобой про игру… дурак, кто на счастье хочет играть; играть надо наверное, а я хочу попробовать.","- Do you remember, we talked about the game with you ... a fool who wants to play for luck; I should probably play, but I want to try.","“Remember, we talked once about gambling ... he's a fool who wants to gamble on luck; gambling needs certainty, but I want to try it.”","‘Do you remember we had a talk about cards … “He’s a fool who trusts to luck, one should make certain,” and I want to try.’"

"Взорванный словом интригантка, Николай, возвысив голос, сказал матери, что он никогда не думал, чтобы она заставляла его продавать свои чувства, и что ежели это так, то он последний раз говорит… Но он не успел сказать того решительного слова, которого, судя по выражению его лица, с ужасом ждала мать и которое может быть навсегда бы осталось жестоким воспоминанием между ними. Он не успел договорить, потому что Наташа с бледным и серьезным лицом вошла в комнату от двери, у которой она подслушивала.","Blown up by the word intriguer, Nikolai, raising his voice, told his mother that he had never thought that she would force him to sell his feelings, and that if this was so, then he would say the last time ... But he did not have time to say that decisive word, which, judging by according to the expression of his face, his mother waited with horror and which, perhaps, would forever remain a cruel memory between them. He did not have time to finish, because Natasha with a pale and serious face entered the room from the door at which she was eavesdropping.","At the word intriguer, Nikolai exploded, raised his voice, and said to his mother that he had never thought she would make him sell his feelings, and that if it was so, he was saying for the last time ...

"В фигуре, где ему надо было выбирать дам, шепнув Элен, что он хочет взять графиню Потоцкую, которая, кажется, вышла на балкон, он, скользя ногами по паркету, выбежал в выходную дверь в сад и, заметив входящего с Балашевым на террасу государя, приостановился.

"При начале мазурки Борис видел, что генерал-адъютант Балашев, одно из ближайших лиц к государю, подошел к нему и непридворно остановился близко от государя, говорившего с польской дамой. Поговорив с дамой, государь взглянул вопросительно и, видно, поняв, что Балашев поступил так только потому, что на то были важные причины, слегка кивнул даме и обратился к Балашеву. Только что Балашев начал говорить, как удивление выразилось на лице государя. Он взял под руку Балашева и пошел с ним через залу, бессознательно для себя расчищая с обеих сторон сажени на три широкую дорогу сторонившихся перед ним. Борис заметил взволнованное лицо Аракчеева, в то время как государь пошел с Балашевым. Аракчеев, исподлобья глядя на государя и посапывая красным носом, выдвинулся из толпы, как бы ожидая, что государь обратится к нему. (Борис понял, что Аракчеев завидует Балашеву и недоволен тем, что какая-то, очевидно, важная, новость не через него передана государю.)","At the beginning of the mazurka, Boris saw that the adjutant general Balashev, one of the closest persons to the sovereign, approached him and stopped in a courtly manner close to the sovereign, who was talking to a Polish lady. After talking with the lady, the emperor looked inquiringly and, evidently realizing that Balashev did so only because there were important reasons for this, nodded slightly to the lady and turned to Balashev. Balashev had just begun to speak, as surprise was expressed on the sovereign's face. He took Balashev's arm and walked with him through the hall, unconsciously clearing sazhens on both sides of the three broad roads that stood aside before him. Boris noticed the agitated face of Arakcheev, while the sovereign went with Balashev. Arakcheev, looking frowningly at the sovereign and sniffing his red nose, moved out of the crowd, as if expecting the sovereign to turn to him. (Boris realized that Arakcheev was jealous of Balashev and was dissatisfied with the fact that some, obviously important, news was not transmitted to the sovereign through him.)","At the start of the mazurka, Boris saw the adjutant general Balashov, one of the closest persons to the sovereign, go up to him and in uncourtly fashion stop very close to the sovereign, who was talking with a Polish lady.

As soon as Balashov began to speak, the sovereign's face showed astonishment. He took Balashov by the arm and walked across the room with him, unconsciously clearing a seven-yard path for himself on both sides as people made way for him. Boris noticed Arakcheev's troubled face as the sovereign walked with Balashov. Arakcheev, glancing at the sovereign from under his eyebrows and puffing through his red nose, stepped out from the crowd, as if expecting the sovereign to address him.

"— Как видно, Nicolas! — сказал голос Сони. — Николай оглянулся на Соню и пригнулся, чтоб ближе рассмотреть ее лицо. Какое-то совсем новое, милое, лицо, с черными бровями и усами, в лунном свете, близко и далеко, выглядывало из соболей.","“As you can see, Nicolas! Sonya's voice said.

"— Вот не ждал, очень рад, — сказал князь Андрей. Пьер ничего не говорил; он удивленно, не спуская глаз, смотрел на своего друга. Его поразила происшедшая перемена в князе Андрее. Слова были ласковы, улыбка была на губах и лице князя Андрея, но взгляд был потухший, мертвый, которому, несмотря на видимое желание, князь Андрей не мог придать радостного и веселого блеска. Не то, что похудел, побледнел, возмужал его друг; но взгляд этот и морщинка на лбу, выражавшие долгое сосредоточение на чем-то одном, поражали и отчуждали Пьера, пока он не привык к ним.","“I didn’t expect it, I’m very glad,” said Prince Andrei. Pierre did not say anything; he stared at his friend in astonishment, not taking his eyes off him. He was struck by the change that had taken place in Prince Andrei. The words were affectionate, there was a smile on the lips and face of Prince Andrei, but his eyes were dead, dead, to which, despite his apparent desire, Prince Andrei could not give a joyful and cheerful brilliance. Not that he lost weight, turned pale, his friend matured; but this look and the wrinkle on the forehead, expressing a long concentration on one thing, amazed and alienated Pierre until he got used to them.","“How unexpected, I'm very glad,” said Prince Andrei. Pierre said nothing; he looked at his friend in astonishment and could not take his eyes off him. He was struck by the change that had taken place in Prince Andrei. His words were affectionate, there was a smile on Prince Andrei's lips and face, but his gaze was extinguished, dead, and despite his obvious desire, Prince Andrei could not give it a joyful and merry luster. It was not that his friend had grown thinner, paler, more mature; it was this gaze and the wrinkle on his forehead, expressive of a long concentration on some one thing, which struck and alienated Pierre, until he got used to them.","‘Well, I did not expect you, I am very glad,’ said Prince Andrei. Pierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise. He was struck by the change in him. His words were kindly and there was a smile on his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and glad sparkle. Prince Andrei had grown thinner, paler, and more masculine looking, but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used to it was his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought."
"— Ах, сударыня, — заговорил он, — сударыня, графиня… графиня Ростова, коли не ошибаюсь… прошу извинить, извинить… не знал, сударыня.

Извинить прошу… видит Бог не знал, — повторил он так не натурально, ударяя на слово Бог и так неприятно, что княжна Марья стояла, опустив глаза, не смея взглянуть ни на отца, ни на Наташу.

God doesn’t know, he repeated so unnaturally, emphasizing the word God and so unpleasantly that Princess Mary stood with her eyes downcast, not daring to look either at her father or at Natasha. Natasha, having risen and sat down, also did not know what to do. One m-lle Bourienne smiled pleasantly.","“Ah, Miss,” he said, “Miss, Countess... Countess Rostov, if I'm not mistaken ...

Natasha, having risen and curtsied, also did not know what to do with herself. Mlle Bourienne alone smiled pleasantly.","‘Ah, madam!’ he began. ‘ Madam, Countess … Countess Rostova, if I am not mistaken … I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me … I did not know, madam.

"В назначенный час обеда, однако, князь Андрей уже входил в собственный, небольшой дом Сперанского у Таврического сада. В паркетной столовой небольшого домика, отличавшегося необыкновенной чистотой (напоминающей монашескую чистоту) князь Андрей, несколько опоздавший, уже нашел в пять часов собравшееся всё общество этого petit comite, интимных знакомых Сперанского. Дам не было никого кроме маленькой дочери Сперанского (с длинным лицом, похожим на отца) и ее гувернантки. Гости были Жерве, Магницкий и Столыпин.

"Возвратившись из своей поездки, князь Андрей решился осенью ехать в Петербург и придумал разные причины этого решенья. Целый ряд разумных, логических доводов, почему ему необходимо ехать в Петербург и даже служить, ежеминутно был готов к его услугам. Он даже теперь не понимал, как мог он когда-нибудь сомневаться в необходимости принять деятельное участие в жизни, точно так же как месяц тому назад он не понимал, как могла бы ему притти мысль уехать из деревни. Ему казалось ясно, что все его опыты жизни должны были пропасть даром и быть бессмыслицей, ежели бы он не приложил их к делу и не принял опять деятельного участия в жизни. Он даже не понимал того, как на основании таких же бедных разумных доводов прежде очевидно было, что он бы унизился, ежели бы теперь после своих уроков жизни опять бы поверил в возможность приносить пользу и в возможность счастия и любви. Теперь разум подсказывал совсем другое. После этой поездки князь Андрей стал скучать в деревне, прежние занятия не интересовали его, и часто, сидя один в своем кабинете, он вставал, подходил к зеркалу и долго смотрел на свое лицо. Потом он отворачивался и смотрел на портрет покойницы Лизы, которая с взбитыми a la grecque [по гречески] буклями нежно и весело смотрела на него из золотой рамки. Она уже не говорила мужу прежних страшных слов, она просто и весело с любопытством смотрела на него. И князь Андрей, заложив назад руки, долго ходил по комнате, то хмурясь, то улыбаясь, передумывая те неразумные, невыразимые словом, тайные как преступление мысли, связанные с Пьером, с славой, с девушкой на окне, с дубом, с женской красотой и любовью, которые изменили всю его жизнь. И в эти-то минуты, когда кто входил к нему, он бывал особенно сух, строго-решителен и в особенности неприятно-логичен.","Returning from his trip, Prince Andrei decided to go to Petersburg in the fall and came up with various reasons for this decision. A whole series of reasonable, logical arguments why he needed to go to Petersburg and even serve, was every minute ready for his services. Even now he did not understand how he could ever doubt the need to take an active part in life, just as a month ago he did not understand how the idea of leaving the village could come to him. It seemed clear to him that all his experiences in life must have been lost in vain and be nonsense if he had not put them to work and had not again taken an active part in life. He did not even understand how, on the basis of the same poor rational arguments, it had previously been obvious that he would have humiliated himself if now, after his lessons in life, he would again believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness and love. Now my mind was telling me something else. After this trip, Prince Andrei began to get bored in the countryside, his previous activities did not interest him, and often, sitting alone in his office, he got up, went to the mirror and looked at his face for a long time. Then he turned away and looked at the portrait of the deceased Lisa, who, with curls a la grecque [in Greek] fluffed up, tenderly and cheerfully looked at him from a golden frame. She no longer spoke the former terrible words to her husband, she simply and cheerfully looked at him with curiosity. And Prince Andrei, with his hands folded back, paced the room for a long time, now frowning, now smiling, rethinking those unreasonable, inexpressible in words, secret as a crime thoughts connected with Pierre, with fame, with the girl at the window, with the oak, with female beauty and love that changed his whole life. And at those moments, when someone came to him, he was especially dry, sternly resolute, and especially unpleasantly logical.","Having returned from this trip, Prince Andrei decided to go to Petersburg in the fall, and thought up various reasons for this decision. A whole series of reasonable, logical arguments for why it was necessary that he go to Petersburg and even serve, was at his disposal every moment. He did not even understand now how he could ever have doubted the necessity of taking an active part in life, just as a month earlier he had not understood how it could ever occur to him to leave the country. It seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must go for naught and be meaningless, if he did not put it to work and again take an active part in life. He did not even understand how, on the basis of such poor rational arguments, it could have been obvious before that he would humiliate himself if now, after his lessons in life, he should again believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness and love. Now reason suggested something quite different. After his journey, Prince Andrei began to be bored in the country, his former occupations did not interest him, and often, sitting alone in his study, he would get up, go to the mirror, and look at his face for a long time. Then he would turn away and look at the portrait of the late Liza, who, with her hair curled à la grecque, looked at him tenderly and cheerfully from the gilt frame. She no longer said terrible words to her husband as before, she looked at him simply and cheerfully with curiosity. And Prince Andrei, putting his hands behind his back, would pace the room for a long time, now frowning, now smiling, thinking over those irrational thoughts, inexpressible in words, secret as a crime, that were connected with Pierre, with glory, with the girl on the windowsill, with the oak, with feminine beauty and love, which had changed his whole life. In those moments, if anyone came into his room, he was particularly dry, stern, resolute, and, in particular, unpleasantly logical.","On reaching home Prince Andrei decided to go to Petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision. A whole series of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go to Petersburg, and even to re-enter the service, kept springing up in his mind. He could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life, just as a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head. It now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again played an active part in life. He did not even remember how formerly, on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments, it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now, after the lessons he had had in life, allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or love. Now reason suggested quite the opposite. After that journey to Ryazan he found the country dull; his former pursuits no longer interested him, and often when sitting alone in his study he got up, went to the mirror and gazed a long time at his own face. Then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead Liza, who with hair curled à la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame. She did not now say those former terrible words to him, but looked simply, merrily, and inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrei, crossing his arms behind him, long paced the room, now frowning now smiling, as he reflected on those irrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as a crime, which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre, with fame, with the girl at the window, the oak, and woman’s beauty and love. And if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold, stern, and above all, unpleasantly logical."

"Вернувшись домой, князь Андрей стал вспоминать свою петербургскую жизнь за эти четыре месяца, как будто что-то новое. Он вспоминал свои хлопоты, искательства, историю своего проекта военного устава, который был принят к сведению и о котором старались умолчать единственно потому, что другая работа, очень дурная, была уже сделана и представлена государю; вспомнил о заседаниях комитета, членом которого был Берг; вспомнил, как в этих заседаниях старательно и продолжительно обсуживалось всё касающееся формы и процесса заседаний комитета, и как старательно и кратко обходилось всё что касалось сущности дела. Он вспомнил о своей законодательной работе, о том, как он озабоченно переводил на русский язык статьи римского и французского свода, и ему стало совестно за себя. Потом он живо представил себе Богучарово, свои занятия в деревне, свою поездку в Рязань, вспомнил мужиков, Дрона-старосту, и приложив к ним права лиц, которые он распределял по параграфам, ему стало удивительно, как он мог так долго заниматься такой праздной работой.","Returning home, Prince Andrei began to recall his Petersburg life during these four months, as if something new. He recalled his efforts, searches, the history of his draft military regulations, which was taken into account and about which they tried to keep silent solely because another work, very bad, had already been done and presented to the sovereign; remembered the meetings of the committee, of which Berg was a member; I recalled how diligently and at length everything relating to the form and process of committee meetings was discussed in these meetings, and how diligently and briefly everything related to the essence of the matter was avoided. He remembered his legislative work, how he anxiously translated articles of the Roman and French code into Russian, and he felt ashamed of himself. Then he vividly imagined Bogucharovo, his activities in the village, his trip to Ryazan, remembered the peasants, Drona the headman, and applying to them the rights of persons, which he divided into paragraphs, he wondered how he could have been engaged in such idle work for so long. .","On returning home, Prince Andrei began to recall his Petersburg life of those last four months as if it was something new.

"Перонская была уже готова. Несмотря на ее старость и некрасивость, у нее происходило точно то же, что у Ростовых, хотя не с такой торопливостью (для нее это было дело привычное), но также было надушено, вымыто, напудрено старое, некрасивое тело, также старательно промыто за ушами, и даже, и так же, как у Ростовых, старая горничная восторженно любовалась нарядом своей госпожи, когда она в желтом платье с шифром вышла в гостиную. Перонская похвалила туалеты Ростовых.","Peronskaya was already ready. Despite her old age and ugliness, she had exactly the same thing as the Rostovs, although not with such haste (for her it was a habitual thing), but her old, ugly body was also perfumed, washed, powdered, also carefully washed behind the ears , and even, and just like at the Rostovs, the old maid enthusiastically admired the outfit of her mistress when she went into the living room in a yellow dress with a cipher. Peronskaya praised the Rostovs' toilets.","Mme Peronsky was ready. Despite her old age and unattractiveness, the same things had gone on with her as at the Rostovs', though not as hurriedly (it was a habitual thing for her).

"Анатоль встал и вошел в столовую. Балага был известный троечный ямщик, уже лет шесть знавший Долохова и Анатоля, и служивший им своими тройками. Не раз он, когда полк Анатоля стоял в Твери, с вечера увозил его из Твери, к рассвету доставлял в Москву и увозил на другой день ночью. Не раз он увозил Долохова от погони, не раз он по городу катал их с цыганами и дамочками, как называл Балага. Не раз он с их работой давил по Москве народ и извозчиков, и всегда его выручали его господа, как он называл их. Не одну лошадь он загнал под ними. Не раз он был бит ими, не раз напаивали они его шампанским и мадерой, которую он любил, и не одну штуку он знал за каждым из них, которая обыкновенному человеку давно бы заслужила Сибирь. В кутежах своих они часто зазывали Балагу, заставляли его пить и плясать у цыган, и не одна тысяча их денег перешла через его руки. Служа им, он двадцать раз в году рисковал и своей жизнью и своей шкурой, и на их работе переморил больше лошадей, чем они ему переплатили денег. Но он любил их, любил эту безумную езду, по восемнадцати верст в час, любил перекувырнуть извозчика и раздавить пешехода по Москве, и во весь скок пролететь по московским улицам. Он любил слышать за собой этот дикий крик пьяных голосов: «пошел! пошел!» тогда как уж и так нельзя было ехать шибче; любил вытянуть больно по шее мужика, который и так ни жив, ни мертв сторонился от него. «Настоящие господа!» думал он.","Anatole got up and went into the dining room.

More than once he took Dolokhov away from the chase, more than once he drove them around the city with gypsies and ladies, as Balaga called. More than once, with their work, he crushed the people and cabbies around Moscow, and his gentlemen, as he called them, always rescued him. He drove more than one horse under them. More than once he was beaten by them, more than once they made him drunk with champagne and Madeira, which he loved, and he knew more than one thing behind each of them, which Siberia would have long deserved for an ordinary person. In their carousing, they often called Balaga, forced him to drink and dance with the gypsies, and more than one thousand of their money passed through his hands. In their service, he risked both his life and his skin twenty times a year, and in their work he overworked more horses than they overpaid him. But he loved them, he loved this crazy ride, eighteen miles an hour, he loved to overturn a cab and crush a pedestrian in Moscow, and fly at full speed through Moscow streets. He loved to hear this wild cry of drunken voices behind him: “Let's go! gone!” while it was already impossible to go any faster; he liked to stretch painfully up the neck of the peasant, who, in any case, was neither dead nor alive, shunned him.

"— Ну, Господи благослови, — проговорил граф, полу-шутя, полу-серьезно; но Наташа заметила, что отец ее заторопился, входя в переднюю, и робко, тихо спросил, дома ли князь и княжна. После доклада о их приезде между прислугой князя произошло смятение. Лакей, побежавший докладывать о них, был остановлен другим лакеем в зале и они шептали о чем-то. В залу выбежала горничная девушка, и торопливо тоже говорила что-то, упоминая о княжне. Наконец один старый, с сердитым видом лакей вышел и доложил Ростовым, что князь принять не может, а княжна просит к себе. Первая навстречу гостям вышла m-lle Bourienne. Она особенно учтиво встретила отца с дочерью и проводила их к княжне. Княжна с взволнованным, испуганным и покрытым красными пятнами лицом выбежала, тяжело ступая, навстречу к гостям, и тщетно пытаясь казаться свободной и радушной. Наташа с первого взгляда не понравилась княжне Марье. Она ей показалась слишком нарядной, легкомысленно-веселой и тщеславной. Княжна Марья не знала, что прежде, чем она увидала свою будущую невестку, она уже была дурно расположена к ней по невольной зависти к ее красоте, молодости и счастию и по ревности к любви своего брата. Кроме этого непреодолимого чувства антипатии к ней, княжна Марья в эту минуту была взволнована еще тем, что при докладе о приезде Ростовых, князь закричал, что ему их не нужно, что пусть княжна Марья принимает, если хочет, а чтоб к нему их не пускали. Княжна Марья решилась принять Ростовых, но всякую минуту боялась, как бы князь не сделал какую-нибудь выходку, так как он казался очень взволнованным приездом Ростовых.","“Well, God bless,” said the count, half jokingly, half seriously; but Natasha noticed that her father was in a hurry, entering the hall, and timidly, quietly asked if the prince and princess were at home. After the report of their arrival, there was confusion among the servants of the prince. The footman, who ran to report them, was stopped by another footman in the hall, and they were whispering about something. A maid girl ran out into the hall, and hastily also said something, mentioning the princess. Finally, one old, with an angry look, footman came out and reported to the Rostovs that the prince could not accept, but the princess asked to come to her. The first to meet the guests was m-lle Bourienne. She greeted her father and daughter with particular courtesy and escorted them to the princess. The princess, with an agitated, frightened and red-spotted face, ran out, stepping heavily, towards the guests, and in vain trying to appear free and hospitable. Princess Mary did not like Natasha at first sight. She seemed to her too elegant, frivolously cheerful and conceited. Princess Mary did not know that before she saw her future daughter-in-law, she was already ill-disposed towards her out of involuntary envy of her beauty, youth and happiness, and out of jealousy for her brother's love. In addition to this irresistible feeling of antipathy towards her, Princess Marya at that moment was also agitated by the fact that, when reporting on the arrival of the Rostovs, the prince shouted that he did not need them, that let Princess Marya accept if she wanted, but that they should not be allowed to see him . Princess Marya decided to receive the Rostovs, but every minute she was afraid that the prince would do some kind of trick, as he seemed very excited by the arrival of the Rostovs.","“Well, God bless us,” the count said, half jokingly, half seriously; but Natasha noticed that her father was flustered as he stepped into the front hall and asked timidly and softly whether the prince and princess were at home. The announcement of their visit caused a commotion among the prince's servants. The footman who went to announce them was stopped by another footman in the reception room, and they whispered about something. A maid ran out to the reception room and hastily said something as well, mentioning the princess. At last an old footman with an angry look came out and told the Ros-tovs that the prince could not receive them, but the princess asked them to come in. The first to meet the guests was Mlle Bourienne. She met the father and daughter especially courteously and took them to the princess. The princess, her agitated, frightened face covered with red blotches, ran out, treading heavily, to meet the guests, trying in vain to appear casual and affable. Princess Marya disliked Natasha at first sight. She seemed to her too well dressed, flightily merry, and vain. Princess Marya did not know that, before seeing her future sister-in-law, she had already been ill-disposed towards her, being involuntarily envious of her beauty, youth, and happiness, and jealous of her brother's love. Besides this insuperable feeling of antipathy for her, Princess Marya was also troubled just then because, when the arrival of the Rostovs was announced, the prince had cried out that he did not want them, that Princess Marya could receive them if she liked, but that they were not to be admitted to him. Princess Marya had decided to receive the Rostovs, but was afraid every moment that the prince might perform some escapade, being very agitated by the Rostovs' arrival.","‘Well, the Lord have mercy on us!’ said the count, half in jest, half in earnest; but Natasha noticed that her father was flurried on entering the ante-room, and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and princess were at home. When they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the servants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by another in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning the princess. At last an old, cross-looking footman came and announced to the Rostovs that the prince was not receiving, but that the princess begged them to walk up. The first person who came to meet the visitors was Mademoiselle Bourienne. She greeted the father and daughter with special politeness, and showed them to the princess’s room. The princess, looking excited and nervous, her face flushed in patches, ran in to meet the visitors, treading heavily, and vainly trying to appear cordial and at ease. From the first glance Princess Marya did not like Natasha. She thought her too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay, and vain. She did not at all realize that before having seen her future sister-in-law she was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty, youth, and happiness, as well as by jealousy of her brother’s love for her. Apart from this insuperable antipathy to her, Princess Marya was agitated just then because on the Rostovs being announced, the old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them, that Princess Marya might do so if she chose, but they were not to be admitted to him. She had decided to receive them, but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in some freak, as he seemed much upset by the Rostovs’ visit."

"Всё расступилось, и государь, улыбаясь и не в такт ведя за руку хозяйку дома, вышел из дверей гостиной. За ним шли хозяин с М. А. Нарышкиной, потом посланники, министры, разные генералы, которых не умолкая называла Перонская. Больше половины дам имели кавалеров и шли или приготовлялись итти в Польской. Наташа чувствовала, что она оставалась с матерью и Соней в числе меньшей части дам, оттесненных к стене и не взятых в Польской. Она стояла, опустив свои тоненькие руки, и с мерно-поднимающейся, чуть определенной грудью, сдерживая дыхание, блестящими, испуганными глазами глядела перед собой, с выражением готовности на величайшую радость и на величайшее горе. Ее не занимали ни государь, ни все важные лица, на которых указывала Перонская — у ней была одна мысль: «неужели так никто не подойдет ко мне, неужели я не буду танцовать между первыми, неужели меня не заметят все эти мужчины, которые теперь, кажется, и не видят меня, а ежели смотрят на меня, то смотрят с таким выражением, как будто говорят: А! это не она, так и нечего смотреть. Нет, это не может быть!» — думала она. — «Они должны же знать, как мне хочется танцовать, как я отлично танцую, и как им весело будет танцовать со мною».","Everything parted, and the emperor, smiling and leading the mistress of the house out of time by the hand, went out of the doors of the drawing room. He was followed by the owner with M.A. Naryshkina, then envoys, ministers, various generals, whom Peronskaya called incessantly. More than half of the ladies had cavaliers and were walking or preparing to go to Polskaya. Natasha felt that she remained with her mother and Sonya among the smaller part of the ladies pushed back to the wall and not taken in Polskaya. She stood with her slender arms lowered, and with a measuredly rising, slightly defined chest, holding her breath, with shining, frightened eyes, she looked ahead of her, with an expression of readiness for the greatest joy and the greatest grief. She was not interested in either the sovereign or all the important persons that Peronskaya pointed out - she had one thought: “is it really that no one will come up to me, really I won’t dance between the first, really all these men who now, it seems that they don’t see me, and if they look at me, they look with such an expression, as if they say: Ah! it's not her, so there's nothing to see. No, it can't be!"" she thought. “They must know how I want to dance, how well I dance, and how much fun they will dance with me.”","Everyone made way, and the sovereign, smiling and out of step with the music, led the hostess through the drawing-room door. After him came the host with Mme M. A. Naryshkin, then ambassadors, ministers, various generals, whom Mme Peronsky kept naming without pause. More than half of the ladies had partners and were joining or preparing to join the polonaise. Natasha sensed that she would be left with her mother and Sonya among the smaller part of the ladies pushed back against the wall and not asked to the polonaise. She stood, her thin arms lowered, her barely defined bosom rising rhythmically, holding her breath, her shining, frightened eyes looking straight ahead with an expression of readiness either for the greatest happiness or for the greatest grief. She was interested neither in the sovereign nor in any of the important persons Mme Peronsky pointed out— she had one thought: “ Can it be that no one will come up to me , can it be that I won't dance among the first, can it be that all these men won't notice me, who now don't even seem to see me, and if they look at me, it's with such an expression as if they were saying: 'Ah! it's not her, there's no point in looking!' No, it can't be!” she thought. “They must know how I want to dance, and how well I dance, and what fun it will be for them to dance with me.”","Everyone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing-room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music. The host followed with Marya Antonovna Naryshkina; then came ambassadors, ministers, and various generals, whom Peronskaya diligently named. More than half the ladies already had partners and were taking up, or preparing to take up, their positions for the polonaise. Natasha felt that she would be left with her mother and Sonya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall, not having been invited to dance. She stood with her slender arms hanging down, her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly, and with bated breath and glittering, frightened eyes gazed straight before her, evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery. She was not concerned about the Emperor, or any of those great people whom Peronskaya was pointing out—she had but one thought: ‘Is it possible no one will ask me, that I shall not be among the first to dance? Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me? They do not even seem to see me, or if they do, they look as if they were saying, “Ah, she’s not the one I’m after, so it’s not worth looking at her!” No, it’s impossible,’ she thought. ‘They must know how I long to dance, how splendidly I dance, and how they would enjoy dancing with me.’"

"Анатоль, как справедливо говорил про него Шиншин, с тех пор как приехал в Москву, сводил с ума всех московских барынь в особенности тем, что он пренебрегал ими и очевидно предпочитал им цыганок и французских актрис, с главою которых — mademoiselle Georges, как говорили, он был в близких сношениях. Он не пропускал ни одного кутежа у Данилова и других весельчаков Москвы, напролет пил целые ночи, перепивая всех, и бывал на всех вечерах и балах высшего света. Рассказывали про несколько интриг его с московскими дамами, и на балах он ухаживал за некоторыми. Но с девицами, в особенности с богатыми невестами, которые были большей частью все дурны, он не сближался, тем более, что Анатоль, чего никто не знал, кроме самых близких друзей его, был два года тому назад женат. Два года тому назад, во время стоянки его полка в Польше, один польский небогатый помещик заставил Анатоля жениться на своей дочери.","Anatole, as Shinshin rightly said about him, since he arrived in Moscow, drove all Moscow ladies crazy, especially by the fact that he neglected them and obviously preferred gypsies and French actresses to them, with the head of which - mademoiselle Georges, as they said, he was in close contact. He did not miss a single revelry at Danilov's and other merry fellows of Moscow, he drank all night long, drinking everyone, and visited all the evenings and balls of high society. There were stories about several of his intrigues with Moscow ladies, and at balls he courted some of them. But with girls, especially with rich brides, who were for the most part all bad, he did not get close, especially since Anatole, which no one knew except his closest friends, was married two years ago. Two years ago, while his regiment was stationed in Poland, a poor Polish landowner forced Anatole to marry his daughter.","Anatole, as Shinshin rightly said of him, had driven all the Moscow ladies out of their minds ever since his arrival, especially by neglecting them and apparently preferring Gypsy women and French actresses, with the foremost of whom , Mlle George, he was said to be in intimate relations. He never missed a single carouse at Dolokhov's and at other Moscow merrymakers', drank all night long, outdrank everybody, and attended all the high society soirées and balls. There was talk of several intrigues of his with Moscow ladies, and at balls he paid court to some. But he never approached young girls, especially rich, marriageable ones, who were for the most part plain, the less so in that Anatole—something no one but his closest friends knew—had gotten married two years before. Two years before, while his regiment was stationed in Poland, a modest Polish landowner had forced Anatole to marry his daughter.","As Shinshin had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had turned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that he slighted them and plainly preferred the gipsy-girls and French actresses—with the chief of whom, Mademoiselle Georges, he was said to be in intimate relations. He never missed a carousal at Danilov’s or other Moscow revellers’, drank whole nights through, outvying everyone else, and was at all the balls and parties of the best society. There was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies, and he flirted with a few of them at the balls. But he did not run after the unmarried girls, especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain. There was a special reason for this, as he had got married two years before—a fact known only to his most intimate friends. At that time, while with his regiment in Poland, a Polish landowner of small means had forced him to marry his daughter."

Ну скажите, граф, справедливо это, честно это со стороны Безухова? А Федя по своему благородству любил его, и теперь никогда ничего дурного про него не говорит. В Петербурге эти шалости с квартальным там что-то шутили, ведь они вместе делали? Что ж, Безухову ничего, а Федя все на своих плечах перенес! Ведь что он перенес! Положим, возвратили, да ведь как же и не возвратить? Я думаю таких, как он, храбрецов и сынов отечества не много там было. Что ж теперь — эта дуэль! Есть ли чувство, честь у этих людей! Зная, что он единственный сын, вызвать на дуэль и стрелять так прямо! Хорошо, что Бог помиловал нас. И за что же? Ну кто же в наше время не имеет интриги? Что ж, коли он так ревнив? Я понимаю, ведь он прежде мог дать почувствовать, а то год ведь продолжалось. И что же, вызвал на дуэль, полагая, что Федя не будет драться, потому что он ему должен. Какая низость! Какая гадость! Я знаю, вы Федю поняли, мой милый граф, оттого-то я вас душой люблю, верьте мне. Его редкие понимают. Это такая высокая, небесная душа!","“Yes, count, he is too noble and pure in soul,” she used to say, “for our present, corrupted world. No one likes virtue, it pricks everyone's eyes.

In St. Petersburg, these pranks with the quarterly were joking there, because they did it together? Well, nothing to Bezukhov, but Fedya endured everything on his shoulders! After all, what did he endure! Let's say they returned it, but why not return it? I think there were not many brave men and sons of the fatherland like him. Well now - this duel! Do these people have a sense of honor! Knowing that he is the only son, challenge him to a duel and shoot so straight! It's good that God has mercy on us. And for what? Well, who in our time does not have intrigue? Well, if he is so jealous? I understand, because before he could make you feel, otherwise the year went on. And well, he challenged him to a duel, believing that Fedya would not fight, because he owed him. What meanness! That's disgusting! I know you understand Fedya, my dear Count, that's why I love you with my soul, believe me. Few people understand him.

Do these people have any feeling, any honor? To challenge him to a duel, knowing he's an only son, and shoot straight at him! It's a good thing God was merciful to us. And for what?

Bezukhov got off scot free, while Fedya had to bear the whole burden on his shoulders. Imagine what he had to go through! It’s true he has been reinstated, but how could they fail to do that? I think there were not many such gallant sons of the Fatherland out there as he. And now—this duel! Have these people no feeling, or honour? Knowing him to be an only son, to challenge him and shoot so straight! It’s a good thing God had mercy on us. And what was it for? Who doesn’t have intrigues nowadays? Why, if he was so jealous, as I see things he should have shown it sooner, but he lets it go on for months. And then to call him out, reckoning on Fedya not fighting because he owed him money! What baseness! What meanness! I know you understand Fedya, my dear Count , that, believe me, is why I am so fond of you. Few people do understand him. His is such a lofty, heavenly soul!’"

I had such moments myself not long ago, in Moscow and when travelling, but at such times I collapse so that I don’t live at all—everything seems hateful to me … myself most of all.

"— Видно плетью обуха не пег'ешибешь, — сказал он, отходя от окна и подавая Ростову большой конверт. — Это была просьба на имя государя, составленная аудитором, в которой Денисов, ничего не упоминая о винах провиантского ведомства, просил только о помиловании.","""It's clear you can't beat a butt with a whip,"" he said, moving away from the window and handing Rostov a large envelope. - It was a request addressed to the sovereign, drawn up by an auditor, in which Denisov, without mentioning anything about the faults of the provisions department, asked only for pardon.","“It seems you can't bghreak an axhead with a stghraw,” he said, coming from the window and handing Rostov a large envelope.

"— Ну, вот ты хочешь освободить крестьян, — продолжал он. — Это очень хорошо; но не для тебя (ты, я думаю, никого не засекал и не посылал в Сибирь), и еще меньше для крестьян. Ежели их бьют, секут, посылают в Сибирь, то я думаю, что им от этого нисколько не хуже. В Сибири ведет он ту же свою скотскую жизнь, а рубцы на теле заживут, и он так же счастлив, как и был прежде. А нужно это для тех людей, которые гибнут нравственно, наживают себе раскаяние, подавляют это раскаяние и грубеют от того, что у них есть возможность казнить право и неправо. Вот кого мне жалко, и для кого бы я желал освободить крестьян. Ты, может быть, не видал, а я видел, как хорошие люди, воспитанные в этих преданиях неограниченной власти, с годами, когда они делаются раздражительнее, делаются жестоки, грубы, знают это, не могут удержаться и всё делаются несчастнее и несчастнее. — Князь Андрей говорил это с таким увлечением, что Пьер невольно подумал о том, что мысли эти наведены были Андрею его отцом. Он ничего не отвечал ему.","“Well, you want to free the peasants,” he continued. - It is very good; but not for you (I think you didn't spot anyone or send them to Siberia), and even less so for the peasants. If they are beaten, flogged, sent to Siberia, then I think that this does not make them any worse. In Siberia, he leads the same bestial life, and the scars on his body will heal, and he is as happy as he was before. And this is necessary for those people who perish morally, earn themselves repentance, suppress this repentance and become rude because they have the opportunity to execute right and wrong. That's who I feel sorry for, and for whom I would like to free the peasants. You may not have seen, but I have seen how good people, brought up in these traditions of unlimited power, become more irritable as the years go by, become cruel, rude, they know it, they cannot restrain themselves, and everything becomes more and more unhappy. - Prince Andrei said this with such enthusiasm that Pierre involuntarily thought that these thoughts were induced by Andrei by his father. He didn't answer him.","“Well, here you want to emancipate the peasants,” he went on. “That's very good; but not for you (I suppose you've never whipped anyone to death or sent them to Siberia), and still less for the peasants. If they're beaten, whipped, and sent to Siberia, I don't think that makes it any worse for them. In Siberia he'll go on with his brutish life, and the welts on his body will heal, and he'll be as happy as he was before. But it's needed for those people who are morally ruined, live to repent it, suppress this repentance, and turn coarse, because they have the possibility of punishing justly and unjustly. Those are the ones I pity and for whose sake I would wish for the emancipation of the peasants. Maybe you haven't seen it, but I've seen good people brought up in this tradition of unlimited power, as they become more irritated over the years, become cruel, coarse, know it, can't help themselves, and become more and more unhappy.” Prince Andrei said this with such enthusiasm that it involuntarily occurred to Pierre that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrei by his father. He made no reply.","‘There now, you wish to liberate your serfs,’ he continued, ‘that is a very good thing, but not for you— I don’t suppose you ever had anyone flogged or sent to Siberia—and still less for your serfs. If they are beaten, flogged, or sent to Siberia, I don’t suppose they are any the worse off. In Siberia they lead the same animal life, and the stripes on their bodies heal, and they are happy as before. But it is a good thing for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon themselves, stifle this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly. It is those people I pity, and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs. You may not have seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those traditions of unlimited power, in time when they grow more irritable, become cruel and harsh, are conscious of it, but cannot restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable.’ Prince Andrei spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrei by his father’s case. He did not reply."

"В чаду своих занятий и увлечений Пьер однако, по прошествии года, начал чувствовать, как та почва масонства, на которой он стоял, тем более уходила из-под его ног, чем тверже он старался стать на ней. Вместе с тем он чувствовал, что чем глубже уходила под его ногами почва, на которой он стоял, тем невольнее он был связан с ней. Когда он приступил к масонству, он испытывал чувство человека, доверчиво становящего ногу на ровную поверхность болота. Поставив ногу, он провалился. Чтобы вполне увериться в твердости почвы, на которой он стоял, он поставил другую ногу и провалился еще больше, завяз и уже невольно ходил по колено в болоте.","In the midst of his studies and hobbies, Pierre, however, after a year, began to feel how the soil of Freemasonry on which he stood, the more he left from under his feet, the harder he tried to become on it. At the same time, he felt that the deeper the soil on which he stood went under his feet, the more involuntarily he was connected with it. When he began Freemasonry, he experienced the feeling of a man trustingly placing his foot on the flat surface of a swamp. Putting his foot down, he fell. In order to fully assure himself of the firmness of the ground on which he stood, he put his other foot on and sank even more, got stuck and already involuntarily walked knee-deep in the swamp.","In the daze of his activities and diversions, however, Pierre began to feel after a year that the ground of Masonry, on which he stood, was giving way all the more under his feet the more firmly he tried to stand on it. Along with that, he felt that the further the ground he stood on gave way under his feet, the more involuntarily he was bound to it. When he was starting out in Masonry, he experienced the feeling of a man who trustingly sets foot on the smooth surface of a swamp. Placing one foot on it, he sank. To verify fully the firmness of the ground on which he stood, he placed the other foot on it and sank still more, became stuck, and now involuntarily walked knee-deep through the swamp.","Amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest upon it, the more the masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him. At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the Order. When he had joined the Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently steps onto the smooth surface of a bog. When he put his foot down it sank in. To make quite sure of the firmness of the ground, he put his other foot down and sank deeper still, became stuck in it, and involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog."
"Илья Андреич придумал эту дипломатическую хитрость для того, чтобы дать простор будущей золовке объясниться с своей невесткой (как он сказал это после дочери) и еще для того, чтобы избежать возможности встречи с князем, которого он боялся.

"Этот первый, длинный разговор с Сперанским только усилил в князе Андрее то чувство, с которым он в первый раз увидал Сперанского. Он видел в нем разумного, строго-мыслящего, огромного ума человека, энергией и упорством достигшего власти и употребляющего ее только для блага России. Сперанский в глазах князя Андрея был именно тот человек, разумно объясняющий все явления жизни, признающий действительным только то, что разумно, и ко всему умеющий прилагать мерило разумности, которым он сам так хотел быть. Всё представлялось так просто, ясно в изложении Сперанского, что князь Андрей невольно соглашался с ним во всем. Ежели он возражал и спорил, то только потому, что хотел нарочно быть самостоятельным и не совсем подчиняться мнениям Сперанского. Всё было так, всё было хорошо, но одно смущало князя Андрея: это был холодный, зеркальный, не пропускающий к себе в душу взгляд Сперанского, и его белая, нежная рука, на которую невольно смотрел князь Андрей, как смотрят обыкновенно на руки людей, имеющих власть. Зеркальный взгляд и нежная рука эта почему-то раздражали князя Андрея. Неприятно поражало князя Андрея еще слишком большое презрение к людям, которое он замечал в Сперанском, и разнообразность приемов в доказательствах, которые он приводил в подтверждение своих мнений. Он употреблял все возможные орудия мысли, исключая сравнения, и слишком смело, как казалось князю Андрею, переходил от одного к другому. То он становился на почву практического деятеля и осуждал мечтателей, то на почву сатирика и иронически подсмеивался над противниками, то становился строго логичным, то вдруг поднимался в область метафизики. (Это последнее орудие доказательств он особенно часто употреблял.) Он переносил вопрос на метафизические высоты, переходил в определения пространства, времени, мысли и, вынося оттуда опровержения, опять спускался на почву спора.","This first, long conversation with Speransky only strengthened in Prince Andrei the feeling with which he saw Speransky for the first time. He saw in him a reasonable, strict-thinking, huge mind of a man who had achieved power with energy and perseverance and was using it only for the good of Russia. Speransky, in the eyes of Prince Andrei, was precisely that person who rationally explains all the phenomena of life, recognizes as valid only that which is reasonable, and knows how to apply the measure of rationality to everything, which he himself so wanted to be. Everything seemed so simple, clear in Speransky's presentation that Prince Andrei involuntarily agreed with him in everything. If he objected and argued, it was only because he wanted to be independent on purpose and not completely obey the opinions of Speransky. Everything was like this, everything was fine, but one thing confused Prince Andrei: it was Speransky’s cold, mirror-like look, not letting in his soul, and his white, tender hand, which Prince Andrei involuntarily looked at, as they usually look at people’s hands, having power. For some reason, this mirror look and this gentle hand irritated Prince Andrei. Unpleasantly, Prince Andrei was also struck by the too great contempt for people that he noticed in Speransky, and the variety of methods in the evidence that he cited in support of his opinions. He used all possible tools of thought, excluding comparisons, and too boldly, as it seemed to Prince Andrei, he moved from one to another. Now he took to the ground of a practical figure and condemned the dreamers, then to the ground of a satirist and ironically laughed at his opponents, then he became strictly logical, then he suddenly rose into the realm of metaphysics. (He used this last instrument of proof with particular frequency.) He carried the question to metaphysical heights, passed into the definitions of space, time, thought, and, bringing refutations from there, again descended to the ground of the dispute.","This first long conversation with Speransky only strengthened in Prince Andrei the feeling he had had on first seeing him. He saw in him a reasonable, rigorous-minded man of immense intelligence, who through his energy and perseverance had come to power and used it solely for the good of Russia. Speransky, in Prince Andrei's eyes, was precisely that man—explaining all phenomena of life reasonably, accepting as real only that which is reasonable, and capable of applying the standard of reasonableness to everything—whom he himself wanted so much to be. Everything seemed so simple, so clear in Speransky's explanations that Prince Andrei involuntarily agreed with him in everything. If he protested and argued, it was only because he purposely wanted to be independent and not to yield entirely to Speransky's opinions. Everything was right, everything was very well, but one thing disconcerted Prince Andrei: it was Speransky's cold, mirror-like gaze, which let no one penetrate to his soul, and his tender white hand, at which Prince Andrei stared involuntarily, as one stares at the hands of people who have power. The mirrorlike gaze and that tender white hand for some reason irritated Prince Andrei. He was also unpleasantly struck by a too-great contempt for people that he noticed in Speransky, and the diversity of methods of proof he resorted to in confirming his opinions. He employed every possible intellectual tool, except for analogy, and seemed to pass too boldly from one to another. Now he would stand on the practical activist's ground and denounce dreamers, now on the satirist's ground and chuckle ironically at his adversaries; now he would become strictly logical, now he would suddenly rise into the spheres of metaphysics. (This last instrument of proof he made use of especially often.) He would transfer the question to metaphysical heights, go on to definitions of space, time, thought, and, deriving his refutations from there, descend again to the ground of the argument.","This first long conversation with Speransky only strengthened in Prince Andrei the feeling he had experienced towards him at their first meeting. He saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking man of vast intellect who by his energy and persistence had attained power, which he was using solely for the welfare of Russia.

Everything seemed so simple and clear in Speransky’s exposition that Prince Andrei involuntarily agreed with him about everything. If he replied and argued, it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and not submit to Speransky’s opinions entirely. Everything was right and everything was as it should be: only one thing disconcerted Prince Andrei. This was Speransky’s cold, mirror-like look, which did not allow one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white hands, which Prince Andrei involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those who possess power. This mirror-like gaze and those delicate hands irritated Prince Andrei, he knew not why. He was unpleasantly struck, too, by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in Speransky, and by the diversity of lines of argument he used to support his opinions. He made use of every kind of mental device, except analogy, and passed too boldly, it seemed to Prince Andrei, from one to another. Now he would take up the position of a practical man and condemn dreamers; now that of a satirist, and laugh ironically at his opponents; now grow severely logical, or suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics. (This last resource was one he very frequently employed.) He would transfer a question to metaphysical heights, pass on to definitions of space, time, and thought, and having deduced the refutation he needed, would again descend to the level of the original discussion."

"Отец с матерью больше не говорили об этом деле с сыном; но несколько дней после этого, графиня позвала к себе Соню и с жестокостью, которой не ожидали ни та, ни другая, графиня упрекала племянницу в заманивании сына и в неблагодарности. Соня, молча с опущенными глазами, слушала жестокие слова графини и не понимала, чего от нее требуют. Она всем готова была пожертвовать для своих благодетелей. Мысль о самопожертвовании была любимой ее мыслью; но в этом случае она не могла понять, кому и чем ей надо жертвовать. Она не могла не любить графиню и всю семью Ростовых, но и не могла не любить Николая и не знать, что его счастие зависело от этой любви. Она была молчалива и грустна, и не отвечала. Николай не мог, как ему казалось, перенести долее этого положения и пошел объясниться с матерью. Николай то умолял мать простить его и Соню и согласиться на их брак, то угрожал матери тем, что, ежели Соню будут преследовать, то он сейчас же женится на ней тайно.","The father and mother no longer talked about this matter with their son; but a few days after that, the countess called Sonya to her, and with cruelty, which neither one nor the other expected, the countess reproached her niece for luring her son and for ingratitude. Sonya, silently with lowered eyes, listened to the cruel words of the countess and did not understand what was required of her. She was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors. The thought of self-sacrifice was her favorite thought; but in this case, she could not understand to whom and what she should sacrifice. She could not help but love the countess and the entire Rostov family, but she could not help but love Nikolai and not know that his happiness depended on this love. She was silent and sad, and did not answer. Nikolai could not, as it seemed to him, endure this situation any longer and went to explain himself to his mother. Nicholas then begged his mother to forgive him and Sonya and agree to their marriage, then threatened his mother that, if Sonya was persecuted, he would immediately marry her secretly.","The father and mother spoke no further with their son about this matter; but several days later the countess summoned Sonya to her and, with a cruelty neither of them expected, reproached her niece for luring her son away and for ingratitude.

"Говоря это, он не спускал улыбающихся глаз с лица, с шеи, с оголенных рук Наташи. Наташа несомненно знала, что он восхищается ею. Ей было это приятно, но почему-то ей тесно и тяжело становилось от его присутствия. Когда она не смотрела на него, она чувствовала, что он смотрел на ее плечи, и она невольно перехватывала его взгляд, чтоб он уж лучше смотрел на ее глаза. Но, глядя ему в глаза, она со страхом чувствовала, что между им и ей совсем нет той преграды стыдливости, которую она всегда чувствовала между собой и другими мужчинами. Она, сама не зная как, через пять минут чувствовала себя страшно-близкой к этому человеку. Когда она отворачивалась, она боялась, как бы он сзади не взял ее за голую руку, не поцеловал бы ее в шею. Они говорили о самых простых вещах и она чувствовала, что они близки, как она никогда не была с мужчиной. Наташа оглядывалась на Элен и на отца, как будто спрашивая их, что такое это значило; но Элен была занята разговором с каким-то генералом и не ответила на ее взгляд, а взгляд отца ничего не сказал ей, как только то, что он всегда говорил: «весело, ну я и рад».","Saying this, he did not take his smiling eyes off his face, from his neck, from Natasha's bare hands. Natasha undoubtedly knew that he admired her. It was pleasant for her, but for some reason it became cramped and hard for her from his presence. When she did not look at him, she felt that he was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily intercepted his gaze so that he would better look into her eyes. But, looking into his eyes, she felt with fear that between him and her there was not at all that barrier of shame that she had always felt between herself and other men. She herself, not knowing how, in five minutes felt terribly close to this man. When she turned away, she was afraid that he would take her bare hand from behind, kiss her on the neck. They talked about the simplest things and she felt that they were close, like she had never been with a man. Natasha looked back at Helen and at her father, as if asking them what it meant; but Helen was busy talking to some general and did not return her glance, and her father's glance told her nothing, only that he always said: ""fun, well, I'm glad.""","While saying this, he never took his smiling eyes from Natasha's face, neck, and bared arms. Natasha knew beyond doubt that he admired her. She enjoyed that, but for some reason his presence made her feel constrained, hot, and oppressed.

But, looking into his eyes, she felt with fear that between him and her that barrier of modesty which she had always felt between herself and other men was not there at all. Without knowing how herself, after five minutes she felt terribly close to this man. Whenever she turned away, she was afraid he might take her bare arm from behind or kiss her on the neck. They talked about the simplest things, and she felt that they were closer than she had ever been with any man. Natasha glanced at Hélène and at her father, as if asking them what on earth it meant, but Hélène was taken up by a conversation with some general and did not respond to her glance, and her father's glance said nothing to her except what it always said: “You're enjoying yourself, and I'm glad.”","While saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face, her neck, and her bare arms. Natasha knew for certain that he was enraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel constrained and oppressed.

But looking into his eyes she was frightened, realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other men. She did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to this man.

Well, I’m glad of it!’"

"Несмотря на то, что Николай Ростов, твердо держась своего намерения, продолжал темно служить в глухом полку, расходуя сравнительно мало денег, ход жизни в Отрадном был таков, и в особенности Митенька так вел дела, что долги неудержимо росли с каждым годом.

"Сейчас только приехал от благодетеля, и спешу записать всё, что я испытал при этом. Иосиф Алексеевич живет бедно и страдает третий год мучительною болезнью пузыря. Никто никогда не слыхал от него стона, или слова ропота. С утра и до поздней ночи, за исключением часов, в которые он кушает самую простую пищу, он работает над наукой. Он принял меня милостиво и посадил на кровати, на которой он лежал; я сделал ему знак рыцарей Востока и Иерусалима, он ответил мне тем же, и с кроткой улыбкой спросил меня о том, что я узнал и приобрел в прусских и шотландских ложах. Я рассказал ему всё, как умел, передав те основания, которые я предлагал в нашей петербургской ложе и сообщил о дурном приеме, сделанном мне, и о разрыве, происшедшем между мною и братьями. Иосиф Алексеевич, изрядно помолчав и подумав, на всё это изложил мне свой взгляд, который мгновенно осветил мне всё прошедшее и весь будущий путь, предлежащий мне. Он удивил меня, спросив о том, помню ли я, в чем состоит троякая цель ордена: 1) в хранении и познании таинства; 2) в очищении и исправлении себя для воспринятия оного и 3) в исправлении рода человеческого чрез стремление к таковому очищению. Какая есть главнейшая и первая цель из этих трех? Конечно собственное исправление и очищение. Только к этой цели мы можем всегда стремиться независимо от всех обстоятельств. Но вместе с тем эта-то цель и требует от нас наиболее трудов, и потому, заблуждаясь гордостью, мы, упуская эту цель, беремся либо за таинство, которое недостойны воспринять по нечистоте своей, либо беремся за исправление рода человеческого, когда сами из себя являем пример мерзости и разврата. Иллюминатство не есть чистое учение именно потому, что оно увлеклось общественной деятельностью и преисполнено гордости. На этом основании Иосиф Алексеевич осудил мою речь и всю мою деятельность. Я согласился с ним в глубине души своей. По случаю разговора нашего о моих семейных делах, он сказал мне: — Главная обязанность истинного масона, как я сказал вам, состоит в совершенствовании самого себя. Но часто мы думаем, что, удалив от себя все трудности нашей жизни, мы скорее достигнем этой цели; напротив, государь мой, сказал он мне, только в среде светских волнений можем мы достигнуть трех главных целей: 1) самопознания, ибо человек может познавать себя только через сравнение, 2) совершенствования, только борьбой достигается оно, и 3) достигнуть главной добродетели — любви к смерти. Только превратности жизни могут показать нам тщету ее и могут содействовать — нашей врожденной любви к смерти или возрождению к новой жизни. Слова эти тем более замечательны, что Иосиф Алексеевич, несмотря на свои тяжкие физические страдания, никогда не тяготится жизнию, а любит смерть, к которой он, несмотря на всю чистоту и высоту своего внутреннего человека, не чувствует еще себя достаточно готовым. Потом благодетель объяснил мне вполне значение великого квадрата мироздания и указал на то, что тройственное и седьмое число суть основание всего. Он советовал мне не отстраняться от общения с петербургскими братьями и, занимая в ложе только должности 2-го градуса, стараться, отвлекая братьев от увлечений гордости, обращать их на истинный путь самопознания и совершенствования. Кроме того для себя лично советовал мне первее всего следить за самим собою, и с этою целью дал мне тетрадь, ту самую, в которой я пишу и буду вписывать впредь все свои поступки».","I have just arrived from a benefactor, and I hasten to write down everything that I experienced at the same time. Iosif Alekseevich lives in poverty and suffers for the third year from a painful bladder disease. No one ever heard from him a groan, or a word of grumbling. From morning until late at night, with the exception of the hours in which he eats the simplest food, he works on science. He received me graciously and sat me down on the bed on which he was lying; I made him the sign of the knights of the East and Jerusalem, he answered me the same, and with a meek smile asked me about what I had learned and acquired in the Prussian and Scottish lodges. I told him everything as well as I could, conveying the grounds that I offered in our St. Petersburg box and reported on the bad reception that had been given to me, and about the rupture that had occurred between me and the brothers. Iosif Alekseevich, after a considerable pause and thought, presented to me his view of all this, which instantly illuminated for me everything that had passed and the whole future path that lay before me. He surprised me by asking me if I remember what the threefold purpose of the order is: 1) to keep and know the sacrament; 2) in the purification and correction of oneself for the perception of it, and 3) in the correction of the human race through the desire for such purification. What is the main and first goal of these three? Certainly own correction and purification. Only towards this goal can we always strive, regardless of all circumstances. But at the same time, it is this goal that requires the most labor from us, and therefore, deluded by pride, we, missing this goal, either take on the sacrament that we are unworthy to receive because of our impurity, or take on the correction of the human race, when we ourselves We are an example of abomination and depravity. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine precisely because it is carried away by social activities and is full of pride. On this basis, Iosif Alekseevich condemned my speech and all my activities. I agreed with him in the depths of my soul. On the occasion of our conversation about my family affairs, he said to me: - The main duty of a true Mason, as I told you, is to perfect himself. But often we think that by removing all the difficulties of our life from ourselves, we will more quickly achieve this goal; on the contrary, my lord, he told me, only in the midst of secular unrest can we achieve three main goals: 1) self-knowledge, for a person can know himself only through comparison, 2) perfection, only by struggle is it achieved, and 3) achieve the main virtue - love for death. Only the vicissitudes of life can show us the futility of it and can contribute to our innate love for death or rebirth into a new life. These words are all the more remarkable because Iosif Alekseevich, despite his severe physical suffering, is never burdened by life, but loves death, for which, despite all the purity and loftiness of his inner man, he still does not feel himself sufficiently prepared. Then the benefactor fully explained to me the meaning of the great square of the universe and pointed out that the triple and the seventh number are the foundation of everything. He advised me not to distance myself from communication with the St. Petersburg brothers and, occupying only positions of the 2nd degree in the box, to try, distracting the brothers from the hobbies of pride, to turn them to the true path of self-knowledge and improvement. In addition, for himself personally, he advised me first of all to take care of myself, and for this purpose he gave me a notebook, the same one in which I write and will continue to enter all my actions.","Just back from my benefactor and hasten to write down everything I experienced. Iosif Alexeevich lives in poverty and has been suffering for three years from a painful bladder ailment. No one has ever heard a groan or a word of protest from him. From morning till late at night, except for the times when he eats the plainest food, he works at science.

He surprised me, asking whether I remembered the triple goal of the order: (1) keeping and knowing the mystery; (2) purifying and correcting oneself for the receiving of it; and (3) correcting the human race through striving for this purification. Which is the chiefest and first goal of the three? Of course, the purifying and correcting of oneself. It is the only goal we can strive for regardless of all circumstances. But at the same time, this goal precisely calls for our greatest effort, and therefore, deluded by pride, we neglect this goal and pursue either the mystery, which we are unworthy to partake of because of our impurity, or the correction of the human race, while we ourselves are an example of vileness and depravity. Illuminism is not a pure teaching precisely because it became concerned with social activity and is all filled with pride. On that basis, Iosif Alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity. I agreed with him in the depths of my soul. As our conversation turned to my family affairs, he told me: “The main duty of a true Mason, as I've told you, consists in perfecting one's own self. But we often think that, by removing all difficulties from our life, we will the sooner reach this goal. On the contrary, my dear sir,” he said to me, “only amidst the world's troubles can we achieve the three main goals: (1) self-knowledge—for man can only know himself through comparison; (2) perfection—for it is achieved only through struggle; and (3) achieving the main virtue—the love of death. Only life's adversities can show us its vanity and contribute to our innate love of death, or rebirth into a new life.” These words are the more remarkable in that Iosif Alexeevich, despite his great physical suffering, is never burdened by life, but loves death, for which, despite all the purity and loftiness of his inner man, he still does not feel himself sufficiently prepared. Then my benefactor fully explained to me the meaning of the great square of creation, and pointed out that the numbers three and seven are the foundation of everything. He advised me not to shun the company of the Petersburg brothers and, occupying only positions of the second degree in the lodge, to try, while keeping the brothers from the passions of pride, to turn them to the true path of self-knowledge and perfection. Besides that, for me personally, he advised first of all that I keep watch over myself, and with that purpose he gave me a notebook, the one in which I am writing and will henceforth write down all my acts.","I have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I have experienced. Iosif Alexeevich is living poorly and has for three years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint. From morning till late at night, except when he eats his very plain food, he is working at science. He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on which he lay. I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of Jerusalem, and he responded in the same manner, asking me with a mild smile what I had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish Lodges. I told him everything as best I could, and told him what I had proposed to our Petersburg Lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, and of my rupture with the Brothers. Iosif Alexeevich, having remained silent and thoughtful for a good while, told me his view of the matter, which at once lit up for me my whole past, and the future path I should follow. He surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of the Order: (1) The preservation and study of the mystery, (2) The purification and reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The improvement of the human race by striving for such purification. Which is the principal aim of these three? Certainly self-reformation and self-purification. Only to this aim can we always strive independently of circumstances. But at the same time, just this aim demands the greatest efforts of us; and so, led astray by pride, losing sight of this aim, we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our impurity we are unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation of the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and profligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine just because it is attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground Iosif Alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the depth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs he said to me, ‘the chief duty of a true mason, as I have told you, lies in perfecting himself. We often think that by removing all the difficulties of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim, but on the contrary, my dear sir, it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain our three chief aims: (1) Self-knowledge—for man can only know himself by comparison, (2) Self-perfecting, which can only be attained by conflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief virtue—love of death. Only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity, and develop our innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life.’ These words are all the more remarkable because, in spite of his great physical sufferings, Iosif Alexeevich is never weary of life though he loves death, for which—in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man—he does not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared. My benefactor then explained to me fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation, and pointed out to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything. He advised me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but to take up only second-grade posts in the Lodge, to try, while diverting the Brothers from pride, to turn them towards the true path of self-knowledge and self-perfecting. Besides this he advised me for myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself, and to that end he gave me a notebook, the one I am now writing in, and in which I will in future note down all my actions."
"— Я? — сказал Николай вспоминая; — вот видишь ли, сначала я думал, что Ругай, красный кобель, похож на дядюшку и что ежели бы он был человек, то он дядюшку всё бы еще держал у себя, ежели не за скачку, так за лады, всё бы держал.

How good he is, uncle! Is not it? - Well, what about you?","“Me?” said Nikolai, trying to recall. “You see, first I was thinking that Rugai, the red dog, resembles uncle, and that if he were a man, he would always keep uncle with him, if not for the chase, then for his tunefulness.

Well, and you?”","said Nikolai, trying to remember. ‘Well, you see, first I thought that Rugay, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were a man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding then for his manner.

В парных санях, на двух серых рысаках, закидывающих снегом головашки саней, промелькнул Анатоль с своим всегдашним товарищем Макариным. Анатоль сидел прямо, в классической позе военных щеголей, закутав низ лица бобровым воротником и немного пригнув голову.

"Иосифа Алексеевича не было в Петербурге. (Он в последнее время отстранился от дел петербургских лож и безвыездно жил в Москве.) Все братья, члены лож, были Пьеру знакомые в жизни люди и ему трудно было видеть в них только братьев по каменьщичеству, а не князя Б., не Ивана Васильевича Д., которых он знал в жизни большею частию как слабых и ничтожных людей. Из-под масонских фартуков и знаков он видел на них мундиры и кресты, которых они добивались в жизни. Часто, собирая милостыню и сочтя 20–30 рублей, записанных на приход, и большею частию в долг с десяти членов, из которых половина были так же богаты, как и он, Пьер вспоминал масонскую клятву о том, что каждый брат обещает отдать всё свое имущество для ближнего; и в душе его поднимались сомнения, на которых он старался не останавливаться.","Iosif Alekseevich was not in Petersburg. (He has recently retired from the affairs of St. Petersburg lodges and lived without a break in Moscow.) All the brothers, members of the lodges, were people familiar to Pierre in life, and it was difficult for him to see in them only brothers in stoneworking, and not Prince B., not Ivan Vasilyevich D., whom he knew in life for the most part as weak and insignificant people. From under the Masonic aprons and signs, he saw on them uniforms and crosses, which they had achieved in life. Often, collecting alms and counting 20-30 rubles written down for the parish, and mostly in debt from ten members, of whom half were as rich as he was, Pierre recalled the Masonic oath that each brother promises to give all his property for a neighbor; and doubts arose in his soul, on which he tried not to dwell.","Iosif Alexeevich was not in Petersburg.

Разговор естественно зашел о мире. Офицеры, товарищи Ростова, как и большая часть армии, были недовольны миром, заключенным после Фридланда. Говорили, что еще бы подержаться, Наполеон бы пропал, что у него в войсках ни сухарей, ни зарядов уж не было. Николай молча ел и преимущественно пил. Он выпил один две бутылки вина.

Причины, на которых герцог Бассано основывал свой отказ выдать сии паспорты, никогда не могли бы заставить меня предполагать, чтобы поступок моего посла послужил поводом к нападению. И в действительности он не имел на то от меня повеления, как было объявлено им самим; и как только я узнал о сем, то немедленно выразил мое неудовольствие князю Куракину, повелев ему исполнять по-прежнему порученные ему обязанности. Ежели Ваше Величество не расположены проливать кровь наших подданных из-за подобного недоразумения и ежели Вы согласны вывести свои войска из русских владений, то я оставлю без внимания все происшедшее, и соглашение между нами будет возможно.

The reasons on which the Duke of Bassano based his refusal to issue these passports could never have led me to suppose that my ambassador's act was a pretext for an attack. And in fact he had no order from me to do so, as he himself announced; and as soon as I found out about this, I immediately expressed my displeasure to Prince Kurakin, ordering him to fulfill the duties still entrusted to him. If Your Majesty is not disposed to shed the blood of our subjects because of such a misunderstanding, and if you agree to withdraw your troops from the Russian possessions, then I will ignore everything that has happened, and an agreement between us will be possible.

"Князь Андрей поздно вечером уехал от Ростовых. Он лег спать по привычке ложиться, но увидал скоро, что он не может спать. Он то, зажжа свечку, сидел в постели, то вставал, то опять ложился, нисколько не тяготясь бессонницей: так радостно и ново ему было на душе, как будто он из душной комнаты вышел на вольный свет Божий. Ему и в голову не приходило, чтобы он был влюблен в Ростову; он не думал о ней; он только воображал ее себе, и вследствие этого вся жизнь его представлялась ему в новом свете. «Из чего я бьюсь, из чего я хлопочу в этой узкой, замкнутой рамке, когда жизнь, вся жизнь со всеми ее радостями открыта мне?» говорил он себе. И он в первый раз после долгого времени стал делать счастливые планы на будущее. Он решил сам собою, что ему надо заняться воспитанием своего сына, найдя ему воспитателя и поручив ему; потом надо выйти в отставку и ехать за границу, видеть Англию, Швейцарию, Италию. «Мне надо пользоваться своей свободой, пока так много в себе чувствую силы и молодости, говорил он сам себе.

"Граф Илья Андреич вышел из предводителей, потому что эта должность была сопряжена с слишком большими расходами. Но дела его всё не поправлялись. Часто Наташа и Николай видели тайные, беспокойные переговоры родителей и слышали толки о продаже богатого, родового Ростовского дома и подмосковной. Без предводительства не нужно было иметь такого большого приема, и отрадненская жизнь велась тише, чем в прежние годы; но огромный дом и флигеля всё-таки были полны народом, за стол всё так же садилось больше человек. Всё это были свои, обжившиеся в доме люди, почти члены семейства или такие, которые, казалось, необходимо должны были жить в доме графа. Таковы были Диммлер — музыкант с женой, Иогель — танцовальный учитель с семейством, старушка-барышня Белова, жившая в доме, и еще многие другие: учителя Пети, бывшая гувернантка барышень и просто люди, которым лучше или выгоднее было жить у графа, чем дома. Не было такого большого приезда как прежде, но ход жизни велся тот же, без которого не могли граф с графиней представить себе жизни. Та же была, еще увеличенная Николаем, охота, те же 50 лошадей и 15 кучеров на конюшне, те же дорогие подарки в именины, и торжественные на весь уезд обеды; те же графские висты и бостоны, за которыми он, распуская всем на вид карты, давал себя каждый день на сотни обыгрывать соседям, смотревшим на право составлять партию графа Ильи Андреича, как на самую выгодную аренду.","Count Ilya Andreich resigned from the leadership because this post was too expensive. But things didn't get better for him. Often Natasha and Nikolai saw the secret, restless negotiations of their parents and heard rumors about the sale of a rich, ancestral Rostov house and a suburban one. Without leadership, it was not necessary to have such a large reception, and Otradnenskaya life was conducted more quietly than in previous years; but the huge house and outbuilding were still full of people, more people were still sitting at the table. All these were people who had settled down in the house, almost members of the family, or those who, it seemed, had to live in the count's house. These were Dimmler - a musician with his wife, Yogel - a dance teacher with his family, the old lady Belova, who lived in the house, and many others: Petya's teachers, the former governess of the young ladies and just people who were better or more profitable to live with the count than at home . There was no such big visit as before, but the course of life was the same, without which the count and countess could not imagine life. There was the same, still increased by Nikolai, hunting, the same 50 horses and 15 coachmen at the stable, the same expensive gifts on name days, and solemn dinners for the whole county; the same count whists and bostons, behind which he, dissolving cards for everyone to see, allowed himself to be beaten every day by hundreds of neighbors who looked at the right to play the game of Count Ilya Andreich as the most profitable lease.","Count Ilya Andreich resigned as marshal of the nobility because the post entailed very great expenses. But his affairs did not improve. Often Natasha and Nikolai saw secret, worried conversations between their parents and heard talk of selling the Rostovs' magnificent ancestral house and the estate near Moscow. Without the marshalship, he did not have to have such large receptions, and life in Otradnoe took a quieter course than in former years; but still, the huge house and wing were full of people, and, as before, more than twenty sat down at table. These were all people who had been accustomed to the house, almost members of the family, or such as, it seemed, had necessarily to live in the count's house. These were the musician Dimmler[159] and his wife, the dancing master Iogel and his family, the old maiden lady Belov, who lived in the house, and many others as well: Petya's teachers, the girls' former governess, and simply people who for some reason found it better or more advantageous to live in the count's house than in their own. There were not such big receptions as before, but they maintained the same way of life, for without it the count and countess could not imagine life at all. There was the same hunt, increased still more by Nikolai, the same fifty horses and fifteen coachmen in the stable; the same expensive presents to each other on name days and festive dinners for the whole district; the same whists and Bostons, during which the count, holding his cards fanlike for everyone to see, allowed himself to lose hundreds daily to his neighbors, who looked upon their right to play cards with Count Ilya Andreich as upon a most profitable source of income.","COUNT Ilya Andreich Rostov had resigned the position of Marshal of the Nobility because it involved him in too much expense, but still his affairs did not improve. Natasha and Nikolai often noticed their parents conferring together anxiously and privately, and heard suggestions of selling the fine ancestral house and estate near Moscow. It was not necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been Marshal, and life at Otradnoe was quieter than in former years, but still the enormous house and its lodges were full of people, and more than twenty sat down to table every day. These were all their own people who had settled down in the house almost as members of the family, or persons who were, it seemed, obliged to live in the count’s house. Such were Dimmler the musician and his wife, Vogel the dancing-master and his family, Belova, an old maiden lady, an inmate of the house, and many others such as Petya’s tutors, the girls’ former governess, and other people who simply found it preferable and more advantageous to live in the count’s house than at home. They had not as many visitors as before, but the old habits of life, without which the count and countess could not conceive of existence, remained unchanged. There was still the hunting establishment which Nikolai had even enlarged, the same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables, the same expensive presents and dinner-parties to the whole district on name-days; there were still the count’s games of whist and boston, at which—spreading out his cards so that everyone could see them —he let himself be plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by neighbours, who looked upon an opportunity to play a rubber with Count Ilya Andreich as a most profitable source of income."

"Но через две недели после его отъезда, она так же неожиданно для окружающих ее, очнулась от своей нравственной болезни, стала такая же как прежде, но только с измененной нравственной физиогномией, как дети с другим лицом встают с постели после продолжительной болезни.","But two weeks after his departure, just as unexpectedly for those around her, she woke up from her moral illness, became the same as before, but only with a changed moral physiognomy, like children with a different face get out of bed after a long illness.","But two weeks after his departure, just as unexpectedly for those around her, she recovered from her moral illness and became the same as before, only with a changed moral physiognomy, as children get up with a different face after a prolonged illness.","But a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around her, she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became her old self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy, as a child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face."

"Была ростепель, грязь, холод, реки взломало, дороги сделались непроездны; по нескольку дней не выдавали ни лошадям ни людям провианта.

"В длинной комнате, ярко освещенной солнцем в большие окна, в два ряда, головами к стенам и оставляя проход по середине, лежали больные и раненые. Большая часть из них были в забытьи и не обратили вниманья на вошедших. Те, которые были в памяти, все приподнялись или подняли свои худые, желтые лица, и все с одним и тем же выражением надежды на помощь, упрека и зависти к чужому здоровью, не спуская глаз, смотрели на Ростова. Ростов вышел на середину комнаты, заглянул в соседние двери комнат с растворенными дверями, и с обеих сторон увидал то же самое. Он остановился, молча оглядываясь вокруг себя. Он никак не ожидал видеть это. Перед самым им лежал почти поперек середняго прохода, на голом полу, больной, вероятно казак, потому что волосы его были обстрижены в скобку. Казак этот лежал навзничь, раскинув огромные руки и ноги. Лицо его было багрово-красно, глаза совершенно закачены, так что видны были одни белки, и на босых ногах его и на руках, еще красных, жилы напружились как веревки. Он стукнулся затылком о пол и что-то хрипло проговорил и стал повторять это слово. Ростов прислушался к тому, что он говорил, и разобрал повторяемое им слово. Слово это было: испить — пить — испить! Ростов оглянулся, отыскивая того, кто бы мог уложить на место этого больного и дать ему воды.","In a long room, brightly lit by the sun through large windows, in two rows, with their heads to the walls and leaving a passage in the middle, lay the sick and the wounded. Most of them were in oblivion and did not pay attention to those who entered. Those that were in the memory all rose or raised their thin, yellow faces, and all with the same expression of hope for help, reproach and envy of someone else's health, without taking their eyes off Rostov. Rostov went to the middle of the room, looked into the neighboring doors of the rooms with the doors open, and saw the same thing on both sides. He stopped, silently looking around him. He never expected to see this. In front of him lay almost across the middle aisle, on the bare floor, a sick man, probably a Cossack, because his hair was cut in a bracket. This Cossack was lying on his back, his huge arms and legs spread out. His face was purple-red, his eyes were completely rolled up, so that only the whites were visible, and on his bare feet and on his hands, still red, the veins tensed like ropes. He hit the back of his head on the floor and said something hoarsely and began to repeat this word. Rostov listened to what he was saying and made out the word he repeated. The word was: drink - drink - drink! Rostov looked around, looking for someone who could put this patient in his place and give him water.","In the long room, brightly lit by the sun through the large windows, sick and wounded men lay in two rows, their heads towards the walls, leaving a passage in the middle.

"Борис в числе немногих был на Немане в день свидания императоров; он видел плоты с вензелями, проезд Наполеона по тому берегу мимо французской гвардии, видел задумчивое лицо императора Александра, в то время как он молча сидел в корчме на берегу Немана, ожидая прибытия Наполеона; видел, как оба императора сели в лодки и как Наполеон, приставши прежде к плоту, быстрыми шагами пошел вперед и, встречая Александра, подал ему руку, и как оба скрылись в павильоне. Со времени своего вступления в высшие миры, Борис сделал себе привычку внимательно наблюдать то, что происходило вокруг него и записывать. Во время свидания в Тильзите он расспрашивал об именах тех лиц, которые приехали с Наполеоном, о мундирах, которые были на них надеты, и внимательно прислушивался к словам, которые были сказаны важными лицами. В то самое время, как императоры вошли в павильон, он посмотрел на часы и не забыл посмотреть опять в то время, когда Александр вышел из павильона. Свидание продолжалось час и пятьдесят три минуты: он так и записал это в тот вечер в числе других фактов, которые, он полагал, имели историческое значение. Так как свита императора была очень небольшая, то для человека, дорожащего успехом по службе, находиться в Тильзите во время свидания императоров было делом очень важным, и Борис, попав в Тильзит, чувствовал, что с этого времени положение его совершенно утвердилось. Его не только знали, но к нему пригляделись и привыкли. Два раза он исполнял поручения к самому государю, так что государь знал его в лицо, и все приближенные не только не дичились его, как прежде, считая за новое лицо, но удивились бы, ежели бы его не было.","Boris was among the few on the Neman on the day of the meeting of the emperors; he saw rafts with monograms, Napoleon's passage along the other bank, past the French guards, he saw the pensive face of Emperor Alexander, while he silently sat in a tavern on the banks of the Neman, waiting for Napoleon's arrival; I saw how both emperors got into the boats and how Napoleon, having first landed on the raft, went forward with quick steps and, meeting Alexander, gave him his hand, and how both disappeared into the pavilion. From the time of his entry into the higher worlds, Boris made it a habit to carefully observe what was happening around him and write it down. During a meeting in Tilsit, he asked about the names of those people who came with Napoleon, about the uniforms they were wearing, and listened carefully to the words that were spoken by important people. At the same time as the emperors entered the pavilion, he looked at his watch and did not forget to look again at the time when Alexander left the pavilion. The meeting lasted an hour and fifty-three minutes: he wrote it down that evening, among other facts that, he believed, were of historical significance. Since the emperor’s retinue was very small, it was very important for a person who valued success in his service to be in Tilsit during the meeting of the emperors, and Boris, having got to Tilsit, felt that from that time on his position was completely established. He was not only known, but they got accustomed to him and got used to him. Twice he carried out assignments for the sovereign himself, so that the sovereign knew him by sight, and all those close to him not only did not shy away from him, as before, considering him a new face, but would be surprised if he were not there.","Boris was among the few who were at the Niemen on the day of the emperors' meeting; he saw the rafts with monograms and Napoleon riding along the other bank past the French guards; saw the emperor Alexander's pensive face as he sat silently in a tavern on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleon's arrival; saw how both emperors got into boats and how Napoleon, who was the first to reach the raft, stepped forward quickly to meet Alexander and gave him his hand, and how the two disappeared into the pavilion.

В стене была вделана горящая звезда; с одной стороны стола был небольшой ковер с различными изображениями, с другой было что-то в роде алтаря с Евангелием и черепом. Кругом стола было 7 больших, в роде церковных, подсвечников.

At one side of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked upon it, at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay a Testament and a skull. Round it stood seven large candlesticks like those used in churches. Two of the brothers led Pierre up to the altar, placed his feet at right angles, and bade him lie down, saying that he must prostrate himself at the Gates of the Temple."
"— Теперь я должен открыть вам главную цель нашего ордена, — сказал он, — и ежели цель эта совпадает с вашею, то вы с пользою вступите в наше братство. Первая главнейшая цель и купно основание нашего ордена, на котором он утвержден, и которого никакая сила человеческая не может низвергнуть, есть сохранение и предание потомству некоего важного таинства… от самых древнейших веков и даже от первого человека до нас дошедшего, от которого таинства, может быть, зависит судьба рода человеческого. Но так как сие таинство такого свойства, что никто не может его знать и им пользоваться, если долговременным и прилежным очищением самого себя не приуготовлен, то не всяк может надеяться скоро обрести его. Поэтому мы имеем вторую цель, которая состоит в том, чтобы приуготовлять наших членов, сколько возможно, исправлять их сердце, очищать и просвещать их разум теми средствами, которые нам преданием открыты от мужей, потрудившихся в искании сего таинства, и тем учинять их способными к восприятию оного. Очищая и исправляя наших членов, мы стараемся в-третьих исправлять и весь человеческий род, предлагая ему в членах наших пример благочестия и добродетели, и тем стараемся всеми силами противоборствовать злу, царствующему в мире. Подумайте об этом, и я опять приду к вам, — сказал он и вышел из комнаты.","“Now I must reveal to you the main goal of our order,” he said, “and if this goal coincides with yours, then you will profitably join our brotherhood. The first main goal and the foundation of our order, on which it is established, and which no human power can overthrow, is the preservation and transmission to posterity of some important sacrament ... from the most ancient centuries and even from the first person who has come down to us, from whom the sacraments can may depend on the fate of the human race. But since this mystery is of such a nature that no one can know it and use it, unless one prepares for a long-term and diligent purification of oneself, not everyone can hope to acquire it soon. Therefore, we have a second goal, which is to prepare our members, as far as possible, to correct their hearts, purify and enlighten their minds by those means that are revealed to us by tradition from men who have labored in the search for this mystery, and thereby make them capable of perception of it. Purifying and correcting our members, we try thirdly to correct the entire human race, offering it an example of piety and virtue in our members, and thereby we try with all our might to oppose the evil that reigns in the world. Think about it, and I will come to you again,” he said and left the room.","“Now I must reveal to you the main goal of our order,” he said, “and if this goal coincides with yours, it will be useful for you to enter our brotherhood.

But as it is the nature of this mystery that no one can know it and use it unless he has been prepared by long and diligent self-purification, not everyone can hope soon to attain it. Therefore we have a second goal, which consists in preparing our members as much as possible, setting their hearts to rights, purifying and enlightening their reason by means revealed to us by tradition from men who labored in search of this mystery, and thereby making them capable of apprehending it. “In purifying and setting to rights our members, we try, thirdly, to set to rights the whole human race, offering it, through our members, an example of piety and virtue, and thereby trying with all our might to oppose the evil that reigns in the world. Think it over, and I will come to you again,” he said and left the room.","‘Now I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order,’ he said, ‘and if this aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood with profit.

But since this mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by long and diligent self-purification, not everyone can hope to attain it quickly. Hence we have a secondary aim, that of preparing our members as much as possible to reform their hearts, to purify and enlighten their minds, by means handed on to us by tradition from those who have striven to attain this mystery, and thereby to render them capable of receiving it. ‘By purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, to improve the whole human race, offering it in our members an example of piety and virtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which sways the world. Think this over and I will come to you again.’"

"Отряд Платова действовал независимо от армии. Несколько раз павлоградцы были частями в перестрелках с неприятелем, захватили пленных и однажды отбили даже экипажи маршала Удино.

"Ростов заметил даже, что Денисову неприятно было, когда ему напоминали о полке и вообще о той, другой, вольной жизни, которая шла вне госпиталя. Он, казалось, старался забыть ту прежнюю жизнь и интересовался только своим делом с провиантскими чиновниками. На вопрос Ростова, в каком положении было дело, он тотчас достал из-под подушки бумагу, полученную из комиссии, и свой черновой ответ на нее. Он оживился, начав читать свою бумагу и особенно давал заметить Ростову колкости, которые он в этой бумаге говорил своим врагам. Госпитальные товарищи Денисова, окружившие было Ростова — вновь прибывшее из вольного света лицо, — стали понемногу расходиться, как только Денисов стал читать свою бумагу. По их лицам Ростов понял, что все эти господа уже не раз слышали всю эту успевшую им надоесть историю. Только сосед на кровати, толстый улан, сидел на своей койке, мрачно нахмурившись и куря трубку, и маленький Тушин без руки продолжал слушать, неодобрительно покачивая головой. В середине чтения улан перебил Денисова.","Rostov even noticed that it was unpleasant for Denisov when he was reminded of the regiment and, in general, of that other, free life that went on outside the hospital. He seemed to be trying to forget that former life and was only interested in his business with the provision officials. When asked by Rostov what the situation was, he immediately took out from under the pillow a paper received from the commission, and his rough answer to it. He perked up, starting to read his paper, and especially let Rostov notice the barbs that he spoke to his enemies in this paper. The hospital comrades of Denisov, who had surrounded Rostov - a person who had just arrived from the free world - began to disperse little by little as soon as Denisov began to read his paper. From their faces, Rostov realized that all these gentlemen had already heard this whole story that had managed to get bored of them more than once. Only the neighbor on the bed, a fat lancer, was sitting on his bunk, frowning gloomily and smoking a pipe, and little Tushin, without an arm, continued to listen, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the middle of the reading, the lancer interrupted Denisov.","Rostov even noticed that Denisov found it unpleasant to be reminded of the regiment and generally of that other, free life that went on outside the hospital.

"— Бог милостив, голубка. — Няня зажгла перед киотом обвитые золотом свечи и с чулком села у двери. Княжна Марья взяла книгу и стала читать.

Во всех концах дома было разлито и владело всеми то же чувство, которое испытывала княжна Марья, сидя в своей комнате. По поверью, что чем меньше людей знает о страданиях родильницы, тем меньше она страдает, все старались притвориться незнающими; никто не говорил об этом, но во всех людях, кроме обычной степенности и почтительности хороших манер, царствовавших в доме князя, видна была одна какая-то общая забота, смягченность сердца и сознание чего-то великого, непостижимого, совершающегося в эту минуту.","“God is merciful, dove.

Несмотря на то, что дипломаты еще твердо верили в возможность мира и усердно работали с этой целью, несмотря на то, что император Наполеон сам писал письмо императору Александру, называя его Monsieur mon frere [Государь брат мой] и искренно уверяя, что он не желает войны и что всегда будет любить и уважать его, — он ехал к армии и отдавал на каждой станции новые приказания, имевшие целью торопить движение армии от запада к востоку. Он ехал в дорожной карете, запряженной шестериком, окруженный пажами, адъютантами и конвоем, по тракту на Позен, Торн, Данциг и Кенигсберг.

The main thing he wanted to weep about was a sudden, vivid awareness of the terrible opposition between something infinitely great and indefinable that was in him, and something narrow and fleshly that he himself, and even she, was. This opposition tormented him and gladdened him while she sang.","After dinner Natasha, at Prince Andrei’s request, went to the clavichord and began singing. Prince Andrei stood by a window talking to the ladies and listened to her. In the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him, a thing he had thought impossible for him. He looked at Natasha as she sang, and something new and joyful stirred in his soul. He felt happy and at the same time sad. He had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep. What about? His former love? The little princess? His disillusionments? … His hopes for the future? … Yes and no. The chief reason was a sudden, vivid sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great and illimitable within him, and that limited and material something that he, and even she, was. This contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while she sang."
"В середине лета, княжна Марья получила неожиданное письмо от князя Андрея из Швейцарии, в котором он сообщал ей странную и неожиданную новость. Князь Андрей объявлял о своей помолвке с Ростовой. Всё письмо его дышало любовной восторженностью к своей невесте и нежной дружбой и доверием к сестре. Он писал, что никогда не любил так, как любит теперь, и что теперь только понял и узнал жизнь; он просил сестру простить его за то, что в свой приезд в Лысые Горы он ничего не сказал ей об этом решении, хотя и говорил об этом с отцом. Он не сказал ей этого потому, что княжна Марья стала бы просить отца дать свое согласие, и не достигнув бы цели, раздражила бы отца, и на себе бы понесла всю тяжесть его неудовольствия. Впрочем, писал он, тогда еще дело не было так окончательно решено, как теперь. «Тогда отец назначил мне срок, год, и вот уже шесть месяцев, половина прошло из назначенного срока, и я остаюсь более, чем когда-нибудь тверд в своем решении. Ежели бы доктора не задерживали меня здесь, на водах, я бы сам был в России, но теперь возвращение мое я должен отложить еще на три месяца. Ты знаешь меня и мои отношения с отцом. Мне ничего от него не нужно, я был и буду всегда независим, но сделать противное его воле, заслужить его гнев, когда может быть так недолго осталось ему быть с нами, разрушило бы наполовину мое счастие. Я пишу теперь ему письмо о том же и прошу тебя, выбрав добрую минуту, передать ему письмо и известить меня о том, как он смотрит на всё это и есть ли надежда на то, чтобы он согласился сократить срок на три месяца».","In the middle of summer, Princess Marya received an unexpected letter from Prince Andrei from Switzerland, in which he told her strange and unexpected news. Prince Andrei announced his engagement to Rostova. His whole letter breathed with loving enthusiasm for his bride and tender friendship and trust in his sister. He wrote that he had never loved the way he loves now, and that now he only understood and recognized life; he asked his sister to forgive him for the fact that on his visit to the Bald Mountains he had not told her anything about this decision, although he had spoken about it with his father. He did not tell her this because Princess Mary would have asked her father to give her consent, and if she had not achieved the goal, she would have irritated her father and would have carried the brunt of his displeasure. However, he wrote, at that time the matter had not yet been decided as finally as it is now. “Then my father gave me a deadline, a year, and now six months, half of the deadline has passed, and I remain more than ever firm in my decision. If the doctors had not detained me here on the waters, I would have been in Russia myself, but now I must postpone my return for another three months. You know me and my relationship with my father. I don’t need anything from him, I have always been and will always be independent, but to do something contrary to his will, to deserve his wrath, when maybe he had so little time left to be with us, would destroy half my happiness.

Столыпин заикаясь вмешался в разговор и с горячностью начал говорить о злоупотреблениях прежнего порядка вещей, угрожая придать разговору серьезный характер.

"Въехав в ворота большого дома, где было помещение ложи, и пройдя по темной лестнице, они вошли в освещенную, небольшую прихожую, где без помощи прислуги, сняли шубы.

After all, today that day is a new fashion. Yes, what do you have to do? she turned sternly to the count.","“I'm heartily glad you've come and are staying with me,” she declared. “It's none too soon,” she said, glancing significantly at Natasha ... “The old man's here, and they're expecting the son any day.

Well, we'll talk about it later,” she added, her glance at Sonya indicating that she did not want to talk about it in her presence. “Now listen,” she turned to the count, “what do you need for tomorrow? Whom will you send for? Shinshin?” she bent down one finger, “the crybaby Anna Mikhailoyna—two. She's here with her son. Getting married, the son is! Then Bezukhov, I suppose? He's here, too, with his wife. He ran away from her, but she went galloping after him. He dined with me on Wednesday. Well, and they,” she pointed to the girls, “will come with me tomorrow to the Iverskaya Chapel, and then we'll stop and see Over-Shameless.[172] I suppose you'll have to make everything new? Don't go by me, nowadays they wear sleeves like this! The other day the young princess Irina Vassilievna came to see me: a dreadful sight, as if she'd put two barrels on her arms.

As for them’—and she pointed to the girls—‘tomorrow I’ll take them first to the Iberian shrine of the Mother of God, and then we’ll drive to Aubert-Chalmé’s. * I suppose you’ll have everything new. Don’t judge by me : sleeves nowadays are this size! The other day young Princess Irina Vasilievna came to see me; she was an awful sight—looked as if she had put two barrels on her arms.

Долго после его отъезда Пьер, не ложась спать и не спрашивая лошадей, ходил по станционной комнате, обдумывая свое порочное прошедшее и с восторгом обновления представляя себе свое блаженное, безупречное и добродетельное будущее, которое казалось ему так легко. Он был, как ему казалось, порочным только потому, что он как-то случайно запамятовал, как хорошо быть добродетельным. В душе его не оставалось ни следа прежних сомнений. Он твердо верил в возможность братства людей, соединенных с целью поддерживать друг друга на пути добродетели, и таким представлялось ему масонство.","The traveler was Osip Alekseevich Bazdeev, as Pierre found out from the caretaker's book. Bazdeev was one of the most famous Freemasons and Martinists of Novik's time. Long after his departure, Pierre, without going to bed and without asking the horses, walked around the station room, pondering his vicious past and imagining his blissful, impeccable and virtuous future, which seemed so easy to him. He was, as it seemed to him, vicious only because he somehow accidentally forgot how good it is to be virtuous. Not a trace of the old doubts remained in his soul. He firmly believed in the possibility of a brotherhood of people united for the purpose of supporting each other on the path of virtue, and this was how Freemasonry seemed to him.","The traveler was Osip Alexeevich Bazdeev, as Pierre learned from the postmaster's register.

He had been depraved, it seemed to him, only because he had somehow accidentally forgotten how good it was to be virtuous. In his soul there remained no trace of his former doubts.

"Ожидая уведомления о зачислении его в члены комитета, князь Андрей возобновил старые знакомства особенно с теми лицами, которые, он знал, были в силе и могли быть нужны ему. Он испытывал теперь в Петербурге чувство, подобное тому, какое он испытывал накануне сражения, когда его томило беспокойное любопытство и непреодолимо тянуло в высшие сферы, туда, где готовилось будущее, от которого зависели судьбы миллионов. Он чувствовал по озлоблению стариков, по любопытству непосвященных, по сдержанности посвященных, по торопливости, озабоченности всех, по бесчисленному количеству комитетов, комиссий, о существовании которых он вновь узнавал каждый день, что теперь, в 1809-м году, готовилось здесь, в Петербурге, какое-то огромное гражданское сражение, которого главнокомандующим было неизвестное ему, таинственное и представлявшееся ему гениальным, лицо — Сперанский. И самое ему смутно известное дело преобразования, и Сперанский — главный деятель, начинали так страстно интересовать его, что дело воинского устава очень скоро стало переходить в сознании его на второстепенное место.","While waiting for notification of his enrollment as a member of the committee, Prince Andrei renewed his old acquaintances, especially with those persons who, he knew, were in power and might be needed by him. He now experienced in Petersburg a feeling similar to that which he experienced on the eve of the battle, when he was tormented by restless curiosity and irresistibly drawn to higher spheres, to where the future was being prepared, on which the fate of millions depended. He felt from the anger of the old people, from the curiosity of the uninitiated, from the restraint of the initiates, from the haste and concern of everyone, from the innumerable number of committees and commissions, the existence of which he learned again every day, that now, in 1809, preparations were being made here in St. , some kind of huge civil battle, of which the commander-in-chief was an unknown to him, mysterious and seemed to him a brilliant person - Speransky. And the most vaguely known matter of transformation, and Speransky - the main figure, began to interest him so passionately that the matter of military regulations very soon began to pass in his mind to a secondary place.","While waiting to hear about his enrollment as a member of the committee, Prince Andrei renewed old acquaintances, especially with those persons whom he knew were in power and could be useful to him.

In Petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle, when troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling circles where the future, on which the fate of millions depended, was being shaped. From the irritation of the older men, the curiosity of the uninitiated, the reserve of the initiated, the hurry and preoccupation of everyone, and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose existence he learnt every day, he felt that now, in 1809, here in Petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation, the commander-in-chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know, but who was supposed to be a man of genius—Speransky. And this movement of reconstruction of which Prince Andrei had a vague idea, and Speransky its chief promoter, began to interest him so keenly that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness."

"Было морозно и ясно. Над грязными, полутемными улицами, над черными крышами стояло темное, звездное небо.

При въезде на Арбатскую площадь, огромное пространство звездного темного неба открылось глазам Пьера. Почти в середине этого неба над Пречистенским бульваром, окруженная, обсыпанная со всех сторон звездами, но отличаясь от всех близостью к земле, белым светом, и длинным, поднятым кверху хвостом, стояла огромная яркая комета 1812-го года, та самая комета, которая предвещала, как говорили, всякие ужасы и конец света. Но в Пьере светлая звезда эта с длинным лучистым хвостом не возбуждала никакого страшного чувства. Напротив Пьер радостно, мокрыми от слез глазами, смотрел на эту светлую звезду, которая, как будто, с невыразимой быстротой пролетев неизмеримые пространства по параболической линии, вдруг, как вонзившаяся стрела в землю, влепилась тут в одно избранное ею место, на черном небе, и остановилась, энергично подняв кверху хвост, светясь и играя своим белым светом между бесчисленными другими, мерцающими звездами. Пьеру казалось, что эта звезда вполне отвечала тому, что было в его расцветшей к новой жизни, размягченной и ободренной душе.","It was cold and clear.

Almost in the middle of this sky above Prechistensky Boulevard, surrounded, sprinkled on all sides with stars, but differing from all in proximity to the earth, white light, and a long tail raised upwards, stood a huge bright comet of 1812, the same comet that foreshadowed , as they said, all sorts of horrors and the end of the world. But in Pierre, this bright star with a long radiant tail did not arouse any terrible feeling. Opposite, Pierre joyfully, with eyes wet with tears, looked at this bright star, which, as if, having flown immeasurable spaces along a parabolic line with inexpressible speed, suddenly, like an arrow piercing the ground, slammed here into one place chosen by it, in the black sky, and stopped, vigorously lifting her tail up, shining and playing with her white light among countless other twinkling stars. It seemed to Pierre that this star fully corresponded to what was in his soul, which blossomed towards a new life, softened and encouraged.","It was cold and clear.

"— Ну давай спорить, — сказал князь Андрей. — Ты говоришь школы, — продолжал он, загибая палец, — поучения и так далее, то есть ты хочешь вывести его, — сказал он, указывая на мужика, снявшего шапку и проходившего мимо их, — из его животного состояния и дать ему нравственных потребностей, а мне кажется, что единственно возможное счастье — есть счастье животное, а ты его-то хочешь лишить его. Я завидую ему, а ты хочешь его сделать мною, но не дав ему моих средств. Другое ты говоришь: облегчить его работу. А по-моему, труд физический для него есть такая же необходимость, такое же условие его существования, как для меня и для тебя труд умственный. Ты не можешь не думать. Я ложусь спать в 3-м часу, мне приходят мысли, и я не могу заснуть, ворочаюсь, не сплю до утра оттого, что я думаю и не могу не думать, как он не может не пахать, не косить; иначе он пойдет в кабак, или сделается болен. Как я не перенесу его страшного физического труда, а умру через неделю, так он не перенесет моей физической праздности, он растолстеет и умрет. Третье, — что бишь еще ты сказал? — Князь Андрей загнул третий палец.","“Well, let’s argue,” said Prince Andrei. ""You're talking schools,"" he continued, bending his finger, ""sermons, and so on, that is, you want to lead him out,"" he said, pointing to a peasant who had taken off his hat and was passing by them, ""out of his animal state and to give him moral needs."" , but it seems to me that the only possible happiness is the happiness of an animal, and you want to deprive him of it. I envy him, and you want to make him me, but without giving him my means. You say something else: make his work easier.

I go to bed at 3 o’clock, thoughts come to me, and I can’t fall asleep, I toss and turn, I don’t sleep until the morning because I think and I can’t help but think, how he can’t help plowing, not mow; otherwise he will go to a tavern, or he will become ill.

But it seems to me that the only possible happiness is animal happiness, and you want to deprive him of it.

Эта благодарность напоминала ему, на сколько он еще больше бы был в состоянии сделать для этих простых, добрых людей.","He was happy with the gratitude shown to him, but he was ashamed when he accepted it.

"— Говорите, мама, что же вы молчите? Говорите, — сказала она, оглядываясь на мать, которая нежным взглядом смотрела на дочь и из-за этого созерцания, казалось, забыла всё, что она хотела сказать.","- Speak, mother, why are you silent? Speak,” she said, looking back at her mother, who was looking at her daughter with a tender look and because of this contemplation, it seemed that she forgot everything she wanted to say.","“Speak, mama, why are you silent?

Speak!’ said she, turning to her mother, who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say."

"4-го приезжает первый курьер из Петербурга. Приносят чемоданы в кабинет фельдмаршала, который любит всё делать сам. Меня зовут, чтобы помочь разобрать письма и взять те, которые назначены нам. Фельдмаршал, предоставляя нам это занятие, ждет конвертов, адресованных ему. Мы ищем — но их не оказывается. Фельдмаршал начинает волноваться, сам принимается за работу и находит письма от государя к графу Т., князю В. и другим. Он приходит в сильнейший гнев, выходит из себя, берет письма, распечатывает их и читает письма Императора, адресованные другим… Затем пишет знаменитый суточный приказ генералу Бенигсену.","On the 4th the first courier arrives from Petersburg. They bring suitcases to the office of the field marshal, who likes to do everything himself. I am called to help sort out the letters and take the ones assigned to us. The field marshal, giving us this occupation, is waiting for envelopes addressed to him. We are looking for - but they are not found. The field marshal begins to worry, he sets to work and finds letters from the sovereign to Count T., Prince V. and others. He gets extremely angry, loses his temper, takes the letters, prints them out and reads the letters of the Emperor addressed to others ... Then he writes the famous daily order to General Benigsen.","Prince Andrei began by reading with his eyes alone, but then involuntarily (though he knew how far Bilibin was to be trusted) became more and interested in what he was reading.","At first Prince Andrei read with his eyes only, but after a while in spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust Bilibin) what he read began to interest him more and more."
"Князь Андрей находился в одном из самых выгодных положений для того, чтобы быть хорошо принятым во все самые разнообразные и высшие круги тогдашнего петербургского общества. Партия преобразователей радушно принимала и заманивала его, во-первых потому, что он имел репутацию ума и большой начитанности, во-вторых потому, что он своим отпущением крестьян на волю сделал уже себе репутацию либерала. Партия стариков недовольных, прямо как к сыну своего отца, обращалась к нему за сочувствием, осуждая преобразования. Женское общество, свет, радушно принимали его, потому что он был жених, богатый и знатный, и почти новое лицо с ореолом романической истории о его мнимой смерти и трагической кончине жены. Кроме того, общий голос о нем всех, которые знали его прежде, был тот, что он много переменился к лучшему в эти пять лет, смягчился и возмужал, что не было в нем прежнего притворства, гордости и насмешливости, и было то спокойствие, которое приобретается годами. О нем заговорили, им интересовались и все желали его видеть.","Prince Andrei was in one of the most favorable positions in order to be well received in all the most diverse and highest circles of the then Petersburg society. The party of reformers cordially received and enticed him, firstly, because he had a reputation for intelligence and great erudition, and secondly, because by setting the peasants free he had already made himself a reputation as a liberal. The party of old dissatisfied, just like the son of their father, turned to him for sympathy, condemning the transformation. The sorority, the world, welcomed him, because he was a rich and noble fiancé, and almost a new face with a halo of a romantic story about his imaginary death and the tragic death of his wife. In addition, the general voice about him of all who knew him before was that he changed a lot for the better in these five years, softened and matured, that there was no former pretense, pride and mockery in him, and there was that calmness that purchased over the years. They started talking about him, they were interested in him and everyone wanted to see him.","Prince Andrei occupied one of the most advantageous positions for being well received in all the highest and most diverse circles of Petersburg society at that time. The party of the reformers cordially welcomed and courted him, first, because he had the reputation of being intelligent and well-read, and second, because by granting freedom to his peasants, he had already earned himself a reputation as a liberal. The party of the disgruntled old men turned to him directly for sympathy, as his father's son, condemning the reforms. Feminine society, the world, welcomed him cordially because he was an eligible young man, rich and well-born, and almost a new personage, with the aura of the romantic story of his alleged death and his wife's tragic end. Besides that, the general opinion of him among all who had known him before was that he had changed greatly for the better in those five years, had softened and matured, and there was none of the former affectation, pride, and mockery in him, but there was that serenity which comes with age. People talked about him, were interested in him, and everyone wished to see him.","Prince Andrei was most favourably placed to secure a good reception in the highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. The reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place because he was reputed to be clever and very well-read, and secondly because by liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal. The party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured the innovations, turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms, simply because he was the son of his father. The feminine society world welcomed him gladly, because he was rich, distinguished, a good match, and almost a newcomer, with a halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife. Besides this the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had greatly improved during these last five years, having softened and grown more masculine, lost his former affectation, pride and contemptuous irony, and acquired the serenity that comes with years. People talked about him, were interested in him, and wanted to meet him."
"— Mon pere! Andre? [Отец! Андрей?] — Сказала неграциозная, неловкая княжна с такой невыразимой прелестью печали и самозабвения, что отец не выдержал ее взгляда, и всхлипнув отвернулся.","— Mon pere! Andre? [Father! Andrei?] - Said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such an inexpressible charm of sadness and self-forgetfulness that her father could not stand her gaze, and turned away with a sob.","By her father's face, not sad, not crushed, but angry and working itself unnaturally, she could see that there, there above her, hanging over her and crushing her, was a terrible misfortune, the worst misfortune in life, one she had not yet experienced, an irreparable, inconceivable misfortune—the death of a loved one. “Mon père—André?” said the graceless, awkward princess, with such an inexpressible loveliness of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father could not endure her gaze and, sobbing, turned away.","‘Mon père, André?’—said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such an indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father could not bear her look but turned away with a sob."

"Наташа произвела сильное впечатление на Курагина. Он за ужином после театра с приемами знатока разобрал перед Долоховым достоинство ее рук, плеч, ног и волос, и объявил свое решение приволокнуться за нею.

"— Господи, помилуй нас, — твердила она, отыскивая дочь. Соня сказала, что Наташа в спальне.

"Пьер, растерянными, близорукими глазами, не повинуясь, оглянулся вокруг себя, и вдруг на него нашло сомнение. «Где я? Что я делаю? Не смеются ли надо мной? Не будет ли мне стыдно вспоминать это?» Но сомнение это продолжалось только одно мгновение. Пьер оглянулся на серьезные лица окружавших его людей, вспомнил всё, что он уже прошел, и понял, что нельзя остановиться на половине дороги. Он ужаснулся своему сомнению и, стараясь вызвать в себе прежнее чувство умиления, повергся к вратам храма. И действительно чувство умиления, еще сильнейшего, чем прежде, нашло на него. Когда он пролежал несколько времени, ему велели встать и надели на него такой же белый кожаный фартук, какие были на других, дали ему в руки лопату и три пары перчаток, и тогда великий мастер обратился к нему. Он сказал ему, чтобы он старался ничем не запятнать белизну этого фартука, представляющего крепость и непорочность; потом о невыясненной лопате сказал, чтобы он трудился ею очищать свое сердце от пороков и снисходительно заглаживать ею сердце ближнего. Потом про первые перчатки мужские сказал, что значения их он не может знать, но должен хранить их, про другие перчатки мужские сказал, что он должен надевать их в собраниях и наконец про третьи женские перчатки сказал: «Любезный брат, и сии женские перчатки вам определены суть. Отдайте их той женщине, которую вы будете почитать больше всех. Сим даром уверите в непорочности сердца вашего ту, которую изберете вы себе в достойную каменьщицу». И помолчав несколько времени, прибавил: — «Но соблюди, любезный брат, да не украшают перчатки сии рук нечистых». В то время как великий мастер произносил эти последние слова, Пьеру показалось, что председатель смутился. Пьер смутился еще больше, покраснел до слез, как краснеют дети, беспокойно стал оглядываться и произошло неловкое молчание.","Pierre, with bewildered, short-sighted eyes, disobeying, looked around him, and suddenly doubt came over him. ""Where I am? What am I doing? Are they laughing at me? Wouldn't I be ashamed to remember this?"" But this doubt lasted only for a moment. Pierre looked around at the serious faces of the people around him, remembered everything that he had already passed, and realized that it was impossible to stop halfway. He was horrified by his doubt and, trying to evoke in himself the former feeling of compunction, he threw himself at the gates of the temple. And indeed a feeling of compunction, even stronger than before, came over him. When he lay for some time, they told him to get up and put on him the same white leather apron that the others had on, gave him a shovel and three pairs of gloves, and then the great master turned to him. He told him to be careful not to stain the whiteness of this apron, representing strength and purity; then he said of an unexplained shovel that he should work with it to cleanse his heart of vices and condescendingly smooth over the heart of his neighbor with it. Then about the first men's gloves he said that he could not know their meaning, but he must keep them, about other men's gloves he said that he should wear them in meetings, and finally about the third women's gloves he said: the essence is defined. Give them to the woman you will revere the most. With this gift, assure the purity of your heart to the one you choose for yourself as a worthy stonemason. And after a pause for a while, he added: “But observe, dear brother, that the gloves of these unclean hands do not adorn.” While the great master uttered these last words, it seemed to Pierre that the chairman was embarrassed. Pierre became even more embarrassed, blushed to tears, as children blush, began to look around uneasily, and there was an awkward silence.","Pierre looked around perplexedly with his nearsighted eyes, not obeying, and doubt suddenly came over him: “Where am I? What am I doing? Aren't they laughing at me? Won't I be ashamed to remember it?” But this doubt lasted only a moment. Pierre looked at the serious faces of the people around him, remembered all he had already gone through, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was horrified at his doubt, and, trying to recall his former tender feeling, he prostrated at the gates of the temple. And indeed a tender feeling still stronger than before came over him. After he had lain there for some time, they told him to get up and put on a white leather apron such as the others were wearing, handed him a trowel and three pairs of gloves, and then the grand master addressed him. He told him to try not to stain in any way the whiteness of this apron, which represented strength and blamelessness; then, of the unexplained trowel, he told him to work with it to purify his heart of vice and tolerantly smooth over the heart of his neighbor. Then, of the first pair of men's gloves, he said that Pierre could not know their meaning, but had to know them; of the second pair of men's gloves, he said that he was to wear them at meetings; and, finally, of the third pair, which were women's gloves, he said: “My gentle brother, these women's gloves are destined for you as well. Give them to the woman whom you honor most of all. By this gift you will give assurance of the blamelessness of your heart to the one whom you elect as your worthy lady Mason.” After a pause, he added: “But preserve these gloves, gentle brother, that they not adorn unclean hands.” Just as the grand master pronounced these last words, it seemed to Pierre that the chairman became embarrassed. Pierre became still more embarrassed, blushed to the point of tears, as children do, started looking around uneasily, and an awkward silence ensued.","Pierre, perplexed, looked round with his short-sighted eyes without obeying, and suddenly doubts rose in his mind. ‘Where am I? What am I doing? Aren’t they laughing at me? Won’t I be ashamed to remember this?’ But these doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre glanced at the serious faces of those around, remembered all he had already gone through, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was aghast at his hesitation, and trying to arouse his former devotional feeling, prostrated himself before the Gates of the Temple. And really the feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before. When he had lain there some time he was told to get up, and a white leather apron such as the others wore was put on him; he was given a trowel and three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand Master addressed him. He told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that apron, which symbolized strength and purity; then of the unexplained trowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice, and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbour. As to the first pair of gloves, a man’s, he said that Pierre could not know their meaning but must keep them. The second pair of man’s gloves he was to wear at the meetings, and finally of the third, a pair of women’s gloves, he said: ‘Dear brother, these woman’s gloves are intended for you too. Give them to the woman whom you shall honour most of all. This gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select to be your worthy helpmeet in masonry.’ And after a pause he added: ‘But beware, dear brother, that these gloves do not deck hands that are unclean.’ While the Grand Master said these last words it seemed to Pierre that he grew embarrassed. Pierre himself grew still more confused, blushed like a child till tears came into his eyes, began looking about him uneasily, and an awkward pause followed."
"— Здоровье государя императора! — крикнул он, и в ту же минуту добрые глаза его увлажились слезами радости и восторга. В ту же минуту заиграли: «Гром победы раздавайся». Все встали с своих мест и закричали ура! и Багратион закричал ура! тем же голосом, каким он кричал на Шенграбенском поле. Восторженный голос молодого Ростова был слышен из-за всех 300 голосов. Он чуть не плакал. — Здоровье государя императора, — кричал он, — ура! — Выпив залпом свой бокал, он бросил его на пол. Многие последовали его примеру. И долго продолжались громкие крики. Когда замолкли голоса, лакеи подобрали разбитую посуду, и все стали усаживаться, и улыбаясь своему крику переговариваться. Граф Илья Андреич поднялся опять, взглянул на записочку, лежавшую подле его тарелки и провозгласил тост за здоровье героя нашей последней кампании, князя Петра Ивановича Багратиона и опять голубые глаза графа увлажились слезами. Ура! опять закричали голоса 300 гостей, и вместо музыки послышались певчие, певшие кантату сочинения Павла Ивановича Кутузова.","“Health of the Sovereign Emperor!” he shouted, and at the same moment his kind eyes were moistened with tears of joy and delight.

Young Rostov's rapturous voice could be heard above the other three hundred voices. He was almost weeping. “To the health of the sovereign emperor!” he cried. “Hurrah!” Emptying his glass at one gulp, he flung it on the floor. Many followed his example. And the loud shouts continued for a long time. When the voices died down, the servants cleared away the broken glass, and everybody began to take their seats, smiling at their own shouts and talking among themselves. Count Ilya Andreevich rose again, glanced at the little note that lay next to his plate, and pronounced a toast to the health of the hero of our latest campaign, Prince Pyotr Ivanovich Bagration, and again the count's blue eyes grew moist with tears. “Hurrah!” the voices of the three hundred guests shouted again, and, instead of music, a choir was heard, singing a cantata composed by Pavel Ivanovich Kutuzov:[92]","‘To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!’ he cried, and at the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm. The band immediately struck up ‘Conquest’s joyful thunder waken …’ All rose and cried ‘hurrah!’ Bagration also rose, and shouted ‘hurrah!’ in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at Schön Grabern. Young Rostov’s ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundred others. He nearly wept. ‘ To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!’ he roared, ‘hurrah!’ and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor. Many followed his example, and the loud shouting continued for a long time. When the voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody sat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and exchanging remarks. The old count rose once more, glanced at a note lying beside his plate, and proposed a toast, ‘To the health of the hero of our last campaign, Prince Pyotr Ivanovich Bagration!’, and again his blue eyes grew moist. ‘Hurrah!’ cried the three hundred voices again, but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed by Paul Ivanovich Kutuzov:"

"«Ваша потеря так ужасна, что я иначе не могу себе объяснить ее, как особенную милость Бога, Который хочет испытать — любя вас — вас и вашу превосходную мать. Ах, мой друг, религия, и только одна религия, может нас, уже не говорю утешить, но избавить от отчаяния; одна религия может объяснить нам то, чего без ее помощи не может понять человек: для чего, зачем существа добрые, возвышенные, умеющие находить счастие в жизни, никому не только не вредящие, но необходимые для счастия других — призываются к Богу, а остаются жить злые, бесполезные, вредные, или такие, которые в тягость себе и другим. Первая смерть, которую я видела и которую никогда не забуду — смерть моей милой невестки, произвела на меня такое впечатление. Точно так же как вы спрашиваете судьбу, для чего было умирать вашему прекрасному брату, точно так же спрашивала я, для чего было умирать этому ангелу-Лизе, которая не только не сделала какого-нибудь зла человеку, но никогда кроме добрых мыслей не имела в своей душе. И что ж, мой друг, вот прошло с тех пор пять лет, и я, с своим ничтожным умом, уже начинаю ясно понимать, для чего ей нужно было умереть, и каким образом эта смерть была только выражением бесконечной благости Творца, все действия Которого, хотя мы их большею частью не понимаем, суть только проявления Его бесконечной любви к Своему творению. Может быть, я часто думаю, она была слишком ангельски-невинна для того, чтобы иметь силу перенести все обязанности матери. Она была безупречна, как молодая жена; может быть, она не могла бы быть такою матерью. Теперь, мало того, что она оставила нам, и в особенности князю Андрею, самое чистое сожаление и воспоминание, она там вероятно получит то место, которого я не смею надеяться для себя. Но, не говоря уже о ней одной, эта ранняя и страшная смерть имела самое благотворное влияние, несмотря на всю печаль, на меня и на брата. Тогда, в минуту потери, эти мысли не могли притти мне; тогда я с ужасом отогнала бы их, но теперь это так ясно и несомненно. Пишу всё это вам, мой друг, только для того, чтобы убедить вас в евангельской истине, сделавшейся для меня жизненным правилом: ни один волос с головы не упадет без Его воли. А воля Его руководствуется только одною беспредельною любовью к нам, и потому всё, что ни случается с нами, всё для нашего блага. Вы спрашиваете, проведем ли мы следующую зиму в Москве? Несмотря на всё желание вас видеть, не думаю и не желаю этого. И вы удивитесь, что причиною тому Буонапарте. И вот почему: здоровье отца моего заметно слабеет: он не может переносить противоречий и делается раздражителен. Раздражительность эта, как вы знаете, обращена преимущественно на политические дела. Он не может перенести мысли о том, что Буонапарте ведет дело как с равными, со всеми государями Европы и в особенности с нашим, внуком Великой Екатерины! Как вы знаете, я совершенно равнодушна к политическим делам, но из слов моего отца и разговоров его с Михаилом Ивановичем, я знаю всё, что делается в мире, и в особенности все почести, воздаваемые Буонапарте, которого, как кажется, еще только в Лысых Горах на всем земном шаре не признают ни великим человеком, ни еще менее французским императором. И мой отец не может переносить этого. Мне кажется, что мой отец, преимущественно вследствие своего взгляда на политические дела и предвидя столкновения, которые у него будут, вследствие его манеры, не стесняясь ни с кем, высказывать свои мнения, неохотно говорит о поездке в Москву. Всё, что он выиграет от лечения, он потеряет вследствие споров о Буонапарте, которые неминуемы. Во всяком случае это решится очень скоро. Семейная жизнь наша идет по старому, за исключением присутствия брата Андрея. Он, как я уже писала вам, очень изменился последнее время. После его горя, он теперь только, в нынешнем году, совершенно нравственно ожил. Он стал таким, каким я его знала ребенком: добрым, нежным, с тем золотым сердцем, которому я не знаю равного. Он понял, как мне кажется, что жизнь для него не кончена. Но вместе с этой нравственной переменой, он физически очень ослабел. Он стал худее чем прежде, нервнее. Я боюсь за него и рада, что он предпринял эту поездку за границу, которую доктора уже давно предписывали ему. Я надеюсь, что это поправит его. Вы мне пишете, что в Петербурге о нем говорят, как об одном из самых деятельных, образованных и умных молодых людей. Простите за самолюбие родства — я никогда в этом не сомневалась. Нельзя счесть добро, которое он здесь сделал всем, начиная с своих мужиков и до дворян. Приехав в Петербург, он взял только то, что ему следовало. Удивляюсь, каким образом вообще доходят слухи из Петербурга в Москву и особенно такие неверные, как тот, о котором вы мне пишете, — слух о мнимой женитьбе брата на маленькой Ростовой. Я не думаю, чтобы Андрей когда-нибудь женился на ком бы то ни было и в особенности на ней. И вот почему: во-первых я знаю, что хотя он и редко говорит о покойной жене, но печаль этой потери слишком глубоко вкоренилась в его сердце, чтобы когда-нибудь он решился дать ей преемницу и мачеху нашему маленькому ангелу. Во-вторых потому, что, сколько я знаю, эта девушка не из того разряда женщин, которые могут нравиться князю Андрею. Не думаю, чтобы князь Андрей выбрал ее своею женою, и откровенно скажу: я не желаю этого. Но я заболталась, кончаю свой второй листок. Прощайте, мой милый друг; да сохранит вас Бог под Своим святым и могучим покровом. Моя милая подруга, mademoiselle Bourienne, целует вас.","“Your loss is so terrible that I can’t explain it to myself otherwise than as a special favor of God, who wants to experience – loving you – you and your excellent mother. Ah, my friend, religion, and only one religion, can comfort us, not to say, but deliver us from despair; one religion can explain to us what a person cannot understand without its help: why, why are good, exalted beings, able to find happiness in life, not only not harming anyone, but necessary for the happiness of others, are called to God, but remain to live evil, useless, harmful, or those that are a burden to themselves and others. The first death I saw and will never forget, the death of my dear sister-in-law, made such an impression on me. Just as you ask fate why your beautiful brother had to die, so I asked why this angel Liza died, who not only did not do any harm to a person, but never had other than good thoughts in her mind. to your soul. And well, my friend, five years have passed since then, and I, with my insignificant mind, already begin to clearly understand why she had to die, and how this death was only an expression of the infinite goodness of the Creator, all of whose actions , although we mostly do not understand them, are only manifestations of His infinite love for His creation. Maybe, I often think, she was too angelically innocent to have the strength to bear all the responsibilities of a mother. She was flawless as a young wife; perhaps she could not be such a mother. Now, not only did she leave us, and especially Prince Andrei, the purest regret and remembrance, she will probably get there the place that I do not dare to hope for myself. But, not to mention her alone, this early and terrible death had the most beneficial effect, despite all the sadness, on me and on my brother. Then, in the moment of loss, these thoughts could not come to me; then I would have driven them away with horror, but now it is so clear and undeniable. I am writing all this to you, my friend, only to convince you of the gospel truth, which has become a life rule for me: not a single hair will fall from my head without His will. And His will is guided only by one boundless love for us, and therefore everything that happens to us is all for our good. Are you asking if we will spend next winter in Moscow? Despite all the desire to see you, I do not think and do not want it. And you will be surprised that the reason for this is Buonaparte. And here's why: my father's health is noticeably weakening: he cannot bear contradictions and becomes irritable. This irritability, as you know, is mainly directed towards political affairs. He cannot bear the thought that Buonaparte deals with all the sovereigns of Europe as equals, and especially with our grandson of Great Catherine! As you know, I am completely indifferent to political affairs, but from the words of my father and his conversations with Mikhail Ivanovich, I know everything that is happening in the world, and in particular all the honors paid to Buonaparte, who, as it seems, is still only in Lysy Mountains throughout the globe are not recognized either as a great man, or even less as a French emperor. And my father can't stand it. It seems to me that my father, mainly because of his view of political affairs and foreseeing the clashes that he will have, because of his manner, not embarrassed to express his opinions with anyone, is reluctant to talk about a trip to Moscow. Whatever he gains from the treatment, he will lose in the inevitable Buonaparte controversy. In any case, this will be resolved very soon. Our family life goes on as before, with the exception of the presence of brother Andrei. He, as I wrote to you, has changed a lot lately. After his grief, only now, this year, he completely morally revived. He became the way I knew him as a child: kind, gentle, with that golden heart, to which I know no equal. He realized, it seems to me, that life is not over for him. But along with this moral change, he became very physically weak. He became thinner than before, more nervous. I fear for him and am glad that he has undertaken this trip abroad, which the doctors have long prescribed for him. I hope this fixes it. You write to me that in Petersburg they talk about him as one of the most active, educated and intelligent young people. Forgive the pride of kinship - I never doubted it. It is impossible to count the good that he did here to everyone, from his peasants to the nobles. Arriving in Petersburg, he took only what he needed. I wonder how rumors get from Petersburg to Moscow at all, and especially such untrue ones as the one about which you write to me - a rumor about an imaginary marriage of a brother to little Rostova. I don't think Andrei would ever marry anyone, and especially not her. And here's why: firstly, I know that although he rarely talks about his deceased wife, the sadness of this loss is too deeply rooted in his heart for him to ever decide to give her a successor and stepmother to our little angel. Secondly, because, as far as I know, this girl is not from the category of women that Prince Andrei might like. I do not think that Prince Andrei would choose her as his wife, and I will frankly say: I do not want this. But I chatted, I'm finishing my second sheet. Farewell, my dear friend; may God keep you under His holy and mighty cover. My dear friend, mademoiselle Bourienne, kisses you.","Your loss is so terrible that I cannot explain it to myself otherwise than as a special mercy of God, who—loving you—wants to test you and your excellent mother.

And my father cannot bear that. It seems to me that my father, mostly owing to his view of political affairs, and foreseeing the clashes he will have, owing to his manner of voicing his opinions without any restraint, is reluctant to speak of going to Moscow. All that he gains from treatment, he will lose owing to his arguments about Buonaparte, which are inevitable. In any case, this will be decided very soon.

It's impossible to calculate the good he has done here for everyone, from his peasants to the gentry. On coming to Petersburg, he only received his due. I wonder how rumors generally get from Petersburg to Moscow, and especially such false ones as the one you write to me about—the rumor of the supposed marriage of my brother to the little Rostov girl. I do not think Andrei will every marry anyone, and especially not her. And here is why: first, I know that, though he rarely speaks of his late wife, the grief of that loss is too deeply rooted in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and a stepmother to our little angel.

I do not think that Prince Andrei would choose her for his wife, and I will tell you frankly: I do not wish it. But I am babbling away, coming to the end of my second sheet.

And my father cannot stand this. It seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing his views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might derive from a course of treatment, he would lose as a result of the disputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In any case it will be decided very shortly. Our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother Andrei’s absence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much of late.

"Они стояли биваками. Денисов с Ростовым жили в вырытой для них солдатами землянке, покрытой сучьями и дерном. Землянка была устроена следующим, вошедшим тогда в моду, способом: прорывалась канава в полтора аршина ширины, два — глубины и три с половиной длины. С одного конца канавы делались ступеньки, и это был сход, крыльцо; сама канава была комната, в которой у счастливых, как у эскадронного командира, в дальней, противуположной ступеням стороне, лежала на кольях, доска — это был стол. С обеих сторон вдоль канавы была снята на аршин земля, и это были две кровати и диваны. Крыша устраивалась так, что в середине можно было стоять, а на кровати даже можно было сидеть, ежели подвинуться ближе к столу. У Денисова, жившего роскошно, потому что солдаты его эскадрона любили его, была еще доска в фронтоне крыши, и в этой доске было разбитое, но склеенное стекло. Когда было очень холодно, то к ступеням (в приемную, как называл Денисов эту часть балагана), приносили на железном загнутом листе жар из солдатских костров, и делалось так тепло, что офицеры, которых много всегда бывало у Денисова и Ростова, сидели в одних рубашках.","They bivouacked. Denisov and Rostov lived in a dugout dug for them by soldiers, covered with branches and turf. The dugout was arranged in the following way, which then became fashionable: a ditch was cut through one and a half arshins wide, two arshins deep and three and a half lengths. Steps were made from one end of the ditch, and this was a descent, a porch; the ditch itself was a room in which the happy, like a squadron commander, on the far side opposite the steps, lay on stakes, a board - it was a table. On both sides, along the ditch, a yard of earth was removed, and these were two beds and sofas. The roof was arranged in such a way that one could stand in the middle, and one could even sit on the bed if one moved closer to the table. Denisov, who lived luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron loved him, also had a board in the gable of the roof, and in this board there was broken but glued glass. When it was very cold, heat was brought to the steps (to the reception room, as Denisov called this part of the booth), on an iron bent sheet, from soldiers' fires, and it became so warm that the officers, of whom Denisov and Rostov always had many, sat in the same shirts.","They were on bivouac. Denisov and Rostov lived in a dugout covered with branches and turf that the soldiers had made for them. The dugout was made in the following way, which had then come into fashion: a trench was dug four feet wide, five feet deep, and nine feet long. At one end of the dugout, steps were made, and this was the way down, the entrance; the trench itself was the room, in which the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board lying on four posts at the far end—this was a table. Along both sides of the trench, earth was removed to a width of two and a half feet, and this made two beds or couches. The roof was constructed in such a way that one could stand up in the middle, and one could even sit up on the beds if one moved closer to the table. Denisov, who lived in luxury, because the soldiers of his squadron loved him, also had a board in the pediment of the roof with a piece of broken but mended glass set into it. When it was very cold, hot coals from the soldiers' bonfires were brought to the steps (the anteroom, as Denisov called this part of the shed) on a bent piece of sheet iron, and it became so warm that the officers, of whom there were always many with Rostov and Denisov, sat in nothing but their shirts.","They were bivouacking. Denisov and Rostov were living in an earth hut, dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf. The hut was made in the following manner, which had then come into vogue. A trench was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eight inches deep, and eight feet long. At one end of the trench steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself was the room, in which the lucky ones, such as the squadron-commander, had a board lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table. On each side of the trench the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet, and this did duty for bedsteads and couches. The roof was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench, and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table. Denisov, who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron liked him, had also a board in the roof at the farther end, with a piece of (broken but mended) glass in it for a window. When it was very cold, embers from the soldiers’ camp-fire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the ‘reception room’—as Denisov called that part of the hut—and it was then so warm that the officers, of whom there were always some with Denisov and Rostov, sat in their shirtsleeves."

"Торжковская торговка визгливым голосом предлагала свой товар и в особенности козловые туфли. «У меня сотни рублей, которых мне некуда деть, а она в прорванной шубе стоит и робко смотрит на меня, — думал Пьер. И зачем нужны эти деньги? Точно на один волос могут прибавить ей счастья, спокойствия души, эти деньги? Разве может что-нибудь в мире сделать ее и меня менее подверженными злу и смерти? Смерть, которая всё кончит и которая должна притти нынче или завтра — всё равно через мгновение, в сравнении с вечностью». И он опять нажимал на ничего не захватывающий винт, и винт всё так же вертелся на одном и том же месте.","The Torzhkovskaya tradeswoman offered her goods in a shrill voice, and especially goat shoes. “I have hundreds of rubles, which I have nowhere to put, and she stands in a torn fur coat and looks timidly at me,” thought Pierre. And why do we need this money? Precisely for one hair, this money can add to her happiness, peace of mind? Can anything in the world make her and me less subject to evil and death? Death, which will end everything and which must come today or tomorrow - all the same in a moment, in comparison with eternity. And he again pressed on the screw, which was not grasping anything, and the screw was still spinning in the same place.","The Torzhok peddler woman offered him her wares in a shrill voice, especially a pair of goatskin shoes. “I have hundreds of roubles that I don't know what to do with, and she stands there in a tattered coat and looks at me timidly,” thought Pierre. “And what does she need the money for? As if this money can add one hair's breadth to her happiness, her peace of mind? Can anything in the world make her or me less subject to evil and death?

As if that money could add a hair’s breadth to her happiness or peace of mind.

"Вообще главная черта ума Сперанского, поразившая князя Андрея, была несомненная, непоколебимая вера в силу и законность ума. Видно было, что никогда Сперанскому не могла притти в голову та обыкновенная для князя Андрея мысль, что нельзя всё-таки выразить всего того, что думаешь, и никогда не приходило сомнение в том, что не вздор ли всё то, что я думаю и всё то, во что я верю?

"Николай слез с лошади, остановился подле гончих с подъехавшими Наташей и Петей, ожидая сведений о том, чем кончится дело.

"Читая эти письма, Николай испытывал страх, что хотят вывести его из той среды, в которой он, оградив себя от всей житейской путаницы, жил так тихо и спокойно. Он чувствовал, что рано или поздно придется опять вступить в тот омут жизни с расстройствами и поправлениями дел, с учетами управляющих, ссорами, интригами, с связями, с обществом, с любовью Сони и обещанием ей. Всё это было страшно трудно, запутано, и он отвечал на письма матери, холодными классическими письмами, начинавшимися: Ma chere maman [Моя милая матушка] и кончавшимися: votre obeissant fils, [Ваш послушный сын, ] умалчивая о том, когда он намерен приехать. В 1810 году он получил письма родных, в которых извещали его о помолвке Наташи с Болконским и о том, что свадьба будет через год, потому что старый князь не согласен. Это письмо огорчило, оскорбило Николая. Во-первых, ему жалко было потерять из дома Наташу, которую он любил больше всех из семьи; во-вторых, он с своей гусарской точки зрения жалел о том, что его не было при этом, потому что он бы показал этому Болконскому, что совсем не такая большая честь родство с ним и что, ежели он любит Наташу, то может обойтись и без разрешения сумасбродного отца. Минуту он колебался не попроситься ли в отпуск, чтоб увидать Наташу невестой, но тут подошли маневры, пришли соображения о Соне, о путанице, и Николай опять отложил. Но весной того же года он получил письмо матери, писавшей тайно от графа, и письмо это убедило его ехать. Она писала, что ежели Николай не приедет и не возьмется за дела, то всё именье пойдет с молотка и все пойдут по миру. Граф так слаб, так вверился Митеньке, и так добр, и так все его обманывают, что всё идет хуже и хуже. «Ради Бога, умоляю тебя, приезжай сейчас же, ежели ты не хочешь сделать меня и всё твое семейство несчастными», писала графиня.","Reading these letters, Nikolai was afraid that they wanted to take him out of the environment in which, having protected himself from all worldly confusion, he lived so quietly and calmly. He felt that sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life with frustrations and corrections of affairs, with accounting for managers, quarrels, intrigues, with connections, with society, with Sonya's love and promise to her. It was all terribly difficult, confusing, and he answered his mother's letters with cold classic letters that began: Ma chere maman [My dear mother] and ended: votre obeissant fils, [Your obedient son,] silent about when he intended to arrive . In 1810, he received letters from his relatives, in which they informed him of Natasha's engagement to Bolkonsky and that the wedding would be in a year, because the old prince did not agree. This letter upset, offended Nikolai. Firstly, he was sorry to lose Natasha from home, whom he loved more than anyone else in the family; secondly, from his hussar point of view, he regretted that he was not there, because he would have shown this Bolkonsky that it was not at all such a great honor to be related to him and that if he loves Natasha, then he can do without without the permission of the crazy father. For a minute he hesitated whether to ask for leave to see Natasha as a bride, but then maneuvers came up, considerations came about Sonya, about the confusion, and Nikolai again put it off. But in the spring of that year, he received a letter from his mother, who wrote secretly from the count, and this letter convinced him to go. She wrote that if Nikolai did not come and take up business, then the whole estate would go under the hammer and everyone would go around the world. The count is so weak, he trusts Mitenka so much, and he is so kind, and everyone deceives him so much that everything goes from bad to worse. “For God's sake, I beg you, come now if you don't want to make me and your whole family unhappy,” the countess wrote.","Reading these letters, Nikolai experienced a fear that they wanted to make him leave the milieu in which he lived calmly and peacefully, protected from life's confusion. He felt that sooner or later he would have to enter the deep water of life again, with its affairs disordered and straightened out, with its stewards' accounts, with its quarrels, intrigues, connections, with its society, with Sonya's love and his promise to her. All this was terribly difficult, confused, and he answered his mother's letters with cold, classical ones that began “Ma chère maman” and ended “votre obéissant fils,”[356] and omitted saying when he intended to return. In 1810 he received letters from his parents in which they informed him of Natasha's engagement to Bolkonsky and that the wedding would take place in a year, because the old prince was against it. This letter upset and insulted Nikolai. First of all, he felt sorry that Natasha, whom he loved most of all in the family, would be leaving home; second, from his hussar point of view, he was sorry he was not there to show this Bolkonsky that connection with him was by no means so great an honor, and that if he loved Natasha, he could do without the permission of his crackbrained father. For a moment he hesitated whether he should not ask for a leave in order to see Natasha as a fiancée, but then came maneuvers, considerations about Sonya, about the confusion, and Nikolai put it off again. But in the spring of that year he received a letter from his mother, written in secret from the count, and this letter persuaded him to go. She wrote that if Nikolai did not come and take things in hand, their property would be sold at auction, and they would all go begging. The count was so weak, so trusting in Mitenka, and so kind, and everyone deceived him so, that it was all getting worse and worse. “For God's sake, I beg you, come at once, if you don't want to make me and your whole family miserable,” wrote the countess.","Reading these letters Nikolai felt a dread of their wanting to take him away from surroundings in which, protected from all the entanglements of life, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt that sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out, its accounts with stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, society, and with Sonya’s love and his promise to her. It was all dreadfully difficult and complicated; and he replied to his mother in cold, formal letters in French, beginning: ‘Ma chère maman’ and ending: ‘Votre obéissant fils,’2 which said nothing of when he would return. In 1810 he received letters from his parents in which they told him of Natasha’s engagement to Bolkonsky, and that the wedding would be in a year’s time because the old prince made difficulties. This letter grieved and mortified Nikolai. In the first place he was sorry that Natasha, for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family, should be lost to the home; and secondly, from his hussar point of view, he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow Bolkonsky that connection with him was no such great honour after all, and that if he loved Natasha he might dispense with permission from his dotard father. For a moment he hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see Natasha before she was married, but then came the manoeuvres, and considerations about Sonya and about the confusion of their affairs, and Nikolai again put it off. But in the spring of that year he received a letter from his mother, written without his father’s knowledge, and that letter persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not come and take matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and they would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and trusted Mitenka so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody took advantage of him and things were going from bad to worse. ‘ For God’s sake, I implore you, come at once, if you do not wish to make me and the whole family wretched,’ wrote the countess."

"Балашев застал маршала Даву в сарае крестьянскои избы, сидящего на бочонке и занятого письменными работами (он поверял счеты). Адъютант стоял подле него.

Assuming a calm tone, he discussed the whole matter:","His father received his son’s communication with external composure, but inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life was already ending. ‘If only they would let me end my days as I want to,’ thought the old man, ‘then they might do as they please.’ With his son, however, he employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and, adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole matter."

"Граф, забыв стереть улыбку с лица, смотрел перед собой вдаль по перемычке и, не нюхая, держал в руке табакерку. Вслед за лаем собак послышался голос по волку, поданный в басистый рог Данилы; стая присоединилась к первым трем собакам и слышно было, как заревели с заливом голоса гончих, с тем особенным подвыванием, которое служило признаком гона по волку. Доезжачие уже не порскали, а улюлюкали, и из-за всех голосов выступал голос Данилы, то басистый, то пронзительно-тонкий.

Those who arrived no longer squealed, but hooted, and from behind all the voices Danila's voice came out, now bass, now piercingly thin. Danila's voice seemed to fill the whole forest, came out from behind the forest and sounded far into the field.","The count, forgetting to wipe the smile from his face, looked straight into the distance along the line of trees, and held the snuffbox in his hand without taking a pinch. Following the dogs' barking came the bass sound of Danilo's horn, calling after the wolf; the pack joined the first three dogs, and one could hear the baying of the hounds in full cry, with that special yelping that signals the pursuit of a wolf. The kennelmen no longer shouted, but hallooed, and Danilo's voice rose above all the others, now bass, now piercingly shrill. Danilo's voice seemed to fill the whole woods, emerge, and spread far across the field.","The count, forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face, looked into the distance straight before him, down the narrow open space, holding the snuff-box in his hand but not taking any.

The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds, but changed to the cry of ulyulyu, and above the others rose Danilo’s voice, now a deep bass, now piercingly shrill.

"«Давно я ждала тебя», как будто сказала эта испуганная и счастливая девочка, своей проявившейся из-за готовых слез улыбкой, поднимая свою руку на плечо князя Андрея. Они были вторая пара, вошедшая в круг. Князь Андрей был одним из лучших танцоров своего времени. Наташа танцовала превосходно. Ножки ее в бальных атласных башмачках быстро, легко и независимо от нее делали свое дело, а лицо ее сияло восторгом счастия. Ее оголенные шея и руки были худы и некрасивы. В сравнении с плечами Элен, ее плечи были худы, грудь неопределенна, руки тонки; но на Элен был уже как будто лак от всех тысяч взглядов, скользивших по ее телу, а Наташа казалась девочкой, которую в первый раз оголили, и которой бы очень стыдно это было, ежели бы ее не уверили, что это так необходимо надо.","“I have been waiting for you for a long time,” as if this frightened and happy girl said, with her smile that appeared because of ready tears, raising her hand on the shoulder of Prince Andrei. They were the second couple to enter the circle. Prince Andrei was one of the best dancers of his time. Natasha danced superbly. Her feet in ballroom satin shoes quickly, easily and independently of her did their job, and her face shone with the delight of happiness. Her bare neck and arms were thin and ugly. Compared to Helen's shoulders, her shoulders were thin, her chest indefinite, her arms thin; but Helen already seemed to have varnish from all the thousands of glances that glided over her body, and Natasha seemed like a girl who was naked for the first time, and who would be very ashamed of it if she had not been assured that it was so necessary.","“I've been waiting a long time for you,” this frightened and happy girl seemed to say by her smile, shining through ready tears, as she raised her arm to Prince Andrei's shoulder.

Some managers (there were also semi-literate housekeepers) listened frightened, suggesting the meaning of the speech was that the young count was dissatisfied with their management and concealment of money; others, after the first fear, found Pierre's lisping and new, unheard-of words amusing; still others simply found the pleasure of listening to the master speak; the fourth, the most intelligent, including the chief manager, understood from this speech how to deal with the master in order to achieve their goals.","On reaching Kiev, Pierre summoned all his stewards to the main office and explained his intentions and wishes to them.

There's a dog ... outran them all, a thousand roubles or one—right you are!” he said, gasping and looking around angrily, as if scolding someone, as if they were all his enemies, as if they had all offended him, and he had only now finally managed to vindicate himself. “There's your thousand-ruble dogs for you—right you are!”","That’s it, come on! That’s a dog! … There, it has beaten them all, the thousand-ruble as well as the one-ruble borzois.

"— Нет, матушка, разойтись, разойтись, это вы знайте, знайте! Я теперь больше не могу, — сказал он и вышел из комнаты. И как будто боясь, чтобы она не сумела как-нибудь утешиться, он вернулся к ней и, стараясь принять спокойный вид, прибавил: — И не думайте, чтобы я это сказал вам в минуту сердца, а я спокоен, и я обдумал это; и это будет — разойтись, поищите себе места!.. — Но он не выдержал и с тем озлоблением, которое может быть только у человека, который любит, он, видимо сам страдая, затряс кулаками и прокричал ей:","- No, mother, disperse, disperse, you know it, know it! I can't do it anymore,"" he said and left the room. And as if afraid that she might not be able to somehow console herself, he returned to her and, trying to assume a calm air, added: “And don’t think that I said this to you in a moment of my heart, but I am calm, and I thought it over; and it will be - disperse, look for a place for yourself! .. - But he could not stand it, and with that anger that only a person who loves can have, he, apparently suffering himself, shook his fists and shouted to her:","“No, my dear, we must part, we must part, let it be known to you! I cannot have it anymore,” he said and left the room. And, as if fearing she might somehow comfort herself, he came back and, trying to assume a calm look, added: “Don't think I said it to you in a moment of anger, I am calm, and I have thought it over; and it will be—we must part, find yourself a place! ...” But he could not control himself and with that spitefulness which belongs only to someone who loves, he shook his fists at her, obviously suffering, and screamed:","‘No, madame! We must part, we must part! Understand that, understand it! I cannot endure any more,’ he said, and left the room. Then, as if afraid she might find some means of consolation, he returned and trying to appear calm added: ‘And don’t imagine I have said this in a moment of anger. I am calm, I have thought it over, and it will be carried out— we must part; so find some place for yourself! …’ But he could not restrain himself and, with the virulence of which only one who loves is capable, evidently suffering himself, he shook his fists at her and screamed:"

"— Мне это очень нужно, — сказала она с улыбкой, оглядываясь на Анну Павловну, и Анна Павловна той грустной улыбкой, которая сопровождала ее слова при речи о своей высокой покровительнице, подтвердила желание Элен.

She seemed to promise him that when he arrived on Tuesday, she would explain this necessity to him.","“It's very necessary for me,” she said with a smile, glancing at Anna Pavlovna, and Anna Pavlovna, with the same sad smile that accompanied her words when her exalted patroness was mentioned, seconded Hélène's wish.

"Вошел смотритель и униженно стал просить его сиятельство подождать только два часика, после которых он для его сиятельства (что будет, то будет) даст курьерских. Смотритель очевидно врал и хотел только получить с проезжего лишние деньги. «Дурно ли это было или хорошо?», спрашивал себя Пьер. «Для меня хорошо, для другого проезжающего дурно, а для него самого неизбежно, потому что ему есть нечего: он говорил, что его прибил за это офицер. А офицер прибил за то, что ему ехать надо было скорее. А я стрелял в Долохова за то, что я счел себя оскорбленным, а Людовика XVI казнили за то, что его считали преступником, а через год убили тех, кто его казнил, тоже за что-то. Что дурно? Что хорошо? Что надо любить, что ненавидеть? Для чего жить, и что такое я? Что такое жизнь, что смерть? Какая сила управляет всем?», спрашивал он себя. И не было ответа ни на один из этих вопросов, кроме одного, не логического ответа, вовсе не на эти вопросы. Ответ этот был: «умрешь — всё кончится. Умрешь и всё узнаешь, или перестанешь спрашивать». Но и умереть было страшно.","The superintendent entered and humbly began to ask his excellency to wait only two hours, after which he would give courier for his excellency (what will be, will be). The caretaker obviously lied and only wanted to get extra money from the traveler. “Was it bad or good?” Pierre asked himself. “It’s good for me, it’s bad for another passing by, but it’s inevitable for him, because he has nothing to eat: he said that an officer beat him up for this. And the officer nailed him because he had to go sooner. And I shot at Dolokhov because I considered myself insulted, and Louis XVI was executed because he was considered a criminal, and a year later those who executed him were also killed for something. What's wrong? What well? What should you love, what should you hate? Why live, and what am I? What is life, what is death? What power governs everything?” he asked himself. And there was no answer to any of these questions, except for one, not a logical answer, not at all to these questions. This answer was: “If you die, everything will end. You will die and you will know everything, or you will stop asking.” But it was also scary to die.","The postmaster came in and humbly began asking his excellency to wait only two little hours, after which (come what might) he would give his excellency post-horses.

But the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible. And I,’ continued Pierre, ‘shot Dolokhov because I considered myself injured, and Louis XVI was executed because they considered him a criminal, and a year later they executed those who had executed him—also for some reason.

"Князь Андрей такое огромное количество людей считал презренными и ничтожными существами, так ему хотелось найти в другом живой идеал того совершенства, к которому он стремился, что он легко поверил, что в Сперанском он нашел этот идеал вполне разумного и добродетельного человека. Ежели бы Сперанский был из того же общества, из которого был князь Андрей, того же воспитания и нравственных привычек, то Болконский скоро бы нашел его слабые, человеческие, не геройские стороны, но теперь этот странный для него логический склад ума тем более внушал ему уважения, что он не вполне понимал его. Кроме того, Сперанский, потому ли что он оценил способности князя Андрея, или потому что нашел нужным приобресть его себе, Сперанский кокетничал перед князем Андреем своим беспристрастным, спокойным разумом и льстил князю Андрею той тонкой лестью, соединенной с самонадеянностью, которая состоит в молчаливом признавании своего собеседника с собою вместе единственным человеком, способным понимать всю глупость всех остальных, и разумность и глубину своих мыслей.","Prince Andrei considered such a huge number of people to be contemptible and insignificant creatures, he so wanted to find in another a living ideal of that perfection to which he aspired, that he easily believed that in Speransky he found this ideal of a completely reasonable and virtuous person.

In addition, Speransky, whether because he appreciated the abilities of Prince Andrei, or because he found it necessary to acquire him for himself, Speransky flirted with Prince Andrei with his impartial, calm mind and flattered Prince Andrei with that subtle flattery, combined with arrogance, which consists in tacit recognition his interlocutor with him along with the only person capable of understanding all the stupidity of everyone else, and the rationality and depth of his thoughts.","Prince Andrei considered such a vast number of people as contemptible and insignificant beings, he wanted so much to find in someone else the living ideal of that perfection for which he strove, that he easily believed that in Speransky he had found that ideal of the fully reasonable and virtuous man.

Besides that, Speransky, either because he appreciated Prince Andrei's ability, or because he found it necessary to acquire him for himself, flaunted his impartial, calm reason before Prince Andrei and flattered Prince Andrei with that subtle flattery, combined with self-assurance, which consists in silently acknowledging one's interlocutor and oneself as the only people capable of understanding all the stupidity of all the rest, and the intelligence and profundity of one's own thoughts.","To Bolkonsky so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant creatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that perfection towards which he strove, that he readily believed that in Speransky he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous man.

"После отъезда Марьи Дмитриевны, к Ростовым приехала модистка от мадам Шальме, и Наташа, затворив дверь в соседней с гостиной комнате, очень довольная развлечением, занялась примериваньем новых платьев. В то время как она, надев сметанный на живую нитку еще без рукавов лиф и загибая голову, гляделась в зеркало, как сидит спинка, она услыхала в гостиной оживленные звуки голоса отца и другого, женского голоса, который заставил ее покраснеть. Это был голос Элен. Не успела Наташа снять примериваемый лиф, как дверь отворилась и в комнату вошла графиня Безухая, сияющая добродушной и ласковой улыбкой, в темнолиловом, с высоким воротом, бархатном платье.","After Marya Dmitrievna's departure, a fashionista from Madame Chalmet came to the Rostovs, and Natasha, having closed the door in the room next to the living room, very pleased with the entertainment, began trying on new dresses.

"«Но в чем же я виноват? — спрашивал он. — В том, что ты женился не любя ее, в том, что ты обманул и себя и ее, — и ему живо представилась та минута после ужина у князя Василья, когда он сказал эти невыходившие из него слова: „Je vous aime“.

Even then I felt it,’ he thought. ‘I felt then that it was not so, that I had no right to do it. And so it turns out.’ He remembered his honeymoon, and blushed at the recollection.

The adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn: that a court-martial had been appointed, and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded, degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for."

"Первое время своего знакомства с Сперанским князь Андрей питал к нему страстное чувство восхищения, похожее на то, которое он когда-то испытывал к Бонапарте. То обстоятельство, что Сперанский был сын священника, которого можно было глупым людям, как это и делали многие, пошло презирать в качестве кутейника и поповича, заставляло князя Андрея особенно бережно обходиться с своим чувством к Сперанскому, и бессознательно усиливать его в самом себе.","At the first time of his acquaintance with Speransky, Prince Andrei had a passionate feeling of admiration for him, similar to the one he once felt for Bonaparte. The fact that Speransky was the son of a priest, whom stupid people could, as many did, began to be despised as a goofball and priest, forced Prince Andrei to be especially careful with his feeling for Speransky, and unconsciously strengthen it in himself.","During the first period of his acquaintance with Speransky, Prince Andrei had a passionate feeling of admiration for him, resembling what he used to feel for Bonaparte.

"«Я очень желаю, пишет прусской король Бонапарту, чтобы ваше величество были приняты в моем дворце самым приятнейшим для вас образом, и я с особенной заботливостью сделал для того все нужные распоряжения на сколько позволили обстоятельства. Весьма желаю, чтоб я достигнул цели». Прусские генералы щеголяют учтивостью перед французами и сдаются по первому требованию. Начальник гарнизона Глогау, с десятью тысячами, спрашивает у прусского короля, что ему делать, если ему придется сдаваться. Всё это положительно верно. Словом, мы думали внушить им страх только положением наших военных сил, но кончается тем, что мы вовлечены в войну, на нашей же границе и, главное, за прусского короля и заодно с ним. Всего у нас в избытке, недостает только маленькой штучки, а именно — главнокомандующего. Так как оказалось, что успехи Аустерлица могли бы быть положительнее, если б главнокомандующий был бы не так молод, то делается обзор осьмидесятилетних генералов, и между Прозоровским и Каменским выбирают последнего. Генерал приезжает к нам в кибитке по Суворовски, и его принимают с радостными и торжественными восклицаниями.","“I very much wish, writes the King of Prussia to Bonaparte, that your majesty be received in my palace in the most pleasant way for you, and with special care I made all the necessary orders for this, as far as circumstances allowed. I really hope that I reach my goal."" The Prussian generals flaunt courtesy to the French and surrender on demand. The head of the Glogau garrison, with ten thousand, asks the Prussian king what he should do if he has to surrender. All this is positively true. In a word, we thought to instill fear in them only by the position of our military forces, but it ends up with us being drawn into the war, on our own borders and, most importantly, for the Prussian king and at the same time with him. We have everything in abundance, only a small thing is missing, namely, the commander in chief. Since it turned out that Austerlitz's successes could have been more positive if the commander-in-chief were not so young, a review of the eighty-year-old generals is made, and the latter is chosen between Prozorovsky and Kamensky.

"Следующий после театра день Ростовы никуда не ездили и никто не приезжал к ним. Марья Дмитриевна о чем-то, скрывая от Наташи, переговаривалась с ее отцом.

Как только она начинала думать о нем, к воспоминанию о нем присоединялось воспоминание о старом князе, о княжне Марье и о последнем спектакле, и о Курагине. Ей опять представлялся вопрос, не виновата ли она, не нарушена ли уже ее верность князю Андрею, и опять она заставала себя до малейших подробностей воспоминающею каждое слово, каждый жест, каждый оттенок игры выражения на лице этого человека, умевшего возбудить в ней непонятное для нее и страшное чувство. На взгляд домашних, Наташа казалась оживленнее обыкновенного, но она далеко была не так спокойна и счастлива, как была прежде.","The next day after the theater, the Rostovs did not go anywhere and no one came to visit them. Marya Dmitrievna, hiding from Natasha, was talking to her father about something. Natasha guessed that they were talking about the old prince and inventing something, and she was worried and offended by this. She waited every minute for Prince Andrei, and twice that day sent the janitor to Vzdvizhenka to find out if he had arrived. He didn't come. It was now harder for her than the first days of her arrival. Her impatience and sadness for him were joined by an unpleasant recollection of a meeting with Princess Marya and the old prince, and fear and anxiety, for which she did not know the reason. It seemed to her that either he would never come, or that something would happen to her before he arrived. She could not, as before, calmly and for a long time, alone with herself, think about him. As soon as she began to think about him, the memory of him was joined by the memory of the old prince, of Princess Marya and of the last performance, and of Kuragin. She again presented herself with the question of whether she was to blame, whether her loyalty to Prince Andrei had already been violated, and again she found herself remembering every word, every gesture, every shade of the play of expression on the face of this man, who knew how to arouse in her incomprehensible for her and a terrible feeling. In the eyes of her family, Natasha seemed livelier than usual, but she was far from being as calm and happy as she had been before.","The day after the theater, the Rostovs did not go anywhere, and no one came to them. Marya Dmitrievna discussed something with Natasha's father, concealing it from her. Natasha could guess that they were talking about the old prince, working something out, and that disturbed and offended her. She was expecting Prince Andrei any moment and had sent the yard porter to Vzdvizhenka twice that day to find out if he had come. He had not. It was now harder for her than in the first days after her arrival. To her impatience and sadness were added the unpleasant memory of meeting Princess Marya and the old prince, and a fear and uneasiness of which she did not know the cause. She kept fancying either that he would never come or that something would happen to her before he came. She could not, as before, think about him calmly and for a long time, alone with herself. As soon as she began thinking about him, to her memory of him were added the memories of the old prince, of Princess Marya, of last night's performance, and of Kuragin. She again faced the question of whether she was to blame, whether she had already broken faith with Prince Andrei, and she again found herself recalling in the minutest detail every word, every gesture, every shade of expression that had played on the face of this man, who was able to arouse in her an incomprehensible and frightening feeling. In the eyes of those around her, Natasha seemed more animated than usual, but she was far from being as calm and happy as she had been before.","THE day after the opera the Rostovs went nowhere and nobody came to see them. Marya Dmitrievna talked to the count about something which they concealed from Natasha. Natasha guessed they were talking about the old prince and planning something, and this disquieted and offended her. She was expecting Prince Andrei any moment, and twice that day sent a manservant to the Vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he had come. He had not arrived. She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow. To her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant recollection of her interview with Princess Marya and the old prince, and a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause. She continually fancied that either he would never come, or that something would happen to her before he came. She could no longer think of him by herself calmly and continuously as she had done before. As soon as she began to think of him, the recollection of the old prince, of Princess Marya, of the theatre, and of Kuragin, mingled with her thoughts. The question again presented itself whether she was not guilty, whether she had not already broken faith with Prince Andrei, and again she found herself recalling to the minutest detail, every word, every gesture, and every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying feeling. To the family Natasha seemed livelier than usual, but she was far less tranquil and happy than before."

"— Да, это затруднительно, понеже образование весьма мало распространено, но… — Граф Кочубей не договорил, он поднялся и, взяв за руку князя Андрея, пошел навстречу входящему высокому, лысому, белокурому человеку, лет сорока, с большим открытым лбом и необычайной, странной белизной продолговатого лица. На вошедшем был синий фрак, крест на шее и звезда на левой стороне груди. Это был Сперанский. Князь Андрей тотчас узнал его и в душе его что-то дрогнуло, как это бывает в важные минуты жизни. Было ли это уважение, зависть, ожидание — он не знал. Вся фигура Сперанского имела особенный тип, по которому сейчас можно было узнать его. Ни у кого из того общества, в котором жил князь Андрей, он не видал этого спокойствия и самоуверенности неловких и тупых движений, ни у кого он не видал такого твердого и вместе мягкого взгляда полузакрытых и несколько влажных глаз, не видал такой твердости ничего незначащей улыбки, такого тонкого, ровного, тихого голоса, и, главное, такой нежной белизны лица и особенно рук, несколько широких, но необыкновенно пухлых, нежных и белых. Такую белизну и нежность лица князь Андрей видал только у солдат, долго пробывших в госпитале. Это был Сперанский, государственный секретарь, докладчик государя и спутник его в Эрфурте, где он не раз виделся и говорил с Наполеоном.","“Yes, it’s difficult, since education is very little widespread, but ...” Count Kochubey did not finish, he got up and, taking Prince Andrei by the hand, went towards the incoming tall, bald, blond man, about forty, with a large open forehead and an extraordinary, strange whiteness of an oblong face. The newcomer was wearing a blue tailcoat, a cross around his neck and a star on the left side of his chest. It was Speransky. Prince Andrei immediately recognized him and something trembled in his soul, as happens at important moments in life. Whether it was respect, envy, expectation, he did not know. The whole figure of Speransky had a special type, by which one could now recognize him. In no one of the society in which Prince Andrei lived did he see this calmness and self-confidence of awkward and stupid movements, in no one did he see such a firm and at the same time soft look of half-closed and somewhat moist eyes, he did not see such a firmness of an insignificant smile , such a thin, even, quiet voice, and, most importantly, such a delicate whiteness of the face and especially the hands, somewhat wide, but unusually plump, tender and white. Such a whiteness and tenderness of the face, Prince Andrei saw only among soldiers who had been in the hospital for a long time. It was Speransky, the state secretary, the speaker of the sovereign and his companion in Erfurt, where he met and spoke with Napoleon more than once.","“Yes, that makes it difficult, since education is not very widespread, but...” Count Kochubey did not finish, stood up, and, taking Prince Andrei by the arm, went to meet a tall, balding, fair-haired man of about forty, with a large, open forehead and an elongated face of an unusual, strange whiteness. The entering man was wearing a dark blue tailcoat, a cross on his neck, and a star on the left side of his chest. It was Speransky. Prince Andrei recognized him at once, and something in his soul shook, as happens at important moments of life. Whether it was respect, envy, or expectation—he did not know. Speransky's entire figure was of a special type, by which he could be recognized at once. In no one of the society in which Prince Andrei lived had he seen this calm and self-assurance of clumsy and obtuse movements, in no one had he seen such a firm and at the same time soft gaze of half-closed and slightly moist eyes, such firmness of a totally meaningless smile, such a thin, smooth, soft voice, and, above all, such a tender whiteness of the face and especially of the hands, somewhat broad, but extraordinarily plump, tender, and white. Such whiteness and tenderness of face Prince Andrei had seen only in soldiers who had spent a long time in the hospital. This was Speransky, secretary of state, counselor to the sovereign, and his companion at Erfurt, where he had seen and spoken with Napoleon more than once.","‘Yes, that’s a difficulty, as education is not at all general, but …’ Count Kochubey did not finish. He rose, took Prince Andrei by the arm, and went to meet a tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a large open forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness, who was just entering. The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with a cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast. It was Speransky. Prince Andrei recognized him at once, and felt a throb within him, as happens at critical moments of life. Whether it was from respect, envy, or anticipation, he did not know. Speransky’s whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable. In the society in which Prince Andrei lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and self-assurance; he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those half-closed, rather humid eyes, or so firm a smile that expressed nothing; nor had he heard such a refined, smooth, soft voice; above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or hands—hands which were broad, but very plump, soft, and white. Such whiteness and softness Prince Andrei had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long in hospital. This was Speransky, Secretary of State, reporter to the Emperor and his companion at Erfurt, where he had more than once met and talked with Napoleon."

"— Ежели есть Бог и есть будущая жизнь, то есть истина, есть добродетель; и высшее счастье человека состоит в том, чтобы стремиться к достижению их. Надо жить, надо любить, надо верить, — говорил Пьер, — что живем не нынче только на этом клочке земли, а жили и будем жить вечно там во всем (он указал на небо). Князь Андрей стоял, облокотившись на перила парома и, слушая Пьера, не спуская глаз, смотрел на красный отблеск солнца по синеющему разливу. Пьер замолк. Было совершенно тихо. Паром давно пристал, и только волны теченья с слабым звуком ударялись о дно парома. Князю Андрею казалось, что это полосканье волн к словам Пьера приговаривало: «правда, верь этому».","- If there is a God and there is a future life, then there is truth, there is virtue; and the highest happiness of man is to strive to achieve them. We must live, we must love, we must believe, - said Pierre, - that we do not live today only on this piece of land, but we have lived and will live forever there in everything (he pointed to the sky). Prince Andrei stood leaning on the railing of the ferry and, listening to Pierre, without taking his eyes off, looked at the red reflection of the sun over the blue flood. Pierre is silent. It was completely quiet. The ferry had long landed, and only the waves of the current with a faint sound hit the bottom of the ferry. It seemed to Prince Andrei that this rinsing of the waves was saying to Pierre's words: ""True, believe this.""","“If there is God and if there is a future life, then there is truth, there is virtue; and man's highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must live, we must love, we must believe,” said Pierre, “that we do not live only today on this scrap of earth, but have lived and will live eternally there, in the all” (he pointed to the sky). Prince Andrei stood with his elbow resting on the rail of the ferry, and, listening to Pierre, did not take his eyes off the red gleam of the sun on the blue floodwaters. Pierre fell silent. It was completely still. The ferry had long been moored, and only the waves of the current lapped with a faint sound against the ferry's bottom. It seemed to Prince Andrei that this splash of waves made a refrain to Pierre's words, saying: “It's true, believe it.”","‘If there is a God and future life there is truth and good, and man’s highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must live, we must love, and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrap of earth but have lived and shall live for ever, there, in the Whole,’ said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky. Prince Andrei stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to Pierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the sun gleaming on the blue waters. There was perfect stillness. Pierre became silent. The raft had long since stopped, and only the waves of the current beat softly against it below. Prince Andrei felt as if the sound of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierre’s words, whispering: ‘It is true, believe it.’"

Экипажи отъезжали, и всё подъезжали новые с красными лакеями и с лакеями в перьях на шляпах. Из карет выходили мужчины в мундирах, звездах и лентах; дамы в атласе и горностаях осторожно сходили по шумно откладываемым подножкам, и торопливо и беззвучно проходили по сукну подъезда.","On the Promenade des Anglais, the famous house of a nobleman shone with countless lights of illumination.

"— Nathalie, vos cheveux, [Натали, твои волосы, ] — прошептала Соня. Капельдинер учтиво и поспешно проскользнул перед дамами и отворил дверь ложи. Музыка ярче стала слышна в дверь, блеснули освещенные ряды лож с обнаженными плечами и руками дам, и шумящий и блестящий мундирами партер. Дама, входившая в соседний бенуар, оглянула Наташу женским, завистливым взглядом. Занавесь еще не поднималась и играли увертюру. Наташа, оправляя платье, прошла вместе с Соней и села, оглядывая освещенные ряды противуположных лож. Давно не испытанное ею ощущение того, что сотни глаз смотрят на ее обнаженные руки и шею, вдруг и приятно и неприятно охватило ее, вызывая целый рой соответствующих этому ощущению воспоминаний, желаний и волнений.","- Nathalie, vos cheveux, [Natalie, your hair,] - Sonya whispered.

The lady, entering the neighboring bin, looked around Natasha with a feminine, envious look. The curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being played. Natasha, straightening her dress, walked along with Sonya and sat down, looking around the illuminated rows of opposite boxes.

Семен вздохнул и нагнулся, чтоб оправить сворку, в которой запутался молодой кобель; граф тоже вздохнул и, заметив в своей руке табакерку, открыл ее и достал щепоть. «Назад!» крикнул Семен на кобеля, который выступил за опушку. Граф вздрогнул и уронил табакерку. Настасья Ивановна слез и стал поднимать ее.","After listening for a few seconds in silence, the count and his stirrups were convinced that the hounds had split into two flocks: one large one, roaring especially fervently, began to move away, the other part of the flock rushed along the forest past the count, and with this flock Danila's hooting was heard. Both of these ruts merged, shimmered, but both moved away. Semyon sighed and bent down to straighten the bundle in which the young male got entangled; the count also sighed, and noticing the snuff-box in his hand, he opened it and took out a pinch.

Nastasya Ivanovna got down and began to lift her up.","Listening silently for a few seconds, the count and his groom realized that the hounds had broken up into two packs: one, a big one, baying with particular fervor, began to move away; the other part of the pack raced through the woods, past the count, and in this pack Danilo's hallooing could be heard. These two chases merged, alternated, but both were moving away. Semyon sighed and bent down to straighten the leash in which a young dog had become entangled. The count also sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in his hand, opened it and took a pinch. “Back!” Semyon shouted at a dog that had stepped out of the bushes. The count gave a start and dropped the snuffbox.

The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again, but both were becoming more distant. Semyon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had entangled, the count too sighed, and noticing the snuff-box in his hand opened it and took a pinch. ‘Back!’ cried Semyon to a borzoi that was pushing forward out of the wood.

Быть принятым в салоне графини Безуховой считалось дипломом ума; молодые люди прочитывали книги перед вечером Элен, чтобы было о чем говорить в ее салоне, и секретари посольства, и даже посланники, поверяли ей дипломатические тайны, так что Элен была сила в некотором роде. Пьер, который знал, что она была очень глупа, с странным чувством недоуменья и страха иногда присутствовал на ее вечерах и обедах, где говорилось о политике, поэзии и философии. На этих вечерах он испытывал чувство подобное тому, которое должен испытывать фокусник, ожидая всякий раз, что вот-вот обман его откроется. Но оттого ли, что для ведения такого салона именно нужна была глупость, или потому что сами обманываемые находили удовольствие в этом обмане, обман не открывался, и репутация d'une femme charmante et spirituelle так непоколебимо утвердилась за Еленой Васильевной Безуховой, что она могла говорить самые большие пошлости и глупости, и всё-таки все восхищались каждым ее словом и отыскивали в нем глубокий смысл, которого она сама и не подозревала.","""d'une femme charmante, aussi spirituelle, que belle.""

The officer's audience went on for a long time. Suddenly, the rumbles of an unpleasant voice were heard from behind the door, and a pale officer, with trembling lips, came out of there, and clutching his head, went through the reception room.","But as soon as the door opened, all the faces instantly expressed only one thing—fear.

"Ежели бы Наполеон не оскорбился требованием отступить за Вислу и не велел наступать войскам, не было бы войны; но ежели бы все сержанты не пожелали поступить на вторичную службу, тоже войны не могло бы быть. Тоже не могло бы быть войны, ежели бы не было интриг Англии, и не было бы принца Ольденбургского и чувства оскорбления в Александре, и не было бы самодержавной власти в России, и не было бы французской революции и последовавших диктаторства и империи, и всего того, что произвело французскую революцию, и так далее. Без одной из этих причин ничего не могло бы быть. Стало быть, причины эти все — миллиарды причин — совпали для того, чтобы произвести то, что было. И, следовательно, ничто не было исключительной причиной события, а событие должно было совершиться только потому, что оно должно было совершиться. Должны были миллионы людей, отрекшись от своих человеческих чувств и своего разума, идти на Восток с Запада и убивать себе подобных, точно так же, как несколько веков тому назад с Востока на Запад шли толпы людей, убивая себе подобных.","If Napoleon had not been offended by the demand to retreat beyond the Vistula and had not ordered the troops to advance, there would have been no war; but if all the sergeants did not wish to enter the secondary service, there could also be no war. There could also be no war if there were no intrigues of England, and there would be no Prince of Oldenburg and a feeling of insult in Alexander, and there would be no autocratic power in Russia, and there would be no French revolution and the subsequent dictatorship and empire, and all that that produced the French Revolution, and so on. Without one of these reasons, nothing could have happened. Therefore, all these causes - billions of reasons - coincided in order to produce what was. And therefore, nothing was the exclusive cause of the event, and the event had to happen only because it had to happen. Millions of people, having renounced their human feelings and their minds, had to go to the East from the West and kill their own kind, just as several centuries ago crowds of people went from East to West, killing their own kind.","If Napoleon had not been insulted by the demand to withdraw beyond the Vistula, and had not ordered his troops to advance, there would have been no war; but if all the sergeants had been unwilling to enlist for a second tour of duty, there also could have been no war. There also could have been no war if there had been no intrigues of the English, and if there had been no prince of Oldenburg and insulted feelings in Alexander, and if there had been no autocratic power in Russia, and if there had been no French revolution and subsequent dictatorship and empire, and all that produced the French revolution, and so on. Without any one of these causes, nothing could have happened. Therefore, all these causes—billions of causes—coincided so as to bring about what happened. And consequently none of them was the exclusive cause of the event, but the event had to take place simply because it had to take place. Millions of men, renouncing their human feelings and their reason, had to go from west to east and kill their own kind, just as, several centuries earlier, hordes of men had gone from east to west, killing their own kind.","Had Napoleon not taken offence at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war. Nor could there have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have happened. So all these causes—myriads of causes—coincided to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west slaying their fellows."

Пьер, за эти два года, вследствие своего постоянного сосредоточенного занятия невещественными интересами и искреннего презрения ко всему остальному, усвоил себе в неинтересовавшем его обществе жены тот тон равнодушия, небрежности и благосклонности ко всем, который не приобретается искусственно и который потому-то и внушает невольное уважение. Он входил в гостиную своей жены как в театр, со всеми был знаком, всем был одинаково рад и ко всем был одинаково равнодушен. Иногда он вступал в разговор, интересовавший его, и тогда, без соображений о том, были ли тут или нет les messieurs de l'ambassade [служащие при посольстве], шамкая говорил свои мнения, которые иногда были совершенно не в тоне настоящей минуты.

During these two years, Pierre, as a result of his constant concentrated occupation with immaterial interests and sincere contempt for everything else, acquired in his wife’s company that did not interest him that tone of indifference, carelessness and favor to everyone, which is not acquired artificially and which therefore inspires involuntary respect. He entered his wife's drawing room like a theater, knew everyone, was equally pleased with everyone, and was equally indifferent to everyone. Sometimes he entered into a conversation that interested him, and then, without thinking about whether les messieurs de l'ambassade [employees at the embassy] were present or not, mumbled his opinions, which sometimes were completely out of tune with the present moment.

They all sang something. When they had finished their song the girl in white went up to the prompter’s box, and a man with tight silk trousers over his stout legs, and holding a plume and a dagger, went up to her and began singing, waving his arms about."
"— Что прикажете, ваше сиятельство? — спросил протодиаконский, охриплый от порсканья бас, и два черные блестящие глаза взглянули исподлобья на замолчавшего барина. «Что, или не выдержишь?» как будто сказали эти два глаза.","“What would you like, your excellency?” asked the protodeacon's bass voice, hoarse with chirping, and two shiny black eyes looked from under their brows at the silent gentleman.

"Волк приостановил бег, неловко, как больной жабой, повернул свою лобастую голову к собакам, и также мягко переваливаясь прыгнул раз, другой и, мотнув поленом (хвостом), скрылся в опушку. В ту же минуту из противоположной опушки с ревом, похожим на плач, растерянно выскочила одна, другая, третья гончая, и вся стая понеслась по полю, по тому самому месту, где пролез (пробежал) волк. Вслед за гончими расступились кусты орешника и показалась бурая, почерневшая от поту лошадь Данилы. На длинной спине ее комочком, валясь вперед, сидел Данила без шапки с седыми, встрепанными волосами над красным, потным лицом.","The wolf stopped running, clumsily, like a sick toad, turned his broad-fronted head towards the dogs, and, also waddling softly, jumped once, twice, and, waving a log (tail), disappeared into the forest. At the same moment, one, another, a third hound jumped out of the opposite edge with a roar like a cry, and the whole flock rushed across the field, along the very place where the wolf crawled (ran). Following the hounds, the hazel bushes parted and Danila's brown horse, blackened with sweat, appeared. On her long back, in a lump, leaning forward, sat Danila without a hat, with gray, disheveled hair over a red, sweaty face.","The wolf slowed his flight, turned his big-browed head towards the dogs awkwardly, as if suffering from angina, and, swaying just as softly, leaped once, twice, and, with a wag of his tail, disappeared into the bushes. At that same moment, from the bushes opposite, with a baying that sounded like a lament, perplexedly leaped one hound, a second, a third, and the whole pack raced across the field to the same place where the wolf had gone through. After the hounds, the hazel bushes parted, and Danilo's brown horse appeared, dark with sweat. On its long back, in a little lump, thrown forward, sat Danilo, hat-less, his gray hair tousled above his red, sweaty face.","The wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead towards the dogs awkwardly, like a man suffering from the quinsy, and still slightly swaying from side to side, gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail disappeared into the skirt of the wood. At the same instant, with a cry like a wail, first one hound, then another, and then another, sprang out helter-skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across the field towards the very spot where the wolf had disappeared. The hazel bushes parted behind the hounds, and Danilo’s chestnut horse appeared, dark with sweat. On its long back sat Danilo, hunched forward, capless, his dishevelled grey hair hanging over his flushed, perspiring face."
"Старый кобель, с своими мотавшимися на ляжках клоками, благодаря происшедшей остановке, перерезывая дорогу волку, был уже в пяти шагах от него. Как будто почувствовав опасность, волк покосился на Карая, еще дальше спрятав полено (хвост) между ног и наддал скоку. Но тут — Николай видел только, что что-то сделалось с Караем — он мгновенно очутился на волке и с ним вместе повалился кубарем в водомоину, которая была перед ними.","The old dog, with his tufts dangling on his haunches, thanks to the stop that had taken place, cutting the way for the wolf, was already five paces away from him. As if sensing danger, the wolf glanced sideways at Karay, hiding the log (tail) between his legs even further and gave it a lope. But then - Nikolai only saw that something had happened to Karai - he instantly found himself on a wolf and, together with him, fell head over heels into the waterhole that was in front of them.","Thanks to the delay, the old dog, his matted fur hanging from his haunches, headed off the wolf, and was now within five paces of him. The wolf, as if sensing the danger, gave Karai a sidelong glance, tucked his tail still further between his legs, and increased his pace. But here—Nikolai only saw that something happened with Karai—he was instantly on top of the wolf and rolled head over heels with him into a ditch in front of them.","Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf’s path, the old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of it.

But here Nikolai only saw that something happened to Karay—the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf, and they rolled together down into a gully just in front of them."

"— Суди меня там Бог и великий государь! — сказал Денисов, выходя; и Ростов услыхал, как за балаганом зашлепали по грязи ноги нескольких лошадей. Ростов не позаботился даже узнать, куда поехал Денисов. Угревшись в своем угле, он заснул и перед вечером только вышел из балагана. Денисов еще не возвращался. Вечер разгулялся; около соседней землянки два офицера с юнкером играли в свайку, с смехом засаживая редьки в рыхлую грязную землю. Ростов присоединился к ним. В середине игры офицеры увидали подъезжавшие к ним повозки: человек 15 гусар на худых лошадях следовали за ними. Повозки, конвоируемые гусарами, подъехали к коновязям, и толпа гусар окружила их.","- Judge me there, God and the great sovereign! said Denisov, going out; and Rostov heard the feet of several horses splashing through the mud behind the booth.

Evening cleared up; near a neighboring dugout, two officers and a cadet were playing pile, laughingly planting radishes in the loose, dirty earth. Rostov joined them.

"В то время как государь подъезжал к одному флангу баталионов, сделавших на караул, к противоположному флангу подскакивала другая толпа всадников и впереди их Ростов узнал Наполеона.

Батальоны закричали: Ура и Vive l'Empereur! [Да здравствует Император!] Наполеон что-то сказал Александру. Оба императора слезли с лошадей и взяли друг друга за руки.

Riding up to Alexander, he raised his hat, and with this movement, the cavalry eye of Rostov could not fail to notice that Napoleon was badly and not firmly sitting on his horse. The battalions shouted: Hooray and Vive l'Empereur! [Long live the Emperor!] Napoleon said something to Alexander. Both emperors dismounted from their horses and took each other's hands.

What these accounts of everything were, Nikolai knew even less than Mitenka, who had come in fear and bewilderment. The conversation and accounting of Mitenka did not last long.

"— Да, — сказал князь Андрей, — отец не хотел, чтобы я пользовался этим правом; я начал службу с нижних чинов.","“Yes,” said Prince Andrei, “father did not want me to use this right; I started my service from the lower ranks.","“Yes,” said Prince Andrei, “my father didn't want me to take advantage of that right; I started service in the lower ranks.”","‘No,’ said Prince Andrei, ‘my father did not wish me to take advantage of the privilege. I began the service from the lower grade.’"
"— Ах, отец, что говоришь! — с ужасом сказала Пелагеюшка, за защитой обращаясь к княжне Марье.","“Ah, father, what are you talking about!” - Pelageyushka said with horror, turning to Princess Marya for protection.","“Ah, good sir, what are you saying!” Pelageyushka said in horror, turning to Princess Marya for defense.","‘Oh, master, what are you saying?’ exclaimed the horrified Pelageyushka, turning to Princess Marya for support."
— Разве можно это сравнивать?… — сказал Пьер. Князь Андрей перебил его. Он резко закричал:,“How can this be compared? ...” said Pierre. Prince Andrew interrupted him. He shouted sharply:,“But can this be compared ... ?” said Pierre. Prince Andrei interrupted him. He cried sharply:,"‘But can this be compared …?’ said Pierre. Prince Andrei interrupted him, and cried sharply:"
"— Я так рада, так рада! Я уж сердилась на тебя. Я тебе не говорила, но ты дурно с ней поступал. Это такое сердце, Nicolas. Как я рада! Я бываю гадкая, но мне совестно было быть одной счастливой без Сони, — продолжала Наташа. — Теперь я так рада, ну, беги к ней.","- I'm so glad, so glad! I've been angry with you. I didn't tell you, but you did bad things to her. It's such a heart, Nicolas. I am so glad! I can be ugly, but I was ashamed to be alone happy without Sonya, Natasha continued. “Now I’m so glad, well, run to her.”","“I'm so glad, so glad! I was getting angry with you. I didn't tell you, but you behaved badly towards her. She's such a heart, Nicolas, I'm so glad! I can be nasty, but I was ashamed to be happy alone, without Sonya,” Natasha went on. “Now I'm so glad! Well, run to her.”","‘I am so glad, so glad! I was starting to get annoyed with you. I didn’t tell you, but you have been treating her badly. What a heart she has, Nicolas! I am horrid sometimes but I was ashamed to be happy while Sonya was not,’ continued Natasha. ‘Now I am so glad! Well, run back to her.’"
"— Ну, ну, говорите, я очень рад, — говорил Пьер, и действительно лицо его изменилось, морщина разгладилась, и он радостно слушал князя Андрея. Князь Андрей казался и был совсем другим, новым человеком. Где была его тоска, его презрение к жизни, его разочарованность? Пьер был единственный человек, перед которым он решался высказаться; но зато он ему высказывал всё, что у него было на душе. То он легко и смело делал планы на продолжительное будущее, говорил о том, как он не может пожертвовать своим счастьем для каприза своего отца, как он заставит отца согласиться на этот брак и полюбить ее или обойдется без его согласия, то он удивлялся, как на что-то странное, чуждое, от него независящее, на то чувство, которое владело им.","“Well, well, say, I’m very glad,” Pierre said, and indeed his face changed, the wrinkle smoothed out, and he joyfully listened to Prince Andrei. Prince Andrei seemed and was a completely different, new person. Where was his anguish, his contempt for life, his disappointment? Pierre was the only person before whom he dared to speak out; but on the other hand, he told him everything that was in his soul. Either he easily and boldly made plans for a long future, talked about how he could not sacrifice his happiness for the whim of his father, how he would force his father to agree to this marriage and love her or do without his consent, then he was surprised how on something strange, alien, independent of him, on the feeling that possessed him.","“Well, well, talk, I'm very glad,” said Pierre, and indeed his face changed, the furrow smoothed out, and he listened joyfully to Prince Andrei. Prince Andrei seemed and was quite a different, new man. Where was his anguish, his contempt for life, his disillusionment? Pierre was the only man before whom he would venture to speak himself out; but then he spoke everything that was in his heart. First he lightly and boldly made plans far into the future, saying how he could not sacrifice his happiness to his father's whim, how he would make his father agree to this marriage and love her, or else he would do without his consent; then he was astonished, as at something strange, alien, independent of him, at the feeling that possessed him.","‘Well, go on, go on. I am very glad,’ said Pierre, and his face really changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince Andrei. Prince Andrei seemed, and really was, quite a different, quite a new man. Where was his spleen, his contempt for life, his disillusionment? Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind to speak openly; and to him he told all that was in his soul. Now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future, said he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his father’s caprice, and spoke of how he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her, or would do without his consent; then he marvelled at the feeling that had mastered him, as at something strange, apart from and independent of himself."
"Запись дошла до рокового числа сорока трех тысяч. Ростов приготовил карту, которая должна была итти углом от трех тысяч рублей, только что данных ему, когда Долохов, стукнув колодой, отложил ее и, взяв мел, начал быстро своим четким, крепким почерком, ломая мелок, подводить итог записи Ростова.","The record reached the fateful number of forty-three thousand. Rostov prepared a card, which was supposed to go at an angle from the three thousand rubles that had just been given to him, when Dolokhov, knocking with a deck, put it aside and, taking the chalk, began quickly with his clear, strong handwriting, breaking the chalk, to sum up Rostov's note.","The score reached the fateful number of forty-three thousand. Rostov prepared a card which was to go corners on the three thousand just given him, when Dolokhov tapped the deck on the table, set it aside, and, taking the chalk, quickly began in his clear, strong hand, breaking the piece of chalk, to add up Rostov's score.","The score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three thousand. Rostov had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he meant to double the three thousand just put down to his score, when Dolokhov, slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began rapidly adding up the total of Rostov’s debt, breaking the chalk as he marked the figures in his clear, bold hand."

"— Ты об чем думал теперь, Николенька? — спросила Наташа. — Они любили это спрашивать друг у друга.","""What are you thinking now, Nikolenka?"" Natasha asked. They liked to ask each other that.","“What are you thinking about now, Nikolenka?” asked Natasha. They liked asking each other that.","‘What were you thinking about just now, Nikolushka?’ inquired Natasha. They were fond of asking one another that question. ‘I?’"
"Отъехав с версту, навстречу Ростовской охоте из тумана показалось еще пять всадников с собаками. Впереди ехал свежий, красивый старик с большими седыми усами.","Having driven a mile away, five more riders with dogs appeared out of the fog towards the Rostov hunt. Ahead rode a fresh, handsome old man with a large gray mustache.","They had not yet ridden a mile when the Rostov hunt was met by another five riders with dogs emerging from the mist. At their head rode a fresh, handsome old man with big gray mustaches.","When they had gone about a verst, five more riders with dogs appeared out of the mist, approaching the Rostovs. In front rode a fresh-looking handsome old man with a large grey moustache."
"Человек пять, больших и малых, дворовых мужчин выбежало на парадное крыльцо встречать барина. Десятки женщин, старых, больших и малых, высунулись с заднего крыльца смотреть на подъезжавших охотников. Присутствие Наташи, женщины, барыни верхом, довело любопытство дворовых дядюшки до тех пределов, что многие, не стесняясь ее присутствием, подходили к ней, заглядывали ей в глаза и при ней делали о ней свои замечания, как о показываемом чуде, которое не человек, и не может слышать и понимать, что говорят о нем.","Five people, large and small, yard men ran out to the front porch to meet the master. Dozens of women, old, big and small, leaned out from the back porch to look at the approaching hunters. The presence of Natasha, a woman, a lady on horseback, brought the curiosity of the yard uncle to such limits that many, not embarrassed by her presence, approached her, looked into her eyes and made their remarks about her, as if they were showing a miracle that is not a person, and cannot hear and understand what is being said about him.","Some five men servants, big and small, ran out to the front porch to meet the master. Dozens of women, old, big and little, stuck themselves out from the back porch to look at the arriving hunters.

A score of women serfs old and young, as well as children, popped out from the back entrance to have a look at the hunters who were arriving.

"Он молча прошел от одного угла комнаты до другого и опять остановился против Балашева. Лицо его как будто окаменело в своем строгом выражении, и левая нога дрожала еще быстрее, чем прежде. Это дрожанье левой икры Наполеон знал за собой.

"В сенях пахло свежими яблоками, и висели волчьи и лисьи шкуры. Через переднюю дядюшка провел своих гостей в маленькую залу с складным столом и красными стульями, потом в гостиную с березовым круглым столом и диваном, потом в кабинет с оборванным диваном, истасканным ковром и с портретами Суворова, отца и матери хозяина и его самого в военном мундире. В кабинете слышался сильный запах табаку и собак. В кабинете дядюшка попросил гостей сесть и расположиться как дома, а сам вышел. Ругай с невычистившейся спиной вошел в кабинет и лег на диван, обчищая себя языком и зубами. Из кабинета шел коридор, в котором виднелись ширмы с прорванными занавесками. Из-за ширм слышался женский смех и шопот. Наташа, Николай и Петя разделись и сели на диван. Петя облокотился на руку и тотчас же заснул; Наташа и Николай сидели молча. Лица их горели, они были очень голодны и очень веселы. Они поглядели друг на друга (после охоты, в комнате, Николай уже не считал нужным выказывать свое мужское превосходство перед своей сестрой); Наташа подмигнула брату и оба удерживались недолго и звонко расхохотались, не успев еще придумать предлога для своего смеха.","The hallway smelled of fresh apples, and wolf and fox skins hung. Through the front uncle led his guests into a small hall with a folding table and red chairs, then into a living room with a round birch table and a sofa, then into an office with a tattered sofa, a worn-out carpet and with portraits of Suvorov, the father and mother of the host and himself in a military uniform. . There was a strong smell of tobacco and dogs in the office. In the office, the uncle asked the guests to sit down and make themselves at home, and he left. The scold, with his back uncleaned, entered the office and lay down on the sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth. From the office there was a corridor in which screens with torn curtains could be seen. Women's laughter and whispers could be heard from behind the screens. Natasha, Nikolai and Petya undressed and sat on the sofa. Petya leaned on his arm and immediately fell asleep; Natasha and Nikolai sat in silence. Their faces were on fire, they were very hungry and very cheerful. They looked at each other (after the hunt, in the room, Nikolai no longer considered it necessary to show his male superiority to his sister); Natasha winked at her brother, and both did not hold back for long and burst out laughing loudly, not having yet had time to think of an excuse for their laughter.","The entryway smelled of fresh apples and was hung with wolf and fox pelts.

"12-го числа рано утром он вышел из палатки, раскинутой в этот день на крутом левом берегу Немана, и смотрел в зрительную трубу на выплывающие из Вильковисского леса потоки своих войск, разливающихся по трем мостам, наведенным на Немане. Войска знали о присутствии императора, искали его глазами, и, когда находили на горе перед палаткой отделившуюся от свиты фигуру в сюртуке и шляпе, они кидали вверх шапки, кричали: «Vive l'Empereur! [Да здравствует император!] — и одни за другими, не истощаясь, вытекали, всё вытекали из огромного, скрывавшего их доселе леса и, расстрояясь, по трем мостам переходили на ту сторону.","On the 12th, early in the morning, he left the tent that had been pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Neman, and looked through the telescope at the streams of his troops emerging from the Vilkovis forest, spilling over three bridges built on the Neman.

[Long live the emperor!] — and one after the other, without exhaustion, flowed out, all flowed out of the huge forest that had hidden them hitherto, and, frustrated, crossed over three bridges to the other side.","Early in the morning of the twelfth, he came out of the tent, pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niémen, and watched through a field glass the streams of his troops flowing out of the Wilkowiski forest and pouring over the three bridges thrown across the Niémen.

The troops, knowing of the Emperor’s presence, were on the look-out for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on the hill, they threw up their caps and shouted: ‘Vive l’Empereur!’1 and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest that had concealed them and, separating, flowed on and on by the three bridges to the other side."
"— А как он смотрит теперь на это дело? — спросил Пьер, под он разумея старого князя. Княжна Марья покачала головой.","How does he view the matter now? asked Pierre, by which he meant the old prince.

"Долохов часто обедал у Ростовых, никогда не пропускал спектакля, где они были, и бывал на балах adolescentes [подростков] у Иогеля, где всегда бывали Ростовы.

"— Отчего же несправедливо? — повторил князь Андрей; то, что справедливо и несправедливо — не дано судить людям. Люди вечно заблуждались и будут заблуждаться, и ни в чем больше, как в том, что они считают справедливым и несправедливым.","Why is it unfair? repeated Prince Andrei; what is just and unjust is not given to people to judge.

"Для него было не ново убеждение в том, что присутствие его на всех концах мира, от Африки до степей Московии, одинаково поражает и повергает людей в безумие самозабвения. Он велел подать себе лошадь и поехал в свою стоянку.","For him, the conviction was not new that his presence at all ends of the world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy, equally amazes and plunges people into the madness of self-forgetfulness.

"После деревни и в том серьезном настроении, в котором находилась Наташа, всё это было дико и удивительно ей. Она не могла следить за ходом оперы, не могла даже слышать музыку: она видела только крашеные картоны и странно-наряженных мужчин и женщин, при ярком свете странно двигавшихся, говоривших и певших; она знала, что всё это должно было представлять, но всё это было так вычурно-фальшиво и ненатурально, что ей становилось то совестно за актеров, то смешно на них. Она оглядывалась вокруг себя, на лица зрителей, отыскивая в них то же чувство насмешки и недоумения, которое было в ней; но все лица были внимательны к тому, что происходило на сцене и выражали притворное, как казалось Наташе, восхищение. «Должно быть это так надобно!» думала Наташа. Она попеременно оглядывалась то на эти ряды припомаженных голов в партере, то на оголенных женщин в ложах, в особенности на свою соседку Элен, которая, совершенно раздетая, с тихой и спокойной улыбкой, не спуская глаз, смотрела на сцену, ощущая яркий свет, разлитый по всей зале и теплый, толпою согретый воздух. Наташа мало-по-малу начинала приходить в давно не испытанное ею состояние опьянения. Она не помнила, что она и где она и что перед ней делается. Она смотрела и думала, и самые странные мысли неожиданно, без связи, мелькали в ее голове. То ей приходила мысль вскочить на рампу и пропеть ту арию, которую пела актриса, то ей хотелось зацепить веером недалеко от нее сидевшего старичка, то перегнуться к Элен и защекотать ее.","After the village, and in the serious mood in which Natasha was, all this was wild and surprising to her. She could not follow the progress of the opera, could not even hear the music: she saw only painted cardboard and strangely dressed men and women moving strangely, talking and singing in the bright light; she knew what all this was supposed to represent, but it was all so pretentiously false and unnatural that she felt ashamed of the actors, then laughed at them. She looked around her, at the faces of the spectators, looking for in them the same sense of mockery and bewilderment that was in her; but all the faces were attentive to what was happening on the stage and expressed feigned, as it seemed to Natasha, admiration. ""It must be so necessary!"" thought Natasha. She alternately looked either at these rows of pomaded heads in the stalls, or at the naked women in the boxes, especially at her neighbor Helen, who, completely undressed, with a quiet and calm smile, without taking her eyes off the stage, feeling the bright light spilled throughout the hall and the warm, crowd-warmed air. Natasha, little by little, began to come into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for a long time. She did not remember what she was and where she was and what was happening before her. She looked and thought, and the strangest thoughts suddenly, without connection, flashed through her head. Now she had the idea of jumping up on the ramp and singing the aria that the actress sang, then she wanted to hook the old man who was sitting not far from her with a fan, then to lean over to Helen and tickle her.","After the country, and with the serious mood she was in, Natasha found all this wild and astonishing. She was unable to follow the course of the opera; she could not even hear the music: she saw only painted cardboard and strangely dressed-up men and women, who moved, talked, and sang strangely in the bright light; she knew what it was all supposed to represent, but it was all so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt embarrassed for the performers, and then found them ridiculous. She looked around at the faces of the spectators, seeking in them the same feeling of mockery and perplexity that was in her; but all the faces were attentive to what was taking place on stage and expressed admiration—feigned, as it seemed to Natasha. “That must be how it's supposed to be!” she thought. She kept looking alternately now at the rows of pomaded heads in the parterre, now at the bare women in the boxes, particularly at her neighbor Hélène, who, totally undressed, with a quiet and calm smile, never took her eyes off the stage. Sensing the bright light spread all through the theater and the warm air heated by the crowd, Natasha was gradually beginning to get into a state of inebriation such as she had not experienced for a long time. She did not remember who she was and where she was and what was happening before her. She looked and thought, and the strangest thoughts flashed through her head unexpectedly, without connection. Now the thought came to her of jumping up to the footlights and singing the aria the actress was singing, then she wanted to touch a little old man who was sitting not far away with her fan, then to lean over to Hélène and tickle her.","After her life in the country, and in her present serious mood, all this seemed grotesque and amazing to Natasha. She could not follow the opera nor even listen to the music, she saw only the painted cardboard and the queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke, and sang so strangely in that brilliant light. She knew what it was all meant to represent, but it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors and then amused at them. She looked at the faces of the audience, seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she herself experienced, but they all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage, and expressed delight which to Natasha seemed feigned. ‘It must be, this is how it is all supposed to be!’ she thought. She kept looking round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the semi-nude women in the boxes, especially at Hélène in the next box, who—apparently quite unclothed—sat with a quiet tranquil smile, not taking her eyes off the stage. And feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd, Natasha little by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for a long while. She did not realize who and where she was, nor what was going on before her. As she looked and thought, the strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her mind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and singing the air the actress was singing, then she wished to touch with her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then to lean over to Hélène and tickle her."

"Небольшое общество, собравшееся в старомодной, высокой, с старой мебелью, гостиной перед обедом, было похоже на собравшийся, торжественный совет судилища.

"Вдруг всё зашевелилось, толпа заговорила, подвинулась, опять раздвинулась, и между двух расступившихся рядов, при звуках заигравшей музыки, вошел государь. За ним шли хозяин и хозяйка. Государь шел быстро, кланяясь направо и налево, как бы стараясь скорее избавиться от этой первой минуты встречи. Музыканты играли Польской, известный тогда по словам, сочиненным на него. Слова эти начинались: «Александр, Елизавета, восхищаете вы нас…» Государь прошел в гостиную, толпа хлынула к дверям; несколько лиц с изменившимися выражениями поспешно прошли туда и назад. Толпа опять отхлынула от дверей гостиной, в которой показался государь, разговаривая с хозяйкой. Какой-то молодой человек с растерянным видом наступал на дам, прося их посторониться. Некоторые дамы с лицами, выражавшими совершенную забывчивость всех условий света, портя свои туалеты, теснились вперед. Мужчины стали подходить к дамам и строиться в пары Польского.","Suddenly everything stirred, the crowd began to speak, moved, parted again, and between the two parted rows, at the sound of music playing, the sovereign entered. Behind him were the owner and mistress. The emperor walked quickly, bowing to the right and left, as if trying to get rid of this first minute of the meeting as soon as possible. The musicians played Polish, known then for the words composed on it. These words began: “Alexander, Elizabeth, you delight us ...” The sovereign went into the living room, the crowd rushed to the doors; several faces with changed expressions hurried back and forth. The crowd again retreated from the doors of the living room, in which the sovereign appeared, talking with the hostess. Some young man with a confused look was advancing on the ladies, asking them to step aside.

"В ту минуту как дверь отворилась и вошел неизвестный человек, Пьер испытал чувство страха и благоговения, подобное тому, которое он в детстве испытывал на исповеди: он почувствовал себя с глазу на глаз с совершенно чужим по условиям жизни и с близким, по братству людей, человеком. Пьер с захватывающим дыханье биением сердца подвинулся к ритору (так назывался в масонстве брат, приготовляющий ищущего к вступлению в братство). Пьер, подойдя ближе, узнал в риторе знакомого человека, Смольянинова, но ему оскорбительно было думать, что вошедший был знакомый человек: вошедший был только брат и добродетельный наставник. Пьер долго не мог выговорить слова, так что ритор должен был повторить свой вопрос.","At the moment the door opened and an unknown person entered, Pierre experienced a feeling of fear and reverence, similar to the one he experienced in confession as a child: he felt face to face with a completely alien in terms of living conditions and with a close one, in the brotherhood of people, man. Pierre, with a breath-taking beating of his heart, moved towards the rhetor (that was the name in Freemasonry of a brother who prepares a seeker to join the brotherhood). Pierre, coming closer, recognized in the rhetorician a familiar person, Smolyaninov, but it was insulting to him to think that the person who entered was a familiar person: the one who entered was only a brother and a virtuous mentor. Pierre could not utter a word for a long time, so the rhetorician had to repeat his question.","At the moment when the door opened and the unknown man came in, Pierre experienced a feeling of fear and awe similar to what he had experienced in childhood at confession; he felt himself alone with a man who was a total stranger in the circumstances of life, yet close in the brotherhood of men. With a pounding heart that took his breath away, Pierre moved towards the rhetor (so the masons call a brother who prepares a seeker to enter the brotherhood). Coming closer, Pierre recognized the rhetor as an acquaintance, Smolyaninov, but it offended him to think that he was an acquaintance: the man who had come in was only a brother and a virtuous preceptor. For a long time, Pierre could not utter a word, so that the rhetor had to repeat his question:","At the moment the door opened and the stranger came in Pierre felt a sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at confession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete stranger, yet near to him through the brotherhood of man. With bated breath and beating heart he moved towards the Rhetor (by which name the brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was known). Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew, Smolyaninov, and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an acquaintance—he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor. For a long time he could not utter a word, so that the Rhetor had to repeat his question."
"Все в доме чувствовали для кого ездил князь Андрей, и он, не скрывая, целый день старался быть с Наташей. Не только в душе Наташи испуганной, но счастливой и восторженной, но во всем доме чувствовался страх перед чем-то важным, имеющим совершиться. Графиня печальными и серьезно-строгими глазами смотрела на князя Андрея, когда он говорил с Наташей, и робко и притворно начинала какой-нибудь ничтожный разговор, как скоро он оглядывался на нее. Соня боялась уйти от Наташи и боялась быть помехой, когда она была с ними. Наташа бледнела от страха ожидания, когда она на минуты оставалась с ним с глазу на глаз. Князь Андрей поражал ее своей робостью.

Not only in the soul of Natasha, frightened, but happy and enthusiastic, but in the whole house, fear was felt before something important that had to be accomplished. The countess looked at Prince Andrei with sad and seriously stern eyes when he spoke with Natasha, and timidly and feigningly began some insignificant conversation, as soon as he looked back at her. Sonya was afraid to leave Natasha and was afraid to be a hindrance when she was with them. Natasha turned pale with fear of anticipation when she remained face to face with him for minutes.

"— Что я думаю? я слушал тебя. Всё это так, — сказал князь Андрей. — Но ты говоришь: вступи в наше братство, и мы тебе укажем цель жизни и назначение человека, и законы, управляющие миром.

"Но еще он не кончил стихов, как громогласный дворецкий провозгласил: «Кушанье готово!» Дверь отворилась, загремел из столовой польский: «Гром победы раздавайся, веселися храбрый росс», и граф Илья Андреич, сердито посмотрев на автора, продолжавшего читать стихи, раскланялся перед Багратионом. Все встали, чувствуя, что обед был важнее стихов, и опять Багратион впереди всех пошел к столу. На первом месте, между двух Александров — Беклешова и Нарышкина, что тоже имело значение по отношению к имени государя, посадили Багратиона: 300 человек разместились в столовой по чинам и важности, кто поважнее, поближе к чествуемому гостю: так же естественно, как вода разливается туда глубже, где местность ниже.","But he had not yet finished the verses, when the loud butler proclaimed: ""The meal is ready!""

Everyone stood up, feeling that dinner was more important than poetry, and again Bagration went ahead of everyone to the table. In the first place, between the two Alexandrovs - Bekleshov and Naryshkin, which also mattered in relation to the name of the sovereign, they put Bagration: 300 people were seated in the dining room according to rank and importance, who is more important, closer to the honored guest: as naturally as water spills to deeper where the terrain is lower.","But before he finished the verses, the loud-voiced butler announced: “Dinner is served!” The door opened, from the dining room thundered the polonaise: “Thunder of victory resound, be of good cheer, O valiant Russ ...”—and Count Ilya Andreich, glancing angrily at the author, who went on reading his verses, bowed before Bagration. They all stood up, feeling that dinner was more important than verses, and again Bagration went ahead of everyone to the table. He was seated in the first place, between two Alexanders— Bekleshov and Naryshkin—which also made reference to the sovereign's name. Three hundred people were then seated in the dining room by rank and importance, the more important closer to the guest of honor, as naturally as water flows deeper where the terrain is lower.","But before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo announced that dinner was ready. The door opened, and from the dining-room came the resounding strains of the Polonaise: Conquest’s joyful thunder waken, Triumph, valiant Russians, now! … and Count Rostov, glancing angrily at the author who went on reading his verses, bowed to Bagration. Everyone rose, feeling that dinner was more important than verses, and Bagration, again preceding all the rest, went in to dinner. He was seated in the place of honour between two Alexanders—Bekleshov and Naryshkin—which was a significant allusion to the name of the sovereign. Three hundred persons took their seats in the dining-room, according to their rank and importance: the more important nearer to the honoured guest, as naturally as water flows deepest where the land lies lowest."

"Проехали перевоз, на котором он год тому назад говорил с Пьером.

В лесу было почти жарко, ветру не слышно было. Береза вся обсеянная зелеными клейкими листьями, не шевелилась и из-под прошлогодних листьев, поднимая их, вылезала зеленея первая трава и лиловые цветы.

"«Шестьсот рублей, туз, угол, девятка… отыграться невозможно!.. И как бы весело было дома… Валет на пе… это не может быть!.. И зачем же он это делает со мной?…» думал и вспоминал Ростов. Иногда он ставил большую карту; но Долохов отказывался бить её, и сам назначал куш. Николай покорялся ему, и то молился Богу, как он молился на поле сражения на Амштетенском мосту; то загадывал, что та карта, которая первая попадется ему в руку из кучи изогнутых карт под столом, та спасет его; то рассчитывал, сколько было шнурков на его куртке и с столькими же очками карту пытался ставить на весь проигрыш, то за помощью оглядывался на других играющих, то вглядывался в холодное теперь лицо Долохова, и старался проникнуть, что в нем делалось.","“Six hundred rubles, an ace, a corner, a nine ... it’s impossible to win back! .. And how fun it would be at home ... Jack on a ne ... it can’t be! .. And why is he doing this to me? ... ”Rostov thought and recalled. Sometimes he played a big card; but Dolokhov refused to beat her, and he appointed the jackpot. Nicholas submitted to him, and then he prayed to God, as he prayed on the battlefield on the Amsteten bridge; now he guessed that the card that first fell into his hand from a pile of curved cards under the table would save him; either he calculated how many laces were on his jacket and with the same number of points he tried to bet the card on the entire loss, then he looked around at the other players for help, then he peered into Dolokhov’s now cold face, and tried to penetrate what was going on in it.","“Six hundred roubles, ace, corner, nine ... I can't win it all back! ... And how cheerful it would be at home... A jack, ah, no... it can't be! ... And why is he doing this to me? ...” Rostov thought and tried to recall. Occasionally he staked a large sum, but Dolokhov refused to play and set the stake himself. Nikolai obeyed him, and first he prayed to God as he had prayed during the battle on the Amstetten bridge; then he decided that the first card that came to hand from the pile of bent cards under the table would be the one to save him; then he counted the cords on his jacket and chose the card with the same number to stake against his entire loss; then he looked at the other players for help; then he peered into the now cold face of Dolokhov and tried to figure out what was going on in him.","‘Six hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine … winning it back’s impossible … Oh, how pleasant it was at home! … The knave, double or quits … it can’t be! … And why is he doing this to me?’ Rostov pondered.

Nikolai submitted to him, and at one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge over the Enns, and then guessed that the card that came first to hand from the crumpled heap under the table would save him, now counted the cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the total of his losses on it, then he looked round for aid from the other players, or peered at the now cold face of Dolokhov and tried to read what was passing in his mind."

Между князем Андреем и Наташей после дня предложения установились совсем другие чем прежде, близкие, простые отношения. Они как будто до сих пор не знали друг друга. И он и она любили вспоминать о том, как они смотрели друг на друга, когда были еще ничем, теперь оба они чувствовали себя совсем другими существами: тогда притворными, теперь простыми и искренними. Сначала в семействе чувствовалась неловкость в обращении с князем Андреем; он казался человеком из чуждого мира, и Наташа долго приучала домашних к князю Андрею и с гордостью уверяла всех, что он только кажется таким особенным, а что он такой же, как и все, и что она его не боится и что никто не должен бояться его. После нескольких дней, в семействе к нему привыкли и не стесняясь вели при нем прежний образ жизни, в котором он принимал участие. Он про хозяйство умел говорить с графом и про наряды с графиней и Наташей, и про альбомы и канву с Соней. Иногда домашние Ростовы между собою и при князе Андрее удивлялись тому, как всё это случилось и как очевидны были предзнаменования этого: и приезд князя Андрея в Отрадное, и их приезд в Петербург, и сходство между Наташей и князем Андреем, которое заметила няня в первый приезд князя Андрея, и столкновение в 1805-м году между Андреем и Николаем, и еще много других предзнаменований того, что случилось, было замечено домашними.","There was no betrothal, and no one was announced about Bolkonsky's engagement to Natasha; Prince Andrew insisted on this. He said that since he was the cause of the delay, he must bear the full burden of it. He said that he had forever bound himself with his word, but that he did not want to bind Natasha and gave her complete freedom. If in six months she feels that she does not love him, she will be in her own right if she refuses him. It goes without saying that neither the parents nor Natasha wanted to hear about it; but Prince Andrei insisted on his own. Prince Andrei visited the Rostovs every day, but not like a groom treated Natasha: he told her you and only kissed her hand. Between Prince Andrei and Natasha, after the day of the proposal, completely different than before, close, simple relations were established. They didn't seem to know each other until now. Both he and she loved to remember how they looked at each other when they were still nothing, now they both felt like completely different beings: then pretended, now simple and sincere. At first, the family felt awkward in dealing with Prince Andrei; he seemed like a man from an alien world, and Natasha for a long time accustomed her family to Prince Andrei and proudly assured everyone that he only seemed so special, and that he was the same as everyone else, and that she was not afraid of him and that no one should be afraid his. After a few days, the family got used to him and did not hesitate to lead the old way of life with him, in which he took part. He knew how to talk about housekeeping with the count, and about outfits with the countess and Natasha, and about albums and canvases with Sonya. Sometimes the family Rostovs among themselves and under Prince Andrei were surprised at how all this happened and how obvious the omens of this were: both the arrival of Prince Andrei in Otradnoye, and their arrival in Petersburg, and the similarity between Natasha and Prince Andrei, which the nanny noticed on the first visit Prince Andrei, and the clash in 1805 between Andrei and Nikolai, and many other omens of what happened, were noticed at home.","There was no formal betrothal, nor was anyone told of the engagement of Bolkonsky and Natasha; Prince Andrei insisted on that. He said that, as he was the cause of the delay, he must bear all the burden of it. He said that he had forever bound himself by his word, but that he did not want to bind Natasha and gave her full freedom. If in six months she felt that she did not love him, she would be within her rights to refuse him. Of course it went without saying that neither the parents nor Natasha wanted to hear about it; but Prince Andrei insisted on having his way. Prince Andrei came to the Rostovs' every day, but he did not behave like a fiancé with Natasha : he addressed her formally and kissed only her hand. Between Prince Andrei and Natasha, after the day of the proposal, close and simple relations were established, quite different from before. It was as if they had not known each other till then. He and she both liked to remember how they had looked at each other when they were still nothing: now they both felt themselves completely different beings; then they had been false, now they were simple and sincere. At first there was a feeling of awkwardness in the family in dealing with Prince Andrei; he seemed a man from an alien world, and Natasha spent a long time getting the household accustomed to Prince Andrei and proudly assured them all that he only seemed so peculiar, but that he was the same as everybody else, and that she was not afraid of him, and that no one should be afraid of him. After a few days, the family got used to him, and, without restraint, carried on their usual way of life, in which he participated. He was able to talk about estate management with the count, about dresses with the countess and Natasha, about albums and embroidery with Sonya. Occasionally the Rostov household expressed surprise among themselves and in Prince Andrei's presence at how it had all happened and how obvious the portents of it had been: Prince Andrei's coming to Otradnoe, and their coming to Petersburg, and the resemblance between Natasha and Prince Andrei, which the nanny had noticed during Prince Andrei's first visit, and the clash between Andrei and Nikolai in 1805, and many other portents of what had happened were noted by the household.","NO betrothal ceremony took place and Natasha’s engagement to Bolkonsky was not announced; Prince Andrei insisted on that. He said that as he was responsible for the delay, he ought to bear the whole burden of it; that he had given his word and bound himself for ever, but that he did not wish to bind Natasha and gave her perfect freedom. If after six months she felt that she did not love him, she would have full right to reject him. Naturally neither Natasha nor her parents wished to hear of this, but Prince Andrei was firm. He came every day to the Rostovs’, but did not behave to Natasha as an affianced lover: he did not use the familiar thou, but said you to her, and kissed only her hand. After their engagement, quite different, intimate, and natural relations sprang up between them. It was as if they had not known each other till now. Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other when as yet they were nothing to one another; they felt themselves now quite different beings: then they were artificial, now natural and sincere. At first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with Prince Andrei; he seemed a man from another world, and for a long time Natasha trained the family to get used to him, proudly assuring them all that he only appeared to be different, but was really just like all of them, and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be. After a few days they grew accustomed to him, and without restraint in his presence pursued their usual way of life, in which he took his part. He could talk about rural economy with the count, fashions with the countess and Natasha, and about albums and fancy-work with Sonya. Sometimes the household both among themselves and in his presence expressed their wonder at how it had all happened, and at the evident omens there had been of it: Prince Andrei’s coming to Otradnoe and their coming to Petersburg, and the likeness between Natasha and Prince Andrei which her nanny had noticed on his first visit, and Andrei’s encounter with Nikolai in 1805, and many other incidents betokening that it had to be."
"— Чего он мог желать и искать такого, чего бы он не нашел в моей дружбе?.. — сказал Наполеон, с недоумением пожимая плечами. — Нет, он нашел лучшим окружить себя моими врагами, и кем же? — продолжал он. — Он призвал к себе Штейнов, Армфельдов, Винцингероде, Бенигсенов, Штейн — прогнанный из своего отечества изменник, Армфельд — развратник и интриган, Винцингероде — беглый подданный Франции, Бенигсен несколько более военный, чем другие, но все-таки неспособный, который ничего не умел сделать в 1807 году и который бы должен возбуждать в императоре Александре ужасные воспоминания… Положим, ежели бы они были способны, можно бы их употреблять, — продолжал Наполеон, едва успевая словом поспевать за беспрестанно возникающими соображениями, показывающими ему его правоту или силу (что в его понятии было одно и то же), — но и того нет: они не годятся ни для войны, ни для мира. Барклай, говорят, дельнее их всех; но я этого не скажу, судя по его первым движениям. А они что делают? Что делают все эти придворные! Пфуль предлагает, Армфельд спорит, Бенигсен рассматривает, а Барклай, призванный действовать, не знает, на что решиться, и время проходит. Один Багратион — военный человек. Он глуп, но у него есть опытность, глазомер и решительность… И что за роль играет ваш молодой государь в этой безобразной толпе. Они его компрометируют и на него сваливают ответственность всего совершающегося. Un souverain ne doit etre a l'armee que quand il est general, [Государь должен находиться при армии только тогда, когда он полководец, ] — сказал он, очевидно, посылая эти слова прямо как вызов в лицо государя. Наполеон знал, как желал император Александр быть полководцем.","“What could he wish for and look for that which he would not have found in my friendship?” said Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders in bewilderment. - No, he found it best to surround himself with my enemies, and with whom? he continued. - He summoned the Steins, Armfelds, Wintzingerode, Benigsen, Stein - a traitor expelled from his fatherland, Armfeld - a libertine and intriguer, Wintzingerode - a fugitive subject of France, Benigsen is somewhat more military than others, but still incapable, who does nothing knew how to do in 1807 and which should have aroused terrible memories in Emperor Alexander ... Suppose, if they were capable, we could use them, ”continued Napoleon, barely managing to keep up with the incessantly arising considerations showing him his rightness or strength (which it was one and the same thing in his mind), but even that is not the case: they are not suitable for either war or peace. Barclay, they say, is more efficient than all of them; but I won't say that, judging by his first movements. What are they doing? What are all these courtiers doing! Pfuel proposes, Armfeld argues, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called to act, does not know what to decide on, and time passes. One Bagration is a military man. He is stupid, but he has experience, eye and determination ... And what role does your young sovereign play in this ugly crowd. They compromise him and blame everything that happens on him. Un souverain ne doit etre a l'armee que quand il est general, [The sovereign should be with the army only when he is a commander,] - he said, obviously sending these words directly as a challenge to the sovereign's face. Napoleon knew how much Emperor Alexander wanted to be a commander.","“What could he desire and seek that he could not have found in my friendship? ...” said Napoleon, with a shrug of perplexity. “No, he found it better to surround himself with my enemies—and who are they?” he went on. “He summoned the Steins, the Armfelts, the Wintzingerodes, the Bennigsens. Stein—a traitor driven from his fatherland; Armfelt—a debauchee and intriguer; Wintzingerode—a fugitive French subject; Bennigsen—a bit more of a soldier than the others, but all the same an incompetent, who was unable to do anything in 1807, and who must call up terrible memories in the emperor Alexander... [193] Let's suppose, if they were competent, they could be made use of,” Napoleon went on, barely able to keep up verbally with the constantly emerging considerations showing him his rightness or power (which to his mind were the same), “but that is not the case : they're no good either for peace or for war. They say Barclay is more capable than the rest; but I wouldn't say so, judging by his first moves. And what are they doing? What are all those courtiers doing? Pfuel proposes, Armfelt argues, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called upon to act, doesn't know what to decide on, and the time passes. Bagration alone is a military man. He's stupid, but he has experience, a good eye, and determination ... And what role does your young sovereign play in that outrageous crowd? They compromise him and shift onto him the responsibility for all that's happening. Un souverain ne doit être à l'armée que quand il est général,”[410] he said, obviously throwing these words as a challenge into the face of the sovereign. Napoleon knew how much Alexander wished to be a military commander.","‘What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship?’ demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders in perplexity. ‘But no, he has preferred to surround himself with my enemies, and with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and Wintzingerodes! * Stein, a traitor expelled from his own country; Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugitive French subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but all the same an incompetent, who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who should awaken terrible memories in the Emperor Alexander’s mind … Granted that were they competent they might be made use of,’ continued Napoleon—hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up proving how right and strong he was (in his perception the two were one and the same)—‘but they are not even that! They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to be the most capable of them all, but I cannot say so judging by his first movements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel* proposes, Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called on to act, does not know what to decide on, and time passes bringing no result. Bagration alone is a military man. He’s stupid, but he has experience, a quick eye, and resolution … And what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd? They compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that happens. Un souverain ne doit être à l’armée que quand il est général!’3 said Napoleon, evidently uttering these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander desired to be a military commander."

"Библейское предание говорит, что отсутствие труда — праздность была условием блаженства первого человека до его падения. Любовь к праздности осталась та же и в падшем человеке, но проклятие всё тяготеет над человеком, и не только потому, что мы в поте лица должны снискивать хлеб свой, но потому, что по нравственным свойствам своим мы не можем быть праздны и спокойны. Тайный голос говорит, что мы должны быть виновны за то, что праздны. Ежели бы мог человек найти состояние, в котором он, будучи праздным, чувствовал бы себя полезным и исполняющим свой долг, он бы нашел одну сторону первобытного блаженства. И таким состоянием обязательной и безупречной праздности пользуется целое сословие — сословие военное.

"Уже было начало июня, когда князь Андрей, возвращаясь домой, въехал опять в ту березовую рощу, в которой этот старый, корявый дуб так странно и памятно поразил его. Бубенчики еще глуше звенели в лесу, чем полтора месяца тому назад; всё было полно, тенисто и густо; и молодые ели, рассыпанные по лесу, не нарушали общей красоты и, подделываясь под общий характер, нежно зеленели пушистыми молодыми побегами.","It was already the beginning of June, when Prince Andrei, returning home, drove again into that birch grove in which this old, gnarled oak struck him so strangely and memorable.

"Князь Андрей приехал в Петербург в августе 1809 года. Это было время апогея славы молодого Сперанского и энергии совершаемых им переворотов. В этом самом августе, государь, ехав в коляске, был вывален, повредил себе ногу, и оставался в Петергофе три недели, видаясь ежедневно и исключительно со Сперанским. В это время готовились не только два столь знаменитые и встревожившие общество указа об уничтожении придворных чинов и об экзаменах на чины коллежских асессоров и статских советников, но и целая государственная конституция, долженствовавшая изменить существующий судебный, административный и финансовый порядок управления России от государственного совета до волостного правления. Теперь осуществлялись и воплощались те неясные, либеральные мечтания, с которыми вступил на престол император Александр, и которые он стремился осуществить с помощью своих помощников Чарторижского, Новосильцева, Кочубея и Строгонова, которых он сам шутя называл comite du salut publique.

It was the time of the apogee of the glory of the young Speransky and the energy of the coups he carried out. In this very August, the sovereign, riding in a carriage, was thrown out, injured his leg, and remained in Peterhof for three weeks, seeing Speransky daily and exclusively. At that time, not only two decrees, so famous and alarming to society, were being prepared on the destruction of court ranks and on examinations for the ranks of collegiate assessors and state councilors, but also a whole state constitution, which was supposed to change the existing judicial, administrative and financial order of governing Russia from the state council to the volost board. Now those vague, liberal dreams with which Emperor Alexander came to the throne, and which he sought to realize with the help of his assistants Czartoryzhsky, Novosiltsev, Kochubey and Strogonov, whom he himself jokingly called comite du salut publique, were now realized and embodied.

"Французский полковник с трудом удерживал зевоту, но был учтив и, видимо, понимал все значение Балашева.

"— Позвольте мне вам представить брата, — беспокойно перебегая глазами с Наташи на Анатоля, сказала Элен. Наташа через голое плечо оборотила к красавцу свою хорошенькую головку и улыбнулась. Анатоль, который вблизи был так же хорош, как и издали, подсел к ней и сказал, что давно желал иметь это удовольствие, еще с Нарышкинского бала, на котором он имел удовольствие, которое не забыл, видеть ее. Курагин с женщинами был гораздо умнее и проще, чем в мужском обществе. Он говорил смело и просто, и Наташу странно и приятно поразило то, что не только не было ничего такого страшного в этом человеке, про которого так много рассказывали, но что напротив у него была самая наивная, веселая и добродушная улыбка.","“Let me introduce my brother to you,” Helen said, uneasily shifting her eyes from Natasha to Anatole.

Anatole, who was as good up close as he was from a distance, sat down next to her and said that he had long wanted to have this pleasure, ever since the Naryshkin ball, at which he had had the pleasure, which he had not forgotten, to see her. Kuragin with women was much smarter and simpler than in male society. He spoke boldly and simply, and Natasha was strangely and pleasantly struck by the fact that not only was there nothing so terrible in this man, about whom so much was said, but that, on the contrary, he had the most naive, cheerful and good-natured smile.","“Allow me to introduce my brother to you,” said Hélène, her eyes darting uneasily from Natasha to Anatole.

This appeal flattered Prince Andrei. - I have known you for a long time: firstly, in your case about your peasants, this is our first example, to which it would be so desirable to have more followers; and secondly, because you are one of those chamberlains who did not consider themselves offended by the new decree on court ranks, causing such rumors and gossip.","“I had no time to talk with you, Prince, amidst the animated conversation I was drawn into by that venerable elder,” he said with a mildly scornful smile, as if acknowledging by that smile that he and Prince Andrei understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking.

Князь Андрей вошел в комнату и остановился перед ней, у изножья дивана, на котором она лежала. Блестящие глаза, смотревшие детски, испуганно и взволнованно, остановились на нем, не изменяя выражения. «Я вас всех люблю, я никому зла не делала, за что я страдаю? помогите мне», говорило ее выражение.

"Получив это известие поздно вечером, когда он был один в своем кабинете, старый князь, как и обыкновенно, на другой день пошел на свою утреннюю прогулку; но был молчалив с приказчиком, садовником и архитектором и, хотя и был гневен на вид, ничего никому не сказал.","Having received this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his study, the old prince, as usual, went for his morning walk the next day; but he was silent with the clerk, the gardener, and the architect, and, although he looked angry, he said nothing to anyone.","Having received this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his study, the old prince did not say anything to anyone.

Так, поездил и перестал, и перестал…","“Stop, Mom, I don’t think, and I don’t want to think!” So, I traveled and stopped, and stopped ...","“Stop it, mama, I'm not thinking and I don't want to think!

"Князь Андрей несколько раз оглянулся на этот дуб, проезжая по лесу, как будто он чего-то ждал от него. Цветы и трава были и под дубом, но он всё так же, хмурясь, неподвижно, уродливо и упорно, стоял посреди их.","Prince Andrei looked back at this oak tree several times as he rode through the forest, as if he was expecting something from him. There were flowers and grass under the oak, but he still, frowning, motionless, ugly and stubbornly, stood in the middle of them.","Prince Andrei turned several times to look at this oak as he drove through the woods, as if he expected something from it. There were flowers and grass beneath the oak as well, but it stood among them in the same way, scowling, motionless, ugly, and stubborn.","As he passed through the forest Prince Andrei turned several times to look at that oak, as if expecting something from it. Under the oak, too, were flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling, rigid, misshapen, and grim as ever."
"— Ну вот Денисов всё тужил, — сказал Ростов, — вот и провиант прибыл.","“Well, Denisov was still grieving,” said Rostov, “so the provisions have arrived.”","“Well, so Denisov got all upset,” said Rostov, “and here come the provisions.”","‘There now, Denisov has been worrying,’ said Rostov, ‘and here are the provisions.’"
"— Да… я скажу ему, — говорил Пьер, — но… — Он не знал, что сказать.","“Yes ... I will tell him,” Pierre said, “but ...” He did not know what to say.","“Yes ... I'll tell him,” said Pierre, “but ...” He did not know what to say.","‘Yes … I will tell him,’ answered Pierre; ‘but …’ He did not know what to say."
"Теперь должно было ехать, если не в отставку, то в отпуск. Почему надо было ехать, он не знал; но выспавшись после обеда, он велел оседлать серого Марса, давно не езженного и страшно-злого жеребца, и вернувшись на взмыленном жеребце домой, объявил Лаврушке (лакей Денисова остался у Ростова) и пришедшим вечером товарищам, что подает в отпуск и едет домой. Как ни трудно и странно было ему думать, что он уедет и не узнает из штаба (что ему особенно интересно было), произведен ли он будет в ротмистры, или получит Анну за последние маневры; как ни странно было думать, что он так и уедет, не продав графу Голуховскому тройку саврасых, которых польский граф торговал у него, и которых Ростов на пари бил, что продаст за 2 тысячи, как ни непонятно казалось, что без него будет тот бал, который гусары должны были дать панне Пшаздецкой в пику уланам, дававшим бал своей панне Боржозовской, — он знал, что надо ехать из этого ясного, хорошего мира куда-то туда, где всё было вздор и путаница.","Now I had to go, if not retired, then on vacation. Why it was necessary to go, he did not know; but having slept after dinner, he ordered to saddle gray Mars, a stallion that had not been ridden for a long time and a terribly evil stallion, and returning home on a lathered stallion, he announced to Lavrushka (Denisov's lackey remained at Rostov) and his comrades who had come in the evening that he was taking a vacation and going home. No matter how hard and strange it was for him to think that he would leave and not find out from the headquarters (which he was especially interested in) whether he would be promoted to captain, or receive Anna for his last maneuvers; strange as it was to think that he would leave without selling to Count Golukhovskiy the troika of savras, whom the Polish count traded with him, and whom Rostov bet that he would sell for 2 thousand, no matter how incomprehensibly it seemed that without him there would be that ball , which the hussars were supposed to give to Panna Pshazdetskaya in spite of the uhlans, who gave a ball to their Panna Borzhozovskaya, he knew that he had to go from this clear, good world somewhere to where everything was nonsense and confusion.","Now he ought to go, if not into retirement, then at least on leave. Why he had to go, he did not know; but, having slept after dinner, he gave orders to saddle his gray Mars, a long unridden and terribly ill-tempered stallion, and returning home with the stallion all in a lather, he announced to Lavrushka (Denisov's footman, who had remained with Rostov) and the comrades who came in the evening that he was taking a leave and going home. Difficult and strange as it was for him to think that he would go without having learned from staff what especially interested him—whether he was to be promoted to captain or get an Anna[154] for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to think that he would go without selling to Count Goluchowski a troika of grays that the Polish count wanted to buy, and that Rostov had bet he could sell for two thousand; incomprehensible as it seemed that he would not be at the ball the hussars were to give for Panna Przazdiecka, to spite the uhlans, who were giving a ball for their Panna Borzozowska—he knew that he had to go from this clear, good world to somewhere where everything was nonsense and confusion.","The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious grey stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavrushka (Denisov’s servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who turned up in the evening, that he was applying for leave and was going home. Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would go away without having heard from the staff—and this interested him extremely—whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the Order of St Anne for the last manoeuvres; strange as it was to think that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the Polish Count Goluchowski, who was bargaining for the horses Rostov had betted he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honour of the Polish Mademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the uhlans, who had given one in honour of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would take place without him— he knew he must go away from this good, bright world, to somewhere where everything was stupid and confused."
"— A celui qui s'est le plus vaillament conduit dans cette derieniere guerre, [Тому, кто храбрее всех показал себя во время войны, ] — прибавил Наполеон, отчеканивая каждый слог, с возмутительным для Ростова спокойствием и уверенностью оглядывая ряды русских, вытянувшихся перед ним солдат, всё держащих на караул и неподвижно глядящих в лицо своего императора.","- A celui qui s'est le plus vaillament conduit dans cette derieniere guerre, [To the one who showed himself the most bravely during the war,] - Napoleon added, rapping out each syllable, with outrageous calmness and confidence for Rostov, looking around the ranks of Russians stretched out in front of him soldiers, keeping everything on guard and motionless looking into the face of their emperor.","“A celui qui s'est le plus vaillamment conduit dans cette dernière guerre,”[335] Napoleon added, rapping out every syllable with a calm and assurance that Rostov found outrageous, and looking over the ranks of Russian soldiers standing at attention before him, still presenting arms and looking fixedly at the face of their emperor.","‘A celui qui s’est le plus vaillamment conduit dans cette dernière guerre,’2 added Napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and assurance exasperating to Rostov he ran his eye over the Russian ranks drawn up before him, who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their Emperor."
