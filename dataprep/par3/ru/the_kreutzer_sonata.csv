XXIII,XXIII,XXIII,CHAPTER XXIII
"— Да, да, это, это самое, — перебил он меня. — Это самое, то, что я хочу сказать вам, это-то и объясняет то необыкновенное явление, что, с одной стороны, совершенно справедливо то, что женщина доведена до самой низкой степени унижения, с другой стороны — что она властвует. Точно так же как евреи, как они своей денежной властью отплачивают за свое угнетение, так и женщины. «А, вы хотите, чтобы мы были только торговцы. Хорошо, мы, торговцы, завладеем вами», — говорят евреи. «А, вы хотите, чтобы мы были только предмет чувственности, хорошо, мы, как предмет чувственности, и поработим вас», — говорят женщины. Не в том отсутствие прав женщины, что она не может вотировать или быть судьей — заниматься этими делами не составляет никаких прав, — а в том, чтобы в половом общении быть равной мужчине, иметь право пользоваться мужчиной и воздерживаться от него по своему желанию, по своему желанию избирать мужчину, а не быть избираемой. Вы говорите, что это безобразно. Хорошо. Тогда чтоб и мужчина не имел этих прав. Теперь же женщина лишена того права, которое имеет мужчина. И вот, чтоб возместить это право, она действует на чувственность мужчины, через чувственность покоряет его так, что он только формально выбирает, а в действительности выбирает она. А раз овладев этим средством, она уже злоупотребляет им и приобретает страшную власть над людьми.","""Yes, yes, that's it, that's it,"" he interrupted me. “That is the very thing, what I want to tell you, this is what explains that extraordinary phenomenon that, on the one hand, it is absolutely true that a woman is reduced to the lowest degree of humiliation, on the other hand, that she rules. Just like the Jews, just as they repay their oppression with their monetary power, so do women. “Ah, you want us to be just merchants. All right, we merchants will take possession of you,” the Jews say. “Ah, you want us to be only an object of sensuality, well, we, as an object of sensuality, will enslave you,” the women say. Not in the lack of rights of a woman, that she cannot vote or be a judge - to engage in these matters does not constitute any rights - but in being equal in sexual intercourse with a man, having the right to use a man and abstain from him at will, according to her desire to elect a man, and not to be elected. You say it's ugly. Good. Then so that the man did not have these rights. Now a woman is deprived of the right that a man has. And so, in order to compensate for this right, she acts on the sensuality of a man, through sensuality conquers him in such a way that he only formally chooses, but in reality she chooses. And once it has mastered this means, it already abuses it and acquires a terrible power over people.","‘Yes, yes, that’s just the point,’ he said, interrupting me. ‘ That’s exactly what I’m trying to tell you, that’s what explains this curious phenomenon: from one point of view, it’s perfectly correct to say that woman has been brought to the lowest degree of subjection, but from another point of view it’s equally true to say that she’s the dominant one. Women are exactly like the Jews, who by their financial power compensate for the oppression to which they’re subjected. “Aha, you just want us to be merchants, do you? All right, then, it’s as merchants that we’ll lord it over you,” say the Jews. “Aha, you just want us to be the objects of your sensuality, do you? All right, then, it’s as the objects of your sensuality that we’ll enslave you,” say women. Women’s lack of rights has nothing to do with them not being allowed to vote or be judges – those matters don’t constitute any sort of right. No, it has to do with the fact that in sexual relations she’s not the man’s equal. She doesn’t have the right to avail herself of the man or abstain from him, according to her desire, to select the man she wants rather than be the one who’s selected. You may say that would be monstrous. Very well. Then the man shouldn’t have these rights, either. The way things are at present, the woman is deprived of the rights possessed by the man. And, in order to compensate for this, she acts on the man’s sensuality, forces him into subjection by means of sensuality, so that he’s only formally the one who chooses – in actual fact it’s she who does the choosing. And once she has mastered this technique, she abuses it and acquires a terrible power over men.’","“Yes, yes, that’s the very point!” he exclaimed, interrupting me. “That’s the very thing I wanted to say to you! And that is just what explains the extraordinary phenomenon that, on the one hand, woman is reduced to the lowest degree of humiliation while, on the other, she is the queen. Exactly as the Jews, by their power, avenge themselves for their humiliation, so it is with women. ‘Ah, you want us to be merely merchants; very well, as merchants we will get you under our feet,’ say the Jews. ‘Ah, you wish us to be merely the objects of sensuality; very well, as objects of sensual pleasure we will make you our slaves,’ say the women. A woman’s lack of rights does not consist in the fact that she cannot vote or sit as judge—for rights are not embraced in any such activities—but in the fact that in sexual intercourse she is not the equal of a man: she does not have the right to enjoy a man or keep him at a distance according to her fancy; she cannot choose her husband according to her own desire instead of being the one chosen. “You say that this would be unbecoming. Very good, then don’t let the man have these rights. Now the woman lacks the right which the man has. And now, in order to get this right, she plays on the passions of man; by means of his passions, she subdues him so that, while seemingly he chooses, she is really the one. And having once learned this power, she abuses it and acquires a terrible control over men.”"
"— Нет, уж это время прошло, — сказала она. Но адвокат остановил ее:","“No, that time has passed,” she said. But the lawyer stopped her:","‘No, those days have gone,’ she said. But the lawyer would not allow her to continue.","“No, those days are gone,” she said. But the lawyer interrupted her."
— А такой: да боится своего му-у-ужа! Вот какой страх.,"- And this one: yes, he is afraid of his mu-u-uzha! That's what fear.","‘What sort of fear?’ asked the lady. ‘Fear of her hu-u-usband, of course. That kind of fear.’","“Fear of what?” asked the lady. “Why, fear of her husband of course—that kind of fear.”"

"— Желательно бы знать, как вы объясняете связь между образованием и несогласием в супружестве, — чуть заметно улыбаясь, сказал адвокат.","“I would like to know how you explain the connection between education and disagreement in marriage,” the lawyer said with a slight smile.","‘I’d like to hear you explain the connection you see between education and marital discord,’ the lawyer said, with a faint smile.","“I should like to know how you explain the connection between culture and matrimonial quarrels,” said the lawyer with a slight smile."
"Я видел, что ему мучительно было называть этого человека, вспоминать, говорить о нем. Но он сделал усилие и, как будто порвав то препятствие, которое мешало ему, решительно продолжал:","I saw that it was painful for him to name this person, to remember, to talk about him. But he made an effort and, as if breaking through the obstacle that hindered him, continued resolutely:","I could see it was torture for him to mention this man, to remember him and talk about him. But he made the effort and, as if he had tugged clear some obstacle that was in his way, he continued in a resolute tone of voice: ‘He was a rubbishy fellow, as far as I could see or judge, and not because he’d acquired this importance in my life, but because he really was what I say he was.","I saw that it was difficult for him to mention that man, to recall him, even to allude to him. But he made an effort and, as though breaking through the barrier which hindered him, he resolutely went on."
"— Бывало, сударь, и прежде, только меньше, — сказал он. — По нынешнему времени нельзя этому не быть. Уж очень образованны стали.","“It happened before, sir, only less,” he said. “At the present time, it is impossible not to be. They have become very educated.","‘Oh there was, sir. It’s just that there wasn’t so much of it, that’s all,’ he said. ‘You can’t expect anything else nowadays. They’ve all gotten that well educated.’","“The same thing took place, sir, in old times, only less frequently,” said he. “At the present time it can’t help happening. People have grown cultured!”"
"— В старину этого не было, не правда ли? — сказал он, приятно улыбаясь.","It didn't exist in the old days, did it? he said, smiling pleasantly.","‘There was none of that sort of thing in the old days, was there?’ he said, smiling affably.","“It wasn’t so in old times, was it?” he remarked, smiling pleasantly."
"— Я начал понимать только тогда, когда увидал ее в гробу… — Он всхлипнул, но тотчас же торопливо продолжал: — Только тогда, когда я увидал ее мертвое лицо, я понял все, что я сделал. Я понял, что я, я убил ее, что от меня сделалось то, что она была живая, движущаяся, теплая, а теперь стала неподвижная, восковая, холодная и что поправить этого никогда, нигде, ничем нельзя. Тот, кто не пережил этого, тот не может понять… У! у! у!.. — вскрикнул он несколько раз и затих.","“I only began to understand when I saw her in the coffin…” He sobbed, but immediately continued hurriedly: “It was only when I saw her dead face that I understood everything I had done. I realized that I, I had killed her, that it had become from me that she was alive, moving, warm, and now she had become motionless, waxy, cold, and that this could never, nowhere, be corrected by anything. Those who have not experienced this cannot understand... Wow! u! uh!” he exclaimed several times and fell silent.","‘I only began to grasp it when I saw her in her coffin…’ He gave a sob, but continued hastily, at once: ‘It was only when I saw her dead face that I realized what I’d done. I realized that I’d killed her, that it was all my doing that from a warm, moving, living creature she’d been transformed into a cold, immobile waxen one, and that there was no way of setting this to rights, not ever, not anywhere, not by any means. If you’ve never experienced that, you can’t possibly understand… Oh! Oh! Oh!’ he cried several times, and fell silent.","“I began to understand only when I beheld her in her coffin.” He sobbed, but immediately continued. “Only when I beheld her dead face did I realize what I had done. I realized that I—I—had killed her, that it was through me that she, who had been living, moving, warm, was now motionless, waxlike, and cold, and that there was no way of ever again making it right—never, never again! He who has not lived through this cannot understand! Oh! Oh! Oh!” he cried several times and said no more."
— Как порок? — сказал я. — Ведь вы говорите о самом естественном человеческом свойстве.,"- How vice? - I said. “After all, you are talking about the most natural human property.","‘Why vice?’ I asked. ‘I mean to say, you’re talking about one of the most natural human activities there is!’","“Vice? What do you mean?” I asked. “Why, you are talking about one of the most natural human functions!”"
"Но ни тот, ни другой не договорили: то же самое бешенство, которое я испытывал неделю тому назад, овладело мной. Опять я испытал эту потребность разрушения, насилия и восторга бешенства и отдался ему.","But neither one nor the other finished speaking: the same fury that I experienced a week ago took possession of me. Again I experienced this need of destruction, violence and ecstasy of rage and gave myself to it.","‘But neither of them managed to get to the end of their sentences. That same rabid frenzy I had experienced a week previously once more took possession of me. Once again I felt that compulsion to destroy, to subjugate by force, to rejoice in the ecstasy of my furious rage, and I abandoned myself to it.","The very same madness I had experienced a week before took possession of me! Once more I felt the necessity of destroying something, of using violence! Once more I sensed the ecstasy of madness and I yielded to it!"
Седой господин опять засмеялся.,The gray-haired gentleman laughed again.,The grey-haired man began to laugh again.,The gray-haired gentleman laughed again.
"Я не мог продохнуть и не мог остановить трясущихся челюстей. «Да, стало быть, не так, как я думал: то прежде я думал — несчастье, а оказалось все хорошо, по-старому. Теперь же вот не по-старому, а вот оно все то, что я представлял себе и думал, что только представлял, а вот оно все в действительности. Вот оно все…»","I couldn't breathe and couldn't stop my shaking jaws. “Yes, therefore, not in the way I thought: I used to think it was a misfortune, but it turned out everything was fine, in the old way. Now, it’s not the old way, but here it is all that I imagined and thought that I only imagined, but here it is all in reality. That's all…”","‘I could hardly breathe, and I couldn’t stop the shaking in my jaws. “That means it’s not the way I thought it was ,” I said to myself. “I used to think, ‘disaster’ – and yet everything would turn out to be just the same as before. It isn’t like that this time; this time it’s all happened, everything I used to think about and imagine, only now it isn’t imaginings but reality. It’s here, all of it…”","“I could not breathe freely, nor could I prevent the trembling of my jaw. ‘ Yes, of course, it is not as I thought it might be; whereas formerly I imagined some misfortune and yet found everything all right, as usual, now it was not usual, now it was altogether what I had imagined and fancied that I only imagined, but it was now real. It was all . . .’"
"Бред продолжался все время. Она не узнавала никого. В тот же день, к полдню, она померла. Меня прежде этого, в восемь часов, отвели в часть и оттуда в тюрьму. И там, просидев одиннадцать месяцев, дожидаясь суда, я обдумал себя и свое прошедшее и понял его. Начал понимать я на третий день. На третий день меня водили туда…","Brad continued all the time. She didn't recognize anyone. On the same day, by noon, she died. Before that, at eight o'clock, they took me to the unit and from there to the prison. And there, after sitting for eleven months, waiting for the trial, I thought about myself and my past and understood it. I began to understand on the third day. On the third day they took me there...","‘After that, her fever became continuous. She couldn’t recognize anyone any more. She died towards noon that same day. Before then, at eight a.m. to be precise, I’d been taken to the local police station and from there to prison. And there I remained for eleven months awaiting trial. During that time I thought a great deal about myself and my past life, and I grasped what it had all been about. I began to grasp it on my third day. It was on that third day that they took me there…’","“The delirium continued to the very end. She did not recognize anyone. On the same day, at noon, she died. Before that, at eight o’clock in the morning, I was arrested and taken to prison. And there, while I was confined for eleven months waiting for my trial, I had a chance to meditate on myself and my past life, and I came to understand it. On the third day I began to comprehend. On the third day they took me there.”"
"— Да-с, явился этот человек. — Он замялся и раза два произвел носом свои особенные звуки.","Yes, this man has come. He hesitated and made his peculiar noises with his nose twice.","Almost immediately, however, he made a visible effort to pull himself together, and continued: ‘Yes, and then this man appeared.’ He faltered and made his peculiar nasal sounds a couple of times.","“Yes, that man appeared.” He hesitated, and twice produced through his nose his peculiar sounds."
"Утром, когда после примирения я признался ей, что ревновал ее к Трухачевскому, она нисколько не смутилась и самым естественным образом засмеялась. Так странна даже ей казалась, как она говорила, возможность увлечения к такому человеку.","In the morning, when, after reconciliation, I confessed to her that I was jealous of Trukhachevsky, she was not at all embarrassed and laughed in the most natural way. It seemed so strange even to her, as she said, the possibility of infatuation with such a person.","‘In the morning, when after our reconciliation I confessed to her that I’d been jealous of her and Trukhachevsky, she wasn’t at all upset and burst into the most artless laughter, so strange, as she said, did it seem to her, this idea that she might be interested in a man like that.","“In the morning, after our reconciliation, I confessed to her that I was jealous of Trukhashevsky. She was not in the least confused, and laughed in the most natural manner. So strange to her seemed, as she said, the possibility of being drawn to such a man!"
"— Вот вы напомнили про детей. Опять какое страшное лганье идет про детей. Дети — благословенье божие, дети — радость. Ведь это все ложь. Все это было когда-то, но теперь ничего подобного нет. Дети — мученье, и больше ничего. Большинство матерей так прямо и чувствуют и иногда нечаянно прямо так и говорят это. Спросите у большинства матерей нашего круга достаточных людей, они вам скажут, что от страха того, что дети их могут болеть и умирать, они не хотят иметь детей, не хотят кормить, если уж родили, для того чтобы не привязаться и не страдать. Наслажденье, которое доставляет им ребенок прелестью его, этих ручек, ножек, тельца всего, удовольствие, доставляемое ребенком, — меньше страданья, которое они испытывают — не говоря уже от болезни или потери ребенка, но от одного страха за возможность болезней и смерти. Взвесив выгоды и невыгоды, оказывается, что невыгодно и потому нежелательно иметь детей. Они это прямо, смело говорят, воображая, что эти чувства происходят в них от любви к детям, чувства хорошего и похвального, которым они гордятся. Они не замечают того, что этим рассуждением они прямо отрицают любовь, а утверждают только свой эгоизм. Для них меньше удовольствия от прелести ребенка, чем страданий от страха за него, и потому не надо того ребенка, которого они будут любить. Они жертвуют не собою для любимого существа, а имеющим быть любимым существом для себя.","- You mentioned the children. Again, what a terrible lie is about children. Children are God's blessing, children are joy. After all, it's all a lie. All this was once, but now there is nothing like it. Children are a torment, and nothing more. Most mothers feel this directly and sometimes inadvertently say it directly. Ask the majority of mothers in our circle of sufficient people, they will tell you that because of the fear that their children might get sick and die, they do not want to have children, do not want to feed, if they have already given birth, in order not to become attached and not suffer. The pleasure that a child gives them by the charm of him, these arms, legs, the body of everything, the pleasure delivered by a child is less than the suffering that they experience - not to mention from illness or loss of a child, but from one fear of the possibility of illness and death. After weighing the benefits and disadvantages, it turns out that it is disadvantageous and therefore undesirable to have children. They say this directly, boldly, imagining that these feelings originate in them from love for children, a feeling of good and laudable, which they are proud of. They do not notice that by this reasoning they directly deny love, but affirm only their egoism. For them, there is less pleasure from the charm of a child than suffering from fear for him, and therefore they do not need the child they will love. They do not sacrifice themselves for a beloved being, but a being who has to be loved for himself.","‘You mentioned children just now. Again, what awful lies we spread about children. Children are God’s blessing on us, children are a delight. It’s all lies, you know. All that may have been true once upon a time, but it isn’t nowadays. Children are a torment, nothing more. Most mothers know this, and will sometimes be quite frank about it. Most mothers in our well-off section of society will tell you they’re so scared their children are going to fall ill and die, they don’t want to have any, and even if they do have children, they don’t want to breast-feed them in case they grow too attached to them and suffer as a result. The pleasure their baby gives them with the grace and charm of its being, of its little arms and legs, of the whole of its young body, the enjoyment they receive from their baby is not as great as the suffering they endure – not even because it falls ill or dies, but because of their fear that it may do so. Once they’ve weighed the advantages against the disadvantages, it seems to them that having children is disadvantageous, and therefore undesirable. They say this boldly and frankly, imagining that these feelings stem from their love of children, from a good and praiseworthy sentiment they’re proud of. They don’t notice that by talking like this they do nothing but negate love and affirm their own selfishness. They find less enjoyment than suffering in the grace and charm of their baby because of the fear they have for its safety, and so they don’t really want this child which they are going to love. They don’t sacrifice themselves for a being they love, what they do is sacrifice to themselves a being that’s intended to be loved.","“You mentioned the children. There, again, what terrible lying goes on about children! ‘Children are a divine benediction.’ ‘Children are a delight.’ That is all a lie. They used to be so but now there is nothing of the sort, nothing at all. Children are a torment, nothing less! The majority of mothers feel so, and some of them do not hesitate to say so. Ask the greater number of the mothers of our circle—people of means—and they will tell you that they do not wish to have children because the children may get sick and die. If they are born, they do not want to suckle them because they may grow too devoted to the children and suffer sorrow. The delight which the child affords them by its beauty, its tiny little arms, its little feet, its whole body—the satisfaction is less than the agony, not from illness or loss of the child, but from the mere worry about the possibility of illness and death. Having weighed the advantages and disadvantages, it seems disadvantageous, and therefore not desirable, to have children. They say this openly, boldly, imagining that these sentiments grow out of their love for their children—good, praiseworthy feelings in which they take pride. They do not notice this: that by such reasoning they directly renounce love and assert their selfishness. For them there is less pleasure from the charm of a child than suffering from worry about it; therefore they don’t want a child which they would come to love. They do not sacrifice themselves for the beloved creature, but they sacrifice the beloved creature for themselves."
"— Ах, это ужасно, что вы говорите; но есть же между людьми то чувство, которое называется любовью и которое дается не на месяцы и годы, а на всю жизнь?","“Oh, it’s terrible what you say; But is there between people that feeling which is called love, and which is given not for months and years, but for a lifetime?","‘Oh, but what you’re saying is dreadful! Surely there’s an emotion that exists between people called love, a feeling that lasts not just months or years, but for the whole of their lives?’","“Oh, what you say is awful! Surely there exists among human beings that feeling which is called love and which lasts not merely for months and years, but for whole lives!”"
"— Через два дня я уехал в уезд, в самом хорошем, спокойном настроении простившись с женой. В уезде всегда бывало пропасть дела и совсем особенная жизнь, особенный мирок. Два дня я по десяти часов проводил в присутствии. На другой день мне в присутствие принесли письмо от жены. Я тут же прочел его. Она писала о детях, о дяде, о нянюшке, о покупках и между прочим, как о вещи самой обыкновенной, о том, что Трухачевский заходил, принес обещанные ноты и обещал играть еще, но что она отказалась. Я не помнил, чтобы он обещал принести ноты: мне казалось, что он тогда простился совсем, и потому это неприятно поразило меня. Но дела было столько, что некогда было подумать, и я только вечером, вернувшись на квартиру, перечел письмо. Кроме того, что Трухачевский без меня был еще раз, весь тон письма показался мне натянутым. Бешеный зверь ревности зарычал в своей конуре и хотел выскочить, но я боялся этого зверя и запер его скорей. «Какое мерзкое чувство эта ревность! — сказал я себе. — Что может быть естественнее того, что она пишет?»","- Two days later I left for the county, in the best, calmest mood, saying goodbye to my wife. In the county there was always an abyss of business and a very special life, a special little world. For two days I spent ten hours in the presence. The next day, a letter from my wife was brought to my presence. I read it right away. She wrote about children, about her uncle, about a nanny, about shopping, and by the way, as about the most ordinary thing, that Trukhachevsky came in, brought the promised notes and promised to play more, but that she refused. I did not remember that he promised to bring the music: it seemed to me that he then said goodbye completely, and therefore this struck me unpleasantly. But there was so much to do that there was no time to think, and only in the evening, returning to the apartment, did I reread the letter. Apart from the fact that Trukhachevsky came again without me, the whole tone of the letter seemed forced to me. The mad beast of jealousy growled in its kennel and wanted to jump out, but I was afraid of this beast and locked it up quickly. “What a vile feeling this jealousy! I said to myself. “What could be more natural than what she writes?”","‘Two days later, having said goodbye to my wife in the best and most tranquil of moods, I went off to the provinces. In my particular district there was always an enormous amount of business to attend to, and the place had a life of its own; it was a little world apart. On each of my first two days in the district town I spent ten hours in the zemstvo headquarters. On the second day a letter from my wife was brought to me in the council chamber. I read it there and then. She wrote about the children, about our uncle, about the nurse, about things she had bought and then in passing, as if in reference to the most ordinary event, about a visit she’d had from Trukhachevsky: he’d apparently brought her the music he’d promised her and had suggested they play together again, but she had refused. I couldn’t remember him having promised to bring any music: it had seemed to me at the time that he’d said a definitive goodbye, and what she described gave me a nasty jolt. However, I had so much to do that there wasn’t any time to reflect about it, and it was only in the evening, when I got back to my lodgings, that I read her letter through again properly. It wasn’t just the fact that Trukhachevsky had been to the house again in my absence. The whole tone of the letter seemed forced to me. The rabid beast of jealousy began to snarl in its kennel, trying to get out, but I was afraid of that beast, and I hastily locked it up inside me. “What a loathsome thing jealousy is!” I told myself. “Nothing could be more natural than what’s in her letter.”","“Two days later I started for my district meetings, taking leave of my wife in the happiest and calmest frame of mind. “In our district there was always a pile of work and a special life, a special little world. For two days I worked ten hours a day in my office. On the third day a letter from my wife was brought to me in the office. I read it at once. “She wrote about the children, about her uncle, about the nurse, about the things she had bought, and mentioned—as something perfectly commonplace—the fact that Trukhashevsky had called to bring the music he had promised and that he had offered to come to play again but that she had declined. “I did not remember that he had promised to bring any music. I had supposed that he had taken his final leave at that time, and so this was an unpleasant surprise. But I was so deeply engrossed in business that I could not stop to think further about it; it was not until evening, when I returned to my room, that I reread her letter. “Besides the fact that Trukhashevsky had called again in my absence, the whole tone of the letter seemed to me unnatural. The frantic beast of jealousy roared in his cage and wanted to break forth. I was afraid of this beast and I shut him up. “ ‘What a vile feeling this jealousy is!’ I said to myself. ‘What can be more natural than what she has written?’"

"— Так как же быть? — сказал я. — Что же, женщине делать предложение?","- So how to be? - I said. - What, a woman to propose?",‘But how do you think it ought to be?’ I asked. ‘Should the woman be the one to propose?’,"“What is to be done then?” I asked. “You would not expect the young women to make the offers, would you?”"
"— Однако вы не любите докторов, — сказал я, заметив особенно злое выражение голоса всякий раз, как он упоминал только о них.","""But you don't like doctors,"" I said, noticing a particularly angry expression in his voice whenever he mentioned only them.","‘I can see you don’t like doctors,’ I said. I had observed that at the very mention of them his voice acquired a peculiarly malevolent intonation.","“You obviously don’t like doctors?” I said, having noticed the particularly bitter tone in his voice every time he mentioned them."
"Ведь что это за путаница! Из тысячи женящихся мужчин не только в нашем быту, но, к несчастью, и в народе, едва ли есть один, который бы не был женат уже раз десять, а то и сто или тысячу, как Дон-Жуан, прежде брака. (Есть теперь, правда, я слышу и наблюдаю, молодые люди чистые, чувствующие и знающие, что это не шутка, а великое дело. Помоги им бог! Но в мое время не было ни одного такого на десять тысяч.) И все знают это и притворяются, что не знают. Во всех романах до подробностей описаны чувства героев, пруды, кусты, около которых они ходят; но, описывая их великую любовь к какой-нибудь девице, ничего не пишется о том, что было с ним, с интересным героем, прежде: ни слова о его посещениях домов, о горничных, кухарках, чужих женах. Если же есть такие неприличные романы, то их не дают в руки, главное, тем, кому нужнее всего это знать, — девушкам. Сначала притворяются перед девушками в том, что того распутства, которое наполняет половину жизни наших городов и деревень даже, что этого распутства совсем нет. Потом так приучаются к этому притворству, что наконец, как англичане, сами начинают искренно верить, что мы все нравственные люди и живем в нравственном мире. Девушки же, те, бедные, верят в это совсем серьезно. Так верила и моя несчастная жена. Помню, как, уже будучи женихом, я показал ей свои дневник, из которого она могла узнать хотя немного мое прошедшее, главное — про последнюю связь, которая была у меня и о которой она могла узнать от других и про которую я потому-то и чувствовал необходимость сказать ей. Помню ее ужас, отчаяние и растерянность, когда она узнала и поняла. Я видел, что она хотела бросить меня тогда. И отчего она не бросила!","After all, what a mess! Of the thousands of men who marry, not only in our everyday life, but, unfortunately, among the people, there is hardly one who has not been married ten times, or even a hundred or a thousand, like Don Juan, before marriage. (There are now, however, I hear and observe, young people who are pure, feeling and knowing that this is not a joke, but a great thing. God help them! But in my time there was not a single one like that in ten thousand.) And everyone knows this and pretend they don't know. In all novels, the feelings of the characters, the ponds, the bushes around which they walk are described in detail; but, describing their great love for some girl, nothing is written about what happened to him, with an interesting hero, before: not a word about his visits to houses, about maids, cooks, other people's wives. If there are such indecent novels, then they are not given into the hands, most importantly, to those who need to know this most of all - girls. First, they pretend to the girls that the debauchery that fills half the life of our cities and villages even that this debauchery does not exist at all. Then they become so accustomed to this pretense that at last, like the English, they themselves begin to sincerely believe that we are all moral people and that we live in a moral world. The girls, those poor ones, believe in it quite seriously. So did my unfortunate wife. I remember how, already being a fiancé, I showed her my diary, from which she could learn at least a little about my past, the main thing is about the last connection that I had and about which she could learn from others and about which I therefore felt the need to tell her. I remember her horror, despair and confusion when she found out and understood. I saw that she wanted to leave me then. And why didn't she quit?","‘What a tangled mess it all is! Out of a thousand men who get married, not only in our own class but also, regrettably, among the common people as well, there’s scarcely one who hasn’t already been married ten times, if not a hundred or even a thousand times, like Don Juan, before his marriage. (Nowadays there are, it’s true, as I’ve heard and observed , pure young men who know and sense that this is no laughing-matter, but a great and serious undertaking. May God give them strength! In my day there wasn’t one chap in ten thousand like that.) And everyone knows this, yet pretends not to. In novels the hero’s emotions are described in detail, just like the ponds and bushes he walks beside; but while they describe his grand amour for some young girl or other, they say nothing about what has taken place in the life of this interesting hero previously: there’s not a word about his visits to brothels, about the chamber-maids, the kitchen-maids, the wives of other men. Even if indecent novels of this type do exist, they’re certainly not put into the hands of those who most need to know all this – young girls. At first we pretend to them that this debauchery, which fills up the lives of half the inhabitants of our towns and villages, doesn’t exist at all. Subsequently we grow so accustomed to this pretence that we end up like the English, secure in the honest conviction that we are all of the very highest morality and that we live in a world that is morally perfect. The poor girls take it all very seriously. I know my own wretched wife did. I remember that after we’d got engaged I let her read my diary,5 so she could get some idea of the sort of life I’d been leading previously and in particular some knowledge of my last affair, which she might have found out about from other people and which I therefore considered it necessary to tell her about. I remember her horror, despair and perplexity when she learned about it and the whole thing dawned on her. I could see she was thinking of leaving me. If only she had!’","“See what an entanglement it was! Out of a thousand married men—not only in our rank, but unfortunately also in the masses— there is scarcely one who, like Don Juan, would not have been married already not merely ten times, but even a hundred or a thousand times before the marriage ceremony. “It is true there are now—so I hear, and I believe it— some young men who live pure lives, feeling and knowing that this is no joke, but a serious matter. “God help them! But in my time there was not one such out of ten thousand. And all men know this and pretend that they do not know it. In novels the feelings of the heroes, the ponds, the bushes around which they wander, are described in detail; but though their overpowering love for some particular maiden is described, nothing is said about what the interesting hero was doing before, not a word about his frequenting brothels, about his relations with chambermaids, cooks, and other women. Novels of this improper kind—if there are any— are not put into the hands of those who most need to know about these things—that is, young women. “At first they pretend to young women that this dissipation, which fills half the life of our cities and villages, does not exist at all. “In time, we ourselves become so accustomed to this hypocrisy that we actually come to believe that all of us really are moral men and live in a moral world! Girls, poor things, believe this with seriousness! “So did my wife believe too. I remember how, after we became engaged, I showed her my diary5 so that she might learn as much as she would like, even though it were very little, of my past and especially about the last affair in which I had been involved, for she might later hear about this from others and I felt it better to tell her. I remember her horror, her despair and disillusionment when she knew it all and realized what it meant. I saw that she was tempted to break our engagement. And why didn’t she do it?”"

"— Женят таких, которые не любят друг друга, а потом удивляются, что несогласно живут, — торопилась говорить дама, оглядываясь на адвоката и на меня и даже на приказчика, который, поднявшись с своего места и облокотившись на спинку, улыбаясь, прислушивался к разговору. — Ведь это только животных можно спаривать, как хозяин хочет, а люди имеют свои склонности, привязанности, — очевидно желая уязвить купца, говорила она.","“They marry those who don’t love each other, and then they are surprised that they don’t live together,” the lady hurried to say, looking around at the lawyer and at me and even at the clerk, who, having risen from his seat and leaning on his back, smiling, listened to the conversation. . “After all, only animals can be mated as the owner wants, and people have their own inclinations, affections,” she said, obviously wanting to hurt the merchant.","‘People who don’t love one another are forced to get married, and then everyone wonders why they can’t live in harmony together,’ said the lady hurriedly, turning an appraising eye on the lawyer, myself and even on the salesclerk, who had risen out of his seat and was leaning his elbows on its back, listening to the conversation with a smile. ‘After all, if’s only animals that can be mated at their masters’ will; human beings have inclinations and attachments of their own,’ she went on, apparently from a desire to say something wounding to the merchant.","“People who do not love each other marry and then wonder that they don’t get along,” said the lady hastily, glancing at the lawyer and then at me and even at the clerk, who had got up and, standing with his elbow on the back of the chair, was listening to the conversation with a smile. “Animals can be paired off in this way as their master may wish, but men and women have individual preferences and attachments,” she said, evidently wanting to say something severe to the old merchant."
"А мы были два ненавидящих друг друга колодника, связанных одной цепью, отравляющие жизнь друг другу и старающиеся не видать этого.

"Так изволите видеть, вот как и когда началось то, что привело меня к моему эпизоду. Началось это тогда, когда мне было невступно шестнадцать лет. Случилось это, когда я был еще в гимназии, а брат мой старший был студент первого курса. Я не знал еще женщин, но я, как и все несчастные дети нашего круга, уже не был невинным мальчиком: уже второй год я был развращен мальчишками; уже женщина, не какая-нибудь, а женщина, как сладкое нечто, женщина, всякая женщина, нагота женщины уже мучала меня. Уединения мои были нечистые. Я мучался, как мучаются 0,99 наших мальчиков. Я ужасался, я страдал, я молился и падал. Я уже был развращен в воображении и в действительности, но последний шаг еще не был сделан мною. Я погибал один, но еще не налагая руки на другое человеческое существо. Но вот товарищ брата, студент, весельчак, так называемый добрый малый, то есть самый большой негодяй, выучивший нас и пить и в карты играть, уговорил после попойки ехать туда. Мы поехали. Брат тоже еще был невинен и пал в эту же ночь. И я, пятнадцатилетний мальчишка, осквернил себя самого и содействовал осквернению женщины, вовсе не понимая того, что я делал. Я ведь ни от кого от старших не слыхал, чтоб то, что я делал, было дурно. Да и теперь никто не услышит. Правда, есть это в заповеди, но заповеди ведь нужны только на то, чтобы отвечать на экзамене батюшке, да и то не очень нужны, далеко не так, как заповедь об употреблении ut в условных предложениях.","So if you please see, that's how and when it started that led me to my episode. It started when I was sixteen years old. It happened when I was still in the gymnasium, and my older brother was a first-year student. I did not yet know women, but I, like all the unfortunate children of our circle, was no longer an innocent boy: for the second year I had been corrupted by boys; already a woman, not some kind, but a woman, like something sweet, a woman, every woman, the nakedness of a woman already tormented me. My retreats were unclean. I suffered as 0.99 of our boys suffer. I was horrified, I suffered, I prayed and fell. I had already been corrupted in imagination and in reality, but the last step had not yet been taken by me. I perished alone, but not yet laying hands on another human being. But then a friend of my brother, a student, a merry fellow, the so-called good fellow, that is, the biggest villain, who taught us to drink and play cards, persuaded us to go there after a drinking bout. We went. The brother, too, was still innocent and fell on the same night. And I, a fifteen-year-old boy, defiled myself and contributed to the defilement of a woman, not at all understanding what I was doing. After all, I never heard from any of the elders that what I did was bad. And now no one will hear. True, this is in the commandment, but the commandments are needed only to answer the priest in the exam, and even then they are not really needed, far from the same as the commandment about using ut in conditional sentences.","‘If you want to know, this is how and when it all began, the sequence of events that led up to that episode of mine. It started shortly before my sixteenth birthday. I was still at grammar school then. My older brother was a first-year student at university. As yet I had no experience of women, but like all the wretched boys of our social class I was no longer innocent. For more than a year I’d been exposed to the corrupting influence of the other boys. Woman – not any woman in particular but woman as a sweet, ineffable presence – woman, any woman, the nakedness of woman already tormented me. The hours I spent alone were not pure ones. I suffered in the way ninety-nine per cent of our youngsters suffer. I was horrified – I suffered, prayed, and succumbed. I was already corrupted, both in my imagination and in reality, but I had still not taken the final step. In my lonely way I was going from bad to worse, but so far I had not laid my hands on any other human being. But then one of my brother’s friends, a student, a bon vivant, one of those so-called “jolly good chaps” (an out-and-out villain, in other words), who had taught us to play cards and drink vodka, persuaded us to go with him to a certain place after a drinking-bout one evening. My brother was still a virgin, like myself, and he fell that very same night. And I, a fifteen-year-old boy, defiled myself and contributed to the defilement of a woman without the slightest understanding of what I was doing. After all, never once had I heard any of my elders say that what I was doing was wrong. And it’s not something you hear said nowadays, either. It’s true that it’s in the Ten Commandments, but you know as well as I do that they’re only useful for giving the school chaplain the right answers on examination day, and even then they’re not a great deal of help – much less so, for example, than knowing when to use ut in conditional clauses.","“Now you will see how and when things happened which led to that episode I mentioned. It began when I was not quite sixteen years old. I was still in high school and my oldest brother was a student at the university. I had not known a woman yet at that time but, like all the unfortunate boys of our circle, I was by no means an innocent child. Two years before I had been corrupted by coarse boys. Already woman, not any particular woman, but woman as a sweet something, woman, any woman—woman in her nakedness—had already begun to torment me. My solitudes were unchaste. I was tormented as ninety-nine per cent of our boys are tormented. I was afraid, I struggled, I prayed, and—I fell! My imagination was already corrupt. I myself was corrupt but the final step had not yet been taken. I was ruined by myself even before I had put my hands on another human being. But here a friend of my brother’s, a gay young student, a so-called good fellow—in other words, the greatest good-for-nothing possible, who had already taught us to drink and to play cards—persuaded us after a drinking session to go there. “We went. My brother had also been innocent, and he fell the same night. And I, a boy of fifteen, debased myself and accomplished the debasement of a woman, not at all understanding the enormity of what I was doing. You see, I had never learned from any of my elders that what I was doing was wrong. And even now no one ever says so. To be sure it is contained in the Ten Commandments, but the Commandments seem to be known only in order to pass an examination by a priest, and even then are not regarded as very important—not nearly so important as the rule for the use of ut in conditional sentences!"

"Началось с первых дней и продолжалось все время, и все усиливаясь и ожесточаясь. В глубине души я с первых же недель почувствовал, что я попался, что вышло не то, чего я ожидал, что женитьба не только не счастье, но нечто очень тяжелое, но я, как и все, не хотел признаться себе (я бы не признался себе и теперь, если бы не конец) и скрывал не только от других, но от себя. Теперь я удивляюсь, как я не видал своего настоящего положения. Его можно бы уже видеть потому, что ссоры начинались из таких поводов, что невозможно бывало после, когда они кончались, вспомнить из-за чего. Рассудок не поспевал подделать под постоянно существующую враждебность друг к другу достаточных поводов. Но еще поразительнее была недостаточность предлогов примиренья. Иногда бывали слова, объяснения, даже слезы, но иногда… ох гадко и теперь вспомнить — после самых жестоких слов друг другу вдруг молча взгляды, улыбки, поцелуи, объятия… Фу, мерзость! Как я мог не видеть всей гадости этого тогда…","It began from the first days and continued all the time, and all intensified and hardened. In the depths of my soul, from the very first weeks, I felt that I was caught, that it didn’t turn out what I expected, that marriage was not only not happiness, but something very difficult, but I, like everyone else, did not want to admit to myself (I would not confessed to himself even now, if not for the end) and hid it not only from others, but from himself. Now I wonder how I did not see my present position. It could already be seen because the quarrels began from such occasions that it was impossible after, when they ended, to remember why. Reason did not keep up with forging sufficient reasons for the constantly existing hostility to each other. But even more striking was the insufficiency of pretexts for reconciliation. Sometimes there were words, explanations, even tears, but sometimes ... oh, it's disgusting to remember now - after the most cruel words to each other, suddenly silent looks, smiles, kisses, hugs ... Fu, an abomination! How could I not see all the nastiness of this then ...","‘It set in right at the start of our married life together, and it continued without a break, increasing in intensity and bitterness. Even in the very first weeks I knew in the bottom of my heart that I’d been trapped, that this wasn’t what I’d been expecting, that not only was marriage not happiness, it was something exceedingly painful and distressing. But, like everyone else, I refused to admit this to myself (I’d still not have admitted it to myself even now if the whole thing hadn’t come to an end) and I hid it not only from others, but also from myself. It amazes me now that I didn’t realize the situation I was in. I ought to have understood it then, for our quarrels used to start from the kind of pretexts that made it impossible, later on, when it was all over, to remember what they’d been about. Our intelligences had no time in which to lay a foundation of satisfactory pretexts beneath the increasing hostility we felt for one another. But even more remarkable were the flimsy reasons we would find for patching up our differences. Sometimes there were talks, explanations, even tears, but sometimes… ugh, how vile it is to remember it even now – sometimes, after we had both said the cruellest things to one another, suddenly, without a word, there would be looks, smiles, embraces… Ugh! What loath-someness! How could I have failed to see the vile mediocrity of it all even then… ?’","“It began with us at the very first, it kept on all the time, and it grew more severe and more bitter. In the depths of my soul I felt from the very first that I was lost, that marriage had not turned out at all as I had expected, that it was not only not happiness but something very oppressive. But like all other men, I was not willing to acknowledge this—and I wouldn’t acknowledge it even now were it not for the sequel. I concealed it not only from others but even from myself. “Now I am amazed that I did not recognize my real position. It might have been seen in the fact that our quarrels arose from causes so minor that afterward, when they were ended, it was impossible to remember what brought them about. Our reason was not quick enough to offer sufficient pretexts for the hostility that constantly existed between us. “But still more amazing was the insufficiency of the pretexts for reconciliation. Occasionally it was a word or an explanation, even tears, but sometimes—oh, how disgusting when I remember it now!— after the bitterest words were exchanged, suddenly there would come silence, glances, smiles, kisses, embraces! Fu! How awful! Why did I fail to see the vileness of all this even then . . . ?”"

"— Ты решительно стал невозможен, — начала она. — Это такой характер, с которым ангел не уживется, — и, как всегда, стараясь уязвить меня как можно больнее, она напомнила мне мой поступок с сестрой (это был случай с сестрой, когда я вышел из себя и наговорил сестре своей грубости; она знала, что это мучит меня, и в это место кольнула меня). — После этого меня уж ничто не удивит от тебя, — сказала она.","""You've become absolutely impossible,"" she began. “This is a character that an angel cannot get along with,” and, as always, trying to hurt me as much as possible, she reminded me of my act with my sister (this was the case with my sister, when I lost my temper and told my sister my rudeness; she knew that it tormented me, and she stabbed me in this place). “After this, nothing will surprise me from you,” she said.","‘“You’ve really become impossible,” she began. “You’d wear out the patience of a saint.” And trying, as always, to be as wounding as she possibly could, she reminded me of how I had behaved towards her sister (on one occasion I’d lost my temper with her sister and been rudely offensive to her; she knew that this had caused me a lot of pain, and it was here that she chose to insert her dart). “Nothing you say or do will surprise me after this,” she said.","“ ‘You have become positively unendurable!’ she began. ‘You have such a disposition that not even an angel could get along with you!’ And, as always, trying to wound me as keenly as possible, she reminded me of the way I had treated my sister.

"Мужику, работнику, дети нужны, хотя и трудно ему выкормить, но они ему нужны, и потому его супружеские отношения имеют оправдание. Нам же, людям, имеющим детей, еще дети не нужны, они — лишняя забота, расход, сонаследники, они тягость. И оправдания свиной жизни для нас уж нет никакого. Или мы искусственно избавляемся от детей, или смотрим на детей как на несчастье, последствие неосторожности, что еще гаже. Оправданий нет. Но мы так нравственно пали, что мы даже не видим надобности в оправдании. Большинство теперешнего образованного мира предается этому разврату без малейшего угрызения совести.","A peasant, a worker, needs children, although it is difficult for him to feed him, but he needs them, and therefore his marital relations are justified. But we, people who have children, still do not need children, they are an extra worry, an expense, co-heirs, they are a burden. And there is no justification for a pig's life for us. Either we artificially get rid of children, or we look at children as a misfortune, a consequence of negligence, which is even worse. There are no excuses. But we have fallen so morally that we do not even see the need for justification. Most of today's educated world indulges in this depravity without the slightest remorse.","Even though it may be hard for him to feed them, a muzhik or a working man’s children are necessary to him, and for this reason his marriage relationship has a justification. But for our sort of people children aren’t necessary – they’re a superfluous worry, an extra expense, co-inheritors, a burden. And the pigsty existence we lead has no justification what so ever. We either get rid of our children by artificial methods, or we view them as a misfortune, a consequence of imprudent behaviour, which is even more loathsome. There’s no justification for it. But morally we’ve sunk so low that we don’t even see the need for a justification. Nowadays the greater part of the educated classes indulges in this debauchery without the slightest shadow of remorse.","“To the peasant, to the laboring man, children are a necessity; although it is hard for him to feed them, still he must have them and so the marital relations are justified.

And therefore there is no justification for our swinish life. Either we artificially prevent the birth of children or we regard children as a misfortune—as the consequence of carelessness, which is worse. “There is no justification. But we have fallen so low morally that we do not see the need for justification. The majority of men now belonging to the cultivated class give themselves up to this form of debauchery without the slightest twinge of conscience."

Спрашиваю, — так и есть, он тут. Прохожу не через гостиную, а через классную, в залу. Лиза, дочь, сидит за книжкой, и няня с маленькой у стола вертит какой-то крышкой. Дверь в залу затворена, и слышу оттуда равномерное arpeggio и голос его и ее. Прислушиваюсь, но не могу разобрать. Очевидно, звуки на фортепиано нарочно для того, чтобы заглушить их слова, поцелуи, может быть. Боже мой! что тут поднялось во мне! Как вспомню только про того зверя, который жил во мне тогда, ужас берет: сердце вдруг сжалось, остановилось и потом заколотило, как молотком. Главное чувство, как и всегда, во всякой злости, было — жалость к себе. «При детях, при няне!» — думал я. Должно быть, я был страшен, потому что и Лиза смотрела на меня странными глазами. «Что ж мне делать? — спросил я себя. — Войти? Я не могу, я бог знает что сделаю». Но не могу и уйти. Няня глядит на меня так, как будто она понимает мое положение. «Да нельзя не войти», — сказал я себе и быстро отворил дверь. Он сидел за фортепиано, делал эти arpeggio своими изогнутыми кверху большими белыми пальцами. Она стояла в углу рояля над раскрытыми нотами. Она первая увидала или услыхала и взглянула на меня. Испугалась ли она и притворилась, что не испугалась, или точно не испугалась, но она не вздрогнула, не пошевелилась, а только покраснела, и то после.","""It's strange how the presence of this man affected me,"" he began again, obviously making an effort to be calm. - I return home from the exhibition on the second or third day after that, I enter the hall and suddenly I feel something heavy, like a stone, leaning on my heart, and I cannot give myself an account of what it is. It was something that, as I was passing through the hallway, I noticed something resembling him. Only in the office did I realize what it was, and returned to the hall to check myself. Yes, I was not mistaken: it was his overcoat. You know, a fashionable overcoat. (Everything that concerned him, although I did not realize it to myself, I noticed with unusual attentiveness.) I ask - it is so, he is here. I pass not through the living room, but through the classroom, into the hall. Liza, the daughter, is sitting at a book, and the nanny with the little one at the table is turning some kind of lid. The door to the hall is closed, and from there I hear a steady arpeggio and the voice of him and her. I listen, but I can't make out. Obviously, the sounds on the piano are on purpose in order to drown out their words, kisses, maybe. My God! what has risen in me! As soon as I remember only about that beast that lived in me then, horror takes me: my heart suddenly contracted, stopped and then pounded like a hammer. The main feeling, as always, in any anger, was self-pity. “With children, with a nanny!” I thought. I must have been terrified, because Liza, too, was looking at me with strange eyes. “What am I to do? I asked myself. - To come in? I can't, God knows what I'll do."" But I can't leave. Nanny looks at me as if she understands my position. “Yes, it’s impossible not to come in,” I said to myself and quickly opened the door. He was sitting at the piano making these arpeggios with his big white thumbs that were bent upwards. She was standing in the corner of the piano over open sheet music. She was the first to see or hear and looked at me. Whether she was frightened and pretended not to be frightened, or definitely not frightened, she did not flinch, did not move, but only blushed, and then after that.","‘It’s strange, the effect that man’s presence had on me,’ he began again, making a visible effort to remain calm. ‘Coming home from an exhibition the following day or the day after, I entered the hallway and suddenly felt something heavy, like a stone, fall on my heart. At first I couldn’t work out what it was. It had to do with the fact that as I’d walked through the hallway I’d noticed something that had reminded me of him. It was only when I got to my study that I was able to work out what it had been, and I went back into the hallway to make sure. No, I hadn’t been seeing things: it was his overcoat. You know, one of those fashionable men’s overcoats. (Though I wasn’t aware of doing so at the time, I paid the most minute attention to everything that was connected with him.) I made inquiries: yes, I was right, he was here. I made for the ballroom, entering it from the schoolroom, not the drawing-room end. My daughter Liza was in the schoolroom, reading a book, and the nurse was sitting at the table with the youngest girl, helping her to spin a saucepan lid or something of the kind. The door into the ballroom was closed: I could hear regular arpeggios coming from inside, and the sound of their voices, talking. I listened, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying. It was obvious that the piano-playing was meant to drown out their voices, and perhaps their kisses, too. My God! The feelings that rose up in me! I’m seized with horror whenever I think of the wild beast that lived in me during that time. My heart suddenly contracted, stopped beating, and then started again like a hammer. The principal feeling I had was the one there is in all angry rage, that of self-pity. “In front of the children, in front of the nurse!” I thought. I must have been a dreadful sight, for Liza gave me a strange look. “What should I do?” I wondered. “Go in? I can’t. God knows what I might do.” But I couldn’t go away, either. The nurse was looking at me as though she understood my situation. “No, there’s nothing for it, I’ll have to go in,” I said to myself, and swiftly opened the door. He was sitting at the grand piano, playing those arpeggios with large, white, arched fingers. She was standing in the crook of the piano, looking at some musical scores she had opened out. She was the first to see me or hear me, and she glanced up at me quickly. Whether she was frightened but pretending not to be frightened, or whether she really wasn’t frightened at all, I don’t know, but she didn’t bat an eyelid, didn’t even move, but just blushed, and then only after a moment or two.","“It is strange what an effect the presence of that man had on me,” he began once more, making an effort to regain his calm. “Two or three days later I came home from a business exhibition, and as I entered the vestibule I became conscious of a sudden feeling of oppression—as if a stone had been rolled on my heart—and I could not explain it to myself. It was due to the fact that, as I was passing through the vestibule, I noticed something which reminded me of him. Only when I reached my study did I realize what it was. I returned to the vestibule to verify it. Yes, I had not been mistaken, it was his cloak. A fashionable cloak, of course. Everything about him—although I could not explain the why and wherefore—I observed with extraordinary attention. I asked if he was visiting and the servant said yes. I passed through the study room, not the drawing room, into the music room. My daughter, Lisa, was sitting with her book, and the nurse was sitting at the table with the little girl spinning a top. The door into the music room was closed, but I could hear the sound of arpeggios and the sound of her voice and his. I listened but could not hear their words. The notes of the piano were played on purpose to drown out their words, perhaps their kisses! My God, what a storm arose in me! The mere thought of the angry beast roused in me fills me with horror. My heart suddenly contracted, stopped, then began to pound like a sledge hammer. “My chief feeling, as always in an outburst of anger, was pity for myself. ‘ Before the children! Before the nurse!’ I exclaimed inwardly. I must have been terrible to look at because even Lisa looked at me with frightened eyes. ‘What is there for me to do?’ I asked myself. ‘Shall I go in? I can’t! God knows what I should do! But I can’t go away!’ The nurse was looking at me as if she understood my situation. ‘But I can’t just not go in!’ I said to myself and hurriedly flung open the door. “He was sitting at the piano playing those arpeggios with his long white fingers. She was standing at the other end of the grand piano bending over an opened score. She was the first to see or hear me and she looked up. I don’t know whether she was startled and pretended not to be startled or whether she really was not startled—at any rate, she did not show any agitation or even move. She merely blushed, but that was afterward."
"Нынче уж нельзя сказать: «Ты живешь дурно, живи лучше», — нельзя этого сказать ни себе, ни другому. А если дурно живешь, то причина в ненормальности нервных отправлений или т. п. И надо пойти к ним, а они пропишут на тридцать пять копеек в аптеке лекарства, и вы принимайте. Вы сделаетесь еще хуже, тогда еще лекарства и еще доктора. Отличная штука!","Today it is no longer possible to say: ""You live badly, live better"" - you cannot say this either to yourself or to another. And if you live badly, then the reason is in the abnormality of nervous functions, or the like. And you have to go to them, and they will prescribe medicine for thirty-five kopecks in a pharmacy, and you take it. You will get even worse, then more medicines and more doctors. Great stuff!","‘Nowadays it’s simply not done to say: “You’re living badly, you ought to try to live better.” If s not done to say that either to yourself or to someone else. If you’re living badly, it’s because your nerves aren’t functioning properly, or something of that sort. So you have to go to the doctors. They’ll prescribe you thirty-five copecks’ worth of medicine, and you’ll take it. You’ll just make yourself worse, and then you’ll have to take more medicines and consult more doctors. As a trick, it fairly takes your breath away!","Today, it is no longer enough to say, ‘You are living a bad life; live better.’ You can’t say that to yourself or to another. If you are living a bad life, the cause lies in the abnormal state of the nerves, and the like! And so you have to consult the doctors, and they prescribe an expensive medicine from the drugstore, and you take it! You grow worse . . . so you take new drugs and consult other doctors. An excellent racket!"
"Так от тех старших людей, мнения которых я уважал, я ни от кого не слыхал, чтобы это было дурно. Напротив, я слыхал от людей, которых я уважал, что это было хорошо. Я слышал, что мои борьбы и страдания утишатся после этого, я слышал это и читал, слышал от старших, что для здоровья это будет хорошо; от товарищей же слышал, что в этом есть некоторая заслуга, молодечество. Так что вообще, кроме хорошего, тут ничего не виделось. Опасность болезней? Но и та ведь предвидена. Попечительное правительство заботится об этом. Оно следит за правильной деятельностью домов терпимости и обеспечивает разврат для гимназистов. И доктора за жалованье следят за этим. Так и следует. Они утверждают, что разврат бывает полезен для здоровья, они же и учреждают правильный, аккуратный разврат. Я знаю матерей, которые заботятся в этом смысле о здоровье сыновей. И наука посылает их в дома терпимости.","So from those older people whose opinions I respected, I never heard from anyone that it was bad. On the contrary, I heard from people I respected that it was good. I heard that my struggles and sufferings would subside after this, I heard and read this, I heard from the elders that it would be good for health; but I heard from my comrades that there is some merit in this, valor. So in general, except for the good, there was nothing to see here. Danger of disease? But even that is foreseen. The Guardian Government takes care of it. It oversees the correct operation of brothels and ensures debauchery for schoolchildren. And salaried doctors keep an eye on it. So it should. They assert that debauchery is good for health, and they also establish correct, accurate debauchery. I know mothers who care in this sense about the health of their sons. And science sends them to brothels.","‘That’s the way it was: none of the older people whose opinions I respected ever told me that what I was doing was wrong. On the contrary, the people I looked up to told me it was the right thing to do. I was told that, after I had done it, my struggles and sufferings would ease. I was told this, and I read it. My elders assured me that it would be good for my health. As for my companions, they said it entailed a kind of merit, a certain bravado. Accordingly, I could see nothing but good in it. The danger of infection? But that, too, is taken care of. Our solicitous government takes pains to see to it. It supervises the orderly running of the licensed brothels and ensures the depravation of grammar-school boys. Even our doctors keep an eye on this problem, for a fee of course. That is only proper. They assert that debauchery is good for the health, for it’s they who have instituted this form of tidy, legalized debauchery. I even know mothers who take an active concern for this aspect of their son’s health. And science directs them to the brothels.’","“Thus I had never heard a single one of my elders, whom I respected, say that what we did was wrong. On the contrary, I heard men whom I respected say it was a good thing. I heard them say that one’s struggles and sufferings were relieved after that. I heard it and I read it, and I heard my elders say that it was good for the health. From my friends I heard that there was merit, even gallantry, in such conduct. So there was nothing to be expected from it but beneficial effects. Danger of disease? Even that is taken care of. A solicitous government looks out for that. It looks after and regulates the activity of brothels and makes lewdness safe. And doctors for a consideration do the same. Thus it comes about: they affirm that lewdness is good for the health and they make a regular institution of lewdness. I know of mothers who see to it that their sons’ health is cared for in this way. And science follows them into the brothels.”"
"— Ведь что, главное, погано, — начал он, — предполагается в теории, что любовь есть нечто идеальное, возвышенное, а на практике любовь ведь есть нечто мерзкое, свиное, про которое и говорить и вспоминать мерзко и стыдно. Ведь недаром же природа сделала то, что это мерзко и стыдно. А если мерзко и стыдно, то так и надо понимать. А тут, напротив, люди делают вид, что мерзкое и стыдное прекрасно и возвышенно. Какие были первые признаки моей любви? А те, что я предавался животным излишествам, не только не стыдясь их, но почему-то гордясь возможности этих физических излишеств, не думая притом нисколько не только о ее духовной жизни, но даже и об ее физической жизни. Я удивлялся, откуда бралось наше озлобление друг к другу, а дело было совершенно ясно: озлобление это было не что иное, как протест человеческой природы против животного, которое подавляло ее.","“After all, the main thing is nasty,” he began, “it is assumed in theory that love is something ideal, sublime, but in practice love is something vile, swine, about which it is disgusting and shameful to talk and remember. After all, it is not for nothing that nature has done what is disgusting and shameful. And if it is disgusting and ashamed, then it should be understood. And here, on the contrary, people pretend that the vile and shameful is beautiful and sublime. What were the first signs of my love? And those that I indulged in animal excesses, not only not being ashamed of them, but for some reason proud of the possibility of these physical excesses, moreover, without thinking at all not only about her spiritual life, but even about her physical life. I wondered where our animosity towards each other came from, but the matter was quite clear: this anger was nothing but a protest of human nature against the animal that suppressed it.","‘The vilest thing of all about it,’ he began, ‘is that in theory love’s supposed to be something ideal and noble, whereas in practice it’s just a sordid matter that degrades us to the level of pigs, something it’s vile and embarrassing to remember and talk about. After all, nature didn’t make it vile and embarrassing for no reason. If it’s vile and embarrassing, it ought to be seen as such. And yet it’s quite the contrary: people behave as though what was vile and embarrassing were something beautiful and noble. What were the first signs of my love? They were that I abandoned myself to animal excesses, not only quite unashamedly, but even taking pride in the fact that it was possible for me to indulge in them, without ever once taking thought for her spiritual or even her physical well-being. I wondered in astonishment where this relentless animosity we felt towards each other could possibly be coming from, yet the reason for it was staring me in the face: this animosity was nothing other than the protest of our human nature against the animality that was suffocating it.","“What is vilest about this,” he went on, “is that in theory love is something ideal and elevated, whereas in practice love is something low and swinish—something shameful and disgusting to mention or remember. You see, it was not without reason that nature made it shameful and disgusting . . . and, as such, it should be recognized and known by all. But we, on the contrary, pretend that what is low and shameful and disgusting is beautiful and elevated. “What were the first symptoms of my love? They were that I gave myself up to animal excesses, not only feeling no shame but feeling a certain pride about them, not thinking either of her spiritual life or even of her physical life. I wondered what caused our animosity toward each other, when the thing was perfectly clear: this animosity was nothing else than the protest of human nature against the animal which was crushing it!"
"— Убирайся, ради бога убирайся!","""Get out, for God's sake get out!""",‘“Just go. For God’s sake go!”,"“ ‘Get out of my sight! For God’s sake, get out!’"

What is this? What’s wrong with you? There’s nothing, nothing, nothing… I swear it!”","But she suddenly began to speak, and she seized my hand which held the dagger: ‘Come to your senses! What are you going to do? What is the matter with you? There has been nothing—no harm, I swear it!’"
"Я взглянул на детей, на ее с подтеками разбитое лицо и в первый раз забыл себя, свои права, свою гордость, в первый раз увидал в ней человека. И так ничтожно мне показалось все то, что оскорбляло меня, — вся моя ревность, и так значительно то, что я сделал, что я хотел припасть лицом к ее руке и сказать: «Прости!» — но не смел.","I looked at the children, at her bruised face with smudges, and for the first time I forgot myself, my rights, my pride, for the first time I saw a person in her. And everything that offended me seemed so insignificant to me - all my jealousy, and what I did was so significant that I wanted to lay my face on her hand and say: “Forgive me!” but didn't dare.","‘I looked at the children, at her battered face with its bruises, and for the first time I forgot about myself, about my marital rights and my injured pride; for the first time I saw her as a human being. And so insignificant did all that had hurt me and made me jealous appear, and so significant what I’d done, that I wanted to press my face to her hand and say: “Forgive me!” – but I didn’t dare to.","“I looked at the children, at her bruised and discolored face, and for the first time forgot myself, my rights, my pride. For the first time I recognized the human being in her.

"Он вдруг приподнялся и пересел к самому окну. — Извините меня, — проговорил он и, устремив глаза в окно, молча просидел так минуты три. Потом он тяжело вздохнул и опять сел против меня. Лицо его стало совсем другое, глаза жалкие, и какая-то странная почти улыбка морщила его губы. — Я устал немножко, но я расскажу. Еще времени много, не рассветало еще. Да-с, — начал он опять, закурив папиросу. — Она пополнела с тех пор, как перестала рожать, и болезнь эта — страдание вечное о детях — стало проходить; не то что проходить, но она как будто очнулась от пьянства, опомнилась и увидала, что есть целый мир божий с его радостями, про который она забыла, но в котором она жить не умела, мир божий, которого она совсем не понимала. «Как бы не пропустить! Уйдет время, не воротишь!» Так мне представляется, что она думала или скорее чувствовала, да и нельзя ей было думать и чувствовать иначе: ее воспитали в том, что есть в мире только одно достойное внимания — любовь. Она вышла замуж, получила кое-что из этой любви, но не только далеко не то, что обещалось, что ожидалось, но и много разочарований, страданий и тут же неожиданную муку — детей! Мука эта истомила ее. И вот благодаря услужливым докторам она узнала, что можно обойтись и без детей. Она обрадовалась, испытала это и ожила опять для одного того, что она знала, — для любви. Но любовь с огаженным и ревностью и всякой злостью мужем была уже не то. Ей стала представляться какая-то другая, чистенькая, новенькая любовь, по крайней мере, я так думал про нее. И вот она стала оглядываться, как будто ожидая чего-то. Я видел это и не мог не тревожиться. Сплошь да рядом стало случаться то, что она, как и всегда, разговаривая со мной через посредство других, то есть говоря с посторонними, но обращая речь ко мне, выражала смело, совсем не думая о том, что она час тому назад говорила противоположное, выражала полусерьезно, что материнская забота — это обман, что не стоит того — отдавать свою жизнь детям, когда есть молодость и можно наслаждаться жизнью. Она занималась детьми меньше, не с таким отчаянием, как прежде, но больше и больше занималась собой, своей наружностью, хотя она и скрывала это, и своими удовольствиями, и даже усовершенствованием себя. Она опять с увлечением взялась за фортепиано, которое прежде было совершенно брошено. С этого все и началось.","He suddenly got up and moved to the very window. ""Excuse me,"" he said, and, fixing his eyes on the window, he sat silently for about three minutes. Then he sighed heavily and sat down again opposite me. His face became completely different, his eyes were miserable, and a kind of strange almost smile wrinkled his lips. I'm a little tired, but I'll tell you. There's still plenty of time, it hasn't dawned yet. Yes, sir,” he began again, lighting a cigarette. - She has gained weight since she stopped giving birth, and this illness - eternal suffering for children - began to pass; not only to pass, but she seemed to wake up from drunkenness, came to her senses and saw that there was a whole world of God with its joys, about which she had forgotten, but in which she did not know how to live, the world of God, which she did not understand at all. “How not to miss! Time will pass, you won’t return!” So it seems to me that she thought, or rather felt, and it was impossible for her to think and feel otherwise: she was brought up in the fact that there is only one thing in the world worthy of attention - love. She got married, received something from this love, but not only far from what was promised, what was expected, but also a lot of disappointments, sufferings, and then unexpected torment - children! This agony wore her down. And thanks to helpful doctors, she learned that you can do without children. She rejoiced, experienced it, and came to life again for the one thing she knew - for love. But love with a fouled and jealousy and all sorts of anger husband was no longer the same. She began to imagine some other, clean, new love, at least that's what I thought about her. And then she began to look around, as if waiting for something. I saw it and couldn't help but worry. Quite often it began to happen that she, as always, speaking to me through the mediation of others, that is, speaking to strangers, but turning her speech to me, expressed boldly, not at all thinking that she had said the opposite an hour ago, expressed semi-seriously that maternal care is a deceit, that it is not worth it to give your life to children when there is youth and you can enjoy life. She took care of her children less, not with such desperation as before, but more and more took care of herself, her appearance, although she hid it, and her pleasures, and even self-improvement. She again enthusiastically took up the piano, which had previously been completely abandoned. Since this all started.","Suddenly he got up, moved over to the window and sat down there. ‘Excuse me,’ he said and, fixing his gaze on the window, sat there in silence for something like three minutes. Then he gave a deep sigh and came back to sit opposite me once more. His face had now altered completely; his eyes wore a beseeching expression, and something that might almost have been a smile creased his lips strangely. ‘I’m getting a bit tired, but I’ll tell you the rest of it. There’s a lot of time yet; if s still dark out there. Yes,’ he began once more, as he lit a cigarette. ‘ She’d rounded out a bit since she’d stopped having children, and that illness of hers – her constant suffering on account of the children – had begun to clear up; well, it didn’t really clear up, but it was as though she’d come to after a bout of drunkenness, as though she’d recovered her senses and realized that God’s world was still there with all its delights, the world she’d forgotten about and had no idea of how to live in, God’s world, of which she knew absolutely nothing. “I mustn’t let it slip! Time flies, and one doesn’t get it back again!” I reckon that’s the way she thought, or rather felt, and it was impossible she could have thought or felt any differently. She’d been brought up to believe that there was only one thing in the world worth bothering about – love. She’d got married, she’d managed to get a bit of that love she’d been told about, but it was far from being what she’d been promised, what she’d expected, and it had brought her a lot of disillusionment and suffering; what was more, it had involved this quite unforeseen torment – children! This torment had worn her out. And then, thanks to those obliging doctors, she’d discovered it was possible to avoid having children. She’d been overjoyed, had tried the method for herself and had started to live again for the one thing she knew anything about – love. But love with a husband who was bemired in jealousy and rancour wouldn’t do. She began to imagine another love that was fresh and pure – that’s the way I figure it, at any rate. And then she started looking around her as though she were expecting something to come her way. I could see this, and I couldn’t help feeling uneasy. Quite often it would happen that as she carried on a conversation with me through the intermediary of others – that’s to say, she’d be talking to other people while really addressing herself to me – she’d come out boldly and half seriously, completely oblivious to the fact that an hour ago she’d said the exact opposite, with the statement that a mother’s cares are simply an illusion, a worthless one at that, and that it’s not worth sacrificing oneself for the sake of one ’s children when one’s young and able to enjoy life. She had started to devote less attention to the children, and no longer had such a desperate attitude towards them; she was spending more and more time on herself and on her appearance (though she tried to conceal the fact), on her amusements and also her accomplishments. She took up the piano again with enthusiasm – previously she had let it go completely. That was how it all started.’","He suddenly got up and sat down close by the window. “Excuse me,” he exclaimed, looking out intently for a few minutes. Then he sighed deeply and sat down opposite me again. His face had undergone a complete change: a sad look came into his eyes and a strange sort of smile curved his lips. “I am a little tired, but I will go on with my story. There is plenty of time left; it has not begun to grow light yet. Yes,” he began again, after he had lit a cigarette. “She grew fuller after she stopped bearing children, and her malady—the constant worriment over the children— began to disappear. It did not really disappear, but she awoke, as it were, from a drunken stupor; she began to remember and to see that there was a whole world, a divine world, with joys she had forgotten and in which she did not know how to live—a wonderful world which she did not understand at all! ‘ How to keep it from being wasted? Time is fleeting—it will not return.’ “Thus I imagined she thought, or rather felt, and indeed it would have been impossible for it to be otherwise. She had been educated to believe that in this world there is only one thing worthy of anyone’s attention—love. She had become married, she had got some notion of what this love was, but it was far from what had been promised, from what she expected. She had undergone the loss of many illusions; she had borne many sufferings, and then that unexpected torment—so many children! This agony had worn her out. And now, thanks to the obliging doctors, she had discovered that it was possible to avoid having children. She was glad; she made the experiment and began to live for the one thing she knew—love. But the enjoyment of love with a husband consumed with fiery passions of wrath and jealousy was not the kind she wanted. She began to picture to herself another, a more genuine, a newer kind of connection—at least that is what I imagine was the case. And so she began to look around, expecting something. “I noticed it and was deeply troubled. It kept happening all the time that she—talking as her habit was with me through the medium of others, talking with strangers but making her remarks for my ears— expressed herself boldly (never at all dreaming that she, an hour before, had said diametrically the opposite) and half seriously to the effect that maternal solicitude was a delusion, that there was no sense in sacrificing her life for her children, that she was still young and could still enjoy life. She now occupied herself less with the children, certainly with less untiring solicitude. She gave more and more attention to herself, to her external appearance (although she tried to keep it secret), to her pleasures, and to her accomplishments. She once more enthusiastically took up her piano, which she had entirely neglected. That was the beginning of the end.”"
"— Да, полюбуйся на то, что ты сделал, — сказала она, глядя в дверь, и всхлипнула. В двери стояла сестра с детьми. — Да, вот что ты сделал.","“Yes, look at what you did,” she said, looking at the door, and sobbed. At the door stood a sister with children. Yes, that's what you did.","‘“Yes, admire what you’ve done,” she said, looking towards the door, and she gave a sob. Her sister was standing in the doorway with the children. “Yes, there it is, there’s what you’ve done.”","“ ‘Yes . . . delight yourself in what you have done,’ she said, glancing at the door and sobbing. In the doorway stood her sister with the children. ‘Oh, what have you done?’"

"Оба не договорили… Началось то другое, чего он боялся, что разрывало сразу все, что они говорили. Я бросился к ней, все еще скрывая кинжал, чтобы он не помешал мне ударить ее в бок под грудью. Я выбрал это место с самого начала. В ту минуту, как я бросился к ней, он увидал, и, чего я никак не ждал от него, он схватил меня за руку и крикнул:","Both did not finish ... Something else began, which he was afraid of, which immediately tore apart everything that they said. I rushed towards her, still concealing my dagger so that it wouldn't stop me from stabbing her in the side under the breast. I chose this place from the very beginning. The moment I rushed to her, he saw, and, which I did not expect from him, he grabbed my hand and shouted:","‘Neither of them managed to finish what they were saying… That something else, the thing he was afraid of, the thing that blew all their words to kingdom come in one instant, began to happen. I rushed at her, still keeping the poniard hidden in case he tried to stop me plunging it into her side, under the breast. That was the spot I’d chosen right from the outset. In the very moment I attacked her, he saw what I was doing, and seized my arm – something I’d never expected he’d do – shouting: “Think what you’re doing!","Neither finished what they were saying. The something else which terrified him began. It swept away instantaneously all that they had to say. “I threw myself on her, still concealing the dagger in order that he might not prevent me from striking her in the side under the breast! I had chosen that spot at the very beginning. The instant I threw myself on her he saw my intent and, with an action I never expected from him, he seized me by the arm and cried: ‘Think what you ."
"— Ну, а как же вы сами сейчас рассказывали, как женатые люди на ярманке в Кунавине веселятся? — сказал я, не выдержав.","- Well, how did you yourself just now tell how married people have fun at the fair in Kunavin? I said, unable to bear it.",‘But what about that story you were telling us just then about those married men going on the spree in Kunavino?’ I could not resist asking.,"“But you were just telling how you married men enjoyed yourselves at the Fair at Kunavin,” said I, unable to restrain myself."
"— Какая же это любовь… любовь… любовь… освящает брак? — сказал он, запинаясь.","“What kind of love… love… love… sanctifies marriage?” he said, stammering.",‘What’s this love… love… love… that sanctifies marriage?’ he stammered.,"“What is that love . . . that love . . . which consecrates marriage?” he asked, stammering."
"Во время отсутствия господина с дамой в вагон вошло несколько новых лиц и в том числе высокий бритый морщинистый старик, очевидно купец, в ильковой шубе и суконном картузе с огромным козырьком. Купец сел против места дамы с адвокатом и тотчас же вступил в разговор с молодым человеком, по виду купеческим приказчиком, вошедшим в вагон тоже на этой станции.","During the absence of the gentleman and the lady, several new faces entered the carriage, including a tall, shaven, wrinkled old man, obviously a merchant, in an ilk fur coat and a cloth cap with a huge visor. The merchant sat down opposite the seat of the lady with the lawyer and immediately entered into a conversation with a young man who looked like a merchant's clerk, who also entered the carriage at this station.","During their absence several new passengers entered the carriage. They included a tall, clean-shaven old man whose face was creased all over in wrinkles; he was evidently a merchant, and he wore a polecat fur coat and a cloth cap that had an enormous peak. He sat down opposite the places temporarily vacated by the lawyer and the lady, and immediately launched into a conversation with a young man who looked like a salesclerk and who had also entered the carriage at this station.","During their absence, several new persons entered our carriage, among them a tall, closely shaven, wrinkled old man, evidently a merchant, wearing a coat of polecat fur and a cloth cap with a huge vizor. He sat down opposite the lawyer’s seat and immediately entered into conversation with a young man, apparently a merchant’s clerk, who entered the carriage at the same station."
"Виновата же была, разумеется, не она. Она была такая же, как и все, как большинство. Воспитана она была, как того требует положение женщины в нашем обществе, и поэтому как и воспитываются все без исключения женщины обеспеченных классов и как они не могут не воспитываться. Толкуют о каком-то новом женском образовании. Все пустые слова: образование женщины точно такое, какое должно быть при существующем не притворном, а истинном всеобщем взгляде на женщину.","It was not her fault, of course. She was just like everyone else, like most. She was brought up as required by the position of a woman in our society, and therefore, as all women of the wealthy classes, without exception, are brought up and how they cannot but be brought up. They are talking about some new female education. All empty words: the education of a woman is exactly what it should be with the existing, not feigned, but true universal view of a woman.","‘Needless to say, it wasn’t her fault. She was just like all women, or the majority of them, anyway. She’d been brought up in the way the situation of women in our society demands, the way in which all upper-class women without exception are and have to be brought up. You hear a lot of talk these days about a new type of education for women. That’s all hot air women’s education is exactly the way it ought to be, given the prevailing attitude towards women in our society – the real attitude, that is, not the pretended one.","“She was not to blame, of course. She was like all other women. She had been brought up in the way required by the role of women in our society, and therefore educated as all women of the leisure class are. “They talk nowadays about some newfangled method of female education. All idle words: the training of women is exactly what it must be in view of the notion of women universally held."
"— Да уж я не знаю как; только если равенство, так равенство. Если нашли, что сватовство унизительно, то уж это в тысячу раз больше. Там права и шансы равны, а здесь женщина или раба на базаре, или привада в капкан. Скажите какой-нибудь матушке или самой девушке правду, что она только тем и занята, чтобы ловить жениха. Боже, какая обида! А ведь они все только это и делают, и больше им делать нечего. И что ведь ужасно — это видеть занятых этим иногда совершенно молоденьких бедных невинных девушек. И опять, если бы это открыто делалось, а то все обман. «Ах, происхождение видов, как это интересно! Ах, Лиза очень интересуется живописью! А вы будете на выставке? Как поучительно! А на тройках, а спектакль, а симфония? Ах, как замечательно! Моя Лиза без ума от музыки. А вы почему не разделяете эти убеждения? А на лодках!..» А мысль одна: «Возьми, возьми меня, мою Лизу! Нет, меня! Ну, хоть попробуй!..» О мерзость! ложь! — заключил он и, допив последний чай, принялся убирать чашки и посуду.","“Yes, I don’t know how; only if equality, then equality. If you find that matchmaking is humiliating, then it is a thousand times more. There, rights and chances are equal, but here a woman is either a slave in the market, or a bait in a trap. Tell some mother or the girl herself the truth, that she is only busy with catching the groom. God, what a shame! But they all do just that, and they have nothing else to do. And what's terrible is to see sometimes completely young, poor, innocent girls busy with this. And again, if this were done openly, otherwise it would all be a hoax. “Ah, the origin of species, how interesting! Ah, Lisa is very interested in painting! Will you be at the exhibition? How instructive! And on triplets, and the performance, and the symphony? Ah, how wonderful! My Lisa is crazy about music. Why don't you share these beliefs? And on boats! ..” And there is only one thought: “Take, take me, my Lisa! I am not here! Well, at least try!..” Oh, the abomination! False! he concluded, and, having finished his last tea, he began to put away the cups and dishes.","‘I honestly don’t know: but if we’re going to have equality, then let’s have real equality. It may well be that matchmaking is a degrading business, but this is a thousand times more so. At least under the old system the rights possessed by both parties and their chances of making a decent match were equal, but nowadays a women is like a slave in a market or a piece of bait for a trap. Just you try to tell a mother or even the girl herself that all her activities are directed towards catching a husband. Dear Lord, what an insult! And yet that’s all they do, and they’ve nothing else with which to fill their time. What’s so awful is seeing even poor innocent young girls engaged in this activity. If only it were done out in the open, but no, it’s all trickery, deceit. “Ah, the origin of species, how interesting! Oh, Liza’s so interested in painting! And you’ll be going to the exhibition? How educational! And the troika rides, and the theatre, and the symphony concert? How wonderful! My Liza’s simply mad about music. Oh, do tell me why you don’t share these convictions! And boating, too…” And all the while there’s just one thought in her head: “Take me, take me, take my Liza! No, me! Go on, just for a trial!” Oh, horror! Lies!’ he concluded, and, drinking up what was left of the tea, set about clearing away the glasses and the rest of the tea things.","“Well, I can’t say exactly how; but if there is to be equality, then let it be equality. If the system of the matchmaker is considered humiliating, this is a thousand times more so! In the first case the rights and chances were equal, but in our method the woman is either a slave in a bazaar or the bait in the trap. Tell any mother or the girl herself the truth, that she is only occupied in husband-catching—my God, what an insult! But that is the truth and they have nothing else to do. And what is really dreadful is to see poor innocent young girls involved in all this. It wouldn’t be so bad if it were done openly, but it is all deception. ‘Ah, the origin of species, how interesting!’ ‘Lily is greatly interested in painting.’ ‘And will you be at the exhibition? How instructive!’ And the carriage rides and the theater and the symphony. ‘Oh, how remarkable!’ ‘My Lily is crazy about music!’ ‘And why don’t you share these views?’ And the boat rides. And always one thought: ‘Take me!’ ‘Take my Lily!’ ‘No, me!’ ‘Just try your luck!’ Oh, what vileness and falsehood!” he exclaimed, and, swallowing the last of his tea, proceeded to put away his utensils."
"— Вот Домострой живой, — сказала дама. — Какое дикое понятие о женщине и о браке!","“Here is Domostroy alive,” said the lady. “What a wild concept about a woman and about marriage!","‘A veritable walking Domostroy,’3 said the lady. ‘What a barbarous conception of woman and marriage!’",“The Domostroy2 come to life!” said the lady. “What savage notions of women and marriage!”
"— Та пучина заблуждения, в которой мы живем относительно женщин и отношений к ним. Да-с, не могу спокойно говорить про это, и не потому, что со мной случился этот эпизод, как он говорил, а потому, что с тех пор, как случился со мной этот эпизод, у меня открылись глаза, и я увидал все совсем в другом свете. Все навыворот, все навыворот!..","- The abyss of delusion in which we live regarding women and attitudes towards them. Yes, sir, I can’t calmly talk about it, and not because this episode happened to me, as he said, but because since this episode happened to me, my eyes have been opened, and I have seen everything in a completely different light. All over, all over!","‘The abyss of error we live in regarding women and our relations with them. It’s no good, I just can’t talk calmly about it. It’s not merely because of that episode, as the other gentleman called it, but because ever since I went through it my eyes have been opened and I’ve seen everything in a completely new light. Everything’s been turned inside out, it’s all inside out!…’","“The abyss of error in which we live concerning women and our relations to them. I cannot talk with calm about it, and the reason I cannot is the episode which took place in my life. But ever since that occurred, my eyes have been opened, and I have seen everything in an entirely different light—exactly the opposite . . . exactly the opposite.”"
"— Вот такой-то свиньей я и жил, — продолжал он опять прежним тоном. — Хуже же всего было то, что, живя этой скверной жизнью, я воображал, что потому, что я не соблазняюсь другими женщинами, что поэтому я живу честной семейной жизнью, что я нравственный человек и что я ни в чем не виноват, а что если у нас происходят ссоры, то виновата она, ее характер.","“That’s the kind of pig I lived,” he continued again in the same tone. “The worst of all was that, while living this nasty life, I imagined that because I was not tempted by other women, that therefore I lived an honest family life, that I was a moral person and that I was not to blame for anything, but that if we have quarrels, then she is to blame, her character.","‘So that’s the sort of pig’s existence I led,’ he resumed, in the same tone of voice. ‘ And the worst of it was that, living in this filthy way, I imagined that because I didn’t allow myself to be tempted by other women, I was leading a decent, married life, that I was a man of upright morality with not a stain of guilt on my conscience, and that if we had quarrels, it was her fault, the fault of her character.","“Thus I lived like a pig,” he continued, in his former tone. “The worst of it was that while I was living this vile life, I imagined that, because I did not commit adultery with other women, I was leading a perfectly virtuous family life, that I was a moral and blameless man, that if we had our quarrels she was to blame—it was her character!"
"— Вася, что ты, что с тобой?","- Vasya, what are you, what is the matter with you?",what’s wrong with you?”,"She merely stammered, ‘Vasya! What is it? What is the matter with you?’"
"В середине речи дамы позади меня послышался звук как бы прерванного смеха или рыдания, и, оглянувшись, мы увидали моего соседа, седого одинокого господина с блестящими глазами, который во время разговора, очевидно интересовавшего его, незаметно подошел к нам. Он стоял, положив руки на спинку сиденья, и, очевидно, очень волновался: лицо его было красно и на щеке вздрагивал мускул.","In the middle of the lady’s speech, behind me, there was a sound of interrupted laughter or sobbing, and, looking around, we saw my neighbor, a gray-haired solitary gentleman with shining eyes, who, during a conversation that obviously interested him, imperceptibly approached us. He stood with his hands on the back of the seat, and was obviously very agitated: his face was red and a muscle twitched in his cheek.","The lady’s homily was interrupted half-way through by a sound that seemed to come from behind me and might have been a broken laugh or a sob. When we turned round, we saw my neighbour, the solitary, grey-haired man with the light in his eyes; he had evidently become interested in our conversation and had come closer to us without our noticing. He was standing up, his hands leaning on the back of his seat, and he was plainly in a state of great agitation. His face was red, and a muscle in one of his cheeks was twitching.","In the midst of the lady’s sentence, we heard a sound just behind me like an interrupted laugh or a sob, and looking around we saw my neighbor—the bright-eyed, gray-haired, solitary gentleman—who during the conversation, which had evidently interested him, had unobtrusively moved near. He was standing with his hand resting on the back of the seat. He was clearly very agitated; his face was red and the muscles of his cheek twitched."
— Разве я не вижу?,“Can't I see?,‘“Do you think I haven’t noticed?”,“ ‘But I see that you are!’
"К шести часам собрались гости, и явился и он во фраке с бриллиантовыми запонками дурного тона. Он держал себя развязно, на все отвечал поспешно с улыбочкой согласия и понимания, знаете, с тем особенным выражением, что все, что вы сделаете или скажете, есть то самое, чего он ожидал. Все, что было в нем непорядочного, все это я замечал теперь с особенным удовольствием, потому что это все должно было успокоить меня и показывать, что он стоял для моей жены на такой низкой ступени, до которой, как она и говорила, она не могла унизиться. Я теперь уже не позволял себе ревновать. Во-первых, я перемучался уже этой мукой, и мне надо было отдохнуть; во-вторых, я хотел верить уверениям жены и верил им. Но, несмотря на то, что я не ревновал, я все-таки был ненатурален с ним и с нею и во время обеда и первую половину вечера, пока не началась музыка. Я все еще следил за движениями и взглядами их обоих.","By six o'clock the guests had gathered, and he appeared in a tailcoat with diamond cufflinks in bad taste. He behaved casually, he answered everything hastily with a smile of consent and understanding, you know, with that special expression that everything you do or say is exactly what he expected. Everything that was dishonorable in him, I noticed all this now with particular pleasure, because all this was supposed to calm me and show that he stood for my wife at such a low level, to which, as she said, she could not humiliate yourself. I no longer allowed myself to be jealous. Firstly, I was already tormented by this torment, and I needed to rest; secondly, I wanted to believe the assurances of my wife and believed them. But, despite the fact that I was not jealous, I was still unnatural with him and with her and during dinner and the first half of the evening, until the music began. I was still following the movements and glances of both of them.","‘By six that evening the guests had all assembled, and he appeared wearing tails and a dicky with vulgar diamond studs on it. He was behaving in a free and easy manner, replying hastily to any question that was put to him, with an understanding, acquiescent smile – you know, the kind of expression that conveyed that everything others said or did was exactly what he’d been expecting. I noted all the things that were mauvais ton about him now with especial satisfaction, because they helped to put my mind at rest and demonstrate to me that he was so much my wife’s inferior that she would never be able, as she put it, to stoop that low. By now I’d stopped allowing myself to feel jealous. For one thing, I’d had a basinful of that particular torture, and I needed a rest; for another, I wanted to believe my wife’s assurances, and so I did believe them. But in spite of not being jealous, I couldn’t behave naturally towards either of them, and this was true both during dinner and throughout all the earlier part of the evening, before the music started. I kept watching their movements, their looks.","“At six o’clock the guests had arrived, and he also, in evening dress with diamond shirt studs of bad taste. He was completely at ease, quickly answered all questions with a smile of sympathy and appreciation—you know what I mean, with that peculiar expression that signifies that everything you say or do is exactly what he expected. I noticed now with special satisfaction everything about him that would give an unfavorable impression, because all this served to calm me and to prove that he stood in my wife’s eyes on such a low level that, as she said, she could not possibly descend to it. I did not allow myself to be jealous. In the first place, I had already been through the pangs of that torment and needed rest; in the second place, I wanted to have faith in my wife’s assurances, and I did believe in them. But in spite of the fact that I was not jealous, still I was not at ease with either of them, and during the dinner and the first half of the evening before the music began, I kept watching their motions and glances all the time."
"Когда люди говорят, что они в припадке бешенства не помнят того, что они делают, — это вздор, неправда. Я все помнил и ни на секунду не переставал помнить. Чем сильнее я разводил сам в себе пары своего бешенства, тем ярче разгорался во мне свет сознания, при котором я не мог не видеть всего того, что я делал. Всякую секунду я знал, что я делаю. Не могу сказать, чтобы я знал вперед, что я буду делать, но в ту секунду, как я делал, даже, кажется, несколько вперед, я знал, что я делаю, как будто для того, чтоб возможно было раскаяться, чтоб я мог себе сказать, что я мог остановиться. Я знал, что я ударяю ниже ребер и что кинжал войдет. В ту минуту, как я делал это, я знал, что я делаю нечто ужасное, такое, какого я никогда не делал и которое будет иметь ужасные последствия. Но сознание это мелькнуло как молния, и за сознанием тотчас же следовал поступок. И поступок сознавался с необычайной яркостью. Я слышал и помню мгновенное противодействие корсета и еще чего-то и потом погружение ножа в мягкое. Она схватилась руками за кинжал, обрезала их, но не удержала. Я долго потом, в тюрьме, после того как нравственный переворот совершился во мне, думал об этой минуте, вспоминал, что мог, и соображал. Помню на мгновение, только на мгновение, предварявшее поступок, страшное сознание того, что я убиваю и убил женщину, беззащитную женщину, мою жену. Ужас этого сознания я помню и потому заключаю и даже вспоминаю смутно, что, воткнув кинжал, я тотчас же вытащил его, желая поправить сделанное и остановить. Я секунду стоял неподвижно, ожидая, что будет, можно ли поправить. Она вскочила на ноги, вскрикнула:","When people say that in a fit of rage they do not remember what they are doing, this is nonsense, not true. I remembered everything and never stopped remembering for a second. The more strongly I aroused in myself the vapors of my rage, the brighter the light of consciousness flared up in me, in which I could not but see everything that I was doing. Every second I knew what I was doing. I can’t say that I knew in advance what I would do, but at the moment I did it, even, it seems, a little ahead, I knew what I was doing, as if in order to repent, so that I could say to myself that I could stop. I knew that I was hitting below the ribs and that the dagger would go in. The minute I did this, I knew that I was doing something terrible, something I had never done before, and which would have terrible consequences. But this consciousness flashed like lightning, and an act immediately followed the consciousness. And the deed was recognized with extraordinary brilliance. I heard and remember the instant reaction of the corset and something else, and then the dipping of the knife into the soft. She grabbed the dagger with her hands, cut them off, but did not hold. For a long time later, in prison, after the moral upheaval had taken place in me, I thought about that moment, remembered what I could, and thought. I remember for a moment, only for a moment, preceding the act, the terrible consciousness that I am killing and have killed a woman, a defenseless woman, my wife. I remember the horror of this consciousness, and therefore I conclude and even vaguely remember that, having stuck the dagger in, I immediately pulled it out, wanting to correct what had been done and stop it. I stood motionless for a second, waiting for what would happen, if it could be corrected. She jumped to her feet and cried out:","‘When people tell you they don’t remember what they did when they are in a mad fit of rage, don’t believe a word of it – it’s all lies, nonsense. I remembered everything afterwards, and I’ve never ceased to remember it for one second. The more steam my rage got up, the more brilliantly the light of consciousness flared within me, making it impossible for me not to be aware of everything I was doing. I can’t claim that I knew in advance what I was going to do, but I was aware of each action I took at the moment I performed it, and sometimes, I think, a little before. It was as if it had been arranged like this so I could repent, so I could tell myself I was capable of stopping if I wanted to. I knew that I was striking her with the poniard under the ribs, and that it was going to go in. At the moment I did it, I knew I was doing something horrific, something the like of which I had never done before, and that it was going to have terrible consequences. But that awareness came and went like a flash of lightning, and was instantly followed by the act itself. I was blindingly aware of that act, too. I felt – I can remember it now – the momentary resistance of her corset, and of something else as well, and then the way the poniard sank into something soft. She grabbed at the poniard with both hands, lacerating them on the blade, but she couldn’t stop it from going in. For a long time afterwards, in prison, when a change of heart had taken place in me, I used to think about that moment, remembering what I could of it, and weighing it up in my mind. I would remember that for a split-second – only a split-second, mind you – before I did what I did, I had a terrible awareness that I was killing, that I’d killed a woman, a defenceless woman, my wife. I remember the horror of that awareness even now, and putting two and two together I think that once I’d stuck the poniard into her, I must have pulled it out again (I even have a dim memory of doing this), in an attempt to set right what I’d done and put a stop to it all. For a second I stood without moving, waiting to see what would happen, and whether everything was going to be all right again. She leapt to her feet and screamed: “Nurse, he’s killed me!”","“When men say that in an attack of madness they don’t remember what they did, it is all false, all nonsense. I remember every detail, and not for one second did I fail to remember. The more violently I kindled within me the flames of my madness, the more brightly burned the light of consciousness, so that I could not fail to see all that I did. I knew every second what I was doing. I cannot say that I knew in advance what I was going to do, but at the instant I did anything, and perhaps a little before, I knew what I was up to—as if for the sake of being able to repent, of being able to say to myself, ‘I might have stopped.’ I knew that I struck below the ribs and that the dagger would penetrate. At the moment I was doing this, I knew that I was doing something, something awful, something I had never done before, something which would have awful consequences. But this consciousness flashed through my mind like lightning and was instantly followed by the deed. The deed made itself real with unexampled clearness. I felt, I remember, the momentary resistance of her corset and of something else, and then the sinking of the blade into the soft parts of her body. She seized the dagger with her hands, cutting them, but she could not stop me. “Afterward, in the prison, while a moral revolution was working itself out in me, I thought much about that moment—what I might have done—and I thought it all over. I remember that a second, only a second, before the deed was accomplished, I had the terrible realization that I was killing a woman—a defenseless woman—my wife. I recall the horror of this awareness, and therefore I conclude—and indeed I dimly remember— that, having plunged the dagger in, I immediately withdrew it with the impulse to remedy what I had done. I stood motionless for a second, waiting to see what would happen—and whether I might undo what I had done. “She rose to her feet, and shrieked: ‘Nurse, he has killed me!’"
"— Коли рассказывать, то надо рассказывать все с начала: надо рассказать, как и отчего я женился и каким я был до женитьбы.","- If you tell, then you need to tell everything from the beginning: you need to tell how and why I got married and what I was like before marriage.","Then, rubbing his face in his hands, he began: ‘If I’m going to tell you, I’ll have to start at the beginning, and tell you how and why I got married, and what I was like before my marriage.","“If I tell you, I must begin at the very beginning. I must tell you how and why I got married, and what I was before I married."

Сосед мой, нервный господин с блестящими глазами, очевидно, тоже заинтересовался и, не вставая с места, прислушивался.","The train, moving faster and faster, rumbled in skirmishes, and it was hard for me to hear, but it was interesting, and I moved closer. My neighbor, a nervous gentleman with sparkling eyes, was obviously also interested and, without getting up, listened.","As the train began to gather speed it kept rattling over points, and it was not easy to hear what he was saying. I was interested, however, and I shifted my seat so as to be closer to him. The interest of my neighbour, the nervous man with the light in his eyes, had also plainly been aroused, and he continued to listen while staying where he was.","The train, moving along more and more rapidly, thundered so loudly I could hardly hear. But since the discussion interested me, I moved to a nearer seat. My neighbor, the nervous bright-eyed gentleman, was also evidently much interested, and he listened, but without moving from his place."

"— Они играли Крейцерову сонату Бетховена. Знаете ли вы первое престо? Знаете?! — вскрикнул он. — У!.. Страшная вещь эта соната. Именно эта часть. И вообще страшная вещь музыка. Что это такое? Я не понимаю. Что такое музыка? Что она делает? И зачем она делает то, что она делает? Говорят, музыка действует возвышающим душу образом, — вздор, неправда! Она действует, страшно действует, я говорю про себя, но вовсе не возвышающим душу образом. Она действует ни возвышающим, ни принижающим душу образом, а раздражающим душу образом. Как вам сказать? Музыка заставляет меня забывать себя, мое истинное положение, она переносит меня в какое-то другое, не свое положение: мне под влиянием музыки кажется, что я чувствую то, чего я, собственно, не чувствую, что я понимаю то, чего не понимаю, что могу то, чего не могу. Я объясняю это тем, что музыка действует, как зевота, как смех: мне спать не хочется, но я зеваю, глядя на зевающего, смеяться не о чем, но я смеюсь, слыша смеющегося.","They were playing Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata. Do you know the first presto? Do you know?! he cried. “U!.. This sonata is a terrible thing. It is this part. And in general, a terrible thing is music. What it is? I don't understand. What is music? What she does? And why does she do what she does? They say that music works in a way that uplifts the soul—nonsense, not true! It acts, it acts terribly, I'm talking about myself, but not at all in an uplifting way. It acts neither in an uplifting nor in a degrading way, but in a way that irritates the soul. How can you tell? Music makes me forget myself, my true position, it takes me to some other, not my own position: under the influence of music it seems to me that I feel what I don’t really feel, that I understand what I don’t understand that I can do what I can't. I explain this by the fact that music acts like a yawn, like laughter: I don’t want to sleep, but I yawn, looking at the yawner, there is nothing to laugh about, but I laugh when I hear the laugher.","‘They played Beethoven’s “Kreutzer Sonata”. Do you know its first movement, the presto? You know it?’ he burst out. ‘ Ah! It’s a fearful thing, that sonata. Especially that movement. And music in general’s a fearful thing. What is it? I don’t know. What is music? What does it do to us? And why does it do to us what it does? People say that music has an uplifting effect on the soul: what rot! It isn’t true. If s true that it has an effect, it has a terrible effect on me, at any rate, but it has nothing to do with any uplifting of the soul. Its effect on the soul is neither uplifting nor degrading – it merely irritates me. How can I put it? Music makes me forget myself, my true condition, it carries me off into another state of being, one that isn’t my own: under the influence of music I have the illusion of feeling things I don’t really feel, of understanding things I don’t understand, being able to do things I’m not able to do. I explain this by the circumstance that the effect produced by music is similar to that produced by yawning or laughter. I may not be sleepy, but I yawn if I see someone else yawning; I may have no reason for laughing, but I laugh if I see someone else laughing.","“They played Beethoven’s Kreutzer Sonata,”11 he finally went on to say. “Do you know the first Presto? You do know it?” he cried. “Ugh! That sonata is a terrible thing. And especially that movement! Music in general is a terrible thing. I cannot comprehend it. What is music? What does it do? And why does it have the effect it has? They say music has the effect of elevating the soul—rubbish! Nonsense! It has its effect, it has a terrible effect—I am speaking about its effect on me—but not at all of elevating the soul. Its effect is neither to elevate nor to degrade but to excite. How can I explain to to you? Music makes me forget myself, my real situation. It transports me into a state that is not my natural one. Under the influence of music it seems to me that I feel what I do not really feel, that I understand what I do not really understand, that I can do what I can’t do. I explain this by the fact that music acts like gaping or laughing: I am not sleepy but I gape, looking at anyone else who is gaping; I have nothing to laugh at, but I laugh when I hear others laugh."
"Он ничего не сказал и ушел. Я встал, запер дверь и, достав папироски и спичку, стал курить. Я не докурил папироски, как меня схватил и повалил сон. Я спал, верно, часа два. Помню, я видел во сне, что мы дружны с ней, поссорились, но миримся, и что немножко что-то мешает, но мы дружны. Меня разбудил стук в дверь. «Это полиция, — подумал я, просыпаясь. — Ведь я убил, кажется. А может быть, это она, и ничего не было». В дверь еще постучались. Я ничего не отвечал, решая вопрос: было это или не было? Да, было. Я вспомнил сопротивление корсета и погружение ножа, и мороз пробежал по спине. «Да, было. Да, теперь надо и себя», — сказал я себе. Но я говорил это и знал, что я не убью себя. Однако я встал и взял опять в руки револьвер. Но странное дело: помню, как прежде много раз я был близок к самоубийству, как в тот день даже, на железной дороге, мне это легко казалось, легко именно потому, что я думал, как я этим поражу ее. Теперь я никак не мог не только убить себя, но и подумать об этом. «Зачем я это сделаю?» — спрашивал я себя, и ответа не было. В дверь постучались еще. «Да, прежде надо узнать, кто это стучится. Успею еще». Я положил револьвер и покрыл его газетой. Я подошел к двери и отодвинул задвижку. Это была сестра жены, добрая, глупая вдова.","He didn't say anything and left. I got up, locked the door, and, taking out cigarettes and a match, began to smoke. I had not finished smoking my cigarettes, when sleep seized me and threw me down. I slept, right, two hours. I remember I saw in a dream that we were friends with her, we quarreled, but we put up, and that something was a little disturbing, but we were friendly. I was awakened by a knock on the door. “This is the police,” I thought, waking up. “After all, I killed, it seems. Or maybe it's her, and nothing happened. There was still a knock on the door. I didn't answer anything, solving the question: was it or wasn't it? Yes it was. I remembered the resistance of the corset and the sinking of the knife, and a chill ran down my spine. ""Yes it was. Yes, now you need yourself, too,” I said to myself. But I said it and I knew that I would not kill myself. However, I got up and picked up the revolver again. But a strange thing: I remember how many times before I was close to suicide, how that day, even on the railway, it seemed easy to me, easy precisely because I thought how I would amaze her with this. Now I could not only kill myself, but even think about it. ""Why would I do this?"" I asked myself, and there was no answer. There was another knock on the door. “Yes, first you need to find out who it is knocking. I can still do it."" I put down the revolver and covered it with newspaper. I went to the door and pushed back the latch. She was the wife's sister, a kind, stupid widow.","‘He made no reply, and went away. I got up, locked the door, found my cigarettes and matches, and had a smoke. I’d hardly finished my cigarette when sleep overcame me and rendered me senseless. I remember I dreamed that she and I were on friendly terms again, that we’d had a quarrel but had made it up; we still had a few outstanding differences, but we were friends once more. I was woken by a knocking at the door. “That’ll be the police!” I thought. “After all, I’ve just committed a murder, I think. Or maybe it’s her, and nothing has happened.” There was more knocking. I didn’t go to see who it was, I was trying to make up my mind whether it had all really happened or not. Yes, it had. I had a memory of her corset’s resistance, of the way the poniard had sunk into her, and a chill ran down my spine. “Yes, it happened, all right,” I said to myself. “And now it’s my turn.” But even as I silently formed these words, I knew I wasn’t going to kill myself. It was a strange thing: I remembered how many times before I’d been on the point of committing suicide; even that day in the train it had seemed easy to me, easy because I’d thought of how it would put the fear of God into her. Now, however, not only was I unable to kill myself – nothing could have been further from my thoughts. “Why should I?” I asked myself, and there was no reply. The knocking came again. “Right,” I said to myself. “The first thing I must do is find out who that is. I’m not in any hurry.” I put the revolver back on the desk and covered it with a newspaper. Then I went to the door and undid the latch. It was my wife’s sister, that kind-hearted, brainless widow.","“He said nothing, but went out. I got up, closed the door, got my cigarettes and matches, and began to smoke. I had not finished smoking my cigarette before drowsiness seized me and overcame me. I must have slept two hours. I remember I dreamed that she and I were friends, that we had quarreled but had made up, that some trifle had stood in our way but still we were friends. “A knock on the door awakened me. “ ‘It is the police,’ I thought as I woke. ‘I must have killed her! But maybe it is she herself and nothing has happened.’ “The knocking at the door was repeated. I did not answer, but kept trying to decide the question. ‘Had all that really taken place or not?’ Yes, it had. I remembered the resistance of the corset and the sinking of the dagger, and a cold chill ran down my back. ‘Yes, it is true. Yes, now I must have my turn,’ I said to myself. But though I said this I knew I would not kill myself. Nevertheless, I got up and once more took the revolver into my hand. But, strange as it may seem, I remember that many times before I had been near suicide—as, for instance, that very day on the railroad train—and it had seemed to me very easy, for by that I could fill her with consternation. “Now I could not kill myself or think of such a thing. ‘Why should I do it?’ I asked myself, and there was no answer. “The knocking continued at the door. “ ‘Yes, first I must find out who is knocking. I shall have time enough afterward . . .’ “I laid the revolver down and covered it with a newspaper. I went to the door and drew back the bolt. It was my wife’s sister, a good but stupid widow."
"Она, музыка, сразу, непосредственно переносит меня в то душевное состояние, в котором находился тот, кто писал музыку. Я сливаюсь с ним душою и вместе с ним переношусь из одного состояния в другое, но зачем я это делаю, я не знаю. Ведь тот, кто писал хоть бы Крейцерову сонату, — Бетховен, ведь он знал, почему он находился в таком состоянии, — это состояние привело его к известным поступкам, и потому для него это состояние имело смысл, для меня же никакого. И потому музыка только раздражает, не кончает. Ну, марш воинственный сыграют, солдаты пройдут под марш, и музыка дошла; сыграли плясовую, я проплясал, музыка дошла; ну, пропели мессу, я причастился, тоже музыка дошла, а то только раздражение, а того, что надо делать в этом раздражении, — нет. И оттого музыка так страшно, так ужасно иногда действует. В Китае музыка государственное дело. И это так и должно быть. Разве можно допустить, чтобы всякий, кто хочет, гипнотизировал бы один другого или многих и потом бы делал с ними что хочет. И главное, чтобы этим гипнотизером был первый попавшийся безнравственный человек.","She, the music, immediately, directly transfers me to the state of mind in which the one who wrote the music was. I merge with him in soul and together with him I am transferred from one state to another, but why I do this, I do not know. After all, the one who wrote at least the Kreutzer Sonata, Beethoven, he knew why he was in such a state, this state led him to certain actions, and therefore this state made sense for him, but none for me. And because the music only irritates, does not finish. Well, they will play a warlike march, the soldiers will march, and the music has reached; they played a dance, I danced, the music came; well, they sang a mass, I took communion, the music also reached me, otherwise it was only irritation, but there is nothing to do in this irritation. And that is why music is so terrifying, sometimes it works so terribly. In China, music is a state affair. And that's the way it should be. Is it possible to admit that anyone who wants to hypnotize one another or many and then do with them what he wants. And most importantly, this hypnotist should be the first immoral person who comes across.","‘Music carries me instantly and directly into the state of consciousness that was experienced by its composer. My soul merges with his, and together with him I’m transported from one state of consciousness into another; yet why this should be, I’ve no idea. I mean, take the man who wrote the “Kreutzer Sonata”, Beethoven: he knew why he was in that state of mind. It was that state of mind which led him to perform certain actions, and so it acquired a special significance for him, but none whatever for me. And that’s why that kind of music’s just an irritant – because it doesn’t lead anywhere. A military band plays a march, say: the soldiers march in step, and the music’s done its work. An orchestra plays a dance tune, I dance, and the music’s done its work. A Mass is sung, I take communion, and once again the music’s done its work. But that other kind of music’s just an irritation, an excitement, and the action the excitement’s supposed to lead to simply isn’t there! That’s why it’s such a fearful thing, why it sometimes has such a horrible effect. In China, music’s an affair of state. And that’s the way it ought to be. Can it really be allowable for anyone who feels like it to hypnotize another person, or many other persons, and then do what he likes with them? Particularly if the hypnotist is just the first unscrupulous individual who happens to come along?","“Music instantaneously transports me into that mental condition in which he who composed it found himself. I blend my soul with his, and with him I am transported from one mood to another. But I cannot tell why this is so. For instance, he who composed the Kreutzer Sonata— Beethoven—he knew why he was in that mood. That mood impelled him to do certain things; therefore that mood meant something for him, but it means nothing for me. And that is why music excites and does not bring to any conclusion. When they play a military march, the soldiers move forward under its strains and the music accomplishes something. They play dance music and I dance, and the music accomplishes something. They perform a mass, I take the sacrament; again the music accomplishes its purpose. But in other cases there is only excitement, and it is impossible to tell what to do in this state of mind. And that is why music is so awesome, why it sometimes has such a terrifying effect. In China, music is regulated by government, and this is as it should be. Is it permissible that just anyone at all can hypnotize another person, or many persons, and then do with them what he pleases? And especially if this hypnotizer happens to be the first immoral man that comes along?"
"Он замолчал и раза два издал свои странные звуки, которые теперь уже совсем похожи были на сдержанные рыдания. Мы подходили к станции.","He fell silent and once or twice uttered his strange sounds, which now were quite similar to restrained sobs. We approached the station.","For a while he said nothing, but made his peculiar noises a couple of times. Now they really did sound like stifled sobs. The train was approaching a station.",He stopped speaking and twice he gave vent to those strange sounds which this time were more like repressed sobs. We were approaching a station.
"— Да вот как бы не погиб род человеческий! — сказал он злобно-иронически, как бы ожидая этого знакомого ему и недобросовестного возражения. — Проповедуй воздержание от деторождения во имя того, чтобы английским лордам всегда можно было обжираться, — это можно. Проповедуй воздержание от деторождения во имя того, чтобы больше было приятности, — это можно; а заикнись только о том, чтобы воздерживаться от деторождения во имя нравственности, — батюшки, какой крик: род человеческий как бы не прекратился оттого, что десяток-другой хочет перестать быть свиньями. Впрочем, извините. Мне неприятен этот свет, можно закрыть? — сказал он, указывая на фонарь.","- Yes, that's how the human race would not perish! he said maliciously ironically, as if expecting this familiar and unscrupulous objection. “Preach abstinence from childbearing in order that the English lords may always be allowed to overeat—that is possible. Preach abstinence from childbearing in order to have more pleasantness - this is possible; but just hint at abstaining from childbearing in the name of morality - fathers, what a cry: the human race, as it were, has not stopped because a dozen or two want to stop being pigs. However, sorry. I don't like this light, can I close it? he said, pointing to the lantern.","As long as the human race doesn’t perish!’ he said with malevolent irony, as if he had been expecting this response as a familiar one, made in bad faith. ‘ To preach that one must abstain from procreation so that the English lords may continue to gorge themselves at their ease… that’s all right. To preach that one must abstain from procreation in order to make the world a more agreeable place to live in… that’s all right, too. But just try to insinuate that one ought to abstain from procreation in the name of morality… God in heaven, what an uproar will ensue! Is the human race going to disappear from the face of the earth just because a couple of dozen men don’t want to go on living like pigs? But I’m sorry, excuse me. The light’s getting in my eyes – do you mind if we pull the shade over it?’ he said, pointing to the lamp.","“Well, why shouldn’t the human race perish?” he asked, with a touch of savage bitterness, as if he were expecting my unfair reply and as if he had heard it before. “Preach abstinence from procreation so that English lords may gormandize, and that’s fine! Preach abstinence from procreation for the sake of giving a greater pleasure, and that’s fine! But try to persuade people to refrain from procreation in the name of morality—ye gods, what an outcry! The human race would not be extinguished by an attempt to keep men from being swine.” Then, pointing to the lamp, he continued, “Excuse me but this light bothers me. May I shade it?” I said that it didn’t matter to me, and then—hastily, as in everything he did—he stepped up on the seat and pulled the woolen shade down over the lamp."
"Ведь вы подумайте, что бы должно быть и что есть. Должно бы быть то, что, когда в общество к моей сестре, дочери вступит такой господин, я, зная его жизнь, должен подойти к нему, отозвать в сторону и тихо сказать: «Голубчик, ведь я знаю, как ты живешь, как проводишь ночи и с кем. Тебе здесь не место. Здесь чистые, невинные девушки. Уйди!» Так должно бы быть; а есть то, что, когда такой господин является и танцует, обнимая, ее, с моей сестрой, дочерью, мы ликуем, если он богат и с связями. Авось он удостоит после Ригольбош и мою дочь. Если даже и остались следы, нездоровье, — ничего. Нынче хорошо лечат.

It should be that when such a gentleman enters the company of my sister, daughter, I, knowing his life, should go up to him, take him aside and quietly say: “My dear, I know how you live, how you spend nights and with whom. You don't belong here. There are pure, innocent girls here. Get out!"" That's the way it should be; and there is that when such a gentleman appears and dances, embracing her, with my sister, daughter, we rejoice if he is rich and well-connected. Perhaps he will honor Rigolbosch and my daughter after. Even if there are traces, ill health, nothing. They are being treated well. How, I know, several girls of high society are given away by their parents with delight for syphilitics. O! oh abomination! May the time come when this abomination and falsehood will be exposed!","‘Just give some thought for a moment to the way things ought to be and the way things actually are. This is the way things ought to be: when one of these gentlemen enters into relations with my sister or my daughter, I go up to him, take him aside and say to him quietly: “My dear fellow, I know the sort of life you lead, how you spend your nights and who you spend them with. This is no place for you. The girls in this house are pure and innocent. Be off with you!” That’s how it ought to be. Now how things actually are is that when one of these gentlemen appears and starts dancing with my sister or my daughter, putting his arms round her, we rejoice, as long as he’s rich and has connections. Always supposing, of course, that after Rigolboche4 he considers my daughter good enough for him. Even if there are consequences, an illness… it doesn’t matter. They can cure anything nowadays. Good heavens, yes, I can think of several girls from the highest social circles whose parents enthusiastically married them off to syphilitics. Ugh, how vile! But the time will come when all that filth and deception will be shown for what it is!’","how charming we are! “Just think what ought to be and what is! It ought to be that when such a gentleman comes into the society of my sister or my daughter, I, knowing about his life, should draw him quietly to one side and say in a confidential whisper, ‘I know exactly how you are living, how you spend your nights and with whom. This is no place for you. These are pure, innocent women and girls. Please go.’ “So it ought to be. But in reality, when such a man makes his appearance or when he dances with my sister or my daughter in his arms, we rejoice if he is rich and well connected. Perhaps he will honor my daughter after Rigolboche.4 Even if traces of his disease remain, it is of no consequence; the cure is easy nowadays. I know that some girls of the highest society have been given by their parents with enthusiasm to men who have certain diseases. Oh, what rottenness!

"Выходит, что плотская любовь — это спасительный клапан. Не достигло теперь живущее поколение человечества цели, то не достигло оно только потому, что в нем есть страсти, и сильнейшая из них — половая. А есть половая страсть, и есть новое поколение, стало быть, и есть возможность достижения цели в следующем поколении. Не достигло и то, опять следующее, и так до тех пор, пока не достигнется цель, не исполнится пророчество, не соединятся люди воедино. А то ведь что бы вышло? Если допустить, что бог сотворил людей для достижения известной цели, и сотворил бы их или смертными, без половой страсти, или вечными. Если бы они были смертны, но без половой страсти, то вышло бы что? То, что они пожили бы и, не достигнув цели, умерли бы; а чтобы достигнуть цели, богу надо бы сотворять новых людей. Если же бы они были вечны, то положим (хотя это и труднее тем же людям, а не новым поколениям исправлять ошибки и приближаться к совершенству), положим, они бы достигли после многих тысяч лет цели, но тогда зачем же они? Куда ж их деть? Именно так, как есть, лучше всего… Но, может быть, вам не нравится эта форма выражения, и вы эволюционист? То и тогда выходит то же самое. Высшая порода животных — людская, для того чтобы удержаться в борьбе с другими животными, должна сомкнуться воедино, как рой пчел, а не бесконечно плодиться; должна так же, как пчелы, воспитывать бесполых, то есть опять должна стремиться к воздержанию, а никак не к разжиганию похоти, к чему направлен весь строй нашей жизни. — Он помолчал. — Род человеческий прекратится? Да неужели кто-нибудь, как бы он ни смотрел на мир, может сомневаться в этом? Ведь это так же несомненно, как смерть. Ведь по всем учениям церковным придет конец мира, и по всем учениям научным неизбежно то же самое. Так что же странного, что по учению нравственному выходит то же самое?","It turns out that carnal love is a saving valve. The living generation of humanity has not reached the goal now, it has not reached it only because there are passions in it, and the strongest of them is sexual. And there is sexual passion, and there is a new generation, therefore, there is the possibility of achieving the goal in the next generation. Not reached and that, again the next, and so on until the goal is reached, the prophecy is fulfilled, people are united together. And then what would happen? If we assume that God created people to achieve a certain goal, and would have created them either mortal, without sexual passion, or eternal. If they were mortal, but without sexual passion, what would happen? That they would live and, not having reached the goal, would die; and in order to achieve the goal, God would have to create new people. If they were eternal, then suppose (although it is more difficult for the same people, and not for new generations to correct mistakes and approach perfection), suppose they would reach their goal after many thousands of years, but then why should they? Where are they to go? Just the way it is, the best... But maybe you don't like this form of expression, and you are an evolutionist? And then the same thing comes out. The highest breed of animals - human, in order to stay in the fight with other animals, must close together like a swarm of bees, and not endlessly multiply; should, like bees, educate the sexless, that is, again should strive for abstinence, and not at all for inciting lust, to which the whole structure of our life is directed. He paused. Will the human race end? Can anyone, no matter how he looks at the world, doubt this? It is as certain as death. After all, according to all the teachings of the Church, the end of the world will come, and according to all scientific teachings, the same is inevitable. So why is it strange that according to moral teaching the same thing comes out?","‘The result is that carnal love has become a safety valve. If the present generation of men hasn’t yet attained its goal, that’s merely because it has passions, the strongest of which is the sexual one. And since that passion exists, a new generation also exists, and thus a possibility of the goal being attained in the next generation. If this generation doesn’t manage to do it, there will always be another one to follow it, and so it will continue until the goal has been attained and men have been united with one another. What would things be like if this were not the case? Imagine if God had created human beings in order to achieve a certain goal and had created them either mortal, but without the sex instinct, or immortal. If they’d been made mortal, but without the sex instinct, what would the result have been? They would have lived for a while, and failed to attain their goal; in order to achieve his aim, God would have had to create a new human race. If, on the other hand, they’d been created immortal, let us suppose (though it would be more difficult for beings of this sort to correct the error of their ways and approach perfection than it would for new generations to do so) that after many thousands of years they attained their goal… what good would they be then? What could be done with them? Things are still best the way they are at present… But perhaps you don’t care for that sort of an argument, perhaps you’re an evolutionist? The outcome’s still the same. In order to defend its interests in its struggle with the other animals, the highest form of animal life – the human race – has to gather itself into a unity, like a swarm of bees, and not reproduce infinitely: like the bees, it must raise sexless individuals, that’s to say it must strive for continence, not the excitement of lust, towards which the entire social organization of our lives is directed.’ He fell silent for a moment. ‘ The human race disappear? Is there anyone, no matter how he views the world, who can doubt this? I mean, it’s just as little in dispute as death is. All the churches teach the end of the world, and all the sciences do the same. So what’s so strange about morality pointing to the same conclusion?’","“It follows that sexual love is the safety valve. If the human race has not as yet attained this aim, it is simply because there are passions, the strongest being sexual. But since there is sexual passion, a new generation comes along; and so there is always the possibility that the aim may be attained by some succeeding generation. But there will be generations until the aim is attained, until the prophecies are fulfilled, until all men are joined in unity. And then what would be the result? “If it be granted that God created men for the attainment of a certain end, then He must have created them mortal and without sexual passion, or immortal. If they were mortal but without sexual passion, then what would be the result? This: that they would live without attaining their aim, and then would die; to attain the aim, God would have to create new men. But if they were immortal, then let us suppose—although it is harder for the same men to correct mistakes and approach perfection than it is for new generations—let us suppose, I say, that they reached their goal after many thousand years. But why should they? What good would the rest of their lives be to them? It is better as it is! “But perhaps you do not agree with this reasoning. Perhaps you are an evolutionist. Even then it comes to the same thing. The highest genus of animals, men, in order to survive the conflict with other creatures, must band together like bees and not propagate irregularly; man must also, like the bees, nourish the sexless ones; in other words, man must struggle toward continence and never allow the kindling of carnal lust, to which the whole arrangement of our life is now directed.” He paused. “Will the human race come to an end? Can anyone who looks at the world as it is have the slightest doubt? Why, it is as certain as death! We find the end of the world foretold in all the teachings of the Church, and in all the teachings of science it is likewise shown to be inevitable."
"И подкравшись тихо, я вдруг отворил дверь. Помню выражение их лиц. Я помню это выражение, потому что выражение это доставило мне мучительную радость. Это было выражение ужаса. Этого-то мне и надо было. Я никогда не забуду выражение отчаянного ужаса, которое выступило в первую секунду на обоих их лицах, когда они увидали меня. Он сидел, кажется, за столом, но, увидав или услыхав меня, вскочил на ноги и остановился спиной к шкафу. На его лице было одно очень несомненное выражение ужаса. На ее лице было то же выражение ужаса, но с ним вместе было и другое. Если бы оно было одно, может быть, не случилось бы того, что случилось; но в выражении ее лица было, по крайней мере показалось мне в первое мгновенье, было еще огорченье, недовольство тем, что нарушили ее увлечение любовью и ее счастье с ним. Ей как будто ничего не нужно было, кроме того, чтобы ей не мешали быть счастливой теперь. То и другое выражение только мгновение держалось на их лицах. Выражение ужаса в его лице тотчас же сменилось выражением вопроса: можно лгать или нет? Если можно, то надо начинать. Если нет, то начнется еще что-то другое. Но что? Он вопросительно взглянул на нее. На ее лице выражение досады и огорчения сменилось, как мне показалось, когда она взглянула на него, заботою о нем.","And sneaking quietly, I suddenly opened the door. I remember the expression on their faces. I remember this expression because this expression gave me agonizing joy. It was an expression of horror. This is what I needed. I will never forget the expression of desperate horror that appeared in the first second on both their faces when they saw me. He seemed to be sitting at the table, but when he saw or heard me, he jumped to his feet and stopped with his back to the cupboard. There was one very unmistakable look of horror on his face. On her face was the same expression of horror, but with it was another. If it had been one, perhaps what happened would not have happened; but in the expression of her face there was, at least it seemed to me at first, there was still grief, dissatisfaction with the fact that her infatuation with love and her happiness with him had been violated. It was as if she didn’t need anything, except that they shouldn’t interfere with her being happy now. Both expressions lingered on their faces only for a moment. The expression of horror on his face was immediately replaced by an expression of the question: can I lie or not? If possible, then you should start. If not, then something else will start. But what? He looked at her questioningly. On her face, the expression of annoyance and chagrin changed, as it seemed to me, when she looked at him, to concern for him.","‘I crept quietly up to the door, and then suddenly opened it. I remember the look on their faces. I remember it because it gave me an excruciating joy. It was a look of terror. That was exactly what I wanted. I’ll never be able to forget the expression of desperate terror that came over both their faces in the first split-second they caught sight of me. As I remember it, he was sitting at the table, but when he saw me, or heard me, he leapt to his feet and froze with his back to the cupboard. His features wore a quite unmistakable look of terror. So did hers, but there was something else there, too. If all she had done was look terrified, it’s quite possible that what took place might never have happened; but in that facial expression of hers – at least that’s how it seemed to me in that first split-second – there was also a kind of annoyance, she looked as though she were put out at having her love-life interrupted, her happiness with him. It was as if all she cared about now was that no one should prevent her from being happy. These expressions stayed on their faces only for an instant. His terrified look quickly gave way to one that asked a question: was it going to be possible to lie or not? If it was, then they’d better start now. If it wasn’t, then something else was going to begin happening. But what? He threw her a questioning look. When she looked back at him, it seemed to me that her expression of annoyance had turned into one of concern for him.","“I suddenly threw open the door. I remember the expression on both of their faces. I remember that expression because it gave me a tormenting pleasure —it was an expression of complete horror! That was the very thing I needed! I shall never forget the expression of despairing horror which came into their faces the first second they saw me. He was seated at the table, but when he saw me or heard me he leaped to his feet and stood with his back against the sideboard. His face bore the unmistakable expression of terror. On her face also was an expression of terror, but there was something else blended with it. If it had not been for that something else, maybe what happened would not have happened. But in the expression of her face there was, or so there seemed to me at the first instant, a look of disappointment, of annoyance that her pleasure in his love and her enjoyment with him were interrupted. It was as if she wanted nothing else than to be left undisturbed in her present happiness. These expressions lingered but a moment on their faces. The look of terror on his face at once grew into a look which asked the question: ‘Is it possible to lie out of this or not? If it is possible, now is the time to begin. If not, then something else must be done—but what?’ “He looked questioningly at her. On her face the expression of annoyance and disappointment changed, it seemed to me, when she looked at him, into one of solicitude for him."
"— Да-с, загодя укорачивать надо женский пол, а то все пропадет.","“Yes, sir, the female gender must be shortened ahead of time, otherwise everything will be lost.","‘Yes, you have to rein them in early on, those womenfolk, otherwise it all goes to pot.’","“Yes,” said he, “we’ve got to restrain the female sex or else everything will go to ruin.”"

At the door I met a lawyer with a lady, talking animatedly about something as they walked.","Not expecting to hear anything of interest, I rose and left my seat with the aim of taking a stroll along the platform until it was time for the train to depart.

"— Ехать надо было тридцать пять верст на лошадях и восемь часов по чугунке. На лошадях ехать было прекрасно. Была морозная осенняя пора с ярким солнцем. Знаете, эта пора, когда шипы выпечатываются на масленой дороге. Дороги гладкие, свет яркий и воздух бодрящий. В тарантасе ехать было хорошо. Когда рассвело и я поехал, мне стало легче. Глядя на лошадей, на поля, на встречных, забывал, куда я еду. Иногда мне казалось, что я просто еду и что ничего того, что вызвало меня, ничего этого не было. И мне особенно радостно бывало так забываться. Когда же я вспоминал, куда я еду, я говорил себе: «Тогда видно будет, не думай». На середине дороги сверх того случилось событие, задержавшее меня в дороге и еще больше развлекшее меня: тарантас сломался, и надо было чинить его. Поломка эта имела большое значение тем, что она сделала то, что я приехал в Москву не в пять часов, как я рассчитывал, а в двенадцать часов и домой — в первом часу, так как я не попал на курьерский, а должен был уже ехать на пассажирском. Поездка за телегой, починка, расплата, чай на постоялом дворе, разговоры с дворником — все это еще больше развлекло меня. Сумерками все было готово, и я опять поехал, и ночью еще лучше было ехать, чем днем. Был молодой месяц, маленький мороз, еще прекрасная дорога, лошади, веселый ямщик, и я ехал и наслаждался, почти совсем не думая о том, что меня ожидает, или именно потому особенно наслаждался, что знал, что меня ожидает, и прощался с радостями жизни. Но это спокойное состояние мое, возможность подавлять свое чувство кончилось поездкой на лошадях. Как только я вошел в вагон, началось совсем другое. Этот восьмичасовой переезд в вагоне был для меня что-то ужасное, чего я не забуду во всю жизнь. Оттого ли, что, сев в вагон, я живо представил себя уже приехавшим, или оттого, что железная дорога так возбуждающе действует на людей, но только, с тех пор как я сел в вагон, я уже не мог владеть своим воображением, и оно не переставая с необычайной яркостью начало рисовать мне разжигающие мою ревность картины, одну за другой и одну циничнее другой, и все о том же, о том, что происходило там, без меня, как она изменяла мне. Я сгорал от негодования, злости и какого-то особенного чувства упоения своим унижением, созерцая эти картины, и не мог оторваться от них; не мог не смотреть на них, не мог стереть их, не мог не вызывать их. Мало того, чем более я созерцал эти воображаемые картины, тем более я верил в их действительность. Яркость, с которой представлялись мне эти картины, как будто служила доказательством тому, что то, что я воображал, было действительность. Какой-то дьявол, точно против моей воли, придумывал и подсказывал мне самые ужасные соображения. Давнишний разговор с братом Трухачевского вспомнился мне, и я с каким-то восторгом раздирал себе сердце этим разговором, относя его к Трухачевскому и моей жене.","- It was necessary to go thirty-five miles on horseback and eight hours on a cast-iron. The horse riding was great. It was a frosty autumn time with a bright sun. You know, this is the time when the studs are stamped on the oily road. The roads are smooth, the light is bright and the air is invigorating. It was good to ride in the tarantass. When it dawned and I went, I felt better. Looking at the horses, at the fields, at the oncoming ones, I forgot where I was going. Sometimes it seemed to me that I was just driving and that there was nothing that caused me, nothing of this. And it was especially joyful for me to be so forgotten. When I remembered where I was going, I said to myself: “Then it will be clear, don’t think about it.” In the middle of the road, moreover, an event occurred that delayed me on the road and amused me even more: the tarantass broke down, and it was necessary to repair it. This breakdown was of great importance in that it made me arrive in Moscow not at five o'clock, as I had expected, but at twelve o'clock and go home at one o'clock, since I did not get on the courier, but had to go on the passenger side. The cart ride, the mending, the payback, tea at the inn, conversations with the janitor - all this amused me even more. By dusk everything was ready, and I set off again, and it was even better to go at night than during the day. It was a young month, a little frost, still a beautiful road, horses, a cheerful driver, and I rode and enjoyed it, almost not thinking at all about what awaited me, or precisely because I especially enjoyed it because I knew what awaited me, and said goodbye to joys life. But this calm state of mine, the ability to suppress my feelings, ended with a ride on horseback. As soon as I entered the car, something completely different began. This eight-hour journey in the carriage was something terrible for me, which I will never forget for the rest of my life. Whether because, having got into the carriage, I vividly imagined myself already arrived, or because the railway has such an exciting effect on people, but only since I got into the carriage, I could no longer control my imagination, and it without ceasing with extraordinary brightness, she began to draw pictures for me that incited my jealousy, one after another and one more cynical than the other, and all about the same thing, about what happened there, without me, how she cheated on me. I was burning with indignation, anger and some special feeling of ecstasy at my humiliation, contemplating these pictures, and could not tear myself away from them; couldn't help but look at them, couldn't erase them, couldn't help calling them out. Moreover, the more I contemplated these imaginary pictures, the more I believed in their reality. The vividness with which these pictures appeared to me seemed to prove that what I imagined was reality. Some devil, as if against my will, invented and suggested to me the most terrible ideas. I remembered a long-standing conversation with Trukhachevsky's brother, and with some kind of delight I tore my heart with this conversation, referring it to Trukhachevsky and my wife.","‘I had to go thirty-five versts10 by horse and carriage, and then after that there was an eight-hour rail journey. The conditions were just right for a carriage ride. It was frosty autumn weather, with brilliant sunshine. You know, the time of the year when the calks in the horseshoes leave their imprints on a road surface that’s even, without a single rut in it. The roads were smooth, the light was bright and the air was invigorating. I really enjoyed that carriage ride. Once it had got light and I’d started my journey , I’d felt a load lift from my shoulders. As I looked at the horses, the fields, the passers-by, I forgot where it was I was going. At times I had the illusion that I was just out for a drive, and that none of what had given rise to this journey had ever taken place. And I experienced a strange joy in those moments of self-oblivion. Whenever I remembered where I was going, I would say to myself: “It’ll all be clear soon enough; don’t worry your head about it.” Moreover, halfway through the journey there occurred an event that delayed me and proved even more diverting: the carriage broke down and had to be repaired. This breakdown was very significant, as it meant that I got to Moscow not at five p.m., as I’d planned, but at midnight, and didn’t reach home until one in the morning – 1 missed the fast mail train, and had to take the ordinary passenger service. All the business of being towed by a cart, getting the repair done, paying the bill, having tea at the inn, chatting with the innkeeper – all that took my mind off things even further. By twilight everything was ready, and I set off once more; it was even better driving by night than it had been by day. There was a new moon, the frost was light, the road still perfect, the horses galloped, the coachman was in a good mood; I rode along, enjoying myself, because I was completely unmindful of what awaited me; or perhaps it was because I knew only too well what awaited me, and was saying farewell to the joys of life. But this tranquillity of spirit I experienced, this ability to suppress my emotions, all that came to an end when the carriage journey was over. As soon as I got into the railway coach I lost all control over my imagination: it began to paint for me, in the most lurid fashion, a rapid sequence of pictures which inflamed my jealousy, and each of which was more cynical than the last. They were all of the same thing – of what was happening there, in my absence, of her being unfaithful to me. I was consumed with rage, indignation and a kind of strange, drunken enjoyment of my own hurt pride as I contemplated these pictures, and I couldn’t tear myself away from them. I couldn’t help looking at them, I couldn’t erase them from my mind, and I couldn’t stop myself dreaming them up. But that wasn’t all: the more I contemplated these imaginary pictures, the more I believed they were real. The luridness with which they appeared before me seemed proof that what I was imagining was in fact reality. It was as though some devil was inventing the most abominable notions and suggesting them to me against my will. I suddenly remembered a conversation I’d once had long ago with Trukhachevsky’s brother, and I used it in order to lacerate my feelings with a kind of triumphant ecstasy, making it relate to Trukhachevsky and my wife.","“I had to travel twenty-five miles by horse and eight hours by rail. It was splendid traveling with horses. It was frosty autumnal weather with a brilliant sun—you know, that kind of weather when the tires leave their print on the slippery road. The roads were smooth, the light was dazzling, and the air was exhilarating. Yes, it was good traveling by horse and carriage. As soon as it grew light, and I was fairly on my way, my heart felt lighter. “As I looked at the horses, at the fields, at the persons I met, I forgot my errand. It sometimes seemed to me that I was simply out for a drive, and that there was nothing whatever to stir me so. And I felt particularly happy at thus forgetting myself. If by chance it occurred to me where I was bound, I said to myself: ‘Wait and see what will be. Don’t think about it now.’ “About halfway an event happened which delayed me and tended to distract my attention still more: the carriage broke down and it was necessary to mend it. This breakdown had great importance because it caused me to reach Moscow at midnight instead of at five o’clock (as I had expected) and home at one o’clock (for I missed the express and was obliged to take a local train). The mending of the carriage, the settlement of the bill, tea at an inn, the conversation with the innkeeper—all this served to divert me more and more. By twilight everything was ready and I was on my way once more; during the evening it was still more pleasant than traveling by day. There was a young moon, a slight touch of frost; the roads were still excellent, and so were the horses; the driver was jolly, and so I traveled on and enjoyed myself, scarcely thinking at all of what was awaiting me. Or perhaps I enjoyed myself especially because I knew what was awaiting me and I was having my last taste of the joys of life. “But this calm state of mind, the power of controlling my feelings, came to an end as soon as I stopped traveling with the horses. As soon as I entered the railroad carriage an entirely different state of things began. This eight-hour journey by rail was horrible to me, and I shall never forget it as long as I live. Either because as soon as I entered the carriage I vividly imagined myself as having already reached the end, or because railroad travel has an exciting effect on people—in any case, as soon as I took my seat I no longer had control over my imagination, which ceaselessly, with extraordinary vividness, began to bring up before me pictures kindling my jealousy. One after another they arose and always to the same effect: what had taken place during my absence and how she had deceived me! I was on fire with indignation, wrath, and fury, caused by my humiliation, as I contemplated these pictures. I could not tear myself away from them, could not help gazing at them, could not rub them out, could not help evoking them. And the more I contemplated these imaginary pictures the more I was convinced of their reality. The vividness with which these pictures presented themselves seemed to serve as a proof of the actuality of all that I imagined. A kind of a devil, completely against my will, suggested and stimulated the most horrible suggestions. A conversation I once had with Trukhashevsky ’s brother occurred to me, and with a sort of pleasure I lacerated my heart with this conversation, applying it to Trukhashevsky and my wife."
"— Напрасно так говорите, сударыня, — сказал старик, — животное скот, а человеку дан закон.","- In vain you say so, madam, - said the old man, - animal is cattle, but man has been given the law.","‘You’re wrong there, missus,’ said the old man.

But by this time the nervous man, whose eyes were now on fire, was clearly restraining himself only with difficulty.","the lawyer continued. But the nervous gentleman, his eyes agleam and restraining himself with difficulty, began, without allowing the lawyer to proceed, “No, I am speaking about the same thing, about the preference that one man or one woman has for one person above all others."
"Если бы явился не он, то другой бы явился. Если бы не предлог ревности, то другой.

If there’s any man alive to whom this doesn’t apply, he’s an extremely rare exception.

If there had not been one pretext for jealousy, there would have been another.

"Он издал свой звук, помолчал и отпил еще глоток чаю.","He made his sound, paused, and took another sip of tea.","He made his sound, fell silent, and took another mouthful of tea.","He emitted his peculiar sound, took another swallow of tea, and paused before resuming."
"И он несколько раз издал свои странные звуки и взялся за чай. Чай был страшно крепкий, не было воды, чтобы его разбавить. Я чувствовал, что меня волновали особенно выпитые мною два стакана. Должно быть, и на него действовал чай, потому что он становился все возбужденнее и возбужденнее. Голос его становился все более и более певучим и выразительным. Он беспрестанно менял позы, то снимал шапку, то надевал ее, и лицо его странно изменялось в той полутьме, в которой мы сидели.","And he made his strange noises several times and took up the tea. The tea was terribly strong, there was no water to dilute it. I felt that I was especially excited by the two glasses I drank.

He constantly changed positions, now taking off his hat, now putting it on, and his face changed strangely in the semi-darkness in which we were sitting.","He made his strange sound several times and began to sip his tea. The tea was horribly strong, and there was no water with which to dilute it. I felt it was the two glasses of the stuff I had already drunk that were making me so agitated.

He shifted position constantly, now removing his hat, now putting it on again, and his face kept altering strangely in the semi-darkness where we sat.","Several times he emitted his strange noises and sipped his tea.

He kept changing his position; one moment he would remove his hat, then he would put it on again; and his face kept changing strangely in the twilight in which we were sitting."
"— А ведь в этом-то и главная мерзость, — вскрикнул он. — Разврат ведь не в чем-нибудь физическом, ведь никакое безобразие физическое не разврат; а разврат, истинный разврат именно в освобождении себя от нравственных отношений к женщине, с которой входишь в физическое общение. А это-то освобождение я и ставил себе в заслугу. Помню, как я мучался раз, не успев заплатить женщине, которая, вероятно полюбив меня, отдалась мне. Я успокоился только тогда, когда послал ей деньги, показав этим, что я нравственно ничем не считаю себя связанным с нею. Вы не качайте головой, как будто вы согласны со мной, — вдруг крикнул он на меня. — Ведь я знаю эту штуку. Вы все, и вы, вы, в лучшем случае, если вы не редкое исключение, вы тех самых взглядов, каких я был. Ну, все равно, вы простите меня, — продолжал он, — но дело в том, что это ужасно, ужасно, ужасно!","""But that's the main abomination,"" he exclaimed. - Debauchery is not in anything physical, because no physical disgrace is depravity; and debauchery, true depravity, is precisely in freeing yourself from moral relations with a woman with whom you enter into physical communication. And it was this liberation that I took credit for. I remember how I suffered once, not having time to pay a woman who, probably having fallen in love with me, gave herself to me. I calmed down only when I sent her money, showing by this that I morally do not consider myself connected with her in any way. Don't shake your head as if you agree with me, he suddenly shouted at me. “Because I know this thing. All of you, and you, you, at best, if you are not a rare exception, you are of the same views as I was. Well, it doesn't matter, you'll forgive me,"" he continued, ""but the point is that it's terrible, terrible, terrible!","‘And that’s the really loathsome thing about it,’ he exclaimed. ‘Debauchery isn’t something physical. Not even the most outrageous physicality can be equated with debauchery. Debauchery – real debauchery – takes place when you free yourself from any moral regard for the woman you enter into physical relations with. But you see, I made the acquisition of that freedom into a matter of personal honour. I remember the agony of mind I once went through when I was in too much of a hurry to remember to pay a woman who had probably fallen in love with me and had let me go to bed with her. I just couldn’t rest easy until I’d sent her the money, thereby demonstrating that I didn’t consider myself morally obliged towards her in any way. Don’t sit there nodding your head as if you agreed with me!’ he suddenly shouted at me. ‘I know what you’re thinking! You’re all the same, you too, unless you’re a rare exception, you see things the way I did then. Oh I say, forget that, I’m sorry,’ he continued. ‘ But the fact is that it’s horrible, horrible, horrible!’","“And precisely here is the chief viciousness of it all!” he said vigorously. “Depravity does not lie in anything physical; it does not imply any physical abnormality. Depravity—genuine depravity—consists in freeing oneself from moral relations with women with whom you enter into physical relations. And this emancipation I considered a virtue. I remember how much it bothered me that one time I had not paid a woman who apparently loved me and had given herself to me, and I was only content again when I sent her the money—to show her that I did not consider myself morally bound to her. Don’t shake your head as if you agreed with me!” he suddenly cried. “I know that you too, unless you are a rare exception, have just such views as I had then. Well, no matter, please excuse me,” he went on. “But this is the whole trouble and it is awful!"
"Мне казалось, что он тяготится своим одиночеством, н я несколько раз хотел заговорить с ним, но всякий раз, когда глаза наши встречались, что случалось часто, так как мы сидели наискоски друг против друга, он отворачивался и брался за книгу или смотрел в окно.","It seemed to me that he was weary of his loneliness, and several times I wanted to talk to him, but every time our eyes met, which happened often, since we sat obliquely opposite each other, he turned away and took up a book or looked out the window .","I had the feeling that his solitude was weighing him down, and I tried several times to engage him in conversation.

"Вся жизнь с детьми и была для жены, а потому и для меня, не радость, а мука. Как же не мучаться? Она и мучалась постоянно. Бывало, только что успокоимся от какой-нибудь сцены ревности или просто ссоры и думаем пожить, почитать и подумать; только возьмешься за какое-нибудь дело, вдруг получается известие, что Васю рвет, или Маша сходила с кровью, или у Андрюши сыпь, ну и конечно, жизни уж нет. Куда скакать, за какими докторами, куда отделить? И начинаются клистиры, температуры, микстуры и доктора. Не успеет это кончиться, как начинается что-нибудь другое. Правильной, твердой семейной жизни не было. А было, как я вам говорил, постоянное спасение от воображаемых и действительных опасностей. Так ведь это теперь в большинстве семей. В моей же семье было особенно резко. Жена была чадолюбива и легковерна.","All life with children was for my wife, and therefore for me, not joy, but torment. How not to suffer? She was in constant pain. Sometimes we just calm down from some scene of jealousy or just a quarrel and think to live, read and think; As soon as you take on some business, suddenly you get the news that Vasya is vomiting, or Masha has come down with blood, or Andryusha has a rash, and, of course, there is no life anymore. Where to ride, for which doctors, where to separate? And the clysters, temperatures, potions and doctors begin. No sooner is this over than something else begins. There was no proper, solid family life. And there was, as I told you, a constant escape from imaginary and real dangers. So after all this is now in most families. In my own family, it was especially harsh. The wife was child-loving and gullible.","‘The whole of the existence my wife led with her children was for her, and consequently for me as well, not a joy but a torment. How could she not have suffered? She suffered continually. We might just have calmed down after some scene of jealousy or outright quarrel and be thinking that now we’d be able to get on with our lives for a while, do a bit of reading or thinking; yet no sooner had one settled down to some task or other than the news would arrive that Vasya was being sick, or there was blood in Masha’s stool, or Andryusha had a rash, and then it would all be over, life would once more cease to be possible. Where would one have to go galloping off to now, which doctors would have to be sought out, where would the child have to be taken? And then the enemas would start, the temperatures, the mixtures and the doctors’ visits. No sooner would this be at an end than something else would crop up. We had no stable, regular family life. All we had was, as I’ve told you, a constant running battle against dangers both real and imaginary. That’s the way it is for the majority of families nowadays, you know. In my own family it took a particularly nasty form. My wife was the maternal type, and she was easily gulled.","“So our whole life with our children was no joy but a torment for her, and therefore for me also. How could we help tormenting ourselves? And she did constantly torture herself. It used to be that just as we were calming down from a scene of jealousy or a simple quarrel and were planning to start to read something or do something, word would suddenly be brought that Vasya was vomiting, that Masha had diarrhea, or that Andrusha had a rash—and the end of it was that we had no kind of life. Where should we send? What doctor should we get? In which room should we isolate the patient? And then began enemas, temperatures, medicines, doctors. And this would scarcely be done before something else would begin. There was no regular family life. But as I have told you, there was a constant apprehension from real or fancied dangers. And that is the way it is in most families. In my family it was especially pronounced. My wife was dedicated to the children and believed every bit of advice and warning."

"— А как случится, тогда как? Ведь бывает же.","- And how will it happen, then how? After all, it happens.","‘But what if it does happen? It does, after all.’","“But if it does happen, what then? It has happened . . .”"
"Вот он-то с своей музыкой был причиной всего. Ведь на суде было представлено дело так, что все случилось из ревности. Ничуть не бывало, то есть не то, что ничуть не бывало, а то, да не то. На суде так и решено было, что я обманутый муж и что я убил, защищая свою поруганную честь (так ведь это называется по-ихнему). И от этого меня оправдали. Я на суде старался выяснить смысл дела, но они понимали так, что я хочу реабилитировать честь жены.","He, with his music, was the cause of everything. After all, the case was presented at the court in such a way that everything happened out of jealousy. Nothing happened, that is, not that nothing happened, but that, but not that. At the trial, it was decided that I was a deceived husband and that I killed in defense of my desecrated honor (that's what they call it in their language). And from this I was acquitted. At the trial, I tried to find out the meaning of the case, but they understood that I wanted to rehabilitate the honor of my wife.","‘He and his music were the real cause of it all. At my trial the whole thing was made to look as though it had been caused by jealousy. Nothing could have been further from the truth. I’m not saying jealousy didn’t play any part at all, mind – it did, but it wasn’t the most important thing. At my trial they decided I was a wronged husband who’d killed his wife in order to defend his outraged honour (that’s the way they put it in their language). So I was acquitted. During the court hearings I tried to explain what was really at the bottom of it all, but they just thought I was trying to rehabilitate my wife’s honour.","“Well, then, this man with his music was the cause of all the trouble. You see, at the trial the whole affair was represented as having been caused by my jealousy. This was not so at all. That is, it was not exactly so. It was, and it was not. At the trial it was decided that I had been deceived and that I had committed the murder in defending my outraged honor—so they called it in their language—and on this ground I was acquitted. At the trial I did my best to explain my idea of it, but they assumed that I had wished to restore my wife’s honor."
"А то страшное средство в руках кого попало. Например, хоть бы эту Крейцерову сонату, первое престо. Разве можно играть в гостиной среди декольтированных дам это престо? Сыграть и потом похлопать, а потом есть мороженое и говорить о последней сплетне. Эти вещи можно играть только при известных, важных, значительных обстоятельствах, и тогда, когда требуется совершить известные, соответствующие этой музыке важные поступки. Сыграть и сделать то, на что настроила эта музыка. А то несоответственное ни месту, ни времени вызывание энергии, чувства, ничем не проявляющегося, не может не действовать губительно. На меня, по крайней мере, вещь эта подействовала ужасно; мне как будто открылись совсем новые, казалось мне, чувства, новые возможности, о которых я не знал до сих пор. Да вот как, совсем не так, как я прежде думал и жил, а вот как, как будто говорилось мне в душе. Что такое было то новое, что я узнал, я не мог себе дать отчета, но сознание этого нового состояния было очень радостно. Все те же лица, и в том числе и жена и он, представлялись совсем в другом свете. После этого престо они доиграли прекрасное, но обыкновенное, не новое andante с пошлыми варьяциями и совсем слабый финал. Потом еще играли по просьбе гостей то «Элегию» Эрнста, то еще разные вещицы. Все это было хорошо, но все это не произвело на меня и 0,01 того впечатления, которое произвело первое. Все это происходило уже на фоне того впечатления, которое произвело первое. Мне было легко, весело весь вечер. Жену же я никогда не видал такою, какою она была в этот вечер. Эти блестящие глаза, эта строгость, значительность выражения, пока она играла, и эта совершенная растаянность какая-то, слабая, жалкая и блаженная улыбка после того, как они кончили. Я все это видел, но не приписывал этому никакого другого значения, кроме того, что она испытывала то же, что и я, что и ей, как и мне, открылись, как будто вспомнились новые, неиспытанные чувства. Вечер кончился благополучно, и все разъехались.","And that terrible tool in the hands of just anyone. For example, if only this Kreutzer Sonata, the first presto. Is it possible to play this presto in the living room among low-cut ladies? Play and then clap, and then eat ice cream and talk about the latest gossip. These things can be played only under certain, important, significant circumstances, and when it is necessary to perform certain important actions corresponding to this music. Play and do what this music has set you up for. And that inappropriate neither place nor time, the evocation of energy, feelings, which is not manifested by anything, cannot but act destructively. For me, at least, this thing had a terrible effect; it seemed to me that completely new, it seemed to me, feelings, new possibilities, about which I had not known until now, opened up. Yes, this is how, not at all the way I thought and lived before, but this is how, as if it was spoken to me in my soul. What this new thing was that I learned, I could not give myself an account, but the consciousness of this new state was very joyful. All the same faces, including his wife and he, appeared in a completely different light. After this presto they played a beautiful but ordinary, not new andante with vulgar variations and a very weak finale. Then, at the request of the guests, they played either Ernst's ""Elegy"" or other little things. All this was good, but all this did not make even 0.01 of the impression on me that the first one did. All this happened already against the background of the impression that the first one made. It was easy for me, fun all evening. I never saw my wife the way she was that evening. Those sparkling eyes, that sternness, the significance of expression while she was playing, and that utter distraction, some kind of weak, pitiful and blissful smile after they had finished. I saw all this, but did not attribute any other meaning to it, except that she experienced the same thing as I did, that it opened up to her, like me, as if new, untested feelings were remembered. The evening ended happily and everyone left.","‘Yet this fearful medium is available to anyone who cares to make use of it. Take that “Kreutzer Sonata”, for example, take its first movement, the presto: can one really allow it to be played in a drawing-room full of women in low-cut dresses? To be played, and then followed by a little light applause, and the eating of ice-cream, and talk about the latest society gossip? Such pieces should only be played on certain special, solemn, significant occasions when certain solemn actions have to be performed, actions that correspond to the nature of the music. It should be played, and as it’s played those actions which it’s inspired with its significance should be performed. Otherwise the generation of all that feeling and energy, which are quite inappropriate to either the place or the occasion, and which aren’t allowed any outlet, can’t have anything but a harmful effect. On me, at any rate, that piece had the most shattering effect; I had the illusion that I was discovering entirely new emotions, new possibilities I’d known nothing of before then. “Yes, that’s it, it’s got absolutely nothing to do with the way I’ve been used to living and seeing the world, that’s how it ought to be,” I seemed to hear a voice saying inside me. What this new reality I’d discovered was, I really didn’t know, but my awareness of this new state of consciousness filled me with joy. Everyone in the room, including Trukhachevsky and my wife, appeared to me in an entirely new light. ‘After the presto they played the attractive but unoriginal andante with its rather trite variations, and then the finale, which is really weak. Then, at the request of members of the audience, they played things like Ernst’s “Elégie”, and various other brief encores. These were all quite pleasant, but none of them made one tenth of the impression on me that the presto had done. They all came filtering through the impression the presto had made on me. I felt cheerful and buoyant all evening. As for my wife, I’d never seen her looking as she did that evening. Her radiant eyes, her serenity, the gravity of her expression as she played, and that utterly melting quality, the weak, pathetic, yet blissful smile on her lips after they’d finished – I saw all this, but I didn’t attach any particular significance to it, beyond supposing that she had experienced the same feelings as I had, and that she, like myself, had discovered, or perhaps rather remembered, emotions that were new and unfamiliar. The evening ended satisfactorily, and everyone went home.","“Indeed it is a terrible power to place in anyone’s hands. For example, how could anyone play this Kreutzer Sonata, the first Presto, in a drawing room before ladies dressed in low-cut gowns? To play that Presto, then to applaud it, and then to eat ices and talk over the last bit of scandal? These things should be played only under certain grave, significant conditions, and only then when certain deeds corresponding to such music are to be accomplished: first play the music and perform that which this music was composed for. But to call forth an energy which is not consonant with the place or the time, and an impulse which does not manifest itself in anything, cannot fail to have a harmful effect. On me, at least, it had a horrible impact. It seemed to me that entirely new impulses, new possibilities, were revealed to me in myself, such as I had never dreamed of before. “ ‘This is the way I should live and think—not at all as I have lived and thought hitherto,’ seemed to be whispered into my soul. What this new thing was I now knew I could not explain even to myself, but the consciousness of this new state of mind was very delightful. All those faces— his and my wife’s among them—presented themselves in a new light. “After the Allegro they played the beautiful but rather trite and unoriginal Andante—with its uninspired variations—and the weak Finale. Then at the request of the guests they played other things, first an elegy by Ernst and then various other trifles. All this was very good, but it did not produce on me a hundredth part of the impression which the first did. But all the music had as a background the impression which the first produced. “I felt gay and happy. I never saw my wife look as she did that evening: her glistening eyes, her dignity and serenity of expression while she was playing, her perfectly melting mood, her tenderly pathetic and blissful smile after they had finished playing. I saw it all, but attributed it to the notion that she was experiencing the same thing I was, that before her, as before me, new and hitherto unexampled feelings were revealed, dimly rising in her consciousness. The evening was a great success and the guests departed."
"— Ну, вот так я и жил до тридцати лет, ни на минуту не оставляя намерения жениться и устроить себе самую возвышенную, чистую семейную жизнь, и с этой целью приглядывался к подходящей для этой цели девушке, — продолжал он. — Я гваздался в гное разврата и вместе с тем разглядывал девушек, по своей чистоте достойных меня. Многих я забраковывал именно потому, что они были недостаточно чисты для меня; наконец я нашел такую, которую счел достойной себя. Это была одна из двух дочерей когда-то очень богатого, но разорившегося пензенского помещика.","“Well, that’s how I lived until I was thirty, not abandoning for a moment the intention of marrying and arranging for myself the most exalted, pure family life, and for this purpose I kept an eye on a girl suitable for this purpose,” he continued. “I drank in the pus of debauchery and at the same time looked at the girls who, in their purity, were worthy of me. Many I rejected precisely because they were not pure enough for me; finally I found one that I considered worthy of myself. She was one of two daughters of a once very rich but bankrupt Penza landowner.","‘Well, and so that’s the way I lived until I was thirty, without ever for one moment abandoning my intention of getting married and building for myself the most elevated and purest of family lives, and with that end in view I was keeping an eye out for a girl who might fill the bill,’ he continued. ‘I was wallowing in the slime of debauchery, and at the same time looking for girls who might be pure enough to be worthy of me! I rejected a lot of them because of that – because they weren’t pure enough; but at last I found one whom I considered worthy of me. She was one of the two daughters of a Penza landowner who had once been very rich but had lost all his money.","“Well, that was the way I lived until I was thirty years of age, never for a moment abandoning my intention of getting married and enjoying the most lofty and unsullied existence. And with this end in mind I looked at every girl,” he continued. “I was soiled with lewdness and yet, at the same time, I was looking for a girl whose purity would meet my standards. I rejected many of them instantly on the ground that they were not sufficiently pure for me, but at last I found one whom I thought worthy of me. She was one of the two daughters of a man in Penza, who had formerly been very rich but was now quite poor."
"О том же, что было главным для меня, о своей вине, измене, она как бы считала нестоящим упоминать.","About the same thing that was the main thing for me, about her guilt, betrayal, she seemed to consider it worthless to mention.","‘The thing I thought most important – the question of her guilt, her unfaithfulness – she didn’t even seem to think worth mentioning.","“As to the principal thing for me—her guilt, her unfaithfulness— she did not consider it worth while to say a word!"
"И он стал рассказывать далее что-то, чего я не мог расслышать. Вслед за мной прошли еще пассажиры, прошел кондуктор, вбежал артельщик, и довольно долго был шум, из-за которого не слышно было разговора. Когда все затихло и я опять услыхал голос адвоката, разговор, очевидно, с частного случая перешел уже на общие соображения.","And he began to tell further something that I could not hear. More passengers followed me, a conductor walked by, an artel worker ran in, and for quite some time there was a noise, because of which a conversation was not heard. When all was quiet and I again heard the lawyer's voice, the conversation evidently moved from a particular case to general considerations.","And he began to say something else, something I could not make out. More passengers came trooping in behind me; then the guard walked down the carriage, followed by a porter in a tremendous hurry, and for quite a long time there ensued such an uproar that no conversation could possibly be heard. When things had quietened down again and I could once more hear the lawyer’s voice, the conversation had evidently passed from the particular to the general.","And he proceeded to tell something more which I could not hear. Behind me came other passengers, then came the conductor, followed by a porter bustling through, and there was so much noise for a time that I could not hear what they were talking about. When it grew quieter the lawyer’s voice was heard again, but the conversation had evidently gone over from a particular instance to general considerations."
"— Ну, а тут так подошло: и мое состояние, и платье хорошо, и катанье на лодках удалось. Двадцать раз не удавалось, а тут удалось. Вроде как капкан. Я не смеюсь. Ведь теперь браки так и устраиваются, как капканы. Ведь естественно что? Девка созрела, надо ее выдать. Кажется, как просто, когда девка не урод и есть мужчины, желающие жениться. Так и делалось в старину. Вошла в возраст дева, родители устраивали брак. Так делалось, делается во всем человечестве: у китайцев, индейцев, магометан, у нас в народе; так делается в роде человеческом по крайней мере в 0,99 его части. Только в 0,01 или меньше нас, распутников, нашли, что это нехорошо, и выдумали новое. Да что же новое-то? А новое то, что девы сидят, а мужчины, как на базар, ходят и выбирают. А девки ждут и думают, но не смеют сказать: «Батюшка, меня! нет, меня. Не ее, а меня: у меня, смотри, какие плечи и другое». А мы, мужчины, похаживаем, поглядываем и очень довольны. «Знаю, мол, я не попадусь». Похаживают, посматривают, очень довольны, что это для них все устроено. Глядь, не поберегся, — хлоп, тут и есть!","— Well, and here it came up so well: both my condition and the dress are good, and boating was successful. Twenty times it was not possible, and here it was possible. Kind of like a trap. I'm not laughing. After all, now marriages are arranged like traps. After all, what is natural? The girl has matured, we must give her away. It seems so easy when a girl is not ugly and there are men who want to get married. This is how it was done in the old days. She entered the age of a virgin, her parents arranged a marriage. This is how it was done, is being done in all mankind: among the Chinese, Indians, Mohammedans, among our people; this is done in the human race in at least 0.99 of its part. Only 0.01 or less of us libertines found that it was not good and invented a new one. So what's new? And the new thing is that the virgins are sitting, and the men, as if at a market, go and choose. And the girls wait and think, but do not dare to say: “Father, me! I am not here. Not her, but me: I have, look what shoulders and more. And we, men, walk around, look and are very pleased. “I know, they say, I won’t get caught.” They walk around, look, they are very pleased that this is all arranged for them. Look, don't be careful - clap, there it is!","‘Well, this time it all clicked together: my state of mind, her dress and the boat trip. And it worked. Twenty times before it hadn’t worked, but now it did – the way a trap does. I’m quite serious. Marriages nowadays are set like traps. Only stands to reason, doesn’t it? The girl’s grown up now, she’ll have to be married to someone. It all seems so simple, as long as the girl’s not a freak and there are men around who want to get married. That’s the way it was done in the old days. When a girl came of age, her parents arranged a marriage for her. That’s how it was done, and that’s how it’s done all over the world to this very day: among the Chinese, the Hindus, the Muslims, among our own common people. That’s how it’s done among at least ninety-nine per cent of the human race. It’s only we one per cent or less of debauchees who’ve decided that’s not good enough and have thought up something new. And what is that something new? It’s girls sitting in line while men come and go in front of them as if they were at a market, making their choice. As they sit there waiting, the girls think, not daring to say it out loud : “Choose me, dearest! No, me. Not her, me: look what nice shoulders and all the rest of it I have.” We men walk up and down, take a look, and are very pleased with what we see. “I know what they’re up to,” we say to ourselves, “but I won’t fall into their trap. ” We walk up and down, we take a look, we’re thoroughly gratified that all this has been arranged for our benefit. We look, are taken off our guard for a moment – and slam! There’s another one caught!’","“Well, so my rank, my fortune, my good clothes, the excursions in boats did the job. Twenty times it did not succeed, but this time it succeeded like a trap. I am not jesting. You see, nowadays marriages are always arranged—like traps. Do you see how natural it is? The girl has arrived at maturity and must be married. What could be simpler when the girl is not a monster and there are men who wish to get married? That is the way it used to be done. The girl reaches the right age; her parents arrange a marriage. So it has been done, throughout the world, among the Chinese, the Hindus, the Mohammedans, among the common Russian people—among at least ninety-nine per cent of the human race. It is only among a small one per cent, among us libertines and debauchees, that this custom has been found to be bad, and so we have invented another. Now, what is this new way? It is this: the girls sit round and the men come, as at a bazaar, to take their choice. And the girls wait and wonder and have their own ideas, but they dare not say, ‘Dear sir, take me!’ or, ‘No, me!’ or, ‘Not her, but me!’ or, ‘Look at my shoulders and all the rest!’ “And we, the men, walk around and look them over and are quite smug. ‘I know a thing or two, I won’t be caught.’ They go around, they look, they are satisfied that this is all arranged for their special pleasure. ‘Look, but don’t get taken in!’ ”"

"Ведь мы, мужчины, только не знаем, и не знаем потому, что не хотим знать, женщины же знают очень хорошо, что самая возвышенная, поэтическая, как мы ее называем, любовь зависит не от нравственных достоинств, а от физической близости и притом прически, цвета, покроя платья. Скажите опытной кокетке, задавшей себе задачу пленить человека, чем она скорее хочет рисковать: тем, чтобы быть в присутствии того, кого она прельщает, изобличенной во лжи, жестокости, даже распутстве, или тем, чтобы показаться при нем в дурно сшитом и некрасивом платье, — всякая всегда предпочтет первое. Она знает, что наш брат все врет о высоких чувствах — ему нужно только тело, и потому он простит все гадости, а уродливого, безвкусного, дурного тона костюма не простит. Кокетка знает это сознательно, но всякая невинная девушка знает это бессознательно, как знают это животные.","After all, we men just don’t know, and we don’t know because we don’t want to know, women know very well that the most sublime, poetic, as we call it, love does not depend on moral virtues, but on physical proximity and, moreover, hairstyle , colors, cut dresses. Tell an experienced coquette, who has set herself the task of captivating a person, what she rather wants to risk: by being in the presence of the one whom she seduces, convicted of lies, cruelty, even debauchery, or by appearing in front of him in a badly tailored and ugly dress , - everyone will always prefer the first. She knows that our brother is always lying about high feelings - he only needs the body, and therefore he will forgive all the nasty things, but he will not forgive the ugly, tasteless, bad tone of the suit. The coquette knows it consciously, but every innocent girl knows it unconsciously, as animals know it.","‘It’s only we men who don’t know, and we don’t know because we don’t want to know. Women know perfectly well that the most elevated love – the most “poetic”, as we call it – depends not on moral qualities but on physical proximity and also on things like hair-style, or the colour and the cut of a dress. Ask any experienced coquette who has set herself the task of ensnaring the attentions of a man which she would rather risk: to be accused of lying, cruelty and even of whorish behaviour in the presence of the man she is trying to attract, or to appear before his gaze in an ugly, badly made dress – and she will always choose the former. She knows that our man’s lying when he goes on about lofty emotions – all he wants is her body, and so he will willingly forgive her the most outrageous behaviour. What he won’t forgive, however, is an outfit that is ugly, tasteless or lacking in style. A coquette’s knowledge of this is a conscious one; but every innocent young girl knows it unconsciously, as animals do.","And we men don’t know—we don’t know because we don’t want to know—but women know perfectly well that the loftiest and most poetic love depends not on moral qualities but on physical closeness and on the way of doing up one’s hair, one’s complexion, the cut of a gown. Ask an experienced coquette which she would prefer to risk: being detected in falsehood, cruelty, even immorality, in the presence of the one she is trying to entice, or to appear before him in a badly made or unbecoming gown—and she will always choose the first. She knows that man lies when he talks about lofty feelings—all he wants is the body—and so he pardons anything but an ugly, unbecoming, unfashionable costume. The coquette knows this consciously; every innocent girl knows this unconsciously, just as animals know it."
"— Они говорят, — вступился адвокат, указывая на даму, — что брак должен вытекать, во-первых, из привязанности, любви, если хотите, и что если налицо есть таковая, то только в этом случае брак представляет из себя нечто, так сказать, священное. Затем, что всякий брак, в основе которого не заложены естественные привязанности — любовь, если хотите, — не имеет в себе ничего нравственно обязательного. Так ли я понимаю? — обратился он к даме.","“They say,” the lawyer intervened, pointing to the lady, “that marriage should flow, firstly, from affection, love, if you like, and that if there is such, then only in this case marriage is something, so to speak , sacred. Then, that any marriage, which is not based on natural attachments - love, if you like - does not have anything morally binding in itself. Is that how I understand? he turned to the lady.","‘What she means,’ said the lawyer, intervening and designating the lady, ‘is firstly that marriage ought to be based primarily on affection – love, if you like – and that only if this is present does marriage offer something that is, as it were, sacred. Secondly, that no marriage which is not based on natural affection – love, if you like – carries with it any moral obligation. Have I understood you correctly?’ he asked, turning to the lady.","“She says,” interrupted the lawyer, indicating the lady, “that marriage ought to result in the first place from an attachment—from love, if you will—and that when such a love actually exists, only marriage furnishes, so to speak, some consecration. Therefore, any marriage in which there is no genuine attachment as a foundation—love, if you wish to call it that—has no moral obligation. Do I express your idea correctly?” he asked, addressing the lady."

"— Старого завета папаша, — сказал приказчик.","“Father of the Old Testament,” said the clerk.","‘That fellow was straight out of the Old Testament,’ said the salesclerk.",“An Old Testament patriarch!” exclaimed the clerk.

"— Да нет, помилуйте… — сам не зная, что «помилуйте», сказал адвокат.","- No, pardon ... - not knowing what ""pardon"", said the lawyer.","‘Not at all, for heaven’s sake…’ said the lawyer, not quite sure himself what he meant by this ‘for heaven’s sake’.","“Not at all,” said the lawyer, himself not knowing exactly what he meant."
"— Убирайся, или я тебя убью! — закричал я, подойдя к ней и схватив ее за руку. Я сознательно усиливал интонации злости своего голоса, говоря это. И должно быть, я был страшен, потому что она так заробела, что даже не имела силы уйти, а только говорила:","""Get out or I'll kill you!"" I shouted, going up to her and grabbing her by the arm. I deliberately increased the anger in my voice as I said this. And I must have been terrified, because she became so timid that she didn’t even have the strength to leave, but only said:","‘“Go, or I’ll kill you!” I shouted suddenly, going up to her and seizing her by the arm, consciously exaggerating the level of animosity in my voice. I must really have appeared terrifying, as she suddenly lost her nerve to the point where she didn’t even have the strength to leave the room, but merely said: “Vasya, what is it,","“ ‘Get out of here or I’ll kill you!’ I screamed, moving toward her and seizing her by the arm. I was aware of raising my voice to a higher pitch, and I must have become terrifying because she became so frightened that she had not the power to go."
"Но Позднышев, не слушая его, быстро повернулся и ушел на свое место. Господин с дамой шептались. Я сидел рядом с Позднышевым и молчал, не умея придумать, что сказать. Читать было темно, и потому я закрыл глаза и притворился, что хочу заснуть. Так мы проехали молча до следующей станции.","But Pozdnyshev, not listening to him, quickly turned around and went to his place. The gentleman and the lady whispered. I sat next to Pozdnyshev and was silent, unable to think of what to say. It was dark to read, so I closed my eyes and pretended to want to sleep. So we drove in silence to the next station.","But Pozdnyshev, who was not paying any attention to him, turned round sharply and went back to his seat. The lawyer and the lady whispered to one another. I was sitting beside Pozdnyshev and I kept quiet, not knowing what to say.

We continued in this silent fashion until the train reached the next station.","But Pozdnyshev, not heeding him, turned quickly and went back to his seat. The lawyer talked in whispers with the lady.

We rode in silence this way till we reached the next station."
"— Вы, как я вижу, узнали, кто я? — тихо и как будто спокойно сказал седой господин.",“I see you know who I am?” the gray-haired gentleman said quietly and as if calmly.,"‘I can see you’ve recognized me,’ said the grey-haired man quietly, trying to appear unruffled.","“I imagine you have guessed who I am,” the gray-haired gentleman said, softly and with a certain appearance of calm."
"— Да ведь это только в романах, а в жизни никогда. В жизни бывает это предпочтение одного перед другими на года, что очень редко, чаще на месяцы, а то на недели, на дни, на часы, — говорил он, очевидно зная, что он удивляет всех своим мнением, и довольный этим.","“But that’s only in novels, never in real life. In life there is this preference for one over the other for years, which is very rare, more often for months, or even for weeks, for days, for hours, ”he said, obviously knowing that he surprised everyone with his opinion, and pleased with this.","‘But that only happens in novels, not in real life. In real life a preference like that lasts maybe a year, but that’s very rare; more often it’s a few months, or weeks, or days, or hours,’ he said, evidently aware that this opinion would shock everyone, and pleased at the result.","“Yes, but that is true only in novels, never in real life. In real life this preference for one person may occasionally last a year, but more often it is measured by months, or even by weeks or days or hours,” he said, evidently realizing with some satisfaction that he was surprising everyone by his opinion."
"На четвертый год с обеих сторон решено было как-то само собой, что понять друг друга, согласиться друг с другом мы не можем. Мы перестали уже пытаться договориться до конца. О самых простых вещах, в особенности о детях, мы оставались неизменно каждый при своем мнении. Как я теперь вспоминаю, мнения, которые я отстаивал, были вовсе мне не так дороги, чтобы я не мог поступиться ими; но она была противного мнения, и уступить — значило уступить ей. А этого я не мог. Она тоже. Она, вероятно, считала себя всегда совершенно правой передо мной, а уж я в своих глазах был всегда свят перед нею. Вдвоем мы были почти обречены на молчание или на такие разговоры, которые, я уверен, животные могут вести между собой: «Который час? Пора спать. Какой нынче обед? Куда ехать? Что написано в газете? Послать за доктором. Горло болит у Маши». Стоило на волосок выступить из этого до невозможного сузившегося кружка разговоров, чтобы вспыхнуло раздражение. Выходили стычки и выражения ненависти за кофе, скатерть, пролетку, за ход в винте, — все дела, которые ни для того, ни для другого не могли иметь никакой важности. Во мне, по крайней мере, ненависть к ней часто кипела страшная! Я смотрел иногда, как она наливала чай, махала ногой или подносила ложку ко рту, шлюпала, втягивала в себя жидкость, и ненавидел ее именно за это, как за самый дурной поступок. Я не замечал тогда, что периоды злобы возникали во мне совершенно правильно и равномерно, соответственно периодам того, что мы называли любовью. Период любви — период злобы; энергический период любви — длинный период злобы, более слабое проявление любви — короткий период злобы. Тогда мы не понимали, что эта любовь и злоба были то же самое животное чувство, только с разных концов. Жить так было бы ужасно, если бы мы понимали свое положение; но мы не понимали и не видали его. В этом и спасенье и казнь человека, что, когда он живет неправильно, он может себя затуманивать, чтобы не видать бедственности своего положения. Так делали и мы. Она старалась забыться напряженными, всегда поспешными занятиями хозяйством, обстановкой, нарядами своими и детей, учением, здоровьем детей. У меня же было свое пьянство — пьянство службы, охоты, карт. Мы оба постоянно были заняты. Мы оба чувствовали, что чем больше мы заняты, тем злее мы можем быть друг к другу. «Тебе хорошо гримасничать, — думал я на нее, — а ты вот меня промучала сценами всю ночь, а мне заседанье». — «Тебе хорошо, — не только думала, но и говорила она, — а я всю ночь не спала с ребенком».","In the fourth year on both sides, it was somehow decided by itself that we could not understand each other, agree with each other. We have already stopped trying to reach an agreement to the end. About the simplest things, especially about children, we remained invariably each with our own opinion. As I remember now, the opinions I defended were not at all so dear to me that I could not give up on them; but she was of the opposite opinion, and to yield was to yield to her. And I couldn't do that. She too. She probably considered herself always completely right in front of me, and in my own eyes I was always holy before her. The two of us were almost doomed to silence, or to such conversations as I am sure animals can have among themselves: “What time is it? It's time to sleep. What is lunch today? Where to go? What is in the newspaper? Send for a doctor. Masha's throat hurts."" It was worth stepping out of this impossibly narrowed circle of conversations by a hair's breadth for irritation to flare up. There were skirmishes and expressions of hatred over coffee, a tablecloth, a cab, for a move in a screw - all matters that could not be of any importance to either one or the other. In me, at least, terrible hatred for her often boiled! I watched sometimes how she poured tea, waved her foot or brought a spoon to her mouth, sloshed, sucked in the liquid, and hated her precisely for this, as for the most evil deed. I did not notice then that the periods of anger arose in me quite regularly and evenly, corresponding to the periods of what we called love. The period of love is the period of malice; an energetic period of love is a long period of anger, a weaker manifestation of love is a short period of anger. Then we did not understand that this love and anger were the same animal feeling, only from different ends. It would be terrible to live like this if we understood our position; but we did not understand and did not see him. This is the salvation and execution of a person, that when he lives incorrectly, he can cloud himself so as not to see the misery of his situation. So did we. She tried to forget herself with intense, always hasty housekeeping, furnishings, her and her children's outfits, teaching, and the health of children. I had my own drunkenness - the drunkenness of the service, hunting, cards. Both of us were constantly busy. We both felt that the busier we were, the angrier we could be towards each other. “It’s good for you to grimace,” I thought at her, “but you tortured me with scenes all night, and I have a meeting.” “It’s good for you,” she not only thought, but also said, “but I didn’t sleep with the child all night.”","‘By the fourth year of our marriage we both seemed to have accepted, almost as if it had been decided for us, that we were never going to be able to understand each other or agree about anything. We’d already given up trying to settle our arguments. We each obstinately stuck to our own point of view about even the most simple things, but particularly about the children. Thinking back on it now, I can see that the opinions I used to defend were by no means so dear to me that I couldn’t have got along without them; no, the point was that the opinions she held were the opposite of mine, and yielding to them meant yielding to… her. This I was not prepared to do. Neither was she. I think it’s probable she always considered herself entirely in the right where I was concerned, and as for me, I saw myself as a saint in comparison with her. When we were left alone together we either had to remain silent or else carry on the sort of conversations I’m convinced animals have with one another: “What’s the time? Bedtime. What’s for dinner today? Where are we going to go? Is there anything in the newspaper? Send for the doctor. Masha’s got a sore throat. ” We had only to stray out of this impossibly narrow focus of conversation by as much as a hair’s breadth, and our mutual irritation would flare up again. Quarrels would erupt over things like the coffee, a table-cloth, a cab, or a lead at whist – none of them things that were of the slightest importance to either of us. I used to boil inwardly with the most dreadful hatred for her! Sometimes I’d watch the way she poured her tea, the way she swung her leg or brought her spoon to her mouth; I’d listen to the little slurping noises she made as she sucked the liquid in, and I used to hate her for that as for the most heinous act. I didn’t notice it then, but I was regularly affected by bouts of animosity that used to correspond to the bouts of what we called “love”. A bout of “love” would be followed by one of animosity; a vigorous bout of “love” would be followed by a long bout of animosity, while a less intense bout of “love” would be followed by a correspondingly shorter bout of animosity. We didn’t realize it then, but this “love” and animosity were just two sides of the same coin, the same animal feeling. To live like that would have been insufferable if we’d understood the situation we were in, but we didn’t understand it – we weren’t even aware of it. It’s the salvation as well as the punishment of human beings that when they’re living irregular lives, they’re able to wrap themselves in a blanket of fog so that they can’t see the wretchedness of their situation. That’s what we did. She tried to forget herself in a frantic round of concerns, always hastily attended to: the furniture, her clothes and those of her children, the children’s health and their education. As for myself, I had my own anaesthetic, the anaesthetic of work, hunting and cards. We were both constantly busy. We both sensed that the busier we were, the more opportunity we would have for being nasty to one another. “It’s all very well for you to make faces,” I used to think, “but you’ve plagued me all night with your scenes and I’ve got a meeting today.” “It’s all very well for you,” she used not only to think, but say out loud, “ but I haven’t been able to get a wink of sleep all night because of the baby.”","“In the fourth year it was admitted by both of us, though tacitly, that we could not understand each other—that we could not agree. We stopped trying to talk anything over to the end. In regard to the simplest things, especially the children, we each kept our own opinion unchangeably. As I now remember, the opinions I held were not so precious that I could not have given them up; but she had opposing notions, and to yield to them meant to yield to her. And this I could not do. Nor could she yield to me. She evidently considered herself always perfectly right toward me, and, as for me compared to her, I was always a saint in my own eyes. When we were together we were practically reduced to silence or to such conversations as animals probably carry on together: ‘What time is it?’ ‘Is it bedtime?’ ‘What will you have for dinner today?’ ‘Where will you drive?’ ‘What is the news?’ ‘We must send for the doctor; Masha has a sore throat.’ “It required only a step of a hair’s width beyond this unendurably narrowing circle of conventional sentences to inspire a quarrel— skirmishes and expressions of hatred about the coffee, the tablecloth, the drive, a play at whist—in fact, over trifles which could not have had the slightest importance for either of us. In me, at least, hatred of her boiled terribly. I often looked at her when she was drinking tea, dangling her crossed leg, bringing her spoon to her mouth to sip from it, swallowing—I hated her for this very trifle as if it were the worst of crimes. I did not notice that these periods broke out in me with regularity and uniformity, corresponding to the periods of what we called love. A period of love—then a period of hatred. An energetic period of passion—then a long period of hatred. A feebler show of passion— then a briefer outbreak of hatred. “We did not then comprehend that this love and hatred were one and the same animal passion, only with opposite poles. It would have been horrible to live in this way if we had realized our situation; but we did not realize it and did not see it. In this lies the salvation, as well as the punishment, of a man—that, when he is living irregularly, he may blind himself so as not to see the wretchedness of his situation. “Thus it was with us. She sought to forget herself in strenuous and absorbing occupations —her housekeeping, the arrangement of the furniture, dressing herself and the family, and the education and health of the children. I had my own affairs to attend to—drinking, hunting, playing cards, going to my office. We were both busy all the time. We both felt that the busier we were, the more justified we were in being annoyed with each other. ‘It is very well for you to make up such grimaces,’ I would think, mentally addressing her. ‘ You tormented me all night with your scenes, but now I have a meeting to attend.’ ‘It is all very well for you,’ she would not only think, but even say aloud, ‘but the baby kept me awake all night long.’ “These new theories of hypnotism, mental disease, and hysteria are all an absurdity—not a simple absurdity, a vile and pernicious one."
"Во время остановки, перед вечером второго дня, на большой станции нервный господин этот сходил за горячей водой и заварил себе чай. Господин же с аккуратными новыми вещами, адвокат, как я узнал впоследствии, с своей соседкой, курящей дамой в полумужском пальто, пошли пить чай на станцию.","During a stop, before the evening of the second day, at a large station, this nervous gentleman went for hot water and made himself tea. The gentleman with neat new things, the lawyer, as I later found out, with his neighbor, a smoking lady in a half-man's coat, went to the station to drink tea.","Shortly before evening on that second day, the train stopped at a large station, and the nervous man stepped outside, fetched some boiling water and made tea for himself. The man with the smart luggage, a lawyer, as I later discovered, went to have a glass of tea in the station buffet with his travelling companion, the cigarette-smoking lady in the man’s coat.","Just before the evening of our second day, during a stop at a large station, this nervous gentleman left the carriage to get some hot water with which to make himself some tea.

"— Потому он дурак, — сказал старик. — Кабы он спервоначала не дал ей ходу, а укороту бы дал настоящую, жила бы небось. Волю не давать надо сначала. Не верь лошади в поле, а жене в доме.","“Because he is a fool,” said the old man. “If he hadn’t given it a go at first, but shortened it with a real one, I’d probably have lived. The will must not be given at first. Do not trust the horse in the field, but the wife in the house.","‘So he was an idiot,’ said the old man. ‘If he’d never given her any leeway in the first place but had kept her properly reined in, she’d no doubt still be living with him to this day. You mustn’t allow them any freedom from the word go. Never trust a horse in the paddock or a wife in the home.’","“That’s because he was a fool,” said the old man. “If at the very beginning he had not given her her head, but had given her a good sound scolding, she would have been all right, I tell you! A woman must not have her own way at first. Don’t trust a horse in the field or your wife in your house.”"
"«Я — честный человек, я — сын своих родителей, я — всю жизнь мечтавший о счастье семейной жизни, я — мужчина, никогда не изменявший ей… И вот пять человек детей, и она обнимает музыканта, оттого что у него красные губы!

Да что я знаю? может быть, все время это так было. Может быть, она давно с лакеями прижила всех детей, которые считаются моими. И завтра я бы приехал, и она в своей прическе, с своей этой талией и ленивыми грациозными движениями (я увидал все ее привлекательное ненавистное лицо) встретила бы меня, и зверь этот ревности навеки сидел бы у меня в сердце и раздирал бы его. Няня что подумает, Егор. И бедная Лизочка! Она уже понимала что-то.

Next to the room of the children she pretended to love all her life. And write to me what she wrote! And so brazenly throw yourself on the neck! What do I know? maybe it was like that all the time. Maybe she and her lackeys have long ago adopted all the children who are considered mine.

— Отчего же наука? — сказал я.,Why science? - I said.,‘Why science?’ I asked.,“Why science?” I asked.
"И вот для женщины только два выхода: один — сделать из себя урода, уничтожить или уничтожать в себе по мере надобности способность быть женщиной, то есть матерью, для того чтобы мужчина мог спокойно и постоянно наслаждаться; или другой выход, даже не выход, а простое, грубое, прямое нарушение законов природы, который совершается во всех так называемых честных семьях. А именно тот, что женщина, наперекор своей природе, должна быть одновременно и беременной, и кормилицей, и любовницей, должна быть тем, до чего не спускается ни одно животное. И сил не может хватить. И оттого в нашем быту истерики, нервы, а в народе — кликуши. Вы заметьте, у девушек, у чистых, нет кликушества, только у баб, и у баб, живущих с мужьями. Так у нас. Точно так же и в Европе. Все больницы истеричных полны женщин, нарушающих закон природы. Но ведь кликуши и пациентки Шарко — это совсем увечные, а полукалек женщин полон мир. Ведь только подумать, какое великое дело совершается в женщине, когда она понесла плод или когда кормит родившегося ребенка. Растет то, что продолжает, заменяет нас. И это-то святое дело нарушается — чем же? — страшно подумать! И толкуют о свободе, правах женщин. Это все равно, что людоеды откармливали бы людей пленных на еду и вместе с тем уверяли бы, что они заботятся о их правах и свободе.","And there are only two ways out for a woman: one is to make a freak out of herself, to destroy or destroy in herself, as necessary, the ability to be a woman, that is, a mother, so that a man can calmly and constantly enjoy; or another way out, not even a way out, but a simple, gross, direct violation of the laws of nature, which is committed in all so-called honest families. Namely, the fact that a woman, contrary to her nature, should be at the same time pregnant, and a nurse, and a mistress, should be something that no animal descends to. And the strength is not enough. And that is why in our life there are hysteria, nerves, and among the people - whoops. You will notice that girls, the pure ones, do not have hysteria, only women, and women who live with their husbands. So we have. The same is true in Europe. All hysterical hospitals are full of women who break the law of nature. But after all, the hysterics and patients of Charcot are completely crippled, and the world is full of half-crippled women. After all, just think what a great thing is done in a woman when she has borne a fetus or when she feeds a child that has been born. Grows what continues, replaces us. And this holy deed is being violated—with what? - scary to think! And they talk about freedom, the rights of women. It's the same as cannibals fattening captive people for food and at the same time assuring that they care about their rights and freedom.","‘And so for the woman there are really only two ways out: one is to turn herself into a freak of nature, to destroy or attempt to destroy in herself her faculty of being a woman – a mother, in other words – so that the man can continue to take his pleasure without interruption; the other isn’t really a way out at all, just a simple, gross and direct violation of the laws of nature, one that’s practised in all so-called “decent” families. In other words, the woman has to go against her nature and be expectant mother, wet-nurse and mistress all at the same time; she has to be what no animal would ever lower itself to be. And she doesn’t have the strength for it, either. That’s where all the hysteria and “nerves” come from, and it’s also the origin of the klikushi, the “possessed women” that are found among the common people. You don’t need great powers of observation to see that these klikushi are never pure young girls, but always grown women, women who have husbands. It’s the same in our class of society. It’s equally the case in Europe. All those nerve clinics are full of women who’ve broken the laws of nature. But after all, the klikushi, like the patients of Charcot, are out-and-out cripples; the world’s full of women who are only semi-crippled. To think of the great work that’s accomplished in a woman when she bears forth the fruit of her womb, or when she gives suck to the child she’s brought into the world. What’s in the process of growing there is what will give us perpetuity , what will replace us. And this sacred work is violated – by what? It’s too dreadful even to contemplate! And we carry on with our talk of freedom and women’s rights. It’s just as if a tribe of cannibals were to fatten up its captives before eating them, all the while assuring them of its concern for their rights and freedom.’","“And there are only two methods of escape for women: one is by making monsters of themselves, by destroying in themselves, according to the requirements of the case, the capacity of being women— that is, mothers—so that men may have no interruption of their enjoyment. The second escape is not an escape at all, but a simple, brutal, direct violation of the laws of nature. This is constantly taking place in all so-called good families, and it is that the woman, in direct opposition to her nature, is obliged while bearing or nursing a child to be at the same time her husband’s mistress, is obliged to be what no other animal ever permits. And she can’t have the strength for it! “Hence in our social sphere you find hysteria and nerves, and among the masses you find ‘possessed’ women. You have observed among girls, pure girls I mean, there is no such thing as ‘possession’; it is only among peasant women who live with their husbands. So it is here, and it is exactly the same all over Europe. The hospitals are full of hysterical women who have broken the laws of nature. These ‘possessed’ women and the patients of Charcot7 are complete cripples, but the world is full of half-crippled women. Think, what a mighty thing is taking place in a woman when she has conceived or when she is nursing a baby! That which is growing is to continue ourselves, is to take our place. And this holy function is violated—for what? It is terrible to think about it. And yet they talk about the freedom and the rights of women! It is as if cannibals should enjoy their prisoners as food while asserting that they were working for their freedom and rights.”"
VIII,VIII,VIII,CHAPTER VIII
"— Мужчине необходимо, — подхватил он. — Опять милые жрецы науки уверили всех. Я бы им, этим волхвам, велел исполнять должность тех женщин, которые, по их мнению, необходимы мужчинам, что бы они тогда заговорили? Внушите человеку, что ему необходима водка, табак, опиум, и все это будет необходимо. Выходит, что бог не понимал того, что нужно, и потому, не спросившись у волхвов, дурно устроил. Извольте видеть, дело не сходится. Мужчине нужно и необходимо, так решили они, удовлетворять свою похоть, а тут замешалось деторождение и кормление детей, мешающие удовлетворению этой потребности. Как же быть-то? Обратиться к волхвам, они устроят. Они и придумали. Ох, когда это развенчаются эти волхвы с своими обманами? Пора! Дошло уже вот докуда, с ума сходят и стреляются, и все от этого. Да как же иначе? Животные как будто знают, что потомство продолжает их род, и держатся известного закона в этом отношении. Только человек этого знать не знает и не хочет. И озабочен только тем, чтобы иметь как можно больше удовольствия. И это кто же? Царь природы, человек. Ведь вы заметьте, животные сходятся только тогда, когда могут производить потомство, а поганый царь природы — всегда, только бы приятно. И мало того, возводит это обезьянье занятие в перл создания, в любовь. И во имя этой любви, то есть пакости, губит — что же? — половину рода человеческого. Из всех женщин, которые должны бы быть помощницами в движении человечества к истине и благу, он во имя своего удовольствия делает не помощниц, но врагов. Посмотрите, что тормозит повсюду движение человечества вперед? Женщины. А отчего они такие? А только от этого. Да-с, да-с, — повторил он несколько раз и стал шевелиться, доставать папиросы и курить, очевидно желая несколько успокоиться.","“A man needs it,” he said. “Again, the dear priests of science assured everyone. I would have ordered them, these wise men, to fulfill the position of those women who, in their opinion, are necessary for men, what would they say then? Inspire a person that he needs vodka, tobacco, opium, and all this will be necessary. It turns out that God did not understand what was needed, and therefore, without asking the Magi, he arranged it badly. Let me see, things don't add up. A man needs and needs, so they decided, to satisfy his lust, and then procreation and feeding of children interfered with the satisfaction of this need. How can it be? Turn to the Magi, they will arrange. They came up with it. Oh, when will these wise men with their deceptions be debunked? It's time! It's gotten to the point where they're going crazy and shooting, and that's all. How else? Animals seem to know that offspring continue their race, and adhere to a certain law in this regard. Only a person does not know this and does not want to. And he is only concerned with having as much pleasure as possible. And who is this? King of nature, man. After all, you will notice that animals converge only when they can produce offspring, and the filthy king of nature always, if only it is pleasant. And what's more, it elevates this monkey occupation to the pearl of creation, to love. And in the name of this love, that is, dirty tricks, it destroys - what then? half of the human race. Of all the women who should be helpers in the movement of mankind towards truth and good, for the sake of his pleasure, he does not make helpers, but enemies. See what is hindering the progress of humanity everywhere? Women. Why are they like this? But only from this. Yes, yes, yes,"" he repeated several times and began to stir, take out cigarettes and smoke, obviously wanting to calm down somewhat.","‘Men can’t survive without it,’ he chipped in. ‘Once again our dear priests of science have managed to convince everyone that this is true. I’d like to see those witch-doctors compelled to perform the duties they say women must carry out as being so necessary to men, what would they have to say for themselves then, I wonder? Tell a man he needs vodka, tobacco and opium, and all those things will become necessities for him. The way they see it is that God had no idea of what human beings needed, and that he made a mess of things because he didn’t consult them, the witch-doctors. You only have to take a look round to see there ’s something wrong. The witch-doctors have decided that men must satisfy their lust ’ it’s a need, a necessity, and yet here are things like child-bearing and breast-feeding getting in the way. What’s to be done about it? Send for the witch-doctors, they’ll sort it out. And so they have. Oh, when will those witch-doctors and all their tricks be shown up for what they really are? It’s high time. Now it’s even got to the point where people go insane and shoot themselves, and all because of this. How can it be otherwise? The animals seem to know that their offspring assure the continuation of their species, and they stick to certain laws in this regard. It’s only man who doesn’t know these laws, and doesn’t want to know them. He’s only concerned with obtaining the greatest possible amount of pleasure. And who is this? The king of nature – man. You’ll notice that the animals copulate with one another only when if s possible for them to produce offspring; but the filthy king of nature will do it any time, just so long as it gives him pleasure. More than that: he elevates this monkey pastime into the pearl of creation, into love. And what is it that he devastates in the name of this love, this filthy abomination, rather? Half of the human race, that’s all. For the sake of his pleasure he makes women, who ought to be his helpmates in the progress of humanity towards truth and goodness, into his enemies. Just look around you: who is it that’s constantly putting a brake on humanity’s forward development? Women. And why is this so? Solely because of what I’ve been talking about. Yes, yes,’ he repeated several times, and began to rummage about in search of his cigarettes. At last he found them and lit one, in an obvious attempt to calm himself down.","But a man . . .” “Yes, yes, a man must have it,” he broke in, taking the words out of my mouth. “Again, the priests of science support you in your views. Tell a man that vodka, tobacco, opium are indispensable to him, and it will indeed become indispensable to him! It seems that God did not understand what was needful and that therefore, since He did not ask advice of the magi, He arranged things badly. The thing does not hang together! It is indispensable for a man to satisfy his carnal desires— so they decide—but the whole business of conception and nursing babies hinders the satisfaction of this necessity. How is the difficulty to be overcome? How can we manage it? Go to the magi, of course! They will arrange it! They have thought it all through! Oh, when will these magi be dethroned, along with their deceptions! It is time! You see how far things have already gone: people go mad and shoot themselves, and all from this one cause. And how could it be otherwise? Animals seem to know that their progeny perpetuate their kind, and they observe a certain law in this respect. Only man lacks the wisdom to know this, and does not want to know it! All he cares for is to have the greatest possible pleasure. And who is he? He is the ruler of nature! He is man! “Notice this: that animals enjoy intercourse only when there is to be progeny, but the vile ruler of nature does it only for pleasure’s sake, and at any time. Moreover, he idealizes this monkeylike business, and calls it the pearl of creation, love! And in the name of this love, this vileness, he destroys— what? Half of the human race! In the name of his gratifications he makes of all women, who ought to be his partners in the progress of humanity toward truth and happiness, enemies instead! Look around and tell me who everywhere acts as a hindrance to the progress of humanity—women! And what makes them so? Nothing but this! Yes, yes,” he repeated several times. He shifted his position, got out his cigarettes and began to smoke, evidently trying to calm himself a little."
"А то, что одна побольше знает математики, а другая умеет играть на арфе, — это ничего не изменит. Женщина счастлива и достигает всего, чего она может желать, когда она обворожит мужчину. И потому главная задача женщины — уметь обвораживать его. Так это было и будет. Так это в девичьей жизни в нашем мире, так продолжается и в замужней. В девичьей жизни это нужно для выбора, в замужней — для властвованья над мужем.","And the fact that one knows more mathematics, while the other knows how to play the harp, will not change anything. A woman is happy and achieves everything she can wish for when she charms a man. And therefore the main task of a woman is to be able to enchant him. So it was and will be. So it is in a girl's life in our world, so it continues in a married life. In a girl's life, this is necessary for choice, in a married life, for dominating her husband.","‘The fact that this one is rather good at mathematics, and that one can play the harp – that alters nothing. A woman’s happy and gets everything she wants when she succeeds in bewitching a man. That’s her main task in life. That’s the way it’s always been, and that’s the way it’ll go on being. A young girl in our society lives that way, and she continues to live that way after she gets married. She needs to live like this when she’s a young girl so she can make her choice, and she needs to do it when she’s a married woman so she can dominate her husband.","“The fact that this girl understands mathematics and that one plays on the harp does not change matters in the least. A woman is content and satisfied when she obtains a husband, so the chief task of woman is to learn how to snare and bewitch him. So it has been, and so it will be. Just as this is characteristic of the maiden’s life in our circle, so it continues to be even after she is married. In the maiden’s life this is necessary in order to get a choice; in the married woman’s life it is necessary in order to get power over her husband."

As if anyone needed it now!","“I sat long in that way. My mind was without a thought, without a recollection. I heard some commotion there. I heard someone arrive, then someone else.

"— А оттого, что если бы 0,01 тех усилий, которые положены на лечение сифилиса, были положены на искоренение разврата, сифилиса давно не было бы и помину. А то усилия употреблены не на искоренение разврата, а на поощрение его, на обеспечение безопасности разврата. Ну, да не в том дело. Дело в том, что со мной, да и с 0,9, если не больше, не только нашего сословия, но всех, даже крестьян, случилось то ужасное дело, что я пал не потому, что я подпал естественному соблазну прелести известной женщины. Нет, никакая женщина не соблазнила меня, а я пал потому, что окружающая меня среда видела в том, что было падение, одни — самое законное и полезное для здоровья отправление, другие — самую естественную и не только простительную, но даже невинную забаву для молодого человека. Я и не понимал, что тут есть падение, я просто начал предаваться тем отчасти удовольствиям, отчасти потребностям, которые свойственны, как мне было внушено, известному возрасту, начал продаваться этому разврату, как я начал пить, курить. А все-таки в этом первом падении было что-то особенное и трогательное. Помню, мне тотчас же, там же, не выходя из комнаты, сделалось грустно, грустно, так что хотелось плакать, плакать о погибели своей невинности, о навеки погубленном отношении к женщине. Да-с, естественное, простое отношение к женщине было погублено навеки. Чистого отношения к женщине уж у меня с тех пор не было и не могло быть. Я стал тем, что называют блудником. А быть блудником есть физическое состояние, подобное состоянию морфиниста, пьяницы, курильщика. Как морфинист, пьяница, курильщик уже не нормальный человек, так и человек, познавший нескольких женщин для своего удовольствия, уже не нормальный, а испорченный навсегда человек — блудник. Как пьяницу и морфиниста можно узнать тотчас же по лицу, по приемам, точно так же и блудника. Блудник может воздерживаться, бороться; но простого, ясного, чистого отношения к женщине, братского, у него уже никогда не будет. По тому, как он взглянет, оглядит молодую женщину, сейчас можно узнать блудника. И я стал блудником и остался таким, и это-то и погубило меня.","- And because if 0.01 of the efforts that are put into the treatment of syphilis were put into the eradication of depravity, syphilis would not have existed for a long time. Otherwise, efforts were made not to eradicate debauchery, but to encourage it, to ensure the security of debauchery. Well, that's not the point. The fact is that with me, and with 0.9, if not more, not only of our class, but of everyone, even peasants, the terrible thing happened that I did not fall because I fell under the natural temptation of the charms of a famous woman. No, no woman seduced me, and I fell because the environment around me saw in the fact that there was a fall, some - the most legitimate and healthy administration, others - the most natural and not only forgivable, but even innocent fun for the young person. I did not understand that there was a fall here, I simply began to indulge in those partly pleasures, partly needs, which are characteristic, as I was inspired, of a certain age, I began to sell myself to this depravity, as I began to drink, smoke. And yet there was something special and touching in this first fall. I remember that immediately, right there, without leaving the room, I felt sad, sad, so that I wanted to cry, cry about the death of my innocence, about the forever ruined attitude towards a woman. Yes, sir, the natural, simple attitude towards a woman was ruined forever. Since then, I have not had a pure relationship with a woman and could not have. I have become what is called a fornicator. And to be a fornicator is a physical state similar to that of a morphine addict, a drunkard, a smoker. Just as a morphine addict, a drunkard, a smoker is no longer a normal person, so a person who has known several women for his own pleasure is no longer a normal, but forever spoiled person - a fornicator. Just as a drunkard and a morphine addict can be immediately recognized by their faces and manners, so too can a fornicator. A fornicator can abstain, fight; but he will never have a simple, clear, pure attitude towards a woman, a brotherly one. By the way he looks at the young woman, now you can recognize the fornicator. And I became a fornicator and remained so, and it was this that ruined me.","‘Because if even one per cent of the effort that is put into curing syphilis were to be employed in the eradication of debauchery, syphilis would long ago have disappeared from memory. But our efforts are employed not in eradicating debauchery, but in encouraging it, making it safe. Anyway that isn’t the point. The point is that I, like nine out of ten, if not more, young men, not only in our own class but in all the others as well, even the peasantry, have had the horrible experience of falling without succumbing to the natural temptation of the charms of any one woman in particular. No, it wasn’t a case of my being seduced by a woman. I fell because the society I lived in regarded what was a fall either as a bodily function that was both legitimate and necessary for the sake of health, or as a diversion that was thoroughly natural for a young man and was not only pardonable, but even innocent. I myself didn’t know it was a fall; I simply began to indulge in something that was half pleasure and half physical necessity – both, I was assured, perfectly proper for young men of a certain age. I began to indulge in this debauchery in the same way as I began to drink and smoke. Yet there was something strangely moving about that first fall. I remember that immediately after it was over, right there in the room, I felt terribly, terribly sad; I wanted to weep, weep for my lost innocence, for my relation to women which had been forever spoiled, corrupted. Yes, the simple, natural relation I had had to women had been ruined for ever. From that day on I ceased to have a pure relation to women, nor was I any longer capable of one. I had become what is known as a fornicator. Being a fornicator is a physical condition similar to that of a morphine addict, an alcoholic or a smoker of opium. Just as a morphine addict, an alcoholic or a smoker of opium is no longer a normal individual, so a man who has had several women for the sake of his pleasure is no longer a normal person but one who has been spoiled for all time – a fornicator. And just as an alcoholic or a morphine addict can immediately be recognized by his features and physical mannerisms, so can a fornicator. A fornicator may restrain himself, struggle for self-control, but never again will his relation to women be simple, clear, pure, that of a brother to a sister. A fornicator can be instantly recognized by the intent look with which he examines a woman. I, too, became a fornicator and remained one, and that was my undoing.’","“It is certain that if one per cent of the energy employed in the cure of syphilis were expended in the eradication of lewdness, syphilis would long ago have become a memory. But instead the energy is expended, not in the eradication of lewdness, but in guaranteeing the safety of lewdness. Well, that is not the trouble. The trouble consists in this, that with me, as with nine out of ten, if not even more—not only of our class, but of all, even the peasantry—the horrible fact is that I fell, not by yielding to a single temptation of the charm of any special woman—no, no special woman led me astray—I fell because those around me saw in what was really a fall either a lawful act, a desirable regulator for the health, or a natural and simple, even innocent, diversion for a young man. “I did not even realize that this was a fall. I simply began to give myself up to those pleasures, to those necessities, which, as it was suggested to me, were natural—gave myself up to this dissipation in the same way that I had begun to drink and smoke. And yet there was something unusual and pathetic in this first fall. I remember well how immediately—even before I left that room—a feeling of sadness, deep sadness, came over me, so that I felt like weeping, weeping for the loss of my innocence, for a forever sullied relationship to womanhood. Yes, the natural, simple relationship I had enjoyed with women was now forever impossible. Purity of relationship with any woman was at an end; it could never be again. I had become what is called a libertine. And to be a libertine is to be in a physical condition like that of a drug addict, a drunkard, or a smoker. As any one of these is no longer a normal man, so a man who uses women for his own pleasure is no longer normal; he is a man forever spoiled—a libertine. As the drunkard or the addict can be instantly recognized by his face, by his actions, so it is with the rake. He may restrain himself, may struggle with his inclinations, but his simple, pure, sincere, and fraternal relations with woman are no longer possible. By the very way in which he looks at a young woman, or stares at her, the libertine is recognized. So I became a libertine, and I remained one, and that was my ruin."
"— Ну, так не угодно ли? Только крепок. — Он налил мне чаю.","- Well, don't you want to? Only strong. He poured me tea.","‘Well, would you like some tea, then? It’s strong, mind.’ He poured me a glass of tea.","“Well, then, wouldn’t you like some tea? Only it’s rather strong.” He poured me some tea."
"— Я думаю, что излишне говорить, что я был очень тщеславен: если не быть тщеславным в обычной нашей жизни, то ведь нечем жить. Ну, и в воскресенье я со вкусом занялся устройством обеда и вечера с музыкой. Я сам накупил вещей для обеда и позвал гостей.","- I think it's superfluous to say that I was very vain: if you don't be vain in our ordinary life, then there is nothing to live with. Well, on Sunday, I tastefully took up the arrangement of lunch and evening with music. I myself bought things for dinner and called the guests.","‘I think I need hardly tell you that I was very vain. In the sort of life our set leads, if a man’s not vain he doesn’t have much to live for. Well, that Sunday I went out of my way to see to it that the dinner and the musical evening were organized with the maximum possible good taste. I personally supervised the buying of the food for the dinner, and I issued all the invitations myself.","“I think it is superfluous to remark that I was very ostentatious. There would not be any living in our general society if it were not for ostentation! Thus, on that Sunday, I took the greatest pains to arrange for our dinner and for the evening musicale. I myself ordered the things for dinner and invited the guests."
"— Прощайте, — сказал я, подавая ему руку. Он подал мне руку и чуть улыбнулся, но так жалобно, что мне захотелось плакать.","“Goodbye,” I said, offering him my hand. He gave me his hand and smiled a little, but so plaintively that I wanted to cry.","‘Proshchayte, goodbye,’ I said, offering my hand. He took it, and gave me the barest smile, though it was so pathetic that I felt like crying.","“Good-bye,” I said, offering him my hand. He took it and almost smiled, but so piteously that I felt like weeping."
"Я повторил, что очень хочу. Он помолчал, потер руками лицо и начал:","I repeated that I really want to. He paused, rubbed his face with his hands, and began:","I repeated that I did, very much. He said nothing for a moment.","I assured him that I was very eager to hear him. He remained silent a little while, rubbed his face with his hands, and began."
"— На предпоследней станции, когда кондуктор пришел обирать билеты, я, собрав свои вещи, вышел на тормоз, и сознание того, что близко, вот оно решение, еще усилило мое волнение. Мне стало холодно, и я стал дрожать челюстями так, что стучал зубами. Я машинально с толпой вышел из вокзала, взял извозчика, сел и поехал. Я ехал, оглядывая редких прохожих, и дворников, и тени, бросаемые фонарями и моей пролеткой то спереди, то сзади, ни о чем не думая. Отъехав с полверсты, мне стало холодно ногам, и я подумал о том, что снял в вагоне шерстяные чулки и положил их в сумку. Где сумка? тут ли? Тут. А где корзина? Я вспомнил, что я забыл совсем о багаже, но, вспомнив и достав расписку, решил, что не стоит возвращаться за этим, и поехал дальше.","- At the penultimate station, when the conductor came to collect tickets, I gathered my things and stepped on the brakes, and the realization that it was close, here is the decision, further increased my excitement. I felt cold, and my jaws began to tremble so that my teeth chattered. I mechanically left the station with the crowd, took a cab, sat down and drove off. I drove, looking at the rare passers-by, and the janitors, and the shadows thrown by the lanterns and my cab, now in front, then behind, without thinking about anything. Having driven half a mile away, my feet felt cold, and I thought that I had taken off my woolen stockings in the carriage and put them in my bag. Where is the bag? is it here? Here. Where is the basket? I remembered that I had completely forgotten about the luggage, but, remembering and getting a receipt, I decided that it was not worth returning for this, and drove on.","‘At the station before the terminus, after the guard had been along to collect the tickets, I got my things together and went out on to the brake-platform. My awareness of what now lay close at hand – the resolution of the entire conflict – was making me even more nervous. I was cold and my jaws started to shake so that my teeth chattered. I shuffled mechanically out of the station with the rest of the crowd, hailed a cab, got into it and set off home. As we rode along I observed the few passers-by, the yard-keepers,12 the shadows thrown by the street-lamps and by my cab, now in front, now behind, and thought very hard about nothing. After we’d gone about half a verst, my feet started to feel chilled, and it came back to me that I’d taken off my long woollen socks in the train and had put them in my travelling-bag. But where was my travelling-bag? Had I left it in the train? No, I hadn’t, it was there. But where was my wicker trunk? It flashed into my mind that I’d forgotten all about my luggage. However, when I discovered that I still had the luggage ticket, I decided it wasn’t worth going back just for the trunk, and we travelled on.","“At the next to the last station, when the conductor came along to take the tickets, I picked up my belongings and went out on the platform. The realization of what was about to take place increased my agitation. I became cold, and my jaws trembled so that my teeth chattered. Mechanically I followed the crowd out of the station, engaged a driver, took my seat in his cab, and we drove away. As I drove along, glancing at the occasional pedestrians, at the watchmen and the shadows cast by the street lamps and my cab, now in front and now behind, my mind seemed a blank. By the time we had driven half a mile from the station my feet became cold; I remembered that I had removed my woolen stockings in the train and put them in my suitcase. Where was it? Had I brought it with me? Yes, I had. Where was my wicker case? Then I realized that I had entirely forgotten about my baggage, but, while I was thinking about it, I found my receipt and decided that it was not worth while returning for it, so I drove home."
"— Духовное сродство! Единство идеалов! — повторил он, издавая свой звук. — Но в таком случае незачем спать вместе (простите за грубость). А то вследствие единства идеалов люди ложатся спать вместе, — сказал он и нервно засмеялся.","- Spiritual Affinity! Unity of ideals! he repeated, making his own sound. - But in this case, there is no need to sleep together (forgive me for being rude). Otherwise, because of the unity of ideals, people go to bed together,” he said, and laughed nervously.","‘Spiritual affinity? Shared ideals?’ he repeated, making his sound again. ‘There’s not much point in going to bed together if that’s what you’re after (excuse the plain language). Do people go to bed with one another because of shared ideals?’ he said, laughing nervously.","“Spiritual affinity! Unity of ideals!” he repeated, emitting his peculiar sound. “In that case there is no reason why we should sleep together—excuse my bluntness. Is it because of this unity of ideals that people go to bed together?” he asked, laughing nervously."

"— Вам, может быть, неприятно сидеть со мной, зная, кто я? Тогда я уйду.","“Perhaps it is unpleasant for you to sit with me, knowing who I am?” Then I'll leave.","When I opened my eyes and looked at him, he suddenly turned to me with an air of resolve and exasperation: ‘I think perhaps you’re finding it unpleasant to sit next to me, since you know who I am? If that’s so, I’ll move.’","“Maybe it is disagreeable for you to be sitting with me, now that you know who I am. If that is so, I will move.”"
"— Этого не полагается, — сказал старик, — за этим смотреть надо.","- This is not supposed to, - said the old man, - you need to look after this.","‘That mustn’t happen,’ said the old man. ‘You have to be on the look-out for that kind of thing.’","“That is not to be supposed,” said the old man. “He must make sure that doesn’t happen.”"
"— Прежде этого не разбирали, — внушительным тоном сказал старик, — нынче только завелось это. Как что, она сейчас и говорит: «Я от тебя уйду». У мужиков на что, и то эта самая мода завелась. «На, говорит, вот тебе твои рубахи и портки, а я пойду с Ванькой, он кудрявей тебя». Ну вот и толкуй. А в женщине первое дело страх должен быть.","“They didn’t take it apart before,” the old man said in an impressive tone, “today it’s just started. Like what, now she says: ""I'll leave you."" The men have something, and then this very fashion started up. “Here, he says, here are your shirts and trousers, and I will go with Vanka, he is curlyer than you.” Well, here you go. And in a woman the first thing should be fear.","‘People didn’t make such a fuss about all that in the old days,’ said the merchant in a serious voice. ‘ That’s all just come in lately. First thing you hear her say nowadays is “I’m leaving you.” It’s a fashion that’s caught on even among the muzhiks. “Here you are,” she says; “here’s your shirts and trousers , I’m off with Vanka, his hair’s curlier than yours.” And it’s no good arguing with her. Whereas what ought to come first for a woman is fear.’","“In former times they did not discuss this,” said the old man in a magisterial tone. “It is only a recent development. For the least reason the wife cries out, ‘I will leave you.’ Even among the peasants this new behavior has come into fashion. ‘Here,’ says the peasant’s wife, ‘here are your shirts and drawers, but I am going off with Vanka; his hair is curlier than yours.’ Reasoning is no help. For a woman the first thing needed is fear.”"
"Я сидел наискоски и, так как поезд стоял, мог в те минуты, когда никто не проходил, слышать урывками их разговор. Купец объявил сначала о том, что он едет в свое имение, которое отстоит только на одну станцию; потом, как всегда, заговорили сначала о ценах, о торговле, говорили, как всегда, о том, как Москва нынче торгует, потом заговорили о Нижегородской ярманке. Приказчик стал рассказывать про кутежи какого-то известного обоим богача-купца на ярманке, но старик не дал ему договорить и стал сам рассказывать про былые кутежи в Кунавине, в которых он сам участвовал. Он, видимо, гордился своим участием в них и с видимой радостью рассказывал, как они вместе с этим самым знакомым сделали раз пьяные в Кунавине такую штуку, что ее надо было рассказать шепотом и что приказчик захохотал на весь вагон, а старик тоже засмеялся, оскалив два желтые зуба.","I sat obliquely and, as the train stopped, I could, in those moments when no one passed, hear snatches of their conversation. The merchant first announced that he was going to his estate, which was only one station away; then, as always, they first started talking about prices, about trade, they talked, as always, about how Moscow trades today, then they started talking about the Nizhny Novgorod Fair. The clerk began to talk about the sprees of some rich merchant known to both at the fair, but the old man did not let him finish and began to tell himself about past sprees in Kunavin, in which he himself participated. He was apparently proud of his participation in them and with visible joy told how they, together with this very acquaintance, once drunk in Kunavin, had done such a thing that it had to be told in a whisper and that the clerk laughed all over the car, and the old man also laughed, baring his teeth. two yellow teeth.","My seat was diagonally opposite theirs, and since the train was not in motion I could, when no one was passing down the carriage, overhear snatches of what they were saying. The merchant started off by telling the other man that he was on his way to visit his estate, which lay just one stop down the line; then, as such men always do, they began to discuss trade and prices, the current state of the Moscow market, and eventually, as always, they arrived at the subject of the Nizhny Novgorod summer fair.1 The salesclerk embarked on a description of the drinking and antics of a certain rich merchant they both knew, but the old man would not hear him out; instead, he began to talk about the jamborees he himself had taken part in at Kunavino2 in days gone by. Of his role in these he was evidently proud, and it was with open delight that he related how once, when he and this same mutual acquaintance had been drunk together in Kunavino, they had got up to some mischief of a kind that he could only describe in whispers. The salesclerk’s guffaw filled the entire carriage, and the old man laughed along with him, exposing a couple of yellow teeth to view.","I was sitting diagonally opposite, and since the train was stationary and no one was passing between us, I could hear snatches of their conversation. The merchant first mentioned that he was on his way to his estate, which was situated only one station distant. Then, as usual, they began to talk about prices, about trade, and about the current state of business in Moscow. After that, their conversation turned to the Fair at Nizhni-Novgorod. The clerk began to tell about the merrymaking of a rich merchant whom both of them knew at the Fair, but the old man interrupted to tell about the merrymakings which had taken place in former times at Kunavin and which he himself had enjoyed. He was evidently proud of the share he had taken in them, for with manifest delight he related how he and this same common acquaintance had once got drunk at Kunavin and played such tricks that he had to tell about them in a whisper. The clerk burst out in hearty laughter which filled the whole carriage, and the old man laughed too, revealing two yellow teeth."

It’s just that a home profits nothing from a man’s endeavours, and a woman is a fragile vessel,’ the merchant continued earnestly.","“It is not a matter of permission. The fact is that man is not the childbearer in the family; it is the woman who is the fragile vessel,” suggested the merchant."
"— Ведь главное то, чего не понимают такие люди, — сказала дама, — это то, что брак без любви не есть брак, что только любовь освящает брак и что брак истинный только тот, который освящает любовь.","“After all, the main thing that such people do not understand,” said the lady, “is that marriage without love is not marriage, that only love sanctifies marriage, and that only true marriage is that which sanctifies love.","‘What these people don’t seem to understand,’ said the lady, ‘is that marriage without love isn’t marriage at all; love is the only thing that can sanctify a marriage, and the only true marriages are those that are sanctified by love.’","“The thing these men simply cannot understand,” said the lady, “is that marriage without love just is not marriage, that love alone consecrates marriage, and that the only true marriage is that which love consecrates.”"
"В один вечер, после того как мы ездили в лодке и ночью, при лунном свете, ворочались домой и я сидел рядом с ней и любовался ее стройной фигурой, обтянутой джерси, и ее локонами, я вдруг решил, что это она. Мне показалось в этот вечер, что она понимает все, все, что я чувствую и думаю, а что чувствую я и думаю самые возвышенные вещи. В сущности же, было только то, что джерси было ей особенно к лицу, также и локоны, и что после проведенного в близости с нею дня захотелось еще большей близости.","One evening, after we had been out in the boat and at night, in the moonlight, tossing and turning home, and I was sitting next to her and admiring her slim figure, covered in jersey, and her curls, I suddenly decided that it was her. It seemed to me that evening that she understands everything, everything that I feel and think, and what I feel and think is the most sublime things. In fact, it was only that the jersey suited her especially, and the curls as well, and that after spending a day in closeness with her, she wanted even more intimacy.","‘One evening after we’d been out boating and were going home together in the moonlight, I sat beside her and admired her curls and her shapely figure, hugged by the tight silk of the stockinet dress she was wearing. I suddenly decided that she was the one. That evening it seemed to me that she understood everything, all I was thinking and feeling, and that all my thoughts and feelings were of the most exalted kind. All it really was was that silk stockinet happened to suit her particularly well, as did curls, and that after a day spent close to her I wanted to get even closer.","One evening, after we had been out in a boat and were returning home by moonlight, I was sitting alongside her and admiring her well-proportioned figure clad in a jersey, and her attractive curls, when suddenly I made up my mind that she was the one.

In reality it was simply that her jersey was especially becoming to her, and so were her curls, and that, having spent a day in her immediate presence, I wanted to be even closer to her."

"— Целый день этот я не говорил с ней, не мог. Близость ее вызывала во мне такую ненависть к ней, что я боялся себя. За обедом она при детях спросила меня о том, когда я еду. Мне надо было на следующей неделе ехать на съезд в уезд. Я сказал когда. Она спросила, не нужно ли мне чего на дорогу. Я не сказал ничего и молча просидел за столом и молча же ушел в кабинет. Последнее время она никогда не приходила ко мне в комнату, особенно в это время. Лежу в кабинете и злюсь. Вдруг знакомая походка. И в голову мне приходит страшная, безобразная мысль о том, что она, как жена Урии, хочет скрыть уже совершенный грех свой и что она затем в такой неурочный час идет ко мне. «Неужели она идет ко мне?» — думал я, слушая ее приближающиеся шаги. Если ко мне, то я прав, значит. И в душе поднимается невыразимая ненависть к ней. Ближе, ближе шаги. Неужели не пройдет мимо, в залу? Нет, дверь скрипнула, и в дверях ее высокая, красивая фигура, и в лице, в глазах — робость и заискивание, которое она хочет скрыть, но которое я вижу и значение которого я знаю. Я чуть не задохнулся, так долго я удерживал дыханье, и, продолжая глядеть на нее, схватился за папиросочницу и стал закуривать.","“I didn’t talk to her all day, I couldn’t. Her proximity aroused such hatred in me for her that I was afraid of myself. At dinner, in front of the children, she asked me about when I was going. I had to go to the county convention next week. I said when. She asked if I needed anything for the journey. I said nothing and silently sat at the table and silently went into the study. Lately, she has never come to my room, especially at this time. I lie in the office and get angry. Suddenly a familiar gait. And a terrible, ugly thought comes into my head that she, as the wife of Uriah, wants to hide her already committed sin and that she then comes to me at such an inopportune hour. ""Is she coming to me?"" I thought as I listened to her approaching footsteps. If to me, then I'm right, then. And an inexpressible hatred for her rises in the soul. Closer, closer steps. Will he not pass by, into the hall? No, the door creaked, and in the doorway was her tall, beautiful figure, and in her face, in her eyes - timidity and fawning, which she wants to hide, but which I see and the meaning of which I know. I almost suffocated, I held my breath for so long, and, continuing to look at her, I grabbed the cigarette box and began to smoke.","‘All that day I didn’t say a word to my wife – I couldn’t. The mere sight of her aroused such hatred in me that I even frightened myself. At dinner she asked me in front of the children when it was I was leaving. The following week I was due to travel to the provinces to attend a meeting of the local zemstvo.9 I told her the date of my departure. She asked me if I needed anything for the journey. I made no reply, but sat at the table for a while in silence, and then, just as silently, went off to my study. During those last days she never came into my room, particularly at that hour. I lay there in my study, fuming with anger. Suddenly I heard familiar footsteps. And into my head came the terrible outrageous thought that, like the wife of Uriah, she wanted to conceal the sin she had already committed, and that with this purpose in view she was coming to see me in my room at this unprecedented hour. “Can she really be coming to my room?” I wondered, as I listened to her approaching footsteps. “If she is, it means I was right.” And an unutterable hatred of her arose within me. The footsteps came nearer, nearer. Perhaps she would go past, into the ballroom? No, the door creaked, and there in the doorway was her tall, beautiful silhouette. Her face and eyes had a timid, ingratiating look which she was trying to conceal but which was evident to me and the meaning of which I knew only too well. I had nearly choked, so long had I held my breath, and, continuing to look at her, I grabbed my cigarette case and lit a cigarette. ‘“Well, what’s this?","“That whole day I did not speak to her—I could not. Her presence produced such hatred of her that I feared for my control. At dinner, in the presence of the children, she asked me when I was going away. My duties called me the following week to a meeting of the District Council. I told her when. She asked me if I needed anything for my journey. I did not say anything; I sat in silence at the table, and then silently went to my study. Of late she had stopped coming to my study, especially at that time of day. I was lying down, bitterly angry. Suddenly I heard her steps. The terrible, ugly thought leaped to my brain that she, like Uriah’s wife,10 had already committed the sin and wanted to hide it —that was why she was coming to me! ‘ Can it be that she is really coming to me?’ I asked myself as I heard her approaching. ‘If she is coming to me, then it means I am right.’ An ineffable hatred of her arose in my soul. Nearer, nearer came her steps. ‘Can it be that she is going by into the hall?’ “No, the door creaked and her tall, handsome figure appeared; her face, her eyes expressed timidity and a desire to make up, as I could easily see. I understood the significance of her behavior perfectly. I almost suffocated, so long I held my breath, and continuing to stare at her, I grasped my cigarette case and began to smoke."
"И точно, я не успел дойти до конца вагонов, как раздался звонок. Когда я вернулся, между дамой и адвокатом продолжался оживленный разговор. Старый купец молча сидел напротив них, строго глядя перед собой и изредка неодобрительно жуя зубами.","And sure enough, I did not have time to reach the end of the cars, when the bell rang. When I returned, a lively conversation continued between the lady and the lawyer. The old merchant sat silently opposite them, gazing sternly ahead of him and occasionally chewing his teeth disapprovingly.","And so it was: before I had even reached the end of the line of carriages the bell rang.

"Я вырвал руку и молча бросился к нему. Его глаза встретились с моими, он вдруг побледнел как полотно, до губ, глаза сверкнули как-то особенно, и, чего я тоже никак не ожидал, он шмыгнул под фортепиано, в дверь. Я бросился было за ним, но на левой руке моей повисла тяжесть. Это была она. Я рванулся. Она еще тяжелее повисла и не выпускала. Неожиданная эта помеха, тяжесть и ее отвратительное мне прикосновение еще больше разожгли меня. Я чувствовал, что я вполне бешеный и должен быть страшен, и радовался этому. Я размахнулся изо всех сил левой рукой и локтем попал ей в самое лицо. Она вскрикнула и выпустила мою руку. Я хотел бежать за ним, но вспомнил, что было бы смешно бежать в чулках за любовником своей жены, а я не хотел быть смешон, а хотел быть страшен. Несмотря на страшное бешенство, в котором я находился, я помнил все время, какое впечатление я произвожу на других, и даже это впечатление отчасти руководило мною. Я повернулся к ней. Она упала на кушетку и, схватившись рукой за расшибленные мною глаза, смотрела на меня. В лице ее были страх и ненависть ко мне, к врагу, как у крысы, когда поднимают мышеловку, в которую она попалась. Я, по крайней мере, ничего не видел в ней, кроме этого страха и ненависти ко мне. Это был тот самый страх и ненависть ко мне, которые должна была вызвать любовь к другому. Но еще, может быть, я удержался бы и не сделал бы того, что я сделал, если бы она молчала. Но она вдруг начала говорить и хватать меня рукой за руку с кинжалом.","I tore my hand away and silently rushed towards him. His eyes met mine, he suddenly turned pale as a sheet, to the lips, his eyes sparkled somehow especially, and, which I also did not expect at all, he darted under the piano, through the door. I rushed after him, but a weight hung on my left arm. It was her. I rushed. She hung even harder and did not let go. This unexpected hindrance, the heaviness, and her repulsive touch inflamed me even more. I felt that I was quite mad and should be scary, and I rejoiced at this. I swung with all my might with my left arm and my elbow hit her in the face. She screamed and released my hand. I wanted to run after him, but I remembered that it would be funny to run after my wife's lover in stockings, and I didn't want to be ridiculous, but I wanted to be scary. In spite of the terrible fury in which I was, I remembered all the time what impression I made on others, and even this impression partly guided me. I turned to her. She fell on the couch and, grabbing her hand over my bruised eyes, looked at me. In her face were fear and hatred for me, for the enemy, like a rat when they pick up a mousetrap in which she has fallen. I, at least, did not see anything in her, except for this fear and hatred of me. It was the same fear and hatred for me that love for another was supposed to evoke. But also, maybe I would have restrained myself and would not have done what I did if she had kept silent. But she suddenly began to speak and grab my hand with a dagger.","‘I wrenched my arm free and went for him without a word. His eyes met mine, and suddenly he turned as white as a sheet, even his lips turned pale; his eyes started to glitter in a peculiar way, and then suddenly – this was something else I hadn’t been expecting – he ducked under the piano and was out of the room in a flash. I was about to rush after him, but there was something weighing me down by my left arm. It was her. I tried to pull myself away, but she hung on to me even more heavily and wouldn’t let go. This unexpected impediment, her weight and the physical contact with her, which I found revolting, inflamed me even further. I was in a rabid frenzy, and I knew I must be a fearful sight, and was glad of it. I swung my left arm round as hard as I could, and my elbow struck her full in the face. She screamed and let go of my arm. I wanted to run after him, but I reflected that it would be ridiculous to run after one’s wife’s lover in one’s stockinged feet; I didn’t want to look ridiculous, I wanted to look terrifying. In spite of the terrible fury that gripped me, I was constantly aware of the impression I was making on others, and this consideration even guided my actions to a certain extent. I turned and looked at her. She’d slumped on to a chaise-longue; snatching with one hand at her eyes, which I’d hurt, she was observing me. In her face there was fear and hatred of me: I was the enemy. It was the kind of fear and hatred that could only be inspired by her love for another man. Yet I might still have held myself in check and not done what I did, if only she hadn’t said anything. But she suddenly began to speak, as she attempted to seize the hand in which I was holding the poniard.","“I wrenched away my arm and without saying a word rushed at him. His eyes met mine. He suddenly turned as pale as a sheet, even to the lips. His eyes glittered with a peculiar light. Suddenly he slipped under the piano and darted out the door. I started to rush after him, but I was held back by a pull on my left arm. It was she! I tried to break away. She clung all the more heavily to my arm and would not let me go. This unexpected hindrance—the weight of her, her touch which was repulsive to me—still further inflamed my anger! I was conscious of being in a complete frenzy and that I ought to be terrifying—and I exulted in it. I drew back my left arm with all my might and struck her full in the face with my elbow. She screamed and let go my arm. I started to chase him, but remembered that it would be ridiculous for a man to chase his wife’s lover in his stockings. I did not want to be ridiculous; I wanted to be fearful. “Notwithstanding the terrible frenzy in which I found myself, I never for an instant forgot the impression I might produce on others, and this impression, to a certain degree, governed me. I came back to her. She had fallen on a couch, and with her hand held up to her eyes, which I had bruised, was looking at me, her enemy, as a rat might when the trap in which it had been caught is picked up. I could see nothing else in her face except terror and hatred—precisely the same which love for another would evoke. Possibly I would have restrained myself and not done what I did if she had held her tongue. But she suddenly began to speak, and she seized my hand which held the dagger: ‘Come to your senses!"
"— Ну вот, так-то и меня поймали. Я был то, что называется, влюблен. Я не только представлял ее себе верхом совершенства, я и себя за это время моего жениховства представлял тоже верхом совершенства. Ведь нет того негодяя, который, поискав, не нашел бы негодяев в каком-нибудь отношении хуже себя и который поэтому не мог бы найти повода гордиться и быть довольным собой. Так и я: я женился не на деньгах — корысть была ни при чем, не так, как большинство моих знакомых женились из-за денег или связей, — я был богат, она бедна. Это одно. Другое, чем я гордился, было то, что другие женились с намерением вперед продолжать жить в таком же многоженстве, в каком они жили до брака; я же имел твердое намерение держаться после свадьбы единобрачия, и не было пределов моей гордости перед собой за это. Да, свинья я был ужасная и воображал себе, что я ангел.","Well, that's how they caught me. I was what is called in love. I not only imagined her to be the height of perfection, I also imagined myself during this time of my marriage as the height of perfection. After all, there is no scoundrel who, having searched, would not find scoundrels in some respects worse than himself, and who therefore could not find a reason to be proud and be pleased with himself. So did I: I did not marry for money - self-interest had nothing to do with it, not like most of my acquaintances got married because of money or connections - I was rich, she was poor. This is one. Another thing I was proud of was that others married with the intention of continuing to live in the same polygamy in which they lived before marriage; I had the firm intention of holding on to monogamy after the wedding, and there were no limits to my pride in myself for this. Yes, I was a terrible pig and imagined that I was an angel.","‘Well, anyway, that’s how I too was caught. I was what’s called “in love”. It wasn’t just that I thought she was the acme of perfection – during the time I was engaged to her I thought I was the acme of perfection, too. After all, there’s no good-for-nothing who, after looking round for a bit, can’t find other good-for-nothings worse than himself in certain respects, and thus find a reason for pride and self-congratulation. That’s the way it was with me: I wasn’t marrying for money – material interests weren’t involved as they were for the majority of my friends, who were getting married for the sake of either money or connections – I was rich, she was poor. The other thing I was proud of was that while my friends were all getting married with the intention of continuing to live in polygamy as they had done before, I had the firm intention of remaining monogamous after my wedding – and my pride in this knew no bounds. Yes, I was a dirty pig, and I thought I was an angel.","“Now, then, you understand, I was what is called ‘in love.’ I not only imagined her as absolute perfection, I also imagined myself at the time of my marriage as absolute perfection. You see, there is no scoundrel who cannot—if he searches hard enough—find a scoundrel in some respects worse than himself, and so he finds an excuse for pride and self-satisfaction. So it was with me: I was not marrying for money, it was not a question of advantage with me (as it was with most of my acquaintances, who married either for money or connections). I was rich; she was poor. That was one thing. Another thing which gave me reason for pride was the fact that, while other men married with the intention of continuing to live in the same polygamy as they had enjoyed up to the time of their marriage, I had firmly resolved to live after my marriage as a monogamist—and my pride had no bounds in consequence of this resolution. Yes, I was a swine, but I saw myself as an angel!"
"— Что надо? — грубо спросил я. Я видел, что совсем не надо было и незачем было быть с ней грубым, но я не мог придумать никакого другого тона.","— What do you need? I asked rudely. I saw that there was absolutely no need and no reason to be rude to her, but I could think of no other tone.","‘“What do you want?” I asked her, rudely. I knew there was absolutely no excuse for my being rude to her, nor would any purpose be served by it, but I couldn’t think of any other tone of voice to adopt.","“ ‘What do you want?’ I asked harshly. I saw that this was entirely unnecessary and that I had no reason to be gruff with her, but I could not adopt any other tone."
"К утру она успокоилась, и мы помирились под влиянием того чувства, которое мы называли любовью.","By morning she calmed down, and we reconciled under the influence of that feeling that we called love.","‘Towards dawn she calmed down, and we had a reconciliation under the influence of the feeling to which we gave the name “love”.","Toward morning she grew calm, and we had a reconciliation under the influence of that passion we call love."

"Вечером он приехал со скрипкой, и они играли. Но игра долго не ладилась, не было тех нот, которые им были нужны, а которые были, жена не могла играть без приготовлений. Я очень любил музыку и сочувствовал их игре, устраивал ему пюпитр, переворачивал страницы. И кое-что они сыграли, какие-то песни без слов и сонатку Моцарта. Он играл превосходно, и у него было в высшей степени то, что называется тоном. Кроме того, тонкий, благородный вкус, совсем несвойственный его характеру.","In the evening he came with a violin and they played. But the game did not go well for a long time, there were no those notes that they needed, and which were, the wife could not play without preparations.

And they managed to play a few pieces: some songs without words, and a Mozart sonata. He played excellently, with what they call a good tone. More than that: he played with a refinement and nobility of taste that were quite out of keeping with the rest of his character.","“In the evening he came with his violin and they played together.

"И я лег в постель и стал думать о делах, предстоящих на завтра. Мне всегда долго не спалось во время этих съездов, на новом месте, но тут я заснул очень скоро. И как это бывает, знаете, вдруг толчок электрический, и просыпаешься. Так я проснулся, и проснулся с мыслью о ней, о моей плотской любви к ней, и о Трухачевском, и о том, что между нею и им все кончено. Ужас и злоба стиснули мне сердце. Но я стал образумливать себя. «Что за вздор, — говорил я себе, — нет никаких оснований, ничего нет и не было. И как я могу так унижать ее и себя, предполагая такие ужасы. Что-то вроде наемного скрипача, известный за дрянного человека, и вдруг женщина почтенная, уважаемая мать семейства, моя жена! Что за нелепость!» — представлялось мне с одной стороны. «Как же этому не быть?» — представлялось мне с другой. Как же могло не быть то самое простое и понятное, во имя чего я женился на ней, то самое, во имя чего я с нею жил, чего одного в ней нужно было и мне и чего поэтому нужно было и другим и этому музыканту. Он человек неженатый, здоровый (помню, как он хрустел хрящом в котлетке и обхватывал жадно красными губами стакан с вином), сытый, гладкий, и не только без правил, но, очевидно, с правилами о том, чтобы пользоваться теми удовольствиями, которые представляются. И между ними связь музыки, самой утонченной похоти чувств. Что же может удержать его? Ничто. Все, напротив, привлекает его. Она? Да кто она? Она тайна, как была, так и есть. Я не знаю ее. Знаю ее только как животное. А животное ничто не может, не должно удержать.","And I went to bed and began to think about the things that were coming up for tomorrow. I always could not sleep for a long time during these congresses, in a new place, but here I fell asleep very soon. And how it happens, you know, suddenly an electric shock, and you wake up. So I woke up, and woke up with the thought of her, of my carnal love for her, and of Trukhachevsky, and that everything was over between her and him. Horror and anger gripped my heart. But I began to reason with myself. “What nonsense,” I said to myself, “there are no grounds, there is nothing and never was. And how can I humiliate her and myself in such a way, assuming such horrors. Something like a hired violinist, known for being a mean person, and suddenly a respectable woman, a respected mother of the family, my wife! What an absurdity!” - it seemed to me on the one hand. ""How can this not be?"" - it seemed to me on the other. How could there not be that very simple and understandable thing in the name of which I married her, the very thing in the name of which I lived with her, what alone I needed in her and what, therefore, others and this musician also needed. He is an unmarried man, healthy (I remember how he crunched cartilage in a cutlet and greedily cupped a glass of wine with his red lips), well-fed, smooth, and not only without rules, but, obviously, with rules on how to enjoy those pleasures that are presented . And between them is the connection of music, the most refined lust of feelings. What can keep him? Nothing. Everything, on the contrary, attracts him. She is? Who is she? She is a mystery, as she was, and is. I do not know her. I only know her as an animal. And nothing can, should not hold an animal.","‘And I lay down on the bed and began to think about the matters I had to attend to the following day. I always had a lot of trouble getting to sleep when I was away at those zemstvo meetings – it also had to do with the unfamiliar surroundings – out on this occasion I managed to fall asleep almost at once. But then – you know the way it sometimes happens, that you’re seized by a sort of electric shock, and you wake up? I woke up like that, with my head full of thoughts about her, about my carnal love for her, about Trukhachevsky and about the two of them making love together. I shrank inwardly with rage and horror. But I began to reason with myself. “What rubbish,” I told myself. “You’ve got absolutely no grounds for thinking like that, nothing of the kind’s happening, nor has it happened already. And how can you humiliate yourself and her by supposing such horrors? Some hired fiddler, known to be a worthless individual, suddenly taking up with an honourable woman, the respectable mother of a family, my wife? What an absurdity!” was what one part of me was thinking. “How could it possibly be otherwise?” was what the other part thought. “There couldn’t be anything more simple or straightforward: it was for the sake of that simple, straightforward thing that I married her, first the sake of it that I’ve lived with her , it’s the only thing about her which I actually want and which other men, including that musician, therefore also want. He’s an unmarried man, in good health (I can still remember the way he used to crunch the gristle in his chop and greedily seize the rim of his wineglass in his red lips), sleek and well fed, and not merely quite without principles but obviously an adherent of certain special ideas of his own about how best to take full advantage of the pleasures that came his way. And between them they have the bond of music, the most refined form of sensual lust. What can possibly hold him back? Nothing. On the contrary, everything is drawing him in that direction. Would she be able to hold him back? I don’t even know who she is. She’s a mystery, just as she’s always been, just as she’ll always be. I don’t know her. I only know her as an animal. And nothing can or should hold an animal back.”","“And I lay on my bed and tried to plan the business to attend to the next day. I never go to sleep very quickly in a new place, but this time I fell asleep almost immediately. But as often happens, I suddenly felt something like an electric shock and started up wide awake. As I woke, I woke with a thought of her, of my carnal love for her, and of Trukhashevsky, and of all that had gone on between him and her. Horror and rage crushed my heart! I tried to reason myself out of it. “ ‘What rubbish!’ I exclaimed. ‘There is not the slightest basis for any such suspicions. And how can I humiliate myself and her by harboring such horrible thoughts? Here is a hired fiddler, with a reputation of being worthless. Could a respectable woman, the mother of a family, my wife, suddenly fall a victim to such a man? What an absurdity!’ “That is what I argued on one side, but on the other came these thoughts: ‘How could it fail to be so? Why is it not the simplest and most comprehensible thing? Was it not for that I married her? Was it not for that I lived with her? Was it not that which makes me necessary to her? And would not another man, this musician, be likewise necessary to her? He is an unmarried man, healthy —I remember how lustily he crunched the gristle in the cutlet and put the glass of wine to his red lips —he is well-fed, and he is not only without principles but evidently guided by the theory that it is best to take advantage of whatever pleasures present themselves. And between them is the tie of music, the subtle lust of the senses. What can restrain him? She? Yes, but who is she? She is as much a riddle as she has ever been. I don’t know her. I know her only as an animal, and nothing can restrain an animal or is likely to.’"
"Чай действительно был как пиво, но я выпил стакан. В это время прошел кондуктор. Он проводил его молча злыми глазами и начал только тогда, когда тот ушел.","The tea was really like beer, but I drank the glass. At that moment the conductor passed. He followed him silently with angry eyes and began only when he left.","The tea was the colour of tar, but I swilled down a glass of it all the same. Just then the guard passed down the carriage. Pozdnyshev followed him angrily with his gaze and did not start speaking again until he was gone.","The tea was really like dark beer, but I drank a glass of it. At this moment the conductor came along. Pozdnyshev silently watched him with angry eyes, and did not begin until he had left the car."
"Нечему угрызать, потому что совести в нашем быту нет никакой, кроме, если можно так назвать, совести общественного мнения и уголовного закона. А тут и та и другая не нарушаются: совеститься перед обществом нечего, все это делают: и Марья Павловна и Иван Захарыч. А то что ж разводить нищих или лишать себя возможности общественной жизни? Совеститься перед уголовным законом или бояться его тоже нечего. Это безобразные девки и солдатки бросают детей в пруды и колодцы; тех, понятно, надо сажать в тюрьму, а у нас все делается своевременно и чисто.","There is nothing to reproach, because there is no conscience in our everyday life, except, if you can call it that, the conscience of public opinion and the criminal law. And here both are not violated: there is nothing to be ashamed of before society, everyone does it: both Marya Pavlovna and Ivan Zakharych. But what about breeding beggars or depriving yourself of the opportunity of social life? There is nothing to be ashamed of before the criminal law or to be afraid of it either. These ugly girls and soldiers throw children into ponds and wells; those, of course, should be put in jail, but in our country everything is done in a timely and clean manner.","‘There’s no remorse left because in our section of society there’s no moral conscience except the conscience – if you can call it that – represented by public consensus and criminal law. Yet neither of these are violated. There’s no reason for anyone to feel guilty in the face of public opinion, since everyone, from Marya Pavlovna to Ivan Zakharych, does it. Why should one add to the number of paupers there already are, or deprive oneself of the possibility of leading a social life? No more is there any reason to feel guilty in the face of the criminal law or to be afraid of it. It’s only whores and soldiers’ wives who drown their children in ponds or throw them down wells; they, of course, should be locked up in prison, but we do it all in our own good time and without any mess.","“No one feels any conscientious scruples, because conscience is a non-existent quality except—if we may so say—the ‘conscience’ of public opinion and of criminal law. And in this respect neither the one nor the other is violated; no one has to bear the brunt of public scorn, for all—including Marya Pavlovna and Ivan Zakharych—do the same thing. Why breed beggars or deprive oneself of the possibility of social life? Is there any reason to stand in awe of the criminal law or to fear it? Peasant girls and soldiers’ wives throw their babies into ponds and wells and they must go to prison, but all that sort of thing is done by us properly and neatly!"
"И она ведь не лгала, она верила в то, что говорила; она надеялась словами этими вызвать в себе презрение к нему и защитить им себя от него, но ей не удалось это. Все было направлено против нее, в особенности эта проклятая музыка. Так все и кончилось, и в воскресенье собрались гости, и они опять играли.","And she didn't lie, she believed what she said; she hoped with these words to arouse in herself contempt for him and protect herself from him with it, but she did not succeed. Everything was directed against her, especially that damned music. So it all ended, and on Sunday the guests gathered, and they played again.","‘And, you know, she wasn’t lying, she really believed what she was saying. By saying this she was hoping to make herself feel contempt for him, and so protect herself from him, but she couldn’t manage it. Everything was against her, particularly that damned music. So that’s how it all ended up: on Sunday evening the guests arrived as invited, and the two of them played together again.’","“And evidently she was not lying. She believed in what she was saying; she hoped by these words to evoke in herself scorn for him and to defend herself from him, but she did not succeed in this. Everything went against her, especially that cursed music. “Thus the episode ended, and on Sunday the guests gathered and they played together again."
"Он был, разумеется, гораздо сильнее жены и помогал ей и вместе с тем учтиво хвалил ее игру. Он держал себя очень хорошо. Жена казалась заинтересованной только одной музыкой и была очень проста и естественна. Я же, хотя и притворялся заинтересованным музыкой, весь вечер не переставая мучался ревностью.","He was, of course, much stronger than his wife and helped her and at the same time politely praised her game. He behaved very well. The wife seemed interested in only one music and was very simple and natural. I, though pretending to be interested in the music, was constantly tormented by jealousy all evening.","‘He was, of course, a far better player than my wife, and he helped her along, at the same time managing to say nice things about her playing. He was a model of good behaviour. My wife seemed only to be interested in the music, and she behaved in a simple, natural sort of way. I, on the other hand, although I pretended to be interested in the music, spent the entire evening being tortured by jealousy.","“He was, of course, far better than my wife, so he helped her and at the same time politely praised her playing. He behaved very well. My wife seemed interested only in the music, and was very simple and natural.

"— Да, я все увлекаюсь, — начал он. — Много я передумал, на многое я смотрю по-иному, и все это хочется сказать. Ну, и стали жить в городе. В городе несчастным людям жить лучше. В городе человек может прожить сто лет и не хватиться того, что он давно умер и сгнил. Разбираться с самим собой некогда, все занято. Дела, общественные отношения, здоровье, искусства, здоровье детей, их воспитанье. То надо принимать тех и этих, ехать к тем и этим; то надо посмотреть эту, послушать этого или эту. Ведь в городе во всякий данный момент есть одна, а то сразу две, три знаменитости, которые нельзя никак пропустить. То надо лечить себя, того или этого, то учителя, репетиторы, гувернантки, а жизнь пустым-пустешенька. Ну, так мы и жили и меньше чувствовали боль от сожития. Кроме того, первое время было чудесное занятие — устройство в новом городе, на новой квартире, и еще занятие — переездов из города в деревню и из деревни в город.","“Yes, I’m getting carried away,” he began. - I have changed my mind a lot, I look at many things differently, and I want to say all this. Well, they began to live in the city. Unhappy people live better in the city. A man can live in a city for a hundred years and not miss the fact that he died and rotted long ago. There is no time to deal with oneself, everything is busy. Affairs, public relations, health, arts, health of children, their upbringing. It is necessary to accept those and these, go to these and those; then you need to see this one, listen to this one or this one. Indeed, in the city at any given moment there is one, or even two or three celebrities at once, who cannot be missed in any way. Either you need to treat yourself, this or that, then teachers, tutors, governesses, and life is empty-empty. Well, that's how we lived and felt less pain from cohabitation. In addition, at first it was a wonderful occupation - settling in a new city, in a new apartment, and another occupation - moving from city to village and from village to city.","‘Yes, I keep getting led off the point,’ he said when he had sat down again. ‘I’ve changed a lot of the ideas I used to have, there are a lot of things I see differently now, and I have this need to talk about it all. Well, anyway, we went to live in town. Life’s more bearable for unhappy people there. In town a man can live for a hundred years and never notice that he’s long been dead and buried. There’s never any time to study your conscience; you’re busy all the time. There’s business, social life, looking after your health, keeping up with the arts, attending to the health of your children, arranging their education. One moment you may have to receive this person, go and visit that person; the next, you may have to go and see this or that exhibition, attend this or that concert. You know how it is: at any given moment there are one, two or even three celebrities in town whom you simply mustn’t miss. One moment you’re taking some treatment or other, or arranging treatment for somebody else; the next, it’s teachers, tutors, governesses, and yet life is as empty as it can possibly be. Well, that’s how we lived, and that way we didn’t feel so acutely the pain caused by the fact of our living together. More than that: in those early days we were kept busy in the most marvellous fashion, setting ourselves up in a new town, in a new apartment, with the added diversion of trips from the town to the country and back again.","“Yes, I keep wandering from my story,” he began. “I have pondered over it a good deal. I look on many things in a different way from what most people do, and I want to talk it all out. “Well, we began to live in the city. There a man may live a century and never realize that he has long ago died and rotted. One has no time to study himself—his time is wholly occupied: business, social relations, his health, art, the health of his children, their education. Now he must receive calls from such and such people; now he must return them; now he must see this woman; now he must hear that man. At any given moment there will surely be in the city one celebrity, generally several, whom it is impossible for you to miss. Now you have to consult a doctor for yourself or for this one or that; then you have to see one of the tutors or the governess, and so life is frittered away. Well, so it was we lived and seemed to suffer less from our life together. Moreover, we had at first the pleasant business of getting settled in a new city, in a new home, and then, later, in traveling back and forth between the city and the country."
"А жизнь дома идет. Приходит гувернантка, спрашивает: «Где madame? когда вернется?» Лакей спрашивает, подавать ли чай. Прихожу в столовую; дети, в особенности старшая Лиза, которая уж понимает, вопросительно и недоброжелательно смотрит на меня. Пьем молча чай. Ее все нет. Проходит весь вечер, ее нет, и два чувства сменяются в душе: злоба к ней за то, что она мучает меня и всех детей своим отсутствием, которое кончится же тем, что она приедет, и страх того, что она не приедет и что-нибудь сделает над собой. Я бы поехал за ней. Но где искать ее? У сестры? Но это глупо приехать спрашивать. Да и бог с ней; если она хочет мучать, пускай сама мучается. А то ведь она этого и ждет. И в следующий раз будет еще хуже. А что, как она не у сестры, а что-нибудь делает или уже сделала над собой?.. Одиннадцать, двенадцать, час. Не иду в спальню, глупо одному там лежать и ждать, и тут же ложусь. Хочу чем-нибудь заняться, написать письма, читать; ничего не могу. Сижу один в кабинете, мучаюсь, злюсь и прислушиваюсь. Три, четыре часа — ее все нет. К утру засыпаю. Просыпаюсь- ее нет.","And home life goes on. The governess comes and asks: “Where is madame? when will he return?"" The footman asks if tea is to be served. I come to the dining room; the children, especially the eldest Lisa, who already understands, looks at me inquiringly and unkindly. We drink tea in silence. She's all gone. The whole evening passes, she is gone, and two feelings alternate in my soul: anger towards her because she torments me and all the children with her absence, which will end with her coming, and fear that she will not come, and something will do something for himself. I would follow her. But where to look for her? At the sister? But it's stupid to come and ask. Yes, and God bless her; If she wants to torment, let her torment herself. And that's what she's waiting for. And next time it will be even worse. And what if she is not with her sister, but is doing something or has already done something on herself? .. Eleven, twelve, one. I don’t go to the bedroom, it’s stupid to lie there alone and wait, and I immediately go to bed. I want to do something, write letters, read; I can't do anything. I sit alone in the office, suffer, get angry and listen. Three, four hours - she's still gone. I fall asleep in the morning. I wake up and she's gone.","‘But the life of the household went on as before. The governess arrived, and asked “Where’s madame? When’s she coming back?” The butler appeared, to ask if he should serve the tea. I went into the dining-room; the children, especially Liza, the eldest girl, who already knew what was going on, looked at me questioningly and disapprovingly. We sipped our tea in silence. She still hadn’t returned. The whole evening passed, she still didn’t come back, and two emotions kept alternating inside me: animosity towards her making my life and the lives of all the children a misery by her absence when I knew she intended to come back again; and fear that she might not come back, that she might do away with herself. I wanted to go and look for her. But where would I look? At her sister’s? It would have been stupid to go there asking for her. Oh, let her go: if she wanted to make our lives a misery, let her make her own life miserable too. That was probably what she wanted, anyway. And next time it would be even worse. But what if she wasn’t at her sister’s, what if she was trying to do away with herself, or had even done so already? Eleven o’clock, twelve, one a.m. I didn’t go into our bedroom, it would have been stupid to lie there alone, waiting, and I didn’t want to sleep in my study. I wanted to be busy with something, write letters, read; I couldn’t do anything. I sat alone in my study, suffering, angry, listening. Three a.m., four a.m. – still no sign of her. Towards morning I fell asleep. When I woke up, she still wasn’t back.","“But life at home goes on. The governess comes and asks, ‘Where is madame? When will she be back?’ The butler asks, ‘Shall I serve tea?’ “I go into the dining room. The children—especially the oldest one, Lisa, who is already old enough to understand—look at me questioningly, disapprovingly. We silently drink our tea. There is no sign of her. The evening passes; she does not come. Two thoughts mingle in my soul: wrath because she is tormenting me and the children by her absence—and yet, she will return in the end—and fear that she will not come back, that she will kill herself. “I should go search for her. But where to find her? At her sister’s? But it would be stupid to go there with such an inquiry. Well, then, let her go! If she wants to torment us, let her torment herself too. That is the very thing she would like me to do. And next time she will be even worse! “But suppose she is not at her sister’s, but has done something else—has even already killed herself ? “Eleven o’clock . . . twelve o’clock. I will not go to the bedroom—it would be stupid to lie down there and wait alone, but I will lie down where I am. I try to occupy myself with some work, to write letters, to read, but I can’t do anything. I sit alone in my study, I torment myself with worries, I am full of anger. I listen. Three o’clock . . . four—no sign of her. I fall asleep just before dawn. When I wake up, there is still no sign of her."
"— Да, простите, — повторил он то же слово, которым заключил и весь рассказ.","“Yes, sorry,” he repeated the same word with which he concluded the whole story.","‘Yes, prostite, forgive me…’ he said, repeating the word with which he had brought his story to an end.","“Yes, good-bye . . . forgive me,” he said, repeating the very words with which he had closed his story."
"На станции этой господин с дамой перешли в другой вагон, о чем они переговаривались еще раньше с кондуктором. Приказчик устроился на лавочке и заснул.
