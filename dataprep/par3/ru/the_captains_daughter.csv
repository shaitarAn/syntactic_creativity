"— А Марья Ивановна? — спросил я: — так же ли смела, как и вы?","— And Marya Ivanovna? I asked: ""Are you as brave as you are?""",“And Maria Ivanovna?” I asked Vasilisa Yegorovna. “Is she as brave as you are?”,“And Marya Ivanovna? Is she as brave as you are?” I asked.
"Признаюсь, я перепугался за бедного моего дядьку. Он хотел, было, пуститься опять в объяснения, но Пугачев его прервал: «Как ты смел лезть ко мне с такими пустяками? — вскричал он, выхватя бумагу из рук секретаря и бросив ее в лицо Савельичу. — Глупый старик! Их обобрали: экая беда? Да ты должен, старый хрыч, вечно бога молить за меня да за моих ребят, за то, что ты и с барином-то своим не висите здесь вместе с моими ослушниками… Зайчий тулуп! Я-те дам зайчий тулуп! Да знаешь ли ты, что я с тебя живого кожу велю содрать на тулупы?»","I confess I was frightened for my poor uncle. He was about to launch into explanations again, but Pugachev interrupted him: “How dare you meddle with me with such trifles? he cried, snatching the paper from the hands of the secretary and throwing it in Savelich's face. ""Stupid old man!"" They were robbed: what's the trouble? Yes, you must, old bastard, forever pray to God for me and for my guys, for the fact that you and your master don’t hang here with my disobedient ... Rabbit coat! I'll give you a rabbit coat! But do you know that I will order you to be skinned alive on sheepskin coats?","At this point I began to fear for my poor Savelich’s life. He was about to embark on further explanations when Pugachov cut him short. “How dare you?” he shouted. “How dare you pester me with such nonsense?” He snatched the paper out of his secretary’s hands and threw it in Savelich’s face. “You stupid old fool! So you’ve been robbed—what a misfortune! Why, you old grumbler, you should be praying for me and my lads for the whole of eternity. You should be grateful that you and your master aren’t swinging too—next to the others who defied me. A hare-skin coat! I’ll give you a hare-skin coat. Yes, I’ll flay the hide off your living body and have that made into a coat!”","I confess I was alarmed for Savelyich. He was about to give more explanations, but Pugachov interrupted him. “How dare you trouble me with such trifles!” he cried, seizing the paper from the secretary’s hands and throwing it in Savelyich’s face. “Stupid old man! They have been robbed—as though it mattered! Why, you old dodderer, you ought to pray for the rest of your life for me and my men, and thank your stars that you and your master are not swinging here together with those who rebelled against me…. Hareskin jacket, indeed! I’ll give you a hareskin jacket! Why, I’ll have you flayed alive and make a jacket of your skin!”"
"Что прикажете? День я кончил так же беспутно, как и начал. Мы отужинали у Аринушки. Зурин поминутно мне подливал, повторяя, что надобно к службе привыкать. Встав изо стола, я чуть держался на ногах; в полночь Зурин отвез меня в трактир. Савельич встретил нас на крыльце. Он ахнул, увидя несомненные признаки моего усердия к службе. «Что это, сударь, с тобою сделалось?» — сказал он жалким голосом, «где ты это нагрузился? Ахти господи! отроду такого греха не бывало!» — Молчи, хрыч! — отвечал я ему, запинаясь; — ты верно пьян, пошел спать… и уложи меня.","What do you order? I ended the day as dissolutely as I started. We dined at Arinushka's. Zurin poured me every minute, repeating that it was necessary to get used to the service. Rising from the table, I could barely stand on my feet; at midnight Zurin took me to a tavern. Savelich met us on the porch. He gasped when he saw the unmistakable signs of my zeal for the service. ""What, sir, has become of you?"" he said in a pitiful voice, “where did you load it? Oh my god! there has never been such a sin!” - Shut up, bastard! I answered him, stammering; - you're sure drunk, go to bed ... and put me to bed.","What was I to do? I finished the day as waywardly as I began it. We dined at Arinushka’s. Zurin kept topping up my glass, repeating that I must get used to army life. When I got up from table, I could hardly stand; it was midnight when Zurin drove me back to the inn. Savelich met us on the porch. He groaned, seeing the unmistakable evidence of my new enthusiasm for army life. “ What’s happened to you, sir?” he asked miserably. “Where on earth have you been, to get yourself so soused? Heavens above! Never before have I seen you like this.” “Shut up, you old grumbler!” I replied stumblingly. “You must be drunk. Go to bed . . . and help me undress.”","What can I say? I finished the day as recklessly as I had begun it. We had supper at Arinushka’s. Zurin kept filling my glass and repeating that I ought to get used to army ways. I could hardly stand when we got up from the table; at midnight Zurin drove me back to the inn. Savelyich met us on the steps. He cried out when he saw the unmistakable signs of my zeal for the Service. “What has come over you, sir?” he said in a shaking voice, “wherever did you get yourself into such a state? Good Lord! Such a dreadful thing has never happened to you before!” “Be quiet, you old dodderer!” I mumbled. “You must be drunk; go and lie down … and put me to bed.”"
"— Как ты это находишь? — спросил я Швабрина, ожидая похвалы, как дани, мне непременно следуемой. Но к великой моей досаде, Швабрин, обыкновенно снисходительный, решительно объявил, что песня моя нехороша.","— How do you find it? I asked Shvabrin, expecting praise, like a tribute, which I would certainly follow. But to my great annoyance, Shvabrin, usually condescending, decisively announced that my song was not good.","“What do you think?” I asked, expecting praise as my rightful due. But Shvabrin, usually an indulgent critic, firmly declared that my song was no good.","“What do you think of it?” I asked Shvabrin, expecting praise as my rightful due. But to my extreme annoyance Shvabrin, who was usually a kind critic, declared that my song was bad."
"Вышла разладица. Петр Андреич, было, и рассердился; но потом рассудил, что всяк волен петь, что кому угодно. Тем и дело кончилось».","Disorder came out. Pyotr Andreevich, it was, and got angry; but then he reasoned that everyone is free to sing whatever they want. That's how it ended.""","We had a difference of opinion. Pyotr Andreich got very angry, but then he realized that everyone is free to sing what he likes. And that was the end of it.”","“There was discord. Pyotr Andreyich was angry at first, but then he thought better of it, and decided that everyone may sing what he likes. And that was the end of it.”"

"«Что, ваше благородие?» — сказал он мне. — «Струсил ты, признайся, когда молодцы мои накинули тебе веревку на шею? Я чаю, небо с овчинку показалось… А покачался бы на перекладине, если бы не твой слуга. Я тотчас узнал старого хрыча. Ну, думал ли ты, ваше благородие, что человек, который вывел тебя к умету, был сам великий государь? (Тут он взял на себя вид важный и таинственный). Ты крепко передо мною виноват» — продолжал он, — «но я помиловал тебя за твою добродетель, за то, что ты оказал мне услугу, когда принужден я был скрываться от своих недругов. То ли еще увидишь! Так ли еще тебя пожалую, когда получу свое государство! Обещаешься ли служить мне с усердием?»","""What, your honor?"" he said to me. “Are you afraid, admit it, when my fellows threw a rope around your neck? I have tea, the sky seemed like a sheepskin ... And I would have swayed on the crossbar if it were not for your servant. I immediately recognized the old bastard. Well, did you think, your honor, that the person who led you to the umet was the great sovereign himself? (Here he assumed an important and mysterious air.) You are deeply guilty before me,” he continued, “but I pardoned you for your virtue, because you did me a favor when I was forced to hide from my enemies. Will you see it again! Will I still take pity on you when I get my state! Do you promise to serve me diligently?”","“Well, your Honor,” he began. “My lads gave you a fright, didn’t they, when they flung a rope round your neck? You must have been fair scared out of your wits. And I’ll vow you’d be swinging now if it weren’t for that servant of yours. I recognized the old grumbler straight away. Well, your Honor, did you ever imagine that the man who guided you to a wayside inn was the very sovereign himself?” With these words he assumed an air of mystery and importance. “You have offended me grievously,” he went on, “but I pardoned you because of your kindness, because you did me a service at a time when I was forced to hide from my foes. But my pardon is nothing—a trifle compared to the honors I shall grant you when I regain my kingdom! Do you vow to serve me with zeal?”","“Well, your honor?” he said to me. “Confess you had a bit of a fright when my lads put your head in the noose? I expect the sky seemed no bigger than a sheepskin to you…. And you would have certainly swung if it had not been for your servant. I knew the old creature at once. Well, did you think, your honor, that the man who brought you to the inn was the great Czar himself?” (He assumed an air of mystery and importance.) “You are very much at fault,” he continued, “but I have spared you for your kindness, for your having done me a service when I had to hide from my enemies. But this is nothing to what you shall see! It’s not to be compared to the favor I’ll show you when I obtain my kingdom! Do you promise to serve me zealously?”"
"«Как изволите видеть. Алексей Иваныч конечно человек умный, и хорошей фамилии, и имеет состояние; но как подумаю, что надобно будет под венцом при всех с ним поцаловаться… Ни за что! ни за какие благополучия!»","“As you wish to see. Aleksei Ivanovich is, of course, an intelligent man, and of a good surname, and has a fortune; but when I think that it will be necessary to kiss him under the crown in front of everyone ... No way! for no welfare!”","“Yes, as you can see. Alexey Ivanich is a clever man, of course, and he’s wealthy and from a good family— but when I think of having to kiss him beneath the bridal crowns, [7] in front of all those people . . .

Of course, Alexey Ivanych is clever and rich, and of good family; but when I think that in church I should have to kiss him before all the people … not for anything! Nothing would induce me!”"
"Я отвечал, что быв однажды уже им помилован, я надеялся не только на его пощаду, но даже и на помощь.","I answered that having once been pardoned by him, I hoped not only for his mercy, but even for help.","I replied that having been spared by him once, I trusted myself not only to his mercy but also to his readiness to help others.","I answered that since he had spared me once, I was hoping he would do so again and would, indeed, help me."

"Я тотчас отправился к Ивану Игнатьичу, и застал его с иголкою в руках: по препоручению комендантши, он нанизывал грибы для сушенья на зиму. «А, Петр Андреич!» — сказал он увидя меня, — «добро пожаловать!

I said to Pugachov: “Listen, I will tell you the whole truth. Think, how can I acknowledge you as Czar? You are an intelligent man; you would see I was pretending.”"
"Мы перебрались через овраг и вступили в слободу. Во всех избах горели огни. Шум и крики раздавались везде. На улице я встретил множество народу; но никто в темноте нас не заметил и не узнал во мне оренбургского офицера. Нас привели прямо к избе, стоявшей на углу перекрестка. У ворот стояло несколько винных бочек и две пушки. «Вот и дворец», — сказал один из мужиков, — «сейчас об вас доложим». Он вошел в избу. Я взглянул на Савельича; старик крестился, читая про себя молитву. Я дожидался долго; наконец мужик воротился и сказал мне: «Ступай: наш батюшка велел впустить офицера».","We crossed the ravine and entered the settlement. Fires were burning in all the huts. Noise and screams were heard everywhere. On the street I met a lot of people; but no one in the darkness noticed us and did not recognize me as an Orenburg officer. We were led straight to the hut, which stood at the corner of the crossroads. Several wine barrels and two cannons stood at the gate. “Here is the palace,” said one of the peasants, “we will report on you now.” He entered the hut. I glanced at Savelich; The old man was baptized, reciting a prayer to himself. I waited a long time; Finally, the peasant came back and said to me: ""Go: our father ordered to let the officer in.""","We made our way over the gully and into the village. There were lights in every hut, and hubbub and shouting from all sides. The lanes were full of people, but it was too dark for anyone to notice us or to recognize me as an officer from Orenburg. We were taken to a hut next to the main crossroads. Beside the gate stood several empty casks and two cannon. “Here’s the palace,” said one of the peasants. “I’ll go in and report.” He went inside. I glanced at Savelich; the old man was crossing himself and quietly repeating a prayer. We waited a long time. In the end the peasant came back and said, “Come along. Our Father has ordered the officer to be brought in.”","We crossed the ravine and entered the village. Lights were burning in all the windows. Noise and shouting came from everywhere.

"Матушка отыскала мой паспорт, хранившийся в ее шкатулке вместе с сорочкою, в которой меня крестили, и вручила его батюшке дрожащею рукою. Батюшка прочел его со вниманием, положил перед собою на стол, и начал свое письмо.","Mother found my passport, which was kept in her casket along with the shirt in which I was baptized, and handed it to the priest with a trembling hand.

"Слова Марьи Ивановны открыли мне глаза и объяснили мне многое. Я понял упорное злоречие, которым Швабрин ее преследовал. Вероятно, замечал он нашу взаимную склонность и старался отвлечь нас друг от друга. Слова, подавшие повод к нашей ссоре, показались мне еще более гнусными, когда, вместо грубой и непристойной насмешки, увидел я в них обдуманную клевету. Желание наказать дерзкого злоязычника сделалось во мне еще сильнее, и я с нетерпением стал ожидать удобного случая.","Marya Ivanovna's words opened my eyes and explained a lot to me. I understood the stubborn slander with which Shvabrin persecuted her. He probably noticed our mutual inclination and tried to distract us from each other.

The desire to punish the insolent evil-tonguer became even stronger in me, and I began to look forward to an opportunity.",Maria Ivanovna’s words explained a great deal. I could see now what lay behind Shvabrin’s relentless jibes; he must have noticed our mutual attraction and been trying to turn us against each other. The words that had led to our quarrel seemed all the viler now that I understood them not as coarse jests but as deliberate slander. I wanted more than ever to punish Shvabrin for his evil tongue; I could hardly wait for an opportunity.,"Marya Ivanovna’s words opened my eyes and explained a great deal to me. I understood the persistent slanders with which he pursued her. The words that gave rise to our quarrel seemed to me all the more vile when, instead of coarse and unseemly mockery, I saw in them deliberate calumny. My desire to punish the impudent slanderer grew more intense, and I waited impatiently for an opportunity."
"Башкирец с трудом шагнул через порог (он был в колодке) и, сняв высокую свою шапку, остановился у дверей. Я взглянул на него и содрогнулся. Никогда не забуду этого человека. Ему казалось лет за семьдесят. У него не было ни носа, ни ушей. Голова его была выбрита; вместо бороды торчало несколько седых волос; он был малого росту, тощ и сгорблен; но узенькие глаза его сверкали еще огнем. — «Эхе!» — сказал комендант, узнав, по страшным его приметам, одного из бунтовщиков, наказанных в 1741 году. — «Да ты видно старый волк, побывал в наших капканах. Ты знать не впервой уже бунтуешь, коли у тебя так гладко выстрогана башка.

You know, it’s not the first time you’ve rebelled, if your head is so smoothly cut.

I looked at him and shuddered. Never shall I forget that man. He must have been over seventy. He had no nose and no ears. His head was shaven and he had no beard, only a few grey hairs sprouting from his chin. He was short, thin and bent, but fire still gleamed in his narrow eyes. “Aha!” said Ivan Kuzmich, recognizing from these terrible signs that he was one of the rebels who had been punished in 1741.[7] “It seems you’re an old wolf, a wolf who’s been caught in our traps before. Judging from the look of you, it’s not the first time you’ve rebelled.

"Белогорская крепость находилась в сорока верстах от Оренбурга. Дорога шла по крутому берегу Яика. Река еще не замерзала, и ее свинцовые волны грустно чернели в однообразных берегах, покрытых белым снегом. За ними простирались киргизские степи. Я погрузился в размышления, большею частию печальные. Гарнизонная жизнь мало имела для меня привлекательности. Я старался вообразить себе капитана Миронова, моего будущего начальника, и представлял его строгим, сердитым стариком, не знающим ничего, кроме своей службы, и готовым за всякую безделицу сажать меня под арест на хлеб и на воду. Между тем начало смеркаться. Мы ехали довольно скоро. — Далече ли до крепости? — спросил я у своего ямщика. «Недалече» — отвечал он. — «Вон уж видна». — Я глядел во все стороны, ожидая увидеть грозные бастионы, башни и вал; но ничего не видал, кроме деревушки, окруженной бревенчатым забором. С одной стороны стояли три или четыре скирда сена, полузанесенные снегом; с другой скривившаяся мельница, с лубочными крыльями, лениво опущенными. — Где же крепость? — спросил я с удивлением. — «Да вот она», — отвечал ямщик, указывая на деревушку, и с этим словом мы в нее въехали. У ворот увидел я старую чугунную пушку; улицы были тесны и кривы; избы низки и большею частию покрыты соломою. Я велел ехать к коменданту, и через минуту кибитка остановилась перед деревянным домиком, выстроенным на высоком месте, близ деревянной же церкви.","Belogorsk fortress was located forty miles from Orenburg. The road went along the steep bank of the Yaik. The river was not yet frozen, and its leaden waves blackened sadly in the monotonous banks covered with white snow. Behind them stretched the Kirghiz steppes. I sank into reflections, mostly sad. Garrison life had little attraction for me. I tried to imagine Captain Mironov, my future chief, and imagined him as a strict, angry old man who knew nothing but his service and was ready to put me under arrest on bread and water for every trifle. Meanwhile, it began to get dark. We drove pretty fast. — Is it far from the fortress? I asked my driver. ""Not far,"" he replied. - ""It's already visible."" - I looked in all directions, expecting to see formidable bastions, towers and a rampart; but he saw nothing but a village surrounded by a log fence. On one side were three or four stacks of hay, half covered with snow; on the other, a crooked windmill, with popular print wings lazily lowered. - Where is the fortress? I asked in surprise. “Yes, here she is,” answered the driver, pointing to the village, and with this word we drove into it. At the gate I saw an old cast-iron cannon; the streets were cramped and crooked; the huts are low and mostly covered with straw. I ordered to go to the commandant, and a minute later the wagon stopped in front of a wooden house built on a high place, near the wooden church.","FORT BELOGORSK lay about twenty-five miles from Orenburg. The road ran along the steep bank of the Yaik. The river had not yet frozen over and, between monotonous banks covered in white snow, its leaden waters looked black and dismal. Beyond the river stretched the Kirghiz steppe. I was sunk deep in my thoughts, which were for the main part gloomy. Garrison life held few attractions for me. I tried to picture Captain Mironov, the fortress commandant, and the image that came to mind was of a stern, short-tempered old man, blind to everything beyond his army duties and ready to arrest me and put me on a diet of bread and water for the most trifling offence. Meanwhile, it was growing dark. We were going quite fast. “Is it much further to the fortress?” I asked my driver. “No,” he replied. “Look—there it is!” I looked all around, expecting to see menacing bastions, towers and a rampart—but there was only a small village encircled by a log palisade. On one side stood three or four hayricks, half buried under snow; on the other—a crooked windmill, its bast sails sagging idly. “But where’s the fortress?” I asked in surprise. “Here!” said the driver, pointing in front of him as we entered the village. By the gate I saw an ancient cast-iron cannon; the lanes were narrow and crooked; the houses were squat, most of them thatched.[3] I asked to be taken to the commandant, and a moment later our sleigh drew up before a small wooden house built on some high ground beside a wooden church.","THE BELOGORSKY FORTRESS was twenty-five miles from Orenburg.

I tried to picture Captain Mironov, my future chief, and thought of him as a stern, bad-tempered old man who cared for nothing but discipline and was ready to put me under arrest on a diet of bread and water for the least little trifle. Meanwhile it was growing dark. We were driving rather fast. “Is it far to the fortress?” I asked the driver. “No, not far,” he answered; “it’s over there, you can see it.” I looked from side to side, expecting to see menacing battlements, towers, and a rampart, but saw nothing except a village surrounded by a log fence. On one side of it stood three or four haystacks, half covered with snow, on another a tumbledown windmill with wings of bark that hung idle. “But where is the fortress?” I asked in surprise. “Why here,” answered the driver, pointing to the village, and as he spoke we drove into it. At the gate I saw an old cannon made of cast iron; the streets were narrow and crooked, the cottages low and, for the most part, with thatched roofs. I told the driver to take me to the Commandant’s, and in another minute the chaise stopped before a wooden house built upon rising ground close to a church, also made of wood."

"Пытка, в старину, так была укоренена в обычаях судопроизводства, что благодетельный указ, уничтоживший оную, долго оставался безо всякого действия. Думали, что собственное признание преступника необходимо было для его полного обличения, — мысль не только неосновательная, но даже и совершенно противная здравому юридическому смыслу: ибо, если отрицание подсудимого не приемлется в доказательство его невинности, то признание его и того менее должно быть доказательством его виновности. Даже и ныне случается мне слышать старых судей, жалеющих об уничтожении варварского обычая. В наше же время никто не сумневался в необходимости пытки, ни судьи, ни подсудимые. Итак приказание коменданта никого из нас не удивило и не встревожило. Иван Игнатьич отправился за башкирцем, который сидел в анбаре под ключом у комендантши, и через несколько минут невольника привели в переднюю. Комендант велел его к себе представить.","Torture, in the old days, was so rooted in the customs of legal proceedings that the beneficent decree that destroyed it remained for a long time without any effect. It was thought that the criminal's own confession was necessary for his complete denunciation - an idea not only unfounded, but even completely contrary to common legal sense: for if the defendant's denial is not acceptable as proof of his innocence, then his confession should still be proof of his innocence. guilt. Even now I sometimes hear old judges lamenting the destruction of the barbarian custom. In our time, no one doubted the need for torture, neither judges nor defendants. So the commandant's order did not surprise or alarm any of us. Ivan Ignatich went for the Bashkir, who was sitting in the hut under the commandant's key, and a few minutes later the slave was brought into the hall. The commandant ordered him to be introduced to him.","In the old days, torture was so firmly rooted in our judicial system that the noble edict decreeing its abolition remained unenforced for a long time.[6] It was believed that a defendant’s guilt could be fully established only if he confessed to the crime—an idea that is not only senseless but contrary to sound legal thinking: if a denial is not accepted as proof of innocence, then why should a confession be accepted as proof of guilt? Even today I sometimes hear old judges complaining about the abolition of this barbarous custom. And in the days of my youth, there was no one at all, neither judge nor defendant, who doubted the necessity of torture. The commandant’s order did not in any way surprise or alarm us. Ivan Ignatich went to fetch the Bashkir, whom Vasilisa Yegorovna had locked up in the barn. Two old soldiers escorted him to the anteroom. The commandant ordered him to be brought before us.","In the old days torture formed so integral a part of judicial procedure that the beneficent law which abolished it long remained a dead letter. It used to be thought that the criminal’s own confession was necessary for convicting him, which is both groundless and wholly opposed to judicial good sense; for if the accused person’s denial of the charge is not considered a proof of his innocence, there is still less reason to regard his confession a proof of his guilt. Even now I sometimes hear old judges regretting the abolition of the barbarous custom. But in those days no one doubted the necessity of torture—neither the judges nor the accused. And so the Commandant’s order did not surprise or alarm us. Ivan Ignatyich went to fetch the Bashkir, who was locked up in Vasilisa Yegorovna’s storehouse, and a few minutes later the prisoner was led into the entry. The Commandant gave word for him to be brought into the room."

"Но Пугачев не был пойман. Он явился на Сибирских заводах, собрал там новые шайки и опять начал злодействовать. Слух о его успехах снова распространился. Мы узнали о разорении Сибирских крепостей. Вскоре весть о взятии Казани и о походе самозванца на Москву встревожила начальников войск, беспечно дремавших в надежде на бессилие презренного бунтовщика. Зурин получил повеление переправиться через Волгу.[9]","But Pugachev was not caught. He appeared at the Siberian factories, gathered new gangs there, and again began to act evil.

"Вскоре все заговорили о Пугачеве. Толки были различны. Комендант послал урядника с поручением разведать хорошенько обо всем по соседним селениям и крепостям.

"Я спешил в дом священника увидеться с Марьей Ивановной. Попадья встретила меня с печальным известием. Ночью у Марьи Ивановны открылась сильная горячка. Она лежала без памяти и в бреду. Попадья ввела меня в ее комнату. Я тихо подошел к ее кровати. Перемена в ее лице поразила меня. Больная меня не узнала. Долго стоял я перед нею, не слушая ни отца Герасима, ни доброй жены его, которые, кажется, меня утешали. Мрачные мысли волновали меня. Состояние бедной, беззащитной сироты, оставленной посреди злобных мятежников, собственное мое бессилие устрашали меня. Швабрин, Швабрин пуще всего терзал мое воображение. Облеченный властию от самозванца, предводительствуя в крепости, где оставалась несчастная девушка — невинный предмет его ненависти, он мог решиться на все. Что мне было делать? Как подать ей помощь? Как освободить из рук злодея? Оставалось одно средство: я решился тот же час отправиться в Оренбург, дабы торопить освобождение Белогорской крепости, и по возможности тому содействовать. Я простился с священником и с Акулиной Памфиловной, с жаром поручая ей ту, которую почитал уже своею женою. Я взял руку бедной девушки и поцаловал ее, орошая слезами. «Прощайте» — говорила мне попадья, провожая меня; — «прощайте, Петр Андреич. Авось увидимся в лучшее время. Не забывайте нас и пишите к нам почаще. Бедная Марья Ивановна, кроме вас, не имеет теперь ни утешения, ни покровителя».","I hurried to the priest's house to see Marya Ivanovna. Popadya greeted me with sad news. During the night Marya Ivanovna developed a violent fever. She lay unconscious and delirious. Popadya led me into her room. I quietly walked over to her bed. The change in her face startled me. The patient did not recognize me. For a long time I stood in front of her, not listening to either Father Gerasim or his good wife, who, it seems, comforted me. Dark thoughts troubled me. The condition of a poor, defenseless orphan, left in the midst of vicious rebels, my own impotence terrified me. Shvabrin, Shvabrin tormented my imagination more than anything. Clothed with power from an impostor, leading in the fortress, where the unfortunate girl remained - the innocent object of his hatred, he could decide on anything. What was I to do? How can I help her? How to free from the hands of the villain? There was only one way left: I decided to go to Orenburg at the same time in order to hasten the liberation of the Belogorsk fortress, and, if possible, to contribute to this. I said goodbye to the priest and to Akulina Pamfilovna, warmly entrusting to her the one whom I had already revered as my wife. I took the hand of the poor girl and kissed it, watering it with tears. “Farewell,” the priest said to me, seeing me off; “Goodbye, Pyotr Andreevich. See you at the best time. Don't forget us and write to us often. Poor Marya Ivanovna, besides you, now has neither consolation nor a patron.","I hurried to Father Gerasim’s to have a talk with Maria Ivanovna. Akulina Pamfilovna met me with sad news. During the night Maria Ivanovna had developed a high fever; she was delirious. Akulina Pamfilovna led me into her room. I went quietly up to her bed. I was shocked at the change in her face. She did not recognize me. I stood there for a long time, paying no attention to Father Gerasim and his kind wife, who were, I think, trying to comfort me. I was troubled by somber thoughts. The plight of the poor orphan, alone and defenseless among angry rebels, filled me with horror; I was no less appalled by my own inability to help. Above all, I was tormented by the thought of Shvabrin. Put in charge of the fortress, invested with power by the impostor, Shvabrin might do anything to the innocent object of his hatred. What could I do? How could I help , how could I rescue her? There was only one possible course of action: I must go to Orenburg at once and do all I could to expedite the liberation of Belogorsk—and, if possible, play a part in this myself. I took my leave of Father Gerasim and Akulina Pamfilovna, fervently imploring the latter to take care of the poor girl whom I already looked on as my wife. I took Maria Ivanovna’s hand and kissed it, bathing it with my tears. “Farewell,” said Akulina Pamfilovna as she saw me out. “Farewell, Pyotr Andreich. May we meet again in better times. Don’t forget us. Write often. Poor Maria Ivanovna has no one else now—you’re the only comfort or protector she has.”","I hastened to the priest’s house to see Marya Ivanovna. The priest’s wife had bad news for me. In the night Marya Ivanovna had developed a fever. She lay unconscious and delirious. Akulina Pamfilovna took me into her room. I walked quietly to the bedside. The change in her face struck me. She did not know me. I stood beside her for some time without listening to Father Gerasim and his kind wife, who were, I think, trying to comfort me. Gloomy thoughts tormented me. The condition of the poor defenseless orphan left among the vindictive rebels, and my own helplessness, terrified me. The thought of Shvabrin tortured my imagination more than anything. Given power by the Pretender, put in charge of the fortress where the unhappy girl—the innocent object of his hatred—remained, he might do anything. What was I to do? How could I help her? How could I free her from the villain’s hands? There was only one thing left me: I decided to go to Orenburg that very hour and do my utmost to hasten the relief of the Belogorsky fortress. I said good-bye to the priest and to Akulina Pamfilovna, begging them to take care of Marya Ivanovna, whom I already regarded as my wife. I took the poor girl’s hand and kissed it, wetting it with my tears. “Good-bye,” said the priest’s wife, taking leave of me, “good-bye, Pyotr Andreyich. I hope we shall meet in better times. Don’t forget us and write to us often. Poor Marya Ivanovna has now no one to comfort and defend her but you.”"

"Снарядить-то ее некому,","There is no one to equip her,","No one to dress her In a wedding gown,","She has no one to see her off,"
"В эту ночь я не спал и не раздевался. Я намерен был отправиться на заре к крепостным воротам, откуда Марья Ивановна должна была выехать, и там проститься с нею в последний раз. Я чувствовал в себе великую перемену: волнение души моей было мне гораздо менее тягостно, нежели то уныние, в котором еще недавно был я погружен. С грустию разлуки сливались во мне и неясные, но сладостные надежды, и нетерпеливое ожидание опасностей, и чувства благородного честолюбия. Ночь прошла незаметно. Я хотел уже выдти из дому, как дверь моя отворилась, и ко мне явился капрал с донесением, что наши казаки ночью выступили из крепости, взяв насильно с собою Юлая, и что около крепости разъезжают неведомые люди. Мысль, что Марья Ивановна не успеет выехать, ужаснула меня; я поспешно дал капралу несколько наставлений, и тотчас бросился к коменданту.","That night I did not sleep and did not undress. I intended to go at dawn to the fortress gates, from where Marya Ivanovna was to leave, and there to say goodbye to her for the last time. I felt a great change in myself: the excitement of my soul was much less painful for me than the despondency in which I had recently been immersed. With the sadness of parting, vague but sweet hopes, and impatient expectation of dangers, and feelings of noble ambition merged in me. The night passed unnoticed. I was about to leave the house, when my door opened, and a corporal came to me with a report that our Cossacks left the fortress at night, forcibly taking Yulai with them, and that unknown people were driving around the fortress. The thought that Marya Ivanovna would not have time to leave horrified me; I hurriedly gave the corporal some instructions, and immediately rushed to the commandant.","THAT NIGHT I did not sleep; I did not even undress. I intended to go at dawn to the gate through which Maria Ivanovna would be leaving the fortress, so I could say goodbye to her for the last time. I could feel a deep change within me; my present agitation was a great deal easier to bear than my recent depression. The sorrow of parting was fused with unclear but sweet hopes, with a sense of noble ambition and an impatient anticipation of danger. The night slipped by. I was about to go out when the door opened and a corporal came in to report that our Cossacks had deserted during the night, forcing Yulay to go with them, and that there were unknown men riding about nearby. I was appalled by the thought that Maria Ivanovna might not be able to leave in time; I hurriedly gave the corporal his orders and rushed off to the commandant.","I DID not undress or sleep that night. I intended to go at dawn to the fortress gate from which Marya Ivanovna was to start on her journey, and there to say good-bye to her for the last time. I was conscious of a great change in myself; the agitation of my mind was much less oppressive than the gloom in which I had but recently been plunged. The grief of parting was mingled with vague but delicious hope, with eager expectation of danger and a feeling of noble ambition. The night passed imperceptibly. I was on the point of going out when my door opened and the corporal came to tell me that our Cossacks had left the fortress in the night, taking Yulay with them by force, and that strange men were riding about outside the fortress. The thought that Marya Ivanovna might not have time to leave terrified me; I hastily gave a few instructions to the corporal and rushed off to the Commandant’s."
"— Послушай, мужичок, — сказал я ему — знаешь ли ты эту сторону? Возьмешься ли ты довести меня до ночлега?","“Listen, little man,” I said to him, “do you know this side? Will you take me to bed for the night?","“Listen, good sir,” I said. “Do you know these parts? Can you guide me to somewhere I can shelter for the night?”","“I say, my good fellow, do you know these parts?” I asked him. “Could you guide us to a night’s lodging?”"
— Изрядно сказано! пускай его потужит…,- Pretty well said! let him push it...,"“Well said, well said—let a young man toil and sorrow! ..........................................",A splendid thing to say! He’ll have much sorrow …
"Все были поражены. «Ну» — сказал комендант, — «видно нам от него толку не добиться. Юлай, отведи башкирца в анбар. А мы, господа, кой о чем еще потолкуем».","Everyone was amazed. ""Well,"" said the commandant, ""we can't seem to get any sense out of him. Yulai, take the Bashkir to the barn. And we, gentlemen, will talk about something else.”","We were all shocked. “Well,” said Ivan Kuzmich, “this fellow certainly won’t be telling us anything much. Yulay, take him back to the barn. Gentlemen, we have a few things to talk about.”","It was a shock to all of us. “Well,” said the Commandant, “we evidently cannot learn much from him. Yulay, take the Bashkir back to the storehouse. We have a few more things to talk over, gentlemen.”"
"«Ба, ба, ба, ба!» — сказал старик. — «Теперь понимаю: ты, видно, в Марью Ивановну влюблен. О, дело другое! Бедный малый! Но все же я никак не могу дать тебе роту солдат и полсотни казаков. Эта экспедиция была бы неблагоразумна; я не могу взять ее на свою ответственность».","""Ba, ba, ba, ba!"" said the old man. - “Now I understand: you, apparently, are in love with Marya Ivanovna. Oh, it's different! Poor little one! But still I can't give you a company of soldiers and fifty Cossacks. This expedition would be imprudent; I can't take her on my own.""","“Ah!” said the old man, “now I see! You’re in love with Maria Ivanovna. Well, that’s another story altogether! My poor boy! But all the same, I still cannot give you a company of soldiers and fifty Cossacks. Such an expedition would be imprudent. I cannot assume such a responsibility.”","“Oh, I see!” said the old man, “now I understand…. You are evidently in love with Marya Ivanovna. Oh, that’s another matter! Poor boy! But all the same, I cannot possibly give you a detachment of soldiers and fifty Cossacks. Such an expedition would be unreasonable; I cannot take the responsibility for it.”"
"— Согласятся, верно согласятся, — отвечал я, — когда узнают Марью Ивановну. Я надеюсь и на тебя. Батюшка и матушка тебе верят: ты будешь за нас ходатаем, не так ли?","“They will agree, they will surely agree,” I answered, “when they recognize Marya Ivanovna.” I hope for you too. Father and mother believe you: you will intercede for us, won't you?","“They will give their consent,” I said. “Once they know Maria Ivanovna, they’re sure to give their consent. And I’m counting on you too. Father and Mother trust you. You will intercede on our behalf, won’t you?”","“They will agree; I am sure they will agree when they know Marya Ivanovna,” I answered. “I rely on you, too. My father and mother trust you; you will intercede for us, won’t you?”"
"«Ты мне этого не сказал» — заметил Пугачев, у коего лицо омрачилось.","“You didn’t tell me that,” remarked Pugachev, whose face darkened.","“This is something you kept from me,” said Pugachov, and his face darkened.","“You hadn’t told me,” remarked Pugachov, and his face clouded."
"Старичок в глазетовом кафтане поспешно допил третью свою чашку, значительно разбавленную ромом, и отвечал генералу: «Я думаю, ваше превосходительство, что не должно действовать ни наступательно, ни оборонительно».","The old man in an eyelet caftan hurriedly finished his third cup, significantly diluted with rum, and answered the general: “I think, Your Excellency, that one should not act either offensively or defensively.”","The little old man in the brocade robe quickly downed his third cup of tea, diluted with a considerable quantity of rum, and said, “My own view, your Honor, is that we should take neither the offensive nor the defensive.”","The little old man in the brocade coat hastily finished his third cup of tea, considerably diluted with rum, and said in answer to the General: “I think, your Excellency, we need not take either the offensive or the defensive.”"

"Подходя к комендантскому дому, мы увидели на площадке человек двадцать стареньких инвалидов с длинными косами и в треугольных шляпах. Они выстроены были во фрунт. Впереди стоял комендант, старик бодрый и высокого росту, в колпаке и в китайчатом халате. Увидя нас, он к нам подошел, сказал мне несколько ласковых слов и стал опять командовать. Мы остановились, было, смотреть на учение; но он просил нас идти к Василисе Егоровне, обещаясь быть вслед за нами. «А здесь» — прибавил он — «нечего вам смотреть».","Approaching the commandant's house, we saw about twenty old invalids with long braids and three-cornered hats on the landing. They were lined up in front. In front stood the commandant, a vigorous and tall old man, in a cap and in a Chinese dressing gown. Seeing us, he approached us, said a few kind words to me, and again began to command. We stopped, it was, to look at the doctrine; but he asked us to go to Vasilisa Yegorovna, promising to follow us. “But here,” he added, “there is nothing for you to see.”","As we approached the commandant’s house, we saw about twenty old soldiers standing to attention on a small square; they had their hair in long pigtails and were wearing three-cornered hats.[6] The commandant, a tall vigorous-looking old man in a nightcap and a cotton dressing gown, stood facing them. Seeing us, he came over, said a few words of welcome to me, and returned to drilling his men. We would have stopped to watch, but he asked us to go on in, promising to join us soon. “There’s nothing to see here,” he added.","As we approached the Commandant’s house we saw in the square some twenty old garrison soldiers in three-cornered hats and with long queues.

"Бопре в отечестве своем был парикмахером, потом в Пруссии солдатом, потом приехал в Россию pour Etre outchitel, не очень понимая значения этого слова. Он был добрый малый, но ветрен и беспутен до крайности. Главною его слабостию была страсть к прекрасному полу; не редко за свои нежности получал он толчки, от которых охал по целым суткам. К тому же не был он (по его выражению) и врагом бутылки, т. е. (говоря по-русски) любил хлебнуть лишнее. Но как вино подавалось у нас только за обедом, и то по рюмочке, причем учителя обыкновенно и обносили, то мой Бопре очень скоро привык к русской настойке, и даже стал предпочитать ее винам своего отечества, как не в пример более полезную для желудка. Мы тотчас поладили, и хотя по контракту обязан он был учить меня по-французски, по-немецки и всем наукам, но он предпочел наскоро выучиться от меня кое-как болтать по-русски, — и потом каждый из нас занимался уже своим делом. Мы жили душа в душу. Другого ментора я и не желал. Но вскоре судьба нас разлучила, и вот по какому случаю:","Beaupré was a hairdresser in his own country, then a soldier in Prussia, then came to Russia pour Etre outchitel, not really understanding the meaning of this word. He was a kind fellow, but windy and dissolute to the extreme. His main weakness was a passion for the fair sex; not infrequently for his tenderness he received shocks, from which he groaned for whole days. Moreover, he was not (as he put it) an enemy of the bottle, i.e. (speaking in Russian) he liked to sip too much. But as wine was served with us only at dinner, and then by a glass, and the teachers usually carried it around, then my Beaupré very soon got used to the Russian tincture, and even began to prefer it to the wines of his fatherland, as unlike more useful for the stomach. We immediately got along well, and although under the contract he was obliged to teach me in French, German and all sciences, he preferred to quickly learn from me how to chat in Russian, and then each of us went about his own business. We lived soul to soul. I didn't want another mentor. But soon fate separated us, and here's the occasion:","In his fatherland Beaupré had been a barber; he had been a soldier in Prussia and then come to Russia “pour être a teacher”—although his understanding of what this entailed was somewhat vague. He was good-natured, but flighty and extremely wayward. His chief weakness was a passion for the fair sex; all too often, however, his tender advances were parried by blows that set him moaning and groaning for days on end. He was also—as he used to put it—“no enemy of the bottle,” that is, in plain language, he liked to drink too much. But since in our house wine was served only at dinner, and since each person was given only one small glass and the tutor in any case was usually passed over, my Beaupré soon got used to vodka cordials and even came to prefer them to the wines of his fatherland, pronouncing them incomparably better for the digestion. He and I hit it off immediately and, although his contract stipulated that he was to teach me French, German, and every one of the sciences, [5] he chose instead to learn enough Russian from me to get by and then leave me to my own devices. We pursued our separate interests and lived in perfect harmony. I certainly wished for no other mentor. But Fate soon separated us, as I will now relate.","In his native land Beaupré had been a hairdresser; afterward he was a soldier in Prussia, and then came to Russia pour être outchitel,* without clearly understanding the meaning of that word. He was a good fellow, but extremely thoughtless and flighty. His chief weakness was his passion for the fair sex; his attentions were often rewarded by blows, which made him groan for hours. Besides, “he was not an enemy of the bottle,” as he put it; that is, he liked to take a drop too much. But since wine was only served in our house at dinner, and then only one glass to each person, and the tutor was generally passed over, my Beaupré soon grew accustomed to the Russian homemade brandy and, indeed, came to prefer it to the wines of his own country as being far better for the digestion. We made friends at once, and although he was supposed by the agreement to teach me “French, German, and all subjects,” he preferred to pick up some Russian from me and, after that, we each followed our own pursuits. We got on together capitally. I wished for no other mentor. But fate soon parted us, and this was how it happened."

"Я кое-как стал изъяснять ему должность секунданта, но Иван Игнатьич никак не мог меня понять. «Воля ваша» — сказал он. — «Коли уж мне и вмешаться в это дело, так разве пойти к Ивану Кузмичу да донести ему по долгу службы, что в фортеции умышляется злодействие противное казенному интересу: не благоугодно ли будет господину коменданту принять надлежащие меры…»","I somehow began to explain to him the position of a second, but Ivan Ignatich could not understand me. ""Your choice,"" he said. “If I have to intervene in this matter, is it really possible to go to Ivan Kuzmich and inform him on duty that villainy is planned in the fort that is contrary to public interest: wouldn’t it be pleasing to the commandant to take appropriate measures ...”","As best I could, I explained to him the duties of a second, but Ivan Ignatich simply could not understand me. “Do as you wish,” he said, “but the only part I can play in this business is to go to the commandant as my duty requires, report that a wicked deed, a deed injurious to the interests of the state, is being plotted here, and ask if he wishes to take appropriate measures. ”[6] I took fright and begged Ivan Ignatich not to say anything to Ivan Kuzmich.","I tried to explain to him the duties of a second, but Ivan Ignatyich simply could not understand me. “You may say what you like,” he said, “but if I am to take part in this affair, it is only to go to Ivan Kuzmich and tell him, as duty bids me, that a crime contrary to the interests of the State is being planned in the fortress—and to ask if the Commandant would be pleased to take proper measures.”"

"Итак все мои блестящие надежды рушились! Вместо веселой петербургской жизни ожидала меня скука в стороне глухой и отдаленной. Служба, о которой за минуту думал я с таким восторгом, показалась мне тяжким несчастием. Но спорить было нечего. На другой день по утру подвезена была к крыльцу дорожная кибитка; уложили в нее чамодан, погребец с чайным прибором и узлы с булками и пирогами, последними знаками домашнего баловства. Родители мои благословили меня. Батюшка сказал мне: «Прощай, Петр. Служи верно, кому присягнешь; слушайся начальников; за их лаской не гоняйся; на службу не напрашивайся; от службы не отговаривайся; и помни пословицу: береги платье с нову, а честь с молоду». Матушка в слезах наказывала мне беречь мое здоровье, а Савельичу смотреть за дитятей. Надели на меня зайчий тулуп, а сверху лисью шубу. Я сел в кибитку с Савельичем, и отправился в дорогу, обливаясь слезами.","So all my brilliant hopes collapsed! Instead of a cheerful Petersburg life, boredom awaited me in a deaf and distant side. The service, which for a minute I thought with such enthusiasm, seemed to me a grave misfortune. But there was nothing to argue. The next day, in the morning, a road wagon was brought up to the porch; they put in it a suitcase, a cellar with a tea set, and bundles with rolls and pies, the last signs of home pampering. My parents blessed me. The father said to me: “Goodbye, Peter. Serve faithfully to whom you swear; obey the bosses; do not chase after their affection; do not ask for service; do not excuse yourself from the service; and remember the proverb: take care of the dress from the new, and honor from the youth. Mother, in tears, ordered me to take care of my health, and Savelich to look after the child. They put a rabbit coat on me, and a fox coat on top. I got into the wagon with Savelitch and set off on the road, shedding tears.","All my brilliant hopes were dashed. What awaited me was not the gaiety of Petersburg but the tedium of life in a godforsaken backwater. Army service, which only a moment ago I had been looking forward to with such glee, now seemed a heavy burden. But it was no use protesting. Next morning a hooded sleigh was brought round to the main door. In it were loaded my trunk; a wooden chest [14] with cups, plates and a teapot; and some parcels containing pies and white bread rolls—the last tokens of the pampered life I had enjoyed at home. My parents gave me their blessing. Father said, “Goodbye, Pyotr. Serve faithfully the sovereign to whom you pledge your allegiance; [15] obey your superiors; do not curry favor; do not volunteer for duties; do not shirk duties; and remember the saying, “Take care of your clothes when they are new and your honor when you are young.” Mother tearfully exhorted me to take care of my health—and Savelich to look after “the child.” I was wrapped up warmly: in a fox-fur overcoat over a hare-skin coat. I got in beside Savelich and set off, weeping bitterly.","And so all my brilliant hopes were dashed to the ground! Instead of the gay Petersburg life, boredom in a distant and wild part of the country awaited me. Going into the army, of which I had thought with such delight only a moment before, now seemed to me a dreadful misfortune. But it was no use protesting! Next morning a traveling chaise drove up to the house; my bag, a box with tea things, and bundles of pies and rolls, the last tokens of family affection, were packed into it. My parents blessed me. My father said to me: “Good-bye, Pyotr. Carry out faithfully your oath of allegiance; obey your superiors; don’t seek their favor; don’t put yourself forward, and do not shirk your duty; remember the saying: ‘Watch over your clothes while they are new, and over your honor while you are young.’ ” My mother admonished me with tears to take care of myself, and bade Savelyich look after “the child.” They dressed me in a hareskin jacket and a fox-fur overcoat. I stepped into the chaise with Savelyich and set off on my journey, weeping bitterly."
"— То-то! — сказал я Пугачеву. — Не лучше ли тебе отстать от них самому, заблаговременно, да прибегнуть к милосердию государыни?","- That's it! I said to Pugachev. “Wouldn’t it be better for you to leave them yourself, in advance, and resort to the mercy of the Empress?”","“They will indeed,” I replied. “Shouldn’t you leave them, while there’s still time, and throw yourself on the Empress’s mercy?”",“That’s just it!” I said. “Hadn’t you better leave them yourself in good time and appeal to the Empress’ mercy?”

I’ll pray to God for a century for you, but I won’t even mention the rabbit coat. ”","“Thank you, gracious Sir, thank you, my dear father!” Savelich said as he sat down. “May the Lord grant you a hundred years of good health for pitying and comforting an old man. I shall say prayers for you till the end of my days and never will you hear another word from me about that hare-skin coat.”","“Thank you, sire, thank you, our father!” said Savelyich, climbing up. “May God let you live to be a hundred for your kindness to an old man.

"По моему приказанию гребцы зацепили плот багром, лодка моя толкнулась о плывучую висилицу. Я выпрыгнул и очутился между ужасными столбами. Яркая луна озаряла обезображенные лица несчастных. Один из них был старый чуваш, другой русский крестьянин, сильный и здоровый малый лет 20-ти. Но, взглянув на третьего, я сильно был поражен и не мог удержаться от жалобного восклицания: это был Ванька, бедный мой Ванька, по глупости своей приставший к Пугачеву. Над ними прибита была черная доска, на которой белыми крупными буквами было написано: Воры и бунтовщики. Гребцы смотрели равнодушно и ожидали меня, удерживая плот багром. Я сел опять в лодку.

One of them was an old Chuvash, the other was a Russian peasant, a strong and healthy fellow of about 20 years old. But, glancing at the third, I was greatly amazed and could not help exclaiming plaintively: it was Vanka, my poor Vanka, who, out of his stupidity, had molested Pugachev. Above them was nailed a black board, on which was written in large white letters: Thieves and rebels. The rowers looked indifferent and waited for me, holding the raft with a hook. I got back into the boat. The raft floated down the river. The gallows darkened for a long time. Finally she disappeared - and my boat moored to a high and steep bank ...","I told the boatmen to catch the raft with a boathook, and our boat knocked against the floating gallows. I jumped across and there I stood—between the terrible posts. The moon shone brightly on the wretches’ mutilated faces. One of them was an old Chuvash; [2] the second was a Russian peasant, a strong, healthy-looking lad about twenty years old. But when I looked up at the third, I could not help but cry out in pity and horror: it was Vanya, my poor Vanya, [3] who had gone over to Pugachov in a moment of folly. Nailed to the crossbeam above the men’s heads was a black board on which was written, in large white letters: THIEVES AND REBELS. The boatmen looked on indifferently, holding the raft in place with the boathook as they waited for me. I got back into the boat. The raft floated off again down the river. The gallows remained visible for a long time, blacker than the surrounding darkness. In the end it vanished and our boat reached the tall, steep left bank.","I told the oarsmen to hold the raft with a boat-hook, and my boat knocked against the floating gallows. I jumped out and found myself between the terrible posts. The full moon lighted the disfigured faces of the unfortunate creatures…. One of them was an old Chuvash, another a Russian peasant boy of about twenty, strong and healthy. I was shocked when I looked at the third and could not refrain from crying out: it was our servant Vanka—poor Vanka, who, in his foolishness, went over to Pugachov. A black board was nailed over the gallows and had written on it in white letters: “Thieves and rebels.” The oarsmen waited for me, unconcerned, holding the raft with the hook. I stepped into the boat. The raft floated down the river. The gallows showed black in the dim night long after we passed it. At last it disappeared and my boat landed at the high and steep bank."
"Швабрин переменился в лице. «Это тебе так не пройдет»— сказал он, стиснув мне руку. — «Вы мне дадите сатисфакцию».","Shvabrin's face changed. “It won’t work for you,” he said, squeezing my hand. “You will give me satisfaction.”","Shvabrin paled. “I can’t let that pass,” he said, gripping my arm. “I demand satisfaction.” “Certainly.","Shvabrin changed color. “You’ll have to pay for this,” he said, gripping my arm; “you will give me satisfaction.”"

"— Она невеста моя, — отвечал я Пугачеву, видя благоприятную перемену погоды и не находя нужды скрывать истину.","“She is my bride,” I replied to Pugachev, seeing the favorable change in the weather and finding no need to conceal the truth.","“She is my betrothed,” I answered. His mood had clearly changed for the better and I saw no point in hiding the truth.","I answered, seeing the favorable change in the weather and not thinking it necessary to conceal the truth."
Пословица,Proverb,—POPULAR SAYING,A PROVERB
Как ни слова себе доброго,No matter how good a word to yourself,"Wealth or joy, praise or rank;",No word of praise and no high rank.
Только выслужила головушка,Only the head survived,"All you’ve earned, good head of mine,",All it has won is a gallows high
И что я пленен тобой.,And that I am captivated by you.,In the grip of hopeless passion.,I am captive held by thee.”
"Судьи мои, начинавшие, казалось, выслушивать ответы мои с некоторою благосклонностию, были снова предубеждены противу меня при виде моего смущения. Гвардейский офицер потребовал, чтоб меня поставили на очную ставку с главным доносителем. Генерал велел кликнуть вчерашнего злодея. Я с живостию обратился к дверям, ожидая появления своего обвинителя. Через несколько минут загремели цепи, двери отворились, и вошел — Швабрин. Я изумился его перемене. Он был ужасно худ и бледен. Волоса его, недавно черные как смоль, совершенно поседели, длинная борода была всклокочена. Он повторил обвинения свои слабым, но смелым голосом. По его словам, я отряжен был от Пугачева в Оренбург шпионом; ежедневно выезжал на перестрелки, дабы передавать письменные известия о всем, что делалось в городе; что наконец явно передался самозванцу, разъезжал с ним из крепости в крепость, стараясь всячески губить своих товарищей-изменников, дабы занимать их места и пользоваться наградами, раздаваемыми от самозванца. — Я выслушал его молча и был доволен одним: имя Марьи Ивановны не было произнесено гнусным злодеем, оттого ли, что самолюбие его страдало при мысли о той, которая отвергла его с презрением; оттого ли, что в сердце его таилась искра того же чувства, которое и меня заставляло молчать, — как бы то ни было, имя дочери Белогорского коменданта не было произнесено в присутствии комиссии. Я утвердился еще более в моем намерении, и когда судьи спросили: чем могу опровергнуть показания Швабрина, я отвечал, что держусь первого своего объяснения и ничего другого в оправдание себе сказать не могу. Генерал велел нас вывести. Мы вышли вместе. Я спокойно взглянул на Швабрина, но не сказал ему ни слова. Он усмехнулся злобной усмешкою и, приподняв свои цепи, опередил меня и ускорил свои шаги. Меня опять отвели в тюрьму и с тех пор уже к допросу не требовали.","My judges, who seemed to begin to listen to my answers with some favor, were again prejudiced against me at the sight of my embarrassment. The Guards officer demanded that I be placed at a confrontation with the main informer. The general ordered to call yesterday's villain. I quickly turned to the door, waiting for the appearance of my accuser. A few minutes later the chains rattled, the doors opened, and in came Shvabrin. I was amazed at his change. He was terribly thin and pale. His hair, which had recently been jet-black, had turned completely gray, and his long beard was disheveled. He repeated his accusations in a weak but bold voice. According to him, I was assigned from Pugachev to Orenburg as a spy; daily went to skirmishes in order to convey written news about everything that was happening in the city; that at last he clearly passed on to the impostor, traveled with him from fortress to fortress, trying in every possible way to destroy his fellow traitors in order to take their places and use the rewards handed out from the impostor. - I listened to him in silence and was satisfied with one thing: the name of Marya Ivanovna was not uttered by the vile villain, perhaps because his pride suffered at the thought of the one who rejected him with contempt; Was it because there was a spark of the same feeling in his heart that kept me silent as well? Be that as it may, the name of the daughter of the Belogorsk commandant was not uttered in the presence of the commission. I became even more convinced of my intention, and when the judges asked how I could refute Shvabrin's testimony, I replied that I stuck to my first explanation and could not say anything else to justify myself. The general ordered us to withdraw. We went out together. I glanced calmly at Shvabrin, but did not say a word to him. He grinned an evil smile and, lifting his chains, outstripped me and quickened his steps. I was again taken to prison and since then I have not been required to be interrogated.","My judges, who had, I think, been beginning to listen to me with a modicum of good will, once more took against me. The Guards captain requested that I be confronted with the main informer. The general ordered “yesterday’s villain” to be brought in. I turned quickly towards the door, waiting for my accuser to appear. A few minutes later there was a clanking of chains, the door opened—and in came Shvabrin. I was astonished at how he had changed. He was terribly thin and pale. His hair, not long ago jet-black, was now grey; his long beard was unkempt and matted. He repeated his accusations in a weak but determined voice. He said that Pugachov had sent me to Orenburg as a spy; I had ridden out on daily sorties in order to pass on written reports about conditions in the city; in the end I had joined the impostor openly, accompanying him from one fortress to another and doing my utmost to undermine my fellow renegades, so as to supplant them in their posts and enjoy still more favors from the impostor. I listened to him in silence and was grateful for one thing: he did not pronounce the name of Maria Ivanovna. Maybe the thought of the woman who had scorned him was too wounding to his vanity; maybe there still lingered in the depth of his heart a spark of the same feeling that had impelled me to keep silent myself; in any case, the name of the daughter of the commandant of Fort Belogorsk was not mentioned before the Commission. This confirmed me in my resolve and when the judges asked what I had to say in reply to Shvabrin ’s testimony, I replied that I stood by my previous statement and had nothing to add in my defence. The general ordered us both to be taken away. We left the room together. I looked calmly at Shvabrin but said nothing. He grinned spitefully and, lifting up his chains, quickened his pace and walked out ahead of me. I was led back to my cell and not summoned for any further interrogation.","My judges, who seemed to have been listening to me with favor, were once more prejudiced against me by my confusion. The officer of the Guards asked that I should be faced with the chief informer. The General gave word that yesterday’s villain should be brought in. I turned to the door with interest, waiting for the appearance of my accuser. A few minutes later there was a rattle of chains, the door opened, and Shvabrin walked in. I was surprised at the change in him. He was terribly pale and thin. His hair that had a short time ago been black as pitch was now white; his long beard was unkempt. He repeated his accusations in a weak but confident voice. According to him I had been sent by Pugachov to Orenburg as a spy; under the pretext of sallies, I had come out every day to give him written news of all that was happening in the town; at last I had openly joined the Pretender, had driven with him from fortress to fortress, doing my utmost to ruin my fellow-traitors so as to occupy their posts, and had taken presents from the Pretender. I heard him out in silence and was pleased with one thing only: Marya Ivanovna’s name had not been uttered by the base villain, either because his vanity suffered at the thought of one who had scorned him, or because there lingered in his heart a spark of the same feeling which made me keep silent about her. In any case, the name of the Belogorsky Commandant’s daughter was not mentioned before the Commission. I was more determined than ever not to bring it up, and when the judges asked me how I could disprove Shvabrin’s accusations, I answered that I adhered to my original explanation and had nothing more to say in my defense. The General gave word for us to be led away. We went out together. I calmly looked at Shvabrin, but did not say a word to him. He gave a malignant smile and, lifting his chains, quickened his pace and left me behind. I was taken back to prison and not called for examination anymore."
"Слух о моем аресте поразил все мое семейство. Марья Ивановна так просто рассказала моим родителям о странном знакомстве моем с Пугачевым, что оно не только не беспокоило их, но еще заставляло часто смеяться от чистого сердца. Батюшка не хотел верить, чтобы я мог быть замешан в гнусном бунте, коего цель была ниспровержение престола и истребление дворянского рода. Он строго допросил Савельича. Дядька не утаил, что барин бывал в гостях у Емельки Пугачева, и что-де злодей его таки жаловал; но клялся, что ни о какой измене он и не слыхивал. Старики успокоились и с нетерпением стали ждать благоприятных вестей. Марья Ивановна сильно была встревожена, но молчала, ибо в высшей степени была одарена скромностию и осторожностию.","The news of my arrest shocked my entire family. Marya Ivanovna told my parents so simply about my strange acquaintance with Pugachev that it not only did not disturb them, but also made them often laugh from the bottom of their hearts. Batiushka did not want to believe that I could be involved in a vile rebellion, the purpose of which was the overthrow of the throne and the extermination of the noble family. He severely interrogated Savelich. The uncle did not hide the fact that the master was visiting Emelka Pugachev, and that the villain still complained about something; but he swore that he had never heard of any betrayal. The old people calmed down and began to look forward to favorable news. Marya Ivanovna was greatly alarmed, but kept silent, for she was gifted to the highest degree with modesty and caution.","The news of my arrest shocked my family. Maria Ivanovna had recounted the story of my strange acquaintance with Pugachov so innocently that, far from feeling any concern, my parents had more than once burst into hearty laughter. Father found it inconceivable that I could have been party to a rebellion whose aim was the overthrow of the imperial family and the destruction of the nobility. He cross-questioned Savelich. My old tutor made no secret of the fact that I had indeed been the guest of Yemelka Pugachov and that the villain had treated me generously, but he swore that he had never heard a word of anything treasonable. My parents felt reassured and began to wait impatiently for better news. Maria Ivanovna was most alarmed but, being someone unusually modest and discreet, she said nothing.","The news of my arrest was a shock to my family.

The old man did not conceal the fact that I had been to see Pugachov and that the villain had been kind to me; but he swore that he had not heard of any treason. My parents were reassured and waited impatiently for favorable news. Marya Ivanovna was very much alarmed but said nothing, for she was extremely modest and prudent."

In serving her you will be serving me, because I am determined to marry her as soon as circumstances allow.”"
"Я приехал в Казань, опустошенную и погорелую. По улицам, наместо домов, лежали груды углей и торчали закоптелые стены без крыш и окон. Таков был след, оставленный Пугачевым! Меня привезли в крепость, уцелевшую посереди сгоревшего города. Гусары сдали меня караульному офицеру. Он велел кликнуть кузнеца. Надели мне на ноги цепь и заковали ее наглухо.

"Жители начали присягать. Они подходили один за другим, цалуя распятие и потом кланяясь самозванцу. Гарнизонные солдаты стояли тут же. Ротный портной, вооруженный тупыми своими ножницами, резал у них косы. Они, отряхиваясь, подходили к руке Пугачева, который объявлял им прощение и принимал в свою шайку. Все это продолжалось около трех часов. Наконец Пугачев встал с кресел и сошел с крыльца в сопровождении своих старшин. Ему подвели белого коня, украшенного богатой сбруей. Два казака взяли его под руки и посадили на седло. Он объявил отцу Герасиму, что будет обедать у него. В эту минуту раздался женский крик. Несколько разбойников вытащили на крыльцо Василису Егоровну, растрепанную и раздетую донага. Один из них успел уже нарядиться в ее душегрейку. Другие таскали перины, сундуки, чайную посуду, белье и всю рухлядь. «Батюшки мои!» — кричала бедная старушка. — «Отпустите душу на покаяние. Отцы родные, отведите меня к Ивану Кузмичу». Вдруг она взглянула на виселицу и узнала своего мужа. «Злодеи!» — закричала она в исступлении. — «Что это вы с ним сделали? Свет ты мой, Иван Кузмич, удалая солдатская головушка! не тронули тебя ни штыки прусские, ни пули турецкие; не в честном бою положил ты свой живот, а сгинул от беглого каторжника!» — Унять старую ведьму! — сказал Пугачев. Тут молодой казак ударил ее саблею по голове, и она упала мертвая на ступени крыльца. Пугачев уехал; народ бросился за ним.","The people began to take the oath. They approached one by one, kissing the crucifix and then bowing to the impostor. The garrison soldiers were standing right there. The company tailor, armed with his blunt scissors, cut their braids. Shaking themselves off, they approached Pugachev's hand, who proclaimed forgiveness to them and accepted them into his gang. All this went on for about three hours. Finally Pugachev got up from his chair and stepped down from the porch, accompanied by his foremen. A white horse, adorned with a rich harness, was brought to him. Two Cossacks took him by the arms and put him on the saddle. He announced to Father Gerasim that he would dine with him. At that moment, a woman screamed. Several robbers dragged Vasilisa Yegorovna onto the porch, disheveled and stripped naked. One of them had already dressed up in her shower jacket. Others carried featherbeds, chests, tea utensils, linen and all the junk. ""My fathers!"" cried the poor old woman. “Release your soul to repentance. Fathers, take me to Ivan Kuzmich. Suddenly she looked at the gallows and recognized her husband. ""Villains!"" she screamed in a frenzy. “What did you do to him? You are my light, Ivan Kuzmich, daring soldier's little head! neither Prussian bayonets nor Turkish bullets touched you; not in a fair fight did you lay down your stomach, but perished from a runaway convict! - Get rid of the old witch!

Pugachev left; the people rushed after him.","One by one, the inhabitants of the village swore their allegiance to Pugachov, kissing the crucifix and bowing down before him.

Then Pugachov stood up and came down from the porch, followed by the Cossack elders. A white horse in fine harness was led over to him. Two Cossacks helped him into the saddle. He told Father Gerasim that he would be dining in his house. Just then a woman screamed. The brigands had dragged Vasilisa Yegorovna out onto the porch—wild-haired and naked. One of them had already put on her quilted jerkin. Others were dragging out feather beds, chests, crockery, and all kinds of other household belongings. “Kind sirs,” the poor old woman was shouting, “allow my soul to repent in peace.

Ivan Kuzmich, light of my life, soldier brave and true! Neither Prussian bayonets nor Turkish bullets could harm you—and now, instead of laying down your life in honorable battle, you have been hanged by a runaway convict!” “Silence the old witch!” said Pugachov.

"Я ничего не мог тогда понять из этого воровского разговора, но после уж догадался, что дело шло о делах Яицкого войска, в то время только что усмиренного после бунта 1772 года. Савельич слушал с видом большого неудовольствия. Он посматривал с подозрением то на хозяина, то на вожатого. Постоялый двор, или, по тамошнему, умет, находился в стороне, в степи, далече от всякого селения, и очень походил на разбойническую пристань. Но делать было нечего. Нельзя было и подумать о продолжении пути. Беспокойство Савельича очень меня забавляло. Между тем я расположился ночевать и лег на лавку. Савельич решился убраться на печь; хозяин лег на полу. Скоро вся изба захрапела, и я заснул, как убитый.","At that time I could not understand anything from this thieves' conversation, but afterward I guessed that it was about the affairs of the Yaitsky army, which at that time had just been pacified after the riot of 1772. Savelich listened with an air of great displeasure. He glanced suspiciously first at the owner, then at the counselor. The inn, or, according to the locals, umet, was located aside, in the steppe, far from any village, and very much resembled a robber's wharf. But there was nothing to be done. It was impossible to think about continuing the path. Savelich's uneasiness amused me greatly. In the meantime, I settled down for the night and lay down on a bench. Savelich decided to get out on the stove; the owner lay down on the floor. Soon the whole hut was snoring, and I fell asleep like the dead.","At the time I understood nothing of this thieves’ cant, but I realized later that they had been talking about the Yaik Cossacks; their revolt of 1772 had only recently been put down.[3] Savelich listened with an air of deep disapproval, glancing suspiciously now at the innkeeper, now at our guide. The inn—though they called it by some more outlandish word of their own—was in the middle of the steppe, a long way from anywhere, and uncommonly like a brigands’ den. But there was nothing for it. Continuing on our way was out of the question. Anyway, I was amused by Savelich’s anxieties. I readied myself for the night and lay down on a bench. Savelich decided to sleep on top of the stove; the innkeeper lay down on the floor.

Выборный, услыша, что я требую лошадей, принял, было, меня довольно грубо, но мой вожатый сказал ему тихо несколько слов, и его суровость тотчас обратилась в торопливую услужливость. В одну минуту тройка была готова, я сел в тележку и велел себя везти в нашу деревню.","I paid generously to the rowers. One of them led me to the elected representative of the village, which was near the ferry. I went with him into the hut.

In one minute the troika was ready, I got into the cart and ordered myself to be taken to our village.","I paid the boatmen generously. One of them took me to the village elder, who was standing not far from the ferry stage. I followed him into a hut.

Three horses and a cart were quickly readied for me. I climbed in and told the driver to take me to my father’s estate.","I paid the oarsmen handsomely.

"Здесь прекращаются записки Петра Андреевича Гринева. Из семейственных преданий известно, что он был освобожден от заключения в конце 1774 года, по именному повелению; что он присутствовал при казни Пугачева, который узнал его в толпе и кивнул ему головою, которая через минуту, мертвая и окровавленная, показана была народу. Вскоре потом Петр Андреевич женился на Марье Ивановне. Потомство их благоденствует в Симбирской губернии. — В тридцати верстах от *** находится село, принадлежащее десятерым помещикам. — В одном из барских флигелей показывают собственноручное письмо Екатерины II за стеклом и в рамке.

Мы решились, с разрешения родственников, издать ее особо, приискав к каждой главе приличный эпиграф и дозволив себе переменить некоторые собственные имена.","Here the notes of Pyotr Andreevich Grinev stop. From family traditions it is known that he was released from prison at the end of 1774, by personal order; that he was present at the execution of Pugachev, who recognized him in the crowd and nodded his head to him, which a minute later, dead and bloodied, was shown to the people. Soon afterwards Pyotr Andreevich married Marya Ivanovna. Their offspring prosper in the Simbirsk province. - Thirty versts from *** is a village belonging to ten landowners. - In one of the lordly outbuildings, a handwritten letter from Catherine II is shown behind glass and in a frame. It is written to the father of Pyotr Andreevich and contains an excuse for his son and praise for the mind and heart of Captain Mironov's daughter. The manuscript of Pyotr Andreevich Grinev was delivered to us from one of his grandsons, who learned that we were busy with labor related to the times described by his grandfather.

"Пугачев посмотрел на меня с удивлением и ничего не отвечал. Оба мы замолчали, погрузясь каждый в свои размышления. Татарин затянул унылую песню; Савельич, дремля, качался на облучке. Кибитка летела по гладкому зимнему пути… Вдруг увидел я деревушку на крутом берегу Яика, с частоколом и с колокольней — и через четверть часа въехали мы в Белогорскую крепость.","Pugachev looked at me in surprise and did not answer. Both of us fell silent, each immersed in our own thoughts. The Tartar sang a sad song; Savelich, dozing, swayed on the irradiation. The wagon flew along the smooth winter road...

Suddenly I saw on the steep bank of the Yaïk a village with a palisade round it and a belfry rising above it—and in another quarter of an hour we drove into the Belogorsky fortress."
"«Господа енаралы!» — провозгласил важно Пугачев. — «Полна вам ссориться. Не беда, если б и все оренбургские собаки дрыгали ногами под одной перекладиной; беда, если наши кобели меж собою перегрызутся. Ну, помиритесь».","""Lords Enaraly!"" Pugachev announced importantly. “You are full of quarrels. It doesn't matter if all the Orenburg dogs kicked their legs under one crossbar; the trouble is, if our males gnaw among themselves. Well, make up your mind.""","“Gentlemen generals!” Pugachov said loftily. “Enough of your squabbling. I wouldn’t shed a tear if all the dogs in Orenburg were dangling from the same crossbeam, but it’s a bad day if our own fine hounds are at one another’s throats. Make it up!”","“My Generals,” Pugachov said pompously, “that’s enough quarreling!

There’s something I don’t like about all this. Say what you will, master, but I shan’t give him the money.”","There was nothing for it.

"С той поры положение мое переменилось. Марья Ивановна почти со мною не говорила, и всячески старалась избегать меня. Дом коменданта стал для меня постыл.

I met Shvabrin rarely and reluctantly, all the more so as I noticed in him a hidden dislike for myself, which confirmed me in my suspicions. My life has become unbearable to me. I fell into a gloomy reverie, which was nourished by loneliness and inactivity. My love flared up in solitude and from hour to hour became more painful to me. I have lost the desire for reading and literature. My spirit has fallen. I was afraid to either go crazy or fall into debauchery.

Lord, what have we come to!","“She’s at Akulina Pamfilovna’s. She fainted when she heard about Lower Lake. I’m afraid she may fall ill. Lord Almighty, that we should live to see this!”","“At Akulina Pamfilovna’s,” the Commandant’s wife answered. “She fainted when she heard about the Nizhneozerny being taken; I am afraid of her falling ill.” Vasilisa Yegorovna went to see about her daughter’s departure."
"Попадья ушла. Несколько успокоенный, я отправился к себе на квартиру. Проходя мимо площади, я увидел несколько башкирцев, которые теснились около виселицы и стаскивали сапоги с повешенных; с трудом удержал я порыв негодования, чувствуя бесполезность заступления. По крепости бегали разбойники, грабя офицерские дома. Везде раздавались крики пьянствующих мятежников. Я пришел домой. Савельич встретил меня у порога. «Слава богу!» — вскричал он, увидя меня. — «Я, было, думал, что злодеи опять тебя подхватили. Ну, батюшка Петр Андреич! веришь ли? все у нас разграбили, мошенники: платье, белье, вещи, посуду — ничего не оставили. Да что уж! Слава богу, что тебя живого отпустили! А узнал ли ты, сударь, атамана?».","Popadya left. Somewhat reassured, I went to my apartment. Passing by the square, I saw several Bashkirs crowding around the gallows and pulling off the boots from the hanged; with difficulty I restrained the impulse of indignation, feeling the futility of intercession. Robbers ran around the fortress, robbing the officers' houses. Everywhere there were cries of drunken rebels. I came home. Savelich met me at the door. ""God bless!"" he cried when he saw me. - “I used to think that the villains picked you up again. Well, Father Pyotr Andreevich! do you believe? everything was looted from us, swindlers: clothes, underwear, things, dishes - they left nothing. Yes, what! Thank God you were released alive! Did you recognize, sir, the chieftain?","Akulina Pamfilovna went back in. Somewhat reassured, I went back to my quarters. As I passed through the square, I saw some Bashkirs crowding around the gallows and dragging the boots off the hanged men’s feet. I was barely able to restrain myself, although I knew I was powerless to stop them. Everywhere men were running about, shouting drunkenly, looting the officers’ homes. I got back to my quarters. Savelich met me on the threshold. “Praise be to God!” he called out. “I was afraid they’d got hold of you again. Well, Pyotr Andreich, would you believe it? The rascals have robbed us of everything. Clothes, linen, crockery—they haven’t left us a thing. Still, who cares? Thank God they let you off with your life. But did you recognize their leader?”","The priest’s wife left me. I set off to my lodgings feeling somewhat calmer. As I passed through the market place I saw several Bashkirs, who crowded round the gallows, pulling the boots off the hanged men’s feet; I had difficulty in suppressing my indignation, but I knew that it would have been useless to intervene. The brigands were running about the fortress, plundering the officers’ quarters. The shouts of the drunken rebels resounded everywhere. I reached my lodgings. Savelyich met me at the threshold. “Thank God!” he cried, when he saw me. “I was afraid the villains had seized you again. Well, Pyotr Andreyich, my dear! Would you believe it, the rascals have robbed us of everything: clothes, linen, crockery—they have left nothing. But there! Thank God they let you off with your life! Did you recognize their leader, sir?”"
"Я бросился вон из комнаты, мигом очутился на улице и опрометью побежал в дом священника, ничего не видя и не чувствуя. Там раздавались крики, хохот и песни… Пугачев пировал с своими товарищами. Палаша прибежала туда же за мною. Я подослал ее вызвать тихонько Акулину Памфиловну. Через минуту попадья вышла ко мне в сени с пустым штофом в руках.","I rushed out of the room, instantly found myself on the street and ran headlong into the priest's house, seeing and feeling nothing. There were screams, laughter and songs ... Pugachev was feasting with his comrades. The broadsword ran there for me. I sent her to quietly summon Akulina Pamfilovna. A minute later the priest came out to me in the hallway with an empty damask in her hands.","I dashed out of the room. In only a moment I was running as fast as I could towards the priest’s house, noticing nothing around me. As I drew near, I heard shouts, laughter, and songs. Pugachov was feasting with his comrades. Palasha, I realized, had followed me. I told her to slip in and ask Akulina Pamfilovna to come out. A minute later, Akulina Pamfilovna appeared, holding an empty bottle.","I dashed out of the room, instantly found myself in the street and ran headlong to the priest’s house, not seeing or feeling anything.

A minute later the priest’s wife came into the entry to speak to me, with an empty bottle in her hands."
"«Ну, матушка», — возразил Иван Куэмич — «оставайся, пожалуй, коли ты на крепость нашу надеешься. Да с Машей-то что нам делать? Хорошо, коли отсидимся, или дождемся сикурса; ну, а коли злодеи возьмут крепость?»","“Well, mother,” Ivan Kuemich objected, “stay, perhaps, if you hope for our fortress. Yes, what should we do with Masha? Well, if we sit out, or wait for the securs; Well, what if the villains take the fortress?”","“All right, my dear,” replied Ivan Kuzmich. “Stay here if you’re so sure that our fortress is safe. But what are we to do about Masha? It’s all very well if we hold out, or if reinforcements arrive—but what if the villains capture the fortress?” “Well, if . . .”","“Well, my dear,” Ivan Kuzmich replied, “stay if you like, since you rely on our fortress. But what are we to do about Masha? It is all very well if we ward them off or last out till reinforcements come; but what if the villains take the fortress?”"

"«Постой, Иван Кузмич» — сказала комендантша, вставая с места. — «Дай уведу Машу куда-нибудь из дому; а то услышит крик, перепугается. Да и я, правду сказать, не охотница до розыска. Счастливо оставаться».","""Wait a minute, Ivan Kuzmich,"" said the commandant's wife, getting up from her seat. - “Let me take Masha somewhere from home; and then he hears a scream, gets scared. Yes, and I, to tell the truth, am not a hunter before the search. Happy to stay.""","“Wait, Ivan Kuzmich,” said Vasilisa Yegorovna, getting to her feet. “Let me take Masha out of the house. She’ll be scared out of her wits if she hears him screaming. And, to be honest, I don’t much care for these interrogations myself. I’ll be back in an hour or two.”","“Wait, Ivan Kuzmich,” said the Commandant’s wife, getting up. “Let me take Masha out of the house; she will be terrified if she hears the screams. And, to tell the truth, I don’t care for the business myself. Good luck to you.”"
"Вечер провел я, по обыкновению своему, у коменданта. Я старался казаться веселым и равнодушным, дабы не подать никакого подозрения и избегнуть докучных вопросов; но признаюсь, я не имел того хладнокровия, которым хвалятся почти всегда те, которые находились в моем положении. В этот вечер я расположен был к нежности и к умилению. Марья Ивановна нравилась мне более обыкновенного. Мысль, что, может быть, вижу ее в последний раз, придавала ей в моих глазах что-то трогательное. Швабрин явился тут же. Я отвел его в сторону и уведомил его о своем разговоре с Иваном Игнатьичем. «Зачем нам секунданты» — сказал он мне сухо, — «без них обойдемся». Мы условились драться за скирдами, что находились подле крепости, и явиться туда на другой день в седьмом часу утра. Мы разговаривали, по-видимому, так дружелюбно, что Иван Игнатьич от радости проболтался. «Давно бы так» — сказал он мне с довольным видом; — «худой мир лучше доброй ссоры, а и нечестен, так здоров».","I spent the evening, as usual, at the commandant's. I tried to appear cheerful and indifferent, so as not to arouse any suspicion and avoid annoying questions; but I confess that I did not have that composure, which is almost always boasted by those who were in my position. That evening I was disposed to tenderness and tenderness. I liked Marya Ivanovna more than usual. The thought that perhaps I was seeing her for the last time gave her something touching in my eyes. Shvabrin appeared immediately. I took him aside and informed him of my conversation with Ivan Ignatich. “Why do we need seconds,” he said to me dryly, “we can do without them.” We agreed to fight for stacks that were near the fortress, and to appear there the next day at seven o'clock in the morning. We talked, apparently, so friendly that Ivan Ignatich blabbed for joy. “It would have been like that for a long time,” he said to me with a pleased air; - ""a bad world is better than a good quarrel, and dishonest, so healthy.""","I spent the evening, as usual, at the commandant’s. I tried to appear cheerful and nonchalant, so as to avoid bothersome questions and not give grounds for suspicion. I must admit, however, that I felt none of the sangfroid of which men in my situation usually boast. That evening I felt tender and loving. I found Maria Ivanovna more appealing than ever. The thought that I might be seeing her for the last time made everything about her seem especially touching. Shvabrin called round too. I took him aside and told him about my conversation with Ivan Ignatich. “What do we want seconds for?” he replied drily. “We can do without them.” We agreed to fight behind the hayricks not far from the fortress and to meet there between six and seven the following morning. Our manner seemed so cordial that Ivan Ignatich, in his delight, very nearly gave us away. “And about time too!” he said with a pleased look. “A bad peace is better than a good quarrel, and a hale body is worth more than honor.”","I spent the evening, as usual, at the Commandant’s. I tried to appear cheerful and indifferent so as to escape inquisitive questions, and not give grounds for suspicion, but I confess I could not boast of the indifference which people in my position generally profess to feel.

The thought that I might be seeing her for the last time, made her seem particularly touching to me. Shvabrin was there also. I took him aside and told him of my conversation with Ivan Ignatyich. “What do we want with seconds?” he said to me, dryly. “We will do without them.” We arranged to fight behind the corn stacks near the fortress and to meet there the following morning between six and seven. We appeared to be talking so amicably that Ivan Ignatyich, delighted, let out the secret. “That’s right!” he said to me, looking pleased; “a bad peace is better than a good quarrel; a damaged name is better than a damaged skin.”"

"Василиса Егоровна ушла хлопотать об отъезде дочери. Разговор у коменданта продолжался; но я уже в него не мешался и ничего не слушал. Марья Ивановна явилась к ужину бледная и заплаканная. Мы отужинали молча, и встали изо стола скорее обыкновенного; простясь со всем семейством, мы отправились по домам. Но я нарочно забыл свою шпагу и воротился за нею: я предчувствовал, что застану Марью Ивановну одну. В самом деле, она встретила меня в дверях и вручила мне шпагу. «Прощайте, Петр Андреич!» — сказала она мне со слезами. — «Меня посылают в Оренбург. Будьте живы и счастливы; может быть, господь приведет нам друг с другом увидеться; если же нет…» Тут она зарыдала. Я обнял ее. — Прощай, ангел мой, — сказал я, — прощай, моя милая, моя желанная! Что бы со мною ни было, верь, что последняя моя мысль и последняя молитва будет о тебе! — Маша рыдала, прильнув к моей груди. Я с жаром ее поцаловал и поспешно вышел из комнаты.","Vasilisa Yegorovna went off to make arrangements for her daughter's departure. The commandant's conversation continued; but I no longer interfered with it and did not listen to anything. Marya Ivanovna appeared at supper pale and tearful. We supped in silence, and got up from the table rather than usual; Saying goodbye to the whole family, we went home. But I deliberately forgot my sword and went back for it: I had a presentiment that I would find Marya Ivanovna alone. In fact, she met me at the door and handed me a sword. ""Farewell, Pyotr Andreevich!"" she told me with tears. “They send me to Orenburg. Be alive and happy; maybe the Lord will bring us to see each other; if not…” Here she sobbed. I hugged her. “Farewell, my angel,” I said, “farewell, my dear, my beloved!” Whatever happens to me, believe that my last thought and last prayer will be about you! - Masha sobbed, clinging to my chest. I kissed her passionately and hurried out of the room.","Vasilisa Yegorovna went off to prepare for her daughter’s departure. The meeting in the commandant’s room continued, but I said nothing myself and failed to take in what anyone else said. When Maria Ivanovna came in to supper, her face was pale and her eyes red from weeping. We ate in silence and rose from the table earlier than usual; each of us taking leave of the entire family, we returned to our quarters. But I deliberately left my sword behind; I had a feeling that I would find Masha alone when I went back for it. She met me in the doorway and handed it to me. “Farewell, Pyotr Andreich!” she said with tears in her eyes. “I’m being sent to Orenburg. Keep safe and sound—and be happy. Maybe the Lord will permit us to meet again, but if not . . .” She burst out sobbing. I embraced her. “Farewell, my angel,” I said. “Farewell, my darling. Farewell, my heart’s desire. Whatever happens to me, don’t ever forget that my last thought and my last prayer will be for you!” Masha went on sobbing, her head pressed to my chest. I kissed her fervently and walked quickly out of the room.","Vasilisa Yegorovna went to see about her daughter’s departure. The conversation continued, but I took no part in it, and did not listen. Marya Ivanovna came in to supper, pale and with tear-stained eyes. We ate supper in silence and rose from the table sooner than usual; saying good-bye to the family, we went to our lodgings. But I purposely left my sword behind and went back for it; I had a feeling that I should find Marya Ivanovna alone. Indeed, she met me at the door and handed me my sword. “Good-bye, Pyotr Andreyich,” she said to me, with tears. “I am being sent to Orenburg. May you live and be happy; perhaps God will grant that we meet again, and if not …” She broke into sobs; I embraced her. “Good-bye, my angel,” I said, “good-bye, my sweet, my darling! Whatever happens to me, believe that my last thought and my last prayer will be for you!” Masha sobbed with her head on my shoulder. I kissed her ardently and hastened out of the room."
"«Принять надлежащие меры!» — сказал комендант, снимая очки и складывая бумагу. — «Слышь, ты, легко сказать. Злодей-то видно силен; а у нас всего сто тридцать человек, не считая казаков, на которых плоха надежда, не в укор буди тебе сказано, Максимыч. (Урядник усмехнулся). Однако делать нечего, господа офицеры! Будьте исправны, учредите караулы, да ночные дозоры; в случае нападения запирайте ворота, да выводите солдат. Ты, Максимыч смотри крепко за своими казаками.

The villain is evidently strong; and we have only one hundred and thirty people, not counting the Cossacks, on whom there is little hope, do not reproach you, Maksimych. (The officer chuckled). However, there is nothing to be done, gentlemen officers! Be efficient, establish guards, and night patrols; in case of an attack, lock the gates and bring out the soldiers. You, Maksimych, watch your Cossacks closely. Inspect the cannon, and clean it thoroughly. And most of all, keep all this a secret, so that no one in the fortress could find out about it prematurely.","“All necessary measures!” repeated Ivan Kuzmich, removing his glasses and folding the letter. “Yes indeed, but that’s easier said than done. The villain is clearly strong, and we’ve only got 130 men, not including the Cossacks, who cannot be relied upon, no offence meant, Maximich.” The sergeant smiled. “But we must do our best, fellow officers. Be vigilant, post sentries, and send out night patrols. In the event of an attack, lock the gates and assemble the men. You, Maximich, must keep a sharp eye on your Cossacks. Inspect the cannon and give it a thorough clean. And, above all: not a word to anyone. Let no one in the fortress know more than he needs to.”","“Take the necessary measures,” said the Commandant, removing his spectacles and folding the paper. “That’s easy enough to say, let me tell you.

Carry out your duties scrupulously, arrange for sentry duty and night patrols; in case of attack shut the gates and lead the soldiers afield.

"Мне было стыдно. Я отвернулся и сказал ему: Поди вон, Савельич; я чаю не хочу. Но Савельича мудрено было унять, когда, бывало, примется за проповедь. «Вот видишь ли, Петр Андреич, каково подгуливать. И головке-то тяжело, и кушать-то не хочется.

I turned away and said to him: Get out, Savelich; I don't want tea.

A person who drinks is good for nothing ... Drink some cucumber pickle with honey, and it would be better to get drunk with half a glass of tincture. Would you order?","I felt ashamed. I turned my back on him and said, “Go away, Savelich. I don’t want any tea.” But once Savelich got preaching it was not easy to stop him. “ So there’s the joys of drinking for you, Pyotr Andreich. Your head aches, and you don’t want to eat. A man who drinks is good for nothing. Have a little brine from the pickled cucumbers—you can take it with honey. Or best of all for the morning after is a half glass of vodka cordial. What do you say to that?”","I was ashamed. I turned away and said to him: “Leave me, Savelyich, I don’t want any tea.” But it was not easy to stop Savelyich once he began sermonizing. “You see now what it is to take too much, Pyotr Andreyich. Your head is heavy, and you have no appetite. A man who drinks is no good for anything…. Have some cucumber brine with honey or, better still, half a glass of homemade brandy.

You will see real service there and learn discipline. There is nothing for you to do at Orenburg; dissipation is bad for a young man. And tonight I shall be pleased to have you dine with me.”"
"Мы сели обедать. Василиса Егоровна не умолкала ни на минуту и осыпала меня вопросами: кто мои родители, живы ли они, где живут и каково их состояние? Услыша, что у батюшки триста душ крестьян, «легко ли!» — сказала она; — «ведь есть же на свете богатые люди! А у нас, мой батюшка, всего-то душ одна девка Палашка; да слава богу, живем помаленьку. Одна беда: Маша; девка на выданьи, а какое у ней приданое? частый гребень, да веник, да алтын денег (прости бог!), с чем в баню сходить. Хорошо, коли найдется добрый человек; а то сиди себе в девках вековечной невестою». — Я взглянул на Марью Ивановну; она вся покраснела, и даже слезы капнули на ее тарелку. Мне стало жаль ее; и я спешил переменить разговор. — Я слышал, — сказал я довольно некстати, — что на вашу крепость собираются напасть башкирцы. — «От кого, батюшка, ты изволил это слышать?» — спросил Иван Кузмич. — Мне так сказывали в Оренбурге, — отвечал я. «Пустяки!» — сказал комендант. — «У нас давно ничего не слыхать. Башкирцы — народ напуганный, да и киргизцы проучены. Небось, на нас не сунутся; а насунутся, так я такую задам острастку, что лет на десять угомоню». — И вам не страшно, — продолжал я, обращаясь к капитанше, — оставаться в крепости, подверженной таким опасностям? — «Привычка, мой батюшка», — отвечала она. — «Тому лет двадцать как нас из полка перевели сюда, и не приведи господи, как я боялась проклятых этих нехристей! Как завижу, бывало, рысьи шапки, да как заслышу их визг, веришь ли, отец мой, сердце так и замрет! А теперь так привыкла, что и с места не тронусь, как придут нам сказать, что злодеи около крепости рыщут».","We sat down to have lunch. Vasilisa Yegorovna did not stop for a minute and showered me with questions: who are my parents, are they alive, where do they live and what is their condition? Hearing that the priest has three hundred souls of peasants, “Is it easy!” - she said; “After all, there are rich people in the world! And with us, my father, there is only one shower girl Palashka; thank God, we live little by little. One trouble: Masha; a marriageable girl, and what dowry does she have? a frequent comb, and a broom, and an altyn of money (God forgive me!), with which to go to the bathhouse. Well, if there is a kind person; otherwise sit yourself in the girls as an eternal bride. — I glanced at Marya Ivanovna; she blushed all over, and even tears dripped onto her plate. I felt sorry for her; and I hastened to change the conversation. “I heard,” I said rather inappropriately, “that the Bashkirs are going to attack your fortress. “From whom, father, did you deign to hear this?” asked Ivan Kuzmich. “I was told so in Orenburg,” I replied. ""Nonsense!"" the commandant said. “We haven’t heard anything in a long time. The Bashkirs are a frightened people, and the Kyrgyz are taught a lesson. Probably, they won’t turn on us; but if they pop in, I’ll set such a wit that I’ll calm down for ten years. ” “And you are not afraid,” I continued, turning to the captain, “to remain in a fortress exposed to such dangers?” “A habit, my father,” she answered. “It’s been twenty years since we were transferred here from the regiment, and God forbid, how I was afraid of those damned infidels! As I envy, it used to be, lynx hats, but when I hear their squeal, do you believe it, my father, my heart will stop! And now I’m so used to it that I won’t even move when they come to tell us that the villains are prowling near the fortress. ”","We sat down to dinner. Vasilisa Yegorovna did not stop talking for a single moment. She showered me with questions: who were my parents? were they still alive? where did they live? what were their circumstances? On learning that my father had three hundred serfs, [7] she said, “Well, fancy that! Who’d have thought there are people in the world with such wealth? And we, dear sir, have only our one maid, Palashka. Still, thank the Lord, we manage to make ends meet. Our only sorrow is Masha: the girl should be marrying by now, but what does she have for a dowry? A fine-tooth comb, a besom broom and a three-kopek coin (God forgive me!) so she can go to the bathhouse. All very well if a good man comes her way, but otherwise she’ll remain an old maid till kingdom come.” I glanced at Maria Ivanovna. She was blushing profusely; there were even tears dropping onto her plate. I felt sorry for her and hurriedly changed the subject. “I’ve heard,” I remarked somewhat randomly, “that the Bashkirs [8] are planning to attack your fortress.” “Who did you hear that from, sir?” asked Ivan Kuzmich. “It’s what I was told in Orenburg,” I replied. “Stuff and nonsense!” said Ivan Kuzmich. “We haven’t heard so much as a whisper from them. The Bashkirs are a frightened lot, and we’ve put the wind up the Kirghiz [9] too. None of them will be sniffing around here in a hurry—and if they do, I’ll give them a lesson that will put the fear of God into them for the next ten years.” “But are you not afraid,” I said, turning to Vasilisa Yegorovna, “to remain in a fortress exposed to such dangers?” “You get used to it, good sir,” she replied. “Twenty years ago, when we were first transferred here from the regiment, God alone knows how scared I was of those accursed heathens. I’d only have to glimpse their lynx-fur caps or hear their yells and, believe me, my heart would stand still! But now, dear sir, I hardly bat an eyelid if someone reports that the villains are prowling around the fortress.”","We sat down to dinner. Vasilisa Yegorovna was never silent for a minute and bombarded me with questions: who were my parents, were they living, where did they live , how big was their estate? When she heard that my father had three hundred serfs she said: “Just fancy! to think of there being rich people in the world! And we, my dear, have only one maid, Palasha, but we are comfortable enough, thank heaven. The only trouble is Masha ought to be getting married, and all she has by way of dowry is a comb and a broom and a brass farthing, just enough to go to the baths with. If the right man turns up, all well and good, but, if not, she will die an old maid.” I glanced at Marya Ivanovna; she flushed crimson and tears dropped into her plate. I felt sorry for her and hastened to change the conversation. “I have heard,” I said, rather inappropriately, “that the Bashkirs propose to attack your fortress.” “From whom have you heard it, my good sir?” Ivan Kuzmich asked. “I was told it at Orenburg,” I answered. “Don’t you believe it!” said the Commandant. “We have not heard anything of it for years. The Bashkirs have been scared and the Kirghiz, too, have had their lesson. No fear, they won’t attack us; and if they do I will give them such a fright that they will keep quiet for another ten years.” “And you are not afraid,” I continued, turning to Vasilisa Yegorovna, “to remain in a fortress subject to such dangers?” “It’s a habit, my dear,” she answered. “Twenty years ago when we were transferred here from the regiment, I cannot tell you how I dreaded those accursed infidels! As soon as I saw their lynx caps and heard their squealing, my heart stood still, would you believe it! And now I have grown so used to it that I don’t stir when they tell us the villains are prowling round the fortress.”"
— У попадьи! — вскричал я с ужасом. — Боже мой! да там Пугачев!..,- At the bottom! I cried out in horror. - My God! yes there is Pugachev! ..,“At the priest’s house!” I cried out. “But that’s where Pugachov’s gone!”,"“At the priest’s!” I cried, in horror. “Good God! Pugachov is there!”"
"Но между тем странное чувство отравляло мою радость: мысль о злодее, обрызганном кровию стольких невинных жертв, и о казни, его ожидающей, тревожила меня поневоле: Емеля, Емеля! — думал я с досадою; — зачем не наткнулся ты на штык, или не подвернулся под картечь? Лучше ничего не мог бы ты придумать. Что прикажете делать? Мысль о нем неразлучна была во мне с мыслию о пощаде, данной мне им в одну из ужасных минут его жизни, и об избавлении моей невесты из рук гнусного Швабрина.","But in the meantime, a strange feeling poisoned my joy: the thought of the villain, splashed with the blood of so many innocent victims, and of the execution awaiting him, involuntarily disturbed me: Emelya, Emelya! I thought with annoyance; - why didn’t you stumble on a bayonet, or didn’t turn up under a buckshot? You couldn't think of anything better. What are you supposed to do? The thought of him was inseparable in me from the thought of the mercy he gave me in one of the terrible moments of his life, and of the deliverance of my bride from the hands of the vile Shvabrin.","My joy, however, was tainted by a strange feeling. For all the innocent blood this villain had shed, I felt troubled when I thought of the execution that awaited him. “Yemelka, Yemelka,’ [5] I thought irritably, “why didn’t you put yourself in the path of some grapeshot or get yourself run through by a bayonet? You could have done yourself no greater favor.” But then how could I not feel troubled? Pugachov had shown me mercy when he had been at his most terrible, and he had delivered my betrothed from the evil Shvabrin; it was impossible for me to remember him without remembering all he had done for me.",And yet a strange feeling poisoned my joy: I could not help being troubled at the thought of the villain smeared with the blood of so many innocent victims and now awaiting his punishment. “Why didn’t he fall on a bayonet? Or get hit with a cannonball?” I thought with vexation. “He could not have done anything better.” What will you have? I could not think of Pugachov without remembering how he had spared me at one of the awful moments of my life and saved my betrothed from the vile Shvabrin’s hands.

"Попадья стала угощать меня, чем бог послал. А между тем говорила без умолку. Она рассказала мне, каким образом Швабрин принудил их выдать ему Марью Ивановну; как Марья Ивановна плакала и не хотела с ними расстаться; как Марья Ивановна имела с нею всегдашние сношения через Палашку (девку бойкую, которая и урядника заставляет плясать по своей дудке); как она присоветовала Марьи Ивановне написать ко мне письмо и прочее. Я в свою очередь рассказал ей вкратце свою историю. Поп и попадья крестились, услыша, что Пугачеву известен их обман. «С нами сила крестная!» — говорила Акулина Памфиловна. — «Промчи бог тучу мимо. Ай-да Алексей Иваныч; нечего сказать: хорош гусь!» — В самую эту минуту дверь отворилась, и Марья Ивановна вошла с улыбкою на бледном лице. Она оставила свое крестьянское платье и одета была по-прежнему просто и мило.","Popadya began to treat me with what God sent. In the meantime, she spoke incessantly. She told me how Shvabrin forced them to hand over Marya Ivanovna to him; how Marya Ivanovna wept and did not want to part with them; how Marya Ivanovna had constant relations with her through Palashka (a lively girl who makes even a constable dance according to her tune); how she advised Marya Ivanovna to write a letter to me, and so on. I, in turn, told her briefly my story. The priest and priest were baptized when they heard that Pugachev was aware of their deceit. ""The power of the cross is with us!"" Akulina Pamfilovna said. - “God pass the cloud by. Ah yes, Alexei Ivanovich; nothing to say: good goose! At that very moment the door opened, and Marya Ivanovna came in with a smile on her pale face. She left her peasant dress and was still dressed simply and sweetly.","Akulina Pamfilovna put before me all the food she could find and did not stop talking for a single moment.

In return I briefly told them my own story. On learning that Pugachov now knew of their deceit, she and her husband crossed themselves. “The power of the Cross be with us!” said Akulina Pamfilovna. “May the Lord avert this storm cloud! But as for that Shvabrin . . . What a snake!” Just then the door opened and Maria Ivanovna came in, a smile on her pale face.

"Начинало смеркаться.[3] Путь мой шел мимо Бердской слободы, пристанища Пугачевского. Прямая дорога занесена была снегом; но по всей степи видны были конские следы, ежедневно обновляемые. Я ехал крупной рысью. Савельич едва мог следовать за мною издали, и кричал мне поминутно: «Потише, сударь, ради бога потише. Проклятая клячонка моя не успевает за твоим долгоногим бесом. Куда спешишь? Добро бы на пир, а то под обух, того и гляди… Петр Андреич… батюшка Петр Андреич!.. Не погуби!.. Господи владыко, пропадет барское дитя!».","It began to get dark.[3] My path went past the Berdskaya Sloboda, the refuge of Pugachevsky. The straight road was covered with snow; but horse tracks were visible all over the steppe, renewed daily. I rode at a big trot. Savelich could hardly follow me from a distance, and kept shouting to me: “Be quiet, sir, for God's sake be quiet. My damned nag can't keep up with your long-legged demon. Where are you hurrying? It would be nice to have a feast, otherwise you’ll be under the butt, and look ... Pyotr Andreevich ... father Pyotr Andreevich!","Darkness was falling. Our way led past the village of Berdy, which was now Pugachov’s stronghold. The road was deep in snow, but all over the steppe lay fresh tracks; horsemen were evidently going by every day. I was riding at a quick trot. Savelich could barely keep me in sight. “Not so fast, sir!” he was shouting. “For the love of God, not so fast! This damned nag of mine can’t keep up with your long-legged devil. And what’s the hurry? Anyone would think we were on our way to a feast but it’s more like to be our own funeral —mark my words! Pyotr Andreich! Master! Spare me! Lord God Almighty!","It was growing dark. My way lay through the village of Berda, which was occupied by Pugachov’s troops.

"Я прервал его речь вопросом: сколько у меня всего на все денег? «Будет с тебя» — отвечал он с довольным видом. — «Мошенники как там ни шарили, а я все-таки успел утаить». И с этим словом он вынул из кармана длинный вязаный кошелек полный серебра.[2] — Ну, Савельич, — сказал я ему, — отдай же мне теперь половину; а остальное возьми себе. Я еду в Белогорскую крепость.","I interrupted his speech with a question: how much money do I have for everything? “It will be with you,” he answered with a pleased look. - ""Scammers, no matter how they rummaged around, but I still managed to hide it."" And with that he took out of his pocket a long knitted purse full of silver.[2] “Well, Savelich,” I said to him, “give me half now; and take the rest. I'm going to the Belogorsk fortress.","I cut his speech short with a question: how much money did we have, all told? “Enough for all your needs,” he replied with a look of satisfaction. “The rogues ransacked and rummaged, but I still managed to hide this from them.” And he drew from his pocket a long knitted purse full of silver. “Very well, Savelich,” I said. “Give me half, and keep the rest for yourself.

Барабан умолк; гарнизон бросил ружья; меня сшибли, было, с ног, но я встал и вместе с мятежниками вошел в крепость. Комендант, раненный в голову, стоял в кучке злодеев, которые требовали от него ключей. Я бросился было к нему на помощь: несколько дюжих казаков схватили меня и связали кушаками, приговаривая: «Вот ужо вам будет, государевым ослушникам!» Нас потащили по улицам; жители выходили из домов с хлебом и солью.

I was almost knocked off my feet, but I picked myself up and went back into the fortress along with the rebels. I saw a group of men standing around Ivan Kuzmich, who had been wounded in the head; they were demanding his keys. I was about to rush to his aid, but some burly Cossacks seized me and bound me with their belts, repeating, “Defying the Tsar! We’ll teach you to defy the Tsar!” We were dragged through the streets; people came out of their houses, offering the rebels bread and salt.[2] The church bells were ringing. People began shouting that the Tsar was in the main square, receiving oaths of allegiance and waiting for the prisoners to be brought before him.

The drum stopped; the soldiers threw down their rifles; I was knocked down, but got up again and walked into the fortress together with the rebels.

The idea of embracing them, of seeing Marya Ivanovna, from whom I had no news, animated me with delight. I jumped like a child. Zurin laughed and said, shrugging his shoulders: “No, you can’t do well! If you get married, you'll be lost for nothing!""","Pugachov was in flight, pursued by General Michelsohn.[4] Soon word came that he had been routed. Finally Zurin received news of his capture and, at the same time, orders to march no further. The war was over. At last I could go home to my parents.

Zurin laughed and said with a shrug, “No, no good will come of it. If you marry, you’re done for—and all for nothing.”","Pugachov was in retreat, pursued by Ivan Ivanovich Michelson.

"— Это Швабрин, сказал я Гриневу.","“This is Shvabrin,” I said to Grinev.","“It’s Shvabrin,” I told Zurin.","“It is Shvabrin,” I said to Zurin."
"Швабрин удалился, и остав караул у анбара. Мы молчали. Каждый из нас думал про себя, не смея сообщить другому своих мыслей. —Я воображал себе все, что в состоянии был учинить озлобленный Швабрин. О себе я почти не заботился. Признаться ли? И участь родителей моих не столько ужасала меня, как судьба Марьи Ивановны. Я знал, что матушка была обожаема крестьянами и дворовыми людьми, батюшка, несмотря на свою строгость, был также любим, ибо был справедлив и знал истинные нужды подвластных ему людей. Бунт их был заблуждение, мгновенное пьянство, а не изъявление их негодования. Тут пощада была вероятна. Но Марья Ивановна? Какую участь готовил ей развратный и бессовестный человек! Я не смел остановить на этой ужасной мысли и готовился, прости господи, скорее умертвить ее, нежели вторично увидеть в руках жестокого недруга.","Shvabrin retired and left the guard at the Anbar. We were silent. Each of us thought to himself, not daring to communicate his thoughts to the other. - I imagined everything that the embittered Shvabrin was able to do. I hardly cared about myself. Do you confess? And the fate of my parents did not horrify me so much as the fate of Marya Ivanovna. I knew that mother was adored by the peasants and courtyards, the father, despite his strictness, was also loved, for he was fair and knew the true needs of the people subject to him. Their rebellion was a delusion, instant drunkenness, and not an expression of their indignation. Here mercy was likely. But Marya Ivanovna? What fate was prepared for her by a depraved and unscrupulous man! I did not dare stop at this terrible thought and prepared, God forgive me, rather to kill it than to see it again in the hands of a cruel enemy.","Shvabrin walked away, leaving guards by the door. We all remained silent. Each of us was thinking his own thoughts, afraid to voice them. I knew that Shvabrin, in his embitterment, was capable of anything. My own fate hardly concerned me. What frightened me most, I have to confess, was not the possible fate of my parents but the thought of what might happen to Maria Ivanovna. I knew that Mother was adored by the peasants and house serfs alike. Father, for all his severity, was also much loved; he was just and he understood the true needs of the serfs who worked for him. Their revolt was an aberration, a momentary intoxication rather than an expression of genuine discontent. My parents would almost certainly be spared. Whereas Maria Ivanovna . . . Shvabrin was depraved and shameless. I did not dare dwell on the awful thought of what he might do to Maria Ivanovna and I readied myself (God forgive me!) to kill her with my own sword rather than let her fall a second time into Shvabrin’s hands.","Shvabrin went away, leaving sentries at the door. We were silent, each of us thinking his own thoughts, not daring to express them to the others. I was picturing to myself all that Shvabrin was capable of doing in his malice. I hardly cared about myself. Must I confess it? Even my parents’ fate terrified me less than Marya Ivanovna’s. I knew that my mother was adored by the peasants and the house serfs. My father, too, was loved in spite of his sternness, for he was just and knew the true needs of the men he owned. Their rebellion was a delusion, a passing intoxication, and not the expression of their resentment. It was possible that my parents would be spared. But Marya Ivanovna? What did the dissolute and unscrupulous man hold in store for her? I did not dare to dwell upon this awful thought and would have killed her (God forgive me!) sooner than see her fall once more into the hands of the cruel enemy."

"Матушка, на минуту обрадованная моим появлением, впала в отчаяние, видя, что пришлось и мне разделить погибель всей семьи. Но я был спокойнее с тех пор, как находился с ними и с Марьей Ивановной.

«Что ж?» — спросил Пугачев. — «Страшно тебе?»,"""Well?"" asked Pugachev. - ""Are you scared?""","“So,” said Pugachov, “are you afraid?”","“Well, are you afraid?” Pugachov asked."
"Не смотря на все наши предосторожности, весть о появлении Пугачева разнеслась по крепости. Иван Кузмич, хоть и очень уважал свою супругу, но ни за что на свете не открыл бы ей тайны, вверенной ему по службе. Получив письмо от генерала, он довольно искусным образом выпроводил Василису Егоровну, сказав ей, будто бы отец Герасим получил из Оренбурга какие-то чудные известия, которые содержит в великой тайне. Василиса Егоровна тотчас захотела отправиться в гости к попадье и, по совету Ивана Кузмича взяла с собою и Машу, чтоб ей не было скучно одной.","Despite all our precautions, the news of Pugachev's appearance spread throughout the fortress. Ivan Kuzmich, although he had great respect for his wife, would never have revealed to her the secret entrusted to him in his service. Having received a letter from the general, he escorted Vasilisa Yegorovna out in a rather skillful manner, telling her that Father Gerasim had received some wonderful news from Orenburg, which he kept in great secrecy. Vasilisa Yegorovna immediately wanted to visit the priest and, on the advice of Ivan Kuzmich, took Masha with her, so that she would not be bored alone.","In spite of all our precautions, the news about Pugachov spread through the fortress. Much as Ivan Kuzmich respected his wife, nothing in the world would have induced him to tell her confidential information. On receiving the General’s letter, he had rather skillfully got her out of the way by saying that Father Gerasim had, it appeared, received some remarkable news from Orenburg but was keeping it a great secret. Vasilisa Yegorovna at once wanted to go and call on the priest’s wife, Akulina Pamfilovna; on her husband’s advice, she took Masha along with her, so the girl wouldn’t be left all on her own.","In spite of all our precautions the news of Pugachov spread throughout the fortress.

"Караульный медлил. Я выскочил из телеги, треснул его (виноват) в ухо — и сам отодвинул рогатку. Мужик мой глядел на меня с глупым недоумением. Я сел опять в телегу (и) велел скакать к барскому дому. Хлебный анбар находился на дворе. У запертых дверей стояли два мужика так с дубинами. Телега остановилась прямо перед ними. Я выскочил и бросился прямо на них. — Отворяйте двери! — сказал я им. Вероятно, вид мой был страшен. По крайней мере, оба убежали, бросив дубины. Я попытался сбить замок, а двери выломать, но двери были дубовые, а огромный замок несокрушим. В эту минуту статный молодой мужик вышел из людской избы, и с видом надменным спросил меня, как я смею буянить. — Где Андрюшка земский? — закричал я ему. — Кликнуть его ко мне.","The guard hesitated. I jumped out of the cart, cracked him (guilty) in the ear - and pushed the slingshot away myself. My man looked at me with stupid bewilderment. I got into the cart again (and) ordered to gallop to the manor's house. The grain bin was in the yard. At the locked doors stood two men with clubs. The cart stopped right in front of them. I jumped out and ran straight at them. - Open the doors! I told them. I must have looked terrible. At least they both ran away, leaving their clubs behind. I tried to knock down the lock and break down the doors, but the doors were oak, and the huge castle is indestructible. At that moment, a stately young peasant came out of the people's hut, and with an air of arrogance asked me how dare I rage. - Where is Andryushka Zemsky? I shouted at him. - Call him to me.","The sentry seemed in no hurry. I jumped out of the cart, boxed him (I have to confess) on the ear and lifted the barrier. The peasant looked at me with stupid amazement. I got back into the cart and told the driver to go on to the house as quickly as possible. The granary was in the courtyard. Two more peasants with clubs stood by the door, which was locked. I leapt out and made straight for them. “Open the door!” I commanded. I must have looked frightening; both of them, in any case, dropped their clubs and fled. I tried to wrench off the padlock and force the door, but the door was oak and the huge padlock impregnable. Just then a tall, young peasant came out of a hut and asked haughtily why I was making such a disturbance. “Where is Andryushka, the clerk?” I shouted. “Bring the man here!”","The watchman did not move. I jumped out of the carriage, gave him a box on the ear, I am sorry to say, and lifted the bar myself. The peasant looked at me in stupid perplexity. I took my seat in the carriage once more and told the driver to drive to the house as fast as he could. Two peasants, armed with clubs, were standing by the locked doors of the granary. The carriage drew up just in front of them. I jumped out and rushed at them. “Open the doors!” I said to them. I must have looked formidable, for they threw down their clubs and ran away. I tried to knock the lock off the door or to pick it, but the doors were of oak and the huge lock was unbreakable. At that moment a young peasant came out of the servants’ quarters and haughtily asked me how I dared to make a disturbance. “Where is Andryushka, the headman?” I shouted to him. “Call him to me.”"

"Вскоре засверкали Бердские огни. Мы подъехали к оврагам, естественным укреплениям слободы. Савельич от меня не отставал, не прерывая жалобных своих молений. Я надеялся объехать слободу благополучно, как вдруг увидел в сумраке прямо перед собой человек пять мужиков, вооруженных дубинами; это был передовой караул пугачевского пристанища. Нас окликали. Не зная пароля, я хотел молча проехать мимо их; но они меня тотчас окружили, и один из них схватил лошадь мою за узду. Я выхватил саблю, и ударил мужика по голове; шапка спасла его, однако он зашатался и выпустил из рук узду. Прочие смутились и отбежали; я воспользовался этой минутою, пришпорил лошадь и поскакал.","Soon the Byrd lights flashed. We drove up to the ravines, the natural fortifications of the settlement. Savelich did not lag behind me, without interrupting his plaintive prayers. I was hoping to go around the settlement safely, when suddenly I saw in the dusk right in front of me about five peasants armed with clubs; it was the advanced guard of the Pugachev refuge. We were called. Not knowing the password, I wanted to silently drive past them; but they immediately surrounded me, and one of them seized my horse by the bridle. I drew my sword and hit the peasant on the head; the cap saved him, but he staggered and let go of the bridle. Others were confused and ran away; I took advantage of this moment, spurred my horse and galloped off.","The master’s child—this is going to be the death of the master’s child!” Soon we could see the lights of Berdy.

I was hoping to skirt the village unnoticed when suddenly, in the gloom ahead, I made out five men armed with cudgels; we had come to one of Pugachov’s outposts. The men challenged us. Not knowing the password, I tried to ride on without answering, but I was instantly surrounded and one of the men seized my horse’s bridle. I drew my sword and struck him over the head. His hat saved his life, but he staggered and dropped the bridle. The others took to their heels. Making the most of this moment of confusion, I put spurs to my horse and galloped off.","The lights of Berda soon came into sight.

"Я находился в том состоянии чувств и души, когда существенность, уступая мечтаниям, сливается с ними в неясных видениях первосония. Мне казалось, буран еще свирепствовал, и мы еще блуждали по снежной пустыне… Вдруг увидел я вороты, и въехал на барской двор нашей усадьбы. Первою мыслию моею было опасение, чтобы батюшка не прогневался на меня за невольное возвращение под кровлю родительскую, и не почел бы его умышленным ослушанием. С беспокойством я выпрыгнул из кибитки, и вижу: матушка встречает меня на крыльце с видом глубокого огорчения. «Тише», — говорит она мне — «отец болен при смерти и желает с тобою проститься». — Пораженный страхом, я иду за нею в спальню. Вижу, комната слабо освещена; у постели стоят люди с печальными лицами. Я тихонько подхожу к постеле; матушка приподымает полог и говорит: «Андрей Петрович, Петруша приехал; он воротился, узнав о твоей болезни; благослови его». Я стал на колени, и устремил глаза мои на больного. Что ж?… Вместо отца моего, вижу в постеле лежит мужик с черной бородою, весело на меня поглядывая. Я в недоумении оборотился к матушке, говоря ей: — Что это значит? Это не батюшка. И к какой мне стати просить благословения у мужика? — «все равно, Петруша», — отвечала мне матушка — «это твой посаженый отец; поцалуй у него ручку, и пусть он тебя благословит…» Я не соглашался. Тогда мужик вскочил с постели, выхватил топор из-за спины, и стал махать во все стороны. Я хотел бежать… и не мог; комната наполнилась мертвыми телами; я спотыкался о тела и скользил в кровавых лужах… Страшный мужик ласково меня кликал, говоря: «Не бойсь, подойди под мое благословение…» Ужас и недоумение овладели мною… И в эту минуту я проснулся; лошади стояли; Савельич дергал меня за руку, говоря: «Выходи сударь: приехали».","I was in that state of feelings and soul when materiality, yielding to dreams, merges with them in obscure visions of the first dream. It seemed to me that the storm was still raging, and we were still wandering through the snowy desert ... Suddenly I saw the gate, and drove into the manor yard of our estate. My first thought was the fear that the priest would not be angry with me for my involuntary return to my parents' roof, and would not consider it a deliberate disobedience. With anxiety, I jumped out of the wagon, and I see: mother meets me on the porch with an air of deep chagrin. “Hush,” she says to me, “father is ill at death and wants to say goodbye to you.” “Stricken with fear, I follow her into the bedroom. I see the room is dimly lit; people with sad faces are standing by the bed. I quietly approach the bed; mother lifts the curtain and says: “Andrei Petrovich, Petrusha has arrived; he returned when he learned about your illness; bless him."" I knelt down and fixed my eyes on the patient. Well? ... Instead of my father, I see a man with a black beard lying in bed, looking at me cheerfully. I turned to my mother in bewilderment, saying to her: ""What does this mean?"" This is not a dad. And why should I ask for blessings from a peasant? “It doesn’t matter, Petrusha,” my mother answered me, “this is your planted father; kiss his hand and let him bless you ... ”I did not agree. Then the peasant jumped out of bed, grabbed the ax from behind his back, and began to wave in all directions. I wanted to run... and I couldn't; the room filled with dead bodies; I stumbled over bodies and slid in bloody puddles... A terrible peasant called me affectionately, saying: ""Don't be afraid, come under my blessing..."" Horror and bewilderment seized me... And at that moment I woke up; the horses were standing; Savelich tugged at my hand, saying: ""Come out, sir; we've arrived.""","I was in that mental and emotional state when reality, yielding to reverie, merges with it in the unclear visions of the beginning of sleep. I dreamed that the storm was still raging and that we were still lost on the snow-covered steppe. All of a sudden I saw a gateway, and I drove into the courtyard of our manor house. My first thought was that my father might be angered by my involuntary return and regard it as deliberate disobedience. Jumping down anxiously from the sleigh, I see my mother. She is coming out to meet me, a look of deep grief on her face. “Hush,” she says, “your father is mortally ill and wishes to say farewell to you.” I follow her fearfully into the bedroom. The room is dimly lit; around the bed are people with sad faces. I tiptoe up to the bed. Mother lifts a corner of the curtain and says, “Andrey Petrovich, Petrusha has come. He heard of your illness and turned back. Give him your blessing.” I kneel down and look at the sick man. But . . . instead of my father, I see a peasant with a black beard lying on the bed, looking up at me cheerfully. I turn to Mother in bewilderment and say, “What’s going on? This isn’t Father. Why should I ask a peasant for his blessing?” “Never mind, Petrusha,” says Mother. “He’s taking Father’s place at your wedding. Kiss his hand and let him give you his blessing.” I refuse. Then the peasant jumps out of bed, draws the ax that was tucked into his belt behind him and begins swinging it about in all directions. I want to run and I can’t; the room fills with dead bodies; I stumble against the bodies and slip in pools of blood. The terrible peasant calls out to me gently, “Don’t be frightened. Come and receive my blessing.” Horror and bewilderment overwhelm me. At that moment I awoke. The horses had stopped; Savelich was tugging me by the arm and saying, “Get out, sir, we’ve arrived.”","I was in that state of mind and feeling when reality gives way to dreams and merges into them in the shadowy visions of oncoming sleep. It seemed to me the storm was still raging and we were still wandering in the snowy desert…. Suddenly I saw a gateway and drove into the courtyard of our estate. My first thought was fear lest my father should be angry with me for my involuntary return and regard it as an intentional disobedience. Anxious, I jumped down from the chaise and saw my mother, who came out to meet me on the steps, with an air of profound grief. “Don’t make any noise,” she said. “Your father is ill; he is dying and wants to say good-bye to you.” Terror-stricken, I followed her to the bedroom. It was dimly lighted; people with sad-looking faces were standing by the bed. I approached the bed quietly; my mother lifted the bed-curtain and said: “Andrey Petrovich! Petrusha has come; he returned when he heard of your illness; bless him.” I knelt down and looked at the sick man. But what did I see? Instead of my father a black-bearded peasant lay on the bed looking at me merrily. I turned to my mother in perplexity, and said to her: “What does it mean? This is not my father. And why should I ask this peasant’s blessing?”—“Never mind, Petrusha,” my mother answered, “he takes your father’s place for the wedding; kiss his hand and let him bless you.” … I would not do it. Then the peasant jumped off the bed, seized an ax from behind his back, and began waving it about. I wanted to run away and could not; the room was full of dead bodies; I stumbled against them and slipped in the pools of blood…. The terrible peasant called to me kindly, saying: “Don’t be afraid, come and let me bless you.” Terror and confusion possessed me…. At that moment I woke up. The horses were standing still; Savelyich held me by the hand, saying: “Come out, sir; we have arrived.”"

"Около полудни услышали мы необычайный шум и крики. — Что это значит, сказал отец, уж не твой ли полковник подоспел? — Не возможно, отвечал я. Он не будет прежде вечера. Шум умножался. Били в набат. По двору скакали конные люди; в эту минуту в узкое отверстие, прорубленное в стене, просунулась седая голова Савельича, и мой бедный дядька произнес жалостным голосом: — Андрей Петрович, Авдотья Васильевна, батюшка ты мой, Петр Андреич, матушка Марья Ивановна, беда! злодеи вошли в село. И знаешь ли, Петр Андреич, кто их привел? Швабрин, Алексей Иваныч, нелегкое его побери! — Услыша ненавистное имя, Марья Ивановна всплеснула руками и осталась неподвижною.","Around noon we heard an unusual noise and screams. - What does it mean, said the father, is your colonel arrived in time? “Not possible,” I replied. He won't be here before evening. The noise multiplied. They beat the alarm. Equestrian people galloped around the yard; At that moment, Savelich's gray-haired head stuck his head through a narrow hole cut in the wall, and my poor uncle said in a pitiful voice: ""Andrey Petrovich, Avdotya Vasilyevna, you are my father, Pyotr Andreevich, mother Marya Ivanovna, trouble!"" villains entered the village. And do you know, Pyotr Andreich, who brought them? Shvabrin, Alexei Ivanovich, take him hard! - Hearing the hateful name, Marya Ivanovna threw up her hands and remained motionless.","Around midday we heard an extraordinary uproar. “What do you think it is?” asked Father. “Is it your major already?” “No,” I said, “it can’t be him yet. It’s too early.” The noise increased. The tocsin was sounded. Mounted men were galloping across the yard.[4] Then Savelich thrust his grey head through a narrow opening in the wall and said in a pitiful voice, “Andrey Petrovich, Avdotya Vasilyevna, dear Pyotr Andreich, Maria Ivanovna! Terrible news! The bandits are in the village. And who do you think is leading them, Pyotr Andreich? Shvabrin—may the devil take him!” Hearing that hateful name, Maria Ivanovna threw up her hands in horror.","About midday we heard extraordinary uproar and shouting. “What does this mean?” my father said. “Can it already be your colonel?” “Impossible,” I answered. “He won’t come before evening.” The noise increased. The alarm bell was rung. We heard men on horseback galloping across the yard. At that moment Savelyich’s gray head was thrust through the narrow opening cut in the wall and the poor old man said in a pitiful voice: “Andrey Petrovich! Pyotr Andreyich, my dear! Marya Ivanovna! We are lost! The villains have come into the village. And do you know who has brought them, Pyotr Andreyich? Shvabrin, Alexey Ivanych, damnation take him!” When Marya Ivanovna heard the hated name she clasped her hands and remained motionless."
"Чтоб утешить бедного Савельича, я дал ему слово впредь без его согласия не располагать ни одною копейкою. Он мало-помалу успокоился, хотя все еще изредка ворчал про себя, качая головою: «Сто рублей! легко ли дело!»","In order to console poor Savelich, I gave him my word that I would never have a single penny at my disposal without his consent. Little by little he calmed down, although from time to time he still grumbled to himself, shaking his head: “A hundred roubles! is it easy!""","To console poor Savelich, I promised from then on not to spend so much as a kopek without his consent. Gradually he calmed down, though he went on shaking his head now and again and muttering, “A hundred rubles! That’s no joke!”","To comfort poor Savelyich I gave him my word not to dispose of a single farthing without his consent in the future. He calmed down after a time, though now and again he still muttered to himself, shaking his head: “A hundred rubles! It’s no joke!”"
"Я испугался, увидя его завлеченного в военные рассуждения, и спешил его прервать. — Дочь капитана Миронова, — сказал я ему, — пишет ко мне письмо: она просит помощи; Швабрин принуждает ее выдти за него замуж.","I was frightened when I saw him lured into military discussions, and hastened to interrupt him. “Captain Mironov’s daughter,” I told him, “is writing a letter to me: she asks for help; Shvabrin forces her to marry him.","Dismayed to see him entering into a discourse on military tactics, I hurriedly interrupted. “The daughter of Captain Mironov,” I said, “has written to me. She is asking for help. Shvabrin is trying to force her to marry him.”","I was afraid he would enter upon a military discussion and made haste to interrupt him. “Captain Mironov’s daughter,” I said to him, “has sent me a letter; she begs for help; Shvabrin is forcing her to marry him.”"
"Я со слезами цаловал его руку и глядел на Марью Ивановну, которая была так обрадована моим присутствием, что казалась совершенно счастлива и спокойна.","I kissed his hand with tears and looked at Marya Ivanovna, who was so delighted with my presence that she seemed completely happy and calm.","I wept and kissed his hand and looked at Maria Ivanovna, who was so glad to see me that she seemed entirely happy and calm.","I kissed his hand with tears and gazed at Marya Ivanovna, who was so overjoyed at my presence that she seemed quite calm and happy."

"Однажды, когда удалось нам как-то рассеять и прогнать довольно густую толпу, наехал я на казака, отставшего от своих товарищей; я готов был уже ударить его своею турецкою саблею, как вдруг он снял шапку и закричал: «Здравствуйте, Петр Андреич! Как вас бог милует?»","Once, when we managed to somehow disperse and drive away a rather dense crowd, I ran into a Cossack who had lagged behind his comrades; I was about to hit him with my Turkish saber, when suddenly he took off his hat and shouted: “Hello, Pyotr Andreevich!

"Иван Кузмич вполне соглашался с своею супругою и приговаривал: «А слышь ты, Василиса Егоровна правду говорит. Поединки формально запрещены в воинском артикуле». Между тем Палашка взяла у нас наши шпаги и отнесла в чулан. Я не мог не засмеяться. Швабрин сохранил свою важность. «При всем моем уважении к вам» — сказал он ей хладнокровно — «не могу не заметить, что напрасно вы изволите беспокоиться, подвергая нас вашему суду. Предоставьте это Ивану Кузмичу: это его дело». — Ах! мой батюшка! — возразила комендантша; — да разве муж и жена не един дух и едина плоть? Иван Кузмич! Что ты зеваешь? Сейчас рассади их по разным углам на хлеб да на воду, чтоб у них дурь-то прошла; да пусть отец Герасим наложит на них эпитимию, чтоб молили у бога прощения, да каялись перед людьми.","Ivan Kuzmich fully agreed with his wife and said: “Do you hear, Vasilisa Yegorovna speaks the truth. Fights are formally prohibited in the military article. Meanwhile Palashka took our swords from us and took them to the closet. I couldn't help laughing. Shvabrin retained his importance. “With all due respect to you,” he said to her coolly, “I can’t help but notice that you need not worry about putting us under your judgment. Leave it to Ivan Kuzmich: that's his business."" — Ah! my dad! objected the commandant; Are not husband and wife one spirit and one flesh? Ivan Kuzmich! What are you yawning? Now seat them in different corners for bread and water, so that they get rid of nonsense; Yes, let Father Gerasim impose penance on them, so that they pray to God for forgiveness, and repent before people.","Ivan Kuzmich, of course, agreed with his wife. He kept repeating, “Yes indeed, Vasilisa Yegorovna is right. Dueling is expressly forbidden by the Code of War Articles.” Meanwhile, Palashka took our swords and put them away in the storeroom. I could not help laughing. Shvabrin maintained his air of self-importance. “With all due respect,” he said coolly to Vasilisa Yegorovna, “I cannot but remark that, by appointing yourself as our judge, you are putting yourself to unnecessary trouble. Leave this matter to Ivan Kuzmich. It is for him to decide what to do.” “But my dear sir,” Vasilisa Yegorovna retorted, “are not husband and wife one flesh? Ivan Kuzmich! Don’t just stand there gaping! Lock them up at once, in different ends of the house. And keep them on bread and water till they come to their senses. And have Father Gerasim impose a penance on them, so they pray God for forgiveness and show themselves repentant before their fellow men!”","Ivan Kuzmich fully agreed with his wife, and kept repeating: “ Vasilisa Yegorovna is quite right; let me tell you duels are explicitly forbidden in the army regulations.” Meanwhile Palasha took our swords and carried them to the pantry. I could not help laughing; Shvabrin retained his dignity. “With all respect for you,” he said coolly, “I must observe that you give yourself unnecessary trouble in passing judgment upon us. Leave it to Ivan Kuzmich—it is his business.” “But, my dear sir, aren’t husband and wife one flesh and one spirit?” the Commandant’s lady retorted. “Ivan Kuzmich, what are you thinking of? Put them under arrest at once in different corners and give them nothing but bread and water till they come to their senses! And let Father Gerasim set them a penance that they may beg God to forgive them and confess their sin to the people.”"

"«Вы просите за Гринева?» — сказала дама с холодным видом. — «Императрица не может его простить. Он пристал к самозванцу не из невежества и легковерия, но как безнравственный и вредный негодяй».","“Are you asking for Grinev?” said the lady coldly. “The Empress cannot forgive him. He stuck to the impostor not out of ignorance and gullibility, but as an immoral and harmful scoundrel.",“You are pleading for Grinyov?” the lady said coldly. “The Empress cannot pardon him. It was not ignorance and credulity that led him to go over to the impostor; his desertion was the act of a depraved and dangerous scoundrel.”,"“You are interceding for Grinyov?” the lady said coldly. “The Empress cannot forgive him. He joined the Pretender not from ignorance and credulity, but as a dangerous and immoral scoundrel.”"

"Он отпер двери. Огонь ворвался и взвился по бревнам, законопаченным сухим мохом. Батюшка выстрелил из пистолета и шагнул за пылающий порог, закричав: «Все за мною». (Я схватил) за руки матушку Марью Ивановну и быстро вывел их на воздух. У порога лежал Швабрин, простреленный дряхлою рукою отца моего; толпа разбойников, бежавшая от неожиданной нашей вылазки, тотчас ободрилась и начала нас окружать. Я успел нанести еще несколько ударов, но кирпич, удачно брошенный, угодил мне прямо в грудь. Я упал и на минуту лишился чувств. Пришед в себя, увидел я Швабрина, сидевшего на окровавленной траве, и перед ним все наше семейство. Меня поддерживали под руки. Толпа крестьян, казаков и башкирцев окружала нас. Швабрин был ужасно бледен. Одной рукой прижимал он раненый бок. Лицо его изображало мучение и злобу. Он медленно поднял голову, взглянул на меня и произнес слабым и невнятным голосом:","He unlocked the doors. The fire broke in and soared over the logs, caulked with dry moss. Batiushka fired his pistol and stepped over the flaming threshold, shouting: ""Everyone is behind me."" (I grabbed) mother Marya Ivanovna by the hands and quickly brought them out into the air. At the threshold lay Shvabrin, shot through by my father's decrepit hand; the crowd of robbers, who had fled from our unexpected sortie, immediately took courage and began to surround us. I managed to deliver a few more blows, but the brick, successfully thrown, hit me right in the chest. I fell and fainted for a minute. When I came to my senses, I saw Shvabrin sitting on the bloodstained grass, and in front of him was our whole family. They supported me by the arms. A crowd of peasants, Cossacks and Bashkirs surrounded us. Shvabrin was terribly pale. With one hand he pressed his wounded side. His face showed pain and anger. He slowly raised his head, looked at me and said in a weak and indistinct voice:","He opened the door. Flames leaped in and twisted along the beams and the dry moss stuffed into the gaps between them. Father fired his pistol and strode over the blazing threshold, shouting, “Follow me!” I took both Mother and Maria Ivanovna by the hand and led them quickly out into the open. Not far from the entrance Shvabrin lay stretched out on the ground, shot by my aged father. The rest of the mob had fled, but they quickly recovered their spirits and began to press round us again. I laid about me with my sword but a well-aimed brick struck me full in the chest. I fell to the ground and briefly lost consciousness. When I came to, I saw Shvabrin sitting on the blood-soaked grass with my family standing before him. I was being supported under each arm. We were surrounded by a crowd of peasants, Cossacks, and Bashkirs. Shvabrin was very pale. He was pressing one hand to his wounded side. On his face was a look of mingled pain and rage. He slowly lifted his head, looked at me, and said in a weak, indistinct voice, “Hang him . . .","He opened the door. The flames rushed in and rose up to the beams whose chinks were stuffed with dry moss. My father fired the pistol, stepped over the burning threshold and shouted: “Follow me!” I took my mother and Marya Ivanovna by the hands and quickly led them out. Shvabrin, shot through by my father’s feeble hand, was lying by the threshold. The crowd of brigands who had rushed away at our sudden sally took courage and began closing in upon us. I succeeded in dealing a few more blows; but a well-aimed brick hit me right on the chest. I fell down and lost consciousness for a few moments; I was surrounded and disarmed. Coming to myself I saw Shvabrin sitting on the bloodstained grass, with all our family standing before him. I was supported under the arms. A crowd of peasants, Cossacks, and Bashkirs hemmed us in. Shvabrin was terribly pale. He was pressing one hand to his wounded side. His face expressed malice and pain. He slowly raised his head, glanced at me and said, in a weak, hardly audible voice: “Hang him … and all of them … except her.”"
"Тут Савельич сплеснул руками с видом изумления неописанного. «Жениться!» — повторил он. — «Дитя хочет жениться! А что скажет батюшка, а матушка-то, что подумает?»","Here Savelich clasped his hands with an air of indescribable astonishment. ""Marry!"" he repeated. “The child wants to get married! And what will the father say, and mother, what will she think?",Savelich threw up his hands in astonishment. “Marry her!” he repeated. “The child wants to marry! But what will your dear father say? What will your dear mother think?”,Savelyich clasped his hands with an air of indescribable amazement. “To marry!” he replied. “The child thinks of marrying! But what will your father say; what will your mother think?”
"— И, матушка! — отвечал Иван Игнатьич. — Бог милостив: солдат у нас довольно, пороху много, пушку я вычистил. Авось дадим отпор Пугачеву. Господь не выдаст, свинья не съест!","- And, mother! answered Ivan Ignatitch. - God is merciful: we have enough soldiers, a lot of gunpowder, I cleaned out the cannon. Perhaps we will rebuff Pugachev. The Lord will not give out, the pig will not eat!","“Don’t be afraid, Madam!” replied Ivan Ignatich. “God is merciful. We have soldiers enough, plenty of powder, and I’ve cleaned out the cannon. Maybe we’ll be able to send Pugachov on his way. Whom the Lord helps no man can harm.”","“Don’t you worry, madam,” Ivan Ignatyich answered; “God willing, all will be well. We have soldiers enough, plenty of gunpowder, and I have cleaned the cannon. We may yet keep Pugachov at bay. Whom God helps, nobody can harm.”"
Отец глядел на меня молча — не смея верить самому себе. Радость блистала на лице его. Я спешил саблею разрезать узлы их веревок.,"My father looked at me silently, not daring to believe himself. Joy shone on his face. I hastened to cut the knots of their ropes with my saber.","Father looked at me in silence, not daring to believe his own eyes. His face shone with joy. I drew my sword and cut through the knots in their ropes.","My father looked at me in silence, not daring to believe his senses. His face lit up with joy. “Welcome, Petrusha,” he said, pressing me to his heart."
"— Потому, — отвечал он, — что такие стихи достойны учителя моего, Василья Кирилыча Тредьяковского, и очень напоминают мне его любовные куплетцы.","“Because,” he answered, “such verses are worthy of my teacher, Vasily Kirilych Tredyakovsky, and very much remind me of his love couplets.","“Because lines like that could have been written by my teacher, Vasily Kirillich Tredyakovsky.[4] They strongly remind me of his love poems.”","“Because such lines are worthy of my teacher, Vassily Kirilych Tretyakovsky,§ and greatly remind me of his love verses.”"
"Никто не встретил меня. Я пошел в сени и отворил дверь в переднюю. Старый инвалид, сидя на столе, нашивал синюю заплату на локоть зеленого мундира. Я велел ему доложить обо мне. «Войди, батюшка», — отвечал инвалид: — «наши дома». Я вошел в чистенькую комнатку, убранную по-старинному. В углу стоял шкаф с посудой; на стене висел диплом офицерский за стеклом и в рамке; около него красовались лубочные картинки, представляющие взятие Кистрина и Очакова, также выбор невесты и погребение кота. У окна сидела старушка в телогрейке и с платком на голове. Она разматывала нитки, которые держал, распялив на руках, кривой старичок в офицерском мундире. «Что вам угодно, батюшка?» — спросила она, продолжая свое занятие. Я отвечал, что приехал на службу и явился по долгу своему к господину капитану, и с этим словом обратился, было, к кривому старичку, принимая его за коменданта; но хозяйка перебила затверженную мною речь. «Ивана Кузмича дома нет» — сказала она; — «он пошел в гости к отцу Герасиму; да все равно, батюшка, я его хозяйка. Прошу любить и жаловать. Садись, батюшка». Она кликнула девку и велела ей позвать урядника. Старичок своим одиноким глазом поглядывал на меня с любопытством. «Смею спросить» — сказал он; — «вы в каком полку изволили служить?» Я удовлетворил его любопытству. «А смею спросить» — продолжал он, — «зачем изволили вы перейти из гвардии в гарнизон?» — Я отвечал, что такова была воля начальства. «Чаятельно, за неприличные гвардии офицеру поступки» — продолжал неутомимый вопрошатель. — «Полно врать пустяки» — сказала ему капитанша: — «ты видишь, молодой человек с дороги устал; ему не до тебя… (держи-ка руки прямее…) А ты, мой батюшка», — продолжала она, обращаясь ко мне — «не печалься, что тебя упекли в наше захолустье. Не ты первый, не ты последний. Стерпится, слюбится. Швабрин Алексей Иваныч вот уж пятый год как к нам переведен за смертоубийство. Бог знает, какой грех его попутал; он, изволишь видеть, поехал за город с одним поручиком, да взяли с собою шпаги, да и ну друг в друга пырять; а Алексей Иваныч и заколол поручика, да еще при двух свидетелях! Что прикажешь делать? На грех мастера нет».","Nobody met me. I went into the hallway and opened the front door. An old invalid, sitting on a table, was sewing a blue patch on the elbow of his green uniform. I told him to report me. “Come in, father,” answered the invalid: “our houses.” I entered a clean room, decorated in the old fashioned way. In the corner stood a cupboard with dishes; on the wall hung an officer's diploma behind glass and in a frame; next to it were popular prints representing the capture of Kistrin and Ochakov, as well as the choice of a bride and the burial of a cat. At the window sat an old woman in a padded jacket and with a scarf on her head. She was unwinding the threads, which she held, uncrossed on her hands, a crooked old man in an officer's uniform. ""What do you want, father?"" she asked, continuing her work. I answered that I had come to the service and appeared on my duty to the captain, and with this word I turned to the crooked old man, mistaking him for the commandant; but the hostess interrupted my hardened speech. ""Ivan Kuzmich is not at home,"" she said; - “he went to visit Father Gerasim; it doesn't matter, father, I'm his mistress. Please love and respect. Sit down, father."" She called the girl and told her to call the constable. The old man looked at me with his lonely eye with curiosity. ""I dare to ask,"" he said; - ""In which regiment did you deign to serve?"" I satisfied his curiosity. “But I dare to ask,” he continued, “why did you deign to transfer from the guard to the garrison?” - I answered that such was the will of the authorities. “Really, for the indecent actions of an officer of the guard,” continued the indefatigable questioner. - “It’s full of lying trifles,” the captain said to him: “you see, the young man is tired from the road; he is not up to you ... (keep your arms straighter ...) And you, my father, ”she continued, turning to me,“ do not be sad that you have been put into our backwoods. You are not the first, you are not the last. Endure, fall in love. Shvabrin Aleksei Ivanovich has been transferred to us for the fifth year for murder. God knows what sin beguiled him; he, if you please, went out of town with one lieutenant, and they took swords with them, and, well, they stab each other; and Alexey Ivanovich stabbed the lieutenant to death, and even with two witnesses! What are you supposed to do? There is no master for sin.""","No one came out to meet me. I went inside, then opened the door to the anteroom. An old soldier was sitting cross-legged on a table, sewing a blue patch onto the elbow of a green uniform. I told him to announce my arrival. “Our folk are at home,” he replied. “Go on in, sir.” I went into a clean little room, furnished in an old-fashioned style. In one corner stood a crockery cupboard; on the wall hung an officer’s commission, framed and glazed; beside it were some popular wood-cuts, depicting in bright colors “The Capture of Küstrin” and “The Capture of Ochakov”[4] as well as “Choosing a Bride” and “The Cat’s Funeral. ”[5] An old woman in a quilted jerkin and with a scarf over her head was sitting by the window. She was winding some yarn that a one-eyed old man in an officer’s uniform held stretched between his hands. “What can we do for you, dear sir?” she asked, continuing with her work. I replied that I had been posted to the fortress and wished to report to the commandant. Taking the one-eyed man for the commandant, I was about to begin the speech I had prepared when the mistress of the house said, “Ivan Kuzmich is out. He’s gone to visit Father Gerasim, but never mind, dear sir, I am his wife and you are most welcome. Please sit down.” She called a maid and asked her to fetch the sergeant. The old man kept looking at me inquisitively with his one eye. “May I be so bold,” he said, “as to ask in which regiment it was your pleasure to serve?” I satisfied his curiosity. “And may I also ask,” he went on, “why it was your pleasure to be transferred from the Guards to a fortress garrison?” I replied that this had been the wish of my superiors. “For conduct unbecoming an officer of the Guards, I assume?” my interrogator continued. “That’s enough of your chatter,” said the captain’s wife. “You can see the young man’s tired from his journey; let him be. And keep your hands straight! And you, sir,” she said, turning to me, “don’t grieve that you’ve been packed off to this far-flung corner of ours. You’re not the first and you won’t be the last. And who knows—you might even grow to like it! Alexey Ivanovich Shvabrin has been with us nearly five years now; he was sent here for manslaughter. Heaven knows what possessed him. He rode out of town, you see, with some lieutenant or other. They ’d both brought their swords along and they started jabbing away at each other—and Alexey Ivanovich went and ran the lieutenant through in the presence of two witnesses. Well, there you are —we’re none of us free from sin.”","No one came out to meet me. I walked into the entry and opened the door into the anteroom. An old soldier was sitting on the table, sewing a blue patch on the sleeve of a green uniform. I asked him to announce me. “Go in, my dear,” he said, “our people are at home.” I stepped into a clean little room, furnished in the old-fashioned style. In the corner stood a cupboard full of crockery; an officer’s diploma in a frame under glass hung on the wall; colored prints, representing “The Taking of Ochakoff and Küstrin,” “The Choosing of a Bride,” and “The Cat’s Funeral,” made bright patches on each side of it. An elderly lady, dressed in a Russian jacket† and with a kerchief on her head, was sitting by the window. She was winding yarn which a one-eyed man in an officer’s uniform held for her on his outstretched hands. “What is your pleasure, sir?” she asked me, going on with her work. I answered that I had come to serve in the army, and thought it my duty to present myself to the Captain, and with these words I turned to the one-eyed old man whom I took to be the Commandant, but the lady of the house interrupted the speech I had prepared. “Ivan Kuzmich is not at home,” she answered; “he has gone to see Father Gerasim; but it makes no difference, sir; I am his wife. You are very welcome. Please sit down.” She called the maid and asked her to call the sergeant. The old man kept looking at me inquisitively with his single eye. “May I be so bold as to ask in what regiment you have been serving?” I satisfied his curiosity. “And may I ask,” he continued, “why you have been transferred from the Guards to the garrison?” I answered that such was the decision of my superiors. “I presume it was for behavior unseemly in an officer of the Guards?” the persistent old man went on. “That’s enough nonsense,” the Captain’s lady interrupted him. “You see the young man is tired after the journey; he has other things to think of…. Hold your hands straight. “And don’t you worry, my dear, that you have been banished to these wilds,” she went on, addressing herself to me. “You are not the first nor the last. You will like it better when you are used to it. Shvabrin, Alexey Ivanych, was transferred to us five years ago for killing a man. Heaven only knows what possessed him, but, would you believe it, he went out of town with a certain lieutenant and they both took swords and started prodding each other—and Alexey Ivanych did for the lieutenant, and before two witnesses, too! There it is—one never knows what one may do.”"
"«С дамою! Где же ты ее подцепил? Эге, брат!» (При сих словах Зурин засвистел так выразительно, что все захохотали, а я совершенно смутился).","""With a lady! Where did you pick her up? Ege, brother! (At these words, Zurin whistled so expressively that everyone laughed, and I was completely embarrassed).","a lady.” “A lady! Where did you pick her up?

Oho, brother!” At these words, Zurin whistled so expressively that everyone laughed. I was utterly confused."
"Савельич поглядел на меня с глубокой горестью и пошел за моим долгом. Мне было жаль бедного старика; но я хотел вырваться на волю и доказать, что уж я не ребенок. Деньги были доставлены Зурину. Савельич поспешил вывезти меня из проклятого трактира. Он явился с известием, что лошади готовы.

I felt sorry for the poor old man; but I wanted to break free and prove that I was no longer a child. The money was delivered to Zurin. Savelich hurried to take me out of the accursed tavern.

"«Что ты это, сударь?» — прервал меня Савельич. — «Чтоб я тебя пустил одного! Да этого и во сне не проси. Коли ты уж решился ехать, то я хоть пешком да пойду за тобой, а тебя не покину. Чтоб я стал без тебя сидеть за каменной стеною? Да разве я с ума сошел? Воля твоя, сударь, а я от тебя не отстану».","""What are you, sir?"" Savelich interrupted me. - ""So that I let you alone! Yes, and do not ask for this in a dream. If you have already decided to go, then I will follow you even on foot, but I will not leave you. So that I can sit behind a stone wall without you? Have I gone crazy? Your will, sir, but I will not leave you behind.","“What do you mean, sir?” Savelich interrupted. “Do you think I’m going to let you go on your own? Not for one moment! If you’re set on going, then I’m coming too. Even if I have to walk all the way, I shan’t desert you. How could I sit here on my own, sheltering behind a stone wall?

I haven’t taken leave of my senses yet. Say what you like, sir, but I will go with you.”"
"Марья Ивановна мучилась более всех. Будучи уверена, что я мог оправдаться, когда бы только захотел, она догадывалась об истине и почитала себя виновницею моего несчастия. Она скрывала от всех свои слезы и страдания, и между тем непрестанно думала о средствах, как бы меня спасти.","Marya Ivanovna suffered the most.

"Марья Ивановна приняла письмо дрожащею рукою и, заплакав, упала к ногам императрицы, которая подняла ее и поцаловала. Государыня разговорилась с нею. «Знаю, что вы не богаты» — сказала она, — «но я в долгу перед дочерью капитана Миронова. Не беспокойтесь о будущем. Я беру на себя устроить ваше состояние».","Marya Ivanovna accepted the letter with a trembling hand and, crying, fell at the feet of the empress, who raised her and kissed her.

"Мы расстались дружески. Пугачев, увидя в толпе Акулину Памфиловну, погрозил пальцем и мигнул значительно; потом сел в кибитку, велел ехать в Берду, и когда лошади тронулись, то он еще раз высунулся из кибитки и закричал мне: «Прощай, ваше благородие!

"Вместо ответа я схватил его за ворот и, притащив к дверям анбара, велел их отпирать. Земский, было, заупрямился, но отеческое наказание подействовало и на него. Он вынул ключ и отпер анбар. Я кинулся через порог и в темном углу, слабо освещенном узким отверстием, прорубленным в потолке, увидел мать и отца. Руки их были связаны — на ноги набиты были колодки. Я бросился их обнимать и не мог выговорить ни слова. Оба смотрел на меня с изумлением — 3 года военной жизни так изменили меня, что они не могли меня узнать. Матушка ахнула и залилась слезами.","Instead of answering, I grabbed him by the collar and, dragging him to the doors of the anbar, ordered them to be unlocked.

I rushed to hug them and could not utter a word. Both looked at me in amazement - 3 years of military life had changed me so much that they could not recognize me. Mother gasped and burst into tears.","By way of a reply I seized him by the collar, dragged him to the granary door and told him to open it.

I rushed forward to embrace them and found myself at a loss for words. They both gazed at me in astonishment; three years of army life had changed me beyond recognition. Mother gasped and burst into tears.","By way of an answer, I seized him by the collar and, dragging him to the granary doors, told him to open them.

ГЛАВА XIV. СУД,CHAPTER XIV. COURT,14. THE TRIBUNAL,XIV THE TRIAL
"«Вот я вас!» — закричал Иван Кузмич. — «Ребята! стреляй!» Солдаты наши дали залп. Казак, державший письмо, зашатался и свалился с лошади; другие поскакали назад. Я взглянул на Марью Ивановну. Пораженная видом окровавленной головы Юлая, оглушенная залпом, она казалась без памяти. Комендант подозвал капрала и велел ему взять лист из рук убитого казака. Капрал вышел в поле и возвратился, ведя под устцы лошадь убитого. Он вручил коменданту письмо. Иван Кузмич прочел его про себя и разорвал потом в клочки. Между тем мятежники видимо приготовлялись к действию. Вскоре пули начали свистать около наших ушей, и несколько стрел воткнулись около нас в землю и в частокол. «Василиса Егоровна!» — сказал комендант. — «Здесь не бабье дело; уведи Машу; видишь: девка ни жива, ни мертва».","""Here I am!"" shouted Ivan Kuzmich. - ""Guys! shoot!"" Our soldiers fired a volley. The Cossack holding the letter staggered and fell off his horse; others jumped back. I glanced at Marya Ivanovna. Struck by the sight of Yulai's bloodied head, stunned by the volley, she seemed to be unconscious. The commandant called the corporal and ordered him to take the sheet from the hands of the murdered Cossack. The corporal went out into the field and returned, leading the dead man's horse under the mouth. He handed the commandant a letter. Ivan Kuzmich read it to himself and then tore it to shreds. Meanwhile, the rebels apparently prepared for action. Soon the bullets began to whistle near our ears, and several arrows stuck near us into the ground and into the stockade. ""Vasilisa Yegorovna!"" the commandant said. - “This is not a woman's business; take Masha away; you see: the girl is neither alive nor dead.","“Here’s how I greet your Tsar!” shouted Ivan Kuzmich. “Come on, lads, fire!” Our soldiers fired a volley. The Cossack with the sheet of paper swayed and fell from his horse; the others galloped back. I looked at Maria Ivanovna. Deafened by the volley and appalled by the sight of Yulay’s bloody head, she looked dazed. Ivan Kuzmich ordered a corporal to go and collect the paper from the hand of the dead Cossack. The corporal went out into the steppe and came back again, leading the Cossack’s horse by the bridle. He gave the letter to Ivan Kuzmich. Ivan Kuzmich read it, then tore it into shreds. Meanwhile the rebels were preparing for action. It was not long before bullets were whistling past our ears and arrows landing nearby, sticking into the ground and the palisade. “Vasilisa Yegorovna!” said Ivan Kuzmich. “This is no place for women. Take Masha away. The girl looks half dead with fear.”","“I’ll give it to you!” Ivan Kuzmich shouted. “Shoot, lads!” Our soldiers fired a volley. The Cossack who held the letter reeled and fell off his horse; others galloped away. I glanced at Marya Ivanovna. Horrified by the sight of Yulay’s bloodstained head and stunned by the volley, she seemed dazed. The Commandant called the corporal and told him to take the paper out of the dead Cossack’s hands. The corporal went out into the field and returned leading the dead man’s horse by the bridle. He handed the letter to the Commandant. Ivan Kuzmich read it to himself and then tore it to bits. Meanwhile the rebels were evidently making ready for action. In a few minutes bullets whizzed in our ears, and a few arrows stuck into the ground and the palisade near us. “Vasilisa Yegorovna,” said the Commandant, “this is no place for women, take Masha home; you see the girl is more dead than alive.”"
"— Куда приехали? — спросил я, протирая глаза.","— Where did you come? I asked, rubbing my eyes.","“Arrived where?” I asked, rubbing my eyes.","“Where?” I asked, rubbing my eyes."
— Что ж за беда!,— What a trouble!,Look—it’s blowing up the loose snow.”,“But what of it?”
"«Нет, Василиса Егоровна», — продолжал комендант, замечая, что слова его подействовали, может быть, в первый раз в его жизни. — «Маше здесь оставаться не гоже. Отправим ее в Оренбург к ее крестной матери: там и войска и пушек довольно, и стена каменная. Да и тебе советовал бы с нею туда же отправиться; даром, что ты старуха, а посмотри что с тобою будет, коли возьмут фортецию приступом».","“No, Vasilisa Yegorovna,” continued the commandant, noticing that his words had an effect, perhaps for the first time in his life. “Masha is not fit to stay here. We will send her to Orenburg to her godmother: there are enough troops and cannons, and a stone wall. Yes, and I would advise you to go with her there too; for nothing that you are an old woman, but look what will happen to you if they take the fort by attack.","“No, Vasilisa Yegorovna,” Ivan Kuzmich went on, realizing that, perhaps for the first time ever, his words were having some effect. “It won’t do for Masha to stay here. Let’s send her to her godmother in Orenburg. They have artillery there, and plenty of soldiers, and stone walls. And I advise you to go with her. You may not be young, but that’ll make no difference if they storm the fortress.”","“No, Vasilisa Yegorovna,” the Commandant continued, noting that his words had produced an effect perhaps for the first time in his life, “it is not fit for Masha to stay here. Let us send her to Orenburg, to her godmother ’s: there are plenty of soldiers there, and enough artillery and a stone wall. And I would advise you to go with her: you may be an old woman, but you’ll see what they’ll do to you, if they take the fortress.”"
"«Каков мошенник!» — воскликнула комендантша. — «Что смеет еще нам предлагать! Выдти к нему на встречу и положить к ногам его знамена! Ах, он собачий сын! Да разве не знает он, что мы уже сорок лет в службе и всего, слава богу, насмотрелись? Неужто нашлись такие командиры, которые послушались разбойника?»","""What a swindler!"" exclaimed the commandant. “What else does he dare to offer us! Go out to meet him and put banners at his feet! Oh, he's a dog's son! But doesn’t he know that we have been in the service for forty years and, thank God, have seen enough of everything? Are there really such commanders who obeyed the robber?","“The scoundrel!” exclaimed Vasilisa Yegorovna. “How dare he speak like that? We are to go out to meet him—and then lay our flags and banners at his feet? Son of a dog! Does he not realize that we have seen a thing or two, by the grace of God, during the forty years that we’ve served? There haven’t been any officers anywhere who’ve listened to the brigand, have there?”","“The rascal!” cried Vasilisa Yegorovna. “To think of his daring to make us such offers! We are to go and meet him and lay the banners at his feet! Ah, the dog! Doesn’t he know that we’ve been forty years in the army and have seen a thing or two? Surely no commanders have listened to the brigand?”"
"Хозяйка побранила ее за раннюю осеннюю прогулку, вредную, по ее словам, для здоровья молодой девушки. Она принесла самовар, и за чашкою чая только было принялась за бесконечные рассказы о дворе, как вдруг придворная карета остановилась у крыльца, и камер-лакей вошел с объявлением, что государыня изволит к себе приглашать девицу Миронову. Анна Власьевна изумилась и расхлопоталась. «Ахти, господи!» — закричала она. — «Государыня требует вас ко двору. Как же это она про вас узнала? Да как же вы, матушка, представитесь к императрице? Вы, я чай, и ступить по придворному не умеете… Не проводить ли мне вас? все-таки я вас хоть в чем-нибудь да могу предостеречь. И как же вам ехать в дорожном платье? Не послать ли к повивальной бабушке за ее желтым роброном?» — Камер-лакей объявил, что государыне угодно было, чтоб Марья Ивановна ехала одна, и в том, в чем ее застанут. Делать было нечего: Марья Ивановна села в карету и поехала во дворец, сопровождаемая советами и благословениями Анны Власьевны.","The hostess scolded her for taking an early autumn walk, which, she said, was harmful to the health of a young girl. She brought a samovar, and over a cup of tea she had just begun to endless stories about the court, when suddenly the court carriage stopped at the porch, and the footman entered with an announcement that the empress would deign to invite the maiden Mironova to her. Anna Vlasyevna was amazed and got busy. ""Oh, my God!"" she screamed. “The empress demands you to the court. How did she know about you? But how can you, mother, introduce yourself to the Empress? You, I’m tea, and you don’t know how to step on the court ... Shall I see you off? Still, I can at least warn you about something. And how do you ride in a road dress? Should I send to the midwife for her yellow robron?” - The footman announced that the Empress wanted Marya Ivanovna to go alone, and in what she would be found in. There was nothing to do: Marya Ivanovna got into the carriage and went to the palace, accompanied by the advice and blessings of Anna Vlasyevna.","Anna Vlasyevna upbraided her for going out so early; the autumn air, she said, was injurious to a young woman’s health. She brought in the samovar and was about to embark, over a cup of tea, on more of her interminable stories of Court life when a royal carriage stopped outside and a footman came in to announce that Her Majesty was pleased to request the presence of Captain Mironov’s young daughter. Anna Vlasyevna was all wonder and bustle. “Gracious me!” she cried. “Her Majesty—Her Majesty requires you at Court. But how on earth does she know of you? And how can a girl like you, my dear, appear before Her Majesty? I’ll warrant you know next to nothing about Court manners. Hadn’t I better go with you? I could at least warn you about one or two things. And how can you go in your travelling dress? Hadn’t I better send to the midwife for her yellow gown with the hooped skirt?” The footman declared that it was Her Majesty’s pleasure that Maria Ivanovna should go alone and in the clothes she was wearing. There was nothing for it; Maria Ivanovna took her seat in the carriage and set out for the Palace, to the accompaniment of Anna Vlasyevna’s admonitions and blessings.","Her landlady chided her for her early walk which, she said, was not good for a young girl’s health, as it was autumn. She brought the samovar and just began, over a cup of tea, her endless stories about the Court, when suddenly a Court carriage stopped at the door and a footman from the Palace came into the room, saying that the Empress invited Miss Mironov to her presence. Anna Vlasyevna was surprised and flurried. “Dear me!” she cried. “The Empress sends for you to come to the Palace! How has she heard of you? And how are you going to appear before the Empress, my dear? I expect you know nothing about Court manners … Hadn’t I better go with you? I could warn you about some things, at any rate. And how can you go in your traveling dress?

There was nothing else for it; Marya Ivanovna stepped into the carriage and drove to the Palace accompanied by Anna Vlasyevna’s admonitions and blessings."
"— Изволь; когда хочешь! — отвечал я, обрадовавшись. В эту минуту я готов был растерзать его.","- Please; when you want to! I answered, overjoyed. At that moment I was ready to tear him to pieces.",Whenever you wish!” I replied. I was delighted; at that moment I could have torn him limb from limb.,"“Certainly—whenever you like,” I answered, with relief. I was ready to tear him to pieces at that moment."
— Не могу: я не один.,"I can't, I'm not alone.",“I can’t. I’m not alone.”,“I cannot; I am not alone.”
"Неожиданная весть сильно меня поразила. Комендант Нижнеозерной крепости, тихий и скромный молодой человек, был мне знаком: месяца за два перед тем проезжал он из Оренбурга с молодой своей женою и останавливался у Ивана Кузмича. Нижнеозерная находилась от нашей крепости верстах в двадцати пяти. С часу на час должно было и нам ожидать нападения Пугачева. Участь Марьи Ивановны живо представилась мне, и сердце у меня так и замерло.","The unexpected news shocked me greatly. The commandant of the Lower Lake Fortress, a quiet and modest young man, was familiar to me: two months before that, he had traveled from Orenburg with his young wife and stayed with Ivan Kuzmich. Nizhneozernaya was twenty-five versts from our fortress. From hour to hour we should have expected an attack by Pugachev. The fate of Marya Ivanovna vividly presented itself to me, and my heart sank.","This news shocked me deeply. I had met the fortress commandant, a quiet and modest young man. Only a couple of months ago, he and his young wife had passed through on their way from Orenburg; they had stayed with Ivan Kuzmich. Lower Lake was about sixteen miles from Belogorsk. Pugachov might attack at any moment. I could imagine only too clearly what would happen to Maria Ivanovna; there was ice in my heart.","The unexpected news was a great shock to me. I knew the Commandant of the Nizhneozerny fortress, a modest and quiet young man; some two months before he had put up at Ivan Kuzmich’s on his way from Orenburg with his young wife.

«Благополучно?» — повторил Пугачев. — «А народ мрет с голоду!»,"""Safely?"" Pugachev repeated. “And the people are dying of hunger!”",Pugachov repeated. “With the inhabitants dying of hunger?”,Pugachov repeated. “And people are dying of starvation?”
"Иван Кузмич не знал, на что решиться. Марья Ивановна была чрезвычайно бледна. Мало-помалу буря утихла; комендантша успокоилась, и заставила нас друг друга поцаловать. Палашка принесла нам наши шпаги. Мы вышли от коменданта, по-видимому, примиренные. Иван Игнатьич нас сопровождал. — Как вам не стыдно было — сказал я ему сердито — доносить на нас коменданту после того, как дали мне слово того не делать? — «Как бог свят, я Ивану Кузмичу того не говорил» — отвечал он; — «Василиса Егоровна выведала все от меня. Она всем и распорядилась без ведома коменданта. Впрочем, слава богу, что все так кончилось». С этим словом он повернул домой, а Швабрин и я остались наедине. — Наше дело этим кончиться не может — сказал я ему. «Конечно», — отвечал Швабрин; — «вы своею кровью будете отвечать мне за вашу дерзость; но за нами, вероятно, станут присматривать. Несколько дней нам должно будет притворяться. До свидания!» — И мы расстались, как ни в чем не бывали.","Ivan Kuzmich did not know what to decide. Marya Ivanovna was extremely pale. Little by little the storm subsided; The commandant calmed down and made us kiss each other. Palashka brought us our swords. We left the commandant's, apparently reconciled.

""Aren't you ashamed,"" I told him angrily, ""to denounce us to the commandant after you gave me your word not to do it?"" “Holy as God, I didn’t tell Ivan Kuzmich,” he answered; “Vasilisa Yegorovna found out everything from me.

She arranged everything without Ivan Kuzmich knowing a thing.

"Темнота приближающейся ночи могла избавить меня от всякой опасности, как вдруг, оглянувшись, увидел я, что Савельича со мною не было. Бедный старик на своей хромой лошади не мог ускакать от разбойников. Что было делать? Подождав его несколько минут, и удостоверясь в том, что он задержан, я поворотил лошадь и отправился его выручать.","The darkness of the approaching night could have saved me from all danger, when suddenly, looking around, I saw that Savelich was not with me.

"— Неправда, ей богу, неправда! Я знаю все, я все вам расскажу. Он для одной меня подвергался всему, что постигло его.

"Но намерение мое было твердо принято. — Поздно рассуждать, — отвечал я старику. — Я должен ехать, я не могу не ехать. Не тужи, Савельич: бог милостив; авось увидимся! Смотри же, не совестись и не скупись. Покупай, что тебе будет нужно, хоть втридорога. Деньги эти я тебе дарю. Если через три дня я не ворочусь…","But my intention was firmly accepted.

I asked, holding back my indignation with difficulty.",“And what makes you think that?” I asked. I could hardly restrain myself; my blood was boiling.,"My blood boiled. “And why have you such an opinion of her?” I asked, hardly able to restrain my indignation."

"Зря меня в сей лютой части,","In vain me in this fierce part,",Or forever must I languish,You can see my cruel torments:
"Я откланялся. Урядник привел меня в избу, стоявшую на высоком берегу реки, на самом краю крепости. Половина избы занята была семьею Семена Кузова, другую отвели мне. Она состояла из одной горницы довольно опрятной, разделенной надвое перегородкой. Савельич стал в ней распоряжаться; я стал глядеть в узенькое окошко. Передо мною простиралась печальная степь. Наискось стояло несколько избушек; по улице бродило несколько куриц старуха, стоя на крыльце с корытом, кликала свиней, которые отвечали ей дружелюбным хрюканьем. И вот в какой стороне осужден я был проводить мою молодость! Тоска взяла меня; я отошел от окошка и лег спать без ужина, несмотря на увещания Савельича, который повторял с сокрушением: «Господи владыко! ничего кушать не изволит! Что скажет барыня, коли дитя занеможет?»","I bowed out. The constable led me to a hut that stood on the high bank of the river, on the very edge of the fortress. Half of the hut was occupied by the family of Semyon Kuzov, the other was taken to me. It consisted of one room, a fairly neat room, divided in two by a partition. Savelich began to dispose of it; I began to look out the narrow window. Before me stretched the sad steppe. Several huts stood obliquely; several hens wandered along the street, the old woman, standing on the porch with a trough, called the pigs, who answered her with friendly grunts. And this is the direction in which I was condemned to spend my youth! Longing took me; I moved away from the window and went to bed without supper, despite the exhortations of Savelich, who repeated with contrition: “Lord, Vladyka! nothing to eat! What will the lady say if the child becomes ill?","I took my leave. The sergeant led me to a hut high on the riverbank, at the very edge of the village. The hut was tidy and consisted of one room, divided by a partition. Semyon Kuzov and his family occupied one half; the other was allotted to me.

An old woman was standing by her front door, holding a tub and calling to her pigs, which were grunting affably in reply. And this was where I was condemned to spend my youth! I was overcome by melancholy. I turned from the window and went to bed without any supper, despite the entreaties of Savelich, who kept repeating in tones of deep distress, “Lord Almighty! He’s refusing to eat! What will the mistress say if the child’s taken ill?”","I took leave of her. The Cossack brought me to a cottage that stood on the high bank of the river at the very edge of the fortress. Half of the cottage was occupied by Semyon Kuzov’s family, the other was allotted to me.

On one side I could see a few cottages; several hens strutted about the street. An old woman stood on the steps with a trough, calling to pigs that answered her with friendly grunting.

"— Не бойтесь, — сказал я женщинам, — есть надежда. А вы, батюшка, уже более не стреляйте. Побережем последний заряд.","“Don't be afraid,” I said to the women, “there is hope.

"Однако зайчий тулуп явился. Мужичок тут же стал его примеривать. В самом деле, тулуп, из которого успел и я вырости, был немножко для него узок. Однако он кое-как умудрился, и надел его, распоров по швам. Савельич чуть не завыл, услышав, как нитки затрещали. Бродяга был чрезвычайно доволен моим подарком.

Да где же Маша?» — Тут вошла девушка лет осьмнадцати, круглолицая, румяная, с светлорусыми волосами, гладко зачесанными за уши, которые у ней так и горели.

Not seeing her husband, Vasilisa Yegorovna sent Palasha a second time to call him. “Tell your master that our guests are waiting and the soup will get cold; there is always time for drilling, thank heaven; he can shout to his heart’s content later on.” The Captain soon appeared, accompanied by the one-eyed old man. “What has come over you, my dear?” his wife said to him. “Dinner was served ages ago, and you wouldn’t come.” “But I was busy drilling soldiers, Vasilisa Yegorovna, let me tell you.”"
"Наконец однажды утром Савельич вошел ко мне, держа в руках письмо. Я схватил его с трепетом. Адрес был написан рукою батюшки. Это приуготовило меня к чему-то важному, ибо обыкновенно письма писала ко мне матушка, а он в конце приписывал несколько строк. Долго не распечатывал я пакета и перечитывал торжественную надпись: «Сыну моему Петру Андреевичу Гриневу, в Оренбургскую губернию, в Белогорскую крепость». Я старался по почерку угадать расположение духа, в котором писано было письмо; наконец решился его распечатать, и с первых строк увидел, что все дело пошло к чорту. Содержание письма было следующее:","Finally, one morning, Savelich came to me, holding a letter in his hands. I grabbed it with trepidation. The address was written by the father's hand. This prepared me for something important, for my mother usually wrote letters to me, and he added a few lines at the end. I did not open the package for a long time and re-read the solemn inscription: ""To my son Pyotr Andreevich Grinev, to the Orenburg province, to the Belogorsk fortress."" I tried to guess from the handwriting the mood in which the letter was written; finally he decided to print it out, and from the first lines he saw that the whole thing had gone to hell. The content of the letter was as follows:","One morning, Savelich finally came in with a letter in his hand. My heart racing, I snatched it from him. The address was in Father’s hand. This prepared me for something important; it was usually Mother who wrote to me, with Father merely adding a few lines at the end. For some time, leaving the seal unbroken, I read and reread the solemn and formal inscription: To my son, Pyotr Andreich Grinyov, at Fort Belogorsk in the Province of Orenburg. I tried to divine from the handwriting the mood in which the letter had been written. At last I braced myself to open it. It was clear from the first lines that all was lost. Here is what Father wrote:","At last, one morning Savelyich came in to me holding a letter. I seized it with a tremor. The address was written in my father’s hand. This prepared me for something important, for as a rule it was my mother who wrote to me and my father only added a few lines at the end of the letter. Several minutes passed before I unsealed the envelope, reading over again and again the solemnly worded address: “To my son Pyotr Andreyich Grinyov, at the Belogorsky fortress in the Province of Orenburg.” I tried to guess from the handwriting in what mood my father wrote the letter; at last I brought myself to open it and saw from the very first lines that all was lost. The letter was as follows:"
"Не гневайтесь, сударь: по долгу моему","Do not be angry, sir: according to my duty","“Duty, dear sir, requires that I compel","“Do not be angry, sir; my duty bids me"
"«Видно он, в самом деле, силен», — заметил Швабрин.","“It can be seen that he is, in fact, strong,” Shvabrin remarked.","“He does indeed seem to be strong,” said Shvabrin.","“He must really be strong, then,” Shvabrin remarked."
"Этот зайчий тулуп мог, наконец, не на шутку рассердить Пугачева. К счастию, самозванец или не расслыхал или пренебрег неуместным намеком. Лошади поскакали; народ на улице останавливался и кланялся в пояс. Пугачев кивал головою на обе стороны. Через минуту мы выехали из слободы и помчались по гладкой дороге.","This bunny sheepskin coat could finally irritate Pugachev in earnest. Fortunately, the impostor either did not hear or ignored the inappropriate hint. The horses galloped; people on the street stopped and bowed from the waist. Pugachev nodded his head to both sides. A minute later we left the settlement and rushed along a smooth road.","I was afraid that this hare-skin coat might, at last, well and truly enrage Pugachov. Fortunately, he either failed to hear Savelich or else chose to ignore his ill-judged words. The horses galloped off; passersby stopped and bowed low. Pugachov nodded right and left. In less than a minute we had left Berdy and were gliding over smooth snow.",This hareskin jacket might anger Pugachov in earnest at last. Fortunately he had not heard or took no notice of the inopportune remark. The horses set off at a gallop; the people in the street stopped and bowed. Pugachov nodded right and left. A minute later we left the village and flew along the smooth road.

"Я слыхал о тамошних мятелях, и знал, что целые обозы бывали ими занесены. Савельич, согласно со мнением ямщика, советовал воротиться. Но ветер показался мне не силен; я понадеялся добраться заблаговременно до следующей станции, и велел ехать скорее.","I heard about the mutineers there, and I knew that entire wagon trains were carried by them. Savelich, in accordance with the opinion of the coachman, advised to return. But the wind seemed to me not strong; I hoped to get to the next station in advance, and ordered to go faster.","I had heard of the blizzards in these parts, and I knew that they sometimes buried whole caravans of sledges. Savelich, like the driver, advised me to turn back. But the wind did not seem at all strong; trusting we could reach the next post station in good time, I ordered the driver to press on.","I had heard about snowstorms in those parts, and knew that whole transports were sometimes buried by them. Savelyich, like the driver, thought that we ought to turn back. But the wind did not seem to me strong; I hoped to arrive in time at the station, and told the man to drive faster."
"Я дожидался не долго. На другой день, когда сидел я за элегией и грыз перо в ожидании рифмы, Швабрин постучался под моим окошком. Я оставил перо, взял шпагу и к нему вышел. «Зачем откладывать?» — сказал мне Швабрин, — «за нами не смотрят. Сойдем к реке. Там никто нам не помешает». Мы отправились, молча. Спустясь по крутой тропинке, мы остановились у самой реки и обнажили шпаги. Швабрин был искуснее меня, но я сильнее и смелее, и monsieur Бопре, бывший некогда солдатом, дал мне несколько уроков в фехтовании, которыми я и воспользовался. Швабрин не ожидал найти во мне столь опасного противника. Долго мы не могли сделать друг другу никакого вреда; наконец, приметя, что Швабрин ослабевает, я стал с живостию на него наступать и загнал его почти в самую реку. Вдруг услышал я свое имя, громко произнесенное. Я оглянулся, и увидел Савельича, сбегающего ко мне по нагорной тропинке... В это самое время меня сильно кольнуло в грудь пониже правого плеча; я упал и лишился чувств.","I didn't wait long. The next day, when I was sitting at the elegy and nibbling my pen in anticipation of a rhyme, Shvabrin knocked at my window. I left my pen, took my sword and went out to him. ""Why delay?"" Shvabrin told me, “They don’t look after us. Let's go to the river. No one will stop us there."" We set off in silence. Descending a steep path, we stopped at the very edge of the river and drew our swords. Shvabrin was more skilful than I, but I am stronger and bolder, and Monsieur Beaupré, who was once a soldier, gave me several lessons in swordsmanship, which I took advantage of. Shvabrin did not expect to find such a dangerous adversary in me. For a long time we could not do each other any harm; Finally, realizing that Shvabrin was weakening, I began to attack him with vigor and drove him almost into the river itself. Suddenly I heard my name spoken loudly. I looked around and saw Savelich running down the mountain path towards me... At that very moment I was stung violently in the chest below my right shoulder; I fell and fainted.","I did not have to wait long. The next day, as I was composing an elegy, biting my pen in the hope of finding a rhyme, Shvabrin came and tapped on the wall just beneath my window. I put down my pen, took my sword, and went out to join him. “Why wait any longer?” he asked. “We’re not being watched. Let’s go down to the river. No one will interfere with us there.” We set off in silence. After climbing down a steep little path, we stopped by the very edge of the river and drew our swords. Shvabrin was the better swordsman, but I was stronger and bolder and I was able to make good use of the fencing lessons I had once had from Monsieur Beaupré. Shvabrin had clearly not expected me to be such a dangerous opponent. For a long time neither of us was able to inflict any injury upon the other; at last, realizing that Shvabrin was weakening, I began to advance on him energetically and almost drove him into the river. Just then I heard someone calling my name. I looked round and saw Savelich running down the path towards me. At that moment I felt a sharp pain in my chest, just below my right shoulder; I fell to the ground and passed out.","I did not have to wait long. The following day as I sat composing an elegy, biting my pen as I searched for a rhyme, Shvabrin knocked at my window. I left my pen, picked up my sword, and went out to him. “Why wait?” Shvabrin said. “We are not watched. Let us go down to the river. No one will disturb us there.” We walked in silence. Descending by a steep path we stopped at a river bank and bared our swords. Shvabrin was more skilled than I, but I was stronger and more daring; Monsieur Beaupré, who had once been a soldier, had given me a few lessons in fencing and I made use of them. Shvabrin had not expected to find in me so formidable an opponent. For a time we could neither of us do the other any harm; at last, observing that Shvabrin was weakening, I began to press him and almost drove him into the river. Suddenly I heard someone loudly calling my name. I turned round and saw Savelyich running toward me down the steep path … at that moment I felt a stab in my breast under the right shoulder, and fell down senseless."

"С этим словом она встала и вошла в крытую аллею, а. Марья Ивановна возвратилась к Анне Власьевне, исполненная радостной надежды.","With that word, she got up and entered the covered alley, a. Marya Ivanovna returned to Anna Vlasyevna, filled with joyful hope.","”[8] With these words she stood up and went on her way down a covered walk. Maria Ivanovna, full of joyful hope, returned to Anna Vlasyevna’s.","With these words, she rose and went into a covered alley and Marya Ivanovna, full of joyous hope, returned to Anna Vlasyevna’s."
"Я взглянул, и обмер. На полу, в крестьянском оборванном платье сидела Марья Ивановна, бледная, худая, с растрепанными волосами. Перед нею стоял кувшин воды, накрытый ломтем хлеба. Увидя меня, она вздрогнула и закричала. Что тогда со мною стало — не помню.","I looked and froze. On the floor, in a tattered peasant dress, sat Marya Ivanovna, pale, thin, with disheveled hair. In front of her stood a jug of water, covered with a slice of bread. When she saw me, she started and screamed. What happened to me then, I don't remember.","One look and I nearly fainted. Maria Ivanovna—pale, thin, and wild-haired—was sitting on the floor in a torn peasant dress. Before her stood a pitcher of water, with a hunk of bread placed on top of it. Seeing me, she trembled violently and cried out. What that did to me is more than I can say.","I looked—and was aghast. Marya Ivanovna, pale and thin, with disheveled hair and dressed like a peasant, was sitting on the floor; a jug of water, covered with a piece of bread, stood before her.

В назначенный час я уже был у генерала.","I went to the apartment allotted to me, where Savelich was already in charge, and impatiently began to wait for the appointed time.

"Я хватил ее руку и долго не мог вымолвить ни одного слова. Мы оба молчали от полноты сердца. Хозяева наши почувствовали, что нам было не до них, и оставили нас. Мы остались одни, все было забыто. Мы говорили и не могли наговориться. Марья Ивановна рассказала мне все, что с нею ни случилось с самого взятия крепости; описала мне весь ужас ее положения, все испытания, которым подвергал ее гнусный Швабрин. Мы вспомнили и прежнее счастливое время… Оба мы плакали… Наконец я стал объяснять ей мои предположения. Оставаться ей в крепости, подвластной Пугачеву и управляемой Швабриным, было невозможно. Нельзя было думать и об Оренбурге, претерпевающем все бедствия осады. У ней не было на свете ни одного родного человека. Я предложил ей ехать в деревню к моим родителям. Она сначала колебалась: известное ей неблагорасположение отца моего ее пугало. Я ее успокоил. Я знал, что отец почтет за счастие и вменит себе в обязанность принять дочь заслуженного воина, погибшего за отечество. — Милая Марья Ивановна! — сказал я, наконец. — Я почитаю тебя своею женою. Чудные обстоятельства соединили нас неразрывно: ничто на свете не может нас разлучить. — Марья Ивановна выслушала меня просто, без притворной застенчивости, без затейливых отговорок. Она чувствовала, что судьба ее соединена была с моею. Но она повторила, что не иначе будет моею женою, как с согласия моих родителей. Я ей и не противуречил. Мы поцаловались горячо, искренно — и таким образом все было между нами решено.","I grabbed her hand and for a long time could not utter a single word. We were both silent from the fullness of our hearts. Our hosts felt that we had no time for them, and left us. We were alone, everything was forgotten. We talked and couldn't talk. Marya Ivanovna told me everything that had happened to her since the capture of the fortress; she described to me all the horror of her situation, all the trials to which the infamous Shvabrin subjected her. We also remembered the former happy time ... We both cried ... Finally, I began to explain my assumptions to her. It was impossible for her to remain in the fortress, subject to Pugachev and controlled by Shvabrin. It was impossible to think about Orenburg, which was undergoing all the disasters of the siege. She did not have a single person in the world. I invited her to go to the village to my parents. She hesitated at first: my father's well-known disposition frightened her. I calmed her down. I knew that my father would honor it with happiness and make it his duty to accept the daughter of an honored soldier who died for the fatherland. Dear Maria Ivanovna! I said at last. “I honor you as my wife. Miraculous circumstances have united us inextricably: nothing in the world can separate us. Marya Ivanovna listened to me simply, without feigned shyness, without fanciful excuses. She felt that her fate was connected with mine. But she repeated that she would not be my wife otherwise than with the consent of my parents. I didn't oppose her. We kissed passionately, sincerely - and thus everything was decided between us.","I seized her hand and for a long time could not utter a single word. Our hearts were too full for speech. Sensing that they were in the way, our hosts left the room. There was only Maria Ivanovna and I—everything else disappeared. We talked and talked and still could not say all there was to say. Maria Ivanovna told me what had happened to her after the fortress had been taken; she described all the horror of her situation and the ordeals to which she had been subjected by the vile Shvabrin. We also recalled the happy days of the past. We both wept. Eventually I told her my plans. It was, of course, out of the question for her to remain in a fortress subject to Pugachov and under the command of Shvabrin. Neither could I think of taking her to besieged Orenburg. She had not a single relative in the world. I suggested she go and stay with my parents. At first she hesitated, afraid of my father’s hostility. I reassured her. I knew that my father would see it as both a joy and a duty to take in the daughter of an honorable soldier who had given his life for the fatherland. “Darling Maria Ivanovna,” I said. “I look upon you as my wife. Miraculous circumstances have united us. Nothing in the world can separate us.” Maria Ivanovna listened straightforwardly, without the least hint of coyness or feigned protest. She felt that her fate and mine were now one. But she repeated that she would marry me only if my parents agreed. I did not argue with her. We kissed ardently and with true feeling—and so everything was settled between us.","I clasped her hand and for some moments could not utter a word. Our hearts were too full for speech. Our hosts felt that we had no thoughts to spare for them and left us. We were alone. All was forgotten. We talked and talked.

We recalled the bygone happy days…. We were both weeping…. At last I put my plans before her. It was impossible for her to stay in a fortress subject to Pugachov and ruled by Shvabrin. It was no use thinking of Orenburg where the inhabitants were suffering all the horrors of the siege. She had no one belonging to her in the world. I suggested she go to my parents’ estate. She hesitated at first; she knew my father’s animosity toward her and was afraid. I reassured her. I knew that my father would be happy and consider it his duty to welcome the daughter of a veteran who had died for his country. “Darling Marya Ivanovna,” I said to her, at last. “I look upon you as my wife. Miraculous circumstances have united us forever; nothing in the world can part us.” Marya Ivanovna listened to me without coyness or feigned reluctance. She felt that her fate was united to mine. But she repeated that she would only marry me with my parents’ consent. I did not contradict her about it. We kissed each other sincerely and ardently—and all was settled between us."

How will I appear before the eyes of the gentlemen? what will they say, how will they know that the child is drinking and playing.","“Oh, Pyotr Andreich!” he replied with a deep sigh. “Dear master! It’s myself I’m angry with —it’s me who’s to blame. Why did I leave you alone in the inn? The Devil must have been at my elbow.

Whatever are the master and mistress going to think of me now? Whatever are they going to say when they hear that their child’s learned to drink and gamble?”","“Ah, my dear Pyotr Andreyich,” he answered, with a deep sigh, “I am cross with myself—it was all my fault. How could I have left you alone at the inn! There it is—I yielded to temptation: I thought I would call on the deacon’s wife, an old friend of mine. It’s just as the proverb says—you go and see your friends and in jail your visit ends. It is simply dreadful! How shall I show myself before my master and mistress? What will they say when they hear that the child gambles and drinks?”"

"«Слышь, ты, Василиса Егоровна», — сказал он ей, покашливая. — «Отец Герасим получил, говорят, из города…» — Полно врать, Иван Кузмич, — перервала комендантша; ты, знать, хочешь собрать совещание, да без меня потолковать об Емельяне Пугачеве; да лих не проведешь! — Иван Кузмич вытаращил глаза. «Ну, матушка», — сказал он — «коли ты уже все знаешь, так пожалуй оставайся; мы потолкуем и при тебе». — То-то, батько мой, — отвечала она; — не тебе бы хитрить; посылай-ка за офицерами.","“Listen, you, Vasilisa Yegorovna,” he said to her, coughing. - ""Father Gerasim received, they say, from the city ..."" - Full of lies, Ivan Kuzmich, - interrupted the commandant; you, know, want to call a meeting, but without me to talk about Emelyan Pugachev; Yes, you won't be fooled!

We’ll talk in front of you.” “That’s more like it,” she replied. “You’re no good at being clever. Send for the officers.”","“I say, Vasilisa Yegorovna,” he began, clearing his throat, “Father Gerasim, I hear, has received from town …” “Don’t you tell stories, Ivan Kuzmich,” his wife interrupted him. “I expect you want to call a council to talk about Emelyan Pugachov without me; but you won’t deceive me.” Ivan Kuzmich stared at her. “Well, my dear,” he said, “if you know all about it already, you may as well stay; we will talk before you.” “That’s better, man,” she answered. “You are no hand at deception; send for the officers.”"
"Пугачев уехал. Я долго смотрел на белую степь, по которой неслась его тройка. Народ разошелся. Швабрин скрылся. Я воротился в дом священника. все было готово к нашему отъезду; я не хотел более медлить. Добро наше все было уложено в старую комендантскую повозку. Ямщики мигом заложили лошадей. Марья Ивановна пошла проститься с могилами своих родителей, похороненных за церковью. Я хотел ее проводить, но она просила меня оставить ее одну.

У окошка комендантского дома я увидел стоящего Швабрина. Лицо его изображало мрачную злобу. Я не хотел торжествовать над уничтоженным врагом, и обратил глаза в другую сторону. Наконец мы выехали из крепостных ворот и навек оставили Белогорскую крепость.","Pugachev left. For a long time I looked at the white steppe, along which his troika was rushing. The people dispersed. Shvabrin disappeared. I returned to the priest's house. everything was ready for our departure; I didn't want to delay any longer. All of our goods were packed in the old commandant's wagon. The coachmen immediately laid down the horses. Marya Ivanovna went to say goodbye to the graves of her parents, who were buried behind the church. I wanted to see her off, but she asked me to leave her alone. A few minutes later she returned, shedding silent silent tears. The cart was delivered. Father Gerasim and his wife went out onto the porch. The three of us got into the wagon: Marya Ivanovna with Broadsword and myself. Savelich climbed onto the box. “Farewell, Marya Ivanovna, my dear! Farewell, Pyotr Andreevich, our bright falcon! - said the kind priest. - ""Good luck, and God bless you both!"" We went. At the window of the commandant's house I saw Shvabrin standing. His face showed grim malice. I did not want to triumph over the destroyed enemy, and turned my eyes to the other side. Finally, we left the fortress gates and left the Belogorsk fortress forever.","Pugachov left. I gazed for a long time at the white steppe across which his troika was gliding away. The crowd dispersed. Shvabrin vanished. I returned to Father Gerasim’s. Everything was ready for our departure; I did not want to delay any longer.

Savelich climbed up beside the driver. “Goodbye, Maria Ivanovna, my darling! Goodbye, Pyotr Andreich, our bright falcon!” said kindhearted Akulina Pamfilovna. “Have a safe journey, and may God grant you both happiness!” We set off. I glimpsed Shvabrin, standing at the little window of the commandant’s house. His face was a picture of black fury. Not wanting to gloat over a defeated enemy, I looked the other way. Then we drove out through the main gate and left Fort Belogorsk forever.","Pugachov drove away. I gazed for some time at the white steppe where his troika was galloping. The crowd dispersed. Shvabrin disappeared. I returned to the priest’s house. Everything was ready for our departure. I did not want to delay any longer. All our belongings were packed in the old Commandant’s carriage. The drivers harnessed the horses in a trice. Marya Ivanovna went to say good-bye to the graves of her parents, who were buried behind the church. I wanted to accompany her, but she asked me to let her go alone. She returned in a few minutes, silently weeping quiet tears. The carriage was brought before the house. Father Gerasim and his wife came out onto the steps. The three of us—Marya Ivanovna, Palasha, and I—sat inside the carriage and Savelyich climbed on the box. “Good-bye, Marya Ivanovna, my darling! Good-bye, Pyotr Andreyich, our bright falcon!” kind Akulina Pamfilovna said to us. “A happy journey to you, and God grant you happiness!” We set off. I saw Shvabrin standing at the window of the Commandant’s house. His face was expressive of gloomy malice. I did not want to triumph over a defeated enemy and turned my eyes in another direction. At last we drove out of the fortress gates, and left the Belogorsky fortress for ever."
"Они не знали, кому повиноваться. Правление было всюду прекращено. Помещики укрывались по лесам. Шайки разбойников злодействовали повсюду. Начальники отдельных отрядов, посланных в погоню за Пугачевым, тогда уже бегущим к Астрахани, самовластно наказывали виноватых и безвинных. Состояние всего края, где свирепствовал пожар, было ужасно. Не приведи бог видеть русский бунт — бессмысленный и беспощадный.

Rule was everywhere terminated. The landowners took refuge in the forests. Gangs of robbers were outrageous everywhere. The heads of separate detachments sent in pursuit of Pugachev, who was then already running to Astrakhan, autocratically punished the guilty and the innocent. The state of the entire region, where the fire raged, was terrible. God forbid to see a Russian rebellion - senseless and merciless. Those who are plotting impossible revolutions among us are either young and do not know our people, or they are hard-hearted people, to whom someone else's little head is a half, and their own neck is a penny.","No one knew whom to obey. Law and order broke down; landowners hid in forests. Bands of brigands plundered far and wide; commanding officers of independent detachments sent after Pugachov—who was by then retreating towards Astrakhan—punished both guilty and innocent as the whim took them. The conflagration covered a vast area; throughout it conditions were terrible. God spare us from Russian revolt, senseless merciless Russian revolt. Those who plot impossible, sudden revolutions in Russia are either young and ignorant of our people or else hard-hearted men who care not a straw about either their own lives or the lives of others.","They did not know whom to obey. There was no lawful authority anywhere. The landowners were hiding in the forests. Bands of brigands were ransacking the country.

"Видя мое доброе согласие с Пугачевым, он думал употребить оное в пользу; но мудрое намерение ему не удалось.

I stood by my decision. “As you wish,” said Ivan Ignatich. “Do as you think fit. But why do you want me there? Why should I have to be a witness? Do you think I haven’t seen enough of men fighting? I’ve fought the Swedes, and I’ve fought the Turks.[5] Praise be to God, I’ve seen more than enough of men scrapping.”","The sensible old man’s arguments did not shake me. I stuck to my intention. “As you like,” said Ivan Ignatyich. “Do what you think best. But why should I be your witness? What for? Two men fighting each other!

"Савельич крякнул и стал объясняться. «Это, батюшка, изволишь видеть, реестр барскому добру, раскраденному злодеями…»","Savelich grunted and began to explain himself. “This, father, if you please, is the register of the lordly good, stolen by the villains ...”","Savelich cleared his throat and began to explain. “This, sir, it will be your pleasure to know, is an inventory of the articles of my master’s property made off with by the villains—“","Savelyich cleared his throat and began explaining: “Well, you see, sir, this is a list of my master’s goods stolen by the villains….”"

Something tells me that his Grace has been sent to us by his commanding officers.”","“One need not pity them nor show them favors!” said the old man with the blue ribbon. “There is no harm in hanging Shvabrin; but it wouldn’t be amiss to question this officer thoroughly, too.
