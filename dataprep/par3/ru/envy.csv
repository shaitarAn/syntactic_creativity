(Я вижу, что то, что я присутствую здесь, когда в мыслях его этот самый Володя Макаров, кажется ему оскорбительным.) Я обязан ему жизнью, во-первых. Он спас меня десять лет тому назад от расправы. Меня должны были положить затылком на наковальню и должны были молотом ударить меня по лицу. Он спас меня. (Ему приятно говорить о подвиге того. Видно, часто он вспоминает подвиг.) Но это не важно. Другое важно. Он совершенно новый человек. Ну, ладно. (И он вернулся к столу.)","“This is a completely different young man,” he suddenly said, turning to me. (I see that the fact that I am present here, when this very Volodya Makarov is in his thoughts, seems insulting to him.) I owe him my life, firstly. He saved me ten years ago from reprisal. I was supposed to be put with the back of my head on an anvil and they were supposed to hit me in the face with a hammer. He saved me. (He is pleased to talk about the feat of that one. It is evident that he often recalls the feat.) But this is not important. Another is important. He is a completely new person. OK. (And he returned to the table.)","“This youth is not at all like anyone else,” he said, suddenly turning toward me.

Apparently he often recalls the feat.) But that’s not important. Something else is important. He’s a completely new man. Well, all right.” (And he returned to the desk.)","“He is a youth absolutely unlike anyone else,” he said all of a sudden, turning toward me. (I can see that the fact that I’m present, when this very same Volodya Makarov is in his thoughts, offends him.) “I owe him my life, first of all. He saved me from reprisals ten years ago. They were supposed to lay my nape on the anvil and strike me in the face with a hammer. He rescued me.” (He likes talking about this deed.

"Как футболист Володя представлял собой полную противоположность Гецкэ. Володя был профессионал-спортсмен, – тот был профессионал-игрок.

"Его речь оборвалась. И то он сказал слишком много. Его как будто схватили за последнюю фразу, как можно схватить за руку, – фразу его загнули ему за спину. Он осекся, внезапно испугавшись, и повод для испуга был именно в том, что тот, кого громил он, стоял молча, слушал. Сцена вся и впрямь могла сойти за представление. Так многие и поняли. Часто ведь актеры появляются из публики. И тем более высыпали из деревянного сарайчика настоящие актеры. Да, бабочкой, не чем иным, выпорхнула из-за досок балерина. Эксцентрик в обезьяньем жилете лез на трибуну, цепляясь одной рукой за перекладины, а в другой держа странного вида музыкальный инструмент – длиннющую трубу с тремя раструбами; и так как всего можно было ожидать от человека в обезьяньем жилете и рыжем парике, то легко получалось впечатление, что лезет он каким-то волшебным способом по этой самой трубе. Некто во фраке метался под трибуной, ловя разбегающихся актеров, а те стремились увидеть необычайного оратора. Да ведь и актеры предположили тоже, что кто-то из эстрадников, приглашенный участвовать в концерте, придумал трюк, пришел с подушкой, вступил в спор с докладчиком, а сейчас начнет обычный свой номер. Но нет. Но в страхе съехал по дурацкой трубе эксцентрик! И начиналась тревога. Но не слова, пышно брошенные незнакомцем в толпу, посеяли волнение. Напротив, речь человека воспринялась как умышленная, именно как эстрадный трюк; а вот наступившее молчание зашевелило волосы под многими шапками.","His speech was cut off. And then he said too much. It was as if they grabbed him for the last phrase, as you can grab by the hand - his phrase was bent behind his back. He broke off, suddenly frightened, and the reason for the fright was precisely in the fact that the one whom he smashed stood silently, listening. The whole scene really could pass for a performance. So many have understood. Often after all actors appear from public. And even more so, real actors poured out of a wooden shed. Yes, like a butterfly, nothing else, a ballerina fluttered out from behind the boards. An eccentric in a monkey vest climbed onto the podium, clinging to the crossbars with one hand, and holding a strange-looking musical instrument in the other - a long pipe with three bells; and since everything could be expected from a man in a monkey waistcoat and a red wig, it was easy to get the impression that he was somehow magically climbing this very pipe. Someone in a tailcoat was rushing about under the podium, catching the fleeing actors, who were trying to see the extraordinary orator. Why, the actors also assumed that one of the entertainers, invited to participate in the concert, came up with a trick, came with a pillow, entered into an argument with the speaker, and now begins his usual number. But no. But in fear, the eccentric slid down the stupid pipe! And the anxiety began. But it was not the words pompously thrown by a stranger into the crowd that sowed excitement. On the contrary, a person's speech was perceived as deliberate, precisely as a variety trick; but the ensuing silence stirred the hair under many hats.","His speech broke off. But even so he’d said too much. It was as though they’d grabbed him by the last sentence, as one might grab an arm–they twisted his sentence behind his back. He stopped short, suddenly becoming frightened, and the cause for fright was just that the one against whom he was fulminating was standing silently, was listening. And indeed the whole scene could have been taken for a performance. Many even took it that way. After all, actors often appeared out of the audience. And what’s more the real actors were pouring out of the wooden shed. Yes, like nothing other than a butterfly the ballerina fluttered out from behind the boards. A clown in a monkey suit crawled onto the tribunal, clutching at the crossbeams with one hand and holding in the other a musical instrument of strange appearance–a long, long horn with three bellmouths; and since one might expect anything from a man in a monkey suit and a red wig, the impression was easily given that he was crawling by some magical means along this very horn. Someone in a tail coat rushed about under the tribunal catching the scattering actors, but these were striving to catch sight of the extraordinary orator. Why even the actors too supposed that someone of the variety performers invited to take part in the concert had thought up a stunt, come with a pillow, entered into an argument with the speaker and would right way begin his usual act. But no. The clown slid down his idiotic horn in fear. And the anxiety began. But the words thrown luxuriantly into the crowd by the stranger did not sow the agitation. On the contrary, the man’s speech was taken as deliberate, exactly as a variety stunt; rather the ensuing silence stirred the hair under many caps.","His speech broke off. He had said too much as it was. It was as if he’d been seized by his last phrase, the way you can be seized by the arm: his phrase was bent behind his back. He stopped short, suddenly frightened, and the real reason for his fright was that the man he was fulminating against was standing there in silence, listening. The whole scene could actually have been taken for a performance. That’s how many did take it. Actors often do appear from the audience, after all. Especially since the real actors were drifting out of the wooden shed. Yes, like nothing so much as a butterfly the ballerina flitted out from under the boards. An eccentric in a gorilla suit climbed onto the podium, grabbing onto the crossbar with one hand and with the other holding an odd-looking instrument—a very long horn with three bells. And since you could expect anything from a man in a gorilla suit and a red wig, the impression was easily formed of him climbing by some magical means up that very same pipe. Someone in a tailcoat was dashing about under the podium, trying to corral the scattering actors, who were struggling to see this extraordinary orator. You see, the actors, too, assumed that one of the showmen invited to participate in the concert had come up with a stunt, had brought along a pillow, had got into an argument with the speaker, and now his usual number would begin. But no. In terror, the eccentric slid down that idiotic pipe! Alarm began to spread. But it wasn’t the words the stranger had scattered so luxuriantly on the crowd that sowed the disturbance. On the contrary, the little man’s speech was perceived as intentional, a stunt. Now the ensuing silence raised the hairs under many caps."

"Обычно занимается он гимнастикой не у себя в спальне, а в той неопределенного назначения комнате, где помещаюсь я. Здесь просторней, воздушней, больше света, сияния. В открытую дверь балкона льется прохлада. Кроме того, здесь умывальник. Из спальни переносится циновка. Он гол до пояса, в трикотажных кальсонах, застегнутых на одну пуговицу посредине живота. Голубой и розовый мир комнаты ходит кругом в перламутровом объективе пуговицы. Когда он ложится на циновку спиной и начинает поднимать поочередно ноги, пуговица не выдерживает. Открывается пах. Пах его великолепен. Нежная подпалина. Заповедный уголок. Пах производителя. Вот такой же замшевой матовости пах видел я у антилопы-самца. Девушек, секретарш и конторщиц его, должно быть, пронизывают любовные токи от одного его взгляда.","Usually he does gymnastics not in his bedroom, but in that indeterminate room where I am placed. It is more spacious, airy, more light, radiance. Coolness pours in through the open door of the balcony. In addition, there is a washbasin. A mat is carried from the bedroom.

When he lays down on the mat with his back and begins to raise his legs one by one, the button does not hold. The groin opens. His scent is great. Delicate burn. Protected corner. Groin manufacturer. Here is the same suede matte groin I saw in a male antelope. Girls, secretaries and clerks must be pierced by love currents from one of his glances.","Usually he indulges in gymnastics, not in his own bedroom, but in that room of unprescribed purpose where I am kept.

The azure and rose-colored world of the room revolves in the mother-of-pearl objective of the button. When he lays his back on the mat and begins to raise his legs in turn, the button can’t bear it. The groin is unveiled. His groin is grand. The tender spot. The forbidden corner. The groin of a production man. It’s the same such groin of suede dullness I saw on a buck antelope. The girls, his secretaries and clerks, would certainly be penetrated by love currents from just one glimpse of it.","Usually he does his calisthenics not in his own bedroom but in the room with no specific purpose, the one where I’m staying.

He’s stripped to the waist, wearing knit drawers fastened by a single button in the middle of his belly. The room’s blue-and-pink world revolves in the button’s pearly lens. When he lies down on the mat on his back and starts lifting his legs in alternation, the button can’t take it. His groin is exposed. His groin is magnificent. A tender scorch mark. A forbidden nook. The groin of a Producer. I saw a groin of the exact same sueded matteness once on a bitch antelope. One look from him and his girls, his secretaries and shopgirls, must get love shocks."

"Вытираясь, он вышел из своей комнаты к порогу балкона и, ковыряя полотенцем в ушах, повернулся ко мне спиной. Я увидел эту спину, этот тучный торс сзади, в солнечном свете, и чуть не вскрикнул. Спина выдала все. Нежно желтело масло его тела. Свиток чужой судьбы развернулся передо мною. Прадед Бабичев холил свою кожу, мягко расположились по туловищу прадеда валики жира. По наследству передались комиссару тонкость кожи, благородный цвет и чистая пигментация. И самым главным, что вызвало во мне торжество, было то, что на пояснице его я увидел родинку, особенную, наследственную дворянскую родинку, – ту самую, полную крови, просвечивающую, нежную штучку, отстающую от тела на стебельке, по которой матери через десятки лет узнают украденных детей.","Drying off, he went out of his room to the threshold of the balcony and, picking his ears with a towel, turned his back on me. I saw that back, that fat torso from behind, in the sunlight, and I almost cried out. The back gave everything away. The oil of his body turned softly yellow. A scroll of someone else's fate unfolded before me. Great-grandfather Babichev groomed his skin, rolls of fat gently settled down on the torso of great-grandfather. The thinness of the skin, noble color and pure pigmentation were inherited by the commissioner. And the most important thing that aroused triumph in me was the fact that on his lower back I saw a mole, a special, hereditary noble mole - the same one, full of blood, translucent, tender little thing, lagging behind the body on a stalk, along which mothers through tens years recognize the stolen children.","Drying himself, he walked from his room to the balcony doorway and, twisting the towel in his ears, turned his back to me. I saw this back, the tubby torso, from behind, in the sunlight, and almost screamed. His back gave away everything. His body oil yellowed tenderly. The scroll of another fate unrolled before me. Babichev’s ancestors had pampered their skin; rolls of fat were gently arranged along the backs of his ancestors. As an inheritance to the commissar was passed on the delicateness of skin, the noble color and the pure pigmentation. But the main thing, that which filled me with a sense of victory, was that on the small of his back I saw a birthmark, a special hereditary, aristocratic birthmark–that very blood-filled, translucent, tender little thing, standing out from the body on a small stem, by which after decades mothers recognize their kidnapped children.","Toweling off, he walked out of his room toward the balcony, and a meter and a half away from me, twisting the towel in his ears, he turned his back. I saw that back, that stout back, from behind, in the sunny light, and nearly cried out. The back gave everything away. The tender yellow of his fat body. The scroll of someone else’s fate had unfolded before me. Old man Babichev had cared for his skin; the pads of fat had been softly distributed over his aging torso. My commissar inherited this thin skin, noble color, and pure pigmentation. And most important, what evoked real triumph in me, was the fact that on his waist I saw a mole, a special, inherited, aristocratic mole, the very same kind—blood-filled, a transparent, tender little thing that stood away from his body on a stem—by which mothers recognize stolen children decades later."

"...Был устроен бал. Дети разыгрывали пьесу, исполняли балет на специально устроенной в большой гостиной сцене. И девочка... представляете ли себе? – такая типичная девочка, двенадцати лет, тонконожка в коротком платьице, вся розовая, атласная, расфуфыренная, – ну, знаете, в целом, со своими оборочками, бантами, похожая на цветок, известный под именем «львиной пасти»; красотка, высокомерная, балованная, потряхивающая локонами, – вот такая девочка хороводила на том балу. Она была королевой. Она делала все, что хотела, все восхищались ею, все шло от нее, все стягивались к ней. Она лучше всех танцевала, пела, прыгала, придумывала игры. Лучшие подарки попали к ней, лучшие конфеты, цветы, апельсины, похвалы... Мне было тринадцать лет, я был гимназистом. Она затерла меня. А между тем я тоже привык к восторгам, я тоже был избалован поклонением. У себя в классе и я главенствовал, был рекордсменом. Я не вытерпел. Я поймал девчонку в коридоре и поколотил ее, оборвал ленты, пустил локоны по ветру, расцарапал прелестную ее физиономию. Я схватил ее за затылок и несколько раз стукнул ее лбом о колонну. В тот момент я любил эту девчонку больше жизни, поклонялся ей – и ненавидел всеми силами. Разодрав красоткины кудри, я думал, что опозорю ее, развею ее розовость, ее блеск, и думал, что исправлю допущенную всеми ошибку. Но ничего не вышло. Позор упал на меня. Я был изгнан. Однако, мой милый, обо мне помнили весь вечер; однако бал я испортил им; однако обо мне говорили везде, где появлялась красотка... Так впервые познал я зависть. Ужасна изжога зависти. Как тяжело завидовать! Зависть сдавливает горло спазмой, выдавливает глаза из орбит. Когда терзал я ее там, в коридоре, жертву пойманную, слезы катились из моих глаз, я захлебывался, – и все-таки я рвал восхитительную ее одежду, содрогаясь от прикосновения к атласу, – оно вызывало почти оскомину на зубах и губах. Вы знаете, что такое атлас, ворс атласа, – вы знаете, как прикосновение к нему пронизывает позвоночник, всю нервную систему, какие вызывает гримасы! Так все силы восстали на меня в защиту скверной девчонки. Оскомина, яд, таившийся в кустах и корзинах, вытек из того, что казалось таким очаровательно-невинным в гостиной, – из ее платья, из розового, такого сладкого для глаз атласа. Не помню, издавал ли я какие-либо возгласы, совершая свою расправу. Должно быть, я шептал: «Вот тебе месть! Не затирай! Не забирай того, что может принадлежать мне...»","... A ball was arranged. Children acted out a play, performed a ballet on a stage specially arranged in the large living room. And girl... can you imagine? - such a typical girl, twelve years old, thin-legged in a short dress, all pink, satin, overdressed - well, you know, in general, with her frills, bows, similar to a flower known as the ""lion's mouth""; beauty, arrogant, spoiled, shaking her curls - such a girl danced at that ball. She was queen. She did whatever she wanted, everyone admired her, everything came from her, everyone was attracted to her. She was the best dancer, sang, jumped, invented games. The best gifts got to her, the best sweets, flowers, oranges, praise ... I was thirteen years old, I was a high school student. She wiped me out. Meanwhile, I, too, got used to raptures, I, too, was spoiled by worship. In my class and I dominated, was a record holder. I couldn't bear it. I caught the girl in the corridor and beat her, tore off the ribbons, let the curls fly in the wind, scratched her lovely face. I grabbed her by the back of the head and banged her forehead against the pillar several times. At that moment, I loved this girl more than life, worshiped her - and hated her with all my might. Having torn her beautiful curls, I thought that I would disgrace her, dispel her pinkness, her brilliance, and I thought that I would correct the mistake made by everyone. But nothing happened. Shame fell on me. I was banished. However, my dear, they remembered me all evening; but I ruined the ball for them; however, they talked about me wherever a beauty appeared ... Thus for the first time I knew envy. Terrible heartburn of envy. How difficult it is to envy! Envy constricts the throat with a spasm, squeezes the eyes out of their sockets. When I tormented her there, in the corridor, the victim I had caught, tears rolled from my eyes, I choked, - and yet I tore her delightful clothes, shuddering at the touch of the satin - it almost set my teeth and lips on edge. You know what an atlas is, the pile of an atlas - you know how touching it permeates the spine, the entire nervous system, what grimaces it causes! So all the forces rose up against me in defense of the bad girl. Set on edge, the poison lurking in the bushes and baskets flowed out of what seemed so charmingly innocent in the living room - from her dress, from pink satin, so sweet to the eyes. I don't remember if I uttered any exclamations as I carried out my massacre. I must have whispered: “Here is your revenge! Don't rub! Don't take what might be mine...""","“ …a ball was arranged. The children put on a play, performed a ballet on a specially-set-up stage in the large parlor. And a little girl–can you picture it?–such a typical little girl, twelve years old, slender-legged, in a short little dress, all pink, satiny, all dolled up–well, you know, on the whole, with her little frills, bows, resembling the flower known by the name ‘snapdragon’: a little beauty, haughty, spoiled, shaking her locks–just such a little girl set the step at that ball. She was the queen. She did whatever she wanted, everyone admired her, everything emanated from her, everything drew towards her. She danced, sang, jumped and thought up games better than everyone else. The best gifts fell to her, the best candies, flowers, oranges, praises… I was thirteen, I was a gymansium student. She didn’t give me a chance. Whereas I, too, had become accustomed to rapture, I, too, was spoiled by worship. In my classroom I was even dominant, was the record holder. I couldn’t stand it. I caught the little girl in the corridor and gave her a thrashing, tore off her ribbons, let down her locks into the wind, scratched up her charming physiognomy. I grabbed her by the back of the head and knocked her forehead against a column several times. At that moment I loved this girl more than life, worshipped her–and hated her with all my might. Tearing the beauty’s curls I thought that I’d shame her, disperse her pinkness, her brilliance, and thought that I’d correct the mistake made by everyone. But nothing came of it. The shame fell on me. I was driven out. However, my dear boy, they remembered me all evening; however, I did spoil the ball for them; however, they did talk about me everywhere the beauty appeared… Thus, I experienced envy for the first time. The heartburn of envy is horrible. How oppressive it is to envy! Envy squeezes the throat with a spasm, squeezes the eyes out of their orbits. When I was tormenting her there in the corridor, the captured victim, tears were rolling from my eyes, I was choking–and nevertheless I tore her ravishing clothes, shuddering from the contact with the satin–it evoked almost a soreness on my teeth and lips. You know what satin’s like, the nap of satin–you know how contact with it runs through the spine, the whole nervous system, what sort of grimaces it evokes! So all forces rose up against me in defense of the nasty girl. Soreness, poison, concealed in the bushes and baskets, flowed out from that which had seemed so charmingly innocent in the parlor–out of her dress, out of the pink satin so sweet to the eyes. I don’t remember whether I emitted any cries while committing my reprisal. I probably whispered: ‘Here’s revenge for you! Don’t crowd me. Don’t take away what might belong to me’…","Don’t give up without a fight … I want to tell you about an incident from my childhood. “A gala had been arranged. Children acted out a play and performed a ballet on a stage built especially in a large drawing room. And a little girl … can you imagine her?—a very typical little girl, twelve years old, dainty feet, short dress, all pink, satin, and ruffles, well, you know, the whole shebang—with her chiffon and ribbons, she looked like the flower known as a snapdragon—a beauty, haughty, spoiled, shaking her curls—that’s the kind of girl who was dancing at this ball. She was a queen. She did whatever she wanted, everyone admired her, everything flowed from her and everything was drawn to her. She danced better than anyone, sang, leaped, thought up games. The best presents went to her, the best candies, flowers, oranges, and praises … I was thirteen, a schoolboy. She was outshining me. But meanwhile I, too, was used to ecstatic cries. I, too, had been spoiled by admiration. In my class I was first, the record holder. I couldn’t stand it. I caught her in the corridor and beat her, tore her ribbons, sent her curls flying, scratched her beautiful face. I grabbed her by the nape and rammed her forehead into a column a few times. At that moment I loved that girl more than life, I worshipped her—and hated her with every fiber of my being. By tearing up the beauty’s curls, I thought I would disgrace her, dispel her rosiness, her glow, I thought I would correct the mistake everyone had made. But that’s not what happened. The disgrace fell on me. I was driven out. However, my dear, they did talk about me all evening; and I did spoil the gala for them. They talked about me everywhere the little beauty appeared … Thus for the first time did I know envy. The horrible burning of envy. How hard it is to envy! Envy constricts your throat with a spasm, squeezes your eyes from their sockets. While I was tearing my victim to pieces there, in the corridor, tears rolled from my eyes, I was sobbing—and still I tore her exquisite clothing, trembling at the satin’s touch, which left a bitter taste on my teeth and lips. You know what satin is, the texture of satin—you know how touching it sends a shiver running down your spine, through your whole nervous system, the grimaces it elicits! So all the powers rose up against me in defense of the nasty little girl. The bitter taste, the poison hidden in the bushes and baskets, flowed from what had seemed so enchanting in the drawing room—from her dress, from the pink satin, so sweet to the eyes. I remember emitting these cries while meting out my punishment. I was probably whispering, ‘Here’s your revenge! Don’t try to outshine me! Don’t take what might have belonged to me … ’"

"На аэродроме соединились многие чудеса: тут на поле цвели ромашки, очень близко, у барьера, – обыкновенные дующие желтой пылью ромашки, тут низко, по линии горизонта, катились круглые, похожие на пушечный дым облака; тут же ярчайшим суриком алели деревянные стрелы, указывающие разные направления; тут же на высоте качался, сокращаясь и раздуваясь, шелковый хобот – определитель ветра; и тут же по траве, по зеленой траве старинных битв, оленей, романтики, ползали летательные машины.

Я мечтал всю жизнь о необычайной любви. Скоро я вернусь на старую квартиру, в комнату со страшной кроватью. Там грустное соседство: вдова Прокопович. Ей лет сорок пять, а во дворе ее называют «Анечка». Она варит обеды для артели парикмахеров. Кухню она устроила в коридоре. В темной впадине – плита. Она кормит кошек. Тихие худые кошки взлетают за ее руками гальваническими движениями. Она расшвыривает им какие-то потроха. Пол поэтому украшен как бы перламутровыми плевками.
