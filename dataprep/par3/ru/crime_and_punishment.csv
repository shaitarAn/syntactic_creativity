Dunia gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl’s face, and scrutinized her, perplexed. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise her eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever."

"– Бедная девочка! – сказал он, посмотрев в опустевший угол скамьи. – Очнется, поплачет, потом мать узнает… Сначала прибьет, а потом высечет, больно и с позором, пожалуй и сгонит… А не сгонит, так все-таки пронюхают Дарьи Францовны, и начнет шмыгать моя девочка, туда да сюда… Потом тотчас больница (и это всегда у тех, которые у матерей живут очень честных и тихонько от них пошаливают), ну а там… а там опять больница… вино… кабаки… и еще больница… года через два-три – калека, итого житья ее девятнадцать аль восемнадцать лет от роду всего-с… Разве я таких не видал? А как они делались? Да вот всё так и делались… Тьфу! А пусть! Это, говорят, так и следует… Такой процент, говорят, должен уходить каждый год… куда-то… к черту, должно быть, чтоб остальных освежать и им не мешать. Процент! Славные, право, у них эти словечки: они такие успокоительные, научные. Сказано: процент, стало быть, и тревожиться нечего. Вот если бы другое слово, ну тогда… было бы, может быть, беспокойнее… А что, коль и Дунечка как-нибудь в процент попадет!.. Не в тот, так в другой?..","- Poor girl!

A certain percentage, they say, has to go away every year . . . go away somewhere . . . probably to the devil, so as to invigorate the rest and not interfere with them. A percentage! ** They really have such fine words: they’re so comforting and erudite. Once stated, a percentage, there’s nothing more to worry about.

"– Нет, не на этом, а на его собственных словах. Вот сюда два вечера сряду он приходил к Софье Семеновне. Я вам показывал, где они сидели. Он сообщил ей полную свою исповедь. Он убийца. Он убил старуху чиновницу, процентщицу, у которой и сам закладывал вещи; убил тоже сестру ее, торговку, по имени Лизавету, нечаянно вошедшую во время убийства сестры. Убил он их обеих топором, который принес с собою. Он их убил, чтоб ограбить, и ограбил; взял деньги и кой-какие вещи… Он сам это все передавал слово в слово Софье Семеновне, которая одна и знает секрет, но в убийстве не участвовала ни словом, ни делом, а, напротив, ужаснулась так же, как и вы теперь.

"Говоря это, она суетливо набрасывала на себя мантилью и надевала шляпку; Дунечка тоже оделась. Перчатки на ней были не только заношенные, но даже изодранные, что заметил Разумихин, а между тем эта явная бедность костюма даже придавала обеим дамам вид какого-то особенного достоинства, что всегда бывает с теми, кто умеет носить бедное платье. Разумихин с благоговением смотрел на Дунечку и гордился, что поведет ее. «Та королева, – думал он про себя, – которая чинила свои чулки в тюрьме, уж конечно, в ту минуту смотрела настоящею королевой и даже более, чем во время самых пышных торжеств и выходов».","Saying this, she fussily threw on her mantilla and put on her hat; Dounia was also dressed. Her gloves were not only worn, but even tattered, which Razumikhin noticed, and yet this obvious poverty of the costume even gave both ladies an air of some special dignity, which always happens with those who know how to wear a poor dress. Razumikhin looked with reverence at Dounia and was proud that he would lead her. “That queen,” he thought to himself, “who mended her stockings in prison, certainly looked like a real queen at that moment and even more than during the most magnificent celebrations and exits.”","Saying this, she hastened to throw on her cape and put on her hat while Dunechka also got dressed. Razumikhin noticed that her gloves were not only worn but even frayed. The obvious poverty of their apparel managed to convey to both ladies a look of special distinction, which always happens with those who know how to wear humble clothes. Razumikhin regarded Dunechka with reverence and was proud to be escorting her. “That queen,” he thought to himself, “who mended her own stockings in prison looked like a real queen at that moment and even more so than during the most lavish festivities and regal entrances.”","As she spoke, she hurriedly flung a shawl round her shoulders and put on a little hat; Dunechka put on her things too. Her gloves were not only worn but actually torn, as Razumikhin noticed; and yet the obvious poverty of their dress actually conferred a special kind of dignity on the two ladies, as is always the case when people know how to wear poor clothes well. Razumikhin gazed at Dunechka with adoration, proud that he would be escorting her. ‘ That queen,’ he thought to himself, ‘who darned her own stockings in prison—at that moment, of course, she looked a real queen, even more so than at her most grandiose celebrations and processions.’","While she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle; Dunia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, Razumikhin noticed, were not only shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty gave the two ladies an air of special dignity which is always found in people who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumikhin looked reverently at Dunia and felt proud of escorting her. “The queen who mended her stockings in prison,”28 he thought, “must have looked every inch a queen and even more of a queen than at sumptuous banquets and celebrations.”"

"Пульхерия Александровна с радостью благословила дочь на брак с Разумихиным; но после этого брака стала как будто еще грустнее и озабоченнее. Чтобы доставить ей приятную минуту, Разумихин сообщил ей, между прочим, факт о студенте и дряхлом его отце и о том, что Родя был обожжен и даже хворал, спасши от смерти, прошлого года, двух малюток. Оба известия довели и без того расстроенную рассудком Пульхерию Александровну почти до восторженного состояния. Она беспрерывно говорила об этом, вступала в разговор и на улице (хотя Дуня постоянно сопровождала ее). В публичных каретах,[94] в лавках, поймав хоть какого-нибудь слушателя, наводила разговор на своего сына, на его статью, как он помогал студенту, был обожжен на пожаре и прочее. Дунечка даже не знала, как удержать ее. Уж кроме опасности такого восторженного, болезненного настроения, одно уже то грозило бедой, что кто-нибудь мог припомнить фамилию Раскольникова по бывшему судебному делу и заговорить об этом. Пульхерия Александровна узнала даже адрес матери двух спасенных от пожара малюток и хотела непременно отправиться к ней. Наконец, беспокойство ее возросло до крайних пределов. Она иногда вдруг начинала плакать, часто заболевала и в жару бредила. Однажды, поутру, она объявила прямо, что, по ее расчетам, скоро должен прибыть Родя, что она помнит, как он, прощаясь с нею, сам упоминал, что именно чрез девять месяцев надо ожидать его. Стала все прибирать в квартире и готовиться к встрече, стала отделывать назначавшуюся ему комнату (свою собственную), отчищать мебель, мыть и надевать новые занавески и прочее. Дуня встревожилась, но молчала и даже помогала ей устраивать комнату к приему брата. После тревожного дня, проведенного в беспрерывных фантазиях, в радостных грезах и слезах, в ночь она заболела и наутро была уже в жару и в бреду. Открылась горячка. Чрез две недели она умерла. В бреду вырывались у ней слова, по которым можно было заключить, что она гораздо более подозревала в ужасной судьбе сына, чем даже предполагали.","Pulcheria Alexandrovna gladly blessed her daughter for marriage to Razumikhin; but after this marriage she seemed to become even sadder and more preoccupied. To give her a pleasant moment, Razumikhin told her, among other things, the fact about the student and his decrepit father and that Rodya was burned and even ill, having saved two babies from death last year. Both news brought Pulcheria Alexandrovna, already disturbed by reason, almost to an enthusiastic state. She constantly talked about it, entered into conversation in the street (although Dunya constantly accompanied her). In public carriages, [94] in shops, having caught at least some listener, she would lead the conversation to her son, to his article, how he helped a student, was burned in a fire, and so on. Dounia did not even know how to restrain her. Apart from the danger of such an enthusiastic, sickly mood, one thing already threatened with disaster, that someone could recall Raskolnikov's name from a former court case and talk about it. Pulcheria Alexandrovna even found out the address of the mother of the two babies saved from the fire and wanted to go to her without fail. Finally, her anxiety rose to the extreme. She sometimes suddenly began to cry, often fell ill and was delirious in the heat. Once, in the morning, she announced directly that, according to her calculations, Rodya should arrive soon, that she remembers how, when he said goodbye to her, he himself mentioned that it was in nine months that he should be expected. She began to tidy up everything in the apartment and prepare for the meeting, began to decorate the room assigned to him (her own), clean the furniture, wash and put on new curtains, and so on. Dunya was alarmed, but kept silent and even helped her arrange a room for her brother's reception. After an anxious day spent in uninterrupted fantasies, in joyful dreams and tears, she fell ill at night and in the morning was already in a fever and delirious. Fever opened up. She died two weeks later. In her delirium, words escaped from her, from which one could conclude that she was much more suspicious of the terrible fate of her son than even supposed.","Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna gladly blessed her daughter’s marriage to Razumikhin; but after the ceremony, she seemed to become sadder and more troubled. In order to afford her some pleasant moments, as it were, Razumikhin informed her of the facts about the student and his decrepit father, and about how Rodya received burns and even took ill after saving two children from the fire the previous year. Both pieces of news brought Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna’s already disordered mind almost to a state of ecstasy. She talked about it constantly, and even entered into conversations on the street (although Dunya always accompanied her). In public carriages or in shops, seizing upon some listener, she would lead the conversation to her son, his article, how he helped a student, how he was burned in the fire, and so forth. Dunechka didn’t even know how to restrain her. Besides the danger of such an ecstatic, morbid mood, there was always the chance that someone might recall Raskolnikov’s name from the former legal process and begin talking about it. Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna even found out the address of the mother of the two children rescued from the fire and wanted desperately to go see her. At last her agitation grew to an extreme degree. Sometimes she would suddenly start weeping; she frequently fell ill and would begin raving in a fever. One morning she declared openly that according to her calculations, Rodya should be coming back soon; that she recalled how, at their parting, he himself had reminded her that she should expect him in nine months. She began tidying up the apartment and preparing for the reunion, began to arrange the room intended for him (her own), to polish the furniture, to wash and hang new curtains there, and so on. Dunya became alarmed, but she kept silent and even helped her prepare the room for welcoming her brother. After a fretful day spent in endless fantasies, in joyful daydreams and tears, that night she fell ill and in the morning was in a fever and delirium. A burning fever set in. Two weeks later, she died. In her delirium, words escaped her from which one could conclude that she suspected a great deal more about her son’s terrible fate than they had supposed.","Pulkheria Alexandrovna happily gave her daughter her blessing when she married Razumikhin; but after the wedding she seemed even sadder and more troubled. To give her a moment of pleasure, Razumikhin told her the story about the student and his ailing father, and also about how Rodia had got burned and actually fallen ill after saving the lives of two little children last year. Both these stories brought Pulkheria Alexandrovna’s already disordered mind to a state of near-ecstasy. She talked incessantly about these events, even buttonholing people in the street (though Dunia accompanied her wherever she went). Whenever she got hold of someone who would listen to her, in a public carriage or a shop, she would bring up the subject of her son, and his article, and how he had helped a student, and got himself burned in a house fire, and so on. Dunechka couldn’t think how to control her. Quite apart from the dangers of such a morbidly exalted frame of mind, there was the dreadful risk that someone might mention Raskolnikov’s name in connection with the recent trial, and bring that into the conversation. Pulkheria Alexandrovna even found out the address of the mother of the two rescued children, and made up her mind to go and visit her. Her agitation eventually reached fever pitch. Sometimes she would suddenly burst into tears; often she fell ill and became fevered and delirious. One morning she roundly declared that according to her calculations Rodia was soon due back; she remembered that on parting with her, he had told her to expect him in nine months. So she set about tidying up the whole flat and making ready to receive him, doing up her own room for him, cleaning the furniture, washing and hanging new curtains, and so forth. Though alarmed, Dunia said nothing; in fact she even helped her prepare the room for her brother. After an anxious day filled with endless fantasies, blissful visions, and tears, she fell ill that night, and by morning was feverish and delirious. Her fever worsened, and in two weeks she was dead. In her ravings some words escaped her which showed that she knew a great deal more about her son’s dreadful plight than anyone had thought.","Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dunia’s marriage with Razumikhin; but after the marriage she became even more melancholy and anxious. To give her pleasure Razumikhin told her how Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two little children from a fire. These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s disordered imagination almost to ecstasy. She talked about them continually, even entering into conversation with strangers in the street, though Dunia always accompanied her. In public conveyances and stores, wherever she could capture a listener, she would start talking about her son, his article, how he had helped the student, how he had been burnt in the fire, and so on. Dunia did not know how to restrain her. Apart from the danger of her morbid excitement, there was the risk of someone recalling Raskolnikov’s name and speaking of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted on going to see her. At last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She would sometimes begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. One morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodia should soon be home, that she remembered when he said goodbye to her he said that they must expect him back in nine months. She began to prepare for his arrival, began to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and put up new hangings and so on. Dunia was anxious, but said nothing and helped her to arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual fantasies, in joyful daydreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious. It was brain fever. She died within a fortnight. In her delirium she dropped hints which showed that she knew a great deal more about her son’s terrible fate than they had supposed."

"Он съел немного, без аппетита, ложки три-четыре, как бы машинально. Голова болела меньше. Пообедав, протянулся он опять на диван, но заснуть уже не мог, а лежал без движения, ничком, уткнув лицо в подушку. Ему все грезилось, и всё странные такие были грезы: всего чаще представлялось ему, что он где-то в Африке, в Египте, в каком-то оазисе. Караван отдыхает, смирно лежат верблюды; кругом пальмы растут целым кругом; все обедают. Он же все пьет воду, прямо из ручья, который тут же, у бока, течет и журчит. И прохладно так, и чудесная-чудесная такая голубая вода, холодная, бежит по разноцветным камням и по такому чистому с золотыми блестками песку… Вдруг он ясно услышал, что бьют часы. Он вздрогнул, очнулся, приподнял голову, посмотрел в окно, сообразил время и вдруг вскочил, совершенно опомнившись, как будто кто его сорвал с дивана. На цыпочках подошел он к двери, приотворил ее тихонько и стал прислушиваться вниз на лестницу. Сердце его страшно билось. Но на лестнице было все тихо, точно все спали… Дико и чудно показалось ему, что он мог проспать в таком забытьи со вчерашнего дня и ничего еще не сделал, ничего не приготовил… А меж тем, может, и шесть часов било… И необыкновенная лихорадочная и какая-то растерявшаяся суета охватила его вдруг, вместо сна и отупения. Приготовлений, впрочем, было немного. Он напрягал все усилия, чтобы все сообразить и ничего не забыть; а сердце все билось, стукало так, что ему дышать стало тяжело. Во-первых, надо было петлю сделать и к пальто пришить, – дело минуты. Он полез под подушку и отыскал в напиханном под нее белье одну, совершенно развалившуюся, старую, немытую свою рубашку. Из лохмотьев ее он выдрал тесьму, в вершок шириной и вершков в восемь длиной. Эту тесьму сложил он вдвое, снял с себя свое широкое, крепкое, из какой-то толстой бумажной материи летнее пальто (единственное его верхнее платье) и стал пришивать оба конца тесьмы под левую мышку изнутри. Руки его тряслись, пришивая, но он одолел, и так, что снаружи ничего не было видно, когда он опять надел пальто. Иголка и нитки были у него уже давно приготовлены и лежали в столике, в бумажке. Что же касается петли, то это была очень ловкая его собственная выдумка: петля назначалась для топора. Нельзя же было по улице нести топор в руках. А если под пальто спрятать, то все-таки надо было рукой придерживать, что было бы приметно. Теперь же, с петлей, стоит только вложить в нее лезвие топора, и он будет висеть спокойно, под мышкой изнутри, всю дорогу. Запустив же руку в боковой карман пальто, он мог и конец топорной ручки придерживать, чтоб она не болталась; а так как пальто было очень широкое, настоящий мешок, то и не могло быть приметно снаружи, что он что-то рукой, через карман, придерживает. Эту петлю он тоже уже две недели назад придумал.","He ate a little, without appetite, three or four spoons, as if mechanically. My head hurt less. After dinner, he stretched out again on the sofa, but he could not sleep any more, but lay motionless, prone, his face buried in the pillow. He dreamed everything, and all these were strange dreams: more often it seemed to him that he was somewhere in Africa, in Egypt, in some kind of oasis. The caravan is resting, the camels are quietly lying; all around the palm trees grow in a whole circle; everyone is having dinner. He still drinks water, right from the stream, which flows and murmurs right there, at the side. And so cool, and wonderful, wonderful, such blue water, cold, runs over multi-colored stones and on such pure sand with golden sparkles ... Suddenly he clearly heard that the clock was striking. He shuddered, woke up, raised his head, looked out the window, figured out the time and suddenly jumped up, completely recovering himself, as if someone had ripped him off the sofa. On tiptoe he went to the door, opened it softly and began to listen down the stairs. His heart beat terribly. But everything was quiet on the stairs, as if everyone was asleep ... It seemed wild and wonderful to him that he could have slept in such oblivion since yesterday and had not done anything, had not prepared anything ... And meanwhile, perhaps six hours were beating ... And extraordinary a feverish and some kind of bewildered bustle seized him suddenly, instead of sleep and dullness. However, there were few preparations. He strained every effort to figure everything out and not forget anything; and his heart was beating, beating so that it became difficult for him to breathe. First, it was necessary to make a loop and sew it to the coat - a matter of a minute. He crawled under the pillow and found in the linen stuffed under it one, completely ruined, old, unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a band, one inch wide and eight inches long. He folded this braid in half, took off his wide, strong summer coat made of some kind of thick paper material (his only outer dress) and began to sew both ends of the braid under his left arm from the inside. His hands were shaking while sewing, but he overpowered, and so that nothing could be seen from the outside, when he put on his coat again. The needle and thread had already been prepared for a long time and lay in the table, in a piece of paper. As for the noose, it was a very clever invention of his own: the noose was assigned to the ax. You couldn't carry an ax in your hands down the street. And if you hide it under your coat, you still had to hold it with your hand, which would be noticeable. Now, with a loop, you just have to put the ax blade into it, and it will hang calmly, under the arm from the inside, all the way. Having put his hand into the side pocket of his coat, he could hold the end of the clumsy handle so that it would not dangle; and since the coat was very wide, a real bag, it could not be noticeable from the outside that he was holding something with his hand through his pocket. He also invented this loop two weeks ago.","He ate a little, without much appetite, three or four spoonfuls, as if automatically. His head ached less. After this, he stretched out again on the sofa, but couldn’t fall asleep; he lay there without moving, facedown, buried in his pillow. He kept having daydreams, and they were very strange, indeed: most often he imagined that he was somewhere in Africa, in Egypt, on some sort of oasis. A caravan was taking a rest; camels were lying down peacefully; all around, palm trees grew in a complete circle; everyone was having dinner. He kept drinking water, right from the stream that was there beside him, flowing and murmuring. It was cool there and the water was so marvelously blue and cold, running over multicolored stones and over such pure, golden, glistening sand. . . . Suddenly he heard a clock clearly chiming. He shuddered, came to, raised his head, looked out the window, guessed the time, and jumped up, having come to his senses completely, as if someone had torn him away from the sofa. He approached the door on tiptoe, opened it very quietly, and listened for any noise on the staircase below. His heart was pounding dreadfully. But all was quiet on the staircase, as if everyone was asleep. . . . It seemed reckless and bizarre that he could have been sleeping in such oblivion since yesterday, and that he hadn’t yet done anything, made any preparations. . . . Meanwhile, perhaps the clock was chiming six o’clock. . . . An unusual, feverish, bewildering burst of activity suddenly overtook him, replacing his sleep and stupor. However, there wasn’t much preparation to be done. He made every effort to remember everything and forget nothing; his heart was still pounding, thumping so hard that it became hard for him to breathe. First, he had to make a loop and sew it into his coat—that would take only a minute or so. He groped under his pillow and found among the linen stuffed there an old, ragged, unwashed shirt. He tore off a strip from its tatters, about two inches wide and about fourteen inches long. He folded the strip in two, took off his loose, sturdy summer coat made out of a thick cotton material (it was his only outside coat), and began sewing both ends of the strip together under the left sleeve. His hands shook as he sewed, but he overcame that, so that nothing would be visible from the outside when he put his coat on again. He had long ago prepared a needle and thread, and they had lain wrapped in paper in the little table. As for the loop, that was his own very clever idea: it was designed to hold the axe. After all, he couldn’t walk along the street carrying an axe in his hands. And if he were to hide it under his coat, he’d still have to hold it with his hand, but that would be noticeable. Now, with a loop, he merely had to insert the head of the axe and it could hang there comfortably, inside under his armpit, for the whole way there. If he put his hand into his side pocket, he could grasp the handle to make sure it didn’t swing; and since the coat was very loose, a genuine sack, the fact that he was keeping hold of it with the hand in his pocket wouldn’t be noticed from outside. He had conceived of this loop two weeks ago.","He ate only a little, mechanically and without appetite—not more than three or four spoonfuls. His headache was a bit better. When he had eaten he stretched himself out on the divan again, but now he couldn’t sleep; he lay motionless, face down, burying his head in the pillow. He kept seeing visions, and always very strange ones. Mostly he imagined being somewhere in Africa, in Egypt, by an oasis.—The caravan is resting, the camels lying quietly, there’s a circle of palm trees around them, and everyone is eating their midday meal. He himself keeps drinking water, straight from a brook that flows and gurgles along just beside him. And it’s so cool, and the beautiful, beautiful water, so blue and cold, is flowing over the brightly coloured stones and the clean sand with its specks of shining gold… Suddenly he distinctly heard a clock striking. He roused himself with a start, lifted his head, looked out of the window, realized the time, and leapt straight to his feet, with all his wits about him, as if someone had dragged him up off the divan. He tiptoed to the door, opened it quietly and listened for sounds from downstairs. His heart was pounding hard. But all was quiet on the stairs; everyone seemed to be asleep… He found it weird and extraordinary that he could have slept in such a stupor ever since the previous day, without getting anything done or making anything ready… And by now that clock could have been striking six… Suddenly his drowsy stupor gave way to a strange state of feverish, confused, frantic haste. Not that there was much to prepare. He concentrated as hard as he could, to get everything clear in his mind, without overlooking anything. But his heart was pounding, thumping so hard that it was difficult to breathe. First of all he had to make a loop and sew it into his overcoat—a matter of only a minute. He felt under his pillow, and amongst the underclothes shoved underneath it he found an old, unwashed, completely disintegrating shirt. He tore a strip off this rag, a couple of inches wide and a foot or so long, and folded it in two. Then he took off his broad summer coat, made of some thick, tough cotton material (the only outer garment he possessed), and set about stitching the two ends of the fabric strip to the inside of the coat, under the left armpit. His hands shook as he sewed, but he managed to do it so that nothing was visible on the outside when he put the coat on again. The needle and thread had been got ready a long time ago, and wrapped in a sheet of paper in the table drawer. This loop was a clever invention of his own: it was meant for the axe. He could never have carried an axe in his hands as he walked along the street; and if he had kept it hidden under his coat, he would still have had to hold it in place with one hand, which would have attracted attention. As it was, with the loop, all he had to do was hang the axe blade in it, and there it would hang quietly all the way, inside the coat and under his arm. With his hand in the side pocket of the coat, he could keep hold of the tip of the axe handle to stop it swinging. And since the coat was a very wide one, a real sack, one could never have seen from the outside that his hand was holding on to something inside it. This loop, too, was something he had invented at least two weeks earlier.","He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were, mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring, with his face in the pillow. He was haunted by daydreams and such strange daydreams; in one, that kept recurring, he imagined that he was in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan is resting, the camels are peacefully lying down; the palms stand all around in a complete circle; everyone is eating dinner. But he is drinking water straight from a spring which flows gurgling close by. And it is so cool, and such wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water is running among the colored stones and over the clean sand which glistens here and there like gold . . . Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself, raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was, suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the sofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began listening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet on the stairs as if everyone was asleep . . . It seemed to him strange and monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet . . . And meanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were, distracted, haste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat—a work of a moment. He rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away under it, a completely worn out old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded this strip in two, took off his wide, sturdy summer overcoat of some thick cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook as he sewed, but he prevailed, and so well that nothing showed on the outside when he put the coat on again. He had got the needle and thread ready long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended for the axe. He couldn’t very well carry the axe through the street in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have had to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang quietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the hand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed two weeks before."

"Но только что она вышла, он встал, заложил крючком дверь, развязал принесенный давеча Разумихиным и им же снова завязанный узел с платьем и стал одеваться. Странное дело: казалось, он вдруг стал совершенно спокоен; не было ни полоумного бреду, как давеча, ни панического страху, как во все последнее время. Это была первая минута какого-то странного, внезапного спокойствия. Движения его были точны и ясны, в них проглядывало твердое намерение. «Сегодня же, сегодня же!..» – бормотал он про себя. Он понимал, однако, что еще слаб, но сильнейшее душевное напряжение, дошедшее до спокойствия, до неподвижной идеи, придавало ему сил и самоуверенности; он, впрочем, надеялся, что не упадет на улице. Одевшись совсем во все новое, он взглянул на деньги, лежавшие на столе, подумал и положил их в карман. Денег было двадцать пять рублей. Взял тоже и все медные пятаки, сдачу с десяти рублей, истраченных Разумихиным на платье. Затем тихо снял крючок, вышел из комнаты, спустился по лестнице и заглянул в отворенную настежь кухню: Настасья стояла к нему задом и, нагнувшись, раздувала хозяйкин самовар. Она ничего не слыхала. Да и кто мог предположить, что он уйдет? Через минуту он был уже на улице.","But as soon as she left, he got up, closed the door with a hook, untied the knot with the dress that Razumikhin had brought in earlier and tied again by him, and began to dress. A strange thing: it seemed that he suddenly became completely calm; there was neither crazy delirium, as it had been before, nor panic fear, as in all the last time. It was the first minute of some strange, sudden calm. His movements were precise and clear, they showed firm intention. ""Today, today! .."" - he muttered to himself. He understood, however, that he was still weak, but the strongest mental tension, which had reached calmness, to an immovable idea, gave him strength and self-confidence; he hoped, however, that he would not fall in the street. Having dressed completely in everything new, he looked at the money lying on the table, thought about it and put it in his pocket. There was twenty-five rubles in money. He also took all the copper dimes, change from the ten rubles Razumikhin had spent on a dress. Then he quietly removed the hook, left the room, went down the stairs and looked into the wide-open kitchen: Nastasya stood with her back to him and, bending over, fanned the hostess's samovar. She hadn't heard anything. Who could have guessed that he would leave? A minute later he was on the street.","But as soon as she left, Raskolnikov stood up, fastened the hook on the door, untied the bundle of clothes Razumikhin had delivered earlier, which he’d tied up again, and began to get dressed.

For the first time, he felt a sudden, strange serenity. His movements were precise and assured, his certain intentions clear. “Today, definitely today!” he muttered to himself. Yet he understood that he was still weak, but the strongest spiritual tension that had resulted in this serenity, in unwavering resolution, was also affording him strength and self-assurance; he hoped, however, that he wouldn’t keel over on the street. After having changed completely into his new clothes, he looked at the money left on the table, thought for a bit, and then put it into his pocket. He had twenty-five rubles in cash. He also picked up all the five-kopeck coins, the change from the ten rubles spent on clothes by Razumikhin. Then he quietly unlocked the door, walked out of the room, descended the staircase, and peeked into the open door of the kitchen: Nastasya was standing with her back to him, stooping to fan the fire in the landlady’s samovar. She didn’t hear a thing. And who’d suppose that he’d go out? A minute later, he was already on the street.","But as soon as she was gone, he got up, put the hook on the door, undid the bundle of clothes that Razumikhin had brought with him and then bundled up again, and began to dress. Strangely enough, he had suddenly become perfectly calm—there was none of the half-crazed raving of earlier on, nor of the panic-stricken terror of recent days. This was the first minute of a strange state of sudden tranquility. His movements were crisp and precise, and reflected his firm purpose. ‘Today, this very day!’ he muttered to himself. He realized that he was still weak, but a powerful inner tension had brought him to a state of cool, unshakeable determination, and filled him with strength and confidence. However, he did hope that he wouldn’t keel over in the street. Once he was fully dressed in all his new clothes, he glanced at the money lying on the table, thought for a moment, and pocketed it. It amounted to twenty-five roubles. And he picked up all the copper five-kopek coins that Razumikhin had brought back, the change out of the ten roubles he had spent on clothes. Then he quietly unlatched the door, left the room, walked downstairs, and glanced in through the wide-open kitchen door. Nastasia was standing with her back to him, bending over and blowing on the coals in her mistress’s samovar. She didn’t hear him—and indeed, who could have supposed that he would go out? In another minute he was in the street.","BUT AS SOON AS she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid the parcel which Razumikhin had brought in that evening and started dressing. Curiously, he seemed all at once to have become perfectly calm—not a trace of his recent delirium, nor of the panic that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strange and sudden peace. His movements were precise and definite; there was even a firm purpose to them. “Today, today,” he muttered to himself. He understood that he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him strength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he would not fall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he looked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment’s thought put it in his pocket. It was twenty-five rubles. He also took all of the copper change from the ten rubles spent by Razumikhin on the clothes. Then he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and glanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasia was standing with her back to him, blowing up the landlady’s samovar. She heard nothing. Who would have dreamed that he would go out? A minute later he was in the street."

"– Да ведь все притворяется, черт! – вскричал Разумихин, вскочил и махнул рукой. – Ну стоит ли с тобой говорить! Ведь он это все нарочно, ты еще не знаешь его, Родион! И вчера их сторону принял, только чтобы всех одурачить. И что ж он говорил вчера, господи! А они-то ему обрадовались!.. Ведь он по две недели таким образом выдерживает. Прошлого года уверил нас для чего-то, что в монахи идет: два месяца стоял на своем! Недавно вздумал уверять, что женится, что все уж готово к венцу. Платье даже новое сшил. Мы уж стали его поздравлять. Ни невесты, ничего не бывало: все мираж!","- But everything is pretending, damn it! cried Razumikhin, jumped up and waved his hand. - Well, is it worth talking to you! After all, he did it all on purpose, you don't know him yet, Rodion! And yesterday he took their side, only to fool everyone. And what did he say yesterday, Lord! And they were delighted with him! .. After all, he endures in this way for two weeks. Last year assured us for something that goes to the monks: two months stood his ground! Recently I took it into my head to assure that he was getting married, that everything was already ready for the crown. I even made a new dress. We started to congratulate him. No bride, nothing happened: everything is a mirage!","“Damn it all, he’s pretending!” cried Razumikhin, jumping up and waving his arm. “Is it even worth talking with you? He’s doing all this on purpose, Rodion. You still don’t know him! Yesterday he took their side only to show them up as fools. What didn’t he say yesterday, good Lord! And they were so pleased with him! He can hold out like this for two weeks. Last year he assured us for some reason that he was going to become a monk: for two months he insisted on it! Not long ago he tried to convince us that he was getting married and was all ready for the ceremony. He’d even acquired new clothes for the occasion. We started to congratulate him. But there was no bride, nothing ever happened—it was all a mirage!”","‘Oh, damn him, he’s just pretending!’ cried Razumikhin, leaping up with a dismissive gesture. ‘What’s the point of talking to you? He’s putting it all on, you don’t know him yet, Rodion! Yesterday he was taking their side, just to make fools of us all. And what he was saying yesterday, my Lord! And they were pleased with him! … I mean, he could keep this sort of thing up for two weeks on end. Last year he was persuading us for some reason that he wanted to become a monk; he went on like that for two months! And recently he decided to convince us that he was marrying, and everything was ready for the wedding. He’d even had a new suit made. We were all congratulating him; but there was no bride, nor anything else—it was all a fantasy!’","“Done! Let’s hear, please, how he will prove it!” “He is always humbugging, confound him,” cried Razumikhin, jumping up and gesticulating. “What’s the use of talking to you! He does all that on purpose; you don’t know him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday, simply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they were delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two months. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going to get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered new clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was no bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!”"

"Прежде, когда случалось ему представлять все это в воображении, он иногда думал, что очень будет бояться. Но он не очень теперь боялся, даже не боялся совсем. Занимали его в это мгновение даже какие-то посторонние мысли, только всё ненадолго. Проходя мимо Юсупова сада, он даже очень было занялся мыслию об устройстве высоких фонтанов и о том, как бы они хорошо освежали воздух на всех площадях. Мало-помалу он перешел к убеждению, что если бы распространить Летний сад на все Марсово поле и даже соединить с дворцовым Михайловским садом, то была бы прекрасная и полезнейшая для города вещь. Тут заинтересовало его вдруг: почему именно во всех больших городах человек не то что по одной необходимости, но как-то особенно наклонен жить и селиться именно в таких частях города, где нет ни садов, ни фонтанов, где грязь и вонь и всякая гадость. Тут ему вспомнились его собственные прогулки по Сенной, и он на минуту очнулся. «Что за вздор, – подумал он. – Нет, лучше совсем ничего не думать!»","Before, when it happened to him to imagine all this in his imagination, he sometimes thought that he would be very afraid. But he was not very afraid now, he was not even afraid at all. At that moment even some extraneous thoughts occupied him, only not for long. Passing the Yusupov Garden, he was very much taken up with the idea of arranging high fountains and how they would well refresh the air in all squares. Little by little, he moved to the conviction that if the Summer Garden was extended to the entire Field of Mars and even combined with the palace Mikhailovsky Garden, it would be a wonderful and most useful thing for the city. Then he suddenly became interested: why in all big cities a person is not only because of necessity, but somehow especially inclined to live and settle in such parts of the city where there are no gardens, no fountains, where there is dirt and stench and all kinds of filth. Then he remembered his own walks along the Haymarket, and for a minute he woke up. What nonsense, he thought. ""No, it's better not to think at all!""","Previously, when he had imagined all this, he’d sometimes thought he’d feel very afraid. But now he didn’t feel very afraid; in fact, he didn’t even feel afraid in the least. He was even preoccupied at the time by some extraneous thoughts, but not for very long. Passing the Yusupov Garden, he was about to consider the idea of placing tall fountains there, thinking how well they would refresh the air in all the squares. Little by little he came to the conviction that if the Summer Garden could be extended to include the entire Field of Mars and even connect it with the gardens at the Mikhailovsky Palace, that it would be a splendid and most useful thing for the city. Then suddenly something caught his interest: why exactly was it that in all large cities people were somehow inclined to live and settle, not out of necessity alone, precisely in those parts of town where there were no gardens, no fountains, and where filth and stench prevailed, as well as all sorts of vileness. Then he recalled his own strolls through the Haymarket, and a moment later he came back to his senses. “What nonsense,” he thought. “No, it’s better not to think at all!”","Previously, when picturing all this to himself, he had sometimes thought that he would be very frightened. But he wasn’t very frightened at the moment, in fact not frightened at all. His mind at this moment was occupied with completely irrelevant thoughts; but they didn’t stay with him for long. As he passed Yusupov Park, he briefly became very interested in the design of the tall fountains there, and thought how well they could have cooled the air in all the squares. Bit by bit he persuaded himself that if the Summer Gardens could be extended to occupy the whole of the Field of Mars and even join up with the Mikhailovsky Palace Gardens,* that would be an excellent and valuable thing for the city. And now he suddenly wondered why it was that in all great cities, people chose—not out of bare necessity, but through some sort of special inclination—to settle and live in those particular parts of the city where there were no gardens, no fountains, just dirt and smells and squalor of every kind. And now he recalled his own walks in the Haymarket, and came to himself for a moment. ‘ What nonsense!’ he thought. ‘No, better not think about anything at all!’","When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes thought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very much afraid now, not afraid at all, in fact. His mind was even occupied by irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov Garden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all the squares. Little by little he arrived at the conviction that if the summer garden were extended to all of the Mars Field, and perhaps even joined to the garden of the Mikhailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a great benefit to the town. Then he suddenly became interested in the question why in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there are no gardens nor fountains; where there is filth and stench and all sorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Haymarket came back to his mind, and for a moment he woke up to reality. “What nonsense!” he thought, “better think of nothing at all!”"

"– Да тише же, тише! Ведь услышат! серьезно предупреждаю: поберегите себя. Я не шучу-с! – проговорил шепотом Порфирий, но на этот раз в лице его уже не было давешнего бабьи-добродушного и испуганного выражения; напротив, теперь он прямо приказывал, строго, нахмурив брови и как будто разом нарушая все тайны и двусмысленности. Но это было только на мгновение. Озадаченный было Раскольников вдруг впал в настоящее исступление; но странно: он опять послушался приказания говорить тише, хотя и был в самом сильном пароксизме бешенства.","- Hush, hush! After all, they will hear! Serious warning: take care of yourself. I'm not kidding! - Porfiry said in a whisper, but this time his face no longer had the good-natured and frightened expression of the old woman; on the contrary, now he ordered directly, sternly, knitting his brows and as if at once breaking all secrets and ambiguities. But that was only for a moment. Bewildered, Raskolnikov suddenly fell into a real frenzy; but strangely, he again obeyed the order to speak more quietly, although he was in the most violent paroxysm of fury.","“Quiet down, quiet! They’ll hear! I warn you in earnest: take care of yourself. I’m not joking!” Porfiry said in a whisper, but this time there was none of his previous womanly generosity and frightened expression; on the contrary, now he was plainly ordering him, sternly, knitting his brows and seeming to banish at once all secrets and ambiguities. But that lasted only a moment. Raskolnikov, now perplexed, suddenly flew into a complete fury; but, strange to say, once again he obeyed the order to speak more quietly, even though he was suffering a strong paroxysm of rage.","‘Do be quiet, please! They’ll hear you! I’m warning you, seriously: take care of yourself. I’m not joking!’ whispered Porfiry. But this time he no longer wore his previous expression of simple womanish good nature and alarm; on the contrary, now he was frankly giving orders, with a stern frown, apparently brushing aside in an instant all mystery and ambiguity. But that only lasted a moment. Raskolnikov, after a second’s perplexity, fell into a towering rage; yet the strange thing was that he again obeyed the order to talk quietly, despite being in a perfect paroxysm of fury.","“Hush! Hush! They’ll overhear! I warn you seriously, take care of yourself. I am not joking,” Porfiry whispered, but this time there was not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face. Now he was peremptory, stern, frowning, and for once laying aside all mystification. But this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell into actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command to speak quietly, though he was at the height of his fury."
"– Н-нет, – отвечала Дунечка, оживляясь, – я очень поняла, что это слишком наивно выражено и что он, может быть, только не мастер писать… Это ты хорошо рассудил, брат. Я даже не ожидала…","“N-no,” answered Dounia, brightening up, “I understood very well that this was expressed too naively and that he, perhaps, is just not a master of writing ... You judged that well, brother. I didn't even expect...","“N-no,” replied Dunechka, growing more animated. “I understood very well that it was expressed too artlessly and that perhaps he’s not a very skilled writer. . . . You’re absolutely right, brother. I didn’t even expect that . . .”","‘N-no ,’ replied Dunechka, becoming more animated. ‘I could see quite clearly that it was too naïvely expressed, and that he might just not be very good at expressing himself on paper… You were quite right, brother. I didn’t even expect…’","“N-no,” answered Dunia, with more animation. “I saw clearly that it was too naively expressed, and that perhaps he doesn’t know how to write well . . . that’s a fair criticism, Rodia. I didn’t expect, in fact . . . ”"
"– Самый дальний какой-то; да ты что хмуришься? Что вы поругались-то раз, так ты, пожалуй, и не придешь?","- The most distant one; why are you frowning? Why did you have a fight once, so you probably won't come?","“A very distant one; why are you making such a face? Just because you two had words once, does that mean you won’t come?”","‘A very distant one. What are you scowling for? Just because you fell out with him once, does that mean you won’t be coming now?’","“A very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarreled once, won’t you come then?”"
"– Да, может, и бога-то совсем нет, – с каким-то даже злорадством ответил Раскольников, засмеялся и посмотрел на нее.","“Yes, maybe there is no God at all,” Raskolnikov answered with some even gloating joy, laughed and looked at her.","“Perhaps there’s no such thing as God,” Raskolnikov replied, even with some malicious delight. He began laughing and glanced at her.","‘But maybe God doesn’t even exist,’ replied Raskolnikov with malicious pleasure. Then he laughed and looked at her.","“But, perhaps, there is no God at all,” Raskolnikov answered with a sort of malignance, laughed and looked at her."
"– Ну, слушай же мой отчет, – начал он. – Я к тебе заходил, ты спал. Потом обедали, а потом я пошел к Порфирию. Заметов все у него. Я было хотел начать, и ничего не вышло. Все не мог заговорить настоящим образом. Они точно не понимают и понять не могут, но вовсе не конфузятся. Отвел я Порфирия к окну и стал говорить, но опять отчего-то не так вышло: он смотрит в сторону, и я смотрю в сторону. Я, наконец, поднес к его роже кулак и сказал, что размозжу его, по-родственному. Он только посмотрел на меня. Я плюнул и ушел, вот и все. Очень глупо. С Заметовым я ни слова. Только видишь: я думал, что подгадил, а мне, сходя с лестницы, мысль одна пришла, так и осенила меня: из чего мы с тобой хлопочем? Ведь если б тебе опасность была или там что-нибудь, ну, конечно. А ведь тебе что! Ты тут ни при чем, так наплевать на них; мы же над ними насмеемся потом, а я бы на твоем месте их еще мистифировать стал. Ведь как им стыдно-то потом будет! Плюнь; потом и поколотить можно будет, а теперь посмеемся!","“Well, listen to my report,” he began. - I came to you, you were sleeping. Then they dined, and then I went to Porfiry's. He has all the notes. I wanted to start, and nothing came of it. Everyone could not speak in a real way. They definitely do not understand and cannot understand, but they are not embarrassed at all. I took Porfiry to the window and began to talk, but again for some reason it didn't work out that way: he was looking to the side, and I was looking to the side. Finally, I raised my fist to his face and said that I would crush him, in a relative way. He just looked at me. I spat and left, that's all. Very stupid. I have not a word with Zametov. Just see: I thought I screwed up, but, going down the stairs, one thought came to me, and it dawned on me: why are we fussing? After all, if you were in danger or there was something, well, of course. But what about you! You have nothing to do with it, so don't care about them; we will laugh at them later, and if I were you, I would still mystify them. How embarrassing they will be! Spit; then it will be possible to beat, and now we will laugh!","“Well, listen to my report,” he began. “I dropped in on you and you were asleep. Then I had dinner and went to see Porfiry. Zametov was still with him. I tried to speak, but nothing came of it. I couldn’t find the right way to say it. It’s as if they really don’t understand and won’t be able to, but they’re not ashamed of it. I drew Porfiry over to the window and began talking to him, but once again nothing came of it: he looked away and I did, too. Finally, I raised my fist to his mug and said that I’d smash him, in a familial sort of way. He merely looked at me. I spat and left, and that was that. It was very foolish. I didn’t exchange a word with Zametov. Only you see: I thought that I’d ruined things, but then, as I was going down the stairs, I had an idea, it dawned on me: what are we worrying about? If there was any danger to you, or anything of the sort, then of course. But what’s it to you? You’re not involved in it, so the hell with them; we’ll laugh at them later; and if I were in your place, I’d still try to mystify them further. They’ll be so ashamed afterward! The hell with them; later we can beat them up, but for now, we’ll just laugh!”","‘Well, listen to my story,’ he began. ‘I came round to see you, and you were asleep. Then it was dinner time, and then I went to see Porfiry. Zametov was still there. I was going to tell him, but it didn’t come out right. I couldn’t manage to say what I wanted. They don’t seem to understand—don’t seem able to understand—but that doesn’t bother them in the least. I took Porfiry over to the window and started talking, but for some reason it didn’t come out right that time either—he was avoiding my eye, and I was avoiding his. In the end I shook my fist in his face and told him, in a cousinly way, that I’d beat his brains out. He just looked at me. And I gave up and walked off, and that was it. All very stupid. I didn’t say a word to Zametov. But you see—I was thinking I’d made a mess of everything, but then on my way downstairs I had a thought, it came to me in a flash: what on earth are you and I fussing about? If you were in any danger, or anything like that, well then, of course. But what do you care? This is all nothing to do with you, so to hell with them! We’ll have our laugh at them later on, and if I were in your shoes I’d mystify them some more. Just think how ashamed they’ll be later! Forget the whole thing—we can thrash them one day, but for now let’s just have a laugh!’","“Now let me tell you my story,” he began, “I came to you, you were asleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry’s, Zametov was still with him. I tried to start, but it was no use. I couldn’t speak in the right way. They don’t seem to understand and can’t understand, but they aren’t even slightly ashamed of themselves. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking to him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I’d brain him. He just looked at me, I cursed and left. That was all. It was very stupid. I didn’t say a word to Zametov. But, you see, I thought I’d made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me: why should we bother? Of course, if you were in any danger or anything, but why should you care? You shouldn’t care about them at all. We shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I’d mystify them more than ever. How ashamed they’ll be afterwards! Damn them! We can thrash them afterwards, so let’s laugh at them now!”"
"Впрочем, и это бледное и угрюмое лицо озарилось на мгновение как бы светом, когда вошли мать и сестра, но это прибавило только к выражению его, вместо прежней тоскливой рассеянности, как бы более сосредоточенной муки. Свет померк скоро, но мука осталась, и Зосимов, наблюдавший и изучавший своего пациента со всем молодым жаром только что начинающего полечивать доктора, с удивлением заметил в нем, с приходом родных, вместо радости как бы тяжелую скрытую решимость перенесть час-другой пытки, которой нельзя уж избегнуть. Он видел потом, как почти каждое слово последовавшего разговора точно прикасалось к какой-нибудь ране его пациента и бередило ее; но в то же время он и подивился отчасти сегодняшнему умению владеть собой и скрывать свои чувства вчерашнего мономана, из-за малейшего слова впадавшего вчера чуть не в бешенство.","However, this pale and gloomy face also lit up for a moment, as it were, with light, when the mother and sister entered, but this only added to his expression, instead of the former dreary absent-mindedness, as if more concentrated torment. The light soon faded, but the torment remained, and Zossimov, who was observing and studying his patient with all the youthful fervor of a doctor just beginning to treat, was surprised to notice in him, with the arrival of his relatives, instead of joy, a kind of heavy hidden determination to endure an hour or two of torture, which cannot be avoided. He later saw how almost every word of the ensuing conversation seemed to touch some wound of his patient and stir it; but at the same time, he was somewhat surprised at today's ability to control himself and hide his feelings yesterday's monomaniac, because of the slightest word yesterday he almost fell into a rage.","However, even this pale and gloomy face lit up for a moment when his mother and sister came in, but it merely added to his expression of what seemed to be more concentrated torment, rather than his previous dreary distraction. The light soon faded, but the torment remained, and Zosimov, observing and studying his patient with all the youthful fervor of a doctor just beginning his practice, was surprised to notice instead of joy at the arrival of his family, some painful hidden resolve to endure unavoidable torment for another hour or two. He saw later how almost every word of the ensuing conversation seemed to touch one of his patient’s sore spots and irritate it; but at the same time, he was somewhat surprised by Raskolnikov’s ability to control himself today and to conceal the feelings of yesterday’s monomaniac, who had been goaded almost to the point of madness by the least word spoken.","Even so, this pale and gloomy face seemed to light up for a moment when his mother and sister came in; but that merely transformed his expression of listless dejection into one of more concentrated torment.

He then saw that almost every word of the ensuing conversation seemed to touch a raw nerve of some sort in his patient, and irritate it; yet at the same time he was surprised to see this monomaniac of yesterday now able to control himself and hide his feelings, whereas yesterday he would have been goaded almost to a frenzy by the slightest word.","The pale, somber face lit up for a moment when his mother and sister entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering instead of its listless dejection.

He saw later that almost every word of their conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But at the same time he marveled at the restraint and self-control of a patient who the previous day had, like a monomaniac, become frenzied at the slightest word."

"– Не совсем здоров! – подхватил Разумихин. – Эвона сморозил! До вчерашнего дня чуть не без памяти бредил… Ну, веришь, Порфирий, сам едва на ногах, а чуть только мы, я да Зосимов, вчера отвернулись – оделся и удрал потихоньку и куролесил где-то чуть не до полночи, и это в совершеннейшем, я тебе скажу, бреду, можешь ты это представить! Замечательнейший случай!","- Not very well! Razumikhin picked it up. - Evona froze! Until yesterday, I almost lost my mind ... Well, believe me, Porfiry, he himself is barely on his feet, and as soon as we, I and Zossimov, turned away yesterday, he got dressed and ran away on the sly and played tricks somewhere almost until midnight, and this is in the most perfect , I'll tell you, I'm delirious, can you imagine it! The most wonderful case!","“He wasn’t quite well!” Razumikhin interjected. “What nonsense he’s talking. Until yesterday he was constantly delirious. . . . Well, just think, Porfiry, he could barely stand on his feet, but as soon as we, that is Zosimov and I, let him out of our sight yesterday—he got dressed, slipped out, and was up to some mischief almost until midnight, and all this in his total delirium, I tell you. Can you imagine that? A most extraordinary episode!”","‘Not quite well!’ Razumikhin put in. ‘What nonsense! He was raving, out of his mind, right up to yesterday… Would you believe it, Porfiry, he could barely stand, and yet the moment Zosimov and I left him yesterday, he got up and sneaked away, and was out on the tiles somewhere till nearly midnight, though he was in a state of complete delirium, I tell you. Can you imagine that? Simply extraordinary!’","“Not very well!” Razumikhin caught him up. “What next! He was unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, as soon as our backs were turned, he got dressed, though he could hardly stand, and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight, delirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!”"

"– О будущем муже вашей дочери я и не могу быть другого мнения, – твердо и с жаром отвечал Разумихин, – и не из одной пошлой вежливости это говорю, а потому… потому… ну хоть по тому одному, что Авдотья Романовна сама, добровольно, удостоила выбрать этого человека. Если же я так поносил его вчера, то это потому, что вчера я был грязно пьян и еще… безумен; да, безумен, без головы, сошел с ума, совершенно… и сегодня стыжусь того!.. – Он покраснел и замолчал. Авдотья Романовна вспыхнула, но не прервала молчания. Она не промолвила ни одного слова с той самой минуты, как заговорили о Лужине.","“I can’t have a different opinion about your daughter’s future husband,” Razumikhin answered firmly and fervently, “and I’m not saying this out of vulgar politeness, but because ... because ... well, at least for the fact that Avdotya Romanovna herself, voluntarily, honored to choose this person. If I reviled him like that yesterday, it is because yesterday I was dirty drunk and also ... insane; yes, mad, headless, completely mad... and today I'm ashamed of it!...' He blushed and fell silent. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not break the silence. She had not uttered a single word since the very moment they started talking about Luzhin.","“I can’t hold any other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,” Razumikhin replied with resolution and passion. “I’m not saying this out of any vulgar politeness, but because . . . because . . . well, only because Avdotya Romanovna herself, voluntarily, was the one to choose him. If I reviled him yesterday, it was because I was dead drunk and even . . . insane. Yes, insane, I lost my head , I went crazy, completely . . . and today I’m ashamed of it!” He blushed and fell silent. Avdotya Romanovna blushed deeply but didn’t break her silence. She hadn’t uttered a single word from the moment they had started talking about Luzhin.","‘As regards your daughter’s future husband, I can’t take any other view,’ replied Razumikhin warmly and decisively. ‘ And I’m not just saying that to be boringly polite, but because… because… well, just because Avdotya Romanovna herself has freely consented to choose that man. And if I abused him as I did last night, that’s because I was revoltingly drunk yesterday, and… mad besides: yes, mad, out of my mind, I’d completely lost my reason… and today I’m ashamed of myself!…’ He blushed and stopped. Avdotya Romanovna coloured too, but did not break the silence. Since the conversation first touched on Luzhin she had not said a single word.","“I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,” Razumikhin answered firmly and with warmth, “and I don’t say it simply from vulgar politeness, but because . . . simply because Avdotia Romanovna has of her own free will decided to accept this man. If I spoke so rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and . . . mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely . . . and this morning I am ashamed of it.” He crimsoned and stopped speaking. Avdotia Romanovna flushed, but did not break the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they started talking about Luzhin."

"Но мало отрадного могли вывести Дуня и муж ее по этим известиям, особенно вначале. Соня беспрерывно сообщала, что он постоянно угрюм, несловоохотлив и даже почти нисколько не интересуется известиями, которые она ему сообщает каждый раз из получаемых ею писем; что он спрашивает иногда о матери; и когда она, видя, что он уже предугадывает истину, сообщила ему, наконец, об ее смерти, то, к удивлению ее, даже и известие о смерти матери на него как бы не очень сильно подействовало, по крайней мере, так показалось ей с наружного вида. Она сообщала, между прочим, что, несмотря на то, что он, по-видимому, так углублен в самого себя и ото всех как бы заперся, – к новой жизни своей он отнесся очень прямо и просто, что он ясно понимает свое положение, не ожидает вблизи ничего лучшего, не имеет никаких легкомысленных надежд (что так свойственно в его положении) и ничему почти не удивляется среди новой окружающей его обстановки, так мало похожей на что-нибудь прежнее. Сообщила она, что здоровье его удовлетворительно. Он ходит на работы, от которых не уклоняется и на которые не напрашивается. К пище почти равнодушен, но что эта пища, кроме воскресных и праздничных дней, так дурна, что, наконец, он с охотой принял от нее, Сони, несколько денег, чтобы завести у себя ежедневный чай; насчет всего же остального просил ее не беспокоиться, уверяя, что все эти заботы о нем только досаждают ему. Далее Соня сообщала, что помещение его в остроге общее со всеми, внутренности их казарм она не видала, но заключает, что там тесно, безобразно и нездорово; что он спит на нарах, подстилая под себя войлок, и другого ничего не хочет себе устроить. Но что живет он так грубо и бедно вовсе не по какому-нибудь предвзятому плану или намерению, а так просто от невнимания и наружного равнодушия к своей судьбе. Соня прямо писала, что он, особенно вначале, не только не интересовался ее посещениями, но даже почти досадовал на нее, был несловоохотлив и даже груб с нею, но что под конец эти свидания обратились у него в привычку и даже чуть не в потребность, так что он очень даже тосковал, когда она несколько дней была больна и не могла посещать его. Видится же она с ним по праздникам у острожных ворот или в кордегардии,[95] куда его вызывают к ней на несколько минут; по будням же на работах, куда она заходит к нему, или в мастерских, или на кирпичных заводах, или в сараях на берегу Иртыша. Про себя Соня уведомляла, что ей удалось приобресть в городе даже некоторые знакомства и покровительства; что она занимается шитьем, и так как в городе почти нет модистки, то стала во многих домах даже необходимою; не упоминала только, что чрез нее и Раскольников получил покровительство начальства, что ему облегчаемы были работы и прочее. Наконец, пришло известие (Дуня даже приметила некоторое особенное волнение и тревогу в ее последних письмах), что он всех чуждается, что в остроге каторжные его не полюбили; что он молчит по целым дням и становится очень бледен. Вдруг, в последнем письме, Соня написала, что он заболел весьма серьезно и лежит в госпитале, в арестантской палате…","But Dunya and her husband could derive little comfort from this news, especially at the beginning. Sonya constantly reported that he was constantly gloomy, not talkative, and was even almost not at all interested in the news that she told him each time from the letters she received; that he sometimes asks about his mother; and when she, seeing that he was already foretelling the truth, finally informed him of her death, then, to her surprise, even the news of his mother’s death did not seem to have a very strong effect on him, at least it seemed to her with external view. She reported, among other things, that, despite the fact that he was apparently so deep in himself and, as it were, locked himself away from everyone, he reacted very directly and simply to his new life, that he clearly understands his position, does not expect anything better at hand, has no frivolous hopes (which is so characteristic of his position), and is hardly surprised at anything in the new surroundings, which bear so little resemblance to anything of the past. She reported that his health was satisfactory. He goes to work that he does not shy away from and does not ask for. He is almost indifferent to food, but that this food, except for Sundays and holidays, is so bad that, finally, he willingly accepted from her, Sonya, a few money to get daily tea; about everything else, he asked her not to worry, assuring her that all these worries about him only annoyed him. Further, Sonya reported that his quarters in prison were common with everyone, she did not see the inside of their barracks, but she concluded that it was cramped, ugly and unhealthy; that he sleeps on a bunk bed, spreading felt under him, and does not want to arrange anything else for himself. But that he lives so rudely and poorly not at all according to some preconceived plan or intention, but simply from inattention and outward indifference to his fate. Sonya wrote bluntly that, especially at the beginning, he was not only not interested in her visits, but even almost annoyed with her, was untalkative and even rude to her, but that in the end these meetings turned into a habit with him and even almost a need, so that he was very sad when she was sick for several days and could not visit him. She sees him on holidays at the guard gate or in the guardhouse,[95] where he is summoned to her for a few minutes; on weekdays, at work, where she comes to him, or in workshops, or at brick factories, or in sheds on the banks of the Irtysh. Sonya announced to herself that she even managed to acquire some acquaintances and patronage in the city; that she is engaged in sewing, and since there is almost no milliner in the city, she has even become indispensable in many houses; she only did not mention that through her Raskolnikov also received the patronage of his superiors, that work was made easier for him, and so on. Finally, the news came (Dunya even noticed some special excitement and anxiety in her last letters) that he was a stranger to everyone, that in prison the convicts did not like him; that he is silent for whole days and becomes very pale. Suddenly, in the last letter, Sonya wrote that he had become very seriously ill and was in the hospital, in the prison ward ...","But Dunya and her husband could derive little joy from this news, especially at the beginning. Sonya regularly wrote that Raskolnikov was constantly gloomy, uncommunicative, and even almost lacking all interest in the news she conveyed to him from each letter she received; that sometimes he would ask about his mother; and when Sonya, seeing that he was already surmising the truth, relayed to him at last the news of his mother’s death, to her astonishment, even that seemed not to have much effect on him; at least that was how it seemed from his outward appearance. She wrote, by the way, that in spite of the fact that he was so absorbed in himself and seemed remote from everyone else, he related to his new life very openly and simply; that he understood his position clearly, didn’t expect anything better in the near future, didn’t harbor any frivolous hopes (so characteristic of his situation), and was hardly surprised by anything in his new circumstances, so unlike anything he had ever known before. She told them that his health was satisfactory. He went to work, neither avoiding nor approaching it eagerly. He was indifferent to food, but it was so bad, except for Sundays and holidays, that at last he willingly accepted some money from Sonya to provide for his own tea every day; as for all the rest, he asked her not to trouble herself, assuring her that all her worries merely annoyed him. Further, Sonya wrote that he shared living quarters with all the others in the prison; she hadn’t seen the inside of their barracks but had concluded that it was crowded, horrid, and unsanitary; that he slept on a plank-bed with a strip of felt underneath him; and that he didn’t want to arrange anything better for himself. But she said that he was living so crudely and poorly not at all as a result of some prearranged plan or intention, but simply from inattention and external indifference to his fate. Sonya wrote openly that especially in the beginning, he didn’t take any interest in her visits, and even became annoyed at her; that he was uncommunicative and even rude to her, but that later these meetings became a habit and almost a necessity, so that he even missed them very much when she was ill for a few days and was unable to visit him. On holidays she saw him at the prison gates or in the guardroom, where they would summon him to her for a few minutes; on weekdays she saw him at work when she went into the workshops, or the brick factory, or the sheds on the banks of the Irtysh. About herself, Sonya informed them that she had even been able to make several acquaintances and patrons in town; that she’d found work as a seamstress, and since there were hardly any dressmakers in town, she had become essential in many houses; but she didn’t mention that through her Raskolnikov also received a certain amount of patronage from the authorities, that his workload was lightened, and so forth. At last news arrived (Dunya even noticed a certain agitation and alarm in her latest letters) that he was shunning everybody, and that the other convicts in the prison didn’t really like him; that he was silent for days at a time and was becoming very pale. Suddenly, in her last letter, Sonya wrote that he had fallen very ill and was in the convicts’ ward in the hospital . . .","But there was little cheer for Dunia and her husband in these accounts, at least to start with. Sonia repeatedly wrote that he was constantly sullen, uncommunicative, and almost indifferent to the news she passed on to him every time she received a letter; that he sometimes asked about his mother; and when she eventually saw that he already suspected the truth, and told him his mother had died, she was surprised that even this news didn’t particularly affect him, at least so far as she could see. She also wrote that although he seemed so immersed in his own thoughts, and closed off from everybody else, he accepted his own new way of life in a very direct and simple way, clearly understanding his situation, expecting no improvement any time soon, cherishing no frivolous hopes (so characteristic for people in his situation), and showing almost no surprise at anything about his new life, so unlike anything he had ever known. Sonia said that his health was satisfactory. He carried out his work, not shirking it nor seeking more. He was almost indifferent to his food, though it was so bad (except on Sundays and feast days) that in the end he willingly accepted a little money from Sonia to pay for some tea every day; for the rest, he asked her not to trouble herself, and insisted to her that all her concern for him was merely annoying him. Sonia also wrote that he was in shared accommodation with all the other convicts; she hadn’t seen the inside of the barracks, but understood that they were crowded, dirty, and unhealthy; he slept on a piece of felt stretched over a wooden bunk, and wasn’t interested in improving the arrangement. But she said that his poor, rough conditions weren’t in any way deliberate on his part; it was just that he didn’t notice them and clearly didn’t care about them. Sonia said quite openly that especially at the beginning of his imprisonment, he had not only taken no interest in her visits, but had even been almost irritable with her, uncommunicative and rude, but that in the end these visits had become a habit for him, indeed almost a necessity, so that he really missed her badly when she fell ill and was unable to visit him for several days. On holidays she would see him either by the prison gates or in the guardhouse, where he would be summoned to see her for a few minutes; on working days she would visit him at his outside work, or in a workshop, or the brickworks, or a warehouse on the banks of the Irtysh. For herself, Sonia wrote that she had managed to make some acquaintances and find some protectors in the town; that she occupied herself with sewing, and since there was no proper dressmaker in the town, she had made herself indispensable in several households. What she didn’t mention was that she had managed to get some favours from the authorities for Raskolnikov too, so that he was given easier work and the like. Eventually there came the news (Dunia herself had sensed from her latest letters that she was very anxious and alarmed) that he had started shunning everybody , his fellow prisoners had taken a dislike to him, he might spend days on end without saying a word, and he had grown very pale. And all of a sudden, in her last letter, Sonia wrote to say that he had fallen gravely ill and been moved to the hospital’s prison ward…","But Dunia and her husband could derive little comfort from the news, especially at first. Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and unready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave him from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and that when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last of her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly affected by it, not externally at any rate. She told them that, although he seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off from everyone, he took a very direct and simple view of his new life; that he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time being, had no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, which were so unlike anything he had known before. She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his work without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent about food, but, except on Sundays and holidays, the food was so bad that at last he had been glad to accept some money to have his own tea every day. He begged her not to trouble about anything else, declaring that all the fuss only annoyed him. Sonia wrote further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she had not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But that he lived so poorly and roughly, not from any intention or plan, but simply from inattention and indifference. Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits, had almost been irritated with her for coming; he had even been rude to her and unwilling to talk. But in the end these visits had become a habit and almost a necessity for him, and he was positively distressed when she was ill for several days and could not come to see him. She used to meet him on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he would be brought for a few minutes to be with her. On working days she would go to see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the sheds on the banks of the Irtysh.78 About herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some acquaintances in the town, that she sewed and, as there was scarcely a dressmaker in the vicinity, she was looked upon as an indispensable person in many houses. But she did not mention that the authorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task was lightened and so on. At last the news came (Dunia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and uneasiness in the preceding letters) that he had remained aloof from everyone, that his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for days at a time and was becoming very pale. In the last letter Sonia wrote that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of the hospital."

"Он и прежде проходил часто этим коротеньким переулком, делающим колено и ведущим с площади в Садовую. В последнее время его даже тянуло шляться по всем этим местам, когда тошно становилось, «чтоб еще тошней было». Теперь же он вошел, ни о чем не думая. Тут есть большой дом, весь под распивочными и прочими съестно-выпивательными заведениями; из них поминутно выбегали женщины, одетые, как ходят «по соседству» – простоволосые и в одних платьях. В двух-трех местах они толпились на тротуаре группами, преимущественно у сходов в нижний этаж, куда, по двум ступенькам, можно было спускаться в разные весьма увеселительные заведения. В одном из них в эту минуту шел стук и гам на всю улицу, тренькала гитара, пели песни, и было очень весело. Большая группа женщин толпилась у входа; иные сидели на ступеньках, другие на тротуаре, третьи стояли и разговаривали. Подле, на мостовой, шлялся, громко ругаясь, пьяный солдат с папироской и, казалось, куда-то хотел войти, но как будто забыл куда. Один оборванец ругался с другим оборванцем, и какой-то мертво-пьяный валялся поперек улицы. Раскольников остановился у большой группы женщин. Они разговаривали сиплыми голосами; все были в ситцевых платьях, в козловых башмаках и простоволосые. Иным было лет за сорок, но были и лет по семнадцати, почти все с глазами подбитыми.","Before, he had often passed this short alley, making a knee and leading from the square to Sadovaya. Recently, he was even drawn to wander around all these places, when he became nauseous, ""so that it was even more nauseous."" Now he entered without thinking about anything. There is a large house here, all under drinking and other eating and drinking establishments; every minute women ran out of them, dressed as they go “in the neighborhood” - bare-haired and in the same dresses. In two or three places they crowded on the pavement in groups, mainly at the exits to the lower floor, where, by two steps, one could go down to various very entertaining establishments. In one of them, at that moment, there was a knock and a din throughout the street, a guitar strummed, songs were sung, and it was very fun. A large group of women crowded at the entrance; some sat on the steps, others on the pavement, still others stood and talked. Nearby, on the pavement, a drunken soldier with a cigarette was wandering around, cursing loudly, and it seemed that he wanted to go somewhere, but seemed to have forgotten where. One ragamuffin was arguing with another ragamuffin, and some dead drunk was lying across the street. Raskolnikov stopped by a large group of women. They spoke in hoarse voices; they were all in calico dresses, goat shoes, and bare-haired. Some were over forty, but there were also seventeen years old, almost all with black eyes.","He frequently used to pass along this short street, which made a bend and then led from the square to Sadovaya Street. Lately, when he’d been feeling queasy, he’d even felt like returning to all these places, “to make himself even queasier.” Now, as he turned into the street, he wasn’t thinking about anything. There was a large building filled with taverns and other eating places; women constantly came running out, dressed as if they were “going to visit their neighbors”—bareheaded, wearing only dresses, but no coats. In two or three spots they crowded in groups on the sidewalk, primarily near the entrances to the lower floor, where, a few steps down, one could descend into various extremely entertaining institutions. * In one of them, at that moment, there was a loud noise and a commotion that filled the whole street; a guitar was being strummed, songs were being sung, and it was all very cheerful. A large group of women had collected near the door; some were sitting on the steps, others were gathered on the sidewalk, and still others were standing and chatting. Nearby on the street, a drunken soldier with a cigarette was making his way, cursing loudly; he seemed to want to go in somewhere but had forgotten where. One ruffian was cursing another, and a very drunken fellow was sprawled out in the street. Raskolnikov stopped near a large group of women. Bareheaded and all wearing cotton dresses and goatskin shoes, they were chatting in hoarse voices. Some of them were over forty years old, but others were only about seventeen; almost all had black eyes.","He had often come through this short alleyway, which took a bend on its way from the square towards Sadovaya Street. Recently he had often felt inclined to wander through all these places, when he was feeling sick of things—‘to make everything even more sickening’. But now he entered the alleyway with nothing on his mind at all. Here was a large building, full of taverns and other eating and drinking places; women were constantly coming out of them, dressed for ‘just dropping round to the neighbour’s’, bareheaded and with no coats over their dresses. Here and there they had gathered in groups on the pavement, mostly in front of basement stairways where a couple of steps could bring them into all sorts of highly entertaining establishments. One of these places was reverberating with banging and shouting that filled the street; a guitar twanged, people were singing songs, and there was great merriment. A big crowd of women had gathered by the entrance, some sitting on the steps, some on the pavement, others standing and talking. A drunken soldier shambled along the roadway smoking a cigarette and swearing at the top of his voice; he seemed to be wanting to go in somewhere, but had forgotten where. One ragged tramp was swearing at another, and someone was lying across the road dead drunk. Raskolnikov stopped beside a crowd of women. They were conversing in hoarse voices; all were bareheaded, wearing cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. Some were over forty, others only seventeen or so; almost all had a black eye or two.","He had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading from the market-place to Sadovy Street. Recently he had often felt drawn to wander about this district when he felt depressed, so that he might feel even more so. Now he walked along, thinking of nothing. On the bend there is a large block of buildings, entirely let out to liquor stores and eating-houses; women were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their indoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement, especially around the entrances to various festive establishments on the lower floors. From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street. A crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the steps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunken soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road, swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had forgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man, dead drunk, was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of women, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some not more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes."

"«Ошибка была еще, кроме того, и в том, что я им денег совсем не давал, – думал он, грустно возвращаясь в каморку Лебезятникова, – и с чего, черт возьми, я так ожидовел? Тут даже и расчета никакого не было! Я думал их в черном теле попридержать и довести их, чтоб они на меня как на провидение смотрели, а они вон!.. Тьфу!.. Нет, если б я выдал им за все это время, например, тысячи полторы на приданое, да на подарки, на коробочки там разные, несессеры,[60] сердолики, материи и на всю эту дрянь, от Кнопа,[61] да из английского магазина, так было бы дело почище и… покрепче! Не так бы легко мне теперь отказали! Это народ такого склада, что непременно почли бы за обязанность возвратить в случае отказа и подарки и деньги; а возвращать-то было бы тяжеленько и жалко! Да и совесть бы щекотала: как, дескать, так вдруг прогнать человека, который до сих пор был так щедр и довольно деликатен?.. Гм! Дал маху!» И, заскрежетав еще раз, Петр Петрович тут же назвал себя дураком – про себя, разумеется.","“Besides, it was a mistake that I didn’t give them money at all,” he thought, sadly returning to Lebezyatnikov’s closet, “and why the hell did I expect so much? There wasn't even a calculation! I thought to hold them back in a black body and bring them to look at me like a providence, but they are out! .. Ugh! .. No, if I had given them for all this time, for example, a thousand and a half for a dowry, yes for gifts, for various boxes, travel bags,[60] carnelians, fabrics, and for all this rubbish, from Knop,[61] and from an English store, it would have been a cleaner and ... stronger business! It wouldn't be so easy to be rejected now! This is a people of such a warehouse that they would certainly consider it an obligation to return both gifts and money in case of refusal; but it would be hard and a pity to return it! Yes, and conscience would tickle: how, they say, so suddenly drive away a person who until now has been so generous and rather delicate? .. Hm! Gave a swing! And, gritting again, Pyotr Petrovich immediately called himself a fool - to himself, of course.","“Another mistake I made, besides that, was that I didn’t give them any money,” he thought glumly as he returned to Lebezyatnikov’s little room. “Why the devil did I act like a stingy Jew? There wasn’t even anything to be gained by it! I thought I could keep them on a short leash and make them see me as their good fortune, but look what happened! Damn it! No, if I’d handed them some fifteen hundred rubles for a dowry and for gifts, nice little boxes, toilet cases, jewelry, fabrics, and all sorts of trifles from Knop’s and the English shop, then everything would have turned out better and . . . more certain! They couldn’t have refused me so easily! They’re the sort of people who certainly would have considered it their obligation to return both the gifts and the money in the case of a refusal; and it would have been difficult and painful for them to do so! Besides, their consciences would have bothered them: how, they’d say, can we suddenly drive away a man who’s been so generous and sensitive up to now? Hmm! I let the chance slip by!” Grinding his teeth once again, Petr Petrovich called himself a fool—of course, only to himself.","‘And another mistake I made was never giving them any money,’ he thought, walking despondently back to Lebeziatnikov’s little room. ‘Why did I have to be such a Jew, damn it? I hadn’t begun to think it through! I’d been thinking I’d keep them on a pittance, and get them to see me as their Providence; and now look at them!… Phoo!… No, if I’d given them, say, fifteen hundred roubles over this period, for a dowry, and presents, and boxes of this and that, dressing cases, jewellery, fabrics, and all that trash from Knopp’s and the English shop, * it would all have turned out easier and… surer! They wouldn’t have been quite so keen to turn me down! They’re the sort of people who would have felt duty-bound to hand back my presents, and my money, if they broke it off; and they’d have found that quite difficult and painful! And they’d have had a conscience about it, too: how could they suddenly send a man packing when he’d been so generous and delicate with them so far? Hmm! I played that badly!’ And Piotr Petrovich ground his teeth again, and called himself a fool—only to himself, of course.","“It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,” he thought, as he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov’s room, “and why on earth was I such a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny so that they would turn to me as their providence, and look at them! Foo! If I’d spent about fifteen hundred rubles on them for the trunk and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewelry, materials, and all that sort of trash from Knopp’s47 and the English store, my position would have been better and . . . stronger! They could not have refused me so easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to do it! And their consciences would prick them: how can we dismiss a man who has hitherto been so generous and delicate? . . . Hm! I’ve made a blunder.” And grinding his teeth again, Peter Petrovich called himself a fool—but not aloud, of course."

Вы бесчувственная после этого!.. – горячо прошептал Разумихин над самым ее ухом, крепко стиснув ей руку.","""He's crazy, not insensitive!"" He's crazy! Don't you see it? You are insensible after that!” Razumikhin whispered hotly right in her ear, squeezing her hand tightly.","“He’s in-sane, not in-sensitive! He’s mad! Don’t you see that?

"Ему все не спалось. Мало-помалу давешний образ Дунечки стал возникать пред ним, и вдруг дрожь прошла по его телу. «Нет, это уж надо теперь бросить, – подумал он, очнувшись, – надо о чем-нибудь другом думать. Странно и смешно: ни к кому я никогда не имел большой ненависти, даже мстить никогда особенно не желал, а ведь это дурной признак, дурной признак! Спорить тоже не любил и не горячился – тоже дурной признак! А сколько я ей давеча наобещал, фу черт! А ведь, пожалуй, и перемолола бы меня как-нибудь…» Он опять замолчал и стиснул зубы: опять образ Дунечки появился пред ним точь-в-точь как была она, когда, выстрелив в первый раз, ужасно испугалась, опустила револьвер и, помертвев, смотрела на него, так что он два раза успел бы схватить ее, а она и руки бы не подняла в защиту, если б он сам ей не напомнил. Он вспомнил, как ему в то мгновение точно жалко стало ее, как бы сердце сдавило ему… «Э! к черту! Опять эти мысли, все это надо бросить, бросить!..»","He didn't sleep at all. Little by little the old image of Dounia began to appear before him, and suddenly a shiver went through his body. “No, we must give it up now,” he thought, waking up, “we must think of something else. Strange and ridiculous: I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never even particularly wanted to take revenge, and yet this is a bad sign, a bad sign! He also did not like to argue and did not get excited - also a bad sign! And how much I promised her just now, damn it! But, perhaps, she would grind me down somehow ... ”He fell silent again and clenched his teeth: again the image of Dounia appeared before him exactly as she had been when, having fired for the first time, she was terribly frightened, lowered the revolver and, dead, she looked at him, so that he would have managed to grab her twice, and she would not have raised her hands in defense if he himself had not reminded her. He remembered how at that moment he seemed to feel sorry for her, as if his heart squeezed him ... “Eh! to hell! Again these thoughts, all this must be abandoned, abandoned! .. ""","He couldn’t sleep. Gradually the previous image of Dunechka began to appear before him; all of a sudden a tremor passed through his whole body. “No, I have to cast that aside,” he thought, coming back to his senses. “I must think about something else. It was strange and amusing: I’ve never felt great hatred for anybody, never even wished to take revenge, but that’s a bad sign, a bad sign! I didn’t like arguing and didn’t lose my temper—another bad sign! And I promised her so much then—the hell with it! But she might have remade me somehow . . .” He fell silent again and clenched his teeth: once more the image of Dunechka appeared before him, exactly as she had been when, after she’d fired the gun for the first time, she’d been terribly frightened. She had lowered her revolver and, completely stunned, looked at him; he could have grabbed her twice over—she wouldn’t have raised her arms in her defense if he hadn’t reminded her himself. He recalled how at that moment he had begun to feel sorry for her, as if his heart had contracted. . . . “ Hey! Damn it all! Those thoughts again; I have to cast all this aside, I do!”","He still couldn’t fall asleep. Little by little, the image of Dunechka arose before him, as he had just seen her; and suddenly a shiver ran over his body. ‘ No, I really have to stop this,’ he thought, coming to himself; ‘I must think of something different. How strange and absurd: I’ve never particularly hated anyone, never even especially wanted revenge—but that’s a bad sign, yes, a bad sign! I never enjoyed quarrelling either, and never got heated—another bad sign! What a lot I promised her then— oh, the devil! But I bet she’d have reformed me somehow…’ He stopped again, clenching his teeth: once again the image of Dunechka appeared before him, exactly as she had been when she fired the first shot and, overcome with fright, lowered the revolver and stared dazedly at him; he would have had more than enough time to seize hold of her without her lifting a finger in her defence, if he hadn’t prompted her himself. He remembered actually feeling sorry for her at that moment; remembered a sort of anguish in his heart… ‘Oh the devil! These thoughts again—I have to stop all this! I must stop it!’","He could not get to sleep. By degrees Dunia’s image rose before him, and a shudder ran over him. “No, I must give up all that now,” he thought, rousing himself. “I must think of something else. It’s strange. I never had any great hatred for anyone, I never particularly wanted to revenge myself even, and that’s a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad sign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper—that’s a bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too—Damnation! But—who knows?—perhaps she would have made a new man of me somehow . . . ” He ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Dunia’s image rose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time, she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand to defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that instant he felt almost sorry for her , how he had felt a pang at his heart . . . “Ah! God, these thoughts again! I must put them away!”"

"И, уж конечно, она не могла заметить в эту минуту одного незнакомого ей господина, прилежно следившего за ней и провожавшего ее по пятам. Он провожал ее с самого выхода из ворот. В ту минуту, когда все трое, Разумихин, Раскольников и она, остановились на два слова на тротуаре, этот прохожий, обходя их, вдруг как бы вздрогнул, нечаянно на лету поймав слова Сони: «и спросила: господин Раскольников где живет?» Он быстро, но внимательно оглядел всех троих, в особенности же Раскольникова, к которому обращалась Соня; потом посмотрел на дом и заметил его. Все это сделано было в мгновение, на ходу, и прохожий, стараясь не показать даже виду, пошел далее, убавив шагу и как бы в ожидании. Он поджидал Соню; он видел, что они прощались и что Соня пойдет сейчас куда-то к себе.","And, of course, she could not notice at that moment one gentleman she did not know, diligently watching her and escorting her on her heels. He accompanied her from the very exit from the gate. At that moment, when all three of them, Razumikhin, Raskolnikov and she, stopped for two words on the sidewalk, this passer-by, going around them, suddenly seemed to shudder, accidentally catching Sonya's words on the fly: “and asked: Mr. Raskolnikov, where does he live?” He quickly but carefully looked at all three, especially Raskolnikov, to whom Sonya was addressing; then looked at the house and noticed it. All this was done in an instant, on the move, and the passer-by, trying not to even show it, went on, slowing down his pace and, as it were, in anticipation. He was waiting for Sonya; he saw that they were saying goodbye and that Sonya would now go somewhere to her place.","Of course, at that moment she was unable to observe an unfamiliar gentleman following closely on her heels. He had been following her from the moment she had emerged from the gate.

Then he looked at the house and took note of it. All this happened in a moment, while walking, and the passerby, trying not to let his interest show, went on farther, reducing his speed, as if waiting for someone. He was waiting for Sonya; he saw that they were saying their good-byes and that she was heading straight home.","And of course, at that moment she could not have noticed a certain gentleman, unknown to her, who was following carefully behind her, watching her every step. He had been following her from the moment she came out of the gateway. At that moment, when the three of them, Razumikhin, Raskolnikov and she, had stopped briefly on the pavement to talk, this passer-by had given a start as he walked by them, happening to hear Sonia say ‘so today I asked, where does Mr Raskolnikov live?’ He had thrown a quick but searching look at all three of them, but particularly at Raskolnikov, whom Sonia was addressing. Then he looked at the house, and made a mental note of it. All this had happened in a single instant, as he walked past them. Then this passer-by had walked on, trying not to attract attention, slowing his pace and apparently waiting for something. He was waiting for Sonia: he could see that the three were separating and that Sonia was about to go home, wherever that was.","She was incapable at that instant of noticing the stranger who was watching her and following at her heels.

All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though he were waiting for something.

"Но в ту минуту, как он стоял у перил и все еще бессмысленно и злобно смотрел вслед удалявшейся коляске, потирая спину, вдруг он почувствовал, что кто-то сует ему в руки деньги. Он посмотрел: пожилая купчиха, в головке[27] и козловых башмаках, и с нею девушка, в шляпке и с зеленым зонтиком, вероятно дочь. «Прими, батюшка, ради Христа». Он взял, и они прошли мимо. Денег двугривенный. По платью и по виду они очень могли принять его за нищего, за настоящего собирателя грошей по улице, а подаче целого двугривенного, он, наверно, обязан был удару кнута, который их разжалобил.","But the minute he stood at the railing and was still gazing senselessly and viciously after the retreating carriage, rubbing his back, he suddenly felt that someone was thrusting money into his hands.

He took it and they passed by. Two-kopeck money.

It was a twenty-kopeck piece. Judging by his clothes and appearance, they could easily have mistaken him for a beggar, someone out asking for half-kopeck pieces in the streets; for the gift of a twenty-kopeck piece he was probably obligated to the blow from the whip, which had caused them to take pity on him.","But even as he stood by the parapet, staring after the vanishing carriage in futile rage and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt someone press a coin into his hand.

It was a twenty-kopek piece. By his clothing and general appearance they could well have taken him for a beggar, someone who really solicited small change on the streets; and he probably owed the gift of a whole twenty-kopek piece to the whiplash he had received, which had probably made them sorry for him.","But while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered at the retreating carriage and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand.

"«Что ж это он, за кого меня принимает?» – с изумлением спрашивал себя Раскольников, приподняв голову и во все глаза смотря на Порфирия.","“What is it that he takes me for?” Raskolnikov asked himself in amazement, raising his head and gazing wide-eyed at Porfiry.","“What’s he doing? Who does he take me for?” Raskolnikov asked himself in astonishment, lifting his head and staring intently at Porfiry.","‘What’s he up to?

"– Да неужели же мне и с вами еще тоже надо возиться, – сказал вдруг Раскольников, выходя с судорожным нетерпением прямо на открытую, – хотя вы, может быть, и самый опасный человек, если захотите вредить, да я-то не хочу ломать себя больше. Я вам покажу сейчас, что не так дорожу собою, как вы, вероятно, думаете. Знайте же, я пришел к вам прямо сказать, что если вы держите свое прежнее намерение насчет моей сестры и если для этого думаете чем-нибудь воспользоваться из того, что открыто в последнее время, то я вас убью, прежде чем вы меня в острог посадите. Мое слово верно: вы знаете, что я сумею сдержать его. Второе, если хотите мне что-нибудь объявить, – потому что мне все это время казалось, что вы как будто хотите мне что-то сказать, – то объявляйте скорее, потому что время дорого и, может быть, очень скоро будет уже поздно.","“Is it really necessary for me to mess with you, too,” Raskolnikov suddenly said, going straight out into the open with convulsive impatience, “although you may be the most dangerous person if you want to harm, but I don’t want to break myself more. I will show you now that I do not value myself as much as you probably think. Know that I have come to you directly to tell you that if you keep your former intention regarding my sister, and if you think of using something from what has been discovered lately for this, then I will kill you before you put me in prison. . My word is true: you know that I can keep it. Secondly, if you want to announce something to me - because all this time it seemed to me that you seemed to want to tell me something - then announce it quickly, because time is precious and, perhaps, very soon it will be too late.","“Do I really have to trouble myself also with you?” Raskolnikov asked suddenly, coming straight to the point with feverish impatience. “Even though you might perhaps be a most dangerous person if you chose to harm me? But I don’t want to burden myself anymore. I’ll show you now that I don’t regard myself as highly as you probably think. You should know that I came to see you to tell you outright that if you persevere with your previous intentions concerning my sister, and if you’re thinking of making use of what’s been revealed lately, then I will kill you before you can send me to prison. My word is good: you know that I can keep it. In the second place, if you wish to tell me anything—because it’s seemed to me all the while that you’ve wanted to say something to me—then tell me quickly what it is, because time is valuable and perhaps it’ll soon be too late.”","‘Do I really have to bother myself with you too?’ Raskolnikov demanded abruptly, coming straight to the point in a burst of impatience. ‘You may be the most dangerous man around, if you feel like doing me an injury; but I simply don’t want to trouble myself with you any longer. And now I’m going to show you that I don’t hold myself as dear as you probably think I do. Listen to this: I’ve come to tell you straight out that if your intentions towards my sister are the same as before, and if you’re thinking of making use of anything that’s recently come to light, so as to get your own way, then I’ll kill you before you can get me locked up. I’ll keep my word: you know I can. And secondly: if there’s anything you want to tell me (for I’ve always had the feeling that you wanted to tell me something), then do it quickly, because time’s precious, and very soon it may be too late.’","“Have I got to bother myself now with you too?” said Raskolnikov suddenly, coming straight to the point with nervous impatience. “Even though you might be the most dangerous if you wanted to hurt me, I don’t want to put myself out anymore. I will show you at once that I don’t prize myself as much as you probably think I do. I’ve come to tell you at once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister and if you wish to derive any benefit in that direction from what has been discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up. You can count on my word. You know that I can keep it. And, secondly, if you want to tell me anything—because I keep thinking all the time that you have something to tell me—hurry up and tell it, because time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late.”"

"– Нет? Не знаете? – переспросил Лужин и еще несколько секунд помолчал. – Подумайте, мадемуазель, – начал он строго, но все еще как будто увещевая, – обсудите, я согласен вам дать еще время на размышление. Извольте видеть-с: если б я не был так уверен, то уж, разумеется, при моей опытности, не рискнул бы так прямо вас обвинить; ибо за подобное, прямое и гласное, но ложное или даже только ошибочное обвинение я, в некотором смысле, сам отвечаю. Я это знаю-с. Утром сегодня я разменял, для своих надобностей, несколько пятипроцентных билетов, на сумму, номинально, в три тысячи рублей. Расчет у меня записан в бумажнике. Придя домой, я, – свидетель тому Андрей Семенович, – стал считать деньги и, сосчитав две тысячи триста рублей, спрятал их в бумажник, а бумажник в боковой карман сюртука. На столе оставалось около пятисот рублей, кредитными билетами, и между ними три билета, во сто рублей каждый. В эту минуту прибыли вы (по моему зову) – и все время у меня пребывали потом в чрезвычайном смущении, так что даже три раза, среди разговора, вставали и спешили почему-то уйти, хотя разговор наш еще не был окончен. Андрей Семенович может все это засвидетельствовать. Вероятно, вы сами, мадемуазель, не откажетесь подтвердить и заявить, что призывал я вас через Андрея Семеновича единственно для того только, чтобы переговорить с вами о сиротском и беспомощном положении вашей родственницы, Катерины Ивановны (к которой я не мог прийти на поминки), и о том, как бы полезно было устроить в ее пользу что-нибудь вроде подписки, лотереи или подобного. Вы меня благодарили и даже прослезились (я рассказываю все так, как было, чтобы, во-первых, напомнить вам, а во-вторых, показать вам, что из памяти моей не изгладилась ни малейшая черта). Затем я взял со стола десятирублевый кредитный билет и подал вам, от своего имени, для интересов вашей родственницы и в видах первого вспоможения. Все это видел Андрей Семенович. Затем я вас проводил до дверей, – все в том же, с вашей стороны, смущении, – после чего, оставшись наедине с Андреем Семеновичем и переговорив с ним минут около десяти, Андрей Семенович вышел, я же снова обратился к столу, с лежавшими на нем деньгами, с целью, сосчитав их, отложить, как и предполагал я прежде, особо. К удивлению моему, одного сторублевого билета, в числе прочих, не оказалось. Извольте же рассудить: заподозрить Андрея Семеновича я уж никак не могу-с; даже предположения стыжусь. Ошибиться в счете я тоже не мог, потому что, за минуту перед вашим приходом, окончив все счеты, я нашел итог верным. Согласитесь сами, что, припоминая ваше смущение, торопливость уйти и то, что вы держали руки, некоторое время, на столе; взяв, наконец, в соображение общественное положение ваше и сопряженные с ним привычки, я, так сказать, с ужасом, и даже против воли моей, принужден был остановиться на подозрении, – конечно, жестоком, но – справедливом-с! Прибавлю еще и повторю, что, несмотря на всю мою очевидную уверенность, понимаю, что все-таки в теперешнем обвинении моем присутствует некоторый для меня риск. Но, как видите, я не оставил втуне; я восстал и скажу вам отчего: единственно, сударыня, единственно по причине чернейшей неблагодарности вашей! Как? Я же вас приглашаю в интересах беднейшей родственницы вашей, я же предоставляю вам посильное подаяние мое в десять рублей, и вы же, тут же, сейчас же, платите мне за все это подобным поступком! Нет-с, это уж нехорошо-с! Необходим урок-с. Рассудите же; мало того, как истинный друг ваш, прошу вас (ибо лучше друга не может быть у вас в эту минуту), опомнитесь! Иначе буду неумолим! Ну-с, итак?","- Not? Do not know? Luzhin asked again, and was silent for a few more seconds. “Think, mademoiselle,” he began sternly, but still as if admonishing, “discuss, I agree to give you more time to think. If I had not been so sure, then, of course, with my experience, I would not have ventured to accuse you so directly; for for such a direct and public, but false or even only erroneous accusation, I, in a sense, myself answer. I know that, sir. This morning I exchanged, for my needs, several five-percent tickets, for a nominal sum of three thousand rubles. The calculation is in my wallet. Arriving home, I - Andrei Semyonovich witnessed this - began to count the money and, having counted two thousand three hundred rubles, hid them in my wallet, and the wallet in the side pocket of my coat. There were about five hundred rubles left on the table, in credit notes, and between them were three tickets, one hundred rubles each. At that moment you arrived (at my call) - and all the time afterwards you were extremely embarrassed with me, so that even three times, in the middle of a conversation, you got up and for some reason hurried to leave, although our conversation was not yet over. Andrei Semenovich can testify to all this. Probably, you yourself, mademoiselle, will not refuse to confirm and declare that I called you through Andrei Semyonovich solely to talk with you about the orphan and helpless situation of your relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whom I could not come to the wake), and about how useful it would be to arrange something like a subscription, a lottery, or the like in her favor. You thanked me and even shed tears (I am telling everything as it happened, in the first place, to remind you, and secondly, to show you that not the slightest line has been erased from my memory). Then I took a ten-rouble note from the table and gave it to you, in my own name, for the interests of your relative and as a first aid. Andrei Semenovich saw all this. Then I escorted you to the door - all in the same, on your part, embarrassment - after which, left alone with Andrei Semyonovich and talked with him for about ten minutes, Andrei Semyonovich went out, but I again turned to the table, with those lying on him with money, with the aim, having counted them, to set aside, as I had supposed before, especially. To my surprise, one hundred-ruble ticket, among others, was not found. If you please, judge: I certainly cannot suspect Andrey Semyonovich, sir; I'm embarrassed to even guess. I also could not make a mistake in the account, because, a minute before your arrival, having finished all the accounts, I found the result correct. Agree yourself that, remembering your embarrassment, your haste to leave, and the fact that you kept your hands, for some time, on the table; Finally, taking into account your social position and the habits associated with it, I, so to speak, with horror, and even against my will, was forced to dwell on suspicion - cruel, of course, but - just, sir! I will add and repeat that, despite all my obvious confidence, I understand that there is still some risk for me in my current accusation. But, as you can see, I did not leave in vain; I rebelled and I will tell you why: only, madam, only because of your blackest ingratitude! How? I invite you in the interests of your poorest relative, but I give you my feasible alms of ten rubles, and you, right there, right now, pay me for all this with such an act! No, sir, this is not good, sir! Lesson needed. Consider now; moreover, as your true friend, I ask you (for you cannot have a better friend at this moment), come to your senses! Otherwise, I will be relentless! Well, so?","“No? You don’t?” Luzhin repeated his question and was silent for several seconds. “Think, mademoiselle,” he began sternly, as it were, still exhorting her, “consider carefully. I’m willing to give you more time to reflect. Please understand, ma’am: if I were not so certain, with my experience, of course, I wouldn’t risk accusing you so openly; for such a direct and open, but false, even erroneous accusation, I would, in a certain sense, be held responsible. I know this, ma’am. This morning I exchanged, for some necessary expenses, several five percent bills with the nominal value of three thousand rubles. I have a receipt to that effect in my wallet. Upon returning home, I—Andrey Semyonovich is my witness—began counting the money; after counting two thousand and three hundred rubles, I placed that sum in my wallet and then put my wallet in the side pocket of my jacket. About five hundred rubles in banknotes were left on the table; among them were three notes of one hundred rubles each. At that moment you arrived (at my request); all the while you were extremely agitated, so that three times in the middle of our conversation you even stood up and prepared to leave for some reason, even though the conversation had not yet ended. Andrey Semyonych can bear witness to all this. Most likely, you yourself, mademoiselle, won’t refuse to confirm and declare that I asked you to come, through Andrey Semyonych, solely in order to talk about the orphaned and desperate situation of your relative Katerina Ivanovna (whose funeral dinner I was unable to attend), and about how it might be useful to organize something like a subscription, a lottery, or something similar, for her benefit. You thanked me and even shed some tears (I’m relating everything as it happened in order, first, to remind you and, second, to show you that not the smallest detail has been erased from my memory). I took a ten-ruble note from the table and gave it to you, on my own behalf, as a contribution for your relative and as the first form of assistance. Andrey Semyonovich saw all this. Then I escorted you to the door—while you were still agitated—after which, left alone with Andrey Semyonovich, and conversing with him for almost ten minutes, he left and I turned back to the table where the money was lying, with the aim of finishing my counting and then putting it aside, as I had planned to do previously. To my surprise, a one-hundred-ruble note was not to be found among all the others. Please think carefully: I can’t suspect Andrey Semyonovich, ma’am; I’m even ashamed of the suggestion. I can’t be making a mistake in the amount, because just before your arrival, I’d finished my counting and found the total correct. You’ll agree that recalling your agitation, your haste to leave, and the fact that for a while you had your hands on the table, and, finally, taking into account your social position and its associated habits, I was compelled, so to speak, against my will and with horror, to reach a conclusion—a cruel one, of course, but justified, ma’am! I will add, and I repeat, that in spite of all my evident certainty, I understand that there is still some risk for me in making this accusation now. But as you see, I haven’t left the matter unattended; I have risen up and will tell you why: solely, madam, solely because of your blackest ingratitude! What? I invited you to stop by in the interests of your poor relative; I gave you ten rubles as a contribution within my powers; and you, right here, are repaying me for everything with such an action! No, ma’am, this is not very nice, ma’am! A lesson is needed, ma’am. Consider carefully; moreover, as your true friend, I ask you (since at this moment you don’t have a better friend than I) to reconsider! Otherwise, I will be merciless! Well, ma’am, how about it?”","‘You don’t? You don’t know?’ insisted Luzhin, and waited in silence a few seconds longer. ‘ Think, mademoiselle,’ he said sternly, but still in a coaxing tone, ‘think about it; I am willing to allow you time to reflect. You must understand—if I were not so certain, then obviously with my experience I should never risk directly accusing you like this; for I would, in a sense, have to answer for it if I made such a direct and public accusation and it was then found false, or even merely mistaken. I am aware of that. This morning I had occasion to cash a number of five-per-cent bonds with a nominal value of three thousand roubles. I made a note of the calculations in my pocketbook. On returning home, I proceeded to count this money, as Andrei Semionovich can witness; and having counted out two thousand three hundred roubles, I put that money away in my pocketbook, and placed the pocketbook in the side pocket of my overcoat. There remained on the table some five hundred roubles in banknotes, including three notes of one hundred roubles each. At that moment you arrived (at my invitation), and as long as you were with me you were in a state of extreme embarrassment, so much so that on three occasions, in the middle of our conversation, you rose and seemed for some reason in a hurry to leave, although our conversation was not yet over. Andrei Semionovich can testify to all this. You yourself, mademoiselle, will probably not refuse to confirm and declare that I sent for you, through Andrei Semionovich, for the sole purpose of discussing with you the destitute and helpless situation of your relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose funeral dinner I was unable to attend), and the question of how best to set up something like a subscription, a lottery, or something of the sort, for her benefit. You thanked me, and were even in tears (I am relating everything just as it happened, firstly to remind you, and secondly to show you that not the slightest detail has escaped my memory). After that I picked up a ten-rouble note from the table and handed it to you, as a gift from myself, for the benefit of your relative, for her immediate needs. All this was observed by Andrei Semionovich. Then I saw you to the door—with you still in the same state of embarrassment—after which I remained alone with Andrei Semionovich and talked with him for ten minutes or so. Then he left, and I returned to my table with the money on it, intending to count it and then put it aside in a separate place, as I had already decided. To my surprise, I found that one of the hundred-rouble notes was missing. Now just consider: I cannot possibly suspect Andrei Semionovich— I’m embarrassed even to mention such a thing. Nor can I have made a mistake in the count, since one minute before your arrival I had finished the calculation and found the total to be correct. You must agree that—remembering your confusion, your haste to be gone, and the fact that for some time you had your hands on the table, and finally, considering your social situation and the habits associated with it—I was compelled, in horror, so to speak, and against my will, to harbour a suspicion which, while of course cruel, is justified! I would further add, once again, that despite all my evident certainty, I am aware that my present accusation carries a certain risk to myself. But as you see, I could not let the matter pass. I acted, and I shall tell you why: solely, miss, solely because of your blackest ingratitude! What? I invite you to come and see me in the interests of your destitute relative, and personally offer you such help as I can afford, that is, ten roubles; and instantly, on the spot, you repay me with such a deed! No, miss, that was very, very bad! You need to be taught a lesson. So think well: I am asking you, as your sincere friend (for at this time you could have no better friend than I): think carefully! Otherwise I shall be merciless! So, how is it to be?’",". . I know nothing about it,” Sonia articulated faintly at last. “No, you know nothing?” Luzhin repeated and again he paused for some seconds. “Think for a moment, young lady,” he began severely, but still, as it were, reprimanding her. “Think it over, I am prepared to give you time for consideration. Please observe: if I were not so entirely convinced I would not, you may be sure, with my experience attempt to accuse you so directly. I am aware that for such direct accusation before witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense be made responsible. This morning I changed for my own purposes several five per cent. securities for the sum of approximately three thousand rubles. The account is noted down in my pocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the money, as Mr. Lebeziatnikov will testify, and after counting two thousand three hundred rubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket. About five hundred rubles remained on the table and among them three notes of a hundred rubles each. At that moment you entered (at my invitation) and all the time you were present you were extremely embarrassed; three times you jumped up in the middle of the conversation and tried to leave. Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness to this. You yourself, young lady, will probably not refuse to confirm my statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely in order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend), and the advisability of starting something like a subscription or a lottery for her benefit. You thanked me and even shed tears. I describe all this as it took place, primarily to recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest detail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten-ruble note from the table and handed it to you as a first installment on my part for the benefit of your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then I accompanied you to the door, during which you were still in the same state of embarrassment, after which I was left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov and talked to him for ten minutes; then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I returned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before. To my surprise one hundred-ruble note had disappeared. Please consider my position. Mr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed even to refer to any such suspicion. I cannot have made a mistake in my calculations, because the minute before you came in I had finished my accounts and found the total to be correct. You will admit that when I recalled your embarrassment, your eagerness to leave and the fact that you kept your hands for some time on the table, and taking into consideration your social position and the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, horrified and compelled to entertain a suspicion entirely against my will—a cruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will go further and repeat that despite my positive conviction, I realize that I run a certain risk in making this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass. I have taken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely because of your blackest ingratitude! How is this? I invite you for the benefit of your destitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten rubles and you, on the spot, repay me with an action like that. It is too bad! You need to learn a lesson. Think about it! Moreover, as a true friend I beg you—and you could have no better friend at the moment—think about what you are doing, otherwise I will refuse to alter my position! Well, what do you say?”"

"Он дивился себе. Разумихин был один из его прежних товарищей по университету. Замечательно, что Раскольников, быв в университете, почти не имел товарищей, всех чуждался, ни к кому не ходил и у себя принимал тяжело. Впрочем, и от него скоро все отвернулись. Ни в общих сходках, ни в разговорах, ни в забавах, ни в чем он как-то не принимал участия. Занимался он усиленно, не жалея себя, и за это его уважали, но никто не любил. Был он очень беден и как-то надменно горд и несообщителен: как будто что-то таил про себя. Иным товарищам его казалось, что он смотрит на них на всех, как на детей, свысока, как будто он всех их опередил и развитием, и знанием, и убеждениями, и что на их убеждения и интересы он смотрит как на что-то низшее.","He wondered at himself. Razumikhin was one of his former university friends. It is remarkable that Raskolnikov, being at the university, had almost no comrades, was averse to everyone, did not go to anyone and was hard to receive. However, everyone soon turned away from him. Neither in general gatherings, nor in conversations, nor in amusements, in anything, he somehow did not take part. He worked hard, not sparing himself, and for this he was respected, but no one loved. He was very poor and somehow arrogantly proud and uncommunicative: as if he was hiding something to himself. To some of his comrades it seemed that he looked at them all as children, downright, as if he had outstripped them all in development, knowledge, and convictions, and that he looked at their convictions and interests as something inferior.","He was surprised at himself. Razumikhin was one of his former comrades at the university. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov, who’d been at the university, had hardly any comrades, avoided everyone, visited no one, and received them only unwillingly. Soon everyone turned away from him. Somehow he took no part whatsoever in general gatherings, conversations, amusements, anything. He studied diligently, unsparingly, and for that they respected him, but no one liked him. He was very poor and somehow arrogantly proud and uncommunicative; it was as if he were concealing something inside. To some of his comrades it seemed that he regarded them, everyone, from on high, as children, as if he’d surpassed them in his development, knowledge, and convictions, and regarded their convictions and interests as beneath him.","He was astonished at himself. Razumikhin was one of his old classmates at university. The strange thing was that when Raskolnikov was at university he had had almost no friends, avoided everybody, visited no one and hated being visited. And everyone soon gave up on him. He somehow took no part in general gatherings, or conversations, or amusements, or anything else. He studied hard, he drove himself, and people respected him for that, but no one liked him. He was very poor, but haughty and proud and uncommunicative, as if he were nursing some secret. Some of his companions suspected him of looking down on them as if they were children; as if he had outstripped them all in maturity, knowledge and opinions, and regarded their own opinions and interests as beneath him.","He wondered at himself. Razumikhin was one of his former comrades at the university. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at the university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no-one, and did not welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon turned away from him too. He took no part in the students’ gatherings, amusements or conversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself, and he was respected for this, but no-one liked him. He was very poor, and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though he were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades to look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in development, knowledge and convictions, as though their convictions and interests were beneath him."

"– Нет, вы, я вижу, не верите-с, думаете все, что я вам шуточки невинные подвожу, – подхватил Порфирий, все более и более веселея и беспрерывно хихикая от удовольствия и опять начиная кружить по комнате, – оно, конечно, вы правы-с; у меня и фигура уж так самим богом устроена, что только комические мысли в других возбуждает; буффон-с;[56] но я вам вот что скажу и опять повторю-с, что вы, батюшка, Родион Романович, уж извините меня, старика, человек еще молодой-с, так сказать, первой молодости, а потому выше всего ум человеческий цените, по примеру всей молодежи. Игривая острота ума и отвлеченные доводы рассудка вас соблазняют-с. И это точь-в-точь, как прежний австрийский гофкригсрат,[57] например, насколько то есть я могу судить о военных событиях: на бумаге-то они и Наполеона разбили и в полон взяли, и уж как там, у себя в кабинете, все остроумнейшим образом рассчитали и подвели, а смотришь, генерал-то Мак и сдается со всей своей армией, хе-хе-хе! Вижу, вижу, батюшка Родион Романович, смеетесь вы надо мною, что я, такой статский человек, все из военной истории примерчики подбираю. Да что делать, слабость, люблю военное дело, и уж так люблю я читать все эти военные реляции… решительно я моей карьерой манкировал. Мне бы в военной служить-с, право-с. Наполеоном-то, может быть, и не сделался бы, ну а майором бы был-с, хе-хе-хе! Ну-с, так я вам теперь, родимый мой, всю подробную правду скажу насчет того то есть частного случая-то: действительность и натура, сударь вы мой, есть важная вещь и ух как иногда самый прозорливейший расчет подсекают! Эй, послушайте старика, серьезно говорю, Родион Романович (говоря это, едва ли тридцатипятилетний Порфирий Петрович действительно как будто вдруг весь состарился; даже голос его изменился, и как-то весь он скрючился), – к тому же я человек откровенный-с… Откровенный я человек или нет? Как по-вашему? Уж кажется, что вполне: этакие-то вещи вам задаром сообщаю, да еще награждения за это не требую, хе-хе! Ну, так вот-с, продолжаю-с: остроумие, по-моему, великолепная вещь-с; это, так сказать, краса природы и утешение жизни, и уж какие, кажется, фокусы может оно задавать, так что где уж, кажется, иной раз угадать какому-нибудь бедненькому следователю, который притом и сам своей фантазией увлечен, как и всегда бывает, потому тоже ведь человек-c! Да натура-то бедненького следователя выручает-с, вот беда! А об этом и не подумает увлекающаяся остроумием молодежь, «шагающая через все препятствия» (как вы остроумнейшим и хитрейшим образом изволили выразиться). Он-то, положим, и солжет, то есть человек-то-с, частный-то случай-с… incognito-то-с, и солжет отлично, наихитрейшим манером; тут бы, кажется, и триумф, и наслаждайся плодами своего остроумия, а он хлоп! да в самом-то интересном, в самом скандалезнейшем месте и упадет в обморок. Оно, положим, болезнь, духота тоже иной раз в комнатах бывает, да все-таки-с! Все-таки мысль подал! Солгал-то он бесподобно, а на натуру-то и не сумел рассчитать. Вон оно, коварство-то где-с! Другой раз, увлекаясь игривостию своего остроумия, начнет дурачить подозревающего его человека; побледнеет как бы нарочно, как бы в игре, да слишком уж натурально побледнеет-то, слишком уж на правду похоже, ан и опять подал мысль!

Playful sharpness of mind and abstract arguments of reason seduce you, sir. And this is exactly like the former Austrian gofkriegsrat,[57] for example, as far as I can judge the military events: on paper, they defeated Napoleon and took him to the full, and how it was there, in their office , everyone calculated and summed up in the most ingenious way, and you look, General Mack surrenders with his entire army, hehehehe! I see, I see, father Rodion Romanovich, you are laughing at me that I, such a stately person, select all examples from military history. But what to do, weakness, I love military affairs, and I really love reading all these military reports ... I decidedly skimped on my career. I would like to serve in the military, sir, right, sir. Perhaps he wouldn't have become a Napoleon, but he would have been a major, sir, he-he-he! Well, so now, my dear, I will tell you the whole detailed truth about that, that is, a particular case: reality and nature, my sir, are an important thing, and wow, how sometimes the most far-sighted calculation is undercut! Hey, listen to the old man, I’m talking seriously, Rodion Romanovich (saying this, the hardly thirty-five-year-old Porfiry Petrovich really seems to have suddenly grown old; even his voice has changed, and somehow he’s all crooked), - besides, I’m a frank person, sir ... Am I an outspoken person or not? What do you think? It already seems that it’s quite: I tell you such things for free, and I don’t even demand a reward for it, hehe! Well, so, sir, I continue, sir: wit, in my opinion, is a magnificent thing, sir; it is, so to speak, the beauty of nature and the consolation of life, and what kind of tricks it seems it can set, so where, it seems, sometimes some poor investigator can guess, who, moreover, is carried away by his own imagination, as always , therefore, too, after all, man-c! Yes, the nature of a poor investigator helps out, sir, that's the trouble! And young people who are carried away by wit, ""walking through all obstacles"" (as you deigned to express it in the most witty and cunning way) will not even think about this. He, let's say, will lie, that is, a person, sir, a particular case, sir ... incognito, sir, and lie perfectly, in the most cunning manner; here, it seems, would be a triumph, and enjoy the fruits of your wit, and he clap! Yes, in the most interesting, in the most scandalous place, and he will faint. Let's say it's a sickness, stuffiness also sometimes happens in rooms, but all the same, sir! Still got the idea! He lied incomparably, but he did not manage to calculate on nature. There it is, deceit somewhere! Another time, carried away by the playfulness of his wit, he will begin to fool a person who suspects him; he will turn pale as if on purpose, as if in a game, but he will turn pale too naturally, it looks too much like the truth, but again he gave an idea! Although he will inflate from the first time, but during the night he will think of it, if the little one himself is not a blunder. Why, at every step, so-and-so! Yes, what: he himself will start to run ahead, he will begin to poke his head where they don’t ask, he will start talking incessantly about what he should, on the contrary, be silent, he will start letting in various allegories, hehe! he will come and start asking: why don’t they take me for a long time? heh heh heh! and this, after all, can happen to the most witty person, to a psychologist and a man of letters, sir! Mirror nature, mirror, sir, the most transparent, sir! Look into it and admire it, that's what! Why are you so pale, Rodion Romanovich, aren't you stuffy, why don't you open the window?","“No, I see you don’t believe me, sir; you think I’m playing innocent pranks on you,” Porfiry resumed, becoming more and more cheerful, giggling constantly with enjoyment, and beginning to move around the room once again. “And, of course, you’re right, sir. God created me in such a way that I arouse only comic thoughts in other people; I’m a buffoon, sir; but here’s what I can tell you, sir, and I can repeat it again, sir, that you, old boy, Rodion Romanovich, you should excuse me, just an old man, while you’re still so young, sir, so to speak, in your first youth, and therefore you value human intelligence above all else, according to the custom of all young people. Playful wit and abstract conclusions of reason merely tempt you, sir. It’s precisely like the former Austrian Hofkriegsrath,¶ for example, as much as I can judge military matters: on paper they defeated Napoleon and took him prisoner; they had calculated and figured it all out in their study, but then, you see, General Mack went and surrendered with his entire army, hee-hee-hee! I see, old boy, I see, Rodion Romanovich, that you’re laughing at me, a civilian, for taking my examples from military history. But what’s to be done? It’s a weakness. I love military affairs, and I love reading about all these military communications. . . . Clearly I missed my true calling. I really should have served in the military, sir. I might not have become a Napoleon, but I might have become a major, sir, hee-hee-hee! Well, sir, now, my dear, I’ll tell you the whole truth about this special case, that is: reality and nature, my dear sir, are very important, and they sometimes undercut the most farsighted calculation! Hey, listen to an old man, I’m speaking in earnest, Rodion Romanovich.” (Saying this, Porfiry Petrovich, who was barely thirty-five, suddenly seemed to grow older; even his voice changed, and he seemed more hunched over.) “Besides, I’m a very candid man, sir. . . . Am I candid or not? What’s your opinion? It seems to me that I’m completely candid: I’m telling you all these things for nothing, and I’m not even asking any reward, hee-hee! Well, then, sir, I’ll continue, sir: wit, in my opinion, is a majestic thing, sir; it is, so to speak, the glory of nature and a consolation for life, and what tricks it can sometimes play, so that at times, it seems, it can bewilder even some poor little investigator, who’s distracted by his own fantasy, as always happens, because he’s also only human, sir! Human nature comes to the aid of the poor investigator, that’s the point. A young person, carried away by his own wit, ‘overstepping all obstacles’ (as you were pleased to express it in the wittiest and cleverest fashion), never even thinks about this. Let’s suppose that he, that is, this man, our special case, sir, this incognito, sir, will lie brilliantly, in the cleverest way; this might seem to be a triumph, and he could enjoy the fruits of his wit, but, all of a sudden, bang, he falls into a faint in the most interesting and scandalous place. Let’s suppose it’s an illness, rooms can sometimes be very stuffy, but all the same, sir! Nevertheless, it suggests an idea! He lied incomparably well, but he couldn’t rely on his own nature. There it is, the perfidy, sir! Another time, distracted by the playfulness of his wit, he’ll begin to make fun of the man who suspects him; he’ll grow pale, as if on purpose, as if playing a game, but he grows pale in too natural a way, too much like it was the truth, and once again he’s suggested an idea! Even if his trick succeeds at first, the investigator will think it over at night, if he’s nobody’s fool. And it’s like that every step of the way, sir! Why? He’ll begin to run ahead, butting in where he’s not asked for, he’ll begin talking incessantly about those things he really should keep silent about, he’ll use sly allegories, hee-hee! He himself will come and begin asking questions: why hasn’t he still been arrested? Hee-hee-hee! And this can happen with the cleverest fellow, with a psychologist or a writer, sir! Human nature’s a mirror, a mirror, sir, the most transparent, sir! Look into it and admire, that’s what, sir! Why have you turned so pale, Rodion Romanovich? Is it too stuffy in here? Shall I open a window?”","‘No, I can see that you don’t believe me, you still think I’m playing harmless pranks on you,’ Porfiry began again, becoming increasingly merry and constantly giggling with pleasure, and starting to walk round the room again. ‘ And of course you’re right : God himself created me with the sort of figure that only arouses comical thoughts in others. I’m a buffoon, sir; but let me tell you this, let me repeat it to you: you, my dear friend Rodion Romanovich (excuse an old man for saying so), you’re still young; you’re in your first youth, as it were, and consequently you rate the human intellect above anything else, as all young people do. You’re seduced by playful wit and abstract arguments. And that’s just like the late Austrian Hofkriegsrat, to take an example, as far as I can judge about military matters. Back there in his cabinet he’d done his sums and worked it all out brilliantly, and on paper he had Napoleon beaten and taken prisoner; and then lo and behold, General Mack goes and surrenders with all his army,* heh-heh-heh! Yes, I know, I know, my dear Rodion Romanovich, you’re laughing at me, civilian that I am, constantly going to military history to find my little examples. Well, what can I do—it’s a weakness of mine , I’m fond of military science, and I really love reading about all those military campaigns… truly, I’ve missed my vocation. I should have joined the army, I really should. Perhaps I might never have become a Napoleon—but I would have got to major, heh-heh-heh! Well then, my dear fellow, now I’m going to tell you the whole truth, in every detail, about that particular special case: actual fact and the human temperament, my dear sir, are very important things, and just see how they sometimes undermine the most penetrating calculations! Do listen to an old man, I’m talking seriously, Rodion Romanovich’ (at this point the barely thirty-five-year-old Porfiry Petrovich really did seem to age suddenly; even his voice changed, and he became all hunched up), ‘and besides, I’m a candid person… Am I candid or not? What do you think? I believe I really am; look at the things I’m telling you for nothing, not even looking for a reward, heh-heh! Well, then, to continue: wit, in my opinion, is a splendid thing; it’s like an ornament of nature, and one of life’s consolations, and what tricks it can play! Such tricks that your poor investigator hasn’t a hope of seeing through them, especially when he’s carried away by his own imagination, which is what always happens, because he’s human too! But it’s the individual’s nature that saves the poor investigator, that’s the trouble! That’s what young people never think of, so carried away by their own wit, “striding over all obstacles” (as you so wittily and slyly put it). Let’s suppose he tells a lie, this person I mean, this special case, this unknown quantity; and he’ll tell an excellent lie, most cleverly; you’d think that would be his triumph, and he could start enjoying the fruits of his cleverness; but then—crash! right at the most interesting moment, the most fateful moment, he falls down in a faint! All right, I grant you he’s ill, and sometimes those rooms can get stuffy, but all the same! All the same, he’s given us the idea! He told brilliant lies, but he didn’t allow for his temperament. You see where all that cunning gets you! Or again, he’ll get carried away by his playful cleverness and start making a fool of whoever’s suspecting him, he’ll turn pale seemingly on purpose, seemingly as a prank, only his pallor is all too natural, it looks too much like the real thing, and once again he’s given us the idea! He may fool the investigator at first, but that man will think it out overnight, if he isn’t stupid. And the same thing happens every step of the way! And on top of that, your man starts coming round of his own accord, pushes in when nobody’s asked him to, starts going on and on about things he ought to shut up about, and talking in all sorts of allegories, heh-heh! He comes round by himself and asks why he hasn’t been arrested ages ago, heh-heh-heh! And all this could happen to the cleverest man, someone who knows all about psychology and literature! Temperament is a mirror, yes, a mirror, and a most transparent one! Look into it and admire yourself, that’s what! But why have you turned so pale, Rodion Romanovich, is it too stuffy for you? Shouldn’t we open a window?’","“No, I see you don’t believe me, you think I am playing a harmless joke on you,” Porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chuckling at every instant and again pacing round the room. “And, to be sure, you’re right : God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you and I repeat it, excuse an old man, my dear Rodion Romanovich , you are still a young man, in your first youth, so to speak, and so you put intellect above everything, like all young people. Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and that’s for all the world like the old Austrian Hofkriegsrat,44 as far as I am any judge of military matters, that is: on paper they’d beaten Napoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion, but then General Mack45 surrendered with all his army, he-he-he! I see, I see, Rodion Romanovich, you are laughing at a civilian like me, tak- ing examples out of military history! But I can’t help it , it’s my weakness. I am fond of military science. And I’m ever so fond of reading all the military histories. I’ve certainly missed my proper career. I should have been in the army, I swear I should have been. I wouldn’t have been a Napoleon, but I might have been a major, he-he-he! Well, I’ll tell you the whole truth, my friend, about this special case, I mean: actual fact and a man’s temperament are weighty matters and it’s astonishing how they sometimes deceive the sharpest calculation! I—listen to an old man—am speaking seriously, Rodion Romanovich” (as he said this Porfiry Petrovich, who was scarcely thirty-five, actually seemed to have grown old; even his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together), “moreover, I’m a candid man . . . am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I think I must be: I tell you these things for nothing and don’t even expect a reward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, cleverness in my opinion is a splendid thing , it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of life, and what tricks it can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a poor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he’s liable to be carried away by his own imagination, too, for you know he is a man after all. But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal’s temperament, worse luck for him! But young people carried away by their own wit don’t think of that ‘when they overstep all obstacles’ as you wittily and cleverly expressed it yesterday. He will lie—that is, the man who is a special case, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion; you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his cleverness, but at the most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint. Of course there may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he’s given us the idea! He lied incomparably, but he didn’t reckon on his temperament. That’s what betrays him! Another time he will be carried away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will be too natural, too much like the real thing, again he has given us an idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think differently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like that at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted, speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of allegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks why didn’t you take me long ago, he-he-he! And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man, the psychologist, the literary man. The temperament reflects everything like a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are you so pale, Rodion Romanovich? Is the room stuffy? Shall I open the window?”"

"Он находил его в этот раз до небывалого раздражительным и невнимательным, несмотря на то, что он, Андрей Семенович, пустился было развивать перед ним свою любимую тему о заведении новой, особой «коммуны». Краткие возражения и замечания, вырывавшиеся у Петра Петровича в промежутках между чиканием костяшек на счетах, дышали самою явною и с намерением невежливою насмешкой. Но «гуманный» Андрей Семенович приписывал расположение духа Петра Петровича впечатлению вчерашнего разрыва с Дунечкой и горел желанием поскорее заговорить на эту тему: у него было кой-что сказать на этот счет прогрессивного и пропагандного, что могло бы утешить его почтенного друга и «несомненно» принести пользу его дальнейшему развитию.","This time he found him irritable and inattentive to an unprecedented degree, in spite of the fact that he, Andrei Semyonovich, was about to set off to develop before him his favorite topic of establishing a new, special ""commune"". The brief objections and remarks that burst out of Pyotr Petrovich in the intervals between the ticking of the knuckles on the abacus, breathed the most obvious and deliberately impolite mockery. But the ""humane"" Andrei Semenovich attributed the mood of Pyotr Petrovich to the impression of yesterday's break with Dunechka and was eager to speak on this subject as soon as possible: he had something progressive and propagandistic to say on this subject, which could console his venerable friend and ""undoubtedly"" benefit its further development.","This time he found him unbelievably irritable and inattentive, in spite of the fact that he, Andrey Semyonovich, had begun to expatiate on his favorite theme of establishing a new, special “commune.” The brief objections and remarks that emerged from Petr Petrovich in the intervals between the rhythmic clicking of the abacus beads were steeped in the most obvious and intentionally impolite sarcasm. But the “humane” Andrey Semyonovich ascribed Petr Petrovich ’s disposition to the lingering effects of yesterday’s break with Dunechka; he was burning with a desire to speak about that subject. He had something to say on that account that was both progressive and propagandistic and could console his esteemed friend and “undoubtedly” promote his subsequent development.","On this occasion he was finding Piotr Petrovich unbelievably, exasperatingly inattentive, despite his own attempts to hold forth on his beloved topic of a new and special type of ‘commune’. The curt objections and comments that escaped from Piotr Petrovich in between the clicking of the beads on his abacus breathed the most blatantly rude, deliberate mockery. But Andrei Semionovich ‘humanely’ put Piotr Petrovich ’s mood down to the after-effects of his rupture with Dunechka on the previous day, and burned with a desire to address that question without delay. He had some words of progressive propaganda to contribute, which might console his respected friend and ‘unquestionably’ promote his further enlightenment.","He found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he, Andrei Semionovich, began enlarging on his favorite subject, the foundation of a new special “commune.” The brief remarks that dropped from Peter Petrovich between the clicking of the beads on the abacus betrayed an impolite and unmistakable irony. But the “humane” Andrei Semionovich ascribed Peter Petrovich’s ill-humor to his recent breach with Dunia and he was burning with impatience to talk about it. He had something progressive to say on the subject which might comfort his eminent friend and “could not fail” to promote his development. “There is some sort of entertainment being prepared at that . . ."

"– Ах, ах, как нехорошо! Ах, стыдно-то как, барышня, стыд-то какой! – Он опять закачал головой, стыдя, сожалея и негодуя. – Ведь вот задача! – обратился он к Раскольникову и тут же, мельком, опять оглядел его с ног до головы. Странен, верно, и он ему показался: в таких лохмотьях, а сам деньги выдает!","- Oh, oh, how bad it is! Oh, how ashamed, young lady, what a shame! He shook his head again, ashamed, regretful and indignant. - This is the task! - he turned to Raskolnikov and immediately, briefly, again looked him from head to toe. Strange, right, and he seemed to him: in such rags, and he gives out money!","“Ah, dear me, this is bad! Ah, aren’t you ashamed, young lady? What a shame!” he said, shaking his head again, feeling embarrassed, compassionate, and indignant. “What a dilemma!” he said, turning to Raskolnikov, right there and then looking him over rapidly from head to toe. Raskolnikov must have appeared a bit strange to the policeman: he was in tatters, yet was giving away his own money!","‘Oh dear, oh dear, that’s not good! Oh, what a shame, young miss, what a disgrace!’ He shook his head again, with disapproval, pity, and indignation. ‘ Well, here’s a problem!’ he said to Raskolnikov, and instantly sized him up again from head to foot. This was another odd creature—dressed in such rags, and handing out money!","“Ah, ah, how awful! It’s shameful, young lady, it’s a shame!” He shook his head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant. “It’s a difficult job,” the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he did so, he again looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must have seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!"
"«Да когда ж это бывало? Никаких я дел сам по себе не имею с полицией! И почему как раз сегодня? – думал он в мучительном недоумении. – Господи, поскорей бы уж!» Он было бросился на колени молиться, но даже сам рассмеялся, – не над молитвой, а над собой. Он поспешно стал одеваться. «Пропаду так пропаду, все равно! Носок надеть! – вздумалось вдруг ему, – еще больше затрется в пыли, и следы пропадут». Но только что он надел, тотчас же и сдернул его с отвращением и ужасом. Сдернул, но, сообразив, что другого нет, взял и надел опять – и опять рассмеялся. «Все это условно, все относительно, все это одни только формы, – подумал он мельком, одним только краешком мысли, а сам дрожа всем телом, – ведь вот надел же! Ведь кончил же тем, что надел!» Смех, впрочем, тотчас же сменился отчаянием. «Нет, не по силам…» – подумалось ему. Ноги его дрожали. «От страху», – пробормотал он про себя. Голова кружилась и болела от жару. «Это хитрость! Это они хотят заманить меня хитростью и вдруг сбить на всем», – продолжал он про себя, выходя на лестницу. «Скверно то, что я почти в бреду… я могу соврать какую-нибудь глупость…»","“When did that happen? I have nothing to do with the police myself! And why just today? He thought in agonizing bewilderment. - Lord, hurry up! "" He started to kneel down to pray, but he even laughed himself - not at prayer, but at himself. He hurriedly began to dress. “I’ll be so lost, it’s all the same! Put on a sock! - he suddenly thought, - it will get even more rubbed in the dust, and the traces will disappear. "" But as soon as he put it on, he immediately pulled it off with disgust and horror. He pulled it off, but realizing that there was no other, took it and put it on again - and again laughed. “All this is conditional, everything is relative, all these are only forms,” he thought briefly, with only one edge of his thought, and he himself was trembling with his whole body, “after all, he’s wearing it! After all, he ended up by putting on! "" Laughter, however, immediately gave way to despair. ""No, not able to ..."" - he thought. His legs were trembling. Fear, he muttered to himself. My head was spinning and aching from the heat. “This is a trick! It is they who want to lure me with cunning and suddenly knock me down on everything, ”he continued to himself, going out onto the stairs. ""The bad thing is that I am almost delirious ... I can lie some stupidity ...""","“When has this ever happened before? I have no dealings with the police at all! And why exactly today?” he wondered in painful confusion. “Oh, Lord, let it end soon!” He was about to throw himself onto his knees to pray, but then he started laughing, not at the idea of prayer, but at himself. He began dressing hurriedly. A thought suddenly occurred to him: “If I’m done for, then so be it, it doesn’t matter! I’ll put on my sock! It’ll get dirty in the dust, and the traces will vanish.” But as soon as he put it on, he tore it off in disgust and horror. When he realized that he had no other sock, he put it back on again—and started laughing once more. “All this is so ordinary, it’s all relative, all purely form.” That thought occurred to him just in passing, merely at the far edge of his mind, while his entire body was trembling. “But I did put it on! All the same, I put it on!” His laughter, however, was immediately replaced by despair. “No, this is more than I can bear,” he thought. His legs were shaky—“Out of fear,” he muttered to himself. His head was spinning and aching from the fever. “It’s a trick! They want to entrap me with their guile and then, all of a sudden, throw me off guard,” he continued muttering to himself as he headed out onto the stairs. “The bad thing is that I’m almost delirious. . . . I might utter some stupid lie . . .”","‘Whatever can it mean? I’ve never had any business of my own with the police! And why today of all days?’ he thought in a torment of doubt. ‘Oh Lord, if only it was over!’ He almost fell to his knees in prayer, but burst out laughing—not at his prayer, but at himself. Hurriedly he began dressing. ‘If I’m done for, I’m done for, who cares! I have to put on the sock!’ he suddenly thought. ‘It’ll get even dirtier in the dust, and the traces will vanish.’ But as soon as he had put it on, he tore it straight off again with horror and revulsion. Having pulled it off, he realized that he didn’t have another one, so he picked it up and put it on again—and laughed once more. ‘All this is just convention, it’s all relative, all meaningless,’ he thought for an instant, with no more than a corner of his mind, while his whole body trembled. ‘There, I’ve put it on! I ended up putting it on!’ But his laughter at once gave way to despair. ‘ No, I can’t take it…’ he thought. His legs were shaking. ‘From terror,’ he muttered to himself. His head was spinning and aching from his fever. ‘It’s a trick! They want to lead me on, and suddenly catch me out,’ he went on to himself as he stepped out onto the staircase. ‘The trouble is, I’m almost delirious… I might do something stupid…’","“But when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with the police! And why just today?” he thought in agonizing bewilderment. “Good God, just get it over with as soon as possible!” He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into laughter—not at the idea of prayer, but at himself. He began to dress himself hurriedly. “If I’m lost, I’m lost, I don’t care! Shall I put the sock on?” he suddenly wondered. “It will get even dustier and the traces will be gone.” But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing and horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks, he picked it up and put it on again—and again he laughed. “That’s all conventional, that’s all relative, just a way of looking at it,” he thought in a flash, but only on the surface of his mind, while he was shuddering all over. “There, I’ve got it on! I’ve actually managed to get it on!” But his laughter was quickly followed by despair. “No, it’s too much for me . . . ” he thought. His legs shook. “Fear,” he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. “It’s a trick! They want to decoy me and confuse me about everything,” he mused, as he went out onto the stairs. “The worst of it is I’m almost light-headed . . . I may blurt out something stupid . . . ”"

"– Это не совсем так у меня, – начал он просто и скромно. – Впрочем, признаюсь, вы почти верно ее изложили, даже, если хотите, и совершенно верно… (Ему точно приятно было согласиться, что совершенно верно.) Разница единственно в том, что я вовсе не настаиваю, чтобы необыкновенные люди непременно должны и обязаны были творить всегда всякие бесчинства, как вы говорите. Мне кажется даже, что такую статью и в печать бы не пропустили. Я просто-запросто намекнул, что «необыкновенный» человек имеет право… то есть не официальное право, а сам имеет право разрешить своей совести перешагнуть… через иные препятствия, и единственно в том только случае, если исполнение его идеи (иногда спасительной, может быть, для всего человечества) того потребует. Вы изволите говорить, что статья моя неясна; я готов ее вам разъяснить, по возможности. Я, может быть, не ошибусь, предполагая, что вам, кажется, того и хочется; извольте-с. По-моему, если бы Кеплеровы и Ньютоновы открытия, вследствие каких-нибудь комбинаций, никоим образом не могли бы стать известными людям иначе как с пожертвованием жизни одного, десяти, ста и так далее человек, мешавших бы этому открытию или ставших бы на пути как препятствие, то Ньютон имел бы право, и даже был бы обязан… устранить этих десять или сто человек, чтобы сделать известными свои открытия всему человечеству. Из этого, впрочем, вовсе не следует, чтобы Ньютон имел право убивать кого вздумается, встречных и поперечных, или воровать каждый день на базаре. Далее, помнится мне, я развиваю в моей статье, что все… ну, например, хоть законодатели и установители человечества, начиная с древнейших, продолжая Ликургами, Солонами, Магометами,[42] Наполеонами и так далее, все до единого были преступниками, уже тем одним, что, давая новый закон, тем самым нарушали древний, свято чтимый обществом и от отцов перешедший, и, уж конечно, не останавливались и перед кровью, если только кровь (иногда совсем невинная и доблестно пролитая за древний закон) могла им помочь. Замечательно даже, что большая часть этих благодетелей и установителей человечества были особенно страшные кровопроливцы. Одним словом, я вывожу, что и все, не то что великие, но и чуть-чуть из колеи выходящие люди, то есть чуть-чуть даже способные сказать что-нибудь новенькое, должны, по природе своей, быть непременно преступниками, – более или менее, разумеется. Иначе трудно им выйти из колеи, а оставаться в колее они, конечно, не могут согласиться, опять-таки по природе своей, а по-моему, так даже и обязаны не соглашаться. Одним словом, вы видите, что до сих пор тут нет ничего особенно нового. Это тысячу раз было напечатано и прочитано. Что же касается до моего деления людей на обыкновенных и необыкновенных, то я согласен, что оно несколько произвольно, но ведь я же на точных цифрах и не настаиваю. Я только в главную мысль мою верю. Она именно состоит в том, что люди, по закону природы, разделяются вообще на два разряда: на низший (обыкновенных), то есть, так сказать, на материал, служащий единственно для зарождения себе подобных, и собственно на людей, то есть имеющих дар или талант сказать в среде своей новое слово. Подразделения тут, разумеется, бесконечные, но отличительные черты обоих разрядов довольно резкие: первый разряд, то есть материал, говоря вообще, люди по натуре своей консервативные, чинные, живут в послушании и любят быть послушными. По-моему, они и обязаны быть послушными, потому что это их назначение, и тут решительно нет ничего для них унизительного. Второй разряд, все преступают закон, разрушители, или склонны к тому, судя по способностям. Преступления этих людей, разумеется, относительны и многоразличны; большею частию они требуют, в весьма разнообразных заявлениях, разрушения настоящего во имя лучшего. Но если ему надо, для своей идеи, перешагнуть хотя бы и через труп, через кровь, то он внутри себя, по совести, может, по-моему, дать себе разрешение перешагнуть через кровь, – смотря, впрочем, по идее и по размерам ее, – это заметьте. В этом только смысле я и говорю в моей статье об их праве на преступление. (Вы припомните, у нас ведь с юридического вопроса началось.) Впрочем, тревожиться много нечего: масса никогда почти не признает за ними этого права, казнит их и вешает (более или менее) и тем, совершенно справедливо, исполняет консервативное свое назначение, с тем, однако ж, что в следующих поколениях эта же масса ставит казненных на пьедестал и им поклоняется (более или менее). Первый разряд всегда – господин настоящего, второй разряд – господин будущего. Первые сохраняют мир и приумножают его численно; вторые двигают мир и ведут его к цели. И те и другие имеют совершенно одинаковое право существовать. Одним словом, у меня все равносильное право имеют, и – vive la guerre éternélle,[43] – до Нового Иерусалима, разумеется!","“It’s not exactly like that with me,” he began simply and modestly. - However, I confess that you have stated it almost correctly, even, if you like, and quite correctly ... (It was certainly pleasant for him to agree that it was absolutely true.) The only difference is that I do not insist that extraordinary people were always doing all sorts of atrocities, as you say. It even seems to me that such an article would not have been missed in print. I simply hinted that an ""extraordinary"" person has the right ... that is, not an official right, but he himself has the right to allow his conscience to step over ... other obstacles, and only if the implementation of his idea (sometimes saving, maybe , for all mankind) will require it. You deign to say that my article is unclear; I am ready to explain it to you, if possible. I may not be mistaken in assuming that you seem to want that; please, sir. In my opinion, if the Keplerian and Newtonian discoveries, due to some combinations, could in no way become known to people except with the sacrifice of the life of one, ten, a hundred, and so on, people who would interfere with this discovery or would stand in the way as obstacle, then Newton would have had the right, and even would have been obliged ... to eliminate these ten or one hundred people in order to make his discoveries known to all mankind. From this, however, it does not at all follow that Newton had the right to kill anyone he pleases, oncoming and transverse, or to steal every day in the market. Further, I remember, I develop in my article that all ... well, for example, even though the legislators and establishers of mankind, starting with the most ancient, continuing with the Lycurgs, Solons, Mohammeds, [42] Napoleons and so on, every one and every one were criminals, already those who, by giving a new law, thereby violated the ancient one, sacredly revered by society and passed from the fathers, and, of course, did not stop at blood, if only blood (sometimes completely innocent and valiantly shed for the ancient law) could help them . It is even remarkable that most of these benefactors and founders of mankind were especially terrible bloodsheders. In a word, I deduce that everyone, not only great, but also a little bit out of the rut, that is, even a little bit capable of saying something new, must, by their nature, be sure to be criminals - more or less, of course. Otherwise, it is difficult for them to get out of the rut, and, of course, they cannot agree to remain in the rut, again by their nature, and in my opinion, they are even obliged to disagree. In a word, you see that so far there is nothing particularly new here. It has been typed and read a thousand times. As for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I agree that it is somewhat arbitrary, but I do not insist on exact figures. I only believe in my main idea. It consists precisely in the fact that people, according to the law of nature, are generally divided into two categories: into the lowest (ordinary), that is, so to speak, into the material that serves only for the generation of their own kind, and actually into people, that is, those who have the gift or the talent to say a new word in one's environment. The subdivisions here, of course, are endless, but the distinguishing features of both categories are rather sharp: the first category, that is, the material, generally speaking, people are by nature conservative, orderly, live in obedience and love to be obedient. In my opinion, they are obliged to be obedient, because this is their appointment, and there is absolutely nothing humiliating for them. The second category, all break the law, destroyers, or are inclined to do so, judging by their abilities. The crimes of these people are, of course, relative and varied; for the most part they demand, in very varied statements, the destruction of the present in the name of the better. But if, for his idea, he needs to even step over a corpse, over blood, then he, in his conscience, can, in my opinion, give himself permission to step over blood - depending, however, on the idea and size her, mind you. It is in this sense alone that I speak in my article of their right to crime. (Remember, we started with a legal question.) However, there is nothing to worry about: the masses almost never recognize this right for them, execute them and hang them (more or less), and in this way, quite rightly, fulfill their conservative appointment, with however, that in the next generations the same mass puts the executed on a pedestal and worships them (more or less). The first category is always the master of the present, the second category is the master of the future. The former preserve the world and multiply it numerically; the second move the world and lead it to the goal. Both have exactly the same right to exist. In a word, everyone has an equal right with me, and - vive la guerre éternelle,[43] - until the New Jerusalem, of course!","“That’s not exactly what I said,” he began simply and modestly. “However, I confess that you stated it almost correctly, even, if you like, completely correctly. . . .” (He found it very pleasant to agree that it was completely correct.) “The only difference is that I don’t insist in any way that extraordinary people absolutely must and are always obligated to commit all sorts of outrages, as you say. It even seems to me that such an article wouldn’t be accepted for publication. I merely imply that the ‘extraordinary man’ has the right . . . that is, not the official right, but he himself has the right to permit his conscience to overstep . . . various obstacles, and only in the case that the execution of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, one that would benefit all mankind) requires it. You say that my article was unclear; I’m prepared to explain it to you, as best I can. Perhaps I’m not mistaken in assuming that you’d like me to; if you please, sir. In my opinion, if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could in no way have become known to people other than through the sacrifice of the lives of one, ten, a hundred, and so on, people who interfered with their discoveries or who were obstacles blocking their way, then Newton had the right, and was even obligated to . . . eliminate those ten or a hundred people in order to make his discoveries known to all humanity. From this it in no way follows that Newton had the right to kill anyone and everyone he pleased, or to rob people every day at the market. Furthermore, I recall, I develop the idea in my article, that all people . . . at least the lawgivers and trailblazers of humanity, beginning with the ancients, continuing with Lycurgus, the Solons, Mohammeds, Napoleons, and so forth, each and every one of them, were criminals, just by virtue of the fact that in propagating new laws, they were at the same time destroying the old laws viewed as sacred by society and handed down by their fathers. Of course, they didn’t hesitate even to shed blood, if that blood (sometimes completely innocent and valiantly shed in defense of the old laws) would help them. It’s even noteworthy that a majority of these benefactors and trailblazers of humanity were particularly horrible shedders of blood. In a word, I conclude that everyone, not only the great people, but even those who stand out just slightly from the everyday rut, that is, those who are even marginally capable of uttering some new word, must, by their nature, necessarily be criminals—more or less, it goes without saying. Otherwise it would be difficult for them to break out of the rut, and, of course, they can’t agree to remain in the rut, again, by their very nature; but in my opinion, they’re even obligated not to agree to stay there. In a word, you see that up to this point there’s nothing particularly new in what I say. This has all been written and read a thousand times. Regarding my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I agree that it’s somewhat arbitrary, but I’m not insisting on exact numbers. I merely believe in my main idea. It consists precisely in the view that by the laws of nature, people are divided in general into two categories: the lower category (ordinary), that is, so to speak, material serving solely for the purpose of reproducing the species, and into people proper, that is, those who possess the gift or talent of uttering some new word in their milieu. Subdivisions here are naturally endless, but the notable characteristics of both categories are rather distinct: the first category, that is, the material, speaking in general, consists of conservative people by nature, well-behaved, who live in obedience and like being obedient. In my opinion, they’re even obligated to be obedient because that’s their destiny, and there’s nothing humiliating about it for them. The second category consists of people who break the law, destroyers or, judging by their abilities, those predisposed to be so. Their crimes, it goes without saying, are relative and diverse; for the most part, in extremely diverse forms they require the destruction of the present order in the name of something better. But even if it’s necessary to step over a corpse, to wade through blood in order to attain his goal, then in my opinion he may, according to his conscience, give himself permission to wade through blood, depending, however, on the nature of his idea and its dimensions—note that well. Only in that sense do I speak in my article about their right to commit a crime. (You’ll recall that we began with the legal question.) However, there’s no cause for alarm : the mass of humanity hardly ever recognizes this right; it punishes these men or hangs them (more or less), and does so with absolute justification, fulfilling its conservative function, although in succeeding generations this same mass of humanity places those very same people who were executed on a pedestal and worships them (more or less). The first category always comprises men of the present; the second, men of the future. The former preserve the world and increase its population; the latter move the world forward and lead it to its goal. Both have an equal right to exist. In a word, all men have equally strong rights, and—vive la guerre éternelle‡—until","‘That’s not quite what I said,’ he began, simply and modestly. ‘As a matter of fact, I admit it, you’ve stated it almost correctly; indeed, if you like, absolutely correctly…’ (He almost enjoyed accepting that it was absolutely correct.) ‘The only difference is that I don’t at all insist that extraordinary people are necessarily bound to commit all sorts of outrages all the time, as you put it. In fact I don’t think that such an article would have passed the censor. I merely suggested that an “extraordinary” person has the right—not the legal right, I mean, but the personal right, to allow his conscience to overstep… certain obstacles; and that only where the practical fulfilment of his idea (which might on occasion bring salvation for the whole human race) demands it. You were pleased to say that my article wasn’t clear; I’m prepared to do my best to clarify it for you. I may not be wrong in believing that you’d like me to do that. Very well. In my view, if circumstances had been such that Kepler’s and Newton’s discoveries* could not have become known to the world, otherwise than through the sacrifice of the lives of one, or ten, or a hundred or more people who were impeding those men’s discoveries or obstructing their work, then Newton would have had the right, indeed the duty… to eliminate those ten or a hundred people, in order to bring his discoveries to humanity at large. But it doesn’t at all follow that Newton had the right to kill people right and left, just as he liked, or to go stealing from the market every day. Furthermore, I seem to remember that in my article I explored the idea that all the… well, let’s say the lawgivers and leaders of men, in history, beginning from ancient times and going on by way of Lycurgus, Solon,* Mohammed, Napoleon, and so forth, were each and every one of them criminals, if only by virtue of the fact that in creating a new law they were ipso facto infringing an old one, held sacred by society and inherited from their forefathers; and of course these men didn’t hold back from shedding blood, so long as the shedding of blood served their purpose (for all that the blood was often guiltless, and was nobly shed in defence of the ancient laws). Indeed, it’s a remarkable fact that the majority of those benefactors and leaders of humanity were particularly bloodthirsty people. In a word, I deduce that all of them, not only the great ones but even those who ever so slightly diverged from the common run of humanity , I mean those who were just slightly capable of saying something new, must by their very nature be criminals—to a greater or lesser extent, of course. Without that, it would be difficult for them to stand out from the common herd; and of course they can’t consent to remain within the herd, yet again by virtue of their own nature. So they’re obliged not to accept things as they are. In short, you can see that up to this point there’s nothing particularly new. It’s been printed and read a thousand times over. As for my classification of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I grant that it’s fairly arbitrary, but after all I’m not insisting on exact figures. I merely believe in my central idea, which is that people, according to a law of nature, are generally divided into two categories: a lower one (ordinary people), which represents a material that serves solely to reproduce its own likeness; and real men, those who possess the gift or talent of saying something new in their own milieu. There are, of course, infinite numbers of possible subdivisions; but the distinctive features of the two categories are fairly well marked. The first category, that is to say the material, in general terms, consists of people who by their nature are conservative, orderly, live obedient lives and enjoy being obedient. In my opinion they’re actually compelled to obey because that’s their destiny, and there’s nothing in the least degrading for them in that. In the second category everyone breaks the law, they’re all destroyers or inclined to be destructive, depending on their capabilities. The crimes committed by these people are of course relative and very varied; most of them seek, in a wide variety of situations, to destroy what exists in the name of something better. But if, for the sake of his ideas, such a man has to step over a corpse or wade through blood, then I think he may, subject to his own conscience, permit himself to wade through blood—depending of course on the nature and magnitude of his idea; note that. It’s only in that sense that my article talks about such people’s right to commit crimes. (Remember that our discussion started from the question of legality.) Anyway, there’s no need to be too alarmed : the masses hardly ever recognize the rights of those people, they execute them and hang them (more or less), thereby quite properly fulfilling their conservative destiny; although in succeeding generations this same mass will stand its victims on a pedestal and render homage to them (more or less). The first category is always master of the present, while the second is master of the future. The first preserves the world and increases its numbers, the second moves it forward towards its goal. Both categories have an absolutely equal right to exist. In short, as I see it, everyone possesses equal rights, and—vive la guerre éternelle!","“That wasn’t quite what I said,” he began simply and modestly. “But I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps even perfectly.” (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) “The only difference is that I don’t contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt whether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an ‘extraordinary’ man has the right . . . that is not an official right, but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep . . . certain obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfillment of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity). You say that my article isn’t definite; I am ready to make it as clear as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred, or more people, Newton would have had the right, would in fact have been duty bound . . . to eliminate a dozen or a hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people right and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I maintain in my article that all . . . well, legislators and leaders, such as Lycurgus, Solon,32 Muhammed, Napoleon, and so on, were all without exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either, if that bloodshed—often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defense of ancient law—were of use to their cause. It’s remarkable, in fact, that the majority, in fact, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great people or even people who are slightly uncommon, that is to say capable of producing some new idea, must by nature be criminals—more or less, of course. Otherwise it’s hard for them to get out of the common rut; and to remain in the common rut is what they can’t submit to, from their very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, in fact, to submit to it. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that it’s somewhat arbitrary, but I don’t insist upon exact numbers. I only believe in my leading idea that men are in general divided by a law of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say, material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have the gift or the talent to produce something new. There are, of course, innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both categories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally speaking, contains men who are conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty to be controlled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing humiliating in it for them. The second category transgresses the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied; for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake of the better. But if such people are forced for the sake of their ideas to step over a corpse or wade through blood they can, I maintain, find within themselves, in their conscience, a justification for wading through blood—which, you should note, depends on the idea and its dimensions. It’s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article (you remember it began with the legal question). There’s no need for such anxiety , however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so quite justly fulfill their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or less). The first category is always the man of the present, the second the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me—and I hope eternal war flourishes—until the New Jerusalem, of course!”"

"– Врешь ты, деловитости нет, – вцепился Разумихин. – Деловитость приобретается трудно, а с неба даром не слетает. А мы чуть не двести лет как от всякого дела отучены… Идеи-то, пожалуй, и бродят, – обратился он к Петру Петровичу, – и желание добра есть, хоть и детское; и честность даже найдется, несмотря на то, что тут видимо-невидимо привалило мошенников, а деловитости все-таки нет!

One can even find integrity, in spite of all the swindlers who’ve turned up among us, but there’s still no efficacy! Effective people are nowhere to be seen.”","‘Nonsense, that’s not a pragmatic approach at all,’ Razumikhin objected. ‘ That’s a hard thing to acquire, and it doesn’t come down to us from heaven above. We lost the knack of doing anything pragmatic almost two hundred years ago… Of course there are new ideas bubbling up, I grant you,’ he said to Piotr Petrovich, ‘and a longing for goodness, though it’s a childish one; and you’ll find honesty too, in spite of the hordes of swindlers who’ve descended on us from all sides. But there’s still no pragmatic approach at all. Pragmatism wears smart boots.’","There’s no practicality.” Razumikhin flew at him. “Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from heaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from all practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,” he said to Peter Petrovich, “and desire for good exists, though it’s in a childish form, and honesty you may find, although there are people who hijack it. Anyway, there’s no practicality."

"Не более как минут через пять вскочил он снова и тотчас же, в исступлении, опять кинулся к своему платью. «Как это мог я опять заснуть, тогда как ничего не сделано! Так и есть, так и есть: петлю под мышкой до сих пор не снял! Забыл, об таком деле забыл! Такая улика!» Он сдернул петлю и поскорей стал разрывать ее в куски, запихивая их под подушку в белье. «Куски рваной холстины ни в каком случае не возбудят подозрения; кажется, так, кажется, так!» – повторял он, стоя среди комнаты, и с напряженным до боли вниманием стал опять высматривать кругом, на полу и везде, не забыл ли еще чего-нибудь? Уверенность, что все, даже память, даже простое соображение оставляют его, начинала нестерпимо его мучить. «Что, неужели уж начинается, неужели это уж казнь наступает? Вон, вон, так и есть!» Действительно, обрезки бахромы, которую он срезал с панталон, так и валялись на полу, среди комнаты, чтобы первый увидел! «Да что же это со мною!» – вскричал он опять как потерянный.","Not more than five minutes later he jumped up again and immediately, in a frenzy, again rushed to his dress. “How could I fall asleep again, when nothing was done! So it is, so it is: I still haven't removed the loop under my arm! I forgot, I forgot about such a thing! Such evidence!

"" - he repeated, standing in the middle of the room, and with painfully strained attention began to look around again, on the floor and everywhere, did he forget something else? The conviction that everything, even memory, even a simple consideration left him, began to torment him unbearably. “What, is it really starting, is it really an execution coming? There, there, it is! "" Indeed, scraps of fringe, which he cut off from his trousers, were lying on the floor, in the middle of the room, for the first to see! ""But what is it with me!""

So that’s it , that’s what it is!” In fact, shreds of the fringe he had cut off his trousers were lying there on the floor in the middle of the room, so that the first person who came in would notice them! “What’s happening to me?” he cried out once again, like a lost soul.","No more than five minutes later he sprang up again, and at once in a fury rushed over to his clothes. ‘How could I have gone back to sleep again, with nothing done! And there it is, there it is— I still haven’t taken off the loop under my armpit! I’d forgotten—forgotten such a vital thing! What a damning piece of evidence!’ He ripped off the loop and began quickly tearing it to shreds, which he shoved among his linen under the pillow. ‘Some bits of torn canvas won’t ever arouse suspicion— no, I don’t think so , I don’t think so!’ he repeated, standing in the middle of the room; and with a painful effort of concentration he once again began looking around him, at the floor and everywhere, in case he’d forgotten anything else. He was becoming agonizingly tormented by the conviction that everything, even his memory, even the simple faculty of thought, was deserting him. ‘Can it really have started already, is this really the beginning of my punishment? Yes, yes, that’s exactly what it is!’ And indeed, the scraps of frayed material he had cut off his trousers were scattered about the floor in the middle of the room, ready to be found by the first comer! ‘ What on earth is wrong with me?’ he cried out again in utter bewilderment.","Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time, and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again. “How could I go to sleep again with nothing done?

Surely it isn’t my punishment coming upon me? It is!” The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them! “What is the matter with me!” he cried again, distraught."

"Оказалось потом, что в этот же вечер, часу в двенадцатом он сделал и еще один весьма эксцентрический и неожиданный визит. Дождь все еще не переставал. Весь мокрый, вошел он в двадцать минут двенадцатого в тесную квартирку родителей своей невесты, на Васильевском острове, в третьей линии, на Малом проспекте. Насилу достучался и вначале произвел было большое смятение; но Аркадий Иванович, когда хотел, был человек с весьма обворожительными манерами, так что первоначальная (хотя, впрочем, весьма остроумная) догадка благоразумных родителей невесты, что Аркадий Иванович, вероятно, до того уже где-нибудь нахлестался пьян, что уж и себя не помнит, – тотчас же пала сама собою. Расслабленного родителя выкатила в кресле к Аркадию Ивановичу сердобольная и благоразумная мать невесты и, по своему обыкновению, тотчас же приступила к кой-каким отдаленным вопросам. (Эта женщина никогда не делала вопросов прямых, а всегда пускала в ход сперва улыбки и потирания рук, а потом, если надо было что-нибудь узнать непременно и верно, например: когда угодно будет Аркадию Ивановичу назначить свадьбу, то начинала любопытнейшими и почти жадными вопросами о Париже и о тамошней придворной жизни и разве потом уже доходила по порядку и до третьей линии Васильевского острова.) В другое время все это, конечно, внушало много уважения, но на этот раз Аркадий Иванович оказался как-то особенно нетерпеливым и наотрез пожелал видеть невесту, хотя ему уже и доложили в самом начале, что невеста легла уже спать. Разумеется, невеста явилась, Аркадий Иванович прямо сообщил ей, что на время должен по одному весьма важному обстоятельству уехать из Петербурга, а потому и принес ей пятнадцать тысяч рублей серебром в разных билетах, прося принять их от него в виде подарка, так как он и давно собирался подарить ей эту безделку пред свадьбой. Особенно логической связи подарка с немедленным отъездом и непременною необходимостью прийти для того в дождь и в полночь, конечно, этими объяснениями ничуть не выказывалось, но дело, однако же, обошлось весьма складно. Даже необходимые оханья и аханья, расспросы и удивления сделались как-то вдруг необыкновенно умеренны и сдержанны; зато благодарность была выказана самая пламенная и подкреплена даже слезами благоразумнейшей матери. Аркадий Иванович встал, засмеялся, поцеловал невесту, потрепал ее по щечке, подтвердил, что скоро приедет, и, заметив в ее глазах хотя и детское любопытство, но вместе с тем и какой-то очень серьезный, немой вопрос, подумал, поцеловал ее в другой раз и тут же искренно подосадовал в душе, что подарок пойдет немедленно на сохранение под замок благоразумнейшей из матерей. Он вышел, оставив всех в необыкновенно возбужденном состоянии. Но сердобольная мамаша тотчас же, полушепотом и скороговоркой, разрешила некоторые важнейшие недоумения, а именно, что Аркадий Иванович человек большой, человек с делами и со связями, богач, – бог знает что там у него в голове, вздумал и поехал, вздумал и деньги отдал, а стало быть, и дивиться нечего. Конечно, странно, что он весь мокрый, но англичане, например, и того эксцентричнее, да и все эти высшего тона не смотрят на то, что о них скажут, и не церемонятся. Может быть, он даже и нарочно так ходит, чтобы показать, что он никого не боится. А главное, об этом ни слова никому не говорить, потому что бог знает еще что из этого выйдет, а деньги поскорее под замок, и, уж конечно, самое лучшее во всем этом, что Федосья просидела в кухне, а главное, отнюдь, отнюдь, отнюдь не надо сообщать ничего этой пройдохе Ресслих и прочее и прочее. Просидели и прошептались часов до двух. Невеста, впрочем, ушла спать гораздо раньше, удивленная и немного грустная.","It turned out later that on the same evening, at about twelve o'clock, he also made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still didn't stop. All wet, he entered at twenty past twelve into the cramped apartment of his fiancée's parents, on Vasilyevsky Island, in the third line, on Maly Prospekt. I got through with force and at first there was great confusion; but Arkady Ivanovich, when he wanted to, was a man with very charming manners, so that the initial (though, by the way, very witty) guess of the prudent parents of the bride, that Arkady Ivanovich, probably, had already drunk somewhere so much that he didn’t even know himself remembers - immediately fell of itself. The relaxed parent was rolled out in an armchair to Arkady Ivanovich by the compassionate and prudent mother of the bride, and, as usual, she immediately began some distant questions. (This woman never asked direct questions, but always used, first, smiles and rubbing her hands, and then, if it was necessary to find out something without fail and correctly, for example: when Arkady Ivanovich wanted to schedule a wedding, she began with the most curious and almost greedy questions about Paris and court life there, and only then did it even reach the third line of Vasilyevsky Island.) At other times, of course, all this inspired a lot of respect, but this time Arkady Ivanovich turned out to be somehow especially impatient and flatly wished to see the bride, although he had already been informed at the very beginning that the bride had already gone to bed. Of course, the bride appeared, Arkady Ivanovich directly told her that for a while, due to one very important circumstance, he had to leave Petersburg, and therefore he brought her fifteen thousand silver rubles in different tickets, asking her to accept them from him in the form of a gift, since he I had long intended to give her this trinket before the wedding. Of course, these explanations did not show a particularly logical connection between the gift and the immediate departure and the indispensable need to come for this in the rain and at midnight, but the matter, however, turned out very smoothly. Even the necessary groans and gasps, inquiries and surprises, suddenly became unusually moderate and restrained; on the other hand, the most ardent gratitude was shown and reinforced even by the tears of a most prudent mother. Arkady Ivanovich got up, laughed, kissed the bride, patted her on the cheek, confirmed that he would arrive soon, and, noticing in her eyes, though childish curiosity, but at the same time some very serious, mute question, he thought, kissed her on the cheek. another time, and immediately sincerely annoyed in my soul that the gift would go immediately to be kept under lock and key by the most prudent of mothers. He walked out, leaving everyone in an unusually excited state. But the compassionate mother immediately, in a half-whisper and patter, resolved some of the most important perplexities, namely, that Arkady Ivanovich was a big man, a man with business and connections, a rich man - God knows what was in his head, he thought of it and went, thought of money gave, and therefore, there is nothing to marvel at. Of course, it is strange that he is all wet, but the English, for example, are even more eccentric, and all these high-tones do not look at what they say about them, and do not stand on ceremony. Maybe he even walks like that on purpose to show that he is not afraid of anyone. And most importantly, don’t say a word about this to anyone, because God knows what else will come of it, and the money will be locked up as soon as possible, and, of course, the best thing about all this is that Fedosya sat in the kitchen, and most importantly, by no means, by no means , it is by no means necessary to report anything to this rogue Resslich and so on and so forth. We sat and whispered until two o'clock. The bride, however, went to bed much earlier, surprised and a little sad.","It turned out that around twelve o’clock that same evening he made one more extremely eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still hadn’t ended. Soaked to the skin, at twenty minutes past eleven he called at the crowded apartment of his fiancée’s parents on Vasilievsky Island, at the corner of Malyi Prospect and the Third Line. He knocked at the door for a long time, until they opened it, and at first created a great deal of commotion; but Arkady Ivanovich, when he wanted to be, was a man of extremely charming manners, so that the sensible surmise of his fiancée’s parents—namely, that Arkady Ivano­vich, most likely, had gotten so drunk somewhere that he didn’t even know what he was doing—was easily dispelled. The tenderhearted and sensible mother of Arkady Ivanovich’s fiancée pushed her husband’s wheelchair out to him, and, as was her custom, immediately began with some remote questions. (This woman never asked direct questions, but always began first with smiles and hand rubbing, and then, if she needed to find out something for sure—for example, when might it suit Arkady Ivanovich to set the date for the wedding—she would begin with the most peculiar and almost excited questions about Paris and local court life, and only then would she get to the Third Line of Vasilievsky Island.) At any other time, of course, all of this would inspire much respect, but this time Arkady Ivanovich seemed to be particularly impatient and emphatically wanted to see his fiancée, even though they had informed him earlier that she had already gone to bed. Naturally, his fiancée appeared. Arkady Ivanovich told her directly that he was obliged to leave Petersburg for an extremely important reason, and therefore he had brought her fifteen thousand silver rubles, in bills of various denominations, asking her to accept them from him in the form of a gift, since he had long been planning to give her this trifling sum before their wedding. The particular logical connection of this gift with his imminent departure and the urgent necessity of coming at midnight in the rain, of course, was not at all apparent from this explanation; however, the whole affair proceeded extremely smoothly. Even the inevitable exclamations and sighs, interrogations and astonishment, suddenly were all unusually moderate and restrained; on the other hand, the most enthusiastic gratitude was expressed and even accompanied with tears by the fiancée’s most sensible mother. Arkady Ivanovich stood up, began laughing, kissed his fiancée, patted her cheek, and assured her that he would return soon; having observed in her eyes some childish curiosity, combined with a very serious, unspoken question, he thought for a bit, kissed her a second time, and sincerely felt some annoyance in his soul that his gift would immediately be locked away for safekeeping by this most sensible of mothers. He went out, leaving everyone in an unusually excited state. But the tenderhearted mama immediately began in a low voice and rapid speech to resolve certain important quandaries, namely, that Arkady Ivanovich was an important man, a man of affairs and connections, a wealthy man—God knows what he had in mind; he might up and leave, might give away money, and, therefore, there was no reason to be surprised. Of course, it was strange that he was so wet, but Englishmen, for example, are even more eccentric, and all these smart types don’t care what others say about them and don’t stand on ceremony. Perhaps he’d even come like that on purpose, to show that he wasn’t afraid of anyone. The main thing was, not to say a word about this to anyone, because God knows what would come of it, and to lock the money away at once, and, of course, the best thing of all was that Fedosya was still in the kitchen, and the primary thing was that nothing, nothing, not one thing should be communicated to that rascal Resslikh, and so on and so forth. They sat there and whispered until around two o’clock in the morning. The fiancée, however, had gone to bed much earlier, in a state of surprise and somewhat glum.","It later turned out that on that same evening, after eleven o’clock, he had made yet another highly eccentric and unexpected visit. It was still raining. At twenty past eleven he arrived, wet through, at the tiny flat occupied by the parents of his fiancée on Vasilievsky Island, at the corner of the Third Line and Maly Prospekt. * He knocked and knocked and eventually was let in, causing great embarrassment at first. But Arkady Ivanovich could behave with delightful manners when he chose, so that he quickly dispelled the sensible parents’ initial supposition—quite a perceptive one too—that he’d managed to drink himself so silly that he had no idea what he was doing. The bride’s kind-hearted and sensible mother wheeled out her enfeebled husband in his armchair to greet Arkady Ivanovich, and then, as was her way, started making conversation about all kinds of irrelevant topics. (This woman would never ask a question directly, but always started by smiling and rubbing her hands, and then, supposing she needed a firm and definite answer—for instance about the date which Arkady Ivanovich would like for the wedding—she would launch into curious and eager questions about Paris and court life there, before eventually going on to mention the Third Line and Vasilievsky Island.) On another occasion, all of this would of course have inspired great respect, but this time Arkady Ivanovich turned out to be somehow particularly impatient, and abruptly demanded to see his fiancée, although he had been told as soon as he arrived that she’d already gone to bed. Needless to say, the bride made her appearance. Arkady Ivanovich told her straight out that he had to leave Petersburg for a while on some very important business, and had therefore brought her various banknotes to the value of fifteen thousand silver roubles, which he requested her to accept from him as a gift, since he had long intended to give her this trifling present before their wedding. Of course these explanations failed to demonstrate any particular logical connection between the gift and his imminent departure, nor any absolute need for him to turn up in the pouring rain in the middle of the night in order to give it; nevertheless, everything passed off very smoothly. Even the unavoidable oohs and aahs, questions and expressions of amazement, somehow turned out unusually modest and restrained; but there were the most ardent expressions of gratitude, supported by actual tears from the very sensible mother. Arkady Ivanovich stood up, laughed, kissed his bride, patted her cheek, and promised to come back soon. Then, noticing that her eyes held not only childish curiosity but also a very serious, silent enquiry, he reflected a bit and kissed her again, feeling a sincere and heartfelt regret that his gift would immediately end up locked away for safety by that most sensible of mothers. He went out, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement. The kind-hearted Mama immediately resolved some of their most pressing problems, explaining in a hurried half-whisper that Arkady Ivanovich was a great man, a man of affairs with important connections, and very rich; God knew what was in his mind; he had simply taken it into his head to go away; and simply taken it into his head to give away his money; so there was nothing to wonder at. Of course it was odd that he was wet through; but the English were even more eccentric, and all those high-class folk didn’t care what people said about them, and didn’t stand on ceremony. Perhaps he went around like that on purpose to show that he wasn’t afraid of anybody. The main thing was not to say anything to anyone about all that, because God knew what would happen next, and the money had best be locked up straight away, and of course the best of it was that Fedosia had stayed in the kitchen all this time, and the most important thing of all was not to say a word, not one word, not a single word, to that old cat Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up whispering to each other until two in the morning. But the bride went to bed long before this, puzzled and rather sad.","It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven, he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still persisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little apartment where the parents of his fiancée lived, in Third Street on Vassilyevsky Island. He knocked for some time before he was admitted, and his visit at first caused a great disturbance; but Svidrigailov could be very fascinating when he liked, so that the first and in fact very intelligent surmise of the sensible parents—that Svidrigailov had probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing—vanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see Svidrigailov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the conversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she had to ask about some detail—for instance, when Svidrigailov would like to have the wedding—she would start with interested and almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady Ivanovich seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his betrothed at once, though he had been informed to begin with that she had already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared. Svidrigailov informed her at once that very important affairs obliged him to leave Petersburg for a time, that he had therefore brought her fifteen thousand rubles and that he begged her accept them as a present from him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present before their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all came off very well; even the inevitable questions, the inevitable expressions of wonder and regret were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the other hand, the gratitude expressed was remarkably glowing and was reinforced by tears from this most sensible of mothers. Svidrigailov got up, laughed, kissed his fiancée, patted her cheek, declared he would soon come back, and noticing in her eyes, along with childish curiosity, a sort of earnest, dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of the most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidrigailov was a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great wealth—there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start off on a journey and give away money just as his fancy took him, so there was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric, and all these people of high society didn’t think about what people said and didn’t stand on ceremony. In fact, he may have come like that on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a word should be said about it, because God knows what might come of it, and the money must be locked up, and it was extremely fortunate that Fedosia, the cook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up whispering until two o’clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier, amazed and rather sorrowful."

By the way, for two days I was telling her at length about the Prussian House of Lords (because, what else is there to talk about with her?)—and all she did was sigh and sweat! But don’t start talking about love—she’s incredibly shy –show her that you can’t possibly leave her—well, that’s all there is to it. You’ll be terribly comfortable; just like home—read, sit, lie down, write. . . . You can even kiss her, but carefully . . .”","‘I didn’t lead her on at all, I might even have been led on myself, through my own stupidity; but she won’t care in the slightest whether it’s you or me, so long as someone sits by her side and sighs to her. This, brother… I can’t explain it to you; this… well, you’re good at mathematics, and you still work at it, I know… so, start telling her about integral calculus , I swear I’m not joking, I mean every word, she won’t mind in the least: she’ll gaze at you and sigh, and that’ll go on for a year on end. As a matter of fact, I once talked to her for ages, two whole days, about the Prussian House of Lords (I mean, what could one talk to her about?), and all she did was sigh and glow. Only don’t start talking about love—she’s paralytically shy; but look as if you can’t tear yourself away; well, and that’s all you need. It’s wonderfully cosy there, just like home—you can read, sit, lie down, write … You could even kiss her, if you go carefully…’","“I haven’t fascinated her; perhaps, I was fascinated myself in my idiocy. But she won’t care whether it’s you or I, so long as somebody sits beside her, sighing . . . I can’t explain it, my friend . . . look here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now . . . start teaching her integral calculus; I swear, I’m not joking, I’m serious, it’ll be all the same to her. She will gaze at you and sigh all year long. I talked to her once for two days straight about the Prussian House of Lords (you’ve got to talk about something)—she just sighed and sweated! And you can’t talk about love—she gets shy around hysterics—but just let her see you can’t tear yourself away—that’s enough. It’s really quite comfortable; you feel at home pretty quickly, you can read, sit, lie about, write. You can even try a kiss, if you’re careful.”"

"Дуня подняла револьвер и, мертво-бледная, с побелевшею, дрожавшею нижнею губкой, с сверкающими, как огонь, большими черными глазами, смотрела на него, решившись, измеряя и выжидая первого движения с его стороны. Никогда еще он не видал ее столь прекрасною. Огонь, сверкнувший из глаз ее в ту минуту, когда она поднимала револьвер, точно обжег его, и сердце его с болью сжалось. Он ступил шаг, и выстрел раздался. Пуля скользнула по его волосам и ударилась сзади в стену.

"– Пансиона, ха-ха-ха! Славны бубны за горами! – вскричала Катерина Ивановна, тотчас после смеху закатившись кашлем, – нет, Родион Романович, прошла мечта! Все нас бросили!.. А этот генералишка… Знаете, Родион Романыч, я в него чернильницей пустила, – тут, в лакейской, кстати на столе стояла, подле листа, на котором расписывались, и я расписалась, пустила да и убежала. О, подлые, подлые. Да наплевать; теперь и этих сама кормить буду, никому не поклонюсь! Довольно мы ее мучили! (Она указала на Соню.) Полечка, сколько собрали, покажи? Как? Всего только две копейки? О, гнусные! Ничего не дают, только бегают за нами, высунув язык! Ну, чего этот болван смеется? (указала она на одного из толпы). Это все потому, что этот Колька такой непонятливый, с ним возня! Чего тебе, Полечка? Говори со мной по-французски, parlez-moi francais.[69] Ведь я же тебя учила, ведь ты знаешь несколько фраз!.. Иначе как же отличить, что вы благородного семейства, воспитанные дети и вовсе не так, как все шарманщики; не «Петрушку» же мы какого-нибудь представляем на улицах, а споем благородный романс… Ах да! что же нам петь-то? Перебиваете вы всё меня, а мы… видите ли, мы здесь остановились, Родион Романыч, чтобы выбрать что петь, – такое, чтоб и Коле можно было протанцевать… потому все это у нас, можете представить, без приготовления; надо сговориться, так чтобы все совершенно прорепетировать, а потом мы отправимся на Невский, где гораздо больше людей высшего общества и нас тотчас заметят: Леня знает «Хуторок»… Только всё «Хуторок» да «Хуторок», и все-то его поют! Мы должны спеть что-нибудь гораздо более благородное… Ну, что ты придумала, Поля, хоть бы ты матери помогла! Памяти, памяти у меня нет, я бы вспомнила! Не «Гусара же на саблю опираясь» петь в самом деле! Ах, споемте по-французски «Cinq sous»![70] Я ведь вас учила же, учила же. И главное, так как это по-французски, то увидят тотчас, что вы дворянские дети, и это будет гораздо трогательнее… Можно бы даже: «Malborough s’en va-t-en guerre», так как это совершенно детская песенка и употребляется во всех аристократических домах, когда убаюкивают детей.","- Boarding house, ha-ha-ha! Glorious tambourines beyond the mountains! cried Katerina Ivanovna, coughing up immediately after laughing, “no, Rodion Romanovich, the dream is gone!” They all abandoned us!.. And this generalishka... You know, Rodion Romanych, I put an inkwell at him, - here, in the footman's room, by the way, she stood on the table, near the sheet on which they signed, and I signed, let it go and ran away. Oh, vile, vile. Don't care; now I’ll feed these myself, I won’t bow to anyone! We've tortured her enough! (She pointed to Sonya.) Polechka, how much did you collect, show me? How? Just two pennies? Oh vile! They don't give us anything, they just run after us with their tongues out! Well, what is this idiot laughing at? (she pointed to one of the crowd). This is all because this Kolya is so slow-witted, fuss with him! What do you want, Polechka? Speak to me in French, parlez-moi francais.[69] After all, I taught you, after all, you know a few phrases! .. Otherwise, how can you distinguish that you are of a noble family, well-bred children, and not at all like all organ grinders; we are not presenting some kind of “Petrushka” on the streets, but we will sing a noble romance ... Oh yes! what are we to sing? You keep interrupting me, and we ... you see, we stopped here, Rodion Romanych, to choose what to sing - such that Kolya could also dance ... because we have all this, you can imagine, without preparation; we need to come to an agreement so that everything is completely rehearsed, and then we will go to Nevsky, where there are many more people of high society and they will immediately notice us: Lenya knows “Khutorok” ... Only everything is “Khutorok” and “Khutorok”, and everyone sings it! We should sing something much more noble... Well, what did you come up with, Polya, if only you could help your mother! I have no memory, I would remember! Do not really sing ""Hussar leaning on a saber""! Oh, let's sing ""Cinq sous"" in French![70] I taught you, I taught you. And most importantly, since it is in French, they will immediately see that you are children of the nobility, and it will be much more touching ...

The grass is always greener!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, overcome by a coughing fit immediately after her laughter. “No, Rodion Romanych, that dream is gone! Everyone’s abandoned us! As for that wretched general. . . . You know, Rodion Romanych, I threw an inkwell at him. There in the servants’ quarters; it was on the table, next to the book where you sign in; so I signed in, threw the inkwell, and ran off. Oh, the vile scoundrels. But I don’t care; now I’ll feed them myself; I won’t bow down to anyone! We’ve tormented her enough!” She indicated Sonya. “Polechka, how much did we collect? Show me. What? Only two kopecks? Oh, what dreadful people! They don’t give us anything, merely chase after us with their tongues hanging out!

And the main thing, it’s in French, so people will see that you’re respectable children, and that’ll be much more poignant. . . . We could even sing ‘Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre,’# since it’s a genuine children’s song and is sung in all aristocratic homes when they’re putting the children to sleep:","‘A boarding school, ha-ha-ha! That’ll be the day!’ cried Katerina Ivanovna, laughing and instantly bursting into a volley of coughs. ‘ No, Rodion Romanich, that dream’s all over! Everyone has abandoned us!

You keep interrupting me, but we’ve… you see, Rodion Romanich, we’ve just stopped here to choose something to sing— something that even Kolia could dance to… because as you can imagine, all of this is unrehearsed; we have to settle what to perform, so we can rehearse it all properly and then we’ll go off to Nevsky Prospekt, where there are far more upper-class people and we’ll be noticed straight away. Lenia knows “My Little Farmstead”… Only we keep singing “My Little Farmstead” again and again, and everybody sings that! We have to sing something much more genteel… Well, what have you thought up, Polia? You at least might help your mother! My memory’s quite, quite gone, or I should have thought of something! After all, we can’t sing “The Hussar leaned on his sword”,* can we! Oh, let’s sing “Cinq sous” in French —I taught you that, you know I did. And the main thing is, it’s in French, so they’ll see straight away that you’re upper-class children, and that’ll make it much more moving… Or we could even do “Malbrouck s’en va-t-en guerre”, because that’s a real children’s song and it’s used as a lullaby in all the aristocratic households.","“A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. “No, Rodion Romanovich, that dream is over! Everyone has abandoned us! . . . And that general ... You know, Rodion Romanovich, I threw an ink spot at him— it happened to be standing in the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. I wrote my name, threw it at him and ran away.

You keep putting me out, but we . . . you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovich, to find something to sing and get money, something Kolia can dance to . . .

We must talk it over and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky, where there are far more people from fine society, and we shall be noticed at once.

We really can’t sing ‘An Hussar.’ Ah, let’s sing in French, ‘Cinq sous,’53 I have taught it to you, I have taught it you. And as it is in French, people will see at once that you are children from a good family, and that will be much more touching . . .

"– Ну, так вот там, так сказать, и примерчик на будущее, – то есть не подумайте, чтоб я вас учить осмелился: эвона ведь вы какие статьи о преступлениях печатаете! Нет-с, а так, в виде факта, примерчик осмелюсь представить, – так вот считай я, например, того, другого, третьего за преступника, ну зачем, спрошу, буду я его раньше срока беспокоить, хотя бы я и улики против него имел-с? Иного я и обязан, например, заарестовать поскорее, а другой ведь не такого характера, право-с; так отчего ж бы и не дать ему погулять по городу, хе-хе-с! Нет, вы, я вижу, не совсем понимаете, так я вам пояснее изображу-с: посади я его, например, слишком рано, так ведь этим я ему, пожалуй, нравственную, так сказать, опору придам, хе-хе! вы смеетесь? (Раскольников и не думал смеяться: он сидел стиснув губы, не спуская своего воспаленного взгляда с глаз Порфирия Петровича.) А между тем ведь это так-с, с иным субъектом особенно, потому люди многоразличны, и над всем одна практика-с. Вы вот изволите теперича говорить: улики; да ведь оно, положим, улики-с, да ведь улики-то, батюшка, о двух концах, большею-то частию-с, а ведь я следователь, стало быть слабый человек, каюсь: хотелось бы следствие, так сказать, математически ясно представить, хотелось бы такую улику достать, чтобы на дважды два – четыре походило! На прямое и бесспорное доказательство походило бы! А ведь засади его не вовремя, – хотя бы я был и уверен, что это он, – так ведь я, пожалуй, сам у себя средства отниму к дальнейшему его обличению, а почему? А потому что я ему, так сказать, определенное положение дам, так сказать, психологически его определю и успокою, вот он и уйдет от меня в свою скорлупу: поймет, наконец, что он арестант. Говорят вон, в Севастополе, сейчас после Альмы,[55] умные-то люди уж как боялись, что вот-вот атакует неприятель открытою силой и сразу возьмет Севастополь; а как увидели, что неприятель правильную осаду предпочел и первую параллель открывает, так куды, говорят, обрадовались и успокоились умные-то люди-с: по крайности на два месяца, значит, дело затянулось, потому когда-то правильной-то осадой возьмут! Опять смеетесь, опять не верите? Оно, конечно, правы и вы. Правы-с, правы-с! Это всё частные случаи, согласен с вами; представленный случай действительно частный-с! Но ведь вот что при этом, добрейший Родион Романович, наблюдать следует: ведь общего-то случая-с, того самого, на который все юридические формы и правила примерены и с которого они рассчитаны и в книжки записаны, вовсе не существует-с, по тому самому, что всякое дело, всякое, хоть, например, преступление, как только оно случится в действительности, тотчас же и обращается в совершенно частный случай-с; да иногда ведь в какой: так-таки ни на что прежнее не похожий-с. Прекомические иногда случаи случаются в этом роде-с. Да оставь я иного-то господина совсем одного: не бери я его и не беспокой, но чтоб знал он каждый час и каждую минуту, или по крайней мере подозревал, что я все знаю, всю подноготную, и денно и нощно слежу за ним, неусыпно его сторожу, и будь он у меня сознательно под вечным подозрением и страхом, так ведь, ей-богу, закружится, право-с, сам придет, да, пожалуй, еще и наделает чего-нибудь, что уже на дважды два походить будет, так сказать, математический вид будет иметь, – оно и приятно-с. Это и с мужиком сиволапым может произойти, а уж с нашим братом, современно умным человеком, да еще в известную сторону развитым, и подавно! Потому, голубчик, что весьма важная штука понять, в которую сторону развит человек. А нервы-то-с, нервы-то-с, вы их-то так и забыли-с! Ведь все это ныне больное, да худое, да раздраженное!.. А желчи-то, желчи в них во всех сколько! Да ведь это, я вам скажу, при случае своего рода рудник-с! И какое мне в том беспокойство, что он несвязанный ходит по городу! Да пусть, пусть его погуляет пока, пусть; я ведь и без того знаю, что он моя жертвочка и никуда не убежит от меня! Да и куда ему убежать, хе-хе! За границу, что ли? За границу поляк убежит, а не он, тем паче что я слежу да и меры принял. В глубину отечества убежит, что ли? Да ведь там мужики живут, настоящие, посконные, русские; этак ведь современно-то развитый человек скорее острог предпочтет, чем с такими иностранцами, как мужички наши, жить, хе-хе! Но это все вздор и наружное. Что такое: убежит! это форменное; а главное-то не то; не по этому одному он не убежит от меня, что некуда убежать: он у меня психологически не убежит, хе-хе! Каково выраженьице-то! Он по закону природы у меня не убежит, хотя бы даже и было куда убежать. Видали бабочку перед свечкой? Ну, так вот он все будет, все будет около меня, как около свечки, кружиться; свобода не мила станет, станет задумываться, запутываться, сам себя кругом запутает, как в сетях, затревожит себя насмерть!.. Мало того: сам мне какую-нибудь математическую штучку, вроде дважды двух, приготовит, – лишь дай я ему только антракт подлиннее… И все будет, все будет около меня же круги давать, все суживая да суживая радиус, и – хлоп! Прямо мне в рот и влетит, я его и проглочу-с, а это уж очень приятно, хе-хе-хе. Вы не верите?","- Well, so there, so to speak, and an example for the future - that is, do not think that I dare to teach you: Avon, what articles about crimes you print! No, but so, as a fact, I dare to present an example - so, for example, I consider that other, third for a criminal, well, why, I ask, will I bother him ahead of time, even if I have evidence against him had-with? I am obliged, for example, to arrest the other one as soon as possible, but the other one is not of such a nature, right, sir; so why not let him walk around the city, he-he-s! No, I see you don’t quite understand, so I’ll explain it to you more clearly, sir: if I plant him, for example, too early, then by doing this I’ll probably give him moral, so to speak, support, hehe! are you laughing? (Raskolnikov didn’t even think of laughing: he sat with his lips pressed together, never taking his inflamed gaze off Porfiry Petrovich’s eyes.) And meanwhile, it’s so, sir, especially with a different subject, because people are many-sided, and there is one practice over everything, sir. You now deign to say now: evidence; but, let’s say, it’s evidence, sir, but evidence, father, has two ends, for the most part, sir, and I’m an investigator, therefore, a weak person, I confess: I would like the investigation, so to speak, mathematically clear imagine, I would like to get such evidence, so that twice two - four was like! It would be like direct and indisputable proof! But if you plant him at the wrong time - even if I were sure that it was him - then I, perhaps, will deprive myself of the means for further denunciation of him, but why? And because I will, so to speak, give him a certain position, so to speak, psychologically determine him and calm him down, so he will leave me in his shell: he will finally understand that he is a prisoner. They say over there, in Sevastopol, now after Alma, [55] smart people were already afraid that the enemy was about to attack with open force and immediately take Sevastopol; but when they saw that the enemy preferred a correct siege and opened the first parallel, so where, they say, smart people rejoiced and calmed down: at least for two months, it means that the matter dragged on, because someday they will take a correct siege! Again laugh, again do not believe? It is, of course, you are right. Right, right, right! These are all special cases, I agree with you; The presented case is indeed a special one! But here’s what, kind Rodion Romanovich, should be observed at the same time: after all, the general case, sir, the very one for which all legal forms and rules are tried on and from which they are calculated and written down in books, does not exist at all, sir, according to the very fact that any deed, any, even, for example, a crime, as soon as it happens in reality, immediately turns into a completely special case, sir; Yes, sometimes in what: after all, it doesn’t look like anything before, sir. Precomic cases sometimes happen in this way, sir. Let me leave some gentleman all alone: don’t take him and don’t disturb him, but so that he knows every hour and every minute, or at least suspects that I know everything, all the ins and outs, and day and night I follow him, I vigilantly watch over him, and if he were consciously under my eternal suspicion and fear, then, by God, he would spin, right, sir, he would come himself, and, perhaps, he would also do something that would already resemble twice two , so to speak, it will have a mathematical form - it is pleasant, sir. This can happen with a blue-footed peasant, and even with our brother, a modern smart person, and even developed in a certain way, and even more so! Because, my dear, it is a very important thing to understand in which direction a person is developed. And nerves, sir, nerves, sir, you have forgotten them, sir! After all, all this is now sick, but thin, and irritated! .. And there is bile, bile in all of them! Why, I'll tell you, this is, on occasion, a kind of mine, sir! And what a worry I am that he walks around the city unbound! Yes, let him, let him take a walk for now, let him; I already know that he is my victim and will not run away from me anywhere! And where can he run away, hehe! Overseas, right? The Pole will run away abroad, and not he, all the more so since I am watching and taking measures. Will he run away into the depths of the fatherland, or what? Why, the peasants live there, real, old-fashioned, Russian; after all, a modernly developed person would rather prefer a prison than to live with such foreigners as our peasants, hehe! But this is all nonsense and superficial. What is it: run away! it is shaped; and the main thing is not that; not for this alone he will not run away from me, that there is nowhere to run away: he will not psychologically run away from me, hehe! What an expression! According to the law of nature, he will not run away from me, even if there was somewhere to run away. Have you seen a butterfly in front of a candle? Well, so it will all be, everything will be around me, like around a candle, spinning; freedom will not be sweet, it will begin to think, get confused, confuse itself all around, as in nets, alarm itself to death! ... And everything will be, everything will give circles around me, narrowing and narrowing the radius, and - bang! It will fly right into my mouth, and I will swallow it, sir, and this is very pleasant, he-he-he. You do not believe?","“Well, then here’s a little example for the future—that is, don’t think I’d dare to instruct you: why, just look at those articles on crime you publish! No, sir, it’s just as a fact that I dare present you with a little example—so then, if I, for instance, consider someone guilty of committing a crime , why, I ask you, would I want to alarm him prematurely, even if I had definite evidence against him, sir? For example, I’m obliged to arrest one person sooner, but someone else has a different character, sir; so why shouldn’t I let him gallivant around town, sir, ha-ha! No, I can see you don’t quite understand, so I’ll explain it to you more clearly: for instance, if I were to put him in jail too soon, then I’d be giving him moral support, so to speak, ha-ha! You’re laughing?” (Raskolnikov wasn’t even tempted to laugh: he sat there, his teeth clenched, without taking his angry gaze from Porfiry Petrovich’s eyes). “Meanwhile, that’s how it is, especially with some subjects, because people are different, sir, yet there’s only one procedure for all of them, sir. Now you’ll say, what about the evidence? Well, let’s suppose there is evidence, sir, but evidence, old boy, cuts two ways, for the most part, sir. I’m an investigator and, as a result, I confess that I’m an imperfect man : I’d like to present an investigation that is, so to speak, mathematically clear; I’d like to have evidence that is the equivalent of two times two makes four! It would be direct and incontrovertible proof! But if you lock someone up before it’s time—even if I were convinced that it was him—I might be depriving myself of the means of further exposure, and why? Because I’d be giving him a definite position, so to speak, defining him psychologically and reassuring him, and he’d retreat from me into his shell: he’d understand at last that he was being accused of the crime. They say that in Sevastopol, right after the Battle of the Alma,§ clever people were terrified that at any moment the enemy would attack with all its might and would soon capture the town; but when they saw that the enemy preferred to stage a regular siege and was digging the first row of trenches, they say that these same clever people rejoiced and felt reassured, sir: if they were going to mount a regular siege, then the affair would drag on for at least two months! You’re laughing again. You don’t believe me? Well, of course, you’re right. You’re right, sir, quite right! These are special cases, I agree with you; the example I presented is really a special case, sir! But here’s what you need to keep in mind, my dear Rodion Romanovich: the average case, sir, the one for which all these legal forms and procedures are devised, and with which they’re intended to cope and are recorded in books, doesn’t really exist at all, for the simple reason that every case, every crime, for example, as soon as it occurs in reality, immediately becomes a completely special case, sir; in fact, it’s like nothing that’s ever happened before, sir. Very amusing cases of this kind sometimes occur, sir. If I leave a particular gentleman all alone: if I don’t arrest him and don’t disturb him, but if he knows at every hour and every minute, or at least if he suspects, that I know everything, all there is to know, and that I’m following him day and night, watching him constantly, and if he feels the weight of my conscious suspicion and fear, well then, he’s absolutely certain to lose his head. He himself will come forward of his own accord, sir, and might perhaps do something that, just like two times two makes four, will provide, so to speak, mathematical clarity—that would be very nice, sir. This can happen even with a coarse peasant, all the more so with people of our ilk, a clever contemporary man who’s developed in a certain direction. For this reason, my dear boy, it’s very important to understand the direction of a person’s development. And the nerves, sir, the nerves, you’ve forgotten all about them, sir! These days everyone’s so sick, and frayed, and irritable! And they’re all so full of bile, so very full! And this, in its own way, I can tell you, sir, can be a mine of information! Why should I be upset if a person wanders around town unhindered? Let him, let him go wherever he pleases for now; I know that he’s my prey and won’t get away from me! Where could he run to, ha-ha! Abroad, or what? A Pole would go abroad, but not him, the more so since I’m following him and have taken precautions. Would he run into the depths of the countryside? But peasants live there, genuine, homespun Russian peasants; so our contemporary, a developed person, would sooner prefer prison than life with such strangers as our peasants are, ha-ha! But this is all nonsense and beside the point. What does it mean to run away? It’s a formality; it’s not the main thing. This isn’t why he doesn’t run away from me: it’s that he has nowhere to run; he won’t run away psychologically, ha-ha! What a fine little expression that is! He won’t escape from me by the law of nature, even if there was somewhere to run to. Have you seen a moth near a candle? Well, just like that he’ll circle, circle around me, like a moth around a flame; his freedom will no longer satisfy him; he’ll start thinking, become confused, leading himself all around; he’ll get tangled up in a net and worry himself to death! Even more than that, he’ll present me with some sort of mathematical proof, like two times two—if only I allow him enough time between the acts. . . . And he’ll keep on, keep circling around me, constantly narrowing the radius of his circle—and then—plop! He’ll fly right into my mouth; I’ll swallow him up, sir, and that will be very nice, sir, ha-ha-ha! You don’t believe me?”","‘Well there you are then, an example for you for the future—please don’t think I’m presuming to teach you; after all, just look at the articles you publish about crime! No, but let me just offer you a little factual example: supposing I suspect that this, that, or the other person is a criminal , well, I ask you, why should I trouble him before I need to, even if I have evidence against him? There might be one man I’d be obliged to arrest straight away; but another one could be quite a different sort of person, truly, so why not leave him free to gad about town a bit , heh-heh! No, I see you don’t quite understand, so let me give you a clearer picture. If I were to lock him up too soon, say, then I’m actually giving him a kind of moral support, heh-heh! You’re laughing?’ (Raskolnikov wasn’t dreaming of laughing: he was sitting tight-lipped, never shifting his burning gaze away from Porfiry Petrovich’s eyes.) ‘And yet that’s just how it is, particularly with a certain sort of person, because everybody’s different, and you can only be guided by experience. Now you were just talking about evidence; well, yes, evidence is all very well, but evidence, my boy, mostly points both ways; and I’m an investigator, which means I’m a weak man , I’m sorry to say; it would be nice to submit an investigation as a mathematical certainty, so to speak—it would be nice to have evidence that was as solid as twice two is four! * And looked like straight irrefutable proof! But if I lock him up before time—even if I’m certain that it’s him—then I’ll probably deprive myself of the chance to find further evidence against him. And why? Because I’ll have put him in a definite position, so to speak; I’ll have psychologically defined him and ended his suspense, and now he’ll go and withdraw into his shell —he’ll realize he’s a prisoner. They say that out in Sebastopol, just after the battle of the Alma, the intelligent people were terribly scared that the enemy was about to mount a direct assault, and would take Sebastopol straight off. But as soon as they saw the enemy had opted for a regular siege, and started digging the first lines, well, the intelligent people were delighted and reassured, so they say: the thing would drag on for two months at least, before the town could be reduced by a siege! * You’re laughing again, you still don’t believe me? Well, of course, you’re right there too. Yes, you are! Those are all special cases, I grant you; the example I just gave you is a special case, sir! But my dear Rodion Romanovich, this is what you need to realize: the general case, the very case on which all judicial formalities and regulations are based, the one for which they’ve been worked out and set down in the books—that general case doesn’t exist, for the simple reason that every case, every crime for instance, as soon as it’s actually been committed, immediately becomes an absolutely special case, sometimes a very special one indeed, like nothing that’s ever happened before. You sometimes come across extremely comic cases like that. And if I leave some particular gentleman quite alone, without pulling him in or bothering him, but making sure he knows, or at least suspects, every minute of every day, that I know all about it, every last detail, and that I’m watching him day and night, never sleeping, following his every move, and if he’s aware that he’s under constant suspicion, and terrified of it, then he’s bound to lose his head, he’ll come to me of his own accord, and probably do something more which really does look like twice two, something with the appearance of a mathematical proof. Which is very nice. That can even happen with a lumbering peasant, while as for our own kind, intelligent modern people with some level of education—it’s almost bound to! Because, my dear fellow, it’s very important to understand where a man’s education has brought him. And then his nerves, sir, his nerves—you’d quite forgotten about those! These days they’re all sick, and worn down, and frazzled!… And all the bile they’ve stored up! Let me tell you, that can sometimes be a gold mine for us! And then, why should I worry if he’s walking about the town, a free man? Let him do it, let him walk about for a while , I don’t mind; I know very well that he’s my quarry, and he won’t get away from me. Where could he run away to? Abroad, perhaps? A Pole would escape abroad, but he won’t; particularly since I’m watching him, and I’ve taken certain steps. Or run away into the depths of the country? But that’s where peasants live, real, homespun Russian peasants; your educated man of today would sooner go to jail than live with foreigners like our own peasants , heh-heh! But all that’s nonsense, it’s all superficial stuff. What does “run away” mean? That’s a formal matter, but it isn’t the point. The reason he won’t escape from me isn’t just that there’s nowhere to escape to: he can’t escape from me psychologically, heh-heh! What a wonderful expression! The laws of nature will prevent him from escaping from me, even if there was somewhere to run to. Have you ever seen a moth near a flame? Well, he’ll be constantly fluttering around me, all the time, like the moth by the flame; his freedom will grow stale on him, he’ll start wondering, and get confused, and all tangled up in a web, and worry himself to death!… And not only that: he’ll produce some kind of mathematical proof for me himself, something like twice two— so long as I leave him enough time. And he’ll keep circling and circling around me, getting closer and closer every time,—until—snap! He’ll fly straight into my jaws, and I’ll swallow him down, and that’s very nice indeed , heh-heh-heh! You don’t believe me?’","“Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future—though don’t suppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish about crime! No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if I took this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry him prematurely, even if I had evidence against him? In one case I may be bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in quite a different position, you know, so why shouldn’t I let him walk about the town a bit, he-he-he! But I see you don’t quite understand, so I’ll give you a clearer example. If I put him in prison too soon, I may very likely give him, so to speak, moral support, he-he! You’re laughing?” Raskolnikov had no intention of laughing. He was sitting with compressed lips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovich’s. “Yes, that is the case, with some types especially, for men are so different. You say evidence. Well, there may be evidence. But evidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways. I am an examining lawyer and a weak man, I confess it. I should like to make a proof, so to say, mathematically clear, I should like to make a chain of evidence such as twice two is four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof! And if I shut him up too soon—even though I might be convinced he was the man, I should very likely be depriving myself of the means of getting further evidence against him. And how? By giving him, so to speak, a definite position, I shall put him out of suspense and set his mind at rest, so that he will retreat into his shell. They say that at Sevastopol, soon after Alma,43 the clever people were in a terrible fright that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once. But when they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted, I am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months at least. You’re laughing, you don’t believe me again? Of course, you’re right, too. You’re right , you’re right. These are special cases, I admit. But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovich, the general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended, for which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at all, for the reason that every case, every crime for instance, as soon as it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a case unlike any that’s gone before. Very comic cases of that sort sometimes occur. If I leave one man completely alone, if I don’t touch him and don’t worry him, but let him know or at least suspect every moment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night, and if he is in continual suspicion and terror, he’ll be bound to lose his head. He’ll come forward of his own accord, or maybe do something which will make it as plain as twice two is four—it’s delightful. It may be so with a simple peasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a certain side, it’s a dead certainty. For, my dear fellow, it’s a very important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated. And then there are nerves , there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they are all sick, nervous and irritable! . . . And then how angry they all are! That I assure you is a regular gold mine for us. And it’s no anxiety to me, him running about the town free! Let him, let him walk about for a bit! I know well enough that I’ve caught him and that he won’t escape me. Where could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A Pole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching and have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of the country? But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants. A modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such strangers as our peasants. He-he! But that’s all nonsense, and on the surface. It’s not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is psychologically unable to escape me , he-he! What an expression! Through a law of nature he can’t escape me if he had anywhere to go. Have you seen a butterfly round a candle? That’s how he will keep circling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its attractions. He’ll begin to brood, he’ll weave a tangle round himself, he’ll worry himself to death! What’s more he will provide me with a mathematical proof—if I only give him a long enough interval . . . And he’ll keep circling round me, getting nearer and nearer and then—flop! He’ll fly straight into my mouth and I’ll swallow him, and that will be very amusing, he-he-he! You don’t believe me?”"

"– Детей я вообще люблю, я очень люблю детей, – захохотал Свидригайлов. – На этот счет я вам могу даже рассказать прелюбопытный один эпизод, который и до сих пор продолжается. В первый же день по приезде пошел я по разным этим клоакам, ну, после семи-то лет так и набросился. Вы, вероятно, замечаете, что я со своею компанией не спешу сходиться, с прежними-то друзьями и приятелями. Ну, да и как можно дольше без них протяну. Знаете: у Марфы Петровны в деревне меня до смерти измучили воспоминания о всех этих таинственных местах и местечках, в которых кто знает, тот много может найти. Черт возьми! Народ пьянствует, молодежь образованная от бездействия перегорает в несбыточных снах и грезах, уродуется в теориях; откуда-то жиды наехали, прячут деньги, а все остальное развратничает. Так и пахнул на меня этот город с первых часов знакомым запахом. Попал я на один танцевальный так называемый вечер, – клоак страшный (а я люблю клоаки именно с грязнотцой), ну, разумеется, канкан, каких нету и каких в мое время и не было. Да-с, в этом прогресс. Вдруг, смотрю, девочка лет тринадцати, премило одетая, танцует с одним виртуозом; другой пред ней визави.[84] У стенки же на стуле сидит ее мать. Ну, можете себе представить, каков канкан! Девочка конфузится, краснеет, наконец принимает себе в обиду и начинает плакать. Виртуоз подхватывает ее и начинает ее вертеть и пред нею представлять, все кругом хохочут и – люблю в такие мгновения вашу публику, хотя бы даже и канканную, хохочут и кричат: «И дело, так и надо! А не возить детей!» Ну, мне-то наплевать, да и дела нет: логично аль не логично сами себя они утешают! Я тотчас мое место наметил, подсел к матери и начинаю о том, что я тоже приезжий, что какие всё тут невежи, что они не умеют отличать истинных достоинств и питать достодолжного уважения; дал знать, что у меня денег много; пригласил довезти в своей карете; довез домой, познакомился (в какой-то каморке от жильцов стоят, только что приехали). Мне объявили, что мое знакомство и она, и дочь ее могут принимать не иначе как за честь; узнаю, что у них ни кола ни двора, а приехали хлопотать о чем-то в каком-то присутствии; предлагаю услуги, деньги; узнаю, что они ошибкой поехали на вечер, думая, что действительно танцевать там учат; предлагаю способствовать с своей стороны воспитанию молодой девицы, французскому языку и танцам. Принимают с восторгом, считают за честь, и до сих пор знаком… Хотите, поедем, – только не сейчас.","“I love children in general, I love children very much,” Svidrigailov laughed. - On this score, I can even tell you a curious episode, which is still going on. On the first day after my arrival, I went to these various sewers, well, after seven years, I just attacked. You probably notice that I am in no hurry to get along with my company, with former friends and acquaintances. Well, yes, and I will last as long as possible without them. You know: at Marfa Petrovna's in the countryside, I was tortured to death by the memories of all these mysterious places and places where who knows, he can find a lot. Damn it! The people get drunk, young people educated from inaction burn out in unrealizable dreams and dreams, mutilate in theories; from somewhere the Jews came running in, hiding the money, and everything else is debauched. So this city smelled on me from the first hours of a familiar smell. I ended up at one so-called dance evening - a terrible sewer (and I love sewers with a dirty one), well, of course, cancan, which there are none and which in my time did not exist. Yes, this is progress. Suddenly, I see a girl of about thirteen, nicely dressed, dancing with a virtuoso; another vis-a-vis before her.[84] Her mother is sitting on a chair near the wall. Well, you can imagine what a can-can is like! The girl becomes embarrassed, blushes, finally takes offense and begins to cry. The virtuoso picks her up and begins to twirl her around and imagine before her, everyone around them laughs and - I love your audience at such moments, even if it’s cancan, they laugh and shout: “That’s right, that’s how it should be! Don't bring kids!"" Well, I don’t give a damn, and it doesn’t matter: it’s logical or not logical they console themselves! I immediately marked out my place, sat down with my mother and began to say that I, too, was a newcomer, that everyone here was so ignorant, that they did not know how to distinguish true merits and have proper respect; let me know that I have a lot of money; invited to take him in his carriage; drove home, met (they are standing in some closet from the tenants, they just arrived). I was told that both she and her daughter could take my acquaintance only as an honor; I learn that they have neither a stake nor a yard, but have come to fuss about something in some kind of presence; offer services, money; I find out that they went to the evening by mistake, thinking that they really teach dancing there; I propose to contribute, for my part, to the upbringing of the young girl, the French language and dancing. They accept with delight, consider it an honor, and are still familiar ... If you want, let's go - just not now.","“I’m fond of children in general, very fond of them,” Svidrigaylov said with a laugh. “On that score, I can even tell you about a most interesting incident, one that continues up to now. On the first day after my arrival, I visited a number of foul places—well, after seven years, I threw myself into it. You’ve probably noticed that I haven’t hurried to rejoin my old pals, my former friends and acquaintances. I intend to go on without them as long as possible. You know, living in the country with Marfa Petrovna, I was tormented to death by memories of all these mysterious nooks and crannies where one can find so many things. Damn it all! Common people get drunk, educated young people having nothing to do but burn with unrealizable dreams and fantasies and deform themselves with theories; Yids have flocked here from somewhere, they hoard all the money, while all the rest lead debauched lives. That’s how this town’s affected me from the very beginning, with its familiar stench. Once I happened to find myself at a so-called dance evening—a horrible cesspool (but I do love cesspools, with all their filth); well, naturally, they performed a cancan, a dance such as there never was in my own time. Yes, sir, that’s real progress. Suddenly I look and see a girl of about thirteen , well dressed, dancing with a professional; there was another one in front of her, vis-à-vis. Her mother was sitting on a chair near the wall. Well, you can imagine what sort of cancan it was! The girl’s embarrassed, blushes, finally takes offense, and begins to cry. The expert grabs hold of her and begins to twirl her around and show off in front of her; around them everyone was laughing—I love our public at such times, even though it was our cancan public—they were laughing and shouting, ‘That’s it, that’s the way! Don’t bring children in here!’ It was all the same to me; it wasn’t any of my business: was it logical or not for them to console themselves like that! I made a decision, sat down next to her mother, and began telling her that I was a recent arrival, and saying what boors these people were, that they didn’t know how to distinguish genuine worth or to show due respect. I let her know that I had a fair amount of money; I offered to take them home in my carriage; I escorted them home and became acquainted with them (they’d just come to Petersburg and lived in some small room rented from tenants). She told me that both she and her daughter regarded my acquaintance only as an honor; I learned that they have neither house nor home, and they came here to plead for something or other from some civil servant; I offered my services and some money; I discovered that they came that evening by mistake, thinking that it was a place where they give dancing lessons. I offered to assist as best I could with the young girl’s education, arranging French and dancing lessons. They accepted my offer with enthusiasm and considered it an honor; since then we’ve been acquainted. . . . If you like, we’ll go see them—but not now.”","I like children very much,’ laughed Svidrigailov. ‘As far as that goes, I could tell you about one very curious episode—one that isn’t over yet. The very first day after I arrived here, I went to visit a few low dives—in fact, after seven long years I made straight for them. You’ve probably noticed that I’m in no hurry to take up with my own set, my old friends and acquaintances. And I’ll keep out of their way as long as I possibly can. You know, when I was living in the country with Marfa Petrovna, I was maddened by the memory of all those secret, mysterious dens and dives where a man who knows his way around can find all sorts of things. Damn it! Common folk get roaring drunk, educated young people with nothing to do burn themselves up in impossible dreams and fancies and grotesque theories; the Jews have moved in from somewhere and they’re piling money away, and everyone else gets debauched. As soon as I got here, I could feel the familiar reek of the town’s breath on my face. I landed up at what was supposed to be a dance—it was in a dreadful den ( and I like my dens to be a little bit grubby); well, obviously, they had a cancan that you’d never see anywhere else, the kind that didn’t even exist in my day. Yes, sir, that’s progress. And suddenly I noticed a little girl of thirteen or so, very sweetly dressed, dancing with a pro, and another one opposite them. And her mother sitting on a chair by the wall. Well, you can just imagine what sort of a cancan that was! The little girl was embarrassed, and blushed, and in the end she felt insulted and started to cry. The pro picked her up and started twirling her round and showing her off, everyone around was roaring with laughter, and (I love our audiences at moments like that, even our cancan audiences) they all laughed and yelled “That’s the stuff! Serves them right! Shouldn’t bring children here!” Well, what did I care, and anyway it was none of my business; whether or not it made any sense, they were there to have fun! I could see straight away what I had to do: I sat down next to the mother and started telling her that I was a newcomer there myself, and what ignorant louts all these other people were, and how they couldn’t recognize real worth or give it due respect; and mentioned that I had lots of money, and offered to take them home in my own carriage; and I did take them home, and got acquainted with them. They were living in a poky room sublet by tenants somewhere—they’d only just arrived. The mother declared that both she and her daughter could only regard their acquaintance with me as an honour. I discovered that they didn’t possess a stick or stone of their own, they’d come to town to hand in a petition at some ministry or other. I offered to help, I offered them money; the mother said that coming to that dance had all been a mistake, she’d thought there were going to be proper dancing lessons; I offered to help educate the young lady myself, and teach her French and dancing. That was enthusiastically accepted, taken as a great honour, and I’m still friendly with them… We can go and see them if you like… but not just now.’","“I am always fond of children, very fond of them,” laughed Svidrigailov. “I can tell you one curious example of this. The first day I came here I visited various places, after seven years I just rushed at them. You probably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew my acquaintance with my old friends. I shall do without them as long as I can. Do you know, when I was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thought of these places where anyone who knows his way around can find a great deal. Yes, I swear on my soul! The peasants have vodka, the educated young people, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams and visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery. From the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odors. I happened to be in a terrible den— I like my dens dirty —it was a dance, so called, and there was a cancan such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you have progress. All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely dressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one vis-à-vis. Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You can’t fancy what a cancan that was! The girl was ashamed, blushed, at last felt insulted, and began to cry. Her partner seized her and began whirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and—I like the public, even the cancan public—they laughed and shouted, ‘Serves her right—serves her right! Shouldn’t bring children!’ Well, it’s not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or not. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by her mother, and began by saying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and that they couldn’t recognize decent people and treat them with respect, let her know that I had plenty of money and offered to take them home in my carriage. I took them home and got to know them. They were staying in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the country. She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my acquaintance as an honor. I found out that they had nothing of their own and had come to town on some legal business. I offered my services and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon by mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class. I offered to assist in the young girl’s education in French and dancing. My offer was accepted with enthusiasm as an honor—and we are still friendly . . . If you like, we’ll go and see them, only not just now.”"

(Он ткнул пальцем в угол, где на маленьком столике, на жестяном блюдце, стояли остатки ужасного бифштекса с картофелем.) Кстати, обедали вы? Я перекусил и больше не хочу. Вина, например, совсем не пью. Кроме шампанского, никакого, да и шампанского-то в целый вечер один стакан, да и то голова болит. Это я теперь, чтобы подмонтироваться,[79] велел подать, потому что я куда-то собираюсь, и вы видите меня в особом расположении духа. Я потому давеча и спрятался, как школьник, что думал, что вы мне помешаете; но, кажется (он вынул часы), могу пробыть с вами час; теперь половина пятого. Верите ли, хотя бы что-нибудь было; ну помещиком быть, ну отцом, ну уланом, фотографом, журналистом… н-ничего, никакой специальности! Иногда даже скучно.

You see, in what a tavern I sit all the time, and this is my pleasure, that is, not exactly my pleasure, but so, I must sit down somewhere. Well, at least this poor Katya - have you seen it? .. Well, if I were, for example, at least a glutton, a club deli, otherwise that's what I can eat! (He pointed to the corner, where on a small table, on a tin saucer, stood the remains of a terrible steak with potatoes.) By the way, did you have lunch? I ate and don't want any more. For example, I don't drink wine at all. Except for champagne, no, and even one glass of champagne in the whole evening, and even then my head hurts. It's me now, in order to mount it, [79] ordered me to file, because I'm going somewhere, and you see me in a special mood. That's why I hid just now, like a schoolboy, because I thought that you would interfere with me; but it seems (he took out his watch) I can stay with you for an hour; now half past five.

I’ve eaten a little and don’t want any more. Wine, for example, I don’t drink at all. Except for champagne, nothing at all, and only one glass of champagne for the whole evening, and even then my head aches. I ordered it now to fortify myself because I plan to go somewhere, and you see me in a peculiar frame of mind.

See what a low dive I spend my time in, and yet I love it—well, not that I actually love it, but one has to sit somewhere. Think of that poor Katya —did you see her? If I’d been a great glutton, some sort of club gourmet… but you see the kind of food I’ll settle for!’ (He jerked his finger at a little table in the corner, where a tin dish held the remnants of a dreadful steak and some potatoes.) ‘Incidentally, have you had anything to eat? I’ve already eaten, I don’t want any more. Wine, for instance—I don’t drink it. No wine at all, except for champagne; but a single glass would last me the whole evening, and even that would give me a headache. I only ordered it just now to set myself up, because I’m off somewhere, and you find me in a very particular frame of mind.

"«Ну так что ж! И пожалуй!» – проговорил он решительно, двинулся с моста и направился в ту сторону, где была контора. Сердце его было пусто и глухо. Мыслить он не хотел.

And perhaps! - he said decisively, moved off the bridge and headed in the direction where the office was. His heart was empty and deaf. He didn't want to think.

Why not?” he said decisively; he moved away from the bridge and headed in the direction of the police station. His heart was empty and hollow. He didn’t want to think.

"– Вы, кажется, говорили вчера, что желали бы спросить меня… форменно… о моем знакомстве с этой… убитой? – начал было опять Раскольников, – «ну зачем я вставил кажется? – промелькнуло в нем как молния. – Ну зачем я так беспокоюсь о том, что вставил это кажется?» – мелькнула в нем тотчас же другая мысль как молния.","- You seem to have said yesterday that you would like to ask me ... formally ... about my acquaintance with this ... murdered woman?

"– Нет? Вы так думаете? – продолжал Свидригайлов, медленно посмотрев на него. – Ну, а что, если так рассудить (вот помогите-ка): «Привидения – это, так сказать, клочки и отрывки других миров, их начало. Здоровому человеку, разумеется, их незачем видеть, потому что здоровый человек есть наиболее земной человек, а стало быть, должен жить одною здешнею жизнью, для полноты и для порядка. Ну, а чуть заболел, чуть нарушился нормальный земной порядок в организме, тотчас и начинает сказываться возможность другого мира, и чем больше болен, тем и соприкосновений с другим миром больше, так что, когда умрет совсем человек, то прямо и перейдет в другой мир». Я об этом давно рассуждал. Если в будущую жизнь верите, то и этому рассуждению можно поверить.","- Not? You think so? continued Svidrigailov, looking slowly at him. - Well, what if we think like this (help me): “Ghosts are, so to speak, shreds and fragments of other worlds, their beginning. A healthy person, of course, has no need to see them, because a healthy person is the most earthly person, and therefore, he must live one local life, for completeness and order. Well, a little sick, a little disrupted the normal earthly order in the body, and immediately the possibility of another world begins to affect, and the more sick, the more contact with another world, so that when a person dies completely, he will go directly to another world "". I've been talking about this for a long time. If you believe in a future life, then you can believe this reasoning.","“They don’t? Is that what you think?” continued Svidrigaylov, regarding him steadily. “Well, let’s say we reason like this (help me out here!) : ‘Ghosts, so to speak, are shreds and fragments of other worlds, their beginning. A healthy person, naturally, has no need to see them because he’s primarily a being of this earth; therefore, he must live only his earthly life, for fullness’ sake and for orderliness. But if he falls slightly ill, if the normal earthly order of the organism is destroyed, then the possibility of another world begins to open up; the sicker the person, the more contact with the other world, so that when this person dies, he passes immediately into the other world.’ I started to think about this a long time ago. If you believe in a future life, then you can believe in this line of reasoning.”","‘Don’t they? You think not?’ Svidrigailov went on, taking a long look at him. ‘But supposing we were to argue this way (please help me here): “Ghosts are, as it were, the scraps and shreds of other worlds, their first beginnings. A healthy person, naturally, has no need to see them, because a healthy person is the most earth-bound kind of person, and for the sake of completeness and order he is obliged to live a purely earth-bound life. But then, as soon as he falls ill, as soon as the normal terrestrial ordering of his body is impaired, the possibility of another world begins to show itself, and the sicker he becomes, the more contact he has with the other world, so that when this person actually dies, he crosses straight over into the other world.” I’ve thought along those lines for a long time. If you believe in a life to come, you could believe this argument too.’","“No? You don’t think so?” Svidrigailov went on, looking at him deliberately. “But what do you say to this argument (come on, help me with it): ghosts are as it were shreds and fragments of other worlds, the beginning of them. A man in health has, of course, no reason to see them, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the sake of completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon as he is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is broken, he begins to realize the possibility of another world; and the more seriously ill he is, the closer becomes his contact with that other world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that world. I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you could believe in that, too.”"

"– Насчет этого нельзя заключить. Я имею известия точные. Не спорю, может быть, он способствовал ускоренному ходу вещей, так сказать, нравственным влиянием обиды; но что касается поведения и вообще нравственной характеристики лица, то я с вами согласен. Не знаю, богат ли он теперь и что именно оставила ему Марфа Петровна; об этом мне будет известно в самый непродолжительный срок; но уж, конечно, здесь, в Петербурге, имея хотя бы некоторые денежные средства, он примется тотчас за старое. Это самый развращенный и погибший в пороках человек из всех подобного рода людей! Я имею значительное основание предполагать, что Марфа Петровна, имевшая несчастие столь полюбить его и выкупить из долгов, восемь лет назад, послужила ему еще и в другом отношении: единственно ее старанием и жертвами затушено было, в самом начале, уголовное дело, с примесью зверского и, так сказать, фантастического душегубства, за которое он весьма и весьма мог бы прогуляться в Сибирь. Вот каков этот человек, если хотите знать.","“We can't conclude about that. I have accurate information. I do not argue, perhaps he contributed to the accelerated course of things, so to speak, by the moral influence of resentment; but as regards behavior and, in general, the moral characteristics of a person, I agree with you. I don't know if he is rich now, or what exactly Marfa Petrovna left him; I will be aware of this as soon as possible; but, of course, here in Petersburg, having at least some money, he will immediately fall back to his old ways. This is the most depraved and perished in the vices of a person of all such people! I have good reason to suppose that Marfa Petrovna, who had the misfortune of loving him so much and redeeming him from his debts, eight years ago, served him in another respect as well: it was only through her diligence and sacrifices that, at the very beginning, the criminal case was extinguished, with an admixture of brutal and, so to speak, fantastic murder, for which he could very, very much take a walk to Siberia. That's what this man is like, if you want to know.","“It’s impossible to arrive at a definite conclusion about that. I have accurate information. I can’t argue that perhaps he contributed to hastening the course of events, so to speak, by the moral impact of his insult; but as far as his conduct is concerned and, in general, the moral character of the person himself, I’m in agreement with you. I don’t know if he’s rich now, or how much precisely Marfa Petrovna left him; I’ll find that out in a very short time; but, of course, here in Petersburg, even having any financial resources at hand, he’ll resume his former course of action. Of all people of that kind, he’s the most depraved man and entirely devoted to vice! I have substantial grounds to assume that Marfa Petrovna, who had the misfortune of loving him and redeeming him from his debts eight years ago, was of service to him in another respect: it was only her efforts and her sacrifice that resulted in suppressing at the outset a criminal matter with an element of beastly and, so to speak, fantastical murder, for which he might very well have been sent packing to Siberia. That’s the sort of man he is, if you want to know.”","‘As to that, one cannot draw any definite conclusion. The information I have is precise. I don’t dispute that he may perhaps have hastened the course of events, by the moral effect, so to speak, of his affronts to her; but as regards this individual’s conduct, and his moral character in general, I agree with you. I don’t know whether he is rich now, nor exactly how much Marfa Petrovna left him; I shall have information on that point in the very near future; but naturally, here in Petersburg, if he has anything at all in the way of financial resources, he will immediately return to his old ways. He is the most corrupt, most depraved and vicious individual of any of his kind. I have substantial grounds for believing that Marfa Petrovna, having had the misfortune to fall so deeply in love with him that she paid off his debts eight years ago, also assisted him in a different matter; and that it was only through her efforts and sacrifices that a criminal investigation was suppressed in its very earliest stages, involving a brutal and, if one might put it that way, fantastic homicide, for which he could most, most easily have ended up on a trip to Siberia. That is the sort of man he is, if you wish to know.’","“It’s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. I do not dispute that he may have accelerated the course of events by the moral influence, so to say, of the offence; but as to his general conduct and moral characteristics, I agree with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within a very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any financial resources, he will lapse at once into his old habits. He is the most vicious, depraved specimen of that particular type. I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was unfortunate enough to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years ago, was also of service to him in another way. Solely by her exertions and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to Siberia, was hushed up. That’s the sort of man he is, if you care to know.”"
"– Сударыня! Сударыня! – восклицал он внушительным голосом, – до вас этот факт не касается! Никто не решится вас обвинить в умысле или в соглашении, тем паче что вы же и обнаружили, выворотив карман: стало быть, ничего не предполагали. Весьма и весьма готов сожалеть, если, так сказать, нищета подвигла и Софью Семеновну, но для чего же, мадемуазель, вы не хотели сознаться? Позора убоялись? Первый шаг? Потерялись, может быть? Дело понятное-с; очень понятное-с… Но, однако, для чего же было пускаться в такие качества! Господа! – обратился он ко всем присутствующим, – господа! Сожалея и, так сказать, соболезнуя, я, пожалуй, готов простить, даже теперь, несмотря на полученные личные оскорбления. Да послужит же, мадемуазель, теперешний стыд вам уроком на будущее, – обратился он к Соне, – а я дальнейшее оставлю втуне и, так и быть, прекращаю. Довольно!","- Madame! Madam! he exclaimed in an impressive voice, “this fact does not concern you! No one will dare to accuse you of intent or agreement, all the more so as you found out when you turned your pocket inside out: therefore, you did not assume anything. I am very, very ready to regret if, so to speak, poverty inspired Sofya Semyonovna too, but why, mademoiselle, did you not want to confess? Are you afraid of shame? First step? Lost, maybe? It's understandable, sir; very understandable, sir... But, however, why indulge in such qualities! Lord! he addressed everyone present, “gentlemen! Regretting and, so to speak, condoling, I am perhaps ready to forgive, even now, despite the personal insults received. May the present shame serve you as a lesson for the future, mademoiselle, - he turned to Sonya, - and I will leave the rest in vain and, so be it, I will stop. Enough!","“Madam! Madam!” he cried in an imposing voice. “This matter doesn’t involve you! No one will accuse you of having the intention or of complicity, especially since it was you who discovered the banknote by turning her pockets inside out, which means you had no idea of it beforehand. I’m absolutely prepared to sympathize, if, so to speak, it was poverty that incited Sofiya Semyonovna. But why, mademoiselle, didn’t you want to confess? Were you afraid of the disgrace? Was it your first time? Did you become flustered, perhaps? It’s understandable, ma’am, completely understandable, ma’am. . . . But why did you embark on such a course? Ladies and gentlemen!” He turned to everyone present. “Ladies and gentlemen! Sympathizing and, so to speak, pitying, I may be ready to forgive, even now, in spite of the personal insults I’ve received. And let your present shame, mademoiselle, be a lesson to you for the future,” he said, turning to Sonya, “and I shall leave the matter here; so be it, I’ll stop. Enough!”","‘Madam! Madam!’ he exclaimed in impressive tones. ‘All this does not touch you! No one would dare to accuse you of planning or consenting to such a thing, particularly since it was you who found it out, when you turned out her pockets—evidently you had suspected nothing. I am most, most ready to be compassionate if it was, so to speak, destitution that motivated Sofia Semionovna too—but why, mademoiselle, would you not confess? Scared of the disgrace? The first step? Lost your head, perhaps? Understandable, most understandable… But how could you let yourself go down that path? Gentlemen!’—and he turned to the assembled company, ‘Gentlemen! I regret and, so to speak, sympathize, and am even ready to forgive, even now, despite the personal insults heaped on me. But,’ turning to Sonia, ‘may your present shame, mademoiselle, serve as a lesson to you for the future. And now I shall leave it at that— so be it, the matter is closed. Enough!’","“Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!” he cried impressively, “no-one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an instigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved her guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous idea of it. I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty, so to speak, drove Sofia Semionovna to it, but why did you refuse to confess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step? You lost your head, perhaps? One can quite understand it . . . But how could you have lowered yourself to such an action? Gentlemen,” he addressed the whole company, “gentlemen! Compassionate and so to say commiserating with these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spite of the personal insult lavished upon me! And may this disgrace be a lesson to you for the future,” he said, addressing Sonia, “and I will carry the matter no further. Enough!”"
"А Свидригайлов между тем ровнехонько в полночь переходил через – ков мост по направлению на Петербургскую сторону. Дождь перестал, но шумел ветер. Он начинал дрожать и одну минуту с каким-то особенным любопытством и даже с вопросом посмотрел на черную воду Малой Невы. Но скоро ему показалось очень холодно стоять над водой; он повернулся и пошел на – ой проспект. Он шагал по бесконечному – ому проспекту уже очень долго, почти с полчаса, не раз обрываясь в темноте на деревянной мостовой, но не переставал чего-то с любопытством разыскивать по правой стороне проспекта. Тут где-то, уже в конце проспекта, он заметил, как-то проезжая недавно мимо, одну гостиницу деревянную, но обширную, и имя ее, сколько ему помнилось, было что-то вроде Адрианополя. Он не ошибся в своих расчетах: эта гостиница в такой глуши была такою видною точкой, что возможности не было не отыскать ее, даже среди темноты. Это было длинное деревянное почерневшее здание, в котором, несмотря на поздний час, еще светились огни и замечалось некоторое оживление. Он вошел и у встретившегося ему в коридоре оборванца спросил нумер. Оборванец, окинув взглядом Свидригайлова, встряхнулся и тотчас же повел его в отдаленный нумер, душный и тесный, где-то в самом конце коридора, в углу, под лестницей. Но другого не было; все были заняты. Оборванец смотрел вопросительно.","And Svidrigailov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge in the direction of the Petersburg side. The rain had stopped, but the wind was blowing. He began to tremble, and for a minute with some kind of special curiosity and even with a question looked at the black water of the Malaya Neva. But soon it seemed very cold to him to stand above the water; he turned and went to - oh avenue. He walked along the endless avenue for a very long time, almost half an hour, more than once breaking off in the darkness on a wooden pavement, but did not stop looking for something with curiosity on the right side of the avenue. Here, somewhere, already at the end of the avenue, he noticed, as he was passing recently, a wooden, but spacious hotel, and its name, as far as he could remember, was something like Adrianople. He was not mistaken in his calculations: this hotel in such a wilderness was such a prominent point that it was impossible not to find it, even in the darkness. It was a long blackened wooden building, in which, despite the late hour, the lights were still shining and some animation was noticed. He went in and asked a ragamuffin who he met in the corridor for a number. The ragamuffin, glancing at Svidrigailov, shook himself and immediately led him to a remote room, stuffy and cramped, somewhere at the very end of the corridor, in the corner, under the stairs. But there was no other; everyone was busy. The rogue looked questioningly.","Meanwhile, at the stroke of midnight, Svidrigaylov crossed the Tuchkov Bridge in the direction of the Petersburg Side. The rain had stopped, but the wind was still blowing. He began shivering and for a minute regarded the black water of the Little Neva with particular curiosity and even with a question in mind. But soon he felt very cold standing above the water; he turned and set off on Bolshoi Prospect. He walked along the endless prospect for a long time, almost half an hour, stumbling more than once in the darkness on the wooden sidewalk, but he didn’t cease searching for something along the right side of the prospect. Somewhere there, almost at the end of the prospect, he noticed, recently having passed by, a large wooden hotel, the name of which, as best he recalled, was something like the Adrianople. He was not mistaken in his recollections: this out-of-the-way hotel was so conspicuous that it was impossible to miss even in the darkness. It was a long dark wooden building in which, in spite of the late hour, lights were still burning and there were certain signs of life. He went in and asked the ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. This fellow looked Svidrigaylov over, roused himself, and at once showed him to a remote room, stuffy and cramped, somewhere at the far end of the corridor, in the corner under the staircase. But there was no other vacant room; all the others were occupied. The ragged fellow regarded him inquiringly.","Meanwhile, on the stroke of midnight, Svidrigailov crossed —— Bridge to the Petersburg Side. The rain had stopped, but there was still a howling wind. He was beginning to shiver; for a minute he stood staring with particular interest, indeed with a question in his mind, at the dark waters of the Little Neva. But soon he decided that it was too cold to stand staring at the water; he turned back and walked along the —— Prospekt. * He walked on along the endless avenue for a very long time, almost half an hour, stumbling here and there on the wooden pavement in the dark, and constantly searching for something along the right-hand side of the road. Somewhere towards the far end of the avenue, he had recently noticed while driving past that there was a large hotel, built of wood, which he seemed to remember was called something like Adrianople. * He was quite right—that hotel, in this derelict part of town, was such a conspicuous landmark that there was no fear of missing it even in the dark. It was a long wooden structure, black with age, and despite the late hour there were still lights burning and signs of life inside. He entered, and meeting a ragged waiter in the corridor, asked him for a room. The man cast an eye over Svidrigailov, pulled himself together and immediately led him to a tiny, stuffy little room somewhere far away at the end of the corridor, in a corner under a staircase. There was no choice; all the other rooms were taken. The ragged man looked enquiringly at him.","Meanwhile, at midnight exactly, Svidrigailov crossed the bridge on the way back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring wind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry. But he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and went towards Y____ Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side of the street. He had noticed passing through this street recently that there was a hotel somewhere near the end, built of wood, but fairly large, and its name, he remembered, was something like Adrianople. He was not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place that he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long, blackened wooden building, and although it was late there were lights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter, scanning Svidrigailov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a tiny, stuffy room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under the stairs. There was no other room; all of them were occupied. The ragged fellow looked inquiringly."

You must admit, how could anyone tell a story about “Karl from the pharmacy who from fright his heart piercing”, and how he—what a drip!—instead of tying up his coachman, “is clasping together his hands, and crying, and very much begging”! What an ass! And you know, she thinks all that’s very moving, and has no idea how stupid she is!

"На улице жара стояла страшная, к тому же духота, толкотня, всюду известка, леса, кирпич, пыль и та особенная летняя вонь, столь известная каждому петербуржцу, не имеющему возможности нанять дачу, – все это разом неприятно потрясло и без того уже расстроенные нервы юноши. Нестерпимая же вонь из распивочных, которых в этой части города особенное множество, и пьяные, поминутно попадавшиеся, несмотря на буднее время, довершили отвратительный и грустный колорит картины. Чувство глубочайшего омерзения мелькнуло на миг в тонких чертах молодого человека. Кстати, он был замечательно хорош собою, с прекрасными темными глазами, темно-рус, ростом выше среднего, тонок и строен. Но скоро он впал как бы в глубокую задумчивость, даже, вернее сказать, как бы в какое-то забытье, и пошел, уже не замечая окружающего, да и не желая его замечать. Изредка только бормотал он что-то про себя, от своей привычки к монологам, в которой он сейчас сам себе признался. В эту же минуту он и сам сознавал, что мысли его порою мешаются и что он очень слаб: второй день, как уж он почти совсем ничего не ел.","Outside, the heat was terrible, besides stuffiness, crush, everywhere lime, forests, bricks, dust and that special summer stench, so known to every Petersburger who does not have the opportunity to rent a dacha - all this at once unpleasantly shook the already frustrated nerves young men. The unbearable stench from the taverns, of which there is a special multitude in this part of the city, and the drunks who came across every minute, despite the weekday, completed the disgusting and sad coloring of the picture. A feeling of deepest disgust flashed for a moment in the thin lines of the young man. By the way, he was remarkably handsome, with beautiful dark eyes, dark Russian, above average height, thin and slender. But soon he fell into a sort of deep thoughtfulness, even, or rather, as it were, into some kind of oblivion, and went, no longer noticing his surroundings, and even unwilling to notice him. From time to time he only muttered something to himself, from his habit of monologues, which he had now confessed to himself. At that very moment he himself was aware that his thoughts sometimes got in the way and that he was very weak: the second day, as he had eaten almost nothing at all.","It was stiflingly hot outside; moreover, the stuffiness, the crush of people, lime plaster everywhere, scaffolding, bricks, dust, and that particular summer stench, so familiar to every Petersburg resident lacking the means to rent a summer dacha—all this suddenly and offensively struck the young man’s already distraught nerves. The unbearable stench of cheap taverns, which were particularly numerous in this part of the city, and the drunkards encountered constantly, despite its being a weekday, completed the repulsive and grim scene. For a moment, a feeling of the deepest loathing flashed across the young man’s delicate features. Incidentally, he was remarkably handsome, with splendid dark eyes and dark brown hair; he was taller than average, slender, and well built. But soon he seemed to slip into profound pensiveness, even, it would be more accurate to say, into a state of oblivion. He walked along not noticing his surroundings, not even wanting to take notice of them. From time to time he merely muttered something to himself, from his penchant for monologues, which he immediately acknowledged to himself. At that moment he himself was aware that at times his thoughts were confused and that he was feeling very weak: it was the second day he’d eaten hardly anything at all.","The heat outside was unbearably sultry; the streets were full of jostling crowds, there was whitewash everywhere, and scaffolding, and bricks, and dust, and that special summer stench that every inhabitant of Petersburg knows so well, if he isn’t able to rent a dacha out of town. * All this at once assailed the young man’s already shattered nerves. And the unbearable stink from the drinking dens, especially common in that part of town,* and the drunks he met at every step, although this was a working day, completed the revolting and depressing picture. An expression of profound disgust flashed across the young man’s delicate features. He was, incidentally, remarkably good-looking, with fine dark eyes and dark auburn hair, above average height, slim and well proportioned. But soon he fell into deep thought, or rather into an absent state of mind, and walked ahead without either noticing or wishing to notice his surroundings. Now and again he muttered something under his breath—being in the habit, as he now realized, of talking to himself. At this point he was also aware that his thoughts were becoming confused, and that he was very weak, having eaten almost nothing for two days.","The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle, the plaster, the scaffolding, the bricks and the dust all around him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to everyone who is unable to get out of town during the summer—all worked painfully upon the young man’s already overwrought nerves. The unbearable stench from the taverns, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it was a weekday, completed the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the deepest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon, though, he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was around him and not caring to observe it. From time to time, because he used to talk to himself, he would mutter something, a habit to which he had just confessed. At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had had almost nothing to eat."
"Тут Разумихин принялся развивать свой проект и много толковал о том, как почти все наши книгопродавцы и издатели мало знают толку в своем товаре, а потому обыкновенно и плохие издатели, между тем как порядочные издания вообще окупаются и дают процент, иногда значительный. Об издательской-то деятельности и мечтал Разумихин, уже два года работавший на других и недурно знавший три европейские языка, несмотря на то, что дней шесть назад сказал было Раскольникову, что в немецком «швах», с целью уговорить его взять на себя половину переводной работы и три рубля задатку: и он тогда соврал, и Раскольников знал, что он врет.","Here Razumikhin began to develop his project and talked a lot about how almost all of our booksellers and publishers know little about their product, and therefore usually bad publishers, while decent publications generally pay off and give a percentage, sometimes significant. Razumikhin, who had been working for others for two years and had a good knowledge of three European languages, dreamed of publishing, despite the fact that six days ago he had told Raskolnikov that there were “seams” in German, in order to persuade him to take on half of the translated work and three rubles as a deposit: and then he lied, and Raskolnikov knew that he was lying.","Razumikhin started to develop his plan; he went on at length about how all the booksellers and publishers knew very little about their own merchandise, and therefore were usually bad publishers; meanwhile, good editions generally did well and produced a profit, sometimes a considerable one. Razumikhin had been dreaming about the publishing business, having worked for two years at various places; he had a decent knowledge of three European languages, in spite of the fact that some six days ago he had told Raskolnikov that his German was “feeble,” since his aim had been to convince him to take half his translation job and three rubles in advance: he’d been lying at the time, and Raskolnikov had known that he was lying.","Here Razumikhin set about expounding his plan, talking at length about how little our booksellers and publishers understand their business, and that makes them bad publishers, while good-quality books generally sell well and yield a profit, sometimes a considerable one. It was publishing that Razumikhin had been thinking about. He had worked for other publishers for two years and had a fair knowledge of three European languages, despite having told Raskolnikov some six days ago that his German was schwach. * He had said that because he was trying to persuade him to take on half the translating work and accept an advance of three roubles; but it had been a fib, and Raskolnikov had known it.","Then Razumikhin began to unfold his project, and he explained at length that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all about what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad publishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and gain a profit, sometimes a considerable one. Razumikhin had in fact been dreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years he had been working in publishers’ offices, and knew three European languages well, though he had told Raskolnikov six days before that he was “weak” in German in order to persuade him to take half his translation and half the payment for it. He had told a lie, then, and Raskolnikov knew he was lying."
"– Не приду, Разумихин! – Раскольников повернулся и пошел прочь.","“I won’t come, Razumikhin!” Raskolnikov turned and walked away.","“I won’t come, Razumikhin!” Raskolnikov said, turning and walking away.","‘I shan’t come, Razumikhin!’ And Raskolnikov turned and walked away.","“I shan’t come, Razumikhin.” Raskolnikov turned and walked away."
"– Э-эх, наплевать! – презрительно и с отвращением прошептал Раскольников, как бы и говорить не желая. Он было опять привстал, точно хотел куда-нибудь выйти, но опять сел в видимом отчаянии.","- Hey, don't care! - Raskolnikov whispered contemptuously and with disgust, as if not wanting to speak. He was about to get up again, as if he wanted to go out somewhere, but again he sat down in visible despair.","“Hey! I don’t give a damn!” Raskolnikov whispered with contempt and revulsion, as though not wishing to speak. He stood up again, as if wanting to go somewhere, but then he sat down again, in visible despondency.","‘A-ah, who cares!’ whispered Raskolnikov, full of scorn and revulsion, as if he didn’t even want to talk about it. He started to get up, as though he meant to go out somewhere, but sat down again in evident despair.","“Oh, damn it!” Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, as though he did not want to speak aloud. He got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat down again in evident despair."

"Через две минуты Настасья воротилась с супом и объявила, что сейчас и чай будет. К супу явились две ложки, две тарелки и весь прибор: солонка, перечница, горчица для говядины и прочее, чего прежде, в таком порядке, уже давно не бывало. Скатерть была чистая.","Two minutes later, Nastasya came back with soup and announced that now there would be tea. Two spoons, two plates and the whole appliance came to the soup: a salt shaker, a pepper shaker, mustard for beef, and so on, which had not happened in this order for a long time. The tablecloth was clean.","Two minutes later, Nastasya returned with some soup and declared that tea would be ready shortly. There were two soup spoons, two bowls, and complete settings: a saltcellar, pepper shaker, mustard for the beef, and so on, the likes of which he hadn’t seen in quite some time. There was even a clean tablecloth.","Two minutes later Nastasia came back with the soup and announced that the tea would be coming shortly. The soup came with two spoons, two plates, and all the condiments—a salt cellar, a pepper shaker, mustard for the beef, and so forth—things that hadn’t been seen here, set out like this, for a long time. And the tablecloth was clean.","In a couple of minutes Nastasia returned with the soup, and announced that the tea would soon be ready. With the soup she brought two spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on. The table was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean."
"«Фу, как это явно и нагло!» – с отвращением подумал Раскольников.","“Fu, how obvious and brazen it is!” Raskolnikov thought with disgust.",“Ugh! This is so obvious and insolent!” Raskolnikov thought with disgust.,"‘Ugh, how obvious and insulting!’ thought Raskolnikov in disgust.","“God, how obvious and insolent that is,” Raskolnikov thought with repulsion."
"– А чтобы те леший! – вскрикивает в ярости Миколка. Он бросает кнут, нагибается и вытаскивает со дна телеги длинную и толстую оглоблю, берет ее за конец в обе руки и с усилием размахивается над савраской.","- And so that those devil! - exclaims Mikolka in rage. He throws the whip, bends down and pulls out a long and thick shaft from the bottom of the cart, takes it by the end in both hands and swings it with effort over the Savrask.","“To hell with ya!” screams Mikolka in a fury. He throws his whip away, bends down, and pulls a long, thick wooden shaft from the bottom of his cart; he grabs hold of one end with both hands and raises it ominously above the mare. “He’ll crush ’er!”","‘Blast you to hell!’ yells Mikolka in a blind rage. He tosses his whip aside, bends down to the floor of the cart, and pulls out a long, thick wooden shaft. Holding it by the end with both hands, he flourishes it with all his strength over the little roan horse.","“I’ll teach you to kick,” Mikolka shouts ferociously. He throws down the whip, bends forward and picks up from the bottom of the cart a long, thick shaft, takes hold of one end with both hands and with an effort brandishes it over the mare."
"– Плохо рассчитываете, – перебил его Раскольников.","“You’re not counting well,” Raskolnikov interrupted him.","“You count badly,” Raskolnikov interrupted him.","‘You’re out in your reckoning,’ Raskolnikov interrupted him.","“You think wrongly,” interrupted Raskolnikov."
"– А говорить будем завтра; ложитесь, сейчас, непременно! – скрепил Разумихин, уходя с Зосимовым. – Завтра, как можно раньше, я у вас с рапортом.","- And we will talk tomorrow; lie down, now, by all means! - Razumikhin sealed, leaving with Zosimov. - Tomorrow, as early as possible, I will report to you.","“We’ll talk tomorrow. Now go to bed, right now, immediately!” Razumikhin insisted, leaving with Zosimov. “Tomorrow, as early as possible, I’ll come with a report.”","‘We’ll talk tomorrow. Go to bed now, straight away, you must!’ insisted Razumikhin as he left with Zosimov. ‘Tomorrow I’ll come and report to you as early as I can.’","“We’ll talk tomorrow; go to bed at once!” Razumikhin said in conclusion, following Zossimov out. “I’ll be with you tomorrow morning as early as possible with my report.”"
"– Да чего ты-то выпытываешь? – раздражительно крикнул Разумихин, – почем я знаю, шиш или ни шиша? Спроси сам, может, и узнаешь…","- What are you asking for? shouted Razumikhin irritably. Ask yourself, maybe you'll find out...",“Why are you interrogating me?” Razumikhin cried irritably. “How should I know if they’re broke or not? Ask them yourself. Maybe you’ll find out . . .”,‘What are you quizzing me for?’ cried Razumikhin irritably. ‘How can I know if they have a penny or not? Ask them yourself—you might find out…’,“But what business is it of yours?” Razumikhin cried with annoyance. “How can I tell whether they’ve got any money? Ask them yourself and perhaps you’ll find out . . . ”
"– Не язвите меня! Я не хочу!.. Говорю вам, что не хочу!.. Не могу и не хочу!.. Слышите! Слышите! – крикнул он, стукнув опять кулаком по столу.","- Don't tease me! I don't want to!.. I tell you that I don't want to!.. I can't and I don't want to!.. Hear! Hear! he shouted, slamming his fist on the table again.","“Don’t mock me! I won’t have it! I tell you, I won’t have it. I can’t stand it, and I won’t! Do you hear me? Do you?” he cried, banging his fist on the table again.","‘Stop baiting me! I won’t have it! I won’t have it, I tell you!… I can’t stand it and I won’t have it! Listen to me! Listen!’ he cried, thumping the table with his fist again.","“Don’t jeer at me! I won’t have it! I tell you I won’t have it. I can’t and I won’t , do you hear, do you hear?” he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table again."
"Одно ничтожнейшее обстоятельство поставило его в тупик, еще прежде чем он сошел с лестницы. Поровнявшись с хозяйкиною кухней, как и всегда отворенною настежь, он осторожно покосился в нее глазами, чтоб оглядеть предварительно: нет ли там, в отсутствие Настасьи, самой хозяйки, а если нет, то хорошо ли заперты двери в ее комнате, чтоб она тоже как-нибудь оттуда не выглянула, когда он за топором войдет? Но каково же было его изумление, когда он вдруг увидал, что Настасья не только на этот раз дома, у себя в кухне, но еще занимается делом: вынимает из корзины белье и развешивает на веревках! Увидев его, она перестала развешивать, обернулась к нему и все время смотрела на него, пока он проходил. Он отвел глаза и прошел, как будто ничего не замечая. Но дело было кончено: нет топора! Он был поражен ужасно.","One most insignificant circumstance puzzled him even before he stepped down the stairs. Coming up with the hostess's kitchen, which was always wide open, he carefully squinted at her in order to take a preliminary look: was there, in the absence of Nastasya, the hostess herself, and if not, were the doors in her room well locked, so that she would be like Didn't you look out of there when he enters for the ax? But what was his amazement when he suddenly saw that Nastasya was not only at home this time, in her kitchen, but was also doing business: she was taking out linen from the basket and hanging it on the ropes! Seeing him, she stopped hanging, turned to him and looked at him all the time as he passed. He averted his eyes and walked past, as if noticing nothing. But it was over: no ax! He was terribly amazed.","One extremely insignificant circumstance landed him in an impasse, even before he went down the stairs. Having reached the landlady’s kitchen, its door wide open as usual, he carefully peeked in to have a look around beforehand: by any chance was the landlady herself in there during Nastasya’s absence, and if not, was the door to her room firmly closed so that she couldn’t look out when he entered to take the axe? Imagine his astonishment when he suddenly saw that not only was Nastasya home this time, and in the kitchen, but that she was busy working: she was taking the laundry out of a basket and pinning it up to dry! Seeing him, she stopped hanging the linens, turned to him, and regarded him all the while he was passing. He looked away and walked by, as if not noticing anything. But that spelled the end of the whole affair: he had no axe! He felt utterly defeated.","One utterly trivial detail completely threw him, even before he reached the foot of the stairs. Coming level with his landlady’s kitchen, whose door as usual was wide open, he gave a cautious sidelong glance inside to spy out the situation. With Nastasia away, was the landlady herself inside, and if not, were the doors to her own room properly shut, so that she couldn’t suddenly look out just as he was going in for the axe? But what was his astonishment on suddenly seeing that not only was Nastasia herself at home this time, in her own kitchen— but she was actually busy taking linen out of a basket and hanging it out on the line! When she caught sight of him she stopped hanging out the clothes, turned towards him, and watched him walk past. He looked away and went on as though unaware of her. But all was lost—he didn’t have the axe! It was a terrible blow.","One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even left the staircase. When he reached the landlady’s kitchen, wide open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in Nastasia’s absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when he went in for the axe. To his amazement, however, he suddenly saw that Nastasia was not only at home in the kitchen this time, but was even occupied there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line! Seeing him, she stopped hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him all the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as though he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything: there was no axe! He was overwhelmed."
"– …Не верю! Не могу верить! – повторял озадаченный Разумихин, стараясь всеми силами опровергнуть доводы Раскольникова. Они подходили уже к нумерам Бакалеева, где Пульхерия Александровна и Дуня давно поджидали их. Разумихин поминутно останавливался дорогою в жару разговора, смущенный и взволнованный уже тем одним, что они в первый раз заговорили об этом ясно.","- …I do not believe! I can't believe! - repeated the puzzled Razumikhin, trying with all his might to refute Raskolnikov's arguments. They were already approaching Bakaleev's rooms, where Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dunya had been waiting for them for a long time. Razumikhin stopped every minute on the way in the heat of the conversation, embarrassed and agitated by the mere fact that for the first time they spoke of it clearly.","“. . . I don’t believe it! I can’t believe it!” a perplexed Razumikhin repeated, trying with all his might to refute Raskolnikov’s conclusions. They were already nearing Bakaleev’s house, where, in their rented rooms, Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna and Dunya had been waiting for them for quite a while. Razumikhin frequently paused along the way, impelled by the heat of the conversation, confused and agitated solely by the fact that it was the first time they had spoken plainly about that.","‘I don’t believe it! I can’t believe it!’ repeated Razumikhin in perplexity, trying his hardest to refute Raskolnikov’s arguments. They were already approaching Bakaleyev’s rooms, where Pulkheria Alexandrovna and Dunia had long been expecting them. Razumikhin kept stopping still, in the heat of the conversation, agitated and embarrassed because this was the first time they had openly talked about that.","“I DON’T BELIEVE IT, I can’t believe it!” repeated Razumikhin, trying in perplexity to refute Raskolnikov’s arguments. They were by now approaching Bakaleyev’s lodgings, where Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dunia had been expecting them a long while. Razumikhin kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about it."

"Он вошел в эту комнату (четвертую по порядку), тесную и битком набитую публикой, – народом несколько почище одетым, чем в тех комнатах. Между посетителями были две дамы. Одна в трауре, бедно одетая, сидела за столом против письмоводителя и что-то писала под его диктовку. Другая же дама, очень полная и багрово-красная, с пятнами, видная женщина, и что-то уж очень пышно одетая, с брошкой на груди величиной в чайное блюдечко, стояла в сторонке и чего-то ждала. Раскольников сунул письмоводителю свою повестку. Тот мельком взглянул на нее, сказал: «подождите», и продолжал заниматься с траурною дамой.","He entered this room (the fourth in order), cramped and crowded with an audience - people somewhat cleaner dressed than in those rooms.

Raskolnikov thrust his summons to the clerk. He glanced at her briefly, said: ""wait,"" and continued to study with the mourning lady.","He entered that room (the fourth in the row); it was cramped and crowded with people—they were dressed a little more neatly than those in the other rooms.

The other lady, very plump, had a dark red complexion with spots; a distinguished woman, very elegantly attired, with a brooch the size of a saucer on her bosom, she stood off to one side, waiting.

"– Это тебя я не узнавал в бреду? – спросил Раскольников, тоже помолчав с минуту и не оборачивая головы.","- I didn’t recognize you in my delirium? Raskolnikov asked, also after a pause for a minute and without turning his head.","“Was it you I didn’t recognize when I was delirious?” asked Raskolnikov, after keeping silent for a minute and not turning his head around.","‘I thought I’d entertain and amuse you with my chatter, but it looks as if I’ve only made you angry.’ ‘Was it you that I didn’t recognize when I was hallucinating?’ asked Raskolnikov after another pause, without turning his head.","“Was it you I didn’t recognize when I was delirious?” Raskolnikov asked, after a moment’s pause without turning his head."

"Раскольников вышел. Он еще мог расслышать, как по выходе его начался вдруг оживленный разговор, в котором слышнее всех отдавался вопросительный голос Никодима Фомича… На улице он совсем очнулся.","Raskolnikov went out.

"Раскольников взял газету и мельком взглянул на свою статью. Как ни противоречило это его положению и состоянию, но он ощутил то странное и язвительно-сладкое чувство, какое испытывает автор, в первый раз видящий себя напечатанным, к тому же и двадцать три года сказались. Это продолжалось одно мгновение. Прочитав несколько строк, он нахмурился, и страшная тоска сжала его сердце. Вся его душевная борьба последних месяцев напомнилась ему разом. С отвращением и досадой отбросил он статью на стол.","Raskolnikov took the newspaper and glanced briefly at his article. No matter how contrary to his position and condition, he felt that strange and caustic-sweet feeling that an author experiences when he sees himself in print for the first time, and besides, twenty-three years had an effect.

"Раскольников опустил правый локоть на стол, подпер пальцами правой руки снизу свой подбородок и пристально уставился на Свидригайлова. Он рассматривал с минуту его лицо, которое всегда его поражало и прежде. Это было какое-то странное лицо, похожее как бы на маску: белое, румяное, с румяными, алыми губами, с светло-белокурою бородой и с довольно еще густыми белокурыми волосами. Глаза были как-то слишком голубые, а взгляд их как-то слишком тяжел и неподвижен. Что-то было ужасно неприятное в этом красивом и чрезвычайно моложавом, судя по летам, лице. Одежда Свидригайлова была щегольская, летняя, легкая, в особенности щеголял он бельем. На пальце был огромный перстень с дорогим камнем.","Raskolnikov rested his right elbow on the table, propped his chin under the fingers of his right hand, and stared intently at Svidrigailov. For a minute he examined his face, which had always struck him before. It was a kind of strange face, as if looking like a mask: white, ruddy, with ruddy scarlet lips, with a light blond beard and rather thick blond hair. The eyes were somehow too blue, and their gaze was somehow too heavy and motionless. There was something terribly unpleasant in this beautiful and extremely youthful, judging by his years, face. Svidrigailov's clothes were dapper, summery, light, and he especially flaunted underwear. On the finger was a huge ring with an expensive stone.","Raskolnikov placed his right elbow on the table, rested his chin on the fingers of his right hand, and stared intently at Svidrigaylov. For about a minute he examined his face, which had always struck him, even previously. It was a somewhat strange face that seemed to resemble a mask: white, ruddy, with rosy, scarlet lips, a light blond beard, and a head of rather thick blond hair. His eyes were somehow too blue, and their gaze was too intense and unmoving. There was something terribly unpleasant in this handsome, extremely young-looking face, judging by his age. Svidrigaylov ’s clothes were fashionable, summery, and light; his linen was particularly elegant.

His eyes were somehow too blue, and their look somehow too heavy and unmoving. There was something terribly unattractive about that handsome face, so extraordinarily young for his years. * He was wearing stylish lightweight summer clothes, and his linen was particularly elegant.

His eyes were somehow too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. There was something extremely unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so wonderfully young for its age. Svidrigailov was smartly dressed in light summer clothes and looked particularly refined in his linen. He wore a huge ring with a precious stone in it."

"– Молодой человек, – продолжал он, восклоняясь опять, – в лице вашем я читаю как бы некую скорбь. Как вошли, я прочел ее, а потому тотчас же и обратился к вам. Ибо, сообщая вам историю жизни моей, не на позорище себя выставлять хочу перед сими празднолюбцами, которым и без того все известно, а чувствительного и образованного человека ищу. Знайте же, что супруга моя в благородном губернском дворянском институте воспитывалась и при выпуске с шалью танцевала при губернаторе и при прочих лицах, за что золотую медаль и похвальный лист получила. Медаль… ну медаль-то продали… уж давно… гм… похвальный лист до сих пор у ней в сундуке лежит, и еще недавно его хозяйке показывала. И хотя с хозяйкой у ней наибеспрерывнейшие раздоры, но хоть перед кем-нибудь погордиться захотелось и сообщить о счастливых минувших днях. И я не осуждаю, не осуждаю, ибо сие последнее у ней и осталось в воспоминаниях ее, а прочее все пошло прахом! Да, да; дама горячая, гордая и непреклонная. Пол сама моет и на черном хлебе сидит, а неуважения к себе не допустит. Оттого и господину Лебезятникову грубость его не захотела спустить, и когда прибил ее за то господин Лебезятников, то не столько от побоев, сколько от чувства в постель слегла. Вдовой уже взял ее, с троими детьми, мал мала меньше. Вышла замуж за первого мужа, за офицера пехотного, по любви, и с ним бежала из дому родительского. Мужа любила чрезмерно, но в картишки пустился, под суд попал, с тем и помер. Бивал он ее под конец; а она хоть и не спускала ему, о чем мне доподлинно и по документам известно, но до сих пор вспоминает его со слезами и меня им корит, и я рад, я рад, ибо хотя в воображениях своих зрит себя когда-то счастливой… И осталась она после него с тремя малолетними детьми в уезде далеком и зверском, где и я тогда находился, и осталась в такой нищете безнадежной, что я хотя и много видал приключений различных, но даже и описать не в состоянии. Родные же все отказались. Да и горда была, чересчур горда… И тогда-то, милостивый государь, тогда я, тоже вдовец, и от первой жены четырнадцатилетнюю дочь имея, руку свою предложил, ибо не мог смотреть на такое страдание. Можете судить потому, до какой степени ее бедствия доходили, что она, образованная и воспитанная и фамилии известной, за меня согласилась пойти! Но пошла! Плача и рыдая и руки ломая – пошла! Ибо некуда было идти. Понимаете ли, понимаете ли вы, милостивый государь, что значит, когда уже некуда больше идти? Нет! Этого вы еще не понимаете… И целый год я обязанность свою исполнял благочестиво и свято и не касался сего (он ткнул пальцем на полуштоф), ибо чувство имею. Но и сим не мог угодить; а тут места лишился, и тоже не по вине, а по изменению в штатах, и тогда прикоснулся!.. Полтора года уже будет назад, как очутились мы, наконец, после странствий и многочисленных бедствий, в сей великолепной и украшенной многочисленными памятниками столице. И здесь я место достал… Достал и опять потерял. Понимаете-с? Тут уже по собственной вине потерял, ибо черта моя наступила… Проживаем же теперь в угле, у хозяйки Амалии Федоровны Липпевехзель, а чем живем и чем платим, не ведаю. Живут же там многие и кроме нас… Содом-с, безобразнейший… гм… да… А тем временем возросла и дочка моя, от первого брака, и что только вытерпела она, дочка моя, от мачехи своей, возрастая, о том я умалчиваю. Ибо хотя Катерина Ивановна и преисполнена великодушных чувств, но дама горячая и раздраженная, и оборвет… Да-с! Ну, да нечего вспоминать о том! Воспитания, как и представить можете, Соня не получила. Пробовал я с ней, года четыре тому, географию и всемирную историю проходить; но как я сам был некрепок, да и приличных к тому руководств не имелось, ибо какие имевшиеся книжки… гм!.. ну, их уже теперь и нет, этих книжек, то тем и кончилось все обучение. На Кире Персидском остановились. Потом, уже достигнув зрелого возраста, прочла она несколько книг содержания романтического, да недавно еще, через посредство господина Лебезятникова, одну книжку «Физиологию» Льюиса[7] – изволите знать-с? – с большим интересом прочла, и даже нам отрывочно вслух сообщала: вот и все ее просвещение. Теперь же обращусь к вам, милостивый государь мой, сам от себя с вопросом приватным: много ли может, по-вашему, бедная, но честная девица честным трудом заработать?.. Пятнадцать копеек в день, сударь, не заработает, если честна и не имеет особых талантов, да и то рук не покладая работавши! Да и то статский советник Клопшток, Иван Иванович, – изволили слышать? – не только денег за шитье полдюжины голландских рубах до сих пор не отдал, но даже с обидой погнал ее, затопав ногами и обозвав неприлично, под видом, будто бы рубашечный ворот сшит не по мерке и косяком. А тут ребятишки голодные… А тут Катерина Ивановна, руки ломая, по комнате ходит, да красные пятна у ней на щеках выступают, – что в болезни этой и всегда бывает: «Живешь, дескать, ты, дармоедка, у нас, ешь и пьешь, и теплом пользуешься», а что тут пьешь и ешь, когда и ребятишки-то по три дня корки не видят! Лежал я тогда… ну, да уж что! лежал пьяненькой-с, и слышу, говорит моя Соня (безответная она, и голосок у ней такой кроткий… белокуренькая, личико всегда бледненькое, худенькое), говорит: «Что ж, Катерина Ивановна, неужели же мне на такое дело пойти?» А уж Дарья Францовна, женщина злонамеренная и полиции многократно известная, раза три через хозяйку наведывалась. «А что ж, – отвечает Катерина Ивановна, в пересмешку, – чего беречь? Эко сокровище!» Но не вините, не вините, милостивый государь, не вините! Не в здравом рассудке сие сказано было, а при взволнованных чувствах, в болезни и при плаче детей не евших, да и сказано более ради оскорбления, чем в точном смысле… Ибо Катерина Ивановна такого уж характера, и как расплачутся дети, хоть бы и с голоду, тотчас же их бить начинает. И вижу я, эдак часу в шестом, Сонечка встала, надела платочек, надела бурнусик[8] и с квартиры отправилась, а в девятом часу и назад обратно пришла. Пришла, и прямо к Катерине Ивановне, и на стол перед ней тридцать целковых молча выложила. Ни словечка при этом не вымолвила, хоть бы взглянула, а взяла только наш большой драдедамовый[9] зеленый платок (общий такой у нас платок есть, драдедамовый), накрыла им совсем голову и лицо и легла на кровать лицом к стенке, только плечики да тело все вздрагивают… А я, как и давеча, в том же виде лежал-с… И видел я тогда, молодой человек, видел я, как затем Катерина Ивановна, так же ни слова не говоря, подошла к Сонечкиной постельке и весь вечер в ногах у ней на коленках простояла, ноги ей целовала, встать не хотела, а потом так обе и заснули вместе, обнявшись… обе… обе… да-с… а я… лежал пьяненькой-с.","“Young man,” he continued, exclaiming again, “in your face I read as if some kind of sorrow. As soon as they entered, I read it, and therefore I immediately turned to you. For, in telling you the story of my life, I do not want to expose myself to disgrace in front of these idle-lovers, who already know everything, but I am looking for a sensitive and educated person. Know, then, that my wife was brought up in a noble provincial noble institute and, when she graduated, she danced with a shawl in the presence of the governor and in front of other persons, for which she received a gold medal and a certificate of commendation. The medal ... well, the medal was sold ... a long time ago ... um ... the certificate of commendation is still in her chest, and until recently she showed it to her mistress. And although she had the most uninterrupted quarrels with the mistress, at least she wanted to be proud of someone and report on the happy days gone by. And I do not condemn, I do not condemn, for this last thing remained with her in her memories, and the rest all went to dust! Yes Yes; the lady is hot, proud and unyielding. She washes the floor herself and sits on black bread, but she will not tolerate disrespect for herself. That is why the rudeness of Mr. Lebezyatnikov did not want to let him down, and when Mr. Lebezyatnikov nailed her for that, it was not so much from beatings as from feeling that she fell into bed. The widow has already taken her, with three children, small, small. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and with him fled from her parents' house. She loved her husband excessively, but he started playing cards, got on trial, and died with that. He beat her at the end; and although she did not let him down, which I know for certain and according to documents, she still remembers him with tears and reproaches me with it, and I am glad, I am glad, because although in her imaginations she sees herself once happy ... And She remained after him with three young children in a distant and brutal district, where I was then, and remained in such hopeless poverty that, although I had seen many different adventures, I was not even able to describe. Relatives all refused. Yes, and she was proud, too proud ... And then, my dear sir, then I, too, a widower, and having a fourteen-year-old daughter from my first wife, offered my hand, for I could not look at such suffering. You can judge because to what extent her misfortunes reached, that she, educated and brought up and with a well-known surname, agreed to go for me! But she went! Crying and sobbing and wringing my hands - let's go! For there was nowhere to go. Do you understand, do you understand, my dear sir, what it means when there is nowhere else to go? Not! You still don’t understand this ... And for a whole year I performed my duty piously and holy and did not touch it (he jabbed his finger at the half-duster), for I have a feeling. But this could not please either; and then he lost his place, and also not through fault, but due to a change in the states, and then he touched it! .. A year and a half ago, we finally found ourselves, after wanderings and numerous disasters, in this magnificent capital decorated with numerous monuments. And here I got a place ... I got it and lost it again. Do you understand? Here I have already lost it through my own fault, for my line has come ... We are now living in the coal, with the mistress Amalia Fedorovna Lippevekhzel, and I don’t know how we live and what we pay. Many live there and besides us ... Sodom, sir, the ugliest ... um ... yes ... And in the meantime, my daughter grew up from her first marriage, and what she, my daughter, only endured from her stepmother, growing up, I keep silent about that. For although Katerina Ivanovna is full of magnanimous feelings, the lady is hot and irritated, and she will cut off ... Yes, sir! Well, there is nothing to remember about that! As you can imagine, Sonya did not receive upbringing. I tried with her, about four years ago, to go through geography and world history; but as I myself was not strong, and there were no decent manuals, for what books were available… hm! .. well, they are no longer there, these books, that was the end of all the training. They stopped at Cyrus the Persian. Then, having already reached adulthood, she read several books of romantic content, and more recently, through Mr. Lebezyatnikov, one book ""Physiology"" by Lewis [7] - if you please know, sir? - I read it with great interest, and even to us fragmentarily aloud told us: this is all her enlightenment. Now I will turn to you, my dear sir, on my own behalf with a private question: how much can, in your opinion, a poor but honest girl earn by honest labor? .. Fifteen kopecks a day, sir, will not work if she is honest and has special talents, and even then worked tirelessly! And even then the State Councilor Klopstock, Ivan Ivanovich - did you deign to hear? - not only has he still not given money for sewing half a dozen Dutch shirts, but he even chased her with resentment, stamping his feet and calling it indecent, under the pretext that the shirt collar was not sewn to measure and by a jamb. And here the kids are hungry ... And here Katerina Ivanovna, wringing her hands, walks around the room, but red spots on her cheeks stick out - that this disease always happens: “You live, they say, you, a parasite, are here, eat and drink , and you use the warmth "", but what do you drink and eat here, when even the children for three days do not see the crust! I was lying then ... well, really! I was lying drunk, sir, and I heard my Sonya say (she is unrequited, and her voice is so mild ... fair, her face is always pale, thin), says: ""Well, Katerina Ivanovna, can I really go to such a thing?"" And Darya Frantsovna, a malicious woman who was known to the police many times, visited her through the hostess three times. “Well,” replies Katerina Ivanovna, in a mocking laugh, “what should we take care of? Eco treasure! "" But do not blame, do not blame, sir, do not blame! This was not said in their common sense, but with agitated feelings, in illness and in the cry of children who did not eat, and it was said more for the sake of insult than in the exact sense ... For Katerina Ivanovna is of such a character, and how children will cry, even with hunger, immediately begins to beat them. And I see, at about six o'clock, Sonechka got up, put on a handkerchief, put on a burnusik [8] and left the apartment, and at nine o'clock she came back. She came straight to Katerina Ivanovna and silently laid thirty rubles on the table in front of her. She didn’t say a word at the same time, even if she glanced at it, but took only our big green handkerchief [9] (we have such a handkerchief in common, the old one), completely covered her head and face with it and lay down on the bed facing the wall, only hangers all the body shudders ... And I, as before, lay in the same form, sir ... And then I saw, young man, I saw how then Katerina Ivanovna, without saying a word, went up to Sonechka's bed and all evening in She stood on her knees, kissed her feet, did not want to get up, and then both fell asleep together, embracing ... both ... both ... yes ... and I ... lay drunk, sir.","“Young man,” he continued, raising his head again, “I can read some sorrow in your face. I saw it when you entered, and that’s why I turned to you right away. In telling you the story of my life, I don’t wish to parade my disgrace before these idlers here, who know it all already; I’m seeking a sensitive, educated man. Do you know that my wife was educated in a provincial school for children of the nobility, and at the award ceremony she was chosen to perform the shawl dance§ in the presence of the governor and other distinguished guests, for which she received a gold medal and a certificate of merit? A medal . . . well, we sold that medal . . . a long time ago . . . hmm . . . the certificate’s still in her trunk, and she recently showed it to our landlady. Even though she has endless quarrels with the landlady, she wanted to show off to someone and tell her about those happy days in the past. I don’t condemn her, I don’t, because these things are preserved in her memory, and all the rest has turned to dust! Yes, yes; she’s a hot-tempered woman, proud and obstinate. She washes the floor herself and has only black bread to eat, but she won’t tolerate any disrespect. That’s why she wouldn’t tolerate Mr. Lebezyatnikov’s rudeness, and when he gave her a beating, she took to her bed more as a result of her feeling than from the actual blows. She was already a widow when I married her, with three children, each smaller than the other. Her first husband was a cavalry officer, and she married him for love and ran away from her parents’ house with him. She loved her husband dearly, but he took to gambling, ended up in court, and soon died. He’d begun beating her toward the end; although she didn’t let him get away with it, about which I have detailed documentary evidence; she weeps to this day when she remembers him and reproaches me. I’m glad, very glad that even in her imagination she can see herself as being happy for a while. . . . After his death she was left with three young children in a distant and dreadful provincial town, where I was also staying at the time; she was living in such hopeless poverty—even though I’ve had many different experiences, I can’t even begin to describe her situation. Her family refused to help her. Besides, she was proud, extremely proud. . . . And then, my dear sir, then, being a widower myself, and having a fourteen-year-old daughter, I proposed to her because I couldn’t bear to see such suffering. You can judge for yourself the degree of her misfortune, that she, an educated and well-brought-up woman from an eminent family, agreed to marry the likes of me! But she did! Weeping and wailing, wringing her hands, she did! Because she had nowhere else to go. Do you understand, do you really understand, dear sir, what it means when a person has nowhere else to go? No! You don’t understand it yet. . . . For one whole year I fulfilled my obligation devotedly and devoutly and never touched the bottle”—he pointed to the bottle—“because I do have feelings. But even then I couldn’t please her, even with that; it was afterward, when I lost my job, which wasn’t my fault, but it happened because of changes in the department that I turned to drink! It’s already been about half a year, after our wanderings and numerous misfortunes, since we finally turned up in this splendid capital with all of its many monuments. And I found a job here. . . . I found one and then I lost it. Do you understand, sir? This time it was my own fault, because I had reached the end of my rope. . . . Now we live in a little corner, at our landlady’s, Amaliya Fedorovna Lippevekhsel, but I don’t know how we manage to live and pay her. Many others live there besides us. . . . It’s Sodom, sir, of the most hideous kind . . . hmm . . . yes. . . . Meanwhile my daughter from my first marriage has grown up; I won’t describe what she had to suffer while growing up, my daughter, from her stepmother. Because although Katerina Ivanovna is filled with kindly feelings, she’s a hot-tempered and irritable lady, and she can snap. . . . Yes, sir! There’s no reason to recall it! As you can well imagine, Sonya received no education. About four years ago, I tried to read some geography and world history with her; but since I myself was weak in those areas and we had no suitable textbooks, and the books we did have . . . hmm . . . well, we don’t even have those books now, all our reading ended then and there. We stopped at the Persian king Cyrus the Great.¶ Then, once she was older, she read some books of romantic content as well as several others, given to her by Mr. Lebezyatnikov. One was Lewes’s Physiology. # Do you happen to know it, sir? She read it with great interest and even read some passages aloud to us: and that was her entire education. Now I’m turning to you, my dear sir, on my own behalf, with a confidential question of my own: in your opinion, can a poor but honest girl earn a living by honest work? She can’t earn even fifteen kopecks a day, sir, if she’s honest, since she possesses no special skills, and that’s even if she works all the time! Besides, the state councillor Ivan Ivanovich Klopshtok—have you ever heard of him? Not only hasn’t he paid her yet for the half dozen fine cotton shirts she made him, but he even drove her out with insults, stamping his feet and calling her names, claiming that the collars were the wrong size and had been sewn in crooked. Meanwhile the children go hungry. . . . And then Katerina Ivanovna, wringing her hands, paces the room , her face flushed with the red blotches that always accompany that illness: ‘You live here with us,’ she says, ‘like a sponger; you eat and drink and enjoy the warmth, but what’s there to eat and drink when these little ones haven’t seen a crust of bread for three days?’ I was lying there at the time . . . why not say it? I was a little drunk, sir, and I heard my Sonya (she’s very meek and has such a soft voice . . . she’s fair-haired and her face is always so pale and thin), say: ‘Oh, Katerina Ivanovna, must I really go out and do that?’ Meanwhile, Darya Frantsevna, a malevolent woman well known to the police, had reported her to the landlady several times. ‘ So what?’ replied Katerina Ivanovna, with a mocking laugh, ‘What are you saving yourself for? What a treasure!’ But don’t blame her, don’t, dear sir, don’t blame her! She wasn’t in her right mind when she said it; she was agitated, sick, and the children were crying because they hadn’t eaten, and she said it more as an insult than as what she really meant. . . . Because Katerina Ivanovna is the sort of person who, as soon as the children begin crying, even when they’re hungry, begins to beat them right away. And then I saw how Sonechka, around six o’clock, got up, put on a kerchief, her hooded cloak, and left the apartment; she came back at nine. She walked in and went straight up to Katerina Ivanovna and silently put thirty silver rubles down on the table in front of her. She didn’t utter one word as she did, didn’t even look at her, but merely picked up our large green shawl (we have one that we use), covered her head and face completely, and lay down on the bed, facing the wall, but her whole body and her little shoulders were trembling. . . . Meanwhile, sir, I lay there, in the same condition as before. . . . And then I saw, young man, I saw how Katerina Ivanovna, also without saying a word, went up to Sonechka’s bed and knelt there all evening, kissing her feet; she was unable to stand, and then, embracing, they both fell asleep together . . . both of them . . . both of them . . . yes, sir . . . while I . . . I lay there drunk, sir.”","‘Young man,’ he went on, raising his head again, ‘I can read in your face some kind of heartache. I read it when you entered, and that was why I addressed you straight away. For I am relating the history of my life to you, not in order to expose my shame to these idlers here, who know it all anyway —I do so because I seek to find a sensitive and educated person. Let me tell you, therefore, that my spouse was educated in a high-class provincial institute for daughters of the gentry, and when she left it she danced the shawl dance* before the Governor and other personages, for which she received a gold medal and a certificate of merit. The medal… well, that medal was sold… a long time ago… um… but the certificate of merit is still kept in her trunk, and she showed it to our landlady quite recently. For although she is engaged in the most unremitting conflict with our landlady, she did wish to show off to somebody, anybody, to whom she could speak of her happy days of long ago. Nor do I condemn her, nor do I condemn her, for that is the last of the memories left to her, everything else has gone up in smoke! Oh yes, she is a hot-blooded lady, proud and unbending. She will wash the floor with her own hands, and live on black bread, but she will not tolerate disrespect. That was why she would not put up with Mr Lebeziatnikov’s rudeness, and when Mr Lebeziatnikov beat her for that, it was not so much the beating as her own injured feelings that caused her to take to her bed. I took her as a widow, with her three children, each one smaller than the last. Her first husband was an infantry officer whom she married for love, and she ran away from home with him. She was passionately in love with her husband, but he took up cards, ended up in court, and that was how he died. By the end he used to beat her, and although she paid him back, of which I have reliable written proof, yet even now she remembers him with tears in her eyes, and holds up his example as a reproach to me, and I’m glad she does, yes, glad that—even if only in her imagination—she sees herself as having once been happy… And after he died she was left alone with three little children, in a far-off and savage district where I too found myself at the time; she was left in such abject poverty that I, though I have seen all kinds of adventures in my time, find it impossible to describe. All her family had cast her off. And how proud she was, unbelievably proud… And then it was, my dear sir, then it was, that I, a widower myself, with a fourteen-year-old daughter by my first wife, offered her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of her suffering. So you can judge for yourself how sunk in misery she was, an educated, well-bred woman from a good family, to have agreed to marry me! But she married me! Weeping, and sobbing, and wringing her hands, she married me! Because she had nowhere to turn. Can you understand, can you understand, my dear sir, what it means to have nowhere else to turn? No! You cannot yet understand that… And for a whole year long I fulfilled my obligations, honourably and religiously, and never touched this stuff (prodding the bottle with a finger), for I do have feelings. But even this did not serve; for I lost my position, and that not through any fault of my own, but because of staffing changes; and then I did touch it!… It must be a year and a half ago now that we eventually found ourselves, after much wandering and many disasters, in this splendid capital city adorned with numerous monuments. And here I obtained a post… obtained it and lost it again. Do you understand, sir? And I lost it through my own fault, for my weakness caught up with me… And now we live in a little corner at our landlady ’s , Amalia Fedorovna Lippewechsel, and how we stay alive and how we pay her I do not know. There are many other people living there as well as us… a real bear-garden , utterly disgusting… um, yes… And by this time my daughter had grown up, my daughter from my first marriage, and what she suffered, my little daughter, from her stepmother while she grew up—I’ll say nothing about that. For although Katerina Ivanovna is filled with generous sentiments, yet she is a hot-tempered and irritable lady, with a sharp tongue… Yes indeed, sir! Well, no use talking about that. As you can imagine, Sonia has had no education. Some four years ago, I did try teaching her some geography and world history; but as I myself was none too knowledgeable in those matters, and had no suitable textbooks, for any books that we had … hm!… well, we don’t have them any longer, those books; and that was the end of all her education. We finished up on Cyrus of Persia. * And after that, when she was grown up, she read a number of books of a romantic kind, and quite recently she read a certain book which she obtained through Mr Lebeziatnikov—Lewes’s Physiology, * do you happen to know it?—and was most interested in it, and even read portions of it to us. That was the end of her education. And now, my dear sir, I should like to ask you a personal question. Can a poor but honest young girl, in your opinion, earn much by honest labour? She cannot even make fifteen kopeks a day, sir, if she is honest and possesses no special talents—not even if she works without ceasing. And even so, State Councillor Klopstock, Ivan Ivanovich—have you happened to hear of him?—has so far not only failed to pay her for making him half a dozen Holland shirts,* but drove her ignominiously away, stamping his feet and calling her bad names, on the pretext that the shirt collars were the wrong size and set in crooked. And there were the children, going hungry… And Katerina Ivanovna, walking up and down the room wringing her hands, with the red patches coming out on her cheeks—which always occurs in that disease—and telling her “Look at you, you bloodsucker, living in our home, eating and drinking and keeping yourself warm”—though how could she be eating and drinking when even the little ones never saw a crust for three days on end!—I was lying there at the time… well, never mind that!—I was lying there tipsy, and I heard my Sonia answer (she’s so meek, with such a soft little voice … she’s fair-haired, and her face is always pale and thin), and she said “What do you mean, Katerina Ivanovna, do I really have to come to that?” For Darya Frantsevna, an evil-minded woman well known to the police, had already been three times to see our landlady and make propositions. “What of it?” replies Katerina Ivanovna with a mocking laugh. “What are you so keen to protect? Some treasure, indeed!” But don’t blame her, don’t blame her, my dear sir, don’t blame her! She was not in her right mind when she said that, her nerves were shattered, and she was sick, and the children crying because they had nothing to eat; and she said it more by way of an insult than meaning what she said. For Katerina Ivanovna is like that; if the children are crying, even if it’s from hunger, she’ll set about beating them at once. And so some time after five, I saw Sonia get up, put on her headscarf and cloak, and leave the apartment, and she came back after eight. In she came and went straight over to Katerina Ivanovna, and silently laid down thirty roubles on the table in front of her. And not a word did she say, she didn’t even look at her, she just picked up our big green drap-de-dames * shawl —we have a big green shawl in our flat, made of drap-de-dames—and covered her head and face with it, and lay down on her bed with her face to the wall, with her little shoulders and body shaking, on and on… And I was still lying there, just as before, sir… And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna go over to Sonechka’s bed, without a word, and she stayed the whole evening kneeling at her feet, kissing her feet, and she wouldn’t get up, and then the two of them fell asleep together like that, in each other’s arms… the two of them… the two of them… yes, sir… while I… lay there tipsy, sir.’","“Young man,” he went on, raising his head again, “in your face I seem to read some kind of sorrow. When you came in I read it, and that was why I addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners, who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a high-class school for the daughters of noble-men, and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages, for which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit. The medal . . . well, the medal of course was sold—long ago, hm . . . but the certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed it to our landlady. And although she quarrels with the landlady most continually, yet she wanted to boast to someone or other of her past honors and to tell of the happy days that are gone. I don’t condemn her for it , I don’t condemn her, for the one thing left her is her memories of the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes! Yes, yes, she is a hot-tempered lady, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treated with disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the other. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and ran away with him from her father’s house. She loved her husband very much; but he gave way to cards, wound up in court and with that he died. He used to beat her at the end: and although she didn’t let him get away with it, of which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of him with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad , I am glad that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having once been happy . . . And she was left at his death with three children in a beastly and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she was left in such hopeless destitution that, although I have seen many ups and downs of all sorts, I am unable to describe it even. Her relations had all abandoned her. And she was proud, too, excessively proud . . . And then, dear sir, and then, I, being at the time a widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she married me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, dear sir, do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No, that you don’t understand yet . . . And for a whole year, I performed my duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this” (he tapped the jug with his finger), “for I have feelings. But even so, I could not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch it! . . . It will already be a year and a half ago since we found ourselves at last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent capital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here, too, I obtained a position . . . I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This time it was through my own fault I lost it: for my trait had come out . . . We have now a corner at Amalia Fiodorovna Lippewechsel’s; and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say. There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. A most abominable Sodom . . . hm . . . yes . . . And meanwhile my daughter by my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with from her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of. For, though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a high-tempered lady, irritable, and will cut you off ... Yes. But it’s no use going over that! Sonia, as you may well imagine, has had no education. I did make an effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and world history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we had no suitable manuals, and what books we had . . . hm, anyway, we don’t have them now, those books, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at Cyrus of Persia.5 Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read other books of novelistic tendency and recently she had read with great interest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes’ Physiology6—do you know it?—and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that’s the whole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, dear sir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen kopecks a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special talent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what’s more, Ivan Ivanich Klopstock the state councilor—have you heard of him?—has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen Holland shirts she made him and drove her away insulted, stamping and calling her names, on the pretext that the shirt collars were not made the right size and were put in askew. And there are the little ones hungry . . . And Katerina Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed red, as they always are in that disease: ‘You sponger,’ says she, ‘living with us, eating and drinking and keeping warm.’ And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little ones for three days! I was lying at the time . . . well, what of it! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a meek creature with a gentle little voice . . . fair hair and such a pale, thin little face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing like that?’ Daria Frantsevna, an evil-minded woman and very well known to the police, had two or three times already tried to get at her through the landlady. ‘ And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer, ‘what’s there to save? Some treasure!’ But don’t blame her, don’t blame her, dear sir, don’t blame her! She was not in her right mind when she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than in any precise sense . . . For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when children cry, even from hunger, she starts beating them at once. At six o’clock or so I saw Sonechka get up, put on her kerchief, put on her cape, and go out of the room, and about nine o’clock she came back. She walked straight up to Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty rubles on the table before her in silence. She did not utter a word , she did not even look at her, she simply picked up our big green woolen shawl (we all use it, this woolen shawl), put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her body kept shuddering . . . And I went on lying there, just as before . . . And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence go up to Sonechka’s little bed; she was on her knees all evening kissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell asleep in each other’s arms . . . together, together . . . yes . . . and I . . . lay drunk.”"

You, father, have now deigned to note this with perfect justice and wit. (Raskolnikov did not notice anything of the sort.) You'll get confused, sir! Right, you're confused! and everything is one and the same, everything is one and the same, like a drum! The reform is underway, and we will at least be renamed in the name, heh! heh! heh! As for our legal methods, as one wittily deigned to put it, I completely agree with you, sir. Well, who, tell me, of all the defendants, even of the most meager peasant, does not know that, for example, they will first begin to lull him with extraneous questions (as your happy expression), and then suddenly they will be taken aback in the very crown, with an ax , heh! heh! heh! in the very crown, according to your happy likeness! heh! heh! so you really thought that I wanted you with an apartment ... heh! heh!

The form will never go away, let me reassure you about that, sir; Yes, what is, in essence, the form, I ask you? It is impossible to hamper the investigator at every step with the uniform.

Right on the crown of his head, as you put it so well! So you really thought that when I talked about my flat, I was trying… heh-heh! What an ironic fellow you are! Well, I won’t go on. Ah, yes, by the way—one idea leads to another—you also said something about formalities, you know, regarding some little interrogation… But what’s the sense of formalities! You know, formalities are often quite pointless. Sometimes it’s better just to have a friendly little talk, and more useful too. The formalities won’t go away, I promise you; and anyway, what do formalities actually mean, may I ask? You can’t tie an investigator down with formalities at every step. His job, after all, is what you might call, in its own way, a liberal art, or something of the kind… heh-heh-heh!’ Porfiry Petrovich paused a moment to get his breath.","“I can’t offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a friend,” Porfiry pattered on, “and you know all these official duties . . . please don’t mind my running up and down, forgive me, my dear fellow , I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is absolutely indispensable for me.

I assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for the interrogator than for the interrogated ... You made the observation yourself just now very aptly and wittily.” (Raskolnikov had made no observation of the kind.) “People get into a muddle! A real muddle! They keep harping on the same note, like a drum! There will be a reform and we shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And as for our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree with you. Every prisoner on trial, even the simplest peasant, knows that they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily put it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!—your beautiful expressions, my boy, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by government quarters . . . he-he! You are truly ironic. So, come. I won’t go on! Ah, by the way, yes! One word leads to another. You spoke of formality just now, apropos of the inquiry, you know. But what’s the use of formality? In many cases it’s nonsense. Sometimes you have a friendly chat and get a good deal more out of it. You can always fall back on formality, may I assure you. And, after all, what does it amount to? An examining lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step. The work of investigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!” Porfiry Petrovich paused for breath."

"Лужин молчал и презрительно улыбался. Впрочем, он был очень бледен. Казалось, что он обдумывал, как бы ему вывернуться. Может быть, он бы с удовольствием бросил все и ушел, но в настоящую минуту это было почти невозможно; это значило прямо сознаться в справедливости взводимых на него обвинений и в том, что он действительно оклеветал Софью Семеновну. К тому же и публика, и без того уже подпившая, слишком волновалась. Провиантский, хотя, впрочем, и не все понимавший, кричал больше всех и предлагал некоторые весьма неприятные для Лужина меры. Но были и не пьяные; сошлись и собрались изо всех комнат. Все три полячка ужасно горячились и кричали ему беспрестанно: «пане лайдак![66]», причем бормотали еще какие-то угрозы по-польски. Соня слушала с напряжением, но как будто тоже не все понимала, точно просыпалась от обморока. Она только не спускала своих глаз с Раскольникова, чувствуя, что в нем вся ее защита. Катерина Ивановна трудно и хрипло дышала и была, казалось, в страшном изнеможении. Всех глупее стояла Амалия Ивановна, разинув рот и ровно ничего не смысля. Она только видела, что Петр Петрович как-то попался. Раскольников попросил было опять говорить, но ему уже не дали докончить: все кричали и теснились около Лужина с ругательствами и угрозами. Но Петр Петрович не струсил. Видя, что уже дело по обвинению Сони вполне проиграно, он прямо прибегнул к наглости.","Luzhin was silent and smiled contemptuously. However, he was very pale. He seemed to be contemplating how he could get out. Maybe he would have gladly dropped everything and gone, but at the present moment it was almost impossible; it meant openly confessing the justice of the accusations leveled against him and that he had indeed slandered Sofya Semyonovna. In addition, the audience, already drunk, was too worried. The proviantsky, although, by the way, did not understand everything, shouted more than anyone and suggested some measures that were very unpleasant for Luzhin. But they were not drunk either; converged and gathered from all the rooms. All three Poles were terribly excited and shouted to him incessantly: ""Sir laydak! [66]"", and muttered some other threats in Polish. Sonya listened with tension, but as if she did not understand everything either, as if she were waking up from a swoon. She just did not take her eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that he contained all her protection. Katerina Ivanovna was breathing hard and hoarsely, and seemed to be in terrible exhaustion. Amalia Ivanovna stood the most stupid of all, with her mouth open and understanding absolutely nothing. She only saw that Pyotr Petrovich had somehow been caught. Raskolnikov asked to speak again, but they did not let him finish: everyone was shouting and crowding around Luzhin with curses and threats. But Pyotr Petrovich did not flinch. Seeing that the case against Sonya had already been completely lost, he directly resorted to impudence.","Luzhin remained silent and smiled contemptuously. However, he looked very pale. He seemed to be thinking about how he could extricate himself. Perhaps he would have dropped the entire matter with pleasure and walked out, but at the present moment that was almost impossible; that would mean admitting the accuracy of the accusations against him—namely, that he really was slandering Sofiya Semyonovna. In addition, the people here, many of whom had already drunk a fair amount, were too agitated. The quartermaster, although he didn’t understand everything, was shouting more than anyone and proposed some very unpleasant measures against Luzhin. But there were also some people who were not drunk; they came in from the other rooms and gathered together. All three of the little Poles were terribly angry and were shouting constantly: ‘Pan jest łajdak!’‡ In addition, they were muttering still other threats in Polish. Sonya listened with effort, but also seemed not to understand everything, as if she were recovering from a fainting spell. But she didn’t take her eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that he was her best defense. Katerina Ivanovna was breathing with difficulty and wheezing; she seemed to be terribly exhausted. Amaliya Ivanovna stood there, looking the most foolish of all, her mouth open wide and without a thought in her head. She merely saw that Petr Petrovich had somehow been exposed. Raskolnikov was about to speak again but wasn’t allowed to do so: everyone was shouting and crowding around Luzhin with curses and threats. But Petr Petrovich didn’t cringe. Seeing that his attempt to accuse Sonya had failed completely, he resorted directly to effrontery.","Luzhin remained silent, with a scornful smile on his face. But he was very pale. He seemed to be wondering how to get out of this. He might perhaps have happily let it all drop and gone away, but at the moment that was almost impossible—it would have meant openly admitting that the accusations against him were true, and that he really had slandered Sofia Semionovna. Besides, the guests (who had had a fair amount to drink) were too restive. The supply clerk, though he hadn’t understood it all, was shouting louder than anyone, and suggesting various steps that would be very unpleasant for Luzhin. But there were some who weren’t drunk, for people had gathered there from all the rooms. All the three little Poles were getting terribly excited and kept shouting at him ‘Pan lajdak!’ , * and muttering all sorts of other threats in Polish. Sonia was listening tensely, but also seemed not to understand everything, as though just coming round from a swoon. She, too, never moved her eyes from Raskolnikov, feeling that he was her only protector. Katerina Ivanovna was gasping hoarsely, and looked utterly exhausted. Amalia Ivanovna cut the stupidest figure of all; she stood there with her mouth hanging open and had no idea what was going on. All she could see was that Piotr Petrovich had somehow got the worst of it. Raskolnikov tried to add something more, but wasn’t allowed to finish; everyone was crowding round Luzhin and shouting oaths and threats. But Piotr Petrovich wasn’t daunted. He could see that his accusation against Sonia had utterly failed, so he went straight for brazen effrontery.","Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he was very pale. He seemed to be considering the best means of escape. Perhaps he would have been glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this was scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth of the accusations brought against him. Moreover, the guests, who had already been excited by drink, were now too emotional to allow it. The commissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position, was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions which were very unpleasant to Luzhin. But not everyone there was drunk; tenants came in from all the rooms. The three Poles were tremendously excited and were continually shouting at him: “The Pan is a lajdak!”50 and muttering threats in Polish. Sonia had been listening with strained attention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as though she had just returned to consciousness. She did not take her eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that in him lay her personal safety. Katerina Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed horribly exhausted. Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth wide open, unable to make out what had happened. She only saw that Peter Petrovich had somehow come to grief. Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him. Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse. But Peter Petrovich was not intimidated. Seeing that his accusation of Sonia had completely failed, he reverted to insolence:"

"Раскольников обернулся к ней и с волнением смотрел на нее: да, так и есть! Она уже вся дрожала в действительной, настоящей лихорадке. Он ожидал этого. Она приближалась к слову о величайшем и неслыханном чуде, и чувство великого торжества охватило ее. Голос ее стал звонок, как металл; торжество и радость звучали в нем и крепили его. Строчки мешались перед ней, потому что в глазах темнело, но она знала наизусть, что читала. При последнем стихе: «не мог ли сей, отверзший очи слепому…» – она, понизив голос, горячо и страстно передала сомнение, укор и хулу неверующих, слепых иудеев, которые сейчас, через минуту, как громом пораженные, падут, зарыдают и уверуют… «И он, он – тоже ослепленный и неверующий, – он тоже сейчас услышит, он тоже уверует, да, да! сейчас же, теперь же», – мечталось ей, и она дрожала от радостного ожидания.","Raskolnikov turned to her and looked at her with excitement: yes, it is so!

"Он легко отыскал Разумихина; в доме Починкова нового жильца уже знали, и дворник тотчас указал ему дорогу. Уже с половины лестницы можно было различить шум и оживленный говор большого собрания. Дверь на лестницу была отворена настежь; слышались крики и споры. Комната Разумихина была довольно большая, собрание же было человек в пятнадцать. Раскольников остановился в прихожей. Тут, за перегородкой, две хозяйские служанки хлопотали около двух больших самоваров, около бутылок, тарелок и блюд с пирогом и закусками, принесенных с хозяйской кухни. Раскольников послал за Разумихиным. Тот прибежал в восторге. С первого взгляда заметно было, что он необыкновенно много выпил, и хотя Разумихин почти никогда не мог напиться допьяна, но на этот раз что-то было заметно.","He easily found Razumikhin; the new tenant was already known in Pochinkov's house, and the janitor immediately showed him the way. From halfway down the stairs one could discern the noise and lively talk of a large assembly. The door to the stairs was wide open; shouts and arguments were heard. Razumikhin's room was rather large, and the meeting consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the hallway. Here, behind a partition, two master's maids busied themselves about two large samovars, near bottles, plates, and dishes of cake and appetizers brought from the master's kitchen. Raskolnikov sent for Razumikhin. He ran in delight. At first glance it was noticeable that he had drunk an unusually large amount, and although Razumikhin could almost never get drunk, something was noticeable this time.","He found Razumikhin easily, as everyone already knew the new lodger in Pochinkov’s house. The doorman showed him the way immediately. Halfway up the stairs he could already hear the noise and lively conversation of the large gathering. The door to the staircase was open wide, and he could hear shouts and arguments. Razumikhin’s room was rather large, and there were about fifteen people gathered in it. Raskolnikov paused in the entryway. There, behind a partition, two of the landlord’s servants were attending to two large samovars next to bottles, plates, and dishes with pies and snacks brought up from the landlord’s kitchen. Raskolnikov asked for Razumikhin. He came running in ecstasy. From the first glance, it was clear that he’d had more to drink than usual. Although Razumikhin could rarely drink enough to get drunk, this time something was amiss.","He had no trouble finding Razumikhin.

At first glance it was apparent that he had had a great deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor could make Razumikhin drunk, this time he was noticeably affected by it."

"– То есть вы этим выражаете, что я хлопочу в свой карман. Не беспокойтесь, Родион Романович, если б я хлопотал в свою выгоду, то не стал бы так прямо высказываться, не дурак же ведь я совсем. На этот счет открою вам одну психологическую странность. Давеча я, оправдывая свою любовь к Авдотье Романовне, говорил, что был сам жертвой. Ну так знайте же, что никакой я теперь любви не ощущаю, н-никакой, так что мне самому даже странно это, потому что я ведь действительно нечто ощущал…","- That is, you express by this that I am busy in my pocket.

Don’t worry, Rodion Romanovich—if I had been acting out of selfishness, I wouldn’t ever have spoken so freely. I’m not a complete fool. But I’ll tell you a strange psychological fact. Just now, when I was justifying my love for Avdotya Romanovna, I said that I was a victim myself.

"«Это оттого, что я очень болен, – угрюмо решил он наконец, – я сам измучил и истерзал себя, и сам не знаю, что делаю… И вчера, и третьего дня, и все это время терзал себя… Выздоровлю и… не буду терзать себя… А ну как совсем и не выздоровлю? Господи! Как это мне все надоело!..» Он шел не останавливаясь. Ему ужасно хотелось как-нибудь рассеяться, но он не знал, что сделать и что предпринять. Одно новое, непреодолимое ощущение овладевало им все более и более почти с каждой минутой: это было какое-то бесконечное, почти физическое, отвращение ко всему встречавшемуся и окружающему, упорное, злобное, ненавистное. Ему гадки были все встречные, – гадки были их лица, походка, движения. Просто наплевал бы на кого-нибудь, укусил бы, кажется, если бы кто-нибудь с ним заговорил…","“It’s because I’m very sick,” he finally decided gloomily, “I tortured myself and tortured myself, and I don’t know what I’m doing ...

One new, irresistible sensation took possession of him more and more almost every minute: it was some kind of endless, almost physical, disgust for everything that met and around, stubborn, spiteful, hateful. Everyone he met was disgusting - their faces, gait, movements were disgusting. I would just spit on anyone, bite, it seems, if someone spoke to him ...","“It’s all because I’m very ill,” he decided gloomily once and for all. “I’ve tortured and tormented myself, and I don’t even know what I’m doing. . . .

I’m so fed up with all this!” He walked without stopping. He very much wanted to distract himself, but didn’t know what to do or what to try. A new, insurmountable feeling was overtaking him more and more with every passing minute: it was some constant, almost physical repulsion for everything that he was encountering and all that surrounded him, a stubborn, malicious, hateful feeling. Everyone he met seemed repulsive to him—their faces, their walk, and their gestures. If someone had begun talking to him, he felt, he might spit at them or bite them . . .","‘That’s because I’m very ill,’ he concluded gloomily at last. ‘I’ve worn myself out and exhausted myself, and I don’t know what I’m doing.

Oh God, I’m so sick of it all!…’ He was walking on without stopping. He desperately wanted to find some distraction, but he had no idea what to do, what to attempt. With every minute that passed, a new and irresistible feeling took an ever firmer hold on him—a boundless, almost physical revulsion towards everything he saw and everything around him, a stubborn, angry sense of loathing. Everyone he met repelled him—their faces, their walk, their movements. He would actually have spat at anyone, perhaps even bitten anyone who spoke to him.","Yes, he had known it all, and understood it all; surely it had all been settled even yesterday at the moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out of it ... Yes, that’s the way it was. “It’s because I’m very ill,” he decided grimly at last, “I’ve been worrying and irritating myself, and I don’t know what I’m doing . . . Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I’ve been worrying myself . . . I’ll get well and I shan’t worry . . . But what if I don’t get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!” He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him every moment; it was an immeasurable, almost physical repulsion for everything surrounding him, a stubborn, malignant feeling of hatred. All who met him were loathsome to him—he loathed their faces, their movements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he might have spat at them or bitten them ."

"– Да постой на минутку, трубочист! Совсем сумасшедший! По мне ведь как хочешь. Видишь ли: уроков и у меня нет, да и наплевать, а есть на Толкучем книгопродавец Херувимов, это уж сам в своем роде урок. Я его теперь на пять купеческих уроков не променяю. Он этакие изданьица делает и естественнонаучные книжонки выпускает, – да как расходятся-то! Одни заглавия чего стоят! Вот ты всегда утверждал, что я глуп, ей-богу, брат, есть глупее меня! Теперь в направление тоже полез; сам ни бельмеса не чувствует, ну а я, разумеется, поощряю. Вот тут два с лишком листа немецкого текста, – по-моему, глупейшего шарлатанства: одним словом, рассматривается, человек ли женщина или не человек? Ну и, разумеется, торжественно доказывается, что человек. Херувимов это по части женского вопроса готовит; я перевожу; растянет он эти два с половиной листа листов на шесть, присочиним пышнейшее заглавие в полстраницы и пустим по полтиннику. Сойдет! За перевод мне по шести целковых с листа, значит, за все рублей пятнадцать достанется, и шесть рублей взял я вперед. Кончим это, начнем об китах переводить, потом из второй части «Confessions»[25] какие-то скучнейшие сплетни тоже отметили, переводить будем; Херувимову кто-то сказал, что будто бы Руссо в своем роде Радищев. Я, разумеется, не противоречу, черт с ним! Ну хочешь второй лист «Человек ли женщина?» переводить? Коли хочешь, так бери сейчас текст, перьев бери, бумаги – все это казенное – и бери три рубля: так как я за весь перевод вперед взял, за первый и за второй лист, то, стало быть, три рубля прямо на твой пай и придутся. А кончишь лист – еще три целковых получишь. Да вот что еще, пожалуйста, за услугу какую-нибудь не считай с моей стороны. Напротив, только что ты вошел, я уж и рассчитал, чем ты мне будешь полезен. Во-первых, я в орфографии плох, во-вторых, в немецком иногда просто швах, так что все больше от себя сочиняю и только тем и утешаюсь, что от этого еще лучше выходит. Ну, а кто его знает, может быть, оно и не лучше, а хуже выходит… Берешь или нет?","- Wait a minute, chimney sweep! Crazy! For me, after all, as you want. You see: I don’t have any lessons, and I don’t give a damn, but there is a bookseller Cherubims on Tolkuchy, this is a lesson in its own way. Now I will not exchange it for five merchant lessons. He makes such a publication and publishes natural science books - but how they diverge! The titles alone are worth something! You have always claimed that I am stupid, by God, brother, there is more stupid than me! Now I climbed in the direction too; he himself does not feel a whitewash, but I, of course, encourage him. Here are more than two sheets of German text - in my opinion, the stupidest quackery: in a word, it is considered whether a woman is a man or not a man? And, of course, it is solemnly proved that a person. Cherubim is preparing this on the part of the woman's question; I'm translating; he will stretch these two and a half sheets of sheets into six, add a magnificent title to half a page and put them in fifty rubles. It will do! For the transfer I get six rubles per sheet, which means that for all the rubles I will get fifteen, and I took six rubles in advance. Let's finish this, start translating about whales, then from the second part of ""Confessions"" [25] we also noted some boring gossip, we will translate; Someone told Cherubimov that it was as if Russo was Radishchev of his own kind. I, of course, do not contradict, to hell with him! Well, you want the second sheet ""Is a woman a man?"" transfer? If you want, then take the text now, take pens, papers - all this is official - and take three rubles: since I took the entire translation in advance, for the first and second pages, then, therefore, three rubles directly for your share and will have to. And if you finish the sheet, you will get three more rubles. But what else, please, don't count it as a favor on my part. On the contrary, as soon as you entered, I already calculated how you would be useful to me. Firstly, I am bad at spelling, and secondly, sometimes in German it’s just stitches, so I’m composing more and more of myself, and the only thing I console myself is that it’s even better. Well, who knows, maybe it’s not better, but it turns out worse ... Do you take it or not?","“Wait a moment, you derelict! You’re completely mad! As far as I’m concerned, you can do as you like. You see, I don’t have any lessons either, but I don’t give a damn; there’s a bookseller at the flea market by the name of Kheruvimov who’s a kind of lesson in himself. I wouldn’t trade him for five lessons in any merchant’s house. He does a little publishing and puts out booklets on the natural sciences—and do they sell! The titles alone are worth the price! You always say that I’m a fool; well, friend, I swear there are bigger fools than me! Now he’s turned toward progressive politics; he hasn’t a clue about it, but I encourage him, of course. Here are some forty pages of a German text—in my opinion, it’s the dumbest charlatanism: in a word, it examines the question of whether a woman can be considered a human being or not. Well, naturally, it demonstrates solemnly that a woman is indeed a human being. Kheruvimov is planning to publish it as a contribution to the woman question; * I’m translating it; he’ll stretch those forty pages to a hundred, we’ll come up with the most splendid title, at least half a page long, and then we’ll sell it for fifty kopecks. It’ll work! I get six rubles for sixteen pages, which means about fifteen rubles for the whole thing, and I got six rubles in advance. After we finish this, we’ll start translating a piece on whales, and then we’ll publish the most boring scandalous sections of the second part of Confessions;† someone told Kheruvimov that Rousseau is like our Radishchev.‡ Of course, I won’t contradict him—the hell with him! Well, how would you like to translate the second part of “Are Women Human Beings?” If you do, then take the text, take some pens and paper— it’s all been provided—and here are three rubles. Since I got an advance on the whole thing, for the first and the second parts, it would come to three rubles for your share. When you finish that part—you’ll get another three rubles. Here’s what else: don’t think I’m doing you any favors. On the contrary, just when you showed up, I was already wondering about how you could help me. In the first place, my spelling is awful; in the second, my German is sometimes simply not up to it, so I make it up and console myself by thinking that the result comes out even better. Who knows, perhaps it’s not any better, but even worse. . . . Will you take it or not?”","‘Just stop a minute, you chimney sweep! You’re raving mad! I mean, you can do as you like for all I care. Look: I don’t have any lessons either, and don’t give a toss; but there’s a bookseller in the flea market,* called Kheruvimov, and he’s a lesson himself in a way. I wouldn’t swap him now for five lessons in a merchant’s house. He does a bit of publishing, and brings out little books on natural science, and they sell like anything! The titles alone are a treasure! There you were, always calling me stupid—but I promise you, old man, there are people stupider than me! And now he’s gone in for modern ideas; of course he hasn’t a clue himself, but I encourage him, naturally. Take these two-and-a-half sheets of German text—if you ask me it’s the stupidest sort of humbug , I mean it’s all about whether a woman is a human being or not. * And of course it proves triumphantly that she’s human. Kheruvimov is bringing it out as a contribution to the Woman question, and I’m translating it. He’ll blow up those two-and-a-half sheets to six, we’ll add a magnificent title page on a half-sheet, and sell the book for half a rouble. And it’ll sell! He pays me six roubles a sheet, so I’ll be paid fifteen roubles for all that, and I’ve had six roubles in advance. When that’s done, we’re going to start translating something about whales, and then we’ve picked out some really boring gossip from Part Two of the Confessions , we’ll be translating that—someone or other has told Kheruvimov that Rousseau is a sort of Radishchev. * And of course I don’t contradict him—what do I care? So, would you like to translate the second sheet of “Is Woman Human?”? Take the text with you now, if you like, and some pens and paper— it’s all on the firm—and you can have three roubles. Since I’ve been paid in advance for the whole translation, both the first and second sheets, that means you get three roubles for your bit. And when you’ve finished the sheet, you get another three roubles. And another thing—don’t imagine that this is some sort of favour I’m doing you. Quite the opposite—as soon as you came in, I reckoned straight away that you could be useful to me. Firstly, I’m not good at spelling, and secondly my German is sometimes quite schwach,* so that I make up a lot of it as I go along, and my only comfort is that I’m probably improving it. Though who knows, perhaps I’m not making it better but actually worse … Do you want it or not?’","“Stay a minute, you idiot! You are a total madman. Do what you like for all I care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I don’t care about that, but there’s a bookseller, Kheruvimov, and he’s what I’ve replaced my lessons with. I wouldn’t exchange him for five of them. He’s doing some kind of publishing, and issuing natural science manuals, and what a circulation they have! Even the titles are worth the money! You always told me I was a fool, but, my God, there are greater fools than I am! Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has any understanding of anything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of the German text—in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses the question, ‘Is woman a human being?’ and, of course, triumphantly proves that she is. Kheruvimov is going to bring out this work as a contribution to the question of women; I am translating it; he will expand these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long and bring it out at half a ruble. It will do! He pays me six rubles per signature, it works out to fifteen rubles for the job, and I’ve had six already in advance. When we have finished this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of the dullest scandals out of the second part of “The Confessions” we have marked for translation; somebody has told Kheruvimov that Rousseau was a kind of Radishchev.21 You can be sure I don’t contradict him, damn him! Well, would you like to do the second signature of ‘ Is woman a human being?’ If you would, take the German and pens and paper—all those are provided—and take three rubles; for as I have had six rubles in advance on the whole thing, three rubles come to you for your share. And when you have finished the signature there will be another three rubles for you. And please don’t think I am doing you a service; quite the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to start with, I am bad at spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes totally lost when I read German, so I make it up as I go along for the most part. The only comfort is that it’s bound to be a change for the better. Though who can tell, maybe it’s sometimes for the worse. Will you take it?”"

Чем кончить? Об этом он не имел и понятия, да и думать не хотел. Он отгонял мысль: мысль терзала его.

Личико девочки было бледное и изнуренное; она окостенела от холода, но «как же она попала сюда? Значит, она здесь спряталась и не спала всю ночь». Он стал ее расспрашивать. Девочка вдруг оживилась и быстро-быстро залепетала ему что-то на своем детском языке. Тут было что-то про «мамасю» и что «мамася плибьет», про какую-то чашку, которую «лязбиля» (разбила). Девочка говорила не умолкая; кое-как можно было угадать из всех этих рассказов, что это нелюбимый ребенок, которого мать, какая-нибудь вечно пьяная кухарка, вероятно из здешней же гостиницы, заколотила и запугала; что девочка разбила мамашину чашку и что до того испугалась, что сбежала еще с вечера; долго, вероятно, скрывалась где-нибудь на дворе, под дождем, наконец пробралась сюда, спряталась за шкафом и просидела здесь в углу всю ночь, плача, дрожа от сырости, от темноты и от страха, что ее теперь больно за все это прибьют. Он взял ее на руки, пошел к себе в нумер, посадил на кровать и стал раздевать. Дырявые башмачонки ее, на босу ногу, были так мокры, как будто всю ночь пролежали в луже. Раздев, он положил ее на постель, накрыл и закутал совсем с головой в одеяло. Она тотчас заснула. Кончив все, он опять угрюмо задумался.","He walked for a long time along the long and narrow corridor, not finding anyone, and was about to call loudly, when suddenly in a dark corner, between an old wardrobe and a door, he saw some strange object, something as if alive. He bent down with a candle and saw a child - a girl of five years, no more, in a dress soaked like a washcloth, trembling and crying. She seemed not to be frightened of Svidrigailov, but looked at him with dull surprise with her large black eyes and occasionally sobbed like children who have been crying for a long time, but have already stopped and even consoled themselves, but meanwhile no, no, and suddenly they will sob again. The little girl's face was pale and emaciated; she was stiff with cold, but “how did she get here? So she hid here and did not sleep all night. He began to question her. The girl suddenly perked up and quickly, quickly babbled something to him in her childish language. There was something about “mama” and that “mama is beating”, about some kind of cup, which she “lazbila” (broken). The girl spoke incessantly; it was somehow possible to guess from all these stories that this was an unloved child whom his mother, some eternally drunk cook, probably from the local hotel, had beaten up and intimidated; that the little girl had broken her mother's cup, and that she was so frightened that she had run away since evening; for a long time, she probably hid somewhere in the yard, in the rain, finally she made her way here, hid behind a closet and sat here in the corner all night, crying, trembling from dampness, from darkness and fear that they would now hurt her for all this. He took her in his arms, went to his room, put her on the bed and began to undress. Her holey shoes, on her bare feet, were so wet, as if they had lain in a puddle all night. Having undressed, he laid her on the bed, covered her and wrapped her head completely in a blanket. She fell asleep at once. Having finished everything, he again thought sullenly.","He walked for a long time down the long, narrow corridor without finding anyone; he was about to shout when suddenly, in a dark corner, between an old wardrobe and the door, he discerned some strange object, something that seemed alive. He leaned over with his candle and noticed that it was a child—a little girl aged five, no more, in a soaking-wet dress, damp as a dishrag, shivering and crying. She seemed not to be afraid of Svidrigaylov, but looked at him with dull wonder from her large black eyes; from time to time she burst into sobs, like a child who has been crying for a long while but has already stopped and even been consoled, but not quite, and then suddenly bursts into sobs again. The little girl’s face was pale and exhausted; she was numb from the cold. “But how did she get here? She must have hidden here and not slept the whole night.” He began to question her; the girl came to life and very quickly began to babble something to him in her childish language. There was something about “Mommy” and “how Mommy will be angry,” and about some cup that was broken. The little girl talked on without stopping; somehow he was able to figure out that she was an unloved child whose mother was a cook and was constantly drunk; she probably worked in that very hotel and was in the habit of frightening and beating the child; the girl had broken a cup belonging to her mother and was so scared that she had run away that very evening; she had probably hidden for a long time in the courtyard in the pouring rain; finally, she had crept in here, hidden behind the wardrobe, and sat there in the corner the whole night—crying, trembling from the damp, the darkness, and from the fear that she would receive a beating for all of this. He picked her up, carried her into his room, sat her on the bed, and began to undress her. The worn shoes on her bare feet were as wet as if she had sat in a puddle the whole night. After undressing her, he put her to bed, covered her, and wrapped her from head to foot in a blanket. She fell asleep immediately. When he finished all this, he relapsed into gloomy thoughts once again.","He spent a long time pacing the long, narrow corridor, without finding anyone. He was about to shout for someone when he caught sight of a strange shape, something that seemed to be alive, in a dark corner between an old wardrobe and a door. He bent down with his candle and saw a child—a girl aged no more than five, wearing a little frock soaked through like a wet dishrag. She was shivering and crying. She didn’t seem frightened of Svidrigailov, but just stared at him in dull surprise, with her big dark eyes, uttering a sob from time to time, as a child does when it has been crying for a long time but has stopped and even calmed down, and yet may suddenly start sobbing again any minute. Her little face was pale and exhausted, and she was stiff with cold. ‘How ever did she get here? She must have hidden here and slept through the whole night!’ He began asking her questions. The girl livened up and lisped something in a hurried, childish voice. There was something about ‘Mamasya’, and how ‘Mamasya will tlash me’, and something else about a cup which the little girl had ‘bwoken’. She chattered on without stopping; it appeared from her tales that she was an unloved child, whom her mother, some sort of a cook who was permanently drunk, and probably worked in this very hotel, had beaten and terrified; the girl had broken Mamasha’s cup and had been so frightened that she’d run away early in the evening; no doubt she’d spent ages hiding somewhere out in the yard, in the rain, and eventually crept in here and hidden behind the cupboard, where she’d crouched in the corner all night, crying, shivering from the damp and the darkness and her terror of being cruelly beaten for what she’d done. He lifted her in his arms and carried her back to his room, sat her on the bed and undressed her. The torn little shoes on her bare feet were as wet as if they’d been lying in a puddle all night. When she was undressed, he laid her on the bed, covered her up, and wrapped her from head to toe in the blanket. She fell asleep straight away. When all was done, he fell into gloomy thoughts again.","He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of Svidrigailov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been crying a long time, but are starting to be comforted. The child’s face was pale and tired, she was numb with cold. “How can she have come here? She must have hidden here and not slept all night.” He began questioning her. The child suddenly became animated, chattered away in her baby language, something about “Mother” and that “Mother would beat her,” and about some cup that she had “bwoken.” The child chattered on without stopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken a cup of her mother’s and was so frightened that she had run away the evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing her. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he sank into dreary musing again."

"Но Раскольников, ожидавший чего-то совсем другого, тупо и задумчиво посмотрел на него и ничего не ответил, как будто имя Петра Петровича слышал он решительно в первый раз.","But Raskolnikov, expecting something completely different, looked at him dully and thoughtfully and did not answer, as if he had heard the name of Pyotr Petrovich for the first time.","But Raskolnikov, expecting something completely different, regarded him vacantly and pensively and made no reply, as if he were definitely hearing Petr Petrovich ’s name for the first time.","Raskolnikov, who had been expecting something quite different, looked at him dully and thoughtfully without saying anything, as though he was hearing the name of Piotr Petrovich for the first time in his life.","But Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he was hearing the name of Peter Petrovich for the first time."

– Ну?,- Well?,“So?”,‘So?’,“Well?”

"Соня знала, что это умирит и успокоит Катерину Ивановну, польстит ей, а главное – гордость ее будет удовлетворена. Она села подле Раскольникова, которому наскоро поклонилась и мельком любопытно на него поглядела. Впрочем, во все остальное время как-то избегала и смотреть на него и говорить с ним. Она была как будто даже рассеянна, хотя так и смотрела в лицо Катерине Ивановне, чтоб угодить ей. Ни она, ни Катерина Ивановна не были в трауре, за неимением платьев; на Соне было какое-то коричневое, потемнее, а на Катерине Ивановне единственное ее платье, ситцевое, темненькое с полосками. Известие о Петре Петровиче прошло как по маслу. Выслушав важно Соню, Катерина Ивановна с той же важностию осведомилась: как здоровье Петра Петровича? Затем, немедленно и чуть не вслух, прошептала Раскольникову, что действительно странно было бы уважаемому и солидному человеку, как Петр Петрович, попасть в такую «необыкновенную компанию», несмотря даже на всю его преданность ее семейству и на старую дружбу его с ее папенькой.","Sonya knew that this would pacify and calm Katerina Ivanovna, flatter her, and most importantly, her pride would be satisfied. She sat down beside Raskolnikov, to whom she bowed hastily and glanced at him curiously. However, during the rest of the time she somehow avoided looking at him and talking to him. She seemed to be even absent-minded, although she looked into Katerina Ivanovna's face in order to please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna were in mourning, for lack of dresses; Sonya was wearing some kind of brown, darker, and Katerina Ivanovna was wearing her only dress, chintz, dark with stripes. The news about Pyotr Petrovich passed like clockwork. Having listened importantly to Sonya, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal importance: how is Pyotr Petrovich's health? Then, immediately and almost aloud, she whispered to Raskolnikov that it would really be strange for a respected and respectable person like Pyotr Petrovich to fall into such an “extraordinary company”, despite all his devotion to her family and his old friendship with her daddy.","Sonya knew that this would pacify and reassure Katerina Ivanovna, flatter her, and—the main thing—her pride would be satisfied. She sat down next to Raskolnikov, to whom she bowed hurriedly, and in passing cast an inquisitive glance at him. However, for the most part she avoided both looking at him and talking to him. She even seemed to be distracted, although she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna’s face and tried to please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna was dressed in mourning, because they lacked the clothes; Sonya was wearing some sort of dark brown dress, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her only dress, a drab cotton dress with stripes. The news about Petr Petrovich was well received. Katerina Ivanovna heard Sonya out pretentiously and, with the same pretentiousness, inquired about Petr Petrovich’s health. Then, quickly and almost out loud, she whispered to Raskolnikov that it really would be strange if a respected and solid man like Petr Petrovich would find himself in such “unusual company,” in spite of all his devotion to her family and his former friendship with her papa.","Sonia knew that this would calm and reassure Katerina Ivanovna, that she’d feel flattered, and above all that her pride would be gratified. She had sat down next to Raskolnikov and made him a hurried bow, while giving him a fleeting and curious look; but otherwise she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She looked almost absent-minded, although she kept watching Katerina Ivanovna’s face to see if she could help her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna was wearing mourning, since they possessed nothing suitable; Sonia was wearing dark brown, while Katerina Ivanovna was wearing the only dress she had, a dark-coloured striped cotton print. The news about Piotr Petrovich was very well received. Katerina listened with dignity to what Sonia told her, and enquired with no less dignity about Piotr Petrovich’s health. Then she went straight on to whisper to Raskolnikov, almost aloud, that it would indeed have been a strange thing for such a respected and well-to-do man as Piotr Petrovich to find himself in such ‘extraordinary company’, for all his devotion to her family and his old friendship with her Papa.","Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, flatter her and satisfy her pride. She sat down beside Raskolnikov; she made him a hurried bow, glancing curiously at him. But for the rest of the time she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemed absent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying to please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get mourning clothes; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna was in her only dress, a dark striped cotton one. The message from Peter Petrovich was very successful.

"– Ах, нет, не говорите так!.. Мы одно, заодно живем, – вдруг опять взволновалась и даже раздражилась Соня, точь-в-точь как если бы рассердилась канарейка или какая другая маленькая птичка. – Да и как же ей быть? Ну как же, как же быть? – спрашивала она, горячась и волнуясь. – А сколько, сколько она сегодня плакала! У ней ум мешается, вы этого не заметили? Мешается; то тревожится, как маленькая, о том, чтобы завтра все прилично было, закуски были и всё… то руки ломает, кровью харкает, плачет, вдруг стучать начнет головой об стену, как в отчаянии. А потом опять утешится, на вас она все надеется: говорит, что вы теперь ей помощник и что она где-нибудь немного денег займет и поедет в свой город, со мною, и пансион для благородных девиц заведет, а меня возьмет надзирательницей, и начнется у нас совсем новая, прекрасная жизнь, и целует меня, обнимает, утешает, и ведь так верит! так верит фантазиям-то! Ну разве можно ей противоречить? А сама-то весь-то день сегодня моет, чистит, чинит, корыто сама, с своею слабенькою-то силой, в комнату втащила, запыхалась, так и упала на постель; а то мы в ряды еще с ней утром ходили, башмачки Полечке и Лене купить, потому у них все развалились, только у нас денег-то и недостало по расчету, очень много недостало, а она такие миленькие ботиночки выбрала, потому у ней вкус есть, вы не знаете… Тут же в лавке так и заплакала, при купцах-то, что недостало… Ах, как было жалко смотреть.","“Ah, no, don’t say that!.. We live together, we live together,” Sonya suddenly became agitated and even irritated again, exactly as if a canary or some other small bird were angry. - Yes, and how can she be? Well, how, how to be? she asked, excited and excited. - And how much, how much she cried today! Her mind is getting in the way, didn't you notice that? gets in the way; sometimes she worries, like a little girl, that tomorrow everything will be decent, there will be snacks and that’s it ... then she breaks her hands, coughs up blood, cries, suddenly starts banging her head against the wall, as if in despair. And then she will console herself again, she keeps counting on you: she says that you are now her assistant and that she will borrow some money somewhere and go to her city with me, and start a boarding school for noble maidens, and take me as a matron, and begin we have a completely new, wonderful life, and he kisses me, hugs me, comforts me, and he believes so! so believes in fantasies! Well, how can you contradict her? And all day today she was washing, cleaning, repairing, dragging the trough herself, with her weak strength, into the room, out of breath, and fell on the bed; otherwise we went to the ranks with her in the morning, to buy shoes for Polechka and Lena, because they all fell apart, only we didn’t have enough money according to the calculation, we were missing a lot, but she chose such nice little shoes, because she has taste , you don’t know ... Right there in the shop she burst into tears, in front of the merchants something that was missing ... Oh, how pitiful it was to look at.","“Oh, no, don’t talk like that! We live in complete harmony,” Sonya said, suddenly agitated again and even irritated, just as if a canary or some other little bird had gotten angry. “What on earth can she do? What else can she do?” she asked, growing heated and upset. “She wept and wept so much today! She’s going mad, didn’t you notice that? She’s so muddled; she’s either agitated like a little girl, hoping that tomorrow everything will be right, the refreshments, and everything else . . . or she wrings her hands, coughs up blood, weeps, and suddenly begins banging her head against the wall, as if in despair. Then she calms down again; she’s relying entirely on you: she says that now you’re her helpmate. She’ll borrow some money from somewhere and go back to her town with me, and she’ll open a boarding school for noble young women; she’ll take me on as a supervisor and we’ll start a splendid new life; she kisses me, hugs me, comforts me, and believes all this! She believes in these fantasies! Well, do I dare contradict her? Meanwhile, she herself washes, cleans, mends, and with her feeble strength drags the washtub into the room, panting, and then has to fall into bed; this morning she and I went to the market stalls to buy some shoes for Polechka and Lenya, because theirs were all worn out, but we didn’t have enough money to pay for them, not nearly enough, and she’d chosen such sweet little shoes, because she has good taste, you just don’t know. . . . She started crying right there in the shop in front of the merchants, because we didn’t have enough money. . . . Ah, it was pitiful to see.”","‘Oh no, please don’t talk like that!… She and I, we’re all one and the same, we share everything’—and she suddenly became agitated and almost angry again, like a canary or any other little bird when it gets its feathers ruffled—‘And what can she do? I ask you, what can she do?’ she asked heatedly and anxiously. ‘ And how she cried today, how she cried! She’s going out of her mind, haven’t you noticed? Sometimes she worries like a little child, wanting to make sure that everything’s right and proper for tomorrow, and there are snacks to eat, and all that… and then she’ll wring her hands, and cough up blood, and weep, and suddenly start banging her head against the wall in despair. And then she calms down again, and puts all her hopes in you: she says you’ll help her, and that she’ll borrow a bit of money somewhere and go back to her home town, and take me with her, and set up a boarding school for young ladies, with me to oversee it, and we’ll start a lovely new life; and she kisses and hugs me, and comforts me—and she really believes it! She believes all those impossible dreams! Well, how can I contradict her? And then she spent all today washing and cleaning and mending; she dragged the tub into the room herself, weak as she is, and got all out of breath and collapsed on the bed. And we’d been to the market* together in the morning to buy little boots for Polechka and Lena* because theirs have all fallen to pieces, but we didn’t have enough money to pay for them , we were just a little bit short, and she’d chosen such dear little boots, because she’s got good taste, you don’t know her… And she burst into tears, right there in the shop, in front of the shopkeepers, because she didn’t have enough… Oh dear, what a sad sight that was.’","“Oh, no, don’t talk like that ... We are one, we live as if we were one.” Sonia was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other little bird were to be angry. “And what could she do? What, what could she do?” she persisted, getting hot and excited. “And how she cried today! Her mind is unhinged, haven’t you noticed it? One minute she is worrying like a child that everything will be right tomorrow, the lunch and all that . . . Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood, weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the wall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in these dreams of hers! You can’t contradict her. And all day long she has been washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went this morning to a store to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida as theirs are completely worn out. Only the money we brought wasn’t enough, not nearly enough. And she picked out such lovely little boots, because she has taste, you don’t know. And there in the store she burst out crying in front of the assistants because she hadn’t enough . . .

"– Да-с, был такой почти точно случай, психологический, в судебной практике нашей-с, болезненный такой случай-с, – продолжал скороговоркой Порфирий. – Тоже наклепал один на себя убийство-с, да еще как наклепал-то: целую галлюсинацию подвел, факты представил, обстоятельства рассказал, спутал, сбил всех и каждого, а чего? Сам он, совершенно неумышленно, отчасти, причиной убийства был, но только отчасти, и как узнал про то, что он убийцам дал повод, затосковал, задурманился, стало ему представляться, повихнулся совсем, да и уверил сам себя, что он-то и есть убийца! Да правительствующий сенат, наконец, дело-то разобрал, и несчастный был оправдан и под призрение отдан. Спасибо правительствующему сенату! Эх-ма, ай-ай-ай! Да этак что же, батюшка? Этак можно и горячку нажить, когда уж этакие поползновения нервы свои раздражать являются, по ночам в колокольчики ходить звонить да про кровь расспрашивать! Эту ведь я психологию-то изучил всю на практике-с. Этак ведь иногда человека из окна или с колокольни соскочить тянет, и ощущение-то такое соблазнительное. Тоже и колокольчики-с… Болезнь, Родион Романович, болезнь! Болезнию своей пренебрегать слишком начали-с. Посоветовались бы вы с опытным медиком, а то что у вас этот толстый-то!.. Бред у вас! Это все у вас просто в бреду одном делается!..","“Yes, sir, there was almost exactly such a case, psychological, in our judicial practice, sir, such a painful case,” Porfiry continued in a patter. - He also riveted a murder on himself, sir, and how he riveted something: he summed up a whole hallucination, presented the facts, told the circumstances, confused, knocked everyone down, but what? He himself, completely unintentionally, in part, was the cause of the murder, but only in part, and as soon as he found out that he had given the killers a pretext, he became melancholy, befuddled, there is a killer! Yes, the ruling Senate, finally, sorted out the matter, and the unfortunate man was acquitted and handed over to charity. Thanks to the ruling Senate! Eh-ma, ah-ah-ah! Yes, so what, father? That way you can get a fever, when such encroachments irritate your nerves, at night go to the bells to ring and ask about blood! After all, I studied all this psychology in practice, sir. After all, sometimes a person is drawn to jump out of a window or from a bell tower, and the feeling is so seductive. The bells, too, sir... Illness, Rodion Romanovich, illness! They began to neglect their illness too much, sir. You should have consulted with an experienced physician, otherwise you have this fat one! .. You have nonsense! All this is done in your delusion alone! ..","“Yes, sir, we had a case that was almost the same in our legal practice, sir, a psychological case, a morbid one, sir,” Porfiry rattled on, speaking very quickly. “That fellow also tried to cast aspersions on himself as a murderer, sir, and this is how he did it: he invented an extensive hallucination, presented facts, explained circumstances, became muddled, and wound up confusing everyone and everything. And what for? He himself, absolutely unintentionally, was partly the cause of the murder, but only in part, and as soon as he learned that he had given the murderers a pretext for the crime, he became miserable, lost the ability to think clearly, began seeing visions, went completely mad, and even persuaded himself that he was the murderer! Finally, the Governing Senate heard the case, and the unfortunate man was acquitted and provided with care. Thanks to the Governing Senate! Oh dear, ay yi yi! So what then, old boy? You can end up with a fever if such impulses happen to irritate your nerves and you go around at night ringing doorbells and asking about blood! I’ve learned all this psychology in my legal practice, sir. In this way a man can sometimes feel inclined to throw himself out a window or jump from a bell tower; the emotion can be very seductive. Same for ringing doorbells. . . . It’s an illness, Rodion Romanovich, an illness! You’ve begun to neglect your illness too much, sir. You ought to consult an experienced doctor, and not that chubby fellow you see! You’re delirious! You’re doing all these things in your delirium!”","‘Yes, there was another case almost exactly like this one, a psychological one, in our forensic practice, a pathological case,’ Porfiry hurried on. ‘This man had also confessed to a murder, and how convincing he made it: reeled out a whole hallucination, came up with all the facts and circumstantial details, he muddled everyone up, confused us all, and what for? He’d been the entirely unwitting cause, in part, of a killing—but only in part; and when he discovered that he’d given the murderers their chance, he got depressed, lost his head, started imagining things, and went right out of his mind; he persuaded himself that he was the actual murderer himself! But eventually the Senate sorted the affair out, and the wretched man was acquitted and put into care. Well done, the Senate! Well, well, oh dear, dear me! So what now, my dear lad? This is the way to get yourself into a high fever—feeling driven to tax your nerves like this, going round at night ringing bells and asking about blood! All that psychology, I’ve studied it on the job. That sort of thing sometimes gives people an urge to jump out of a window or off a bell tower, and it’s such a tempting feeling. Doorbells, too… It’s a sickness, Rodion Romanovich, a sickness! You’re taking far too little care of your sickness. You ought to consult an experienced doctor—what’s the use of that fat fellow of yours?… You’re delirious! All this is delirium, no more nor less!’","“Yes, in our legal practice there was a case which was almost exactly identical, a case of morbid psychology,” Porfiry went on quickly. “A man confessed to murder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he brought forward facts, he imposed upon every one and why? He had been partly, but only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that he had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it got on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he persuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the appeal court went into it and the poor man was acquitted and given proper care. Thanks to the appeal court! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dear friend, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about blood! I’ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the same with bell-ringing . . . It’s all illness, Rodion Romanovich! You have begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced doctor, what’s the good of that fat friend of yours? You are lightheaded! You were delirious when you did all this!”"
"– Ну-с, так вот и извините меня перед нею, что я, по обстоятельствам независящим, принужден манкировать и не буду у вас на блинах… то есть на поминках, несмотря на милый зов вашей мамаши.","“Well, then, excuse me to her that, due to circumstances beyond my control, I am forced to skimp and I won’t be at your pancakes ... that is, at the wake, despite your mother’s sweet call.","“Well, please apologize to her: due to certain unforeseeable circumstances, I’ll be forced to miss the pancakes . . . that is, the funeral feast, in spite of your mama’s kind invitation.”","‘Well, then, please make her my excuses and say that I am prevented by circumstances beyond my control from attending your pancake-feast—your funeral dinner, I mean—despite your mother’s kind invitation.’ ‘Yes indeed, sir; I’ll tell her, sir, right away.’","“Then will you make my apologies to her?

Are you clever, lying here like a sack, with nothing to show for it? Before, you said, you used to teach children; why don’t you do anything now?”","‘A fool she may be, and I’m another; but what about you, clever clogs, lying there like a sack of potatoes, and nobody sees anything of you? You used to say you were going out and giving lessons to children; so why don’t you do anything these days?’","“Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you are so clever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? One time you used to go out, you say, to teach children. But why is it you do nothing now?”"
"– Не помню хорошо; видишь, сестра, я окончательно хотел решиться и много раз ходил близ Невы; это я помню. Я хотел там и покончить, но… я не решился… – прошептал он, опять недоверчиво взглядывая на Дуню.","– I don’t remember well; you see, sister, I finally wanted to make up my mind and many times walked near the Neva; I remember it. I wanted to end it there, but ... I did not dare ... - he whispered, again looking incredulously at Dunya.","“I don’t remember very well; you see, sister, I wanted to decide once and for all. I walked along the Neva several times; that I recall. I wanted to end it all there, but . . . I couldn’t work up the courage to do it . . .” he whispered, once again glancing warily at Dunya.","‘I don’t remember very well. You see, sister, I wanted to come to a final decision, and I kept going back to walk by the Neva; that much I remember. I wanted to put an end to it all there, but… I couldn’t make up my mind to it…’ he whispered, glancing uncertainly at Dunia once more.","“I don’t remember clearly. You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mind once and for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember that I wanted to end it all there, but . . .

"Раскольников пошел прямо и вышел к тому углу на Сенной, где торговали мещанин и баба, разговаривавшие тогда с Лизаветой; но их теперь не было.

"В эту минуту из сеней, сквозь толпу, быстро протеснилась Поленька, бегавшая за сестрой. Она вошла, едва переводя дух от скорого бега, сняла с себя платок, отыскала глазами мать, подошла к ней и сказала: «Идет! на улице встретила!» Мать пригнула ее на колени и поставила подле себя. Из толпы, неслышно и робко, протеснилась девушка, и странно было ее внезапное появление в этой комнате, среди нищеты, лохмотьев, смерти и отчаяния. Она была тоже в лохмотьях; наряд ее был грошовый, но разукрашенный по-уличному, под вкус и правила, сложившиеся в своем особом мире, с ярко и позорно выдающеюся целью. Соня остановилась в сенях у самого порога, но не переходила за порог и глядела как потерянная, не сознавая, казалось, ничего, забыв о своем перекупленном из четвертых рук шелковом, неприличном здесь, цветном платье с длиннейшим и смешным хвостом, и необъятном кринолине, загородившем всю дверь, и о светлых ботинках, и об омбрельке,[36] ненужной ночью, но которую она взяла с собой, и о смешной соломенной круглой шляпке с ярким огненного цвета пером. Из-под этой надетой мальчишески набекрень шляпки выглядывало худое, бледное и испуганное личико с раскрытым ртом и с неподвижными от ужаса глазами. Соня была малого роста, лет восемнадцати, худенькая, но довольно хорошенькая блондинка, с замечательными голубыми глазами. Она пристально смотрела на постель, на священника; она тоже задыхалась от скорой ходьбы. Наконец, шушуканье, некоторые слова в толпе, вероятно, до нее долетели. Она потупилась, переступила шаг через порог и стала в комнате, но опять-таки в самых дверях.","At that moment, out of the passage, through the crowd, Polenka quickly made her way, running after her sister. She entered, barely taking a breath from her quick run, took off her handkerchief, found her mother with her eyes, went up to her and said: “Coming! met on the street! Her mother bent her to her knees and placed her beside her. From the crowd, inaudibly and timidly, a girl made her way, and it was strange her sudden appearance in this room, among poverty, rags, death and despair. She, too, was in tatters; her outfit was cheap, but decorated in a street style, according to the taste and rules that had developed in her own special world, with a brightly and shamefully prominent goal. Sonya stopped in the passage at the very threshold, but did not cross the threshold and looked as if lost, not realizing anything, it seemed, forgetting about her silk dress bought from fourth hands, indecent here, colored dress with a long and ridiculous tail, and an immense crinoline that blocked all the way through the door, and about light-coloured boots, and about the ombrelka,[36] an unnecessary night, but which she took with her, and about a funny straw hat with a bright fiery feather. From under this hat, worn on a boyish side, peeped out a thin, pale and frightened little face with an open mouth and eyes motionless with horror. Sonya was small, eighteen years old, thin, but rather pretty blonde, with wonderful blue eyes. She gazed fixedly at the bed, at the priest; she, too, was out of breath from her quick walk. Finally, whispering, some of the words in the crowd probably got through to her. She lowered her eyes, stepped over the threshold, and stood in the room, but again at the very door.","At that moment from the entrance, Polyenka, who had gone to fetch her sister, pushed hastily through the crowd. She entered, still gasping for breath from racing home, took off her shawl, searched with her eyes for her mother, went up to her and said, “She’s coming! I found her on the street!” Her mother made her kneel down and placed her nearby. From the crowd, silently and timidly, a young woman forced her way in; her sudden appearance in this room was strange, amid the poverty, ragged clothes, death, and desperation. She was also wearing tattered clothes; her apparel was shoddy, but she was decked out in the manner of the streets, with the taste and style characteristic of her own particular sphere, with an obvious and shameful purpose. Sonya paused at the threshold, but didn’t cross it and looked like a lost soul. She seemed to be unaware of everything, having forgotten about her fourth-hand colorful silk dress, so inappropriate here, with its long, comical train, its enormous crinoline blocking the whole door, her light-colored shoes, her little parasol, unnecessary at night, but which she carried with her, and her ridiculous round straw hat with its bright fiery-colored feather. From under this hat, which she was wearing with a boyish tilt to one side, there peeked a thin, pale, frightened little face with a gaping mouth and eyes fixed with a look of horror. Sonya was about eighteen years old and not very tall; she was thin, but rather pretty, with fair hair and remarkable blue eyes. She stared intently at the bed and at the priest; she was also panting from running so fast. At last the whispering, some words spoken by someone in the crowd, probably reached her ears. She lowered her eyes, stepped across the threshold, and entered the room, though still remaining near the doorway.","At that moment Polenka appeared in the doorway, briskly pushing her way through the crowd on her way back from fetching her sister. She came in, panting for breath after running so fast, took off her headscarf, looked round for her mother, went up to her and said: ‘She’s coming! I met her in the street!’ Her mother pressed her down onto her knees by her side. And out from the crowd, silently and timidly, a girl edged forward; her sudden appearance in this room was a strange sight, in the midst of abject poverty, rags, death, and despair. She too was in rags; her clothing was cheap and gaudy, as befitted her trade, and was governed by the taste and principles that held sway in her particular world; its shameful purpose blatantly displayed. Sonia stood still in the doorway, not crossing the threshold; she looked around her in bewilderment, seemingly not taking anything in; forgetting about her fourth-hand brightly-coloured silk dress, so unseemly here with its ridiculously long train, and the enormous crinoline that blocked the whole doorway, and her light-coloured boots and little parasol which she was carrying though it served no purpose at night, and her absurd round straw hat with its bright flame-coloured plume. Under this rakishly tilted hat there peeped out a thin, pale, frightened little face, open-mouthed, with eyes frozen in horror. Sonia was a small, thin but quite attractive girl of eighteen, fair-haired and with splendid blue eyes. Out of breath with running, she stood staring at the bed and the priest. Eventually some whispering in the crowd, some words that were spoken, penetrated to her; she cast down her eyes, stepped across the threshold, and stood inside the room, still right next to the door.","At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for her mother, went up to her and said, “She’s coming, I met her in the street.” Her mother made her kneel beside her. Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd, and her appearance in that room was strange, in the midst of want, rags, death and despair. She too was in rags, her clothing was all made of the cheapest material, but decked out in gutter finery of a special kind, unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything. She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the whole doorway, and her light-colored shoes, and the parasol she brought with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat with its flaring flame-colored feather. Under this flirtatiously tilted hat was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in terror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather pretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the priest; she too was out of breath from running. At last whispers, some words in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door."

Raskolnikov looked in horror at the hook of the constipation jumping in the loop and with dull fear waited that the constipation was about to jump out.

Raskolnikov stared in horror as the bolt jiggled in its latch, and he waited with dull fear for the bolt to pop out. In fact, that seemed very possible, the tugging was so violent. He quickly thought about holding the bolt with his hand, but then he would guess what was happening.

Raskolnikov watched in horror as the bolt handle shook up and down in its socket, and waited in numb terror for it to come out. It really seemed as if that might happen, so vigorously was it being shaken. He thought of holding the bolt in place with his hand—but then the other one might guess. His head seemed to be starting to spin again. ‘I’m going to fall down!’ he thought; but the stranger spoke, and Raskolnikov at once recollected himself.","As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of something moving in the room.

Воротилась она – ее откуда-то, кажется, выгнали, может, и прибили… по крайней мере так кажется… Она бегала к начальнику Семена Захарыча, дома не застала; он обедал у какого-то тоже генерала… Вообразите, она махнула туда, где обедали… к этому другому генералу, и, вообразите, – таки настояла, вызвала начальника Семена Захарыча, да, кажется, еще из-за стола.

Теперь она всем рассказывает, и Амалии Ивановне, только трудно понять, кричит и бьется… Ах да: она говорит и кричит, что так как ее все теперь бросили, то она возьмет детей и пойдет на улицу, шарманку носить, а дети будут петь и плясать, и она тоже, и деньги собирать, и каждый день под окно к генералу ходить… «Пусть, говорит, видят, как благородные дети чиновного отца по улицам нищими ходят!» Детей всех бьет, те плачут. Леню учит петь «Хуторок», мальчика плясать, Полину Михайловну тоже, рвет все платья; делает им какие-то шапочки, как актерам; сама хочет таз нести, чтобы колотить, вместо музыки… Ничего не слушает… Вообразите, как же это?

"Когда он вошел к Соне, уже начинались сумерки. Весь день Соня прождала его в ужасном волнении. Они ждали вместе с Дуней. Та пришла к ней еще с утра, вспомнив вчерашние слова Свидригайлова, что Соня «об этом знает». Не станем передавать подробностей разговора, и слез обеих женщин, и насколько сошлись они между собой. Дуня из этого свидания по крайней мере вынесла одно утешение, что брат будет не один: к ней, Соне, к первой пришел он со своею исповедью; в ней искал он человека, когда ему понадобился человек; она же и пойдет за ним, куда пошлет судьба. Она и не спрашивала, но знала, что это будет так. Она смотрела на Соню даже с каким-то благоговением и сначала почти смущала ее этим благоговейным чувством, с которым к ней относилась. Соня готова была даже чуть не заплакать: она, напротив, считала себя недостойною даже взглянуть на Дуню. Прекрасный образ Дуни, когда та откланялась ей с таким вниманием и уважением во время их первого свидания у Раскольникова, с тех пор навеки остался в душе ее как одно из самых прекрасных и недосягаемых видений в ее жизни.","When he entered Sonya, twilight was already beginning. All day Sonya waited for him in terrible agitation. They waited together with Dunya. She came to her in the morning, remembering Svidrigailov's words yesterday that Sonya ""knows about it."" We will not pass on the details of the conversation, and the tears of both women, and how much they agreed with each other. Dunya at least took out one consolation from this meeting, that her brother would not be alone: he was the first to come to her, Sonya, with his confession; in her he looked for a man when he needed a man; she will follow him wherever fate sends him. She didn't ask, but she knew it would be so. She even looked at Sonya with a kind of reverence and at first almost embarrassed her with this reverent feeling with which she treated her. Sonya was even ready to almost cry: she, on the contrary, considered herself unworthy even to look at Dunya. The beautiful image of Dunya, when she bowed to her with such attention and respect during their first meeting with Raskolnikov, has since forever remained in her soul as one of the most beautiful and inaccessible visions in her life.","When he went to see Sonya, it was already twilight. Sonya had been waiting for him all day in horrible agitation. She and Dunya were waiting together. Dunya had come to her that morning, after recalling Svidrigaylov’s words yesterday that Sonya “knows about this.” We won’t convey all the details of their conversation and the tears of these two women, or how close they had become. From this meeting Dunya took away at least one consolation: that her brother would not be alone. He had gone to her first, to Sonya, with his confession; in her he’d sought another person, when he’d needed to find one; she would follow after him wherever fate sent him. Dunya didn’t have to ask, but she knew that this would be so.

Dunia didn’t even ask about this—she knew it would be so. She even regarded Sonia with something like reverence, and rather embarrassed her by treating her with such profound respect. Sonia almost burst into tears at this, feeling herself unworthy even to look at Dunia. The lovely image of Dunia when she bowed to her so graciously and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s lodgings had lived in her heart ever since, as one of the most beautiful and unattainable visions of her life.","WHEN HE ENTERED SONIA’S room, it was already getting dark.

"Небольшая комната, в которую прошел молодой человек, с желтыми обоями, геранями и кисейными занавесками на окнах, была в эту минуту ярко освещена заходящим солнцем. «И тогда, стало быть, так же будет солнце светить!..» – как бы невзначай мелькнуло в уме Раскольникова, и быстрым взглядом окинул он все в комнате, чтобы по возможности изучить и запомнить расположение. Но в комнате не было ничего особенного. Мебель, вся очень старая и из желтого дерева, состояла из дивана с огромною выгнутою деревянною спинкой, круглого стола овальной формы перед диваном, туалета с зеркальцем в простенке, стульев по стенам да двух-трех грошовых картинок в желтых рамках, изображавших немецких барышень с птицами в руках, – вот и вся мебель. В углу перед небольшим образом горела лампада. Все было очень чисто: и мебель и полы были оттерты под лоск; все блестело. «Лизаветина работа», – подумал молодой человек. Ни пылинки нельзя было найти во всей квартире. «Это у злых и старых вдовиц бывает такая чистота», – продолжал про себя Раскольников и с любопытством покосился на ситцевую занавеску перед дверью во вторую крошечную комнатку, где стояли старухины постель и комод и куда он еще ни разу не заглядывал. Вся квартира состояла из этих двух комнат.","The small room into which the young man entered, with yellow wallpaper, geraniums and muslin curtains on the windows, was at that moment brightly lit by the setting sun. ""And then, therefore, the sun will shine in the same way! .."" - as if by chance flashed in Raskolnikov's mind, and with a quick glance he looked around everything in the room in order to study and remember the location as much as possible. But there was nothing special about the room. The furniture, all very old and made of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge curved wooden back, a round oval table in front of the sofa, a toilet with a mirror in the pillar, chairs on the walls, and two or three penny pictures in yellow frames depicting German young ladies with birds in the hands - that's all the furniture. An icon lamp was burning in the corner in front of a small image. Everything was very clean: both furniture and floors were polished; everything shone. ""Lizavet's job,"" thought the young man. Not a speck of dust could be found in the entire apartment. “It’s that evil and old widows have such cleanliness,” Raskolnikov continued to himself, and with curiosity looked sideways at the chintz curtain in front of the door to the second tiny room, where the old women’s bed and chest of drawers stood and where he had never looked. The whole apartment consisted of these two rooms.","The small room, into which the young man stepped, with its yellow wallpaper, geraniums, and muslin curtains on the windows, was at that moment brightly illuminated by the setting sun. “Then, of course, the sun will be shining the same way!” flashed through Raskolnikov’s mind, and he cast a swift glance at everything in the room to take it all in and remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in there. The furniture, all very old and made of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with an enormous carved wooden back, an oval table in front of it, a dressing table with a pier mirror standing between the windows, chairs along the walls, and two or three cheap pictures in yellow frames depicting young German ladies with birds in their hands—that’s all the furniture there was. A lamp was burning in the corner in front of a small icon. Everything in the room was very clean: the furniture and floors had been polished to a high gloss; everything gleamed. “Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man. It was impossible to find even one speck of dust in the whole place. “This is the kind of cleanliness that can be found in the apartments of wicked old widows,” Raskolnikov thought to himself, and with curiosity he cast a sidelong glance at the cotton curtain hanging in front of the door into a second little room, which contained the old woman’s bed and dresser, and into which he’d never looked. The whole apartment consisted of these two rooms.","The young man stepped into a small room with yellowed wallpaper, a few geraniums, and net curtains over the windows. At the moment it was brightly lit by the setting sun. ‘ So then the sun’ll be shining just like this!’ was the thought that sprang unbidden to Raskolnikov’s mind, as he quickly scanned the contents of the room to fix the layout in his memory. But there was nothing particular here. The furniture, all very old and made of yellow wood, consisted of a divan with a high curved wooden back, and an oval table in front of it; between the windows there was a dressing table with a mirror, chairs stood by the walls, and there were two or three minuscule pictures in yellowing frames depicting young German ladies with birds in their hands. Nothing else. In one corner a lamp was burning before a small icon. Everything was very clean. The furniture and floors were highly polished and shining. ‘ That’s Lizaveta’s work,’ thought the young man. There wasn’t a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat. ‘It’s cruel old widows who keep everything this clean,’ Raskolnikov went on to himself, looking inquisitively at the muslin curtain over the doorway into the second, tiny room where the old woman had her bed and chest of drawers. He had never managed to see into that room. Those two rooms made up the whole flat.","The little room the young man walked into, with yellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly lit up at that moment by the setting sun. “So the sun will shine like this then too!” flashed as it were by chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The furniture, all very old and made of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-table with a mirror fixed on it between the windows, chairs along the walls and two or three cheap prints in yellow frames, representing German maidens with birds in their hands—that was all. In the corner a light was burning in front of a small icon. Everything was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished; everything shone. “Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole apartment. “It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such cleanliness,” Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in which stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he had never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole apartment."

"Итак, Порфирий сам еще и разъяснял Разумихину, психологически ему разъяснял! Опять свою проклятую психологию подводить начал! Порфирий-то? Да чтобы Порфирий поверил хоть на одну минуту, что Миколка виновен, после того, что между ними было тогда, после той сцены, глаз на глаз, до Миколки, на которую нельзя найти правильного толкования, кроме одного? (Раскольникову несколько раз в эти дни мелькалась и вспоминалась клочками вся эта сцена с Порфирием; в целом он бы не мог вынести воспоминания.) Были в то время произнесены между ними такие слова, произошли такие движения и жесты, обменялись они такими взглядами, сказано было кой-что таким голосом, доходило до таких пределов, что уж после этого не Миколке (которого Порфирий наизусть с первого слова и жеста угадал), не Миколке было поколебать самую основу его убеждений.","So, Porfiry himself also explained to Razumikhin, psychologically explained to him! Again his damned psychology began to fail! Porfiry something? Yes, for Porfiry to believe for even one minute that Mikolka is guilty, after what happened between them then, after that scene, eye to eye, to Mikolka, for which it is impossible to find a correct interpretation, except for one? (Raskolnikov several times these days flashed and recalled in fragments this whole scene with Porfiry; on the whole, he could not bear the recollection.) Such words were uttered between them at that time, such movements and gestures took place, they exchanged such glances, it was said something in such a voice reached such extremes that after that it was not Mikolka (whom Porfiry guessed by heart from the first word and gesture), not Mikolka to shake the very foundation of his convictions.","So, Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumikhin, explained it to him psychologically! Once again he had begun to bring in his damned psychology! Porfiry? How could Porfiry believe, even for a moment, that Mikolka was guilty, after what had taken place between them then, after that scene, face-to-face, before Mikolka arrived? Surely it was impossible to arrive at any other correct interpretation except for one. (Several times during the last few days, Raskolnikov had recalled fleetingly, in snatches, that scene with Porfiry; he couldn’t bear thinking about it as a whole.) The words exchanged between them at that time, the movements and gestures that occurred, the glances exchanged, the tone of voice employed had reached such a point that after this it wasn’t for Mikolka (whom Porfiry had understood completely from his very first word and gesture), it wasn’t for Mikolka to shake the basis of his convictions.","So, Porfiry himself had explained things to Razumikhin—explained them psychologically! Yet again, he’d begun bringing in his damned psychology! Porfiry? Him? The very idea that Porfiry might believe, even for a moment, that Mikolka was guilty, after what had passed between the two of them at the time—their tête-à-tête, before Mikolka arrived: a conversation which could only possibly be interpreted that way… (During the past few days, Raskolnikov had several times recalled scraps and fragments of that scene with Porfiry, though he couldn’t bear to remember the whole of it.) Words had passed between them then, and movements, and gestures, and such looks had been exchanged, and things pronounced in such tones, and they had taken the matter to such a point, that after that no Mikolka (whom Porfiry had seen through, right from his very first word and gesture), no Mikolka was going to succeed in shaking the very foundations of what Porfiry firmly believed.","“And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumikhin, had explained it psychologically. He had started bringing in his damned psychology again! Porfiry? But to think that Porfiry should for a moment believe that Nikolai was guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolai ’s appearance, after that one-on-one interview, which could have only one explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled passages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind rest on it.) Such words, such gestures had passed between them, they had exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and had reached such a pass, that Nikolai, whom Porfiry had seen through at the first word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his conviction."

"Он перекрестился несколько раз. Соня схватила свой платок и накинула его на голову. Это был зеленый драдедамовый платок, вероятно тот самый, про который упоминал тогда Мармеладов, «фамильный». У Раскольникова мелькнула об этом мысль, но он не спросил. Действительно, он уже сам стал чувствовать, что ужасно рассеян и как-то безобразно встревожен. Он испугался этого.

It was a green drapedam handkerchief, probably the same one that Marmeladov mentioned then, ""family"". Raskolnikov thought about this, but he did not ask.

"Ему вдруг почему-то вспомнилось, как давеча, за час до исполнения замысла над Дунечкой, он рекомендовал Раскольникову поручить ее охранению Разумихина. «В самом деле, я, пожалуй, пуще для своего собственного задора тогда это говорил, как и угадал Раскольников. А шельма, однако ж, этот Раскольников! Много на себе перетащил. Большою шельмой может быть со временем, когда вздор повыскочит, а теперь слишком уж жить ему хочется! Насчет этого пункта этот народ – подлецы. Ну да черт с ним, как хочет, мне что».","For some reason, he suddenly remembered how just now, an hour before the execution of the plan for Dunechka, he recommended to Raskolnikov to entrust her with the protection of Razumikhin. “In fact, I, perhaps, spoke more for my own enthusiasm then, as Raskolnikov guessed. A rogue, however, this Raskolnikov! Carried a lot. He can be a big rogue in time, when nonsense rises, but now he wants to live too much! As regards this point, these people are scoundrels. Well, to hell with him, as he wants, what do I want.","Suddenly, for some reason he recalled, as he had earlier, an hour before he’d carried out his plan for Dunechka, that he had advised Raskolnikov to entrust her well-being to Razumikhin. “As a matter of fact, I probably said that more for my own zeal, as Raskolnikov had guessed. That Raskolnikov’s a rascal! He’s experienced a lot of trouble in his life. He may eventually become a proper rascal in time, when that nonsense has vanished, but now he’s too eager to live! Concerning this point, such people are rascals. Well, the hell with him; let him do as he likes; what’s it to me?”","For some reason he suddenly remembered that a little while back, an hour before making his attempt on Dunechka, he had recommended Raskolnikov to entrust her to Razumikhin’s care. ‘Actually I said that mostly to tease myself, as Raskolnikov guessed.

He could grow into a great scoundrel with time, when he gets all the nonsense out of him; but at the moment he’s too keen to stay alive! People like him are all cowards in that way.

"– Это, собственно, судейский слог, – перебил Разумихин, – судейские бумаги до сих пор так пишутся.","- This is, in fact, the judicial syllable, - Razumikhin interrupted, - judicial papers are still written like that.","“It’s in a special lawyerly style,” Razumikhin said, interrupting her. “Legal documents are still written like that.”","‘That’s actually legal language,’ interrupted Razumikhin; ‘legal papers are still written like that to this day.’","“That’s just the jargon of the courts,” Razumikhin put in. “Legal documents have always been written like that.”"

It was you who told me to go to the crossroads; why is it you are frightened now it’s come to that?”"

"Еще в начале процесса мать Раскольникова сделалась больна. Дуня и Разумихин нашли возможным увезти ее из Петербурга на все время суда. Разумихин выбрал город на железной дороге и в близком расстоянии от Петербурга, чтоб иметь возможность регулярно следить за всеми обстоятельствами процесса и в то же время как можно чаще видеться с Авдотьей Романовной. Болезнь Пульхерии Александровны была какая-то странная, нервная и сопровождалась чем-то вроде помешательства, если не совершенно, то, по крайней мере, отчасти. Дуня, воротившись с последнего свидания с братом, застала мать уже совсем больною, в жару и в бреду. В этот же вечер сговорилась она с Разумихиным, что именно отвечать матери на ее расспросы о брате, и даже выдумала вместе с ним, для матери, целую историю об отъезде Раскольникова куда-то далеко, на границу России, по одному частному поручению, которое доставит ему, наконец, и деньги и известность. Но их поразило, что ни об чем этом сама Пульхерия Александровна ни тогда, ни потом не расспрашивала. Напротив, у ней у самой оказалась целая история о внезапном отъезде сына; она со слезами рассказывала, как он приходил к ней прощаться; давала при этом знать намеками, что только ей одной известны многие весьма важные и таинственные обстоятельства и что у Роди много весьма сильных врагов, так что ему надо даже скрываться. Что же касается до будущей карьеры его, то она тоже казалась ей несомненною и блестящею, когда пройдут некоторые враждебные обстоятельства; уверяла Разумихина, что сын ее будет со временем даже человеком государственным, что доказывает его статья и его блестящий литературный талант. Статью эту она читала беспрерывно, читала иногда даже вслух, чуть не спала вместе с нею, а все-таки, где именно находится теперь Родя, почти не расспрашивала, несмотря даже на то, что с нею, видимо, избегали об этом разговаривать, – что уже одно могло возбудить ее мнительность. Стали, наконец, бояться этого странного молчания Пульхерии Александровны насчет некоторых пунктов. Она, например, даже не жаловалась на то, что от него нет писем, тогда как прежде, живя в своем городке, только и жила одною надеждой и одним ожиданием получить поскорее письмо от возлюбленного Роди. Последнее обстоятельство было уж слишком необъяснимо и сильно беспокоило Дуню; ей приходила мысль, что мать, пожалуй, предчувствует что-нибудь ужасное в судьбе сына и боится расспрашивать, чтобы не узнать чего-нибудь еще ужаснее. Во всяком случае, Дуня ясно видела, что Пульхерия Александровна не в здравом состоянии рассудка.","Even at the beginning of the process, Raskolnikov's mother became ill. Dunya and Razumikhin found it possible to take her away from Petersburg for the duration of the trial. Razumikhin chose a city on the railroad and at a close distance from Petersburg, in order to be able to regularly follow all the circumstances of the process and at the same time see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna's illness was somehow strange, nervous, and was accompanied by something like insanity, if not completely, then at least in part. Dunya, returning from her last meeting with her brother, found her mother already quite ill, feverish and delirious. On the same evening, she agreed with Razumikhin what exactly to answer her mother to her questions about her brother, and even invented with him, for her mother, a whole story about Raskolnikov’s departure somewhere far away, to the border of Russia, on one private assignment, which will deliver him, finally, and money and fame. But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna herself did not ask about any of this either then or later. On the contrary, she herself had a whole story about her son's sudden departure; she told with tears how he came to her to say goodbye; at the same time, she gave hints that she alone knew many very important and mysterious circumstances and that Rodya had many very strong enemies, so that he even had to hide. As for his future career, it also seemed to her undoubted and brilliant when certain hostile circumstances passed; assured Razumikhin that her son would eventually even be a statesman, as his article and his brilliant literary talent prove. She read this article incessantly, sometimes even read it aloud, almost slept with her, but still, where exactly Rodya was now, she hardly asked, despite the fact that they apparently avoided talking to her about it - that alone could arouse her suspiciousness. They finally began to fear this strange silence of Pulcheria Alexandrovna on certain points. She, for example, did not even complain about the fact that there were no letters from him, whereas before, living in her town, she lived only with one hope and one expectation to receive a letter from her beloved Rody as soon as possible. The last circumstance was too inexplicable and greatly worried Dunya; the thought came to her that the mother, perhaps, foresaw something terrible in the fate of her son and was afraid to ask, so as not to find out something even more terrible. In any case, Dunya clearly saw that Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not in her right state of mind.","At the very beginning of the trial, Raskolnikov’s mother became ill. Dunya and Razumikhin used it as an opportunity to remove her from Petersburg during the trial. Razumikhin chose a town along the railway close to Petersburg in order to have the chance to follow regularly the entire course of the trial and at the same time to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna’s illness was a strange nervous ailment and was accompanied by something like insanity, if not completely, then at least partially. Dunya, returning from her last meeting with her brother, found her mother very ill, in a fever and delirious. That evening she conferred with Razumikhin about how to reply to her mother’s questions about her brother, and even conceived with him a whole account about Raskolnikov’s departure to somewhere far away, at Russia’s frontier, on a private mission that would eventually bring him both wealth and fame. But they were surprised that Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna didn’t ask anything more about it, either then or later. On the contrary, she herself invented an entire story to explain the sudden disappearance of her son: she would tearfully narrate how he had come to say farewell to her; she hinted that only she knew the many extremely important and mysterious circumstances; she said that Rodya had a great deal of very powerful enemies and, therefore, had to keep himself hidden away. As far as his future career was concerned, it also seemed indisputable and brilliant, once certain hostile circumstances were removed; she convinced Razumikhin that her son would in time even become a man of state, which was demonstrated by his article and his brilliant literary talent. She read his article over and over, even read it aloud sometimes, practically slept with it; still, she hardly inquired as to where exactly Rodya was now, in spite of the fact they were obviously avoiding that subject with her—that fact alone should have aroused her suspicions. At last they began to fear Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna’s strange silence on several points. For example, she didn’t even complain that there were no letters from him, whereas previously, back in their little town, she’d lived only in hope and expectation of receiving a letter as soon as possible from her beloved Rodya. This last circumstance was too inexplicable and disturbed Dunya a great deal; it occurred to her that her mother, perhaps, had a foreboding of something terrible in her son’s fate and that she was afraid to ask, so as not to find out something even more terrible. In any case, Dunya clearly saw that Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna was not in her right mind.","At the very beginning of the trial, Raskolnikov’s mother fell ill. Dunia and Razumikhin managed to move her out of Petersburg for the whole duration of the trial. Razumikhin chose a town on the railway line, not far from Petersburg, so that he could follow every step of the trial and yet see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulkheria Alexandrovna’s illness was a strange sort of nervous disorder, accompanied by what looked like at least partial, if not complete, mental derangement. Dunia, on returning from her latest visit to her brother, found her mother seriously ill, feverish and delirious. That same evening she and Razumikhin agreed on what to tell her mother when she asked about her son; together they concocted a whole story for her about how Raskolnikov had left for somewhere far away on the Russian frontier, on a private mission which would eventually earn him fame and fortune. But they were much struck by the fact that Pulkheria Alexandrovna herself never asked them any questions about all this, neither at the time nor later on. Instead, she herself came up with a whole story about her son’s sudden departure, telling with tears in her eyes how he had come to take his leave of her, and dropping hints that there were many very important and secret facts known to her alone, and that Rodia had many very powerful enemies, so that he was obliged to hide away. As for his future career, she too apparently saw it as secure and brilliantly successful, once he had overcome some adverse circumstances; she assured Razumikhin that her son would in time actually become a statesman, as proved by his magazine article and his outstanding literary talent. She was constantly reading that article; sometimes she even read it aloud; she almost took it to bed with her; and yet she almost never asked where exactly Rodia was now, despite the fact that people clearly avoided talking to her about that—something that might itself have aroused her suspicions. Eventually they became anxious about Pulkheria Alexandrovna’s silence on certain matters. For instance, she never complained that no letters came from him, although when she had been living in her little town earlier on, the hope and expectation of soon getting a letter from her adored Rodia had been all she lived for. This last fact was too inexplicable, and greatly worried Dunia; she came to think that her mother had a presentiment of something terrible happening to her son, and was afraid to ask questions for fear of hearing something even more dreadful. At all events, Dunia could clearly see that Pulkheria Alexandrovna was not in her right mind.","At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s mother fell ill. Dunia and Razumikhin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the trial. Razumikhin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time to see Avdotia Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial derangement of her intellect. When Dunia returned from her last interview with her brother, she had found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium. That evening Razumikhin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother’s questions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her mother’s benefit that he had to go away to a distant part of Russia on a business commission, which would eventually bring him money and renown. But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never asked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter. On the contrary, she had her own version of her son’s sudden departure; she told them with tears how he had come to say goodbye to her, hinting that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodia had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be in hiding. As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. She assured Razumikhin that her son would one day be a great statesman, that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it. She read this article continually , she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed with her, but scarcely asked where Rodia was, though the subject was obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken her suspicions. They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s strange silence on certain subjects. She did not, for instance, complain that she never received any letters from him, though in previous years she had lived solely on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodia. This was a cause of great uneasiness to Dunia; the idea occurred to her that her mother suspected that there was something terrible in her son’s fate and was afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. In any case, Dunia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of her faculties."

"Он стоял, смотрел и не верил глазам своим: дверь, наружная дверь, из прихожей на лестницу, та самая, в которую он давеча звонил и вошел, стояла отпертая, даже на целую ладонь приотворенная: ни замка, ни запора, все время, во все это время!

And although he had previously been overcome by a longing for human contact of any kind whatever, he now, at the very first word actually addressed to him, suddenly experienced his usual feeling of disagreeable irritation and revulsion towards any stranger who intruded, or merely threatened to intrude, on his personal world.","“No, I am studying,” answered the young man, somewhat surprised at the grand style of the speaker and also at being so directly addressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for company of any sort, when he was actually spoken to he felt his habitual irritable uneasiness at any stranger who approached or attempted to approach him."

"Среди комнаты стояла Лизавета, с большим узлом в руках, и смотрела в оцепенении на убитую сестру, вся белая как полотно и как бы не в силах крикнуть. Увидав его выбежавшего, она задрожала, как лист, мелкою дрожью, и по всему лицу ее побежали судороги; приподняла руку, раскрыла было рот, но все-таки не вскрикнула и медленно, задом, стала отодвигаться от него в угол, пристально, в упор, смотря на него, но все не крича, точно ей воздуху недоставало, чтобы крикнуть. Он бросился на нее с топором: губы ее перекосились так жалобно, как у очень маленьких детей, когда они начинают чего-нибудь пугаться, пристально смотрят на пугающий их предмет и собираются закричать. И до того эта несчастная Лизавета была проста, забита и напугана раз навсегда, что даже руки не подняла защитить себе лицо, хотя это был самый необходимо-естественный жест в эту минуту, потому что топор был прямо поднят над ее лицом. Она только чуть-чуть приподняла свою свободную левую руку, далеко не до лица, и медленно протянула ее к нему вперед, как бы отстраняя его. Удар пришелся прямо по черепу, острием, и сразу прорубил всю верхнюю часть лба, почти до темени. Она так и рухнулась. Раскольников совсем было потерялся, схватил ее узел, бросил его опять и побежал в прихожую.","Lizaveta stood in the middle of the room, with a large bundle in her hands, and looked in a daze at her murdered sister, all white as a sheet and as if unable to shout. Seeing him run out, she trembled like a leaf, with a small shiver, and convulsions ran all over her face; She raised her hand, opened her mouth, but still did not cry out and slowly, backwards, began to move away from him into the corner, intently, point blank, looking at him, but still not shouting, as if she lacked air to shout. He threw himself at her with an ax: her lips twisted so pitifully, like very young children, when they begin to be frightened of something, gaze intently at a frightening object and are about to scream. And so this unfortunate Lizaveta was simple, downtrodden and frightened once and for all that she did not even raise her hands to protect her face, although this was the most necessary natural gesture at that moment, because the ax was directly raised over her face. She only slightly raised her free left hand, far from her face, and slowly stretched it forward to him, as if pushing him away. The blow struck directly on the skull, with a point, and immediately cut through the entire upper part of the forehead, almost to the crown of the head. She collapsed. Raskolnikov was completely lost, grabbed her bundle, threw it again and ran into the hallway.","In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta, holding a large bundle; she was staring in a stupor at her murdered sister, looking white as a sheet, as if lacking the strength to scream. Seeing him come running out of the bedroom, she began trembling like a leaf, a gentle trembling, and shudders ran across her entire face; she raised one arm, was about to open her mouth, but still didn’t cry out; she began slowly backing away from him into the corner, eyes fixed on him, but still not screaming, as if she didn’t have enough breath to scream. He rushed at her with the axe; her lips became so desperately distorted, just like those of little children when they begin to feel frightened of someone, staring at the thing that frightens them, getting ready to cry. This unfortunate Lizaveta was so simple, so helpless, and so terrified once and for all, that she didn’t even raise her arms to protect her face, although that would have been the most necessary and natural gesture at that moment, because the axe was raised right above her face. She merely lifted her free left arm ever so slightly, nowhere near her face, and slowly extended it toward him, as if pushing him away. The blow struck her right on the skull, with the blade of the axe, and immediately hacked through the entire upper part of her forehead, almost to her crown. She collapsed onto the floor at once. Raskolnikov was about to panic; he grabbed her bundle, threw it down again, and ran into the entranceway.","In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta, holding a big bundle in her arms and staring in petrified horror at her dead sister. She was white as a sheet, and seemingly had no strength to cry out. When she saw him burst out of the bedroom, she began to tremble like a leaf, her body shivered and her whole face twitched. She raised an arm and opened her mouth, but no scream came out. Then she backed slowly away from him into a corner, staring him straight in the face and still not uttering a cry, as if she had no breath left to do so. He ran at her, still holding the axe; her lips worked as pitifully as a small child’s when something frightens it, and it stares fixedly at the terrifying object and is on the point of crying out. And so simple-minded was this pathetic Lizaveta, so thoroughly browbeaten and intimidated, that she didn’t even raise an arm to protect her face, though that would have been the most vital and natural gesture at that moment, with the axe raised straight above it. She barely lifted her free left arm, not bringing it up anywhere near her face, and slowly stretched it out in front of her towards him, as if to ward him off. The blow fell right on her skull, blade downwards, instantly splitting the whole of her upper forehead, almost as far back as the crown of her head. She fell like a stone. Raskolnikov completely lost his head, grabbed her bundle, threw it down again, and ran to the entrance.","In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms. She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet and seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out of the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf , a shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but still did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the corner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no sound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies’ mouths, when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them and are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so simple and had been so thoroughly scared and browbeaten that she did not even raise a hand to protect her face, though that was the most necessary and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face. She only lifted her empty left hand ever so slightly, still far from her face, slowly holding it out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the head. She collapsed at once. Raskolnikov completely lost control of himself, snatched up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entryway."
"– Зачем, зачем же нам свое упускать, когда у нас одно из главнейших средств очутилось – собственные деньги? – горячился Разумихин. – Конечно, нужно много труда, но мы будем трудиться, вы, Авдотья Романовна, я, Родион… иные издания дают теперь славный процент! А главная основа предприятия в том, что будем знать, что именно надо переводить. Будем и переводить, и издавать, и учиться, всё вместе. Теперь я могу быть полезен, потому что опыт имею. Вот уже два года скоро по издателям шныряю и всю их подноготную знаю: не святые горшки лепят, поверьте! И зачем, зачем мимо рта кусок проносить! Да я сам знаю, и в тайне храню, сочинения два-три таких, что за одну только мысль перевесть и издать их можно рублей по сту взять за каждую книгу, а за одну из них я и пятисот рублей за мысль не возьму. И что вы думаете, сообщи я кому, пожалуй, еще усумнится, такое дубье! А уж насчет собственно хлопот по делам, типографий, бумаги, продажи, это вы мне поручите! Все закоулки знаю! Помаленьку начнем, до большого дойдем, по крайней мере прокормиться чем будет, и уж по всяком случае свое вернем.","- Why, why should we lose our own when we have one of the main means - our own money? Razumikhin got excited. - Of course, a lot of work is needed, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna, I, Rodion ... other publications now give a glorious percentage! And the main basis of the enterprise is that we will know exactly what needs to be translated. We will translate, and publish, and study, all together. Now I can be useful because I have experience. For the past two years, I’ve been snooping around publishers and I know all their ins and outs: they don’t mold holy pots, believe me! And why, why carry a piece past your mouth! Yes, I myself know, and keep in secret, two or three works such that for a mere idea to translate and publish them you can take a hundred rubles for each book, but for one of them I won’t take even five hundred rubles for an idea. And what do you think, let me know who, perhaps, still doubts, such a duby! And as for the actual hassle of business, printing houses, paper, sales, you entrust me with this! I know all the nooks and crannies! Let's start small, we'll get to the big one, at least we can feed ourselves with what we have, and in any case we'll get back what's ours.","“Why, why should we allow this opportunity to get away when one of the most important resources has turned up—our own money?” said Razumikhin heatedly. “Of course, it’ll take a great deal of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna, me, Rodion. . . . Some editions now produce a handsome profit! The mainstay of our enterprise consists in our knowing precisely what to translate. We’ll translate, publish, and study, all together. I can be useful now because I have experience. For almost two years I’ve been poking around publishers, and I know all the ins and outs: it’s not as hard as it seems , believe me! Why, why should we miss this chance? I myself know, and I’ve kept it to myself, of two or three such works; the mere idea of translating and publishing them might yield one hundred rubles for each book, and for one of them I would refuse even five hundred rubles just for the idea. And what do you think, if I told someone, he might have real doubts, the blockhead! As far as the actual details, printing, paper, and sales, you can leave all that to me! I know all the ins and outs! We’ll start small, grow larger, and at least we’ll be able to feed ourselves; in any case, we’ll break even.”","‘Why ever should we miss such a chance, when we’ve suddenly got hold of one of the main necessities—our own money?’ insisted Razumikhin. ‘Of course it’ll be hard work, but we’ll work at it—you, Avdotya Romanovna, and I, and Rodion… some publications these days are amazingly profitable! And the main strength of our business will be the fact that we’ll know exactly what needs to be translated. We’ll be translating, and publishing, and learning, all at once. Right now I can be useful because I’ve had some experience. I’ve been nosing around the publishing houses for almost two years now, and I know all their ins and outs; it doesn’t take a saint to bake clay pots, believe me! Why on earth shouldn’t we leap at the chance! And then, I know of two or three works that I’m keeping quiet about; just the idea of translating and publishing them is worth a hundred roubles for each book, in fact the idea for one of them is something I wouldn’t pass on for five hundred. Just think—if I did tell anyone, they might even have second thoughts about publishing them, they’re such blockheads! As for all the business of publishing, the printers, paper, sales—leave all that to me! I know all the tricks of the trade! We’ll start off in a small way, and then grow bigger. At least we’ll have something to live on; and we’ll always get our money back.’","“Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief means of success—money of our own!” cried Razumikhin warmly. “Of course there will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotia Romanovna, I, Rodion ... You get an excellent profit on some books nowadays! And the great point of the business is that we shall know just what needs to be translated, and we shall be translating, publishing and learning all at once. I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two years I’ve been busying about among the publishers, and now I know every detail of their business. You don’t need to be a saint to make pots, believe me! And why, why should we let our chance slip! I know— and I kept the secret—two or three books which you might get a hundred rubles for, even if you just thought of translating and publishing them. I wouldn’t take five hundred even for the idea of one of them. So what do you think? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he’d hesitate—they are such blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling, you entrust that to me , I know my way about. We’ll begin in a small way and go on to a large. In any case it will get us our living and we shall get a return on our capital.”"

Но под конец многое стало удивлять его, и он, как-то поневоле, стал замечать то, чего прежде и не подозревал. Вообще же и наиболее стала удивлять его та страшная, та непроходимая пропасть, которая лежала между ним и всем этим людом. Казалось, он и они были разных наций. Он и они смотрели друг на друга недоверчиво и неприязненно. Он знал и понимал общие причины такого разъединения; но никогда не допускал он прежде, чтобы эти причины были на самом деле так глубоки и сильны. В остроге были тоже ссыльные поляки, политические преступники. Те просто считали весь этот люд за невежд и хлопов и презирали их свысока; но Раскольников не мог так смотреть: он ясно видел, что эти невежды во многом гораздо умнее этих самых поляков.

"Письмоводитель смотрел на него с снисходительною улыбкой сожаления, а вместе с тем и некоторого торжества, как на новичка, которого только что начинают обстреливать: «Что, дескать, каково ты теперь себя чувствуешь?» Но какое, какое было ему теперь дело до заемного письма, до взыскания! Стоило ли это теперь хоть какой-нибудь тревоги в свою очередь, хотя какого-нибудь даже внимания! Он стоял, читал, слушал, отвечал, сам даже спрашивал, но все это машинально. Торжество самосохранения, спасение от давившей опасности – вот что наполняло в эту минуту все его существо, без предвидения, без анализа, без будущих загадываний и отгадываний, без сомнений и без вопросов. Это была минута полной, непосредственной, чисто животной радости. Но в эту самую минуту в конторе произошло нечто вроде грома и молнии. Поручик, еще весь потрясенный непочтительностию, весь пылая и, очевидно, желая поддержать пострадавшую амбицию, набросился всеми перунами на несчастную «пышную даму», смотревшую на него с тех самых пор, как он вошел, с преглупейшею улыбкой.","The clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of regret, and at the same time a certain triumph, as at a newcomer who was just beginning to be fired upon: ""What, they say, how do you feel now?"" But what, what did he care now for the letter of loan, for the collection! Was it worth now at least some alarm in turn, even if even some attention! He stood, read, listened, answered, even asked himself, but all this is automatic. The triumph of self-preservation, salvation from the oppressive danger - that was what filled his whole being at that moment, without foresight, without analysis, without future guesses and guesses, without doubts and without questions. It was a moment of complete, immediate, purely animal joy. But at that very moment something like thunder and lightning happened in the office. The lieutenant, still shaken by the irreverence, all flushed and obviously wanting to support his suffering ambition, pounced on the unfortunate ""magnificent lady"", who had been looking at him since the moment he entered, with a stupid smile.","The head clerk regarded him with a condescending smile of pity, together with a certain exultation, as if looking at a new recruit coming under fire for the first time, as though saying, “Well, how do you feel now?” How could he possibly care about a promissory note at this time, or about some overdue payment? Was it worth even the slightest concern in its turn, even the least bit of attention? He stood there, read, listened, replied, and even asked, but he did it all automatically. The triumph of self-preservation, deliverance from threatening danger—that was what filled his entire being at this moment, without apprehension, without analysis, without future problems and solutions, without doubts and questions. It was a moment of complete, spontaneous, pure animal delight. But at this very moment there occurred something in the office akin to a thunderbolt. The lieutenant, still entirely shaken by his lack of respect, still irritated, and apparently wishing to soothe his offended vanity, began fulminating at the unfortunate “elegant lady,” who’d been staring at him with a very foolish smile since he had entered the office.","The head clerk was watching him with a smile of pitying condescension, and also a certain air of triumph, as one might watch a raw recruit coming under fire for the first time—‘Well, and how does it feel now?’ But what did he care any longer about the promissory note, or about the writ! Did all that merit the slightest anxiety, the slightest attention even? He was standing, reading, listening, answering, even asking questions of his own, but doing it all mechanically. A triumphant sense of self-preservation, of salvation from a threat hanging over him—that was what filled his whole being right now; with no thoughts of the future, no analysis, no guesses or surmises about what might happen, no doubts, no questions. It was a moment of complete, spontaneous, purely animal joy. But at that very moment something like a tempest of thunder and lightning erupted in the office. The lieutenant, still smarting from the disrespect he had endured, burning with fury and evidently intent on salvaging his injured pride, pounced savagely upon the poor ‘elegant lady’ who had been staring at him ever since he came in, with the silliest smile on her face.","The head clerk looked at him with a patronizing smile of compassion, and at the same time with a certain triumph, like he would at a novice under fire for the first time—as though he was about to say: “Well, how do you feel now?” But what did he care now for an I.O.U., for a writ of recovery! Was that worth worrying about now, was it even worth his attention! He stood, he read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but he did it all mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from overwhelming danger—that was what filled his whole soul that moment without thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions or surmises, without doubts and without questioning.

"Особенно тревожил его Свидригайлов: можно даже было сказать, что он как будто остановился на Свидригайлове. Со времени слишком грозных для него и слишком ясно высказанных слов Свидригайлова, в квартире у Сони, в минуту смерти Катерины Ивановны, как бы нарушилось обыкновенное течение его мыслей. Но, несмотря на то, что этот новый факт чрезвычайно его беспокоил, Раскольников как-то не спешил разъяснением дела. Порой, вдруг находя себя где-нибудь в отдаленной и уединенной части города, в каком-нибудь жалком трактире, одного, за столом, в размышлении, и едва помня, как он попал сюда, он вспоминал вдруг о Свидригайлове: ему вдруг слишком ясно и тревожно сознавалось, что надо бы, как можно скорее, сговориться с этим человеком и, что возможно, порешить окончательно. Один раз, зайдя куда-то за заставу, он даже вообразил себе, что ждет здесь Свидригайлова и что здесь назначено у них свидание. В другой раз он проснулся перед рассветом где-то на земле, в кустах, и почти не понимал, как забрел сюда. Впрочем, в эти два-три дня после смерти Катерины Ивановны он уже раза два встречался с Свидригайловым, всегда почти в квартире у Сони, куда он заходил как-то без цели, но всегда почти на минуту. Они перекидывались всегда короткими словами и ни разу не заговорили о капитальном пункте, как будто между ними так само собою и условилось, чтобы молчать об этом до времени. Тело Катерины Ивановны еще лежало в гробу. Свидригайлов распоряжался похоронами и хлопотал. Соня тоже была очень занята. В последнюю встречу Свидригайлов объяснил Раскольникову, что с детьми Катерины Ивановны он как-то покончил, и покончил удачно; что у него, благодаря кой-каким связям, отыскались такие лица, с помощью которых можно было поместить всех троих сирот, немедленно, в весьма приличные для них заведения; что отложенные для них деньги тоже многому помогли, так как сирот с капиталом поместить гораздо легче, чем сирот нищих. Сказал он что-то и про Соню, обещал как-нибудь зайти на днях сам к Раскольникову и упомянул, что «желал бы посоветоваться; что очень надо бы поговорить, что есть такие дела…». Разговор этот происходил в сенях, у лестницы. Свидригайлов пристально смотрел в глаза Раскольникову и вдруг, помолчав и понизив голос, спросил:","Svidrigailov was especially disturbing to him: one could even say that he seemed to have settled on Svidrigailov. From the time of Svidrigailov's words, too formidable for him and too clearly expressed, in Sonya's apartment, at the moment of Katerina Ivanovna's death, the usual course of his thoughts seemed to be disturbed. But, despite the fact that this new fact worried him extremely, Raskolnikov was somehow in no hurry to clarify the matter. Sometimes, suddenly finding himself somewhere in a remote and secluded part of the city, in some miserable tavern, alone, at a table, in thought, and barely remembering how he got here, he suddenly remembered Svidrigailov: it was suddenly too clear and it was alarmingly realized that it would be necessary, as soon as possible, to come to an agreement with this man and, possibly, to make a final decision. Once, going somewhere behind the outpost, he even imagined that he was waiting for Svidrigailov here and that they had an appointment here. Another time he woke up before dawn somewhere on the ground, in the bushes, and almost did not understand how he had wandered here. However, in those two or three days after the death of Katerina Ivanovna, he had already met Svidrigailov twice, almost always at Sonya's apartment, where he stopped by somehow without purpose, but always for almost a minute. They always exchanged short words and never once spoke of the main point, as if it had been agreed between them of itself to remain silent about it until the time was right. The body of Katerina Ivanovna was still in the coffin. Svidrigailov ordered the funeral and busied himself. Sonya was also very busy. At the last meeting, Svidrigailov explained to Raskolnikov that he somehow ended the children of Katerina Ivanovna, and ended successfully; that, thanks to some connections, such persons were found with the help of whom it was possible to place all three orphans immediately, in institutions that were very decent for them; that the money set aside for them also helped a lot, since orphans with capital are much easier to place than orphans of the poor. He also said something about Sonya, promised to visit Raskolnikov himself one of these days and mentioned that “I would like to consult; that it would be very necessary to talk, that there are such things ... "". This conversation took place in the passage, by the stairs. Svidrigailov looked intently into Raskolnikov's eyes and suddenly, after a pause and lowering his voice, he asked:","Svidrigaylov alarmed him particularly; one could even say that he seemed to be obsessed with him. From the moment of his extremely threatening and clearly articulated words in Sonya’s apartment at the time of Katerina Ivanovna’s death, it seemed that the normal course of Raskolnikov’s thoughts had been interrupted. Although this new fact upset him a great deal, he seemed in no rush to clarify the matter. At times, finding himself somewhere in a remote and isolated part of town, in some pitiful tavern, alone, at a table, deep in thought, barely recalling how he’d gotten there, all of a sudden he would remember Svidrigaylov; he’d suddenly become all too clearly and alarmingly aware that he had to come to terms with this man and, as soon as possible, had to resolve this matter with him once and for all. Once, walking somewhere outside the city, he even imagined that Svidrigaylov was waiting for him there and that they had made an appointment to meet. Another time he awoke before dawn lying somewhere on the ground, in the midst of bushes, and he could hardly recall how he had wound up there. However, in those two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna’s death, he did meet Svidrigaylov a few times, almost always at Sonya’s apartment, where he would drop by without any reason, but always stay for only a minute. They always exchanged only a few words but not once did they mention the main point, as if they had an agreement between them to keep silent about it for the time being. Katerina Ivanovna’s body was still lying there in its coffin. Svidrigaylov was busy making all the funeral arrangements. Sonya was also very preoccupied. At their last meeting, Svidrigaylov explained to Raskolnikov that he had made provisions for Katerina Ivanovna’s children and had been successful; that he had, thanks to some connections, located certain people with whose help he had been able to place all three orphans, immediately, in an extremely respectable institution; that the money he had set aside for them helped a great deal, since it was much easier to place orphans who possessed some capital than impoverished children. He also said something about Sonya, promised to stop by to see Raskolnikov shortly, and reminded him that he “wished to confer with him, that he very much wanted to talk to him, that he had certain matters . . .” This conversation took place in the hallway, near the staircase. Svidrigaylov stared into Raskolnikov’s eyes and all of a sudden, after a short pause, lowered his voice and asked:","He was particularly alarmed about Svidrigailov; one might even say he was obsessed with him. Ever since Svidrigailov had pronounced those all too ominous and explicit words in Sonia’s room, at the moment of Katerina Ivanovna’s death, the normal train of his thoughts had been disrupted. But although Raskolnikov was intensely preoccupied by this new development, he somehow seemed in no hurry to explain it. Sometimes, finding himself unexpectedly far away in a deserted part of town, sitting alone at a table in some wretched drinking den, brooding to himself and barely aware of how he had ended up there, he would suddenly think of Svidrigailov; he would become all too clearly and uneasily aware that he had to come to terms with that man, as quickly as he could, and if possible settle things once and for all. Once, he had found himself somewhere beyond the city limits and had actually been under the impression that he was expecting Svidrigailov to be there, and that they had an appointment to meet. Another time he woke before dawn to find himself lying on the ground among some bushes, with almost no idea how he had got there. He had in fact met Svidrigailov two or three times after Katerina Ivanovna’s death, generally at Sonia’s, where he had dropped in for no particular reason; but it had only been for a minute or two. They had merely exchanged a few words, never mentioning the crucial matter, as though bound by some unspoken agreement to say nothing about all that for the time being. Katerina Ivanovna’s body was still lying in its coffin. Svidrigailov was busying himself about the funeral. Sonia, too, was very busy. At their last meeting, Svidrigailov had explained to Raskolnikov that he had managed to make final arrangements for Katerina Ivanovna’s children, and very satisfactory ones. Through some of his connections, he had found certain persons with whose help all three orphans could immediately be placed in highly suitable institutions; and the money settled on them had also been very helpful, since it was much easier to place orphans who had some capital than those who were destitute. He had said something about Sonia too, promising to drop in on Raskolnikov one of these days, and mentioning that he’d ‘like to consult him, they really needed to talk, there were certain matters to discuss…’ That conversation had taken place on the landing, by the staircase. Svidrigailov had looked Raskolnikov straight in the eyes, and then, after a silence, suddenly lowered his voice to ask:","He was particularly worried about Svidrigailov, he might be said to be permanently thinking of Svidrigailov. From the time of Svidrigailov’s excessively menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia’s room at the moment of Katerina Ivanovna’s death, the normal working of his mind seemed to break down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness, Raskolnikov was in no hurry to explain it. At times, finding himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had come there, he suddenly thought of Svidrigailov. He recognized suddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an understanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking outside the city gates one day, he actually imagined that they had fixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for Svidrigailov. Another time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes and could not at first understand how he had come there. But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna’s death, he had two or three times met Svidrigailov in the building where Sonia lived, to which he had gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no reference to the vital subject, as though they had tacitly agreed not to speak of it for a period. Katerina Ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, Svidrigailov was busy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. At their last meeting Svidrigailov informed Raskolnikov that he had made an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting hold of certain people with whose help the three orphans could be at once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had given them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place orphans who have some kind of property than destitute ones. He said something too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see Raskolnikov, mentioning that “he would like to consult with him, that there were things they must talk over . . . ” This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. Svidrigailov looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause, dropping his voice, asked: “"
"– Она-то? Вообразите себе, о самых ничтожных пустяках, и подивитесь человеку: меня ведь это-то и сердит. В первый раз вошла (я, знаете, устал: похоронная служба, со святыми упокой, потом лития, закуска, – наконец-то в кабинете один остался, закурил сигару, задумался), вошла в дверь: «А вы, говорит, Аркадий Иванович, сегодня за хлопотами и забыли в столовой часы завести». А часы эти я, действительно, все семь лет, каждую неделю сам заводил, а забуду – так всегда, бывало, напомнит. На другой день я уж еду сюда. Вошел, на рассвете, на станцию, – за ночь вздремнул, изломан, глаза заспаны, – взял кофею; смотрю – Марфа Петровна вдруг садится подле меня, в руках колода карт: «Не загадать ли вам, Аркадий Иванович, на дорогу-то?» А она мастерица гадать была. Ну, и не прощу же себе, что не загадал! Убежал, испугавшись, а тут, правда, и колокольчик. Сижу сегодня после дряннейшего обеда из кухмистерской, с тяжелым желудком – сижу, курю – вдруг опять Марфа Петровна, входит вся разодетая, в новом шелковом зеленом платье с длиннейшим хвостом: «Здравствуйте, Аркадий Иванович! Как на ваш вкус мое платье? Аниська так не сошьет». (Аниська – это мастерица у нас в деревне, из прежних крепостных, в ученье в Москве была – хорошенькая девчонка.) Стоит, вертится передо мной. Я осмотрел платье, потом внимательно ей в лицо посмотрел: «Охота вам, говорю, Марфа Петровна, из таких пустяков ко мне ходить, беспокоиться». – «Ах, бог мой, батюшка, уж и потревожить тебя нельзя!» Я ей говорю, чтобы подразнить ее: «Я, Марфа Петровна, жениться хочу». – «От вас это станется, Аркадий Иванович; не много чести вам, что вы, не успев жену схоронить, тотчас и жениться поехали. И хоть бы выбрали-то хорошо, а то ведь, я знаю, – ни ей, ни себе, только добрых людей насмешите». Взяла да и вышла, и хвостом точно как будто шумит. Экой ведь вздор, а?","- Is she? Imagine to yourself, about the most insignificant trifles, and marvel at the man: after all, this is what makes me angry. For the first time she came in (you know, I was tired: the funeral service, rest in peace with the saints, then lithium, an appetizer - finally, she was left alone in the office, lit a cigar, thought), went in the door: “And you, he says, Arkady Ivanovich , today for troubles and forgot to start the clock in the dining room. And I, indeed, for all seven years, started this watch myself every week, but if I forget it, it always happened, it reminds me. The next day I'm on my way here. He entered the station at dawn, - he took a nap during the night, he was broken, his eyes were sleepy, - he took coffee; I look - Marfa Petrovna suddenly sits down beside me, in the hands of a deck of cards: ""Won't you guess, Arkady Ivanovich, on the road?"" And she was a master of guessing. Well, I won’t forgive myself for not guessing! He ran away, frightened, and here, however, the bell. I am sitting today after a wretched dinner from the kitchen master, with a heavy stomach - I am sitting, smoking - suddenly again Marfa Petrovna, all dressed up, in a new green silk dress with a long tail, comes in: “Hello, Arkady Ivanovich! How do you like my dress? Aniska won’t sew like that.” (Aniska is a craftswoman in our village, from the former serfs, she was an apprentice in Moscow - a pretty girl.) She stands, spins in front of me. I examined the dress, then carefully looked into her face: ""Hunting for you, I say, Marfa Petrovna, from such trifles to go to me, to worry."" - “Oh, my God, father, it’s impossible to disturb you!” I tell her to tease her: ""I, Marfa Petrovna, want to get married."" - “It will come from you, Arkady Ivanovich; it is not much honor to you that, without having time to bury your wife, you immediately went to get married. And at least they chose well, otherwise, I know, neither for her, nor for yourself, just make good people laugh. She took it and left, and her tail seemed to make noise. What nonsense, right?","“She? Just imagine, she talks about the most trivial things; you have to marvel at her: that’s just what makes me so angry. The first time she came (you know, I was tired: the funeral service, the hymns, then the litany, and the meal—at last I remained alone in my study; I lit up a cigar and was lost in thought), she entered in through the door. ‘ And you,’ she says, ‘Arkady Ivanovich, in the midst of all your bustle today, you forgot to wind the clock in the dining room.’ As a matter of fact, all seven years I myself used to wind the clock once a week, and if I forgot—she’d always remind me. The next day I was already on my way here. I arrived at the station at daybreak—I’d dozed off during the night, exhausted, barely able to keep my eyes open—to get some coffee ; I look—and Marfa Petrovna suddenly sits down next to me, holding a deck of cards. ‘Shall I tell your fortune for the trip with these cards, Arkady Ivanovich?’ She was a master at fortune-telling. I won’t ever forgive myself for not letting her do it! Frightened, I ran away, and just then I heard the bell announce the train. Today I was sitting with a full stomach after a terrible dinner from an eating house—I was sitting there and smoking—all of a sudden Marfa Petrovna shows up again, all dressed up, in her new green silk dress with a very long train. ‘How do you do, Arkady Ivanovich! How do you like my dress? Aniska doesn’t make them like this.’ (Aniska’s the seamstress in the country, a former serf, who learned to sew in Moscow—she’s a pretty girl.) She stood there and turned around in front of me. I examined the dress, then looked carefully into her face: ‘Why, Marfa Petrovna, do you come to see me and trouble me with such trivial matters?’ ‘Ah, good Lord, my dear, it’s impossible to trouble you with anything!’ I say to tease her: ‘Marfa Petrovna, I want to get married.’ ‘ That’s just like you, Arkady Ivanovich; it’s not very honorable: you’ve hardly managed to bury your wife, and you want to go off and get married. If you could only choose well, but I know that nothing will come of it either for her or for you, and you’ll only make good people laugh.’ She said this and then up and left; her train seemed to rustle as she went out. What nonsense, isn’t it?”","‘She? Just imagine, she talks of the most trivial stuff. You wouldn’t believe it—it always makes me cross. The first time she came in (I was tired, you know: that funeral service, and “rest in peace with the Saints”, and then the prayers, and the meal—at last I was alone in my study, and I lit a cigar and started thinking). She came into the room, saying “Arkady Ivanovich, with all that going on, you’ve forgotten to wind the dining-room clock”. And true enough, all those seven years I’d wound that clock myself, every week, and if I forgot she’d always remind me. Next day I was on my way here. And at dawn I got out at a station— I’d dozed off in the night and now I ached all over, my eyes wouldn’t open—and I got myself some coffee. I looked up, and suddenly there was Marfa Petrovna sitting down beside me holding a pack of cards. “Wouldn’t you like me to tell your fortune for the road, Arkady Ivanovich?” Now she was an expert fortune teller. And I’ll never forgive myself for not letting her do it! I took fright and ran off; actually the station bell went at the same time. And now today, I’d just eaten a perfectly foul dinner from the cookshop, and I was sitting there smoking and feeling bloated, when suddenly Marfa Petrovna walks in again, all dressed up in a new green silk dress with a long train. “Good afternoon, Arkady Ivanovich! How do you like my dress? Aniska couldn’t make one like this.” (Aniska is a seamstress in our village, a former serf who went to Moscow to learn her trade; a fine young girl.) So she stands in front of me and turns this way and that. I had a look at the dress, and then looked her straight in the face. “What’s come over you, Marfa Petrovna, going to all the trouble of coming to see me about such nonsense?”—“Oh, good Lord, man, I’m not even allowed to bother you now!” To needle her, I told her: “Marfa Petrovna, I want to get married.” “That’s just like you, Arkady Ivanovich; and it doesn’t do you much credit, going off to get married when you’ve scarcely buried your wife. And if only you’d even chosen properly—but I know you, it won’t do either her or you any good, all you’ll do is make yourself a laughing stock for honest folk.” And she turned and walked out, and her train seemed to rustle over the floor. What nonsense, eh?’","“She! Would you believe it , she talks of the silliest trifles and—man is a strange creature—it makes me angry. The first time she came in (I was tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch afterwards. At last I was left alone in my study. I lit a cigar and began to think), she came in at the door. ‘You’ve been so busy today, Arkady Ivanovich, you’ve forgotten to wind the dining room clock,’ she said. All those seven years I’ve wound that clock every week, and if I forgot it she would always remind me. The next day I set off on my way here. I got out at the station at daybreak; I’d been asleep, tired out, with my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up and there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of cards in her hands. ‘Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady Ivanovich?’ She was a great one for telling fortunes. I shall never forgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a fright, and, besides, the bell rang. I was sitting today, feeling very heavy after a miserable dinner from a café; I was sitting smoking, and all of a sudden Marfa Petrovna appeared again. She came in very smart in a new green silk dress with a long train. ‘ Hello, Arkady Ivanovich! How do you like my dress? Aniska couldn’t make one like this.’ (Aniska was a dressmaker in the country, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a pretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress, and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. ‘I’m surprised you bother to come to me about such unimportant matters, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘Good gracious, you won’t let anyone disturb you about anything!’ To tease her I said, ‘I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘That’s just like you, Arkady Ivanovich; it does you very little credit to come looking for a bride when you’ve hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a good choice, at least, but I know it won’t be for your happiness or hers, you will only be a laughing-stock to all good people.’ Then she went out and her train seemed to rustle. Isn’t it nonsense?”"
"– Да помилуйте, капитан, – начал он весьма развязно, обращаясь вдруг к Никодиму Фомичу, – вникните и в мое положение… Я готов даже просить у них извинения, если в чем с своей стороны манкировал. Я бедный и больной студент, удрученный (он так и сказал: «удрученный») бедностью.

I’m a former student because I can no longer support myself, but I’ll be receiving some money soon. . . . I have a mother and a sister in a certain province. They’ll send me some money, and then I’ll . . . I’ll pay up.

Now she’s demanding payment according to this acknowledgment of debt: judge for yourself!”","‘Excuse me, Captain,’ he began very nonchalantly, turning suddenly to Nikodim Fomich, ‘but try to put yourself in my place… I’m happy to apologize if I’ve done anything wrong. I’m a poor, sick student, crushed’ (that was the word he used—‘crushed’) ‘by poverty. An ex-student, because at the moment I’m unable to maintain myself, but I shall be getting some money… I have a mother and sister in —— Province,* they’ll send me some, and I’ll… pay. My landlady’s a kind woman, but she was so furious when I lost the lessons I was giving and couldn’t pay her for over three months that she won’t even send me up my meals now… And I haven’t the slightest idea what this bill is! Here she is demanding money against this promissory note, but how on earth can I pay her, I ask you?’","“Excuse me, Captain,” he began easily, suddenly addressing Nikodim Fomich, “look at it from my point of view . . . I apologize if I have been badly behaved. I am a poor student, sick and shattered” (“shattered” was the word he used) “by poverty. I am not studying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money . . . I have a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to me, and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so angry at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the last four months, that she does not even send up my dinner . . . and I don’t understand this I.O.U. at all. She is asking me to pay her what is on this I.O.U. How can I pay her? Judge for yourselves! . . . ”"

"– Насчет Роди вы оба можете ошибаться, – подхватила несколько пикированная[37] Пульхерия Александровна. – Я не про теперешнее говорю, Дунечка. То, что пишет Петр Петрович в этом письме… и что мы предполагали с тобой, – может быть, неправда, но вы вообразить не можете, Дмитрий Прокофьич, как он фантастичен и, как бы это сказать, капризен. Его характеру я никогда не могла довериться, даже когда ему было только пятнадцать лет. Я уверена, что он и теперь вдруг что-нибудь может сделать с собой такое, чего ни один человек никогда и не подумает сделать… Да недалеко ходить: известно ли вам, как он, полтора года назад, меня изумил, потряс и чуть совсем не уморил, когда вздумал было жениться на этой, как ее, – на дочери этой Зарницыной, хозяйки его?","“You can both be wrong about Rodya,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna, somewhat dived, picked up. “I’m not talking about the present, Dunechka. What Pyotr Petrovich writes in this letter ... and what we assumed with you may not be true, but you cannot imagine, Dmitri Prokofich, how fantastic and, how shall I put it, capricious. I could never trust his character, even when he was only fifteen years old. I am sure that even now he can suddenly do something with himself that no one would ever think of doing ... Yes, not far to go: do you know how he, a year and a half ago, amazed me, shocked me and almost completely died when he thought of marrying this one, like her, the daughter of this Zarnitsyna, his mistress?","“You both may be mistaken about Rodya,” Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna declared, somewhat offended. “I’m not talking about the present, Dunechka.

"Он стоял среди комнаты и в мучительном недоумении осматривался кругом; подошел к двери, отворил, прислушался; но это было не то. Вдруг, как бы вспомнив, бросился он к углу, где в обоях была дыра, начал все осматривать, запустил в дыру руку, пошарил, но и это не то. Он пошел к печке, отворил ее и начал шарить в золе: кусочки бахромы от панталон и лоскутья разорванного кармана так и валялись, как он их тогда бросил, стало быть никто не смотрел! Тут вспомнил он про носок, про который Разумихин сейчас рассказывал. Правда, вот он на диване лежит, под одеялом, но уж до того затерся и загрязнился с тех пор, что уж, конечно, Заметов ничего не мог рассмотреть.","He stood in the middle of the room and looked around in painful bewilderment; went to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not it. Suddenly, as if remembering, he rushed to the corner where there was a hole in the wallpaper, began to examine everything, put his hand into the hole, fumbled, but that was not it either. He went to the stove, opened it and began to rummage through the ashes: pieces of fringe from his trousers and rags of a torn pocket were lying around as he threw them then, so no one was looking! Then he remembered about the sock, which Razumikhin was just talking about. True, here he is lying on the sofa, under the covers, but he has become so worn out and dirty since then that, of course, Zametov could not see anything.","He stood in the middle of his room and looked around in tormented bewilderment.

He went to the stove, opened it, and began searching in the cinders: pieces of the trouser fringes and fragments of his torn pockets were lying inside, just as they had been when he’d thrown them in there: this meant that no one had looked inside!

"Переведя дух и прижав рукой стукавшее сердце, тут же нащупав и оправив еще раз топор, он стал осторожно и тихо подниматься на лестницу, поминутно прислушиваясь. Но и лестница на ту пору стояла совсем пустая; все двери были заперты; никого-то не встретилось. Во втором этаже одна пустая квартира была, правда, растворена настежь, и в ней работали маляры, но те и не поглядели. Он постоял, подумал и пошел дальше. «Конечно, было бы лучше, если б их здесь совсем не было, но… над ними еще два этажа».","Taking a breath and pressing his pounding heart with his hand, immediately groping and adjusting the ax again, he began carefully and quietly ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the staircase at that time was completely empty; all doors were locked; no one met. On the second floor, one empty apartment was, however, wide open, and painters were working in it, but they did not even look. He stood, thought, and walked on. ""Of course, it would be better if they weren't here at all, but ... there are two more floors above them.""","Catching his breath and pressing his hand against his pounding heart, feeling and adjusting the axe again, he began climbing the stairs cautiously and quietly, constantly listening for any sounds.

However, on the second floor, the door to one empty apartment stood wide open and painters were working inside it, but they didn’t even notice him.

He felt for the axe and adjusted it in its loop, and then started climbing the stairs, cautiously and silently, listening at every step.

True, there was an empty flat on the second floor, and its door was wide open, with painters working inside, but they didn’t even spare him a glance.

"– А я так уверена, что он и завтра будет то же говорить… об этом, – отрезала Авдотья Романовна и уж, конечно, это была загвоздка, потому что тут был пункт, о котором Пульхерия Александровна слишком боялась теперь заговаривать. Дуня подошла и поцеловала мать. Та крепко молча обняла ее. Затем села в тревожном ожидании возвращения Разумихина и робко стала следить за дочерью, которая, скрестив руки, и тоже в ожидании, стала ходить взад и вперед по комнате, раздумывая про себя. Такая ходьба из угла в угол, в раздумье, была обыкновенною привычкою Авдотьи Романовны, и мать всегда как-то боялась нарушать в такое время ее задумчивость.","“And I’m so sure that he will say the same thing tomorrow ... about this,” Avdotya Romanovna snapped, and, of course, it was a snag, because there was a point about which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was now too afraid to speak. Dunya came up and kissed her mother. She hugged her tightly. Then she sat down in anxious expectation of Razumikhin's return and timidly began to watch her daughter, who, with her arms folded and also in anticipation, began to walk up and down the room, thinking to herself. Such walking from corner to corner, in thought, was Avdotya Romanovna's usual habit, and her mother was always somehow afraid to disturb her reverie at such a time.","“But I’m certain he’ll say the same thing tomorrow . . . on this subject,” Avdotya Romanovna said, cutting her short. That, of course, was the catch, because it was the very point Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna was now too afraid to mention. Dunya went up to her mother and kissed her. The latter embraced her warmly in silence. Then Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna sat down in nervous anticipation of Razumikhin’s return and timidly began to follow her daughter, who, folding her arms, also in anticipation, began pacing the room, deep in thought. Such pacing from corner to corner in deep thought was Avdotya Romanovna’s usual habit, and her mother always feared interrupting her reflections at such times.","‘I’m sure he’ll think better of it tomorrow,’ she added, probing still further. ‘Well I’m certain he’ll say the same thing tomorrow… about that,’ said Avdotya Romanovna, cutting her short; and of course that was the end of the matter, because this was a point that Pulkheria Alexandrovna was too frightened to speak of. Dunia went up to her mother and kissed her, and her mother silently gave her a hug. Then she sat down, full of anxiety, to await Razumikhin’s return, and timidly watched her daughter who was now walking up and down the room with folded arms, thinking to herself, as she too waited. Avdotya Romanovna often had this habit of pacing the room from end to end, pondering deeply, and at such times her mother was always scared of breaking her train of thought.","“And I am sure that he will say the same tomorrow . . . about that,” Avdotia Romanovna said finally. And, of course, there was no going beyond that , for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was afraid to discuss. Dunia went up and kissed her mother. The latter warmly embraced her without speaking. Then she sat down to wait anxiously for Razumikhin’s return, timidly watching her daughter who walked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought. This walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotia Romanovna’s and the mother was always afraid to break in on her daughter ’s mood at such moments."

"– Нет, не от меня! Но я знал, что он к вам пошел и зачем пошел, – резко ответил Раскольников.","- No, not from me! But I knew that he went to you and why he went, - Raskolnikov answered sharply.","“No, I didn’t send him! But I knew he came to see you, and I know why he came,” Raskolnikov replied sharply.","‘No, it wasn’t! But I knew he’d gone to see you, and why he went,’ replied Raskolnikov brusquely.","“No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,” Raskolnikov answered sharply."
"– Убирайся же к черту! – сказал он тихо и почти задумчиво. – Стой! – заревел он внезапно, когда Раскольников тронулся было с места, – слушай меня. Объявляю тебе, что все вы, до единого, – болтунишки и фанфаронишки! Заведется у вас страданьице – вы с ним как курица с яйцом носитесь! Даже и тут воруете чужих авторов. Ни признака жизни в вас самостоятельной! Из спермацетной мази вы сделаны, а вместо крови сыворотка! Никому-то из вас я не верю! Первое дело у вас, во всех обстоятельствах – как бы на человека не походить! Сто-о-ой! – крикнул он с удвоенным бешенством, заметив, что Раскольников опять трогается уходить, – слушай до конца! Ты знаешь, у меня сегодня собираются на новоселье, может быть, уж и пришли теперь, да я там дядю оставил, – забегал сейчас, – принимать приходящих. Так вот если бы ты не был дурак, не пошлый дурак, не набитый дурак, не перевод с иностранного… видишь, Родя, я сознаюсь, ты малый умный, но ты дурак! – так вот, если б ты не был дурак, ты бы лучше ко мне зашел сегодня, вечерок посидеть, чем даром-то сапоги топтать. Уж вышел, так уже нечего делать! Я б тебе кресла такие мягкие подкатил, у хозяев есть… Чаишко, компания… А нет, – так и на кушетке уложу, – все-таки между нами полежишь… И Зосимов будет. Зайдешь, что ли?","- Get the hell out of here! he said softly and almost thoughtfully. - Stop! - he suddenly roared, when Raskolnikov was about to start, - listen to me. I declare to you that all of you, to the last, are chatterers and fanfare! Suffering will start in you - you run around with him like a chicken with an egg! Even here you steal other people's authors. Not a sign of independent life in you! You are made of spermaceti ointment, and instead of blood, serum! I don't trust any of you! The first thing you have, in all circumstances - how would you not look like a person! Hundred-oh-oh! he shouted with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again starting to leave, “listen to the end! You know, today they are going to my housewarming party, maybe they have already come now, but I left my uncle there, - I ran in just now, - to receive those who come. So, if you weren't a fool, not a vulgar fool, not a stuffed fool, not a translation from a foreign language... you see, Rodya, I confess, you're a smart little fellow, but you're a fool! - so, if you weren't a fool, you'd better come to me today, to sit in the evening, than trample on your boots for nothing. Already out, there's nothing left to do! I would have rolled up such soft chairs for you, the owners have ... A teacup, a company ... But no, I’ll put it on the couch - after all, you’ll lie down between us ... And Zossimov will be. Are you coming in, right?","“Go to hell!” he said softly, almost thoughtfully. “Wait!” he roared suddenly when Raskolnikov was about to stir from where he stood. “Listen to me. I declare that all of you, to the last one, are blabberers and braggarts! As soon as you come up against some pathetic bit of suffering, you fuss over it like a hen with her egg! Even then you steal from other writers. There’s not a trace of independent life in you! You’re made from waxy spermaceti whale oil, and you have watery whey in your veins instead of blood! I don’t trust any of you! The first thing you do in any circumstance is try not to resemble a human being! Wait!” he cried with redoubled fury, having noticed that Raskolnikov was about to take his leave again. “Hear me out to the end! You know that people are coming to my housewarming today; perhaps they’ve gathered already. I left my uncle there to receive the guests—and stopped in here just now. So, if you were not such a fool, not such a vulgar fool, an absolute fool, a translation from the original . . . you see, Rodya, I admit, you’re clever, but you’re still a fool! Well, if you were not such a fool, you’d be better off coming by my place today to spend the evening there than wearing out your new boots for nothing here. Since you’re out, why not? I’d borrow a nice, soft armchair for you; my landlord has one. . . . You’d have some tea, some company. . . . Or else, you could lie down on the couch—you’d still be among us. . . . And Zosimov will be there. Perhaps you’ll change your mind and come?”","‘Well then, go to hell!’ he said quietly, almost meditatively. ‘Wait!’ he suddenly roared when Raskolnikov was about to walk away. ‘ Listen to me. Let me tell you this: you’re all, every last one of you, windbags and show-offs! The moment you find something to suffer about, you fuss over it like a hen with her egg! And even then you’re poaching from other authors. You haven’t a trace of independent life in you. You’re all made of whale oil, with whey instead of blood! I don’t trust a single one of you! All you care about, wherever you are, is making sure you don’t look like human beings! Sto-o-op!’ he cried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was once more trying to leave. ‘ Wait till I’ve finished! You know I’ve got a house-warming party today, there may be people there already, I left my uncle at home to let them in, I just dropped by there a minute ago. So now, if you weren’t an idiot, a stupid idiot, a senseless idiot, a translation from some foreign language—you see, Rodia, you’re a clever lad, I grant you, but you’re an idiot!—so there you are, if you weren’t an idiot you’d do better to come round to my place and spend the evening with us, instead of wearing your shoe leather out to no purpose. After all, you’ve come out anyway, so what would it matter? I’d draw up such a nice soft armchair for you, the landlady has one… A glass of tea, a bit of company… Or if you don’t want that, you could lie down on my couch—you’d still be there amongst us… And Zosimov will be there too. So you’ll come, won’t you?’","“Well, go to hell then,” he said gently and thoughtfully. “Stay here,” he roared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. “Listen to me. Let me tell you, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots! If you’ve got any little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you are plagiarists even in that! There isn’t a sign of independent life in you! You’re made of spermaceti ointment and you’ve got lymph in your veins instead of blood. I don’t trust any of you! When anything happens the first thing all of you do is fail to behave like human beings! Stop!” he cried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making a movement, “hear me out! You know I’m having a house-warming this evening , I dare say they’ve arrived by now, but I left my uncle there— I just ran in—to receive the guests. And if you weren’t a fool, a common fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation . . . you see, Rodia, I recognize you’re a clever fellow, but you’re a fool! And if you weren’t a fool you’d come round to me this evening instead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you’ve gone out, there’s no help for it! I’d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady has one . . . a cup of tea, company . . . Or you could lie on the sofa—in any case, you would be with us . . . Zossimov will be there too.

"Кох остался, пошевелил еще раз тихонько звонком, и тот звякнул один удар; потом тихо, как бы размышляя и осматривая, стал шевелить ручку двери, притягивая и опуская ее, чтоб убедиться еще раз, что она на одном запоре.

"– Бедность не порок, дружище, ну да уж что! Известно, порох, не мог обиды перенести. Вы чем-нибудь, верно, против него обиделись и сами не удержались, – продолжал Никодим Фомич, любезно обращаясь к Раскольникову, – но это вы напрасно: на-и-бла-га-а-ар-р-род-нейший, я вам скажу, человек, но порох, порох!

"Он, однако ж, не то чтоб уж был совсем в беспамятстве во все время болезни: это было лихорадочное состояние, с бредом и полусознанием. Многое он потом припомнил. То казалось ему, что около него собирается много народу и хотят его взять и куда-то вынести, очень об нем спорят и ссорятся. То вдруг он один в комнате, все ушли и боятся его, и только изредка чуть-чуть отворяют дверь посмотреть на него, грозят ему, сговариваются об чем-то промеж себя, смеются и дразнят его. Настасью он часто помнил подле себя; различал и еще одного человека, очень будто бы ему знакомого, но кого именно – никак не мог догадаться и тосковал об этом, даже и плакал. Иной раз казалось ему, что он уже с месяц лежит; в другой раз – что все тот же день идет. Но об том – об том он совершенно забыл; зато ежеминутно помнил, что об чем-то забыл, чего нельзя забывать, – терзался, мучился, припоминая, стонал, впадал в бешенство или в ужасный, невыносимый страх. Тогда он порывался с места, хотел бежать, но всегда кто-нибудь его останавливал силой, и он опять впадал в бессилие и беспамятство. Наконец, он совсем пришел в себя.","He, however, not that he was completely unconscious during the entire illness: it was a feverish state, with delirium and semi-consciousness. Later he recalled a lot. It seemed to him that a lot of people were gathering around him and they wanted to take him and take him somewhere, they were arguing and quarreling about him very much. Then suddenly he is alone in the room, everyone is gone and is afraid of him, and only from time to time they open the door a little to look at him, threaten him, agree on something between themselves, laugh and tease him. He often remembered Nastasya by his side; he could also distinguish another person, who seemed to be very familiar to him, but who exactly - he could not guess at all and longed for it, even cried. At times it seemed to him that he had been lying for a month; another time - that all the same day goes by. But about that - about that he had completely forgotten; but every minute he remembered that he had forgotten about something, which must not be forgotten - he was tormented, tormented, remembering, moaning, falling into a rage or into a terrible, unbearable fear. Then he was trying to get off the spot, he wanted to run, but someone always stopped him by force, and he again fell into powerlessness and unconsciousness. Finally, he completely came to his senses.","However, Raskolnikov was not completely unconscious throughout his illness; he had a feverish condition with periods of delirium and semiconsciousness. He remembered a great deal afterward. First, there seemed to be many people surrounding him, wanting to pick him up and carry him somewhere; they stood over him, arguing and quarreling. Then he was suddenly all alone in his room; everyone had left and they were all afraid of him; from time to time, they merely opened his door slightly to have a look at him, threaten him, confer about something or other among themselves, or laugh and tease him. He recalled that Nastasya was often at his side; he distinguished one other person, someone very familiar, but who that was precisely—he was unable to discern; he was sad about that and even wept. Sometimes it seemed that he’d been lying there for about a month; another time, that it was still the same day he had fallen ill. But about that—he had completely forgotten about that; on the other hand, he constantly recalled that he had forgotten about something that he should not have forgotten about—he suffered and agonized, trying to remember; he moaned, fell into a rage or into horrible, unbearable fear. Then he would try to hoist himself up, wanting to run away, but someone always restrained him forcibly, and he would sink into weakness and unconsciousness. At last he recovered consciousness completely.","But in fact he wasn’t completely unconscious throughout his illness. He was running a high fever, half-comatose and delirious; but later on he remembered a great deal. Sometimes it seemed to him that crowds of people had gathered round him and wanted to seize him and carry him off somewhere; they argued and quarrelled about him a lot. Or else he would suddenly find himself alone in his room, and everyone else was scared of him and had gone away, but just occasionally they would open the door a crack and look at him, threatening him and hatching plots about him, and laughing and mocking at him. He often remembered seeing Nastasia nearby. And he could make out another person, someone whom he seemed to know very well—but quite who it was, he could never work out, and this upset him and even reduced him to tears. Sometimes he imagined he had been lying here for a whole month; at other times, it was all on a single day. But that—that was something he had completely forgotten; though he constantly kept remembering that he had forgotten something which he mustn’t forget. He racked his brains and tormented himself trying to remember it, and groaned and got into rages or fell into horrible, unbearable terrors. Then he would drag himself out of bed and try to run away, but there was always someone stopping him by force, and then he would fall helplessly unconscious again. Eventually he came to himself again.","HE WAS NOT COMPLETELY unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.

He remembered Nastasia often at his bedside; he distinguished another person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could not remember who they were, and this upset him, even made him cry. Sometimes he imagined he had been lying there a month; at other times it all seemed part of the same day. But of that—of that he had no recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten something he ought to remember.

"Оказалось, что в эту минуту Порфирий Петрович был у себя в кабинете один. Кабинет его была комната ни большая, ни маленькая; стояли в ней: большой письменный стол перед диваном, обитым клеенкой, бюро, шкаф в углу и несколько стульев – всё казенной мебели, из желтого отполированного дерева. В углу, в задней стене, или, лучше сказать, в перегородке, была запертая дверь: там, далее, за перегородкой, должны были, стало быть, находиться еще какие-то комнаты. При входе Раскольникова Порфирий Петрович тотчас же притворил дверь, в которую тот вошел, и они остались наедине. Он встретил своего гостя, по-видимому, с самым веселым и приветливым видом, и только уже несколько минут спустя Раскольников, по некоторым признакам, заметил в нем как бы замешательство, – точно его вдруг сбили с толку или застали на чем-нибудь очень уединенном и скрытном.","It turned out that at that moment Porfiry Petrovich was alone in his office. His study was a room neither large nor small; stood in it: a large writing-table in front of a sofa upholstered in oilcloth, a bureau, a cupboard in the corner, and a few chairs—all state-owned furniture, of polished yellow wood. In the corner, in the back wall, or, to put it better, in the partition, there was a locked door: there, further, behind the partition, there must have been some other rooms. At the entrance of Raskolnikov, Porfiry Petrovich immediately closed the door through which he entered, and they were left alone. He greeted his guest, apparently with the most cheerful and affable air, and only a few minutes later Raskolnikov, according to some signs, noticed in him a kind of confusion - as if he had suddenly been confused or caught on something very secluded. and secretive.","It turned out that this time Porfiry Petrovich was alone. His office was neither large nor small; a large desk stood in front of a sofa covered with an oilcloth; there was also a bureau, a bookcase in one corner, and several chairs—all official furniture, made of polished yellow wood. In one corner, in the rear wall—or, that is, the partition—there was a closed door: farther on, behind the partition, must have therefore been some other rooms. At Raskolnikov’s entrance, Porfiry Petrovich quickly and quietly closed the door through which he had entered, so that they remained alone. He met his guest, apparently, with the most cheerful and welcoming look; it was only a few minutes later that Raskolnikov, by certain indications, noticed his embarrassment, as if he was suddenly unsettled or had been discovered doing something very private and secret. “Ah, my dear fellow!","Porfiry Petrovich turned out to be alone in his office.

In the corner of the far wall, or rather partition, was a closed door; so presumably there must be other rooms beyond it. When Raskolnikov came in, Porfiry Petrovich at once shut the door behind him, and they were on their own. He welcomed his visitor with a seemingly genial and hospitable air, and it was not until a few minutes later that Raskolnikov noticed some signs that suggested he was rather flustered—as if he had suddenly been taken by surprise or caught out in some very secret and private activity.","He found Porfiry Petrovich alone in his study.

He met his visitor with an apparently genial and good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had been thrown off guard or caught in the middle of something very secret. “Ah, my friend!"
"– Что ты? – закричал он, осматривая с ног до головы вошедшего товарища; затем помолчал и присвистнул.","- What you? He shouted, examining the comrade who had entered from head to toe; then he paused and whistled.","“What’s the matter with you?” he cried, examining his friend from head to foot; then he fell silent and whistled shrilly.","‘What’s up?’ he cried out, looking his friend up and down. Then he stopped and gave a whistle.","“Is it you?” he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a brief pause, he whistled."
"День опять был ясный и теплый. Ранним утром, часов в шесть, он отправился на работу, на берег реки, где в сарае устроена была обжигательная печь для алебастра и где толкли его. Отправилось туда всего три работника. Один из арестантов взял конвойного и пошел с ним в крепость за каким-то инструментом; другой стал изготовлять дрова и накладывать в печь. Раскольников вышел из сарая на самый берег, сел на складенные у сарая бревна и стал глядеть на широкую и пустынную реку. С высокого берега открывалась широкая окрестность. С дальнего другого берега чуть слышно доносилась песня. Там, в облитой солнцем необозримой степи, чуть приметными точками чернелись кочевые юрты. Там была свобода и жили другие люди, совсем непохожие на здешних, там как бы самое время остановилось, точно не прошли еще века Авраама и стад его. Раскольников сидел, смотрел неподвижно, не отрываясь; мысль его переходила в грезы, в созерцание; он ни о чем не думал, но какая-то тоска волновала его и мучила.","The day was clear and warm again. Early in the morning, at about six o'clock, he went to work, on the river bank, where a kiln for alabaster was set up in a barn and where they pushed it. Only three workers went there. One of the prisoners took the escort and went with him to the fortress for some kind of instrument; the other began to make firewood and put it into the oven. Raskolnikov went out of the barn to the very bank, sat down on the logs piled up by the barn and began to look at the wide and deserted river. From the high bank opened wide surroundings. From the far other shore, a song was barely audible. There, in the boundless steppe drenched in the sun, nomadic yurts were blackened as barely perceptible dots. There was freedom and other people lived there, completely different from those here, it was as if time itself had stopped there, as if the centuries of Abraham and his flocks had not yet passed. Raskolnikov sat, staring motionless, not looking up; his thought passed into daydreams, into contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a kind of melancholy agitated and tormented him.","The day was once again clear and warm. Early in the morning, around six o’clock, he set off for work on the banks of the river, where a kiln for baking had been set up in a shed and where the alabaster was crushed. Only three men were sent to work there. One of the convicts, accompanied by a guard, went off to the fortress to fetch a certain tool; another began to split firewood and load the kiln. Raskolnikov walked out of the shed and over to the riverbank, sat down on a pile of logs nearby, and began gazing out at the wide, empty river. A broad landscape opened up from the high bank. From the distant opposite bank he could hear the sound of singing. There, in the immense steppe, flooded with sunlight, dark tents of some nomads were barely visible. Over there was freedom; over there lived other people, not at all like the ones on this side of the river; it was as if time had stood still there, as if the age of Abraham and his flocks had not yet passed. Raskolnikov sat there, watching without moving, and couldn’t tear himself away; his thoughts wandered into daydreams, into contemplation; he wasn’t thinking about anything, but some longing troubled and tormented him.","It was another fine, warm day. Early in the morning, about six o’clock, he went out to work on the riverbank, where there was a shed with a kiln for heating the alabaster they beat there. Just three workers had been sent to work there. One of the convicts had gone back to the fortress with the guard to fetch some tool; the second one set about chopping wood and putting it into the kiln. Raskolnikov went out of the shed onto the riverbank, sat down on the pile of logs beside the shed, and gazed at the wide, desolate river. The bank was high, with a distant view all round. Far away on the opposite bank, he could just make out the sound of singing. There, on the wide stretches of the steppe, bathed in sunlight, the nomads’ yurts showed as barely visible dots. There was freedom out there, and different people, nothing like the people back here; out there, time seemed to have stopped, as if the age of Abraham and his flocks had never passed away. Raskolnikov sat without moving and looked out without shifting his gaze; his thoughts turned into daydreams and reflections; he wasn’t thinking of anything particular, but his mind was troubled and distressed.","Again it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six o’clock, he went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster and had a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only three of them who were sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and laying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the wide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before him, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank. In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black specks, the nomads’ tents. There there was freedom, there other men were living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand still, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed. Raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into daydreams, into contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him."

Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace spread out around her chair like a balloon and filled almost half the room. There was a strong odor of perfume. The lady was obviously embarrassed that she was occupying so much space and giving off the scent of her perfume, although she smiled in a way that combined both cowardice and impudence, but with evident discomfort.","‘Ich danke,’ she replied, quietly taking a seat with a rustling of silks. Her pale blue dress with its white lace border ballooned out from the chair, occupying almost half the room. There was a sudden waft of perfume. But the lady seemed embarrassed at taking up half the room and smelling so strongly of perfume; and though her smile was at once timid and impudent, she was clearly uneasy.","“Ich danke,”17 said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She smelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness."

Они же вам понадобятся, потому, Софья Семеновна, так жить, по-прежнему, – скверно, да и нужды вам более нет никакой.","“I, Sofya Semyonovna, maybe I’ll leave for America,” said Svidrigailov, “and since we are seeing you, probably for the last time, I have come to give some orders. Well, have you seen this lady today? I know what she told you, there is nothing to retell. (Sonya made a movement and blushed.) This people has a well-known fold. As for the sisters and your brother, they really are attached, and the money due to them was issued by me for each, against receipts, where it should be, in faithful hands. You, however, take these receipts for yourself, just in case. Here, take it! Well, now it's over. Here are three five-percent tickets, only three thousand. You take this for yourself, in fact, for yourself, and let it be so between us and so that no one will know, no matter what you hear there. You will need them, because, Sofya Semyonovna, it’s bad to live like that, as before, and you don’t need any more.","“Sofiya Semyonovna,” he said, “I may be going away to America, and therefore we’re most likely seeing each other for the last time, so I’ve come to make some arrangements. Well, did you see that lady today? I know what she said to you, so there’s no need to retell it.” (Sonya was about to make some movement and began blushing.) “These people have a certain way of thinking. As far as your sisters and your brother are concerned, they really are provided for, and I have transferred the money due for each of them into reliable hands and have receipts for it. Here, take them. Well, now that’s done. Here are three five percent notes, worth three thousand rubles in all. Take this for yourself, strictly for yourself, and let this remain between the two of us, so that no one else knows, no matter what you hear later. You’ll have need for them because, Sofiya Semyonovna, to live as you were before is unseemly; now you’ll have no need to do so.”","‘Sofia Semionovna, I may be going to America,’ said Svidrigailov, ‘and since this is probably the last time we’ll see each other, I’ve come to make some arrangements. Well now, did you see that lady today? I know what she’ll have told you, there’s no need to repeat it to me.’ (Sonia had blushed and made a slight movement.) ‘Those people have their own way of doing things. As for your sisters and your brother, they really will be looked after, and I’ve paid over the money meant for each one of them to the appropriate trustworthy people, and been given a receipt. Actually, you might as well have those receipts yourself, just in case. Here they are, take them! So now that’s all settled. Here are three five-per-cent bonds, amounting to three thousand roubles altogether. They’re for you, for your own; take them, and let that be between ourselves; nobody else needs to know about it, whatever you may hear people say. You’ll need the money, Sofia Semionovna, because it’s not right to live the way you did before, and you’ve no need to do it any more.’","“I may be going to America, Sofia Semionovna,” said Svidrigailov,” and as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some arrangements. Well, did you see the lady today? I know what she said to you, you need not tell me.” (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) “Those people have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them I’ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take them! Well, now that’s settled. Here are three 5 per cent bonds to the value of three thousand rubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no-one knows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, because to go on living in the old way, Sofia Semionovna, is bad, and besides there is no need for it now.”"

What stupid people they are! Oh, Lord! You’re stupid, stupid,” she shouted, turning to face everyone. “You still don’t know, you don’t know, what sort of girl she is, what a heart she has! Steal it?

What stupid people they are! Oh Lord! You’re all stupid, stupid!’ she cried, addressing everyone present. ‘You don’t know anything, you don’t know what a heart she has, what sort of a girl she is!

"– А, вы про это! – засмеялся Свидригайлов, – да, я бы удивился, если бы, после всего, вы пропустили это без замечания. Ха! ха! Я хоть нечто и понял из того, что вы тогда… там… накуролесили и Софье Семеновне сами рассказывали, но, однако, что ж это такое? Я, может, совсем отсталый человек и ничего уж понимать не могу. Объясните, ради бога, голубчик! Просветите новейшими началами.","- Oh, you mean it! - Svidrigailov laughed, - yes, I would be surprised if, after all, you missed this without comment. Ha! Ha! At least I understood something from what you then ... there ... played tricks on and told Sofya Semyonovna yourself, but, however, what is it? Maybe I'm a completely backward person and I can't understand anything. Explain, for God's sake, my dear!

Ha-ha! I managed to understand a little bit of what you were saying then . . . there . . . to Sofiya Semyonovna, the tricks you were playing. But what’s all that about? Perhaps I’m old-fashioned and unable to understand a thing. Explain it, for heaven’s sake, my dear fellow! Enlighten me with the latest principles.”","‘Oh, so that’s what you’re after!’ laughed Svidrigailov. ‘ Yes, I’d have been surprised if you hadn’t mentioned that, after all that’s happened. Ha! ha! I could actually make out a bit of what you’d been getting up to… and were telling Sofia Semionovna about—but what does it all add up to anyway? I may be quite out of date, and quite incapable of understanding anything. Do explain it to me, my dear fellow, for goodness’ sake! Bring me up to date with modern thinking.’","“Ah, that’s it, is it?” laughed Svidrigailov. “Yes, I would have been surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened. Ha-ha!

"За дверью справа, за тою самою дверью, которая отделяла квартиру Сони от квартиры Гертруды Карловны Ресслих, была комната промежуточная, давно уже пустая, принадлежавшая к квартире г-жи Ресслих и отдававшаяся от нее внаем, о чем и выставлены были ярлычки на воротах и наклеены бумажечки на стеклах окон, выходивших на канаву. Соня издавна привыкла считать эту комнату необитаемою. А между тем, все это время, у двери в пустой комнате простоял господин Свидригайлов и, притаившись, подслушивал. Когда Раскольников вышел, он постоял, подумал, сходил на цыпочках в свою комнату, смежную с пустою комнатой, достал стул и неслышно перенес его к самым дверям, ведущим в комнату Сони. Разговор показался ему занимательным и знаменательным и очень, очень понравился, – до того понравился, что он и стул перенес, чтобы на будущее время, хоть завтра например, не подвергаться опять неприятности простоять целый час на ногах, а устроиться покомфортнее, чтоб уж во всех отношениях получить полное удовольствие.","Behind the door on the right, behind the same door that separated Sonya's apartment from Gertrud Karlovna Resslich's apartment, there was an intermediate room, long since empty, which belonged to Madame Resslich's apartment and was rented out from her, about which labels were put up on the gates and pasted pieces of paper on the panes of the windows overlooking the ditch. Sonya has long been accustomed to consider this room uninhabited. And meanwhile, all this time, Mr. Svidrigailov stood at the door in an empty room and, hiding, eavesdropped. When Raskolnikov left, he stood for a moment, thought, went on tiptoe to his room, adjacent to the empty room, took out a chair and inaudibly carried it to the very doors leading to Sonya's room. The conversation seemed entertaining and significant to him, and he liked it very, very much - he liked it so much that he moved the chair so that for the future tense, even tomorrow, for example, he would not again be subjected to the trouble of standing for an hour on his feet, but settle down more comfortably, so that in all relationship to enjoy.","Behind the door on the right, the door that separated Sonya’s apartment from Gertruda Karlovna Resslikh’s, there was an intervening room, long since empty, belonging to Madame Resslikh’s apartment, and rented out by her; notices to that effect had been placed on gates and announcements stuck to windows overlooking the canal. For a long time, Sonya had grown accustomed to thinking the room was uninhabited. Meanwhile, all this time, Mr. Svidrigaylov had been standing hidden behind the door in the empty room, and eavesdropping. When Raskolnikov left, he stood there, thought for a while, returned on tiptoe to his own room, which was next to the empty room, got a chair, and silently brought it up to the door leading into Sonya’s room. The conversation struck him as interesting and significant, and he’d enjoyed it very, very much—so much so that he had brought a chair in order that in the future, even tomorrow, for example, he wouldn’t have to subject himself again to the unpleasantness of standing on his feet for a whole hour, but he could make himself more comfortable, so that he could derive pure enjoyment in all regards. * A yurodivy, or holy fool, was a saintly person or ascetic in the early Christian tradition; later, in common usage, the term came to mean a crazy person or a simpleton. † Sonya reads from and recites verses from the Gospel of John 11:1–45.","Behind the door on the right, the one that separated Sonia’s lodging from Gertruda Karlovna Resslich’s flat, there was another room, which had long stood empty. It was part of Madame Resslich’s flat, and was to let; there were little fliers to that effect on the gates, and notices stuck to the windowpanes looking out onto the canal. Sonia had long believed the room to be unoccupied. But all through this latest encounter, Mr Svidrigailov had been hiding in the empty room, standing by the door and eavesdropping. When Raskolnikov came out, he stood and thought for a little, then tiptoed back to his own room, next door to the empty one, got a chair and silently brought it right up against the door to Sonia’s room. He had found the conversation fascinating and important, and had very much enjoyed it—so much so that he had brought over his chair, so that on the next occasion—perhaps tomorrow—he shouldn’t be subjected to the unpleasant experience of standing on his feet for an hour on end, but could listen in greater comfort, thus obtaining complete satisfaction in every way.","kissing her feet, weeping. On the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia’s room from Madame Resslich’s apartment, was a room which long stood empty. A card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertising it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the room being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidrigailov had been standing, listening at the door of the empty room. When Raskolnikov went out he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the door that led to Sonia’s room. The conversation had struck him as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it—so much so that he brought a chair that he might not in the future, tomorrow, for instance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but would be able listen in comfort."

"– А вы всё об этом, об этих проклятых «потребностях»! – вскричал он с ненавистью, – тьфу, как я злюсь и досадую, что, излагая систему, упомянул вам тогда преждевременно об этих проклятых потребностях! Черт возьми! Это камень преткновения для всех вам подобных, а пуще всего – поднимают на зубок, прежде чем узнают, в чем дело! И точно ведь правы! Точно ведь гордятся чем-то! Тьфу! Я несколько раз утверждал, что весь этот вопрос возможно излагать новичкам не иначе как в самом конце, когда уж он убежден в системе, когда уже развит и направлен человек. Да и что, скажите, пожалуйста, что вы находите такого постыдного и презренного хоть бы в помойных ямах? Я первый, я готов вычистить какие хотите помойные ямы! Тут даже нет никакого самопожертвования! Тут просто работа, благородная, полезная обществу деятельность, которая стоит всякой другой и уже гораздо выше, например, деятельности какого-нибудь Рафаэля или Пушкина, потому что полезнее!","- And you're all about this, about these damned ""needs""! he exclaimed with hatred; Damn it! This is a stumbling block for all your kind, and most of all - they pick it up by the tooth before they know what it is! And you are definitely right! Surely they are proud of something! Ugh! I have stated several times that it is possible to present this whole question to beginners only at the very end, when he is already convinced of the system, when the person is already developed and directed. And what, please tell me, what do you find so shameful and contemptible, even in the garbage pits? I'm the first, I'm ready to clean up any garbage pits you want! There is not even any self-sacrifice! It's just work, a noble activity useful to society, which is worth any other and already much higher, for example, the activities of some Raphael or Pushkin, because it is more useful!","“You go on about the same thing, these damned ‘necessities’!” he cried with hatred. “Bah! I’m so angry and annoyed that in explaining the system I mentioned to you prematurely these natural necessities! Damn it all! It’s a stumbling block for anyone like you, and worst of all—you ridicule it before finding out what it’s all about! As if they were right! As if they had something to be proud of! Bah! I’ve insisted several times that this question can be explained to novices only at the very end, when a person’s already committed to the system, when he’s educated and politically progressive. Please tell me what you find so embarrassing and contemptible, even in cesspools? I myself would be the first to clean out any cesspools you like! There’s no kind of self-sacrifice involved! It’s simply work, a noble, useful activity to society, one worth as much as any other, and is a much higher activity, for example, than that of some Raphael or Pushkin, because it’s more useful!”¶","‘You keep going on and on about the same thing, these damned demands of nature!’ he cried in a voice full of hatred. ‘Ugh, I’m so furious and cross with myself for ever mentioning those wretched demands of nature to you, before I had to, when I was explaining the system to you! Damn it all! People like you invariably trip up over that, and the worst thing is that you all start making jokes about it before you understand any of it. And you think you’ve got it right! And you seem to be proud of yourselves! Phoo! I’ve often insisted that you can only explain that whole question to a novice at the very end, when he’s already convinced of the system, when he’s been educated and steered in the right direction. And anyway—what, would you kindly tell me, do you find so shameful and despicable in a cesspit, even? I myself would be the first to volunteer to clean out any cesspit you like! And there’s no self-sacrifice to it either! It’s just work, an honourable, socially beneficial activity, worthy of any other; and far superior, of course, to the doings of any Raphael or Pushkin, because it’s more useful!’ *","“You are always thinking of something unpleasant,” he cried with aversion. “Pah! How irritated I am that when I was expounding our system, I referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy! It’s always a stumbling-block to people like you, they ridicule it before they understand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Pah! I’ve often maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice until he has firm faith in the system. And tell me, please, what do you find so shameful even about cesspools? I would be the first to be ready to clean out any cesspool you like. And it’s not a question of self-sacrifice , it’s simply work, honorable, useful work which is as good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a Pushkin, because it is more useful.”"
"– Добивай! – кричит Миколка и вскакивает, словно себя не помня, с телеги. Несколько парней, тоже красных и пьяных, схватывают что попало – кнуты, палки, оглоблю – и бегут к издыхающей кобыленке.

"– После скажу, какая макушка, а теперь, мой милейший, объявляю вам… нет, лучше: «сознаюсь»… Нет, и это не то: «показание даю, а вы снимаете» – вот как!

Заметов смотрел на него прямо в упор, не шевелясь и не отодвигая своего лица от его лица. Страннее всего показалось потом Заметову, что ровно целую минуту длилось у них молчание и ровно целую минуту они так друг на друга глядели.","“Afterward I’ll tell you what a crown, and now, my dear, I announce to you ... no, it’s better: “I confess” ...

Zametov looked at him straight at point-blank range, without moving or moving his face away from his. What struck Zametov afterwards as strange of all was that their silence lasted for exactly a full minute, and for exactly a full minute they looked at each other like that.","“I’ll explain that to you later; but now, my dear fellow, I declare . . . no, even better, ‘I confess. . . .’ No, that’s not right either: ‘I’m making a statement, and you take it down,’ ” that’s what!

Zametov stared directly at him without stirring, not moving his face away from Raskolnikov’s. Later it seemed to Zametov that the strangest thing about that moment was that their silence lasted a full minute, and for that minute they stared directly at each other.","And meanwhile, my dear friend, I’ll announce to you… no, I mean I’ll “confess”… No, that ’s not right either. “I’ll make a statement, and you take it down” , that’s what!

Zametov was staring straight back at him, without moving or drawing back. The strangest thing of all, Zametov thought later on, was that this silence lasted a full minute, and for the whole of that minute they went on staring at one another.","“I’ll explain that afterwards, but now, my friend, I declare to you ... no, better ‘I confess’ . . . No, that’s not right either; ‘I make a deposition and you take it.’ I depose that I was reading, that I was looking and searching . . . ” he screwed up his eyes and paused. “I was searching—and came here on purpose to do it—for news of the murder of the old pawnbroker woman,” he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing his face extremely close to Zametov’s. Zametov looked at him steadily, without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametov afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for exactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while."

Dunya cried, turned pale as death and rushed to a corner, where she quickly shielded herself with a table that happened to be at hand. She didn't scream; but she glared at her tormentor and vigilantly followed his every movement. Svidrigailov also did not move from his place and stood opposite her at the other end of the room. He even mastered himself, at least from the outside. But his face was still pale. The mocking smile never left him.","“Ah! So you’re going to use force, are you?” cried Dunya; she turned deathly pale and rushed to the corner of the room, where she quickly shielded herself with the little table that was there. She wasn’t shouting; but she stared at her tormentor and followed his every move carefully. Svidrigaylov didn’t budge from his place, either, and stood facing her at the other end of the room. He even managed to gain control of himself, at least outwardly. But his face was as pale as before. A mocking smile still played on his lips.","‘Aha! So this is a rape!’ cried Dunia, pale as death. She ran over to the corner and quickly barricaded herself in with a little table that happened to be there. She didn’t scream, but fixed her eyes on her tormentor and intently followed his every movement. Svidrigailov, too, made no move, but stood facing her at the opposite end of the room. He had actually taken himself in hand, at least outwardly. But his face was as pale as ever, and he still wore his mocking smile.","“This is an outrage,” cried Dunia, turning pale as death. She rushed to the furthest corner, where she hurriedly barricaded herself with a little table. She did not scream, but fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched every movement he made. Svidrigailov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her. He really was composed, at least in appearance, but his face was pale as before. The mocking smile did not leave his face."

Шаги стихли.","“Damn it! ..” he shouted suddenly and impatiently, leaving his guard, he went downstairs too, hurrying and knocking on the stairs with his boots. The footsteps died away.","“Damn it all!” he cried suddenly and impatiently; abandoning his lookout; he, too, headed down, hastening, his boots pounding on the stairs. His footsteps receded.","‘Blast it all!’ he burst out impatiently, abandoned his vigil, and hurried off downstairs, his boots clattering down the steps. The sound of his footsteps died away.","“What the hell?” he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping his heavy boots on the stairs.

After all, they will hear, they will come! Well then, we will tell them, think! whispered Porfiry Petrovich in horror, bringing his face close to Raskolnikov's.","“Quiet down, old boy!

А разузнамши вчера, сегодня пошел. Впервой пришел – его не было. Часом помедля пришел – не приняли, в третий пришел – допустили. Стал я ему докладывать все, как было, и стал он по комнате сигать и себя в грудь кулаком бил: «Что вы, говорит, со мной, разбойники, делаете? Знал бы я этакое дело, я б его с конвоем потребовал!» Потом выбежал, какого-то позвал и стал с ним в углу говорить, а потом опять ко мне и стал спрашивать и ругать. И много попрекал; а донес я ему обо всем и говорил, что с моих вчерашних слов ничего вы не посмели мне отвечать и что вы меня не признали. И стал он тут опять бегать, и все бил себя в грудь, и серчал, и бегал, а как об вас доложили, – ну, говорит, полезай за перегородку, сиди пока, не шевелись, что бы ты ни услышал, и стул мне туда сам принес и меня запер; может, говорит, я тебя и спрошу.

"Мелькала постоянно во все эти дни у Раскольникова еще одна мысль и страшно его беспокоила, хотя он даже старался прогонять ее от себя, так она была тяжела для него! Он думал иногда: Свидригайлов все вертелся около него, да и теперь вертится; Свидригайлов узнал его тайну; Свидригайлов имел замыслы против Дуни. А если и теперь имеет? Почти наверное можно сказать, что да. А если теперь, узнав его тайну и таким образом получив над ним власть, он захочет употребить ее как оружие против Дуни?","Raskolnikov constantly flashed through all these days another thought and worried him terribly, although he even tried to drive it away from him, it was so hard for him! He sometimes thought: Svidrigailov kept spinning around him, and now he spins; Svidrigailov learned his secret; Svidrigailov had plans against Dunya. What if he still has it? You can almost certainly say yes. And if now, having learned his secret and thus having gained power over him, he wants to use it as a weapon against Dunya?","During all these days, another thought had kept constantly running through Raskolnikov’s head and upsetting him terribly, although he’d tried to drive it away because he found it so painful! He sometimes thought: Svidrigaylov was constantly skulking around him and was doing so now ; Svidrigaylov knew his secret; he had harbored designs against Dunya. What if he still did now? One could say yes, he did, almost for certain. And what if now, knowing his secret and having thus acquired power over him, Svidrigaylov wanted to use that power as a weapon against Dunya?","There was another thought that kept running through Raskolnikov’s mind, and worried him dreadfully, although he did his best to shut it out because it was so unbearable. He found himself thinking that Svidrigailov had always hung around him, and was still doing so. Svidrigailov had found out his secret; Svidrigailov had had his eye on Dunia. Supposing he still did? Almost certainly the answer was yes. So what if, now that he’d found out Raskolnikov’s secret and got him in his power, he decided to use his power as a weapon against Dunia?","There was another thought which had been continually hovering around Raskolnikov’s mind recently, and which was causing him great uneasiness. It was so painful that he made evident efforts to get rid of it. He sometimes thought that Svidrigailov was shadowing him. Svidrigailov had found out his secret and had had intentions towards Dunia. What if he had them still? Wasn’t it practically certain that he had? And what if, having learnt his secret and gained power over him, he were to use it as a weapon against Dunia?"
"– Не там смотрите… в четвертом Евангелии… – сурово прошептала она, не подвигаясь к нему.","“Look in the wrong place… in the fourth Gospel…” she whispered sternly, not moving towards him.","It’s in the Fourth Gospel,” she whispered sternly, not approaching him.","‘You’re looking in the wrong place… it’s in the fourth Gospel…’ she whispered sternly, without moving towards him.","It’s in the fourth gospel,” she whispered sternly, without looking at him."

I never turn here or go in. I turn right with the Hay. And the road to you is not here. Just turned around, and here you are! This is strange!","“I was going to your apartment to look for you,” began Raskolnikov, “but why did I suddenly turn into Obukhovsky Prospect from the Haymarket?

"Он тотчас же распорядился, налил, потом налил еще другую чашку, бросил свой завтрак и пересел опять на диван. По прежнему обхватил он левою рукой голову больного, приподнял его и начал поить с чайной ложечки чаем, опять беспрерывно и особенно усердно подувая на ложку, как будто в этом процессе подувания и состоял самый главный и спасительный пункт выздоровления. Раскольников молчал и не сопротивлялся, несмотря на то, что чувствовал в себе весьма достаточно сил приподняться и усидеть на диване безо всякой посторонней помощи, и не только владеть руками настолько, чтобы удержать ложку или чашку, но даже, может быть, и ходить. Но по какой-то странной, чуть не звериной хитрости ему вдруг пришло в голову скрыть до времени свои силы, притаиться, прикинуться, если надо, даже еще не совсем понимающим, а между тем выслушать и выведать, что такое тут происходит? Впрочем, он не совладал с своим отвращением: схлебнув ложек десять чаю, он вдруг высвободил свою голову, капризно оттолкнул ложку и повалился опять на подушку. Под головами его действительно лежали теперь настоящие подушки – пуховые и с чистыми наволочками; он это тоже заметил и взял в соображение.","He immediately gave orders, poured it, then poured another cup, threw down his breakfast and sat down again on the sofa. As before, he clasped the patient's head with his left hand, lifted it and began to drink tea from a teaspoon, again continuously and especially diligently blowing on the spoon, as if this process of blowing was the most important and saving point of recovery. Raskolnikov was silent and did not resist, despite the fact that he felt quite enough strength in himself to get up and sit on the sofa without any outside help, and not only to control his hands enough to hold a spoon or a cup, but even, perhaps, to walk. But by some strange, almost bestial trick, it suddenly occurred to him to hide his powers for the time being, to hide, to pretend, if necessary, even not quite understanding yet, and meanwhile to listen and find out what is happening here? However, he could not cope with his disgust: having sipped ten teaspoons of tea, he suddenly freed his head, capriciously pushed the spoon away and fell back onto the pillow. There were real pillows under his head now — down and with clean pillowcases; he noticed this too and took it into consideration.","He took charge immediately, poured her tea, then poured another cup, forsook his own lunch, and sat down on the sofa again. As before, he put his left arm around the patient’s head, raised him up, and began to feed him teaspoons of tea, once again constantly and very diligently blowing on the spoon to cool the tea, as if the primary and most salutary point of the healing process consisted in this act of cooling. Raskolnikov kept silent and didn’t resist, even though he felt he had sufficient strength to raise himself up and sit on the sofa without anyone’s assistance. He felt that he could also control his own hands, hold a spoon or a cup, and perhaps even walk on his own. But with some strange, almost animal cunning, it suddenly occurred to him to hide his strength for the time being, to conceal himself, if necessary, to pretend that he didn’t understand everything completely. Meanwhile he would listen and try to determine what was happening. He was unable to master his revulsion, however: after swallowing down a dozen or so spoons of tea, he suddenly freed his head, stubbornly pushed the spoon away, and threw himself back on the pillow again. Under his head now were some genuine pillows—down pillows with clean pillowcases; he noticed that, too, and took it into consideration.","He took charge straight away, poured out a cup and then a second one, left his meal and moved back to the divan. Once again he put his left arm round his patient’s head, raised him up and started feeding him teaspoons of tea, again blowing constantly and very assiduously on it, as if this act of blowing represented the most important and life-saving part of the whole healing process. Raskolnikov said nothing and put up no resistance, although he felt quite strong enough to raise himself and sit up on the divan without anyone’s help; and not only felt capable of controlling his hands sufficiently to hold a spoon or a cup—he thought he might even manage to walk. But a strange sort of almost animal cunning suddenly prompted him to hide his strength for the time being; to lie low, and if necessary even pretend that he wasn’t quite in his right mind; and meanwhile to listen and work out what was going on here. But he couldn’t control his revulsion: after swallowing a dozen spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly shook his head free, capriciously pushed the spoon away and collapsed back onto the pillow. He actually had proper pillows under his head now, down pillows with clean pillowslips; he saw that too, and took note of it.","He poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. As before, he put his left arm round the sick man’s head, raised him up and gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective means towards his friend’s recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made no resistance, though he felt strong enough to sit up on the sofa without support and could not only have held a cup or a spoon, but maybe even walked about. But in a moment of some strange, almost animal cunning he dreamt up the idea of hiding his strength and lying low for a time, pretending if necessary that he was not yet in full possession of his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on. Yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away capriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed that, too, and took note of it."

"– Пашенькой зовет! Ах ты рожа хитростная! – проговорила ему вслед Настасья; затем отворила дверь и стала подслушивать, но не вытерпела и сама побежала вниз.

Oh, you cunning mug! - said Nastasya after him; then she opened the door and began to eavesdrop, but could not bear it and ran downstairs herself. She was very much interested to know what he was talking about there with the hostess; and in general it was clear that she was completely enchanted by Razumikhin.","“He calls her Pashenka! Oh, you sly dog, you!” Nastasya said as he was leaving; then she opened the door and began listening, but couldn’t refrain from running downstairs. She very much wanted to find out what he was talking about with the landlady because she was completely enamored with Razumikhin.","‘Pashenka, he calls her! Cheeky so-and-so! You…’ Nastasia called out after him; then she opened the door and listened, but she couldn’t contain her curiosity and ran downstairs herself. She was desperate to find out what he was talking about with the landlady down there; besides, it was clear that she was quite enchanted by Razumikhin.","“He calls her Pashenka! Ah, he’s a clever one!” said Nastasia as he went out; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist running downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he would say to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumikhin."
"– Да ведь этак вы себя, пожалуй, кому-нибудь бить позволите, господин Разумихин, из удовольствия благодетельствовать.","“Why, you’d probably allow someone to beat you like that, Mr. Razumikhin, out of the pleasure of doing good.”",". .” “It seems you’ll let anyone beat you up, Mr. Razumikhin, just for the enjoyment of being nice to him.”","‘If you go on like this, you’ll be letting people beat you up, Mr Razumikhin, just for the pleasure of doing them a good turn.’","“Razumikhin, you’d let anybody beat you from sheer benevolence.”"

"Он бросился к двери, прислушался, схватил шляпу и стал сходить вниз свои тринадцать ступеней, осторожно, неслышно, как кошка. Предстояло самое важное дело – украсть из кухни топор. О том, что дело надо сделать топором, решено им было уже давно. У него был еще складной садовый ножик; но на нож, и особенно на свои силы, он не надеялся, а потому и остановился на топоре окончательно. Заметим кстати одну особенность по поводу всех окончательных решений, уже принятых им в этом деле. Они имели одно странное свойство: чем окончательнее они становились, тем безобразнее, нелепее тотчас же становились и в его глазах. Несмотря на всю мучительную внутреннюю борьбу свою, он никогда, ни на одно мгновение не мог уверовать в исполнимость своих замыслов, во все это время.","He rushed to the door, listened, grabbed his hat and began to descend his thirteen steps, carefully, inaudibly, like a cat.

He also had a folding garden knife; but he did not rely on the knife, and especially on his own strength, and therefore finally settled on the ax. Let us note by the way one peculiarity about all the final decisions that he has already taken in this matter. They had one strange property: the more finally they became, the uglier, more absurd they immediately became in his eyes. Despite all his painful inner struggle, he never, not for a single moment, could believe in the feasibility of his plans, during all this time.","He rushed to the door, listened cautiously, grabbed his hat, and started down the thirteen steps, carefully, inaudibly, like a cat.

I saw him myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he is just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and is standing still, pretending to roll a cigarette . . . Think—how can we keep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?”"

"– Замечать стал еще прежде, окончательно же убедился третьего дня, почти в самую минуту приезда в Петербург. Впрочем, еще в Москве воображал, что еду добиваться руки Авдотьи Романовны и соперничать с господином Лужиным.","- I began to notice even earlier, but I was finally convinced on the third day, almost at the very moment of my arrival in Petersburg. However, even in Moscow I imagined that I was going to seek the hand of Avdotya Romanovna and compete with Mr. Luzhin.","“I began noticing it even before; I was convinced of it for sure two days ago, almost at the very moment when I arrived in Petersburg. Besides, while still in Moscow I imagined that I was coming here to seek Avdotya Romanovna’s hand and become Mr. Luzhin’s rival.”","‘I began to see it some time ago, but I was finally convinced of it the day before yesterday, almost as soon as I arrived in Petersburg.

"Приговор, однако ж, оказался милостивее, чем можно было ожидать, судя по совершенному преступлению, и, может быть, именно потому, что преступник не только не хотел оправдываться, но даже как бы изъявлял желание сам еще более обвинить себя. Все странные и особенные обстоятельства дела были приняты во внимание. Болезненное и бедственное состояние преступника до совершения преступления не подвергалось ни малейшему сомнению. То, что он не воспользовался ограбленным, зачтено частию за действие пробудившегося раскаяния, частию за несовершенно здравое состояние умственных способностей во время совершения преступления. Обстоятельство нечаянного убийства Лизаветы даже послужило примером, подкрепляющим последнее предположение: человек совершает два убийства и в то же время забывает, что дверь стоит отпертая! Наконец, явка с повинною, в то самое время, когда дело необыкновенно запуталось вследствие ложного показания на себя упавшего духом изувера (Николая) и, кроме того, когда на настоящего преступника не только ясных улик, но даже и подозрений почти не имелось (Порфирий Петрович вполне сдержал слово), все это окончательно способствовало смягчению участи обвиненного.","The verdict, however, turned out to be more merciful than could be expected, judging by the crime committed, and, perhaps, precisely because the criminal not only did not want to justify himself, but even, as it were, expressed a desire to accuse himself even more. All the strange and special circumstances of the case were taken into account. The morbid and disastrous state of the offender before the commission of the crime was not subjected to the slightest doubt. The fact that he did not take advantage of the robbed is credited partly for the action of awakened repentance, partly for the imperfectly healthy state of mental faculties at the time of the crime. The circumstance of the accidental murder of Lizaveta even served as an example to reinforce the latter assumption: a person commits two murders and at the same time forgets that the door is unlocked! Finally, the confession, at the very time when the case was unusually confused due to the false testimony of a fanatic (Nikolai) who had fallen in spirit, and, moreover, when there was almost no clear evidence, but even suspicion, of the real criminal (Porfiry Petrovich completely kept his word), all this ultimately contributed to mitigating the fate of the accused.","The sentence, however, turned out to be more lenient than could have been expected, judging by the nature of the crime, and perhaps precisely because the criminal not only didn’t try to justify himself, but even seemed to manifest a desire to incriminate himself further. All of the strange and peculiar circumstances of the affair were taken into account. That the criminal had endured a morbid and impoverished condition before committing the crime did not arouse the slightest doubt. The fact that he hadn’t made use of the stolen property was considered partly an indication of his awakened remorse, and partly a result of the flawed condition of his mental faculties at the time of the commission of the crime. The circumstance of the accidental killing of Lizaveta even served as an example supporting that latter assumption: a man commits two murders yet at the same time forgets that the door to the apartment is wide open! Finally, his appearance with a confession, at the very moment when the affair was becoming extraordinarily tangled as a result of the false testimony of the dejected fanatic (Nikolai) and, besides that, when there were no clear clues pointing to the real criminal, or even any suspicions (Porfiry Petrovich kept his word completely), all of this definitely facilitated the mitigation of the defendant’s fate.","The sentence, however, turned out more lenient than might have been expected from the nature of the crime; perhaps this was precisely because the criminal not only made no attempt to justify himself, but in fact seemed to want to incriminate himself still further. All the strange and special features of the affair were taken into account. There wasn’t the faintest doubt that before he committed the crime, the accused had been in a sick and impoverished condition. The fact that he hadn’t made use of the stolen property was credited partly to the effects of his awakening repentance and partly to his impaired mental state at the time the crime was committed. The unplanned killing of Lizaveta in fact served as an example in support of the latter idea: here’s a man who commits two murders and yet at the same time forgets that the door is unlocked! And finally, his voluntary confession, at a time when the affair had become extraordinarily confused on account of the false confession made by the melancholic and fanatical Nikolay, and when there was not only no clear evidence against the true culprit, but not even any real suspicion of him (Porfiry Petrovich had faithfully kept his word)—everything ultimately combined to soften the defendant’s sentence.","The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected, perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself, but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration. There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his abnormal mental state at the time of the crime. Incidentally, the murder of Lizaveta served in fact to confirm the last hypothesis: a man commits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally, the confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by Nikolai through melancholy and fanaticism, and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovich fully kept his word)—all this did much to soften the sentence."

"Ни одного мига нельзя было терять более. Он вынул топор совсем, взмахнул его обеими руками, едва себя чувствуя, и почти без усилия, почти машинально, опустил на голову обухом.

He took out the ax completely, swung it with both hands, barely feeling himself, and almost without effort, almost mechanically, lowered it on his head with the butt. It was as if his strength was not here. But as soon as he lowered the ax, then power was born in him.","There was not a moment to spare. He withdrew the axe completely, raised it with both his arms, hardly aware of himself, and almost with no effort, almost mechanically, brought the butt end down onto her head. It was as if he had no strength. But as soon as he let the axe fall once, he felt a new strength in himself.","There was not a moment to be lost.

"– Я бы не так сделал, – начал он издалека. – Я бы вот как стал менять: пересчитал бы первую тысячу, этак раза четыре со всех концов, в каждую бумажку всматриваясь, и принялся бы за другую тысячу; начал бы ее считать, досчитал бы до средины, да и вынул бы какую-нибудь пятидесятирублевую, да на свет, да переворотил бы ее и опять на свет – не фальшивая ли? «Я, дескать, боюсь: у меня родственница одна двадцать пять рублей таким образом намедни потеряла»; и историю бы тут рассказал. А как стал бы третью тысячу считать – нет, позвольте: я, кажется, там, во второй тысяче, седьмую сотню неверно сосчитал, сомнение берет, да бросил бы третью, да опять за вторую, – да этак бы все-то пять… А как кончил бы, из пятой да из второй вынул бы по кредитке, да опять на свет, да опять сомнительно, «перемените, пожалуйста», – да до седьмого поту конторщика бы довел, так что он меня как и с рук-то сбыть уж не знал бы! Кончил бы все наконец, пошел, двери бы отворил – да нет, извините, опять воротился, спросить о чем-нибудь, объяснение какое-нибудь получить, – вот я бы как сделал!","""I wouldn't do that,"" he began from a distance. - Here's how I would begin to change: I would count the first thousand, that way four times from all over, peering into each piece of paper, and would start with another thousand; I would start counting it, I would count it to the middle, and I would take out some fifty-ruble note, but into the light, but I would turn it over and again into the light - isn’t it fake? “I, they say, am afraid: I have a relative who lost twenty-five rubles in this way the other day”; and tell the story here. And how would I begin to count the third thousand - no, excuse me: it seems that there, in the second thousand, I incorrectly counted the seventh hundred, doubt takes it, but I would throw the third, but again for the second - yes, that would be all five ... And how I would have finished, from the fifth and from the second I would have taken out a credit card, but again into the world, but again it is doubtful, “change it, please,” - and I would have brought the clerk to the seventh sweat, so that he would sell me out of hand would not know! If I could finish everything at last, go, open the door - no, excuse me, come back again, ask about something, get some explanation - that's how I would do it!","“I wouldn’t have done it like that,” he began in a roundabout way. “Here’s how I would have changed the counterfeit banknotes: I’d have counted the first thousand very carefully, four times over, examining each note, and then moved on to the next thousand; I’d have begun counting that one, reached the middle of the pile, and then pulled out some fifty-ruble note, held it up to the light, turned it over, and held that side up to the light, too—checking to see if it was counterfeit. ‘I’m afraid,’ I would say. ‘Several days ago, a relative of mine lost twenty-five rubles.’ And I would have told him the whole story. And when I started counting the third thousand—‘No, wait , I think I miscounted the seventh hundred in the second thousand.’ I’d be overcome by doubt; then I’d put down the third thousand, return to the second, and so on for all five. As soon as I’d finished, I’d pull one banknote out of the fifth thousand and one out of the second, hold them up to the light again, and I would say, looking very doubtful, ‘Please exchange these,’ and thus I would drive the clerk to utter exasperation, so that he’d be looking for a way to get rid of me! I’d finish all my business, start to leave, open the door—but no, excuse me, I’d go back again, ask about something else, and listen to his explanation— that’s how I’d do it!”","‘I wouldn’t do it like that,’ he began in a faraway voice. ‘This is how I’d set about changing the notes: I’d count over the first thousand, say four times, beginning at this end and then at that one, looking closely at every note, and then I’d start on the second thousand. I’d start counting it, get halfway through, and then pull out some fifty-rouble note or other, hold it up to the light, turn it over and hold it up again, checking to see if it was a fake. “I’m concerned”, I’d say, “because a relation of mine was swindled out of twenty-five roubles this way the other day.” And I’d tell the whole story. And then when I started counting the third thousand—no, I’m sorry, I’d probably have made a mistake in the second thousand, I’d have counted up the seventh hundred wrong, and got worried, and I’d drop the third thousand and go back to the second one—and go on like that through the whole five thousand. And when I finished, I’d take out a note from the fifth thousand, and another one from the second, and hold them up to the light again, and get all worried and say “would you change these, please?”—and I’d get the clerk into such a state that he just couldn’t wait to get shot of me! And when I was all done, I’d go to the door and open it—and no, I’d come back again and ask about something, get something explained to me. That’s how I’d do it!’","“I would do it differently,” Raskolnikov began. “This is how I would change the notes: I’d count the first thousand three or four times backwards and forwards, look at every note and then start on the second thousand; I’d count that halfway through and then hold some fifty ruble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light again—to see whether it was a good one. ‘I’m afraid,’ I would say. ‘A relation of mine lost twenty-five rubles the other day because of a false note,’ and then I’d tell them the whole story. And after I began counting the third, ‘no, excuse me,’ I would say, ‘I think I made a mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.’ And so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and so on to the end. And when I had finished, I’d pick out one from the fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light and ask again ‘change them, please,’ and put the clerk into such a stew that he would not know how to get rid of me. When I’d finished and had gone out, I’d come back, ‘No, excuse me,’ and ask for some explanation. That’s how I’d do it.”"

"– Успокойтесь, маменька, – отвечала Дуня, снимая с себя шляпку и мантильку, – нам сам бог послал этого господина, хоть он и прямо с какой-то попойки. На него можно положиться, уверяю вас. И все, что он уже сделал для брата…","“Calm down, mother,” answered Dunya, taking off her hat and mantle, “God himself sent this gentleman to us, even though he was straight from some kind of drinking party.

Он видел, что и эта с любовью пришла к нему.","“Don’t be angry, brother, I’m only for one minute,” Dunya said. Her expression was thoughtful, but not stern. The look was clear and quiet. He saw that this one came to him with love.","“Don’t be angry, brother; I’ve come for only a few minutes,” Dunya said. Her expression was thoughtful, but not stern. Her gaze was clear and calm. He saw that this woman had also come to him in love.","‘Don’t be angry with me, brother, I’ve just come for a minute,’ said Dunia.

"– Точно так-с, Авдотья Романовна, – внушительно проговорил Петр Петрович, присев опять на стул, но все еще сохраняя шляпу в руках, – я действительно желал объясниться и с вами, и с многоуважаемою вашею мамашей, и даже о весьма важных пунктах. Но как и брат ваш не может при мне объясниться насчет некоторых предложений господина Свидригайлова, так и я не желаю и не могу объясниться… при других… насчет некоторых весьма и весьма важных пунктов. К тому же капитальная и убедительнейшая просьба моя не была исполнена…","“Exactly so, Avdotya Romanovna,” Pyotr Petrovich said impressively, sitting down again on a chair, but still keeping his hat in his hands, “I really wanted to explain myself to you and to your esteemed mother, and even about very important points. But just as your brother cannot explain himself to me about some of Mr. Svidrigailov's proposals, so I do not want and cannot explain myself ... in front of others ... about some very, very important points. In addition, my capital and most convincing request was not fulfilled ...","“Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,” Petr Petrovich said imposingly, sitting down in his chair again, but keeping his hat in his hands. “I really did wish to have a discussion with you and your much-esteemed mother, even about some very important matters. But just as your brother can’t discuss certain proposals made by Mr. Svidrigaylov in my presence, I also don’t wish and can’t converse . . . in the presence of others . . . about certain extremely, extremely important matters. Besides, my principal and most pressing request was not fulfilled . . .”","‘That is so, Avdotya Romanovna,’ said Piotr Petrovich majestically, sitting down on his chair again but keeping hold of his hat. ‘I did indeed wish to have matters out with both you and your respected Mamasha—matters of considerable importance, in fact. But, just as your brother is unable to explain to you in my presence certain proposals of Mr Svidrigailov’s, so I too do not wish, and am unable, to discuss… in the presence of other people… certain most, most important matters. Moreover, my overriding and most earnest request has not been complied with…’","“Precisely so, Avdotia Romanovna,” Peter Petrovich answered impressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat. “I certainly desired to sort out a very important point with you and your mother, whom I respect so highly. But as your brother cannot speak openly in my presence about Mr. Svidrigailov’s proposals, I, too, do not desire and am not able to speak openly . . . in the presence of others . . . about certain matters of the greatest importance. Moreover, my most insistent and urgent request has been disregarded . . . ”"
"Утро, последовавшее за роковым для Петра Петровича объяснением с Дунечкой и с Пульхерией Александровной, принесло свое отрезвляющее действие и на Петра Петровича. Он, к величайшей своей неприятности, принужден был мало-помалу принять за факт, совершившийся и невозвратимый, то, что вчера еще казалось ему происшествием почти фантастическим, и хотя и сбывшимся, но все-таки как будто еще невозможным. Черный змей ужаленного самолюбия всю ночь сосал его сердце. Встав с постели, Петр Петрович тотчас же посмотрелся в зеркало. Он опасался, не разлилась ли в нем за ночь желчь? Однако с этой стороны все было, покамест, благополучно, и, посмотрев на свой благородный, белый и немного ожиревший в последнее время облик, Петр Петрович даже на мгновение утешился, в полнейшем убеждении сыскать себе невесту где-нибудь в другом месте, да, пожалуй, еще и почище; но тотчас же опомнился и энергически плюнул в сторону, чем вызвал молчаливую, но саркастическую улыбку в молодом своем друге и сожителе Андрее Семеновиче Лебезятникове. Улыбку эту Петр Петрович заметил и про себя тотчас же поставил ее молодому своему другу на счет. Он уже много успел поставить ему в последнее время на счет. Злоба его удвоилась, когда он вдруг сообразил, что не следовало бы сообщать вчера о вчерашних результатах Андрею Семеновичу. Это была вторая вчерашняя ошибка, сделанная им сгоряча, от излишней экспансивности, в раздражении… Затем, во все это утро, как нарочно, следовала неприятность за неприятностью. Даже в сенате ждала его какая-то неудача по делу, о котором он там хлопотал. Особенно же раздражил его хозяин квартиры, нанятой им в видах скорой женитьбы и отделываемой на собственный счет: этот хозяин, какой-то разбогатевший немецкий ремесленник, ни за что не соглашался нарушить только что совершенный контракт и требовал полной прописанной в контракте неустойки, несмотря на то, что Петр Петрович возвращал ему квартиру почти заново отделанную. Точно так же и в мебельном магазине ни за что не хотели возвратить ни одного рубля из задатка за купленную, но еще не перевезенную в квартиру мебель. «Не нарочно же мне жениться для мебели!» – скрежетал про себя Петр Петрович, и в то же время еще раз мелькнула в нем отчаянная надежда: «Да неужели же в самом деле все это так безвозвратно пропало и кончилось? Неужели нельзя еще раз попытаться?» Мысль о Дунечке еще раз соблазнительно занозила его сердце. С мучением перенес он эту минуту и уж, конечно, если бы можно было сейчас, одним только желанием, умертвить Раскольникова, то Петр Петрович немедленно произнес бы это желание.","The morning that followed Pyotr Petrovich's fateful explanation with Dunechka and Pulcheria Alexandrovna had a sobering effect on Pyotr Petrovich as well. To his greatest annoyance, he was forced little by little to accept as a fact, accomplished and irrevocable, what yesterday still seemed to him an almost fantastic incident, and although it had come true, it still seemed to be still impossible. The black serpent of stung pride sucked his heart all night. Getting out of bed, Pyotr Petrovich immediately looked in the mirror. He was afraid that bile had spilled into him during the night? However, on this side, everything was, for the time being, all right, and, looking at his noble, white and a little obese appearance of late, Pyotr Petrovich even consoled himself for a moment, in the uttermost conviction to find a bride for himself somewhere else, yes, perhaps , even cleaner; but he immediately came to his senses and energetically spat to the side, which caused a silent but sarcastic smile in his young friend and roommate Andrei Semenovich Lebezyatnikov. Pyotr Petrovich noticed this smile, and silently put it down to his young friend at once. He has already managed to bet a lot on his account lately. His anger redoubled when he suddenly realized that he shouldn't have reported yesterday's results to Andrey Semyonovich. It was yesterday's second mistake, made by him in haste, from excessive expansiveness, in irritation ... Then, all this morning, as if on purpose, trouble followed trouble. Even in the Senate, some kind of setback awaited him in the case he was busy with there. He was especially annoyed by the owner of the apartment he had hired in the form of an early marriage and getting off at his own expense: this owner, some kind of wealthy German artisan, would never agree to violate the contract that had just been completed and demanded the full penalty prescribed in the contract, despite the fact that that Pyotr Petrovich returned to him an apartment almost refinished. In the same way, in a furniture store they would never return a single ruble from the deposit for furniture purchased but not yet transported to the apartment. “It’s not on purpose that I should marry for furniture!” Pyotr Petrovich gnashed to himself, and at the same time a desperate hope flashed through him once again: “Is it really all gone so irretrievably and ended? Can't you try again?"" The thought of Dounia once again seductively pierced his heart. He endured that moment with torment, and, of course, if it were possible now, with only one desire, to kill Raskolnikov, then Pyotr Petrovich would immediately utter this desire.","The morning that followed Petr Petrovich’s fateful meeting with Dunechka and Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna produced a sobering effect on him as well. To his extreme displeasure, he was compelled little by little to accept as an accomplished and irrevocable fact what yesterday had seemed to him to be an almost fantastic occurrence, still inconceivable, even after it had actually occurred. The black serpent of wounded self-esteem had been sucking the blood out of his heart all night. The moment he got out of bed, Petr Petrovich looked at himself in the mirror. He was afraid that he might have had a bilious attack during the night. However, on that score, all was well for the time being; after seeing his pale, dignified face, which had grown fuller of late, Petr Petrovich even felt consoled for a moment in the full conviction that he could find another bride somewhere else, and she might even be a better one; but he immediately came to his senses and spat vigorously to one side, which caused his young friend and roommate, Andrey Semyonovich Lebezyatnikov to smile sarcastically. Petr Petrovich noticed this smile and immediately held it against his young friend. Lately he’d found many things to hold against him. His anger was redoubled when he suddenly realized that he shouldn’t have told Andrey Semyonovich about the results of yesterday’s interview. That was his second mistake yesterday, done in the heat of the moment, as a result of excessive expansiveness, in a moment of irritation. . . . Then, all that morning, as if intentionally, one unpleasantness followed another. Even in the Senate a setback awaited him in the case he was pursuing. He was especially annoyed by the landlord of the apartment he had rented in view of his imminent marriage and decorated at his own expense: this landlord, a German tradesman who had become rich, would under no circumstance agree to cancel the contract that had just been signed, and demanded all of the penalties specified therein, in spite of the fact that Petr Petrovich was returning the apartment to him almost completely redecorated. It was the same in the furniture shop, where they didn’t want to refund even one ruble of his deposit for the furniture he had purchased, but which had still not been delivered to the apartment. “After all, I’m not going to get married just because I bought some furniture!” Petr Petrovich said to himself, grinding his teeth; and yet at the same time a desperate hope occurred to him once again: “Has this all really fallen through and is it over and done with once and for all? Is it really impossible to attempt it once more?” The thought of Dunechka was gnawing seductively at his heart. He experienced this moment with agony, and, of course, if he could have killed Raskolnikov just then by his wish alone, Petr Petrovich would have carried out that desire at once.","The morning following Piotr Petrovich’s fateful meeting with Dunechka and Pulkheria Alexandrovna exerted its sobering effect even on Piotr Petrovich. To his great displeasure, he was obliged little by little to accept as an accomplished and irreversible fact, what had yesterday still appeared to him as an almost fantastical event, something which, although it had actually happened, still seemed almost impossible to him. The black serpent of injured vanity had gnawed at his heart all night. As soon as he got up, Piotr Petrovich looked at himself in the mirror. He was afraid he might look bilious after that night. But so far all was well on that front, and when he saw his distinguished, pale features—a little plumper now than they used to be—Piotr Petrovich was almost reassured for a moment, and felt quite certain that he’d find himself another bride, very likely an even better one, somewhere else. But he quickly pulled himself together and spat vigorously to one side, provoking a silent but sarcastic smile from his young friend and fellow lodger Andrei Semionovich Lebeziatnikov. Piotr Petrovich noted that smile and at once mentally set it down against his young friend’s account. He had recently had occasion to set a lot of things down on that account. And his anger redoubled when he realized that he ought never to have told Andrei Semionovich about what had happened the day before. That had been his second impulsive mistake that day, committed when annoyance had made him overconfiding… And all that morning, one unpleasantness had followed another, as though on purpose to vex him. Even in the Senate he had met with a setback in the case he was pursuing there. But he was particularly irritated by the landlord of the lodgings which he had taken with a view to an early marriage, and had decorated at his own expense. This landlord, a prosperous German tradesman, was resolutely refusing to cancel the contract they had just concluded, and insisting on the full penalties set down in that contract, despite the fact that Piotr Petrovich was handing him back the flat almost freshly redecorated. And the furniture shop, too, was flatly refusing to pay him back a single rouble of the deposit he had put down for furniture which he had bought but not yet had delivered to the flat. ‘I won’t get married just for the sake of the furniture!’ muttered Piotr Petrovich, grinding his teeth; and at the same moment the desperate hope once more flashed through his mind: ‘But has it all really fallen through, is it really all over, is there no hope of recovery? Can I really not have another try?’ The seductive thought of Dunechka once again shot a pang through his heart. It was a moment of torment for him; and if he could, just by wishing it, have killed Raskolnikov at that instant, then Piotr Petrovich would of course have wished it at once.","THE MORNING THAT FOLLOWED the fateful interview with Dunia and her mother brought sobering influences to bear on Peter Petrovich. Intensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept as an unshakeable fact what had seemed to him only the day before to be fantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had been gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Peter Petrovich immediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he had jaundice. However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at his noble, clear-skinned face which had recently grown fattish, Peter Petrovich for an instant was positively comforted in the conviction that he would find another bride, and perhaps even a better one. But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned aside and spat vigorously, which provoked a sarcastic smile in Andrei Semionovich Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying. Peter Petrovich noticed that smile, and held it against his young friend at once. He had recently held many things against him. His anger was doubled when he reflected that he ought not to have told Andrei Semionovich about the result of yesterday’s interview. That was the second mistake he had made in his temper, through impulsiveness and irritability . . . Moreover, all morning one unpleasantness followed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case in the Senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the apartment which had been taken due to his approaching marriage and was being redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman, would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Peter Petrovich would be giving him back the apartment practically redecorated. In the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single ruble of the installment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the apartment. “Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?” Peter Petrovich ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a gleam of desperate hope. “Can it all really be over so irrevocably? Is it no use to make another effort?” The thought of Dunia sent a voluptuous pang through his heart. He went through agonies at that moment, and if it had been possible to kill Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it, Peter Petrovich would promptly have uttered the wish."

"– Быть не может, обоих освободят. Во-первых, все противоречит; судите: зачем им дворника звать, если б это их дело? На себя доносить, что ли? Аль для хитрости? Нет, уж было бы слишком хитро! И, наконец, студента Пестрякова видели у самых ворот оба дворника и мещанка, в самую ту минуту, как он входил: он шел с тремя приятелями и расстался с ними у самых ворот и о жительстве у дворников расспрашивал, еще при приятелях. Ну станет такой о жительстве расспрашивать, если с таким намерением шел? А Кох, так тот, прежде чем к старухе заходить, внизу у серебряника полчаса сидел и ровно без четверти восемь от него к старухе наверх пошел. Теперь сообразите…","- It cannot be, both will be released. First, everything contradicts; judge: why should they call the janitor if it was their business? To inform yourself, or what? Al for stealth? No, it would be too tricky! And, finally, the student Pestryakov was seen at the very gate by both the janitors and the bourgeois woman, at the very moment he entered: he was walking with three friends and parted with them at the very gates and asked about the janitors' residence, even in the presence of friends. Well, will he ask about the residence, if he walked with such an intention? And Koch, so, before entering the old woman, he sat down at the silversmith for half an hour and went upstairs from him to the old woman exactly at a quarter to eight. Now consider ...","“It can’t be; they’ll release both of them! In the first place, it contradicts everything. Judge for yourself: why should they call the caretaker, if they’d done the deed? To implicate themselves? Or is it a clever trick? No, that would be too clever! Moreover, both caretakers and the woman trader saw the student Pestryakov near the gates just as he was arriving: he was out there with three friends, parted from them near the gate, and asked the caretakers about residence in the building in the presence of these friends. Well, would someone ask about residence if he’d come with such an intention?

Now just consider . . .”","‘Absolutely impossible! They’ll both be released. Firstly, it’s full of contradictions. Just think—why fetch the porter, if they’d done it? To incriminate themselves? Or was that a cunning ploy? No, too cunning by half! And then, both porters and a housewife saw the student Pestryakov just as he was entering the gate; he was walking with three friends, and separated from them right by the gate, and he asked the porter about who lived there, while his friends were still with him. Well, would someone like that have been asking about the residents if he was planning to do that? And as for Koch, before going up to the old woman he’d spent half an hour with the silversmith downstairs, and it was just a quarter to eight when he left him to go upstairs to her flat. Just think about it…’","“It’s impossible, they’ll both be released. To begin with, the whole story contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter, if it had been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No, that would be too cunning! Besides, Pestriakov, the student, was seen at the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walking with three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the porters to direct him, in the presence of his friends. Now, would he have asked his way if he had been going with a purpose like that? As for Koch, he spent half an hour at the silver-smith’s below, before he went up to the old woman, and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Now just consider . . . ”"

"– Как хотите, я не для вас. Пей, Катя! Сегодня ничего больше не понадобится, ступай! – Он налил ей целый стакан вина и выложил желтенький билетик.[78] Катя выпила стакан разом, как пьют вино женщины, то есть не отрываясь, в двадцать глотков, взяла билетик, поцеловала у Свидригайлова руку, которую тот весьма серьезно допустил поцеловать, и вышла из комнаты, а за нею потащился и мальчишка с органом. Оба они были приведены с улицы. Свидригайлов и недели не жил в Петербурге, а уж все около него было на какой-то патриархальной ноге. Трактирный лакей, Филипп, тоже был уже «знакомый» и подобострастничал. Дверь в залу запиралась; Свидригайлов в этой комнате был как у себя и проводил в ней, может быть, целые дни. Трактир был грязный, дрянной и даже не средней руки.","- As you wish, I'm not for you. Drink, Katya! Nothing else is needed today, go! He poured her a whole glass of wine and laid out a little yellow ticket.[78] Katya drank a glass at once, as women drink wine, that is, without looking up, in twenty sips, took a ticket, kissed Svidrigailov's hand, which he very seriously allowed to kiss, and left the room, and the boy with the organ dragged behind her. Both of them were brought from the street. Svidrigailov did not live in St. Petersburg even for a week, and everything around him was on some kind of patriarchal footing. The tavern footman, Philip, was also already ""familiar"" and obsequious. The door to the hall was locked; Svidrigailov felt at home in this room and spent, perhaps, whole days in it. The tavern was dirty, cheesy and not even average.","“As you like. That’s not for you. Drink up, Katya! Nothing more’s needed today. Go away!” He poured her a full glass of wine and put down a yellow banknote. Katya drank the glass at one go, the way women usually drink, that is, in twenty gulps, without pausing; she took the banknote, kissed Svidrigaylov’s hand, which he had solemnly extended to her for that reason, and left the room; the boy with the hand organ trailed along after her. They had both been brought in from the street. Svidrigaylov hadn’t been in Petersburg a week, but everything around him was already on a patriarchal footing. The waiter at the tavern, Filipp, was already an “acquaintance” and fawned over him. The door to the larger room could be locked; Svidrigaylov felt at home in this little room and may have spent entire days in it. The tavern was dirty, dilapidated, and not even of average quality.","‘Just as you like, I didn’t mean you. Drink up, Katya! Run along now , I shan’t be needing you any more today.’ He poured her a full glass of champagne and put a yellow banknote* on the table. Katya drained the whole glass, drinking her wine the way women do, taking twenty gulps straight off without drawing breath; then she picked up the money, kissed Svidrigailov’s hand which he solemnly let her take, and left the room, the little boy trailing behind her with his barrel organ. They had both been brought in off the street. Svidrigailov hadn’t been in Petersburg a week before he had organized everything around him as though he were some sort of patriarch. Filipp the tavern waiter had already become his ‘old friend’ and grovelled obsequiously to him. The door to the saloon would be locked for him; Svidrigailov treated this room as his home and might spend the whole day there. The tavern was mean and dirty and worse than third-rate.","“As you wish, I didn’t intend it to be for you. Drink, Katia! I don’t want anything else today, you can go.” He poured her a full glass, and laid out a yellow note. Katia drank up her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down, in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigailov’s hand, which he allowed her to do quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed after her with the organ. Both of them had been brought in from the street. Svidrigailov had not even been in Petersburg a week, but everything about him was already, so to speak, in patriarchal mode; the waiter, Philip, was by now an old friend and had fallen right under his thumb. The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidrigailov was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern was dirty and wretched, not even second rate."

"«Действительно, я у Разумихина недавно еще хотел было работы просить, чтоб он мне или уроки достал, или что-нибудь… – додумывался Раскольников, – но чем теперь-то он мне может помочь?

На пятаки-то что ж я сделаю? Мне разве того теперь надобно? Право, смешно, что я пошел к Разумихину…»","“Indeed, I recently wanted to ask Razumikhin for work, so that he could get me some lessons, or something…” Raskolnikov thought, “but how can he help me now? Suppose he gets the lessons, suppose he even shares his last penny if he has a penny, so you can even buy boots and fix a suit so that you can go to lessons ... um ... Well, and then? For pennies, what am I going to do? Do I really need that now? Really, it's funny that I went to Razumikhin ... ""","“As a matter of fact, for some time I’ve been wanting to ask Razumikhin for work, to arrange some lessons or something else for me . . .” Raskolnikov thought, having hit upon this idea, “but how can he help me now? Suppose he does arrange some lessons, suppose he even shares his last kopecks with me, if he has any to share, so that I could even buy some boots, have my clothes mended, and offer some lessons . . . hmm. Well, and then what? What can I do with a few five-kopeck pieces? Do I really need that now? In truth, it’s ridiculous that I’ve set out to see Razumikhin . . .”","‘True enough, not so long ago I meant to ask Razumikhin for work—get him to find me some lessons or something like that…’ recalled Raskolnikov, ‘but how can he help me right now? I suppose he could get me some lessons; I suppose he’ll even share his last kopek with me, if he has a kopek; so I could actually buy myself some boots, and get my suit mended, so that I could go out to give lessons… hmm… Well, and after that? What can I do with a few coppers? Is that what I need now? No, really, it was ridiculous to set out for Razumikhin’s.’","“OF COURSE, I’VE BEEN meaning lately to go to Razumikhin’s to ask for work, to ask him to get me lessons or something . . . ” Raskolnikov thought, “but what help can he be to me now?

Well and what then? What will I do with the few coppers I earn? That’s not what I want now. It’s really absurd for me to go to Razumikhin . . . ”"
"– Я хотел вас спросить, – обратился к ней поскорей Раскольников, – как это у вас сегодня устроилось?

"– Ах, Родя, ты не поверишь, – подхватила она вдруг, спеша ответить на его замечание, – как мы с Дунечкой вчера были… несчастны! Теперь, как уж все прошло и кончилось и все мы опять счастливы, – можно рассказать. Вообрази, бежим сюда, чтоб обнять тебя, чуть не прямо из вагона, а эта женщина, – а, да вот она! Здравствуй, Настасья!.. Говорит она нам вдруг, что ты лежишь в белой горячке и только что убежал тихонько от доктора, в бреду, на улицу и что тебя побежали отыскивать. Ты не поверишь, что с нами было! Мне как раз представилось, как трагически погиб поручик Потанчиков, наш знакомый, друг твоего отца, – ты его не помнишь, Родя, – тоже в белой горячке и таким же образом выбежал и на дворе в колодезь упал, на другой только день могли вытащить. А мы, конечно, еще более преувеличили. Хотели было броситься отыскивать Петра Петровича, чтобы хоть с его помощию… потому что ведь мы были одни, совершенно одни, – протянула она жалобным голосом и вдруг совсем осеклась, вспомнив, что заговаривать о Петре Петровиче еще довольно опасно, несмотря на то, «что все уже опять совершенно счастливы».","“Ah, Rodya, you won’t believe it,” she suddenly picked up, hurrying to answer his remark, “how Dunechka and I were ... unhappy yesterday!” Now, how everything has passed and ended, and we are all happy again, - you can tell. Imagine, we run here to hug you, almost straight out of the car, and this woman - oh, yes, there she is! Hello, Nastasya! .. She suddenly tells us that you are lying in a delirium tremens and have just run away quietly from the doctor, delirious, into the street and that they ran to look for you. You won't believe what happened to us! I just imagined how tragically died Lieutenant Potanchikov, our friend, your father’s friend—you don’t remember him, Rodya—also in delirium tremens and ran out in the same way and fell into a well in the yard, they could only pull him out the next day. And we, of course, exaggerated even more. We wanted to rush off to look for Pyotr Petrovich, so that at least with his help ... because after all we were alone, completely alone, ”she drawled out in a plaintive voice and suddenly stopped completely, remembering that it was still quite dangerous to talk about Pyotr Petrovich, despite the fact “that everyone is completely happy again.”","“Ah, Rodya, you won’t believe,” she began suddenly, hastening to reply to his remark, “how . . . miserable Dunechka and I were yesterday! Now all that’s over and done with and we can say that we’re all happy again. Imagine, we came rushing over here to embrace you, almost right from the train, and this woman—ah, here she is! Hello, Nastasya! She suddenly tells us that you’re sick and delirious, that in your delirium you just slipped away from the doctor, and they’d gone out to look for you. You can’t believe what that was like! All at once I recalled the tragic end of our acquaintance Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father’s—you don’t remember him, Rodya—he was also delirious, and he too ran away, and fell into a well; they managed to pull him out only a day later. Of course, we imagined even worse things. We wanted to rush off in search of Petr Petrovich, so that at least with his help . . . because we were alone, completely alone,” she said in a plaintive voice and suddenly broke off, having recalled that mentioning Petr Petrovich was still rather dangerous, in spite of the fact that “everyone was completely happy again.”","‘Oh, Rodia, you wouldn’t believe’, she added, hastily responding to his last remark, ‘how… unhappy Dunechka and I were yesterday! Now that it’s all over and done with and we’re all happy again, I can tell you. Just imagine, there we were, almost straight off the train, hurrying to get here and hug you, and that woman —ah, here she is! Hello, Nastasia!… She suddenly told us that you’d been in bed with a raging fever, and you’d just given your doctor the slip, delirious as you were, and secretly gone out, and people were searching for you. You wouldn’t believe what we went through! I was just remembering the tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, your father’s friend, whom we knew—but you won’t remember him, Rodia—he was in a raging fever too, and had run out just like you, and he’d fallen into a well in the courtyard, and they couldn’t pull him out till next day. And of course we were imagining even more dreadful things. We were going to run out to look for Piotr Petrovich, to get him to help… because we were all alone, on our own,’ she went on pitifully, and suddenly stopped short, remembering that talking about Piotr Petrovich was still quite dangerous, in spite of the fact that they were all ‘perfectly happy again’.","“Oh, Rodia, you wouldn’t believe,” she began suddenly, hastily answering his words to her, “how unhappy Dunia and I were yesterday!

Good morning, Nastasia! . . . She told us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the streets.

Of course, we exaggerated things. We were about to rush off and find Peter Petrovich to ask him to help . . . Because we were alone, totally alone,” she said mournfully and stopped short, suddenly, remembering it was still pretty dangerous to speak about Peter Petrovich, although “we are truly happy again.”"

"Идти ему было немного; он даже знал, сколько шагов от ворот его дома: ровно семьсот тридцать. Как-то раз он их сосчитал, когда уж очень размечтался. В то время он и сам еще не верил этим мечтам своим и только раздражал себя их безобразною, но соблазнительною дерзостью. Теперь же, месяц спустя, он уже начинал смотреть иначе и, несмотря на все поддразнивающие монологи о собственном бессилии и нерешимости, «безобразную» мечту как-то даже поневоле привык считать уже предприятием, хотя все еще сам себе не верил. Он даже шел теперь делать пробу своему предприятию, и с каждым шагом волнение его возрастало все сильнее и сильнее.","He had little to go; he even knew how many steps from the gate of his house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. Once he counted them, when he was already very much dreaming. At that time, he himself did not yet believe these dreams of his own and only irritated himself with their ugly, but seductive insolence. Now, a month later, he was already beginning to look differently and, despite all the teasing monologues about his own impotence and indecision, the ""ugly"" dream somehow even involuntarily got used to consider it an enterprise, although he still did not believe himself. He even went now to make a test of his enterprise, and with each step his excitement grew stronger and stronger.","He had only a little way to go; he even knew exactly how many paces it was from the gate of his own building: seven hundred and thirty.

Now, however, a month later, he’d begun to regard them in a different light, and in spite of all his mocking monologues about his own powerlessness and indecisiveness, he’d grown accustomed, even against his will, to considering this “repulsive” dream something of a feat, although he still didn’t believe in it himself. Now he was even on his way to carry out a trial run of his endeavor; with every step his agitation grew stronger and stronger.","He didn’t have far to go; in fact he knew how many paces it was from the gates of his house—just seven hundred and thirty.

But now, a month later, he had already begun to see things differently; and for all his sarcastic monologues about how powerless and indecisive he was, he had somehow, despite himself, got used to regarding this ‘repulsive’ fantasy as a real project, though still without believing in it. He was actually on his way now to carry out a rehearsal of this project, and he grew more and more agitated with every step he took.","He did not have far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate of his house: exactly seven hundred and thirty.

Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at his own impotence and indecision, he had even, involuntarily as it were, come to regard this “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he still did not quite believe in this himself. He was now definitely going for a “rehearsal” of this undertaking of his, and at every step he grew more and more excited."

"Оглядевшись еще раз, он уже засунул и руку в карман, как вдруг у самой наружной стены, между воротами и желобом, где все расстояние было шириною в аршин, заметил он большой неотесанный камень, примерно, может быть, пуда в полтора весу, прилегавший прямо к каменной уличной стене. За этою стеной была улица, тротуар, слышно было, как шныряли прохожие, которых здесь всегда немало; но за воротами его никто не мог увидать, разве зашел бы кто с улицы, что, впрочем, очень могло случиться, а потому надо было спешить.","Looking around again, he had already thrust his hand into his pocket, when suddenly at the very outer wall, between the gate and the gutter, where the entire distance was an arshin width, he noticed a large uncouth stone, about, perhaps, a pound weighing one and a half, lying straight to a stone street wall. Behind this wall there was a street, a sidewalk, you could hear passers-by, of whom there are always a lot of people, darting about; but no one could see him outside the gates, unless someone came from the street, which, incidentally, could very well have happened, and therefore it was necessary to hurry.","Glancing around once more, he had already thrust his hand into his pocket when he suddenly noticed by the outer wall, between the gate and the trench, where the distance was about a yard wide, a large unworked block, weighing perhaps as much as fifty pounds, leaning directly against the stone wall.

It was leaning directly against the street wall. Beyond the wall was the street, with a pavement along which passers-by could be heard hurrying this way and that; there were always a lot of people about here. And yet behind the gates no one could see him, unless someone were to walk in from the street—which as a matter of fact might quite easily happen, so he had to be quick.","Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big uncut stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a street. He could hear passersby, always numerous in that part, but he could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the street, which might well happen, in fact, so he needed to hurry."

I can’t lose any more time. The desk’s locked up, the apartment’s locked up, and we’re back on the staircase. Well, if you like, we can hire a cab! I’m heading to the Islands.

"Он привел Авдотью Романовну обратно в свою первую комнату, служившую ему залой, и пригласил ее сесть на стул. Сам сел на другом конце стола, по крайней мере, от нее на сажень, но, вероятно, в глазах его уже блистал тот же самый пламень, который так испугал когда-то Дунечку. Она вздрогнула и еще раз недоверчиво осмотрелась. Жест ее был невольный; ей, видимо, не хотелось выказывать недоверчивости. Но уединенное положение квартиры Свидригайлова, наконец, ее поразило. Ей хотелось спросить, дома ли, по крайней мере, его хозяйка, но она не спросила… из гордости. К тому же и другое, несоразмерно большее страдание, чем страх за себя, было в ее сердце. Она нестерпимо мучилась.","He brought Avdotya Romanovna back to his first room, which served as his hall, and invited her to sit on a chair.

She shuddered and looked around again in disbelief. Her gesture was involuntary; she didn't seem to want to show incredulity. But the secluded position of Svidrigailov's apartment finally struck her. She wanted to ask if at least his mistress was home, but she didn't ask... out of pride. Moreover, another, disproportionately greater suffering than fear for herself was in her heart.

But the isolated situation of Svidrigaylov’s apartment finally struck her. She wanted to ask if at least his landlady was home, but she didn’t say anything . . . out of pride.

But she had suddenly been struck by the isolated situation of Svidrigailov’s apartment. She wanted to ask him whether his landlady, at least, was at home; but she didn’t ask… out of pride. And besides, her heart was filled with anguish of a different sort, infinitely worse than any fear for her own safety.

Only a monster and a scoundrel, if not a madman, could do to them the way you did; so you're crazy...","“Ah! He’s eating; therefore he’s not ill!” said Razumikhin. He took a chair and sat down opposite Raskolnikov. He was agitated and didn’t try to hide it. He spoke with visible annoyance, but without hurrying or raising his voice. One could conclude that some sort of special intention, even an exclusive one, had lodged in his mind. “Listen,” he began decisively, “as far as I’m concerned, you can all go to the devil. But from what I know now, I clearly see that I can’t understand a thing; please, don’t think I came to interrogate you. I don’t give a damn! I don’t want to! If you were now to reveal all your secrets to me, I might not even listen; I might just spit and walk away. I’ve come merely to find out for myself once and for all: in the first place, is it true you’re mad? You see, there’s a belief about you (out there, somewhere) that you might be insane or close to it. I confess, I myself was strongly inclined to support that opinion, judging, in the first place, from your stupid and somewhat vile actions (completely inexplicable) and, in the second, from your recent conduct toward your mother and sister. Only a monster and a scoundrel, if not a madman, could behave with them the way you did; consequently, you are insane . . .”","‘Aha! He’s eating— that proves he’s not ill!’ said Razumikhin, getting a chair and sitting down at the table opposite Raskolnikov. He was agitated, and made no attempt to hide the fact. He spoke in evident annoyance, but without hurrying or particularly raising his voice. One might have thought he had some very special fixed purpose. ‘Listen,’ he began firmly, ‘I don’t care a damn about any of you, but it’s obvious, as far as I can see, that I don’t understand a thing about what’s going on. Please don’t imagine that I’m here to question you. I don’t care a bit! I don’t want to know! If you were to tell me everything now, all your secrets, I might not even listen to you; I’d just say to hell with you, and walk out. All I’ve come for is to find out for myself, once and for all, whether it’s actually true that you’re mad. You see, there’s a belief in certain quarters (well, some people out there) that you’re either mad or very liable to become so. I admit that I felt very much like agreeing with them myself, partly because of your own stupid and sometimes revolting behaviour (which nothing could justify), and partly because of the way you’ve been treating your mother and sister. Only a villain and a monster, or else a madman, could have treated them the way you did; so you’ve got to be mad…’","He took a chair and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov. He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident annoyance, but without hurrying or raising his voice. He looked as though he had some special fixed determination. “Listen,” he began resolutely. “As far as I’m concerned, you can all go to hell, but from what I see, it’s clear to me that I can’t make head or tail of it; please don’t think I’ve come to ask you questions. I don’t want to know, damn it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I don’t think I’d stay to listen, I’d go away cursing. I have only come to find out once for all whether it’s a fact that you are mad? There is a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit I’ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid, repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have; so you must be mad.”"

"– Да, бишь! Ну, слушай историю: ровно на третий день после убийства, поутру, когда они там нянчились еще с Кохом да Пестряковым, – хотя те каждый свой шаг доказали: очевидность кричит! – объявляется вдруг самый неожиданный факт. Некто крестьянин Душкин, содержатель распивочной, напротив того самого дома, является в контору и приносит ювелирский футляр с золотыми серьгами и рассказывает целую повесть: «Прибежал-де ко мне повечеру, третьего дня, примерно в начале девятого, – день и час! вникаешь? – работник красильщик, который и до этого ко мне на дню забегал, Миколай, и принес мне ефту коробку, с золотыми сережками и с камушками, и просил за них под заклад два рубля, а на мой спрос: где взял? – объявил, что на панели поднял. Больше я его на том не расспрашивал, – это Душкин-то говорит, – а вынес ему билетик – рубль то есть, – потому-де думал, что не мне, так другому заложит; все одно – пропьет, а пусть лучше у меня вещь лежит: дальше-де положишь, ближе возьмешь, а объявится что аль слухи пойдут, тут я и преставлю». Ну, конечно, бабушкин сон рассказывает, врет, как лошадь, потому я этого Душкина знаю, сам он закладчик и краденое прячет, и тридцатирублевую вещь не для того, чтоб «преставить», у Миколая подтибрил. Просто струсил. Ну да к черту, слушай; продолжает Душкин: «А крестьянина ефтова, Миколая Дементьева, знаю сызмалетства, нашей губернии и уезда, Зарайского, потому-де мы сами рязанские. А Миколай хоть не пьяница, а выпивает, и известно нам было, что он в ефтом самом доме работает, красит, вместе с Митрием, а с Митрием они из однех местов. И получимши билетик, он его тотчас разменял, выпил зараз два стаканчика, сдачу взял и пошел, а Митрея я с ним в тот час не видал. А на другой день прослышали мы, что Алену Ивановну и сестрицу их Лизавету Ивановну топором убили, а мы их знавали-с, и взяло меня тут сумление насчет серег, – потому известно нам было, что покойница под вещи деньги давала. Пошел я к ним в дом и стал осторожно про себя узнавать, тихими стопами, и перво-наперво спросил: тут ли Миколай? И сказывал Митрей, что Миколай загулял, пришел домой на рассвете, пьяный, дома пробыл примерно десять минут и опять ушел, а Митрей уж его потом не видал и работу один доканчивает. А работа у них по одной лестнице с убитыми, во втором этаже. Слышамши все это, мы тогда никому ничего не открыли, – это Душкин говорит, – а про убийство все, что могли, разузнали и воротились домой всё в том же нашем сумлении. А сегодня поутру, в восемь часов, – то есть это на третий-то день, понимаешь? – вижу, входит ко мне Миколай, не тверезый, да и не то чтоб очень пьяный, а понимать разговор может. Сел на лавку, молчит. А опричь него в распивочной на ту пору был всего один человек посторонний, да еще спал на лавке другой, по знакомству, да двое наших мальчишков-с. „Видел, спрашиваю, Митрея?“ – „Нет, говорит, не видал“. – „И здесь не был?“ – „Не был, говорит, с третьего дни“. – „А ноне где ночевал?“ – „А на Песках, говорит, у коломенских“. – „А где, говорю, тогда серьги взял?“ – „А на панели нашел“, – и говорит он это так, как будто бы неподобно и не глядя. „А слышал, говорю, что вот то и то, в тот самый вечер и в том часу, по той лестнице, произошло?“ – „Нет, говорит, не слыхал“, – а сам слушает, глаза вытараща, и побелел он вдруг, ровно мел. Я, этта, ему рассказываю, смотрю, а он за шапку и начал вставать. Тут и захотел я его задержать: „Погоди, Миколай, говорю, аль не выпьешь?“ А сам мигнул мальчишке, чтобы дверь придержал, да из-за застойки-то выхожу: как он тут от меня прыснет, да на улицу, да бегом, да в проулок, – только я и видел его. Тут я и сумления моего решился, потому его грех, как есть…»","- Yes, I mean! Well, listen to the story: exactly on the third day after the murder, in the morning, when they were still babysitting with Koch and Pestryakov, although they proved their every step: the obviousness screams! - suddenly the most unexpected fact is announced. Some peasant Dushkin, a keeper of a tavern, opposite the same house, comes to the office and brings a jewelry case with gold earrings and tells a whole story: “He came running to me in the evening, the third day, at about the beginning of the ninth, day and hour! do you understand? - a dyer worker who had come running to me for the day, Mikolay, and brought me a box of efta, with gold earrings and pebbles, and asked for them on a mortgage of two rubles, and on my demand: where did he get it? - announced that he raised on the panel. I didn’t ask him more about that, - this is Dushkin saying, - but I gave him a ticket — a ruble, that is, —that is why I thought that it would not be me, he would lay it down for someone else; all the same - he will drink, but let it be better with me the thing is: put it further, take it closer, and it will be announced that al rumors will go, and then I will put it down. "" Well, of course, grandma’s dream tells, she’s lying like a horse, because I know this Dushkin, he himself hides stolen goods, and he didn’t tame the thirty-ruble thing with Mikolai. I just got cold feet. Well, to hell with that, listen; Dushkin continues: “And the peasant Eftov, Mikolai Dementyev, I know from childhood, our province and district, Zaraisk, because we ourselves are Ryazan. And Mikolai, though not a drunkard, is a drinker, and we knew that he works in this very house, paints, together with Mitri, and with Mitri they are from the same places. And when we got the ticket, he immediately changed it, drank two glasses at a time, took the change and went, but I didn't see Mitreus with him at that hour. And the next day we heard that Alena Ivanovna and their sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, had been killed with an ax, and we knew them, sir, and the thought about earrings took me here - because we knew that the deceased gave money for things. I went to their house and began to carefully inquire about myself, with quiet steps, and first of all asked: is Mikolai here? And Mitreus said that Mikolai went on a spree, came home at dawn, drunk, stayed at home for about ten minutes and left again, but Mitreus did not see him later and was finishing his work alone. And their work is on the same staircase with the dead, on the second floor. Hearing all this, we then did not reveal anything to anyone, - this is Dushkin says, - but about the murder we found out everything we could and returned home in the same confusion of ours. And today in the morning, at eight o'clock - that is, on the third day, do you understand? - I see Mikolai comes in to me, not tough, and not that very drunk, but he can understand the conversation. He sat down on the bench and was silent. And at that time there was only one stranger to shade him in the tavern, and even another, by an acquaintance, slept on the bench, and two of our boys, sir. “Did you see, I ask, Mitreya?” - “No, he says, I haven’t seen.” - ""And have not been here?"" - ""He has not been, he says, from the third day."" - “But where did you spend the night?” - “And where, I say, did you get the earrings?” “Did I hear, I say that this and that, on that very evening and at that hour, on that staircase, did it happen?” , exactly chalk. I, etta, tell him, look, and he began to get up by his hat. Then I wanted to detain him: “Wait, Mikolai, I say, will you drink? , yes into the alley - only I saw him. Here I also decided my thoughts, because his sin, as it is ... ""","“Well, of course! Then listen to the story: exactly three days after the murder, in the morning, they were still fussing over Kokh and Pestryakov, even though those two were able to account for their every step. The evidence was unmistakable! All of a sudden, the most unexpected fact was announced. A certain peasant named Dushkin, the keeper of a tavern opposite that same building, appears in the office and brings in a jewelry case with gold earrings and tells a whole long tale: ‘A fellow comes runnin’ in two days ago,’ he says, ‘toward evenin’, just after eight o’clock.’ You hear? The day and the hour! ‘ A painter who’d come to see me before durin’ the day; his name is Mikolai, and he brings in this here box of gold earrin’s with little gemstones, and asks for two rubles in exchange. When I ask him where he got ’em, he says he’d found ’em in the street. I didn’t ask him any more about it’—that’s Dushkin speaking—‘and I gave him a note, that is, a ruble, because I thought if he didn’t get it from me, he’d get it from someone else , it’s all the same— he’ll drink it up, so it’s better for it to be in my hands: “safe find, fast find,” as they say, and if somethin’ comes out about it, then I could always turn it in.’ Well, of course, he’s spinning an old wives’ tale, lying like a dog, because I know this Dushkin. He’s a pawnbroker himself and is hiding stolen property. He didn’t filch this thirty-ruble item from Mikolai just to ‘turn it in.’ He simply lost his nerve. Well, to hell with it, you hear. Dushkin continues: ‘I know this here peasant Mikolai Dementev from his childhood; he’s from our district and province, Zaraysk, and I’m from Ryazan. And though Mikolai isn’t a drunkard, he does drink, and I knew he was workin’ in this here house, paintin’, together with Mitrei, and they’re both from the same place. After he gets the ruble, he changes it for some coins right away, downs two glasses of vodka, takes his change, leaves, but I didn’t see Mitrei with him at that time. The next day we hear that Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna had been killed with an axe. We knew them, sir, and I begin worryin’ about them earrin’s because we knew that the dead woman lent money for pledges. I went to see them in that house and began askin’ questions, carefully and quietly. The very first one I asked was ‘Is Mikolai here?’ Mitrei told me that Mikolai’d gone off on a spree, had come home drunk at dawn, stayed for about ten minutes, and then left again. Mitrei hadn’t seen him since and was finishin’ up the work alone. They were workin’ on the second floor of the same staircase as the deceased. After hearin’ all this, I didn’t say nothing to nobody at the time’—that’s Dushkin speaking—‘but I found out everythin’ I could about the murder and went back home with the same worries. This mornin’, at eight o’clock’—that is, on the third day, you understand—‘I see that Mikolai’s comin’ to see me, not sober, but not really dead drunk, so he could still understand conversation. He sits down on the bench and keeps silent. Besides him in the tavern at that time there was only one stranger, another man was asleep on the bench whom I knew, and my two boys. “Did you,” I ask, “see Mitrei?” “No,” he says, “I didn’t.” “And he wasn’t here?” “No,” he says, “not in the last two days.” “Where did he sleep last night?” “In the Sands,”† he says, “near Kolomna.” “And where,” I say, “did you get those earrings?” “I found ’em in the street,” and he says this with some uncertainty, without looking at me. “Have you heard,” I ask, “that such and such happened at that same time on that very evening on that staircase?” “No,” he says, “I didn’t.” He listens to me, his eyes wide open, and suddenly grows pale as a ghost. As I’m telling him all this, I see him reach for his cap and get ready to bolt. I wanted to keep him there; “Wait, Mikolai,” I say, “won’t you drink up?” I winked to my lad so he’d keep the door closed, and I came out from behind the counter; but he got away from me, ran out onto the street, down the lane—and that’s the last I saw of him. That settled all my doubts; he’s the culprit, no doubt about it . . .’ ”","‘Yes, of course! Well, here’s the story. Just two days after the murder, in the morning, while they were still fussing over Koch and Pestryakov—although the pair of them had proved every step they had taken, the truth was crying out to be heard—a most unexpected fact came out. There was a peasant called Dushkin, who owns a drinking shop opposite the house, he turned up at the police office with a pair of silver earrings in a jewel case, and he had a whole tale to tell. “He ran in to my place day before yesterday evening, just after eight or so,”—note the day and time!—“this workman Mikolay, a house painter, who’d been round to see me earlier that day, and he brought this here box with gold earrings and little stones, and asked me to lend him two roubles against them, and when I asked him where he got them, he said he’d picked them up off the pavement. I didn’t ask him any more about that,”—this is Dushkin speaking—“but I got out a note for him , I mean a rouble, thinking that if I didn’t take the stuff and lend him the money someone else would, there’s no difference— he’ll drink the money away, and it’s better if I hold on to the stuff: safe bind, safe find; and if anything comes up, or if there’s any talk about it, I’ll hand it in.” Well, naturally he dreamed all that up, he lies like a trooper , I know this Dushkin, he’s a pawnbroker and a fence himself, and when he got that thirty roubles’ worth of stuff off Mikolay, it wasn’t to “hand it in” at all, but then he just took fright. Anyway, never mind about that; so listen, then Dushkin says: “And I’ve known that there peasant Mikolay Dementyev since we was kids, he’s from the same province and district as me, Zaraysk, we both come from around Ryazan. * And though Mikolay’s not a drunk, he does like a drop, and I knew he was working in that there same house, painting it, along with Mitry, and him and Mitry, they come from the same place. And once he’d got my note, he changed it right away, drank off two glasses at a go, took the change and left, and I didn’t see Mitry with him just then. And next day I heard that Aliona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna was killed with an axe; now I used to know them, and I wondered what to do about them earrings, because I knew that the dead lady used to lend people money against their things. So I went to the house and began quietly finding out, treading carefully, and the very first thing I asked was, is Mikolay here? And Mitry told me that Mikolay had gone out on a bender, and come home drunk at daybreak, and didn’t stop at home more than ten minutes but went out again, and Mitry never saw him again, and was finishing off the job on his own. Their job’s on the same staircase as the murdered women, on the second floor. When I hear all that, I says nothing to no one” (this is Dushkin speaking), “but I nose out all I can about the murder and then I goes home, still wondering what to do. And this morning at eight”—so this is the third day, right?—“I see Mikolay coming in to my place, not sober but not all that drunk, he could understand what you said to him. He sat down on a bench and didn’t say anything. And the only people in the shop just then were one stranger; and someone else asleep on a bench, a fellow I knew; and a couple of our lads. ‘You seen Mitry?’ I ask him. ‘ No,’ says he, ‘I haven’t. ’—‘And have you been here?’—‘Not since the day before yesterday,’ he says. ‘So where did you spend last night?’—‘On the Sands, with Kolomna folk. ’*—‘And where did you get them earrings?’ ‘Found them on the pavement,’ he says, avoiding my eye, looking as if he didn’t expect me to believe him. ‘Did you hear about all that happened, up that staircase, that same evening at the same time?’—‘No,’ says he, ‘ I didn’t’—and he stands there listening to me, his eyes popping out, and all of a sudden he goes as white as chalk. There I am, telling him everything, and I see him grabbing his cap and getting up. I wanted to stop him, ‘Wait a minute, Mikolay,’ I says to him, ‘won’t you have a drink?’ And I tips my boy the wink to hold the door fast, and I comes out from behind the bar, and he dashes away from me, out onto the street, and races off, disappears into an alleyway, and that’s the last I see of him. So then I stops wondering what to do, because he’s the culprit, right enough…” ’","“Oh, yes! Well, here’s the story. Early on the third day after the murder, when they were still dangling Koch and Pestriakov—though they accounted for every step they took and it was absolutely obvious—an unexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a liquor store facing the house, brought a jeweler’s case containing some gold earrings to the police office, and told them a long story. ‘The day before yesterday, just after eight o’clock’—remember the day and the time!—‘a traveling house-painter, Nikolai, who had been in to see me already that day, brought me this box of gold earrings and stones, and asked me to give him two rubles for them. When I asked him where he got them, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him anything more.’ I am telling you Dushkin’s story. ‘I gave him a note’—a ruble , he meant—‘for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would with someone else. It would all come to the same thing—he’d spend it on drink, so it had better be with me. The further you hide it the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any rumors, I’ll take it to the police.’ Of course, that’s all nonsense; I know this Dushkin, he lies like a horse, he’s a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolai out of a thirty-ruble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was just afraid. But anyway, back to Dushkin’s story. ‘I’ve known this peasant, Nikolai Dementiev, since he was a child; he comes from the same province and district of Zaraisk, we are both Ryazan men. And though Nikolai isn’t a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that house, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village too. As soon as he got the ruble he spent it, had a couple of glasses, took his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then. And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Aliona Ivanovna and her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I felt suspicious about the earrings at once, because I knew the murdered woman lent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make careful inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, “Is Nikolai here?” Dmitri told me that Nikolai had gone off on a binge; he had come home at dawn drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes and went out again. Dmitri didn’t see him again and is still finishing the job alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on the second floor. When I heard all that I didn’t say a word to anyone’—that’s Dushkin ’s tale—‘but I found out what I could about the murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight o’clock this morning’—that was the third day, you understand—‘I saw Nikolai coming in, not sober, though not that drunk —he could understand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and didn’t speak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep on a bench and our two boys. “Have you seen Dmitri?” I said. “No, I haven’t,” he said. “And you’ve not been here either?” “Not since the day before yesterday,” he said. “And where did you sleep last night?” “In Peski, with the Kolomensky men.” “And where did you get those earrings?” I asked. “I found them in the street,” and the way he said it was a little strange; he didn’t look at me. “Did you hear what happened that very evening, that very hour, on that same staircase?” I said. “No,” he said, “I didn’t,” and all the while he was listening, his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted to keep him. “Wait a bit, Nikolai,” said I, “won’t you have a drink?” And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the bar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run. I haven’t seen him since. Then my doubts were over—he did it, as clear as could be . . . ’ ”"

"Лестница была узенькая, крутая и вся в помоях. Все кухни всех квартир во всех четырех этажах отворялись на эту лестницу и стояли так почти целый день. Оттого была страшная духота. Вверх и вниз всходили и сходили дворники с книжками под мышкой, хожалые[19] и разный люд обоего пола – посетители. Дверь в самую контору была тоже настежь отворена. Он вошел и остановился в прихожей. Тут всё стояли и ждали какие-то мужики. Здесь тоже духота была чрезвычайная и, кроме того, до тошноты било в нос свежею, еще не выстоявшеюся краской на тухлой олифе вновь покрашенных комнат. Переждав немного, он рассудил подвинуться еще вперед, в следующую комнату. Всё крошечные и низенькие были комнаты. Страшное нетерпение тянуло его все дальше и дальше. Никто не замечал его. Во второй комнате сидели и писали какие-то писцы, одетые разве немного его получше, на вид все странный какой-то народ.

He entered and stood in the hallway. Here everyone stood and waited for some men. Here, too, the stuffiness was extreme and, moreover, the fresh paint that had not yet stood on the rotten drying oil of the newly painted rooms was beating up to nausea. After waiting a little, he decided to move still forward into the next room. The rooms were all tiny and low. Terrible impatience drew him further and further. Nobody noticed him. In the second room, some scribes were sitting and writing, dressed perhaps a little better than him, they all looked like strange people.

All the rooms were small and low-ceilinged. A terrible impatience drew him on and on. No-one paid attention to him. In the second room some clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was—a rather strange-looking set. He went up to one of them."

"– Ну, брат, если действительно это серьезно, то… Ты, конечно, прав, говоря, что это не ново и похоже на все, что мы тысячу раз читали и слышали; но что действительно оригинально во всем этом, – и действительно принадлежит одному тебе, к моему ужасу, – это то, что все-таки кровь по совести разрешаешь, и, извини меня, с таким фанатизмом даже… В этом, стало быть, и главная мысль твоей статьи заключается. Ведь это разрешение крови по совести, это… это, по-моему, страшнее, чем бы официальное разрешение кровь проливать, законное…","“Well, brother, if this is really serious, then… Of course, you are right in saying that this is not new and is similar to everything that we have read and heard a thousand times; but what is really original in all this - and really belongs only to you, to my horror - is that you still allow blood in conscience, and, excuse me, even with such fanaticism ... This, therefore, is the main the point of your article is. After all, this is the permission of blood according to conscience, this ... this, in my opinion, is more terrible than official permission to shed blood, legal ...","“Well, my friend, if this really is so serious, then. . . . Of course, you’re right that none of it’s new and it all resembles everything we’ve read and heard a thousand times before. But what’s really original in all this—and belongs exclusively to you, to my chagrin—is the fact that you sanction bloodshed as a matter of conscience and, excuse me for saying so, even with such fanaticism. . . .

"Вин во множественном числе и многоразличных сортов не было, мадеры тоже: это было преувеличено, но вино было. Были водка, ром и лиссабонское, всё сквернейшего качества, но всего в достаточном количестве. Из яств, кроме кутьи, было три-четыре блюда (между прочим, и блины), всё с кухни Амалии Ивановны, да сверх того ставились разом два самовара для предполагавшихся после обеда чаю и пуншу. Закупками распорядилась сама Катерина Ивановна с помощию одного жильца, какого-то жалкого полячка, бог знает для чего проживавшего у г-жи Липпевехзель, который тотчас же прикомандировался на посылки к Катерине Ивановне и бегал весь вчерашний день и все это утро сломя голову и высунув язык, кажется особенно стараясь, чтобы заметно было это последнее обстоятельство. За каждыми пустяками он поминутно прибегал к самой Катерине Ивановне, бегал даже отыскивать ее в Гостиный двор, называл ее беспрестанно: «пани хорунжина», и надоел ей, наконец, как редька, хотя сначала она и говорила, что без этого «услужливого и великодушного» человека она бы совсем пропала. В свойстве характера Катерины Ивановны было поскорее нарядить первого встречного и поперечного в самые лучшие и яркие краски, захвалить его так, что иному становилось даже совестно, придумать в его хвалу разные обстоятельства, которые совсем и не существовали, совершенно искренно и чистосердечно поверить самой в их действительность и потом вдруг, разом, разочароваться, оборвать, оплевать и выгнать в толчки человека, которому она, только еще несколько часов назад, буквально поклонялась. От природы была она характера смешливого, веселого и миролюбивого, но от беспрерывных несчастий и неудач она до того яростно стала желать и требовать, чтобы все жили в мире и радости и не смели жить иначе, что самый легкий диссонанс в жизни, самая малейшая неудача стали приводить ее тотчас же чуть не в исступление, и она в один миг, после самых ярких надежд и фантазий, начинала клясть судьбу, рвать и метать все, что ни попадало под руку, и колотиться головой об стену. Амалия Ивановна тоже вдруг приобрела почему-то необыкновенное значение и необыкновенное уважение от Катерины Ивановны, единственно потому, может быть, что затеялись эти поминки и что Амалия Ивановна всем сердцем решилась участвовать во всех хлопотах: она взялась накрыть стол, доставить белье, посуду и проч. и приготовить на своей кухне кушанье. Ее уполномочила во всем и оставила по себе Катерина Ивановна, сама отправляясь на кладбище. Действительно, все было приготовлено на славу: стол был накрыт даже довольно чисто, посуда, вилки, ножи, рюмки, стаканы, чашки, все это, конечно, было сборное, разнофасонное и разнокалиберное, от разных жильцов, но все было к известному часу на своем месте, и Амалия Ивановна, чувствуя, что отлично исполнила дело, встретила возвратившихся даже с некоторою гордостию, вся разодетая, в чепце с новыми траурными лентами и в черном платье. Эта гордость, хотя и заслуженная, не понравилась почему-то Катерине Ивановне: «в самом деле, точно без Амалии Ивановны и стола бы не сумели накрыть!» Не понравился ей тоже и чепец с новыми лентами: «уж не гордится ли, чего доброго, эта глупая немка тем, что она хозяйка и из милости согласилась помочь бедным жильцам? Из милости! Прошу покорно! У папеньки Катерины Ивановны, который был полковник и чуть-чуть не губернатор, стол накрывался иной раз на сорок персон, так что какую-нибудь Амалию Ивановну, или, лучше сказать, Людвиговну, туда и на кухню бы не пустили…» Впрочем, Катерина Ивановна положила до времени не высказывать своих чувств, хотя и решила в своем сердце, что Амалию Ивановну непременно надо будет сегодня же осадить и напомнить ей ее настоящее место, а то она бог знает что об себе замечтает, покамест же обошлась с ней только холодно. Другая неприятность тоже отчасти способствовала раздражению Катерины Ивановны: на похоронах из жильцов, званных на похороны, кроме полячка, который успел-таки забежать и на кладбище, никто почти не был; к поминкам же, то есть к закуске, явились из них всё самые незначительные и бедные, многие из них не в своем даже виде, так, дрянь какая-то. Которые же из них постарше и посолиднее, те все, как нарочно, будто сговорившись, манкировали. Петр Петрович Лужин, например, самый, можно сказать, солиднейший из всех жильцов, не явился, а между тем еще вчера же вечером Катерина Ивановна уже успела наговорить всем на свете, то есть Амалии Ивановне, Полечке, Соне и полячку, что это благороднейший, великодушнейший человек, с огромнейшими связями и с состоянием, бывший друг ее первого мужа, принятый в доме ее отца и который обещал употребить все средства, чтобы выхлопотать ей значительный пенсион. Заметим здесь, что если Катерина Ивановна и хвалилась чьими-нибудь связями и состоянием, то это без всякого интереса, безо всякого личного расчета, совершенно бескорыстно, так сказать, от полноты сердца, из одного только удовольствия восхвалить и придать еще более цены хвалимому. За Лужиным и, вероятно, «беря с него пример», не явился и «этот скверный мерзавец Лебезятников». «Уж этот-то что об себе думает? Его только из милости пригласили, и то потому, что он с Петром Петровичем в одной комнате стоит и знакомый его, так неловко было не пригласить». Не явилась тоже и одна тонная дама с своею «перезрелою девой», дочерью, которые хотя и проживали всего только недели с две в нумерах у Амалии Ивановны, но несколько уже раз жаловались на шум и крик, подымавшийся из комнаты Мармеладовых, особенно когда покойник возвращался пьяный домой, о чем, конечно, стало уже известно Катерине Ивановне, через Амалию же Ивановну, когда та, бранясь с Катериной Ивановной и грозясь прогнать всю семью, кричала во все горло, что они беспокоят «благородных жильцов, которых ноги не стоят». Катерина Ивановна нарочно положила теперь пригласить эту даму и ее дочь, которых «ноги она будто бы не стоила», тем более что до сих пор, при случайных встречах, та высокомерно отвертывалась, – так вот, чтобы знала же она, что здесь «благороднее мыслят и чувствуют и приглашают, не помня зла», и чтобы видели они, что Катерина Ивановна и не в такой доле привыкла жить. Об этом непременно предполагалось им объяснить за столом, равно как и о губернаторстве покойного папеньки, а вместе с тем косвенно заметить, что нечего было при встречах отворачиваться и что это было чрезвычайно глупо. Не пришел тоже и толстый подполковник (в сущности, отставной штабс-капитан), но оказалось, что он «без задних ног» еще со вчерашнего утра. Одним словом, явились только: полячок, потом один плюгавенький канцелярист без речей, в засаленном фраке, в угрях и с противным запахом; потом еще один глухой и почти совсем слепой старичок, когда-то служивший в каком-то почтамте и которого кто-то с незапамятных времен и неизвестно для чего содержал у Амалии Ивановны. Явился тоже один пьяный отставной поручик, в сущности провиантский чиновник,[63] с самым неприличным и громким хохотом и, «представьте себе», без жилета! Один какой-то сел прямо за стол, даже не поклонившись Катерине Ивановне, и, наконец, одна личность, за неимением платья, явилась было в халате, но уж это было до такой степени неприлично, что стараниями Амалии Ивановны и полячка успели-таки его вывести. Полячок, впрочем, привел с собою еще каких-то двух других полячков, которые вовсе никогда и не жили у Амалии Ивановны и которых никто до сих пор в нумерах не видал. Все это чрезвычайно неприятно раздражило Катерину Ивановну. «Для кого же после этого делались все приготовления?» Даже детей, чтобы выгадать место, посадили не за стол, и без того занявший всю комнату, а накрыли им в заднем углу на сундуке, причем обоих маленьких усадили на скамейку, а Полечка, как большая, должна была за ними присматривать, кормить их и утирать им, «как благородным детям», носики. Одним словом, Катерина Ивановна поневоле должна была встретить всех с удвоенною важностью и даже с высокомерием. Особенно строго оглядела она некоторых и свысока пригласила сесть за стол. Считая почему-то, что за всех неявившихся должна быть в ответе Амалия Ивановна, она вдруг стала обращаться с ней до крайности небрежно, что та немедленно заметила и до крайности была этим пикирована. Такое начало не предвещало хорошего конца. Наконец, уселись.","There were no plural wines and many different varieties, Madeira too: it was exaggerated, but there was wine. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon, all of the worst quality, but just enough. Of the dishes, besides kutya, there were three or four dishes (including pancakes, by the way), all from the kitchen of Amalia Ivanovna, and in addition, two samovars were set up at once for tea and punch that were supposed to be after dinner. Katerina Ivanovna herself disposed of the purchases with the help of one tenant, some miserable Pole, God knows why, who lived with Madame Lippewechsel, who immediately seconded himself to send parcels to Katerina Ivanovna and ran around all yesterday and all this morning headlong and sticking out his tongue , seems to be especially trying to make this last circumstance noticeable. For every trifle, he would run to Katerina Ivanovna herself every minute, even run to look for her in the Gostiny Dvor, call her incessantly: ""Mistress Khorunzhina"", and finally tired her like a radish, although at first she said that without this ""helpful and generous » of a person, she would be completely gone. It was in the nature of Katerina Ivanovna’s character to quickly dress up the first person she met and cross in the best and brightest colors, to praise him in such a way that another felt even ashamed, to invent various circumstances in his praise that did not exist at all, to believe herself in their own reality and then suddenly, all at once, to be disappointed, cut off, spit on and kick out the man whom she, only a few hours ago, literally worshiped. By nature, she had a humorous, cheerful and peaceful character, but from incessant misfortunes and failures, she so fiercely began to desire and demand that everyone live in peace and joy and not dare to live otherwise, that the slightest dissonance in life, the slightest failure became drive her immediately almost into a frenzy, and in an instant, after the brightest hopes and fantasies, she began to curse fate, tear and throw everything that came to hand, and bang her head against the wall. Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired, for some reason, an extraordinary importance and extraordinary respect from Katerina Ivanovna, perhaps only because this commemoration was started and that Amalia Ivanovna decided with all her heart to participate in all the troubles: she undertook to set the table, deliver linen, dishes, etc. . and cook food in your kitchen. She was authorized in everything and left by Katerina Ivanovna, herself going to the cemetery. Indeed, everything was cooked to perfection: the table was even set quite cleanly, dishes, forks, knives, glasses, glasses, cups, all this, of course, was prefabricated, of various styles and sizes, from different tenants, but everything was at a certain hour on in her place, and Amalia Ivanovna, feeling that she had done an excellent job, greeted the returnees even with a certain pride, all dressed up, in a cap with new mourning ribbons and in a black dress. This pride, although well-deserved, did not please Katerina Ivanovna for some reason: “indeed, it was as if without Amalia Ivanovna they would not have been able to set the table!” She also did not like the cap with new ribbons: “Isn’t this stupid German woman proud of the fact that she is the hostess and, out of mercy, agreed to help the poor tenants? Out of mercy! I humbly ask! At papa Katerina Ivanovna, who was a colonel and almost a governor, the table was set sometimes for forty people, so that some Amalia Ivanovna, or, rather, Ludwigovna, would not be allowed in there and into the kitchen ... ""However, Katerina Ivanovna made up her mind not to express her feelings for the time being, although she decided in her heart that Amalia Ivanovna would certainly have to be put down that very day and reminded her of her real place, otherwise she would, God knows what, dream of herself, but for the time being treated her only coldly. Another unpleasantness also partly contributed to the irritation of Katerina Ivanovna: at the funeral, from the residents invited to the funeral, except for the Pole, who managed to run into the cemetery, almost no one was; to the wake, that is, to the snack, all the most insignificant and poor of them appeared, many of them not even in their form, so, some kind of rubbish. Which of them are older and more impressive, they all, as if on purpose, as if by agreement, skimped. Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, for example, the most, one might say, the most respectable of all the tenants, did not appear, and yet yesterday evening Katerina Ivanovna had already managed to tell everyone in the world, that is, Amalia Ivanovna, Polechka, Sonya and the Pole, that this is the noblest, a most generous man, with the greatest connections and fortune, a former friend of her first husband, adopted in her father's house and who promised to use all means to secure her a considerable pension. Let us note here that if Katerina Ivanovna even boasted of someone's connections and fortune, then it was without any interest, without any personal calculation, completely disinterested, so to speak, from the fullness of her heart, out of sheer pleasure to praise and give even more value to the praised. Behind Luzhin, and probably ""taking an example from him"", ""that nasty bastard Lebezyatnikov"" did not appear either. “What does this one think of himself? He was invited only out of mercy, and because he was in the same room with Pyotr Petrovich and knew him, it was so embarrassing not to invite. Also, one ton lady with her “overripe maiden”, her daughter, did not appear either, who, although they lived only a week or two in the rooms of Amalia Ivanovna, had already complained several times about the noise and screaming rising from the Marmeladovs’ room, especially when the deceased returned drunk home, which, of course, Katerina Ivanovna had already become aware of, through Amalia Ivanovna, when she, quarreling with Katerina Ivanovna and threatening to drive the whole family away, shouted at the top of her lungs that they were disturbing ""noble tenants whose legs cannot stand."" Katerina Ivanovna now deliberately decided to invite this lady and her daughter, whom ""she seemed not to be worth a leg"", all the more so since until now, at chance meetings, she arrogantly turned away - so that she knew that it was ""more noble"" here. they think and feel and invite, not remembering evil, ”and so that they see that Katerina Ivanovna is not used to living in such a share. This was certainly supposed to be explained to them at the table, as well as about the governorship of the late papa, and at the same time indirectly remark that there was nothing to turn away at meetings and that it was extremely stupid. Neither did the stout lieutenant colonel (actually a retired staff captain), but it turned out that he had been ""without hind legs"" since yesterday morning. In a word, there were only: a Pole, then one shabby clerk without speeches, in a greasy tailcoat, in blackheads and with a nasty smell; then another deaf and almost completely blind old man who had once worked in some post office and whom someone from time immemorial and for some unknown reason kept with Amalia Ivanovna. A drunken retired lieutenant also appeared, in essence a clerk of provisions,[63] with the most indecent and loud laughter and, ""imagine"", without a waistcoat! One of them sat down right at the table without even bowing to Katerina Ivanovna, and finally, one person, for lack of a dress, appeared in a dressing gown, but this was so indecent that, thanks to the efforts of Amalia Ivanovna, the Pole managed to do it. withdraw. The Pole, however, brought with him some two other Poles who had never lived at Amalia Ivanovna's at all and whom no one had ever seen in the rooms until now. All this irritated Katerina Ivanovna extremely unpleasantly. “For whom, then, were all the preparations made?” Even the children, in order to gain a place, were not seated at the table, which already occupied the whole room, but they were covered with them in the back corner on the chest, and both little ones were seated on a bench, and Polechka, as a big one, had to look after them, feed them and wipe their noses “like noble children”. In a word, Katerina Ivanovna involuntarily had to greet everyone with redoubled importance and even with arrogance. She looked especially sternly at some of them and, condescendingly, invited them to sit down at the table. Considering for some reason that Amalia Ivanovna should be responsible for all those who did not appear, she suddenly began to treat her extremely carelessly, which she immediately noticed and was extremely dived by this. Such a beginning did not portend a good ending. Finally, they sat down.","There wasn’t a great deal of wine or an array of different kinds, nor was there any Madeira: that was an exaggeration; but there was some wine. There was vodka, rum, and Lisbon wine, all of very poor quality, but all in sufficient quantity. As for the food, besides the traditional kutya,* there were three or four dishes (including pancakes, incidentally), all from Amaliya Ivanovna’s kitchen; in addition, two samovars were brought in to provide tea and punch after the meal. Katerina Ivanovna had provided the purchases herself, with the help of one lodger, some pitiful Pole, who was living at Madame Lippevekhsel’s for some reason or other, and who’d immediately volunteered to assist Katerina Ivanovna with her errands, and had run around all the day before, and had raced around all that morning with his tongue hanging out, apparently hoping that this activity would be noticed by everyone. He kept running constantly to Katerina Ivanovna herself for every little thing, even searching for her at the shopping arcade, persistently calling her “Madame Ensign.” She finally grew so sick and tired of him, even though at first she would say that she would have been completely lost had it not been for this “obliging and generous” man. It was characteristic of Katerina Ivanovna to paint everybody and anybody she met in the best and brightest colors, to praise him such that others felt embarrassed, to conceive of various circumstances on their behalf that had never existed, to believe completely sincerely and wholeheartedly in their existence, and then all at once, suddenly, to be disillusioned, break off with them, humiliate them, and banish the person she had literally worshipped only a few hours ago. By nature she had a humorous, cheerful, and peace-loving character, but as a result of continual misfortunes and failures, she had begun furiously to desire and demand that everyone live in peace and joy and that they dare not live otherwise, that the least dissonance in life, the smallest failure, would drive her immediately into a frenzy, and in one moment, after the brightest aspirations and fantasies, she would begin to curse fate, tearing and smashing anything that came to hand and banging her head against the wall. Amaliya Ivanovna, for some reason, had also suddenly acquired unusual importance and unusual respect from Katerina Ivanovna, perhaps solely because the funeral feast was being prepared and Amaliya Ivanovna had resolved with all her heart to take part in all the work: she took it upon herself to set the table, procure the linen, crockery, and so forth, and to prepare the food in her kitchen. Katerina Ivanovna entrusted everything to her and left her alone, while she herself set off for the cemetery. As a matter of fact, everything had been wonderfully prepared: the table was set even rather elegantly; the dishes, forks, knives, goblets, glasses, cups—everything, of course, had been collected from various lodgers and didn’t match in style or quality, but everything was in place by the appointed time. Amaliya Ivanovna, feeling that she had accomplished her task extremely well, even greeted those returning with a certain pride; she had changed her clothes and was wearing a black dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons. For some reason, Katerina Ivanovna didn’t appreciate her pride, even though it was well deserved: “As if no one else knows how to set a table except for Amaliya Ivanovna!” And she also didn’t like her cap with the new ribbons: “Isn’t this stupid German woman taking pride in the fact that she’s the landlady and has agreed to help some poor lodgers out of charity? Out of charity! I ask you, really! At the house of Katerina Ivanovna’s papa, who was a colonel and had almost become a governor, the table was sometimes set for forty guests; someone like Amaliya Ivanovna—or, rather, Amaliya Lyudvigovna—wouldn’t even be allowed in the kitchen . . .” However, Katerina Ivanovna decided not to vent her feelings for the time being, although she resolved in her heart to put her in her place and remind her of who she really was, or else God knows what she might start thinking of herself; meanwhile, she merely treated her with coldness. Another unpleasant circumstance furthered Katerina Ivanovna’s irritation: at the funeral, almost no one, not one of the lodgers who had been invited, showed up, except for the little Pole, who even managed to make it to the cemetery; but at the wake—that is, for the refreshments—the most insignificant and poorest of them appeared, many of them even already intoxicated, the wretched good-for-nothings. But the older and more respectable of them absented themselves, as if on purpose, as if they had agreed in advance to skip the event. Petr Petrovich Luzhin, for example, perhaps the most respectable of all the lodgers, did not attend; meanwhile, yesterday evening Katerina Ivanovna had managed to tell everyone on earth—that is, Amaliya Ivanovna, Polechka, Sonya, and the little Pole—that this most respectable and most generous man, with his vast number of connections and his wealth, her first husband’s former friend, someone who had been received in her father’s house and who had promised to use all possible means to procure a considerable pension for her, this same Luzhin did not appear. We’ll observe here that if Katerina Ivanovna bragged about anyone’s connections and wealth, it was without any self-interest, without any personal calculation, but was completely innocent, so to speak, out of the fullness of her heart, the sheer pleasure of bestowing praise and conferring more value to the person being praised. Like Luzhin and, probably, “following his example,” “that nasty scoundrel Lebezyatnikov” had also failed to show up. “Just who does he think he is? He was invited only out of kindness, and only because he shares a room with Petr Petrovich and is his acquaintance, so that it would have been awkward not to include him.” A fashionable lady with her “overripe spinster” of a daughter also failed to appear; they had resided at Amaliya Ivanovna’s rooms for only about two weeks, but had several times complained about the noise and shouts coming from the Marmeladovs’, especially when the recently deceased arrived home drunk, about which Katerina Ivanovna had been informed by Amaliya Ivanovna, when she was quarreling with her and threatening to throw the whole family out; she was screaming at the top of her lungs that they were disturbing her “respectable lodgers, whose shoelaces she was unfit to tie.” Katerina Ivanovna made a point of intentionally inviting this lady and her daughter, whose “shoelaces she was unfit to tie,” all the more so since up to then in any incidental meeting, the lady would haughtily turn her face away—so that this lady would know that here “respectable people have thoughts and feelings, and invite others without holding a grudge,” and so that she would see that Katerina Ivanovna was not used to living in such circumstances. She definitely intended to make this clear to them at the table, as well as making the point about her late papa’s near governorship and, at the same time, hinting indirectly that there was no reason for her to turn away when meeting them and that such behavior was extremely foolish. The fat lieutenant colonel (in reality, a retired second lieutenant) also didn’t attend, but it turned out that he had been “dead tired” since yesterday morning. In a word, the only people who came were: the little Pole, a shabby, silent pimply clerk in a soiled jacket who had a nasty smell; and also a deaf and almost blind little old man who at one time had served in a post office; he was a man someone had been supporting at Amaliya Ivanovna’s for ages and for unknown reasons. There was also a retired drunken lieutenant, in fact a quartermaster, with the most unpleasant loud laugh and, “just imagine,” who came without a vest! One of them sat right down at the table without even greeting Katerina Ivanovna. At length, one person was about to appear in his dressing gown because he didn’t own a suit, but this was so inappropriate that the combined efforts of Amaliya Ivanovna and the little Pole succeeded in excluding him. The little Pole brought with him two other Poles who had never resided at Amaliya Ivanovna’s, and whom no one had seen before in these rooms. All of this irritated Katerina Ivanovna in an extremely unpleasant manner. “After all, who were all these preparations made for?” Even the children, to save space, were not seated at the main table, which already occupied the entire room. Their places had been set on a trunk in the far corner; the two little ones were placed on a bench, and Polechka, as the biggest, was supposed to mind them, feed them, and wipe their noses “like respectable children.” In a word, Katerina Ivanovna was obligated against her will to greet everyone with redoubled dignity, even with haughtiness. She regarded several of the guests with particular sternness and condescendingly invited them to sit down at the table. Having decided for some reason that Amaliya Ivanovna was responsible for those who didn’t appear, she suddenly began to address her with excessive rudeness, which Amaliya Ivanovna noticed immediately, becoming extremely piqued. Such a beginning did not bode well for a good ending. At last everyone was seated.","There was no great quantity or variety of wines and spirits there, nor was there any madeira; that had been an exaggeration. But there were alcoholic drinks. There was vodka, and rum, and port, all of the poorest quality, but all in adequate amounts. Apart from the kutya,* there were three or four kinds of food (incidentally including pancakes), all from Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen, and in addition there were two samovars going at the same time, for the tea and punch to be served after dinner. Katerina Ivanovna had seen to all the shopping herself, with the help of one of the lodgers, a pathetic little Pole living at Madame Lippewechsel’s , heaven knows why; he had immediately volunteered his services to Katerina Ivanovna and had been running back and forth at a breakneck pace all the previous day and all this morning, with his tongue hanging out—and apparently trying his hardest to make sure that everyone observed this last fact. He sought out Katerina Ivanovna in person for all his trivial queries, even running to find her at Gostiny Dvor,* and constantly addressing her as ‘Madam Pani Lieutenant’. * Eventually she grew sick to death of him, although to start with she had said she would have been utterly lost without this ‘obliging and generous-hearted’ person. It was a trait of Katerina Ivanovna’s character that she would instantly paint anyone she met in the brightest and most flattering colours, praising them to the skies in terms that some even found embarrassing, inventing all sorts of stories to their credit that had never really happened, and believing sincerely and wholeheartedly that all of it was true; then she would suddenly become disillusioned, and rudely and contemptuously repulse the person she had been literally idolizing only a few hours earlier. By nature she was a humorous, cheerful, and peaceable woman, but her endless misfortunes and setbacks had made her long so passionately for everyone to live in peace and harmony together, and not dare to live otherwise, that the slightest discord in her life, the least upset, at once drove her into a frenzy, and from indulging the brightest of hopes and fantasies she would instantly fall to cursing fate, ripping up and throwing about whatever came to hand, and banging her head against the wall. Amalia Ivanovna, too, had suddenly come to impress Katerina Ivanovna as enormously important and worthy of extraordinary respect, perhaps just because of this funeral wake, and because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart and soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to set the table, provide table linen, cutlery and the rest, and prepare the food in her own kitchen. Katerina Ivanovna left everything to her, while she herself set off for the cemetery. And indeed, the preparations had been a triumph: the table was set quite neatly, with plates, forks, knives, small and large glasses and cups—everything borrowed from different lodgers, all in different sizes and patterns, but all set out ready by the appointed time. Amalia Ivanovna, feeling that she had acquitted herself very well, proudly welcomed the returning guests in all her finery, wearing a black dress and new mourning ribbons in her cap. This pride of hers, though well deserved, for some reason displeased Katerina Ivanovna—‘just think, as if but for Amalia Ivanovna we’d never have got the table laid!’ Nor did she approve of the cap with its new ribbons—‘can it be that that stupid German woman is actually proud because she’s the mistress of the house, and she’s consented to help her poor lodgers out of charity? Charity! I ask you! My Papa, who was a colonel and very nearly Governor, would sometimes have a table laid in his house for forty guests, and your Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, wouldn’t even have been allowed in his kitchen…’ However, Katerina Ivanovna had decided not to give vent to her feelings for the time being, although she had resolved in her heart that Amalia Ivanovna must be given a snub this very day and be put firmly in her place, or else she’d get heaven knows what ideas about herself. But meanwhile she just treated her coldly. And another unpleasant fact had contributed to Katerina Ivanovna’s annoyance: out of all the lodgers invited to attend the funeral, almost no one had turned up apart from the little Pole, who had just managed to run down to the cemetery; and yet all the most insignificant and impoverished lodgers had turned up to the wake, the meal that is—some of them not even sober; nothing but riff-raff in fact. The older and more solid lodgers seemed to have deliberately conspired to stay away. Piotr Petrovich Luzhin, for instance, perhaps the most solid of them all, hadn’t turned up, although only last night Katerina Ivanovna had made a point of telling anyone and everyone—that is, Amalia Ivanovna, Polechka, Sonia, and the little Pole—that he was a most noble and generous man, very well connected and possessed of a fortune, who had been a friend of her first husband, had been received in her father’s home, and had promised to do everything possible to procure her a substantial pension. It should be noted at this point that even if Katerina Ivanovna did boast of a person’s connections and fortune, that was completely disinterested and devoid of any ulterior motive, purely out of the altruistic fullness of her heart, for the simple pleasure of adding to the consequence of whatever individual she was praising to the skies. Luzhin wasn’t the only one who hadn’t turned up; ‘ that nasty wretch’ Lebeziatnikov, probably ‘following his lead’, had never appeared either. ‘Who does that man think he is anyway? He was only invited out of kindness, merely because he shares a room with Piotr Petrovich and is friendly with him, so it would have been awkward not to ask him.’ Another person who failed to turn up was a genteel lady with her ‘old maid of a daughter’, who although they had only lived in Amalia Ivanovna’s rooms for a few weeks, had several times already complained of the noise and shouting coming up from the Marmeladovs’ room, particularly when the late Marmeladov came home drunk; Katerina Ivanovna had of course found this out from Amalia Ivanovna herself, when that lady, in the midst of a quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna during which she had threatened to evict her whole family, had yelled at the top of her voice that they were upsetting the ‘respectable lodgers whose shoes they weren’t fit to wipe’. Now Katerina Ivanovna had made a point of inviting this lady and her daughter, whose shoes she supposedly ‘wasn’t fit to wipe’—and who, furthermore, had been haughtily turning her back on her if they ever happened to meet; just to let that woman know that ‘there were people here who were more high-minded and delicate, and would proffer an invitation without harbouring any hard feelings’, and show them that Katerina Ivanovna herself hadn’t been used to living like this. She was resolved to explain all this to them at table, and tell them how her late Papa had been a Governor, and obliquely hint at the same time that turning away when they met was both unnecessary and extraordinarily stupid. The fat lieutenant colonel (in fact a retired staff captain) hadn’t appeared either; but it turned out that he had been ‘laid up’ ever since the previous morning. In short, the only ones to turn up were the little Pole, a weedy little spotty-faced clerk in a greasy frock coat who smelt bad and never said a word, and a deaf and nearly blind old man who had once worked in some post office and whom someone had been supporting at Amalia Ivanovna’s since time immemorial, nobody knew why. And then there was a drunken retired lieutenant (in point of fact a supply clerk), with an offensively loud guffaw, and, ‘just imagine’, without a waistcoat! Another visitor had sat straight down at table without even bowing to Katerina Ivanovna; and finally, one person who didn’t even possess a decent outfit had tried to come along in his dressing gown; but that was so grossly improper that he was turned away by the combined exertions of Amalia Ivanovna and the little Pole. The little Pole, as a matter of fact, had brought along a couple of other little Poles as well, who had never even lived at Amalia Ivanovna’s and had never been seen in the house before. All this utterly exasperated Katerina Ivanovna. ‘If that’s how it’s turned out, then what was the use of going to all this trouble?’ To save space, even the children hadn’t been given places at the table, which anyway filled the whole room; instead, places had been laid for them on a trunk in the far corner, where the two little ones sat on a bench while Polechka, as their big sister, had to look after them, feed them, and wipe their noses ‘like well-brought-up children’. Katerina Ivanovna was obliged, whether she liked it or not, to welcome everyone with an even more ceremonious, not to say haughty, manner. She gave some of the guests a particularly stern look, as she loftily invited them to take their places at table. For some reason she regarded Amalia Ivanovna as responsible for all those who failed to appear, and suddenly began treating her in an extremely offhand way; which Amalia Ivanovna immediately observed, and took great offence. Such a beginning didn’t bode well for the ending. Eventually everyone was seated.","There was not a large selection of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine there was nevertheless. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity. Besides the traditional rice and honey, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of pancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen. Two samovars were boiling in order that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Katerina Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been stranded at Madame Lippewechsel’s. He promptly put himself at Katerina Ivanovna’s disposal and had been running around all day as fast as his legs could carry him, and was very anxious that everyone should be aware of it. For every minor problem he ran to Katerina Ivanovna, even hunting her out at the market, at every instant called her “Pani.” She was thoroughly sick of him before the end of it, though she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this “serviceable and magnanimous man.” It was one of Katerina Ivanovna’s characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colors. Her praises were so exaggerated as to be embarrassing on occasion; she would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance and quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden she would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the person she had been literally adoring only a few hours previously. She had a naturally merry, lively and peace-loving disposition, but due to her continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so keenly that everyone should live in peace and joy and should not dare to break the peace that the slightest problem, the smallest disaster reduced her almost to a frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and fancies to cursing her fate and raving and knocking her head against the wall. Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in Katerina Ivanovna’s eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary respect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart and soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table, to provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her kitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone off to the cemetery. Everything had been well done. Even the tablecloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses had been lent by different lodgers and were naturally of all shapes and patterns, but the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna, feeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some pride. This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for some reason: “as though the table could not have been laid except by Amalia Ivanovna!” She disliked the cap with its new ribbons, too. “Could she be so dismissive, the stupid German, because she was the mistress of the house and had agreed as a favor to help her poor tenants! As a favor! Imagine! Katerina Ivanovna’s father, who had been a colonel and almost a governor, had sometimes had the table set for forty people, and anyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been allowed into the kitchen.” Katerina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the time being and contented herself with treating her coldly, though she decided inwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down and set her in her place, for goodness only knew how highly she thought of herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that hardly any of the tenants whom she had invited had come to the funeral, except the Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned up, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober. The older and more respectable ones among them stayed away, as if by common consent. Peter Petrovich Luzhin, for instance, who could be described as the most respectable of all the tenants, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna had the evening before told the whole world, that is Amalia Ivanovna, Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous, noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had been a friend of her first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s house, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her a considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna praised anyone’s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior motive, entirely disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of increasing the importance of the person praised. Probably “taking his cue” from Luzhin, “that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up either. Why did he think so highly of himself? He was only invited out of kindness and because he was sharing the same room with Peter Petrovich and was a friend of his: it would have been awkward not to invite him.” Among those who failed to appear were “the genteel lady and her old-maidish daughter,” who had only been lodgers in the house for the last fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar in Katerina Ivanovna’s room, especially when Marmeladov had come back drunk. Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who, quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole family out of doors, had shouted at her that they “were not worth the foot” of the honorable lodgers whom they were disturbing. Katerina Ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, “whose foot she was not worth,” and who had turned away haughtily when she met them casually, so that they might know that “she was more noble in her thoughts and feelings and did not harbor malice,” and might see that she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed to make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father’s governorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was extremely stupid of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major (he was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it appeared that he had “not been himself ” for the last two days. The party consisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself and smelt abominably, and a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the post office and who had been maintained by someone at Amalia Ivanovna’s for as long as anyone could remember. A retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was drunk, had a loud and extremely indecent laugh and, just imagine—he came without a waistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down at the table without even greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Finally, one person with no suit on appeared in his dressing gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole brought with him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna’s and whom no-one had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina Ivanovna intensely. “For whom had they made all these preparations then?” To make room for the visitors the children had not even had places laid for them at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka, as the biggest girl, had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like well-bred children’s. Katerina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with increased dignity, and even arrogance. She stared at some of them with particular severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. Rushing to the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who were absent, she began treating her with extreme indifference, which the latter promptly observed and resented. Such a beginning was not a good omen for the end. All were seated at last."
"– Извините, сударь, – дрожа со злости, ответил Лужин, – в письме моем я распространился о ваших качествах и поступках единственно в исполнении тем самым просьбы вашей сестрицы и мамаши описать им: как я вас нашел и какое вы на меня произвели впечатление?

And as for the matter alluded to in my letter, pray find me a single line that is unjust—can you say that you did not waste the money, or that that family, unfortunate though it may be, does not contain unworthy persons?’","“Excuse me, sir,” said Luzhin, quivering with fury. “I enlarged upon your qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your sister’s and mother’s inquiries about how I found you and what impression you made on me. As for what you’ve referred to in my letter, be so good as to point out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn’t throw away your money, and that there are not worthless persons in that family, however unfortunate.”"

"Раскольников понимал отчасти, почему Соня не решалась ему читать, и чем более понимал это, тем как бы грубее и раздражительнее настаивал на чтении. Он слишком хорошо понимал, как тяжело было ей теперь выдавать и обличать все свое. Он понял, что чувства эти действительно как бы составляли настоящую и уже давнишнюю, может быть, тайну ее, может быть, еще с самого отрочества, еще в семье, подле несчастного отца и сумасшедшей от горя мачехи, среди голодных детей, безобразных криков и попреков. Но в то же время он узнал теперь, и узнал наверно, что хоть и тосковала она и боялась чего-то ужасно, принимаясь теперь читать, но что вместе с тем ей мучительно самой хотелось прочесть, несмотря на всю тоску и на все опасения, и именно ему, чтоб он слышал, и непременно теперь – « что бы там ни вышло потом!»… Он прочел это в ее глазах, понял из ее восторженного волнения… Она пересилила себя, подавила горловую спазму, пресекшую в начале стиха ее голос, и продолжала чтение одиннадцатой главы Евангелия Иоаннова. Так дочла она до 19-го стиха:","Raskolnikov partly understood why Sonya did not dare to read to him, and the more he understood this, the more rudely and irritably he insisted on reading. He understood only too well how hard it was now for her to betray and denounce everything that was hers. He realized that these feelings really, as it were, constituted a real and already long-standing, perhaps her secret, perhaps even from adolescence, still in the family, near the unfortunate father and stepmother, crazy with grief, among hungry children, ugly screams and reproaches . But at the same time, he now found out, and probably found out, that although she was sad and terribly afraid of something, now she began to read, but at the same time she painfully wanted to read it herself, despite all the anguish and all the fears, and to him, so that he would hear, and certainly now - “whatever happens next!” ... He read it in her eyes, understood from her enthusiastic excitement ... She overcame herself, suppressed a throat spasm that cut off her voice at the beginning of the verse, and continued reading the eleventh chapter of the Gospel of John. So she read until the 19th verse:","Raskolnikov understood in part why Sonya had refused to read to him, and the more he understood that, the more abusively and irritably he insisted on her reading. He understood all too well how painful it was for her to expose and betray all that was her own. He realized that these feelings seemed perhaps to constitute her genuine and cherished secret, perhaps from her own girlhood, when she was living with her family, with her unfortunate father and her stepmother, demented by grief, among hungry children, hideous cries, and reproaches. But at the same time, he now knew, and knew for certain, that even though she grieved and feared something terrible as she now set about reading, she also felt a tormenting desire to read, in spite of her grief and all the dangers, and to read just to him, so that he heard, and precisely now—“whatever happened afterward!” He could read this in her eyes, he could understand it in her emotional distress. . . . She gained control of herself, suppressed the throat spasms that had broken her voice at the beginning of the verse; then she continued reading the eleventh chapter of the Gospel of John. Thus she reached the nineteenth verse:","Raskolnikov partly understood why Sonia couldn’t bring herself to read to him, but the more he understood, the more roughly and irritably he insisted that she should. He could see all too well how hard it was for her now to expose and strip bare everything of her own. He realized that these feelings did indeed represent a real secret of hers, one that she had perhaps cherished for a long time, perhaps ever since she was a young girl, living with her family, alongside her wretched father and her stepmother crazed with grief, amongst the hungry children, the terrible shrieks and scolding. Yet at the same time he had now found out, and found out for certain, that although she had felt bad and terribly afraid when she began reading, at the same time she herself desperately wanted to read, despite all her bad feelings and fears: to read to him, for him to hear her, and to do it now—‘whatever happens later on!’… He had read that in her eyes, and understood it from her excited agitation… She mastered herself, overcame the spasm in her throat that had cut off her voice at the beginning of the verse, and went on reading the eleventh chapter of the Gospel of St John.","Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him and the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on her doing so.

But at the same time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read to him that he might hear it, and to read now whatever might come of it! . . . He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion. She mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth verse:"

"А каково! Даже Разумихин начал было подозревать! Сцена в коридоре, у лампы, прошла тогда не даром. Вот он бросился к Порфирию… Но с какой же стати этот-то стал его так надувать? Что у него за цель отводить глаза у Разумихина на Миколку? Ведь он непременно что-то задумал; тут есть намерения, но какие? Правда, с того утра прошло много времени, – слишком, слишком много, а о Порфирии не было ни слуху ни духу. Что ж, это, конечно, хуже…» Раскольников взял фуражку и, задумавшись, пошел из комнаты. Первый день, во все это время, он чувствовал себя, по крайней мере, в здравом сознании. «Надо кончить с Свидригайловым, – думал он, – и во что бы то ни стало, как можно скорей: этот тоже, кажется, ждет, чтоб я сам к нему пришел». И в это мгновение такая ненависть поднялась вдруг из его усталого сердца, что, может быть, он бы мог убить кого-нибудь из этих двух: Свидригайлова или Порфирия. По крайней мере, он почувствовал, что если не теперь, то впоследствии он в состоянии это сделать. «Посмотрим, посмотрим», – повторял он про себя.","And what! Even Razumikhin began to suspect! The scene in the corridor, by the lamp, was not in vain then. So he rushed to Porfiry ... But why on earth did this one begin to cheat him like that? What is his purpose in diverting Razumikhin's eyes to Mikolka? After all, he certainly thought of something; there are intentions, but what? True, a lot of time had passed since that morning—too much, too much—and there was not a word or a breath about Porfiry. Well, this, of course, is worse ... ”Raskolnikov took his cap and, thinking, went out of the room. The first day, during all this time, he felt at least sane. “We must put an end to Svidrigailov,” he thought, “and by all means, as soon as possible: this one, too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him myself.” And at that moment such hatred suddenly arose from his tired heart that perhaps he could have killed one of these two: Svidrigailov or Porfiry. At least he felt that if not now, then later he was able to do it. ""We'll see, we'll see,"" he repeated to himself.","“How do you like that! Even Razumikhin had begun to suspect him! The scene in the hall, near the lamp, hadn’t passed unnoticed. He had rushed off to see Porfiry. . . . But for what reason did Porfiry try to dupe him like that? Why was he trying to divert Razumikhin’s eyes to Mikolka? He must have had something in mind; there must have been some intention, but what? True, since that morning a great deal of time had elapsed, too much, much too much, and there had been no news at all about Porfiry. And, of course, that made things worse . . .” Raskolnikov took his cap; still deep in thought, he left his room. This was the first day, in all this time, that he himself felt in his right mind at least. “I must settle matters with Svidrigaylov,” he thought, “no matter what, as quickly as possible: he, too, seems to be waiting for me to come see him myself.” At that moment, such hatred suddenly arose from his weary heart that perhaps he could have even murdered one of the two of them: Svidrigaylov or Porfiry. He felt, at least, that if not now, he would be capable of doing it later. “We’ll see, we’ll see,” he repeated to himself.","Words had passed between them then, and movements, and gestures, and such looks had been exchanged, and things pronounced in such tones, and they had taken the matter to such a point, that after that no Mikolka (whom Porfiry had seen through, right from his very first word and gesture), no Mikolka was going to succeed in shaking the very foundations of what Porfiry firmly believed. Besides—even Razumikhin had almost begun to suspect! That scene in the corridor, by the lamp, had meant something too. And then he’d rushed off to Porfiry… But why ever had Porfiry started lying to him like that? What was his idea, throwing dust in Razumikhin’s eyes with his talk of Mikolka? He must certainly have been planning something; all of that had been deliberate, but why? True, a lot of time had passed since that morning—far, far too much time—without any further sight or sound of Porfiry. Well, of course, that was a bad sign… Raskolnikov picked up his cap and left the room, deep in thought. This was the first day for some time when he had at least felt normally rational. ‘I have to finish with Svidrigailov,’ he thought, ‘and as quickly as possible, whatever happens. I suppose he’s waiting for me to seek him out myself.’ And at that moment his exhausted heart suddenly overflowed with such hatred that he might even have been capable of murdering one or other of them—Svidrigailov or Porfiry. At the very least he felt that he’d be capable of doing it, if not now, then later on. ‘We shall see, we shall see,’ he repeated to himself.","“And to think that even Razumikhin had begun to suspect! The scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then. He had rushed to Porfiry . . . But what had induced the latter to receive him like that? What had been his aim in putting Razumikhin off with Nikolai? He must have some plan; there was some design, but what was it? It was true that a long time had passed since that morning—too long a time—and no sight or sound of Porfiry. Well, that was a bad sign . . . ” Raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still pondering. It was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind, at least. “I must settle Svidrigailov,” he thought, “and as soon as possible; he, too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own accord.” And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his weary heart that he might have killed either of those two—Porfiry or Svidrigailov. At least he felt that he would be capable of doing it later, if not now. “We shall see, we shall see,” he repeated to himself."

Ни до одной правды не добирались, не соврав наперед раз четырнадцать, а может, и сто четырнадцать, а это почетно в своем роде; ну, а мы и соврать-то своим умом не умеем! Ты мне ври, да ври по-своему, и я тебя тогда поцелую. Соврать по-своему – ведь это почти лучше, чем правда по одному по-чужому; в первом случае ты человек, а во втором ты только что птица! Правда не уйдет, а жизнь-то заколотить можно; примеры были. Ну, что мы теперь? Все-то мы, все без исключения, по части науки, развития, мышления, изобретений, идеалов, желаний, либерализма, рассудка, опыта и всего, всего, всего, всего, всего, еще в первом предуготовительном классе гимназии сидим! Понравилось чужим умом пробавляться – въелись! Так ли? Так ли я говорю? – кричал Разумихин, потрясая и сжимая руки обеих дам, – так ли?","- Yes, what do you think? shouted Razumikhin, raising his voice even more, “do you think I am for them lying?” Nonsense! I love it when they lie! Lying is the only human privilege over all organisms. Lie - you will reach the truth! That's why I'm a man that I lie. Not a single truth was reached without lying in advance fourteen times, or maybe a hundred and fourteen, and this is an honorable thing in its own way; well, we can’t lie with our mind! You lie to me, but lie in your own way, and then I will kiss you. To lie in one's own way is almost better than the truth in one's own way; in the first case you are a man, and in the second you are just a bird! The truth will not go away, but life can be nailed down; there were examples. Well, what are we now? All of us, all without exception, in terms of science, development, thinking, inventions, ideals, desires, liberalism, reason, experience and everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, are still in the first preparatory class of the gymnasium! I liked to get by with someone else's mind - eaten! Is not it? Is that what I say? Razumikhin shouted, shaking and squeezing the hands of both ladies, is that right?","“What do you think?” cried Razumikhin, raising his voice even more. “Do you think I’m not in favor of their telling lies? Rubbish! I love it when they tell lies! Lying is a privilege exclusive to humans among all other beings. It’s by lying that one arrives at the truth! I tell lies; therefore, I’m human. We haven’t arrived at any truths without having uttered nonsense beforehand fourteen or so times, perhaps even one hundred and fourteen times, and that’s honorable in its own way; well, we can’t even talk nonsense by relying on our own intelligence! You talk nonsense, but if it’s your own, I’ll kiss you for it. To talk one’s own nonsense is almost better than spouting someone else’s truth. In the first case, you’re a human being; but in the second, you’re only a parrot! Truth doesn’t vanish, but life can be beaten to a pulp; there have been examples. Well, where are we now? All of us, without exception, as regards science, development, thought, inventions, ideals, desires, liberalism, reason, experience, and everything, everything, everything, everything, everything—we’re still sitting in kindergarten! We’ve been pleased to make do with other people’s ideas—and we’ve gotten used to it! Isn’t that so? Aren’t I right?” cried Razumikhin, shaking and squeezing the two women’s hands.","‘So what do you think?’ cried Razumikhin, raising his voice even more. ‘ D’you think I’m complaining because they’re talking nonsense? Not at all! I like people talking nonsense. Talking nonsense is humanity’s only privilege over the rest of creation. If you talk nonsense, you’ll find your way to the truth! Talking nonsense is what makes me human. No one ever found his way to the truth without first getting things wrong fourteen times, or even a hundred and fourteen times, and that’s a good thing in its way; the trouble is we’re not even capable of getting things wrong with our own brains! You can talk nonsense to me, if it’s nonsense of your own, and I’ll kiss you for it. Talking nonsense of your own—that’s almost better than talking someone else’s truth; in the first case you’re human, in the second you’re nothing but a parrot! Truth won’t go away, but life can get choked up; we’ve seen that happen. Well, what are we now? In science, progress, thought, invention, ideals, desires, liberalism, judgement, experience, and all, all, all, all, all of it, we’re every one of us, without exception, still stuck in the first, pre-preparatory class of high school! We’ve got fond of living off other people’s ideas, and now we’re addicted to it! Isn’t that right? Isn’t it?’ cried Razumikhin, shaking and squeezing both ladies’ arms.","“What do you think?” shouted Razumikhin, louder than ever , “you think I am attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk nonsense. That’s man’s one privilege over all creation. Through error you come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and fourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can’t even make mistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense, and I’ll kiss you for it. To go wrong in your own way is better than to go right in someone else’s. In the first case you’re a human being, in the second you’re no better than a bird. Truth won’t escape you, but life can be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now? In science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism, judgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are still in the preparatory class at school. We prefer to live on other people’s ideas, it’s what we are used to! Am I right , am I right?” cried Razumikhin, pressing and shaking the two ladies’ hands."

Outwardly, he looked like a wounded person or someone who is enduring some kind of severe physical pain: his eyebrows were drawn together, his lips were compressed, his eyes were inflamed. He spoke little and reluctantly, as if through force or fulfilling a duty, and some kind of restlessness occasionally appeared in his movements.","It was true, Raskolnikov had almost recovered, especially compared to how he’d felt yesterday.

"– Авдотья Романовна, – закоробившись, произнес Лужин, – ваши слова слишком многозначительны для меня, скажу более, даже обидны, ввиду того положения, которое я имею честь занимать в отношении к вам. Не говоря уже ни слова об обидном и странном сопоставлении, на одну доску, между мной и… заносчивым юношей, словами вашими вы допускаете возможность нарушения данного мне обещания. Вы говорите: «или вы, или он?», стало быть, тем самым показываете мне, как немного я для вас значу… я не могу допустить этого при отношениях и… обязательствах, существующих между нами.","“Avdotya Romanovna,” Luzhin said, trembling, “your words are too significant for me, I will say more, even insulting, in view of the position that I have the honor to occupy in relation to you. Without saying a word about the offensive and strange comparison, on the same level, between me and ... an arrogant young man, with your words you admit the possibility of breaking the promise given to me. You say: “either you or him?”, therefore, thereby showing me how little I mean to you ...

Without saying a word about the insulting and strange juxtaposition, on one level, between me and . . . an arrogant young man, by your words you’re admitting the possibility of breaking the promise you made to me. You say, ‘It’s me or him.’ Therefore, you’re demonstrating how little I mean to you. . . . I can’t allow this in the relations and . . . obligations existing between us.”","‘Avdotya Romanovna,’ said Luzhin in some annoyance, ‘your words are too loaded for me; indeed I would say they’re offensive, in view of the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you. I shall not say a single word about your extraordinary and offensive juxtaposition, on an equal footing, of myself and… an impertinent youth; but in the words you use, you admit of the possibility that a promise made to me may be broken. You say: “either you, or him”; thereby indicating to me how little I mean to you… That is something that I cannot tolerate, in view of the relations and… obligations that obtain between us.’","“Avdotia Romanovna,” Luzhin declared in an offended tone, “your words have too many implications for me; moreover, they are offensive in view of the position I have the honor to occupy in relation to you.

"При входе Сони Разумихин, сидевший на одном из трех стульев Раскольникова, сейчас подле двери, привстал, чтобы дать ей войти. Сначала Раскольников указал было ей место в углу дивана, где сидел Зосимов, но, вспомнив, что этот диван был слишком фамильярное место и служит ему постелью, поспешил указать ей на стул Разумихина.","At Sonya's entrance, Razumikhin, who was sitting on one of Raskolnikov's three chairs, now near the door, half rose to let her in. At first, Raskolnikov pointed out to her a place in the corner of the sofa where Zossimov was sitting, but, remembering that this sofa was too familiar a place and served as his bed, hastened to point her to Razumikhin's chair.","At Sonya’s entrance Razumikhin, who was seated on one of Raskolnikov’s three chairs, at once stood up next to the door to let her pass.

"В эту минуту дверь тихо отворилась, и в комнату, робко озираясь, вошла одна девушка. Все обратились к ней с удивлением и любопытством. Раскольников не узнал ее с первого взгляда. Это была Софья Семеновна Мармеладова. Вчера видел он ее в первый раз, но в такую минуту, при такой обстановке и в таком костюме, что в памяти его отразился образ совсем другого лица. Теперь это была скромно и даже бедно одетая девушка, очень еще молоденькая, почти похожая на девочку, с скромною и приличною манерой, с ясным, но как будто несколько запуганным лицом. На ней было очень простенькое домашнее платьице, на голове старая, прежнего фасона шляпка; только в руках был, по-вчерашнему, зонтик. Увидав неожиданно полную комнату людей, она не то что сконфузилась, но совсем потерялась, оробела, как маленький ребенок, и даже сделала было движение уйти назад.","At that moment the door quietly opened, and a girl entered the room, looking around timidly. Everyone turned to her with surprise and curiosity. Raskolnikov did not recognize her at first sight. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova. Yesterday he saw her for the first time, but at such a moment, in such a situation and in such a costume, that the image of a completely different person was reflected in his memory. Now she was a modestly and even poorly dressed girl, still very young, almost like a girl, with a modest and decent manner, with a clear, but, as it were, somewhat frightened face. She was wearing a very simple house dress, on her head was an old hat of the same style; only in the hands was, in yesterday's way, an umbrella. Seeing the unexpectedly full room of people, she was not only embarrassed, but completely lost, shy, like a small child, and even made a movement to go back.","At that moment, the door opened quietly and a young woman entered the room, glancing around timidly. Everyone turned to her with astonishment and curiosity. Raskolnikov didn’t recognize her at first. It was Sofiya Semyonovna Marmeladova. He’d seen her yesterday for the first time, but at such a moment, in such circumstances, and in such clothes, that he remembered an entirely different face. Now she was a modestly, even poorly dressed young woman, very young indeed, almost like a girl, with modest, proper manners, and an innocent but seemingly frightened face. She was wearing a very simple everyday dress and an old, outmoded hat on her head; but she was carrying a parasol in her hands, as she had yesterday. Unexpectedly seeing a room full of people, she wasn’t merely embarrassed, but overwhelmed; she felt timid as a child and even made a move to leave.","At that moment the door quietly opened and a young girl entered the room, looking timidly about her. Surprised and intrigued, everyone turned towards her. Raskolnikov didn’t recognize her at once. It was Sofia Semionovna Marmeladova. He had seen her for the first time the day before, but at such a time, in such surroundings and dressed in such a way that his memory had retained the picture of quite a different person. Here, now, was a simply, even poorly dressed girl, still very young, almost a child, with a modest and respectable manner and a bright but rather frightened face. She was wearing a very simple house-dress, with an old, unfashionable hat on her head; but still carrying a parasol, as she had yesterday. When she saw to her surprise that the room was full of people, she was not so much embarrassed as disconcerted; she took fright, like a little child, and even made to leave the room again.","AT THAT MOMENT THE door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into the room, looking timidly around her.

She was wearing a very plain indoor dress and a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she was still carrying a parasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a little child. She was even about to retreat."
"– Вам, вам, Софья Семеновна, и, пожалуйста, без особенных разговоров, потому даже мне и некогда. А вам понадобятся. У Родиона Романовича две дороги: или пуля в лоб, или по Владимирке. (Соня дико посмотрела на него и задрожала.) Не беспокойтесь, я все знаю, от него же самого, и я не болтун; никому не скажу. Это вы его хорошо учили тогда, чтоб он сам на себя пошел и сказал. Это ему будет гораздо выгоднее. Ну, как выйдет Владимирка – он по ней, а вы ведь за ним? Ведь так? Ведь так? Ну, а коли так, то, значит, деньги вот и понадобятся. Для него же понадобятся, понимаете? Давая вам, я все равно что ему даю. К тому же вы вот обещались и Амалии Ивановне долг заплатить; я ведь слышал. Что это вы, Софья Семеновна, так необдуманно всё такие контракты и обязательства на себя берете? Ведь Катерина Ивановна осталась должна этой немке, а не вы, так и наплевать бы вам на немку. Так на свете не проживешь. Ну-с, если вас когда кто будет спрашивать, – ну завтра или послезавтра, – обо мне или насчет меня (а вас-то будут спрашивать), то вы о том, что я теперь к вам заходил, не упоминайте и деньги отнюдь не показывайте и не сказывайте, что я вам дал, никому. Ну, теперь до свиданья. (Он встал со стула.) Родиону Романычу поклон. Кстати: держите-ка деньги-то до времени хоть у господина Разумихина. Знаете господина Разумихина? Уж конечно, знаете. Это малый так себе. Снесите-ка к нему, завтра или… когда придет время. А до тех пор подальше спрячьте.","- To you, to you, Sofya Semyonovna, and, please, without much talk, because even I have no time. And you will need. Rodion Romanovich has two roads: either a bullet in the forehead, or along Vladimirka. (Sonya looked wildly at him and trembled.) Don't worry, I know everything from him, and I'm not a talker; I won't tell anyone. It was you who taught him well then, so that he would go to himself and say. It will be much more profitable for him. Well, how will Vladimirka come out - he follows her, and you follow him? It is so? It is so? Well, if so, it means that money will be needed here. He will need it, you understand? Giving you, I'm like giving him. Besides, you promised to pay the debt to Amalia Ivanovna too; I've heard. Why are you, Sofya Semyonovna, so thoughtlessly taking on all such contracts and obligations? After all, Katerina Ivanovna owed this German woman, and not you, and you wouldn’t give a damn about the German woman. So you can't live in the world. Well, if someone asks you when, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, about me or about me (and they will ask you), then you don’t mention the fact that I’ve come to you just now, and the money is by no means show and don't tell what I gave you to anyone. Well, goodbye now. (He got up from his chair.) Bow to Rodion Romanych. By the way: keep the money until the time at least with Mr. Razumikhin. Do you know Mr. Razumikhin? Of course you know. This is a small one. Take it to him, tomorrow or ... when the time comes. Until then, stay away.","“It’s for you, for you, Sofiya Semyonovna, and please, without further conversation, because I have no time for it. And you’ll need it. Rodion Romanovich has two paths open to him: either a bullet in his brain or Siberia.” Sonya looked at him wildly and began trembling. “Don’t be upset. I know everything, from him, and I’m not a blabbermouth; I won’t tell a soul. You gave him good advice before, when you told him to go to the police and confess. That would be much more beneficial for him. Well, if it’s Siberia—he’ll go and I suppose that you’ll follow him. Is that the case? Is it? Well, if so, that means you’ll have need of money. You’ll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same as giving it to him. Besides which, you just promised to pay your debt to Amaliya Ivanovna; I heard you. Why do you, Sofiya Semyonovna, assume all these contracts and debts so thoughtlessly? It was Katerina Ivanovna who owed money to that German woman, not you; you ought not to give a damn about her. That’s not the way to go on living in this world. Well then, if someone should ever ask you—say, tomorrow or the day after—about me or concerning me (and they will ask), don’t mention the fact that I’ve come to see you now and don’t say anything to anyone or show anyone the money I’ve given you. Well, now it’s good-bye.” He stood up from the chair. “My regards to Rodion Romanych. By the way: keep the money with Mr. Razumikhin until it’s time. Do you know Mr. Razumikhin? Of course you do. He’s not a bad fellow. Take it to him tomorrow or . . . when the time comes. And until then, stash it away.”","‘It’s for you, for you, Sofia Semionovna, and please don’t go on about it, I haven’t time. And you’ll need it. Rodion Romanovich has one of two ways to go—either a bullet through his head, or off along the Vladimirka.’ * (Sonia gaped at him and began trembling.) ‘Don’t worry, I know all about it, from his own lips, and I’m not a chatterbox; I shan’t tell anyone. You were quite right when you told him to hand himself in and confess. That’ll be much better for him. So, and when they send him out along the Vladimirka—he’ll go, and you’ll follow, won’t you? Surely you will, won’t you? Well then, if you do, you’ll need that money. You’ll need it for him, understand? By giving it to you, I’m as good as giving it to him. Besides, you promised to pay Amalia Ivanovna what she’s owed; I heard you. How can you take on all those commitments and obligations, Sofia Semionovna, without thinking them through? After all, it was Katerina Ivanovna, not you, who was in debt to that German woman; so you could have let her go hang. You won’t survive long like that. Now, if anyone ever asks you—say, tomorrow or the next day—about me or anything to do with me (and they will ask you), you mustn’t mention that I came round to you today, and don’t show the money to anyone, and don’t tell anyone about it, anyone at all. There, and now goodbye.’ He rose from his chair. ‘My regards to Rodion Romanich. Incidentally: you ought to hand over that money for safe keeping, to Mr Razumikhin, say, for the time being. You know Mr Razumikhin? Of course you do. He’s all right, that young man. Take it to him tomorrow or… when the time comes. And till then, hide it away.’","“It’s for you, for you, Sofia Semionovna, and please don’t waste words over it. I haven’t got the time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovich has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia.” (Sonia looked wildly at him, and started.) “Don’t be uneasy, I know all about it from his own lips and I am not a gossip; I won’t tell anyone. It was good advice when you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much better for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and you will follow him. That’s so, isn’t it? And if so, you’ll need money. You’ll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same as my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay what you owe. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so carelessly, Sofia Semionovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt and not yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman. You can’t get through the world like that. If you are ever questioned about me—tomorrow or the day after you will be asked—don’t say anything about the fact that I am coming to see you now and don’t show the money to anyone or say a word about it. Well, now, goodbye.” (He got up.) “My greetings to Rodion Romanovich. By the way, you’d better put the money for the present in Mr. Razumikhin’s keeping. You know Mr. Razumikhin? Of course you do. He’s not a bad man. Take it to him tomorrow or . . . when the time comes. And until then, hide it carefully.”"
"– Я уж не говорю про него, – прибавил Раскольников, указывая на Разумихина, – а тоже, кроме оскорблений и хлопот, ничего от меня не видал.","“I’m not even talking about him,” Raskolnikov added, pointing to Razumikhin, “and, apart from insults and troubles, he didn’t see anything from me either.","“I’m not even talking about him,” added Raskolnikov, indicating Razumikhin. “He, too, has had nothing from me except insults and worries.”","‘Not to mention him there,’ added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumikhin; ‘but he’s had nothing from me either, except insults and trouble.’","“Let alone him,” added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumikhin, “though he has had nothing from me either but insults and trouble.”"

Пульхерия Александровна заплакала.","He waved weakly at Razumikhin in order to stop the whole stream of his incoherent and ardent consolations addressed to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand and for two minutes silently peered first at one, then at the other. The mother was frightened by his gaze. In this look, a feeling was strong to the point of suffering, but at the same time there was something motionless, even as if insane. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.","He motioned weakly to Razumikhin to end his nonstop stream of incoherent and passionate words of consolation addressed to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand, and for a few moments stared in silence, first at one, then at the other.

Pulkheria Alexandrovna burst into tears.","He waved his hand weakly at Razumikhin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations he was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.

"– Господин-то Разумихин! – вскричал Порфирий Петрович, точно обрадовавшись вопросу все молчавшего Раскольникова, – хе! хе! хе! Да господина Разумихина так и надо было прочь отвести: двоим любо, третий не суйся. Господин Разумихин не то-с, да и человек посторонний, прибежал ко мне весь такой бледный… Ну, да бог с ним, что его сюда мешать! А насчет Миколки угодно ли вам знать, что это за сюжет, в том виде, как то есть я его понимаю? Перво-наперво это еще дитя несовершеннолетнее, и не то чтобы трус, а так, вроде как бы художника какого-нибудь. Право-с, вы не смейтесь, что я так его изъясняю. Невинен и ко всему восприимчив. Сердце имеет; фантаст. Он и петь, он и плясать, он и сказки, говорят, так рассказывает, что из других мест сходятся слушать. И в школу ходить, и хохотать до упаду оттого, что пальчик покажут, и пьянствовать до бесчувствия, не то чтоб от разврата, а так, полосами, когда напоят, по-детски еще. Он тогда вот и украл, а и сам этого не знает; потому «коли на земле поднял, что за украл?». А известно ли вам, что он из раскольников, да и не то чтоб из раскольников, а просто сектант; у него в роде бегуны бывали, и сам он еще недавно целых два года в деревне у некоего старца под духовным началом был. Все это я от Миколки и от зарайских его узнал. Да куды! просто в пустыню бежать хотел! Рвение имел, по ночам богу молился, книги старые, «истинные» читал и зачитывался. Петербург на него сильно подействовал, особенно женский пол, ну, и вино. Восприимчив-с, и старца, и все забыл. Известно мне, его художник один здесь полюбил, к нему ходить стал, да вот этот случай и подошел! Ну, обробел – вешаться! Бежать! Что ж делать с понятием, которое прошло в народе о нашей юридистике! Иному ведь страшно слово «засудят». Кто виноват! Вот что-то новые суды скажут. Ох, дал бы бог! Ну-с; в остроге-то и вспомнился, видно, теперь честной старец; Библия тоже явилась опять. Знаете ли, Родион Романыч, что значит у иных из них «пострадать»? Это не то чтобы за кого-нибудь, а так просто «пострадать надо»; страдание, значит, принять, а от властей – так тем паче. Сидел в мое время один смиреннейший арестант целый год в остроге, на печи по ночам все Библию читал, ну и зачитался, да зачитался, знаете, совсем, да так, что ни с того ни с сего сгреб кирпич и кинул в начальника, безо всякой обиды с его стороны. Да и как кинул-то: нарочно на аршин мимо взял, чтобы какого вреда не произвести! Ну, известно, какой конец арестанту, который с оружием кидается на начальство: и «принял, значит, страдание». Так вот, я и подозреваю теперь, что Миколка хочет «страдание принять» или вроде того. Это я наверно, даже по фактам, знаю-с. Он только сам не знает, что я знаю. Что, не допускаете, что ли, чтоб из такого народа выходили люди фантастические? Да сплошь. Старец теперь опять начал действовать, особенно после петли-то припомнился. А впрочем, сам мне все расскажет, придет. Вы думаете, выдержит? Подождите, еще отопрется! С часу на час жду, что придет от показания отказываться. Я этого Миколку полюбил и его досконально исследую. И как бы вы думали! Хе! хе! на иные-то пункты весьма складно мне отвечал, очевидно, нужные сведения получил, ловко приготовился; ну а по другим пунктам просто как в лужу, ничегошечко не знает, не ведает, да и сам не подозревает, что не ведает! Нет, батюшка Родион Романыч, тут не Миколка! Тут дело фантастическое, мрачное, дело современное, нашего времени случай-с, когда помутилось сердце человеческое; когда цитуется фраза, что кровь «освежает»; когда вся жизнь проповедуется в комфорте. Тут книжные мечты-с, тут теоретически раздраженное сердце; тут видна решимость на первый шаг, но решимость особого рода, – решился, да как с горы упал или с колокольни слетел, да и на преступление-то словно не своими ногами пришел. Дверь за собой забыл притворить, а убил, двух убил, по теории. Убил, да и денег взять не сумел, а что успел захватить, то под камень снес. Мало было ему, что муку вынес, когда за дверью сидел, а в дверь ломились и колокольчик звонил, – нет, он потом уж на пустую квартиру, в полубреде, припомнить этот колокольчик идет, холоду спинного опять испытать потребовалось…. Ну, да это, положим, в болезни, а то вот еще: убил, да за честного человека себя почитает, людей презирает, бледным ангелом ходит, – нет, уж какой тут Миколка, голубчик Родион Романыч, тут не Миколка!","- Mr. Razumikhin! cried Porfiry Petrovich, as if delighted at the question of the silent Raskolnikov, “heh! heh! heh! Yes, Mr. Razumikhin should have been taken away: it’s nice for two, don’t bother with the third. Mr. Razumikhin is not right, and besides, a stranger, he ran up to me all so pale ... Well, God bless him, why bother him here! And as for Mikolka, would you like to know what kind of plot it is, in the form, that is, as I understand it? First of all, this is still a child of a minor, and not exactly a coward, but just like some kind of artist. Really, sir, don't laugh at me explaining him like that. Innocent and susceptible to everything. The heart has; fantastic. He sings, he dances, he tells fairy tales, they say, so that they come from other places to listen. And go to school, and laugh until you drop because they show a finger, and drink to insensibility, not so much from debauchery, but like that, in stripes, when they get drunk, still childishly. He then stole it, but he himself does not know it; because “if you picked it up on the ground, what did you steal?”. But do you know that he is one of the schismatics, and not exactly one of the schismatics, but simply a sectarian; there were runners in his family, and until recently he himself had been in the village for two whole years under a certain old man under spiritual guidance. I learned all this from Mikolka and from the Zaraysk people. Yes, where! I just wanted to run into the desert! He had zeal, prayed to God at night, read old, “true” books and read them out. Petersburg had a strong effect on him, especially the female sex, well, and wine. Receptive, sir, and an old man, and forgot everything. I know that his artist alone fell in love here, began to go to him, but this case came up! Well, grown shy - hang yourself! Run! What to do with the concept that has passed among the people about our jurisprudence! After all, the word “sue” is scary for someone else. Who's guilty! Here is something the new courts will say. Oh, God willing! Well, sir; in prison, and I remembered, apparently, now an honest old man; The Bible also appeared again. Do you know, Rodion Romanych, what it means for some of them to ""suffer""? It’s not that for anyone, but it’s just “you have to suffer”; suffering means to accept, and from the authorities - so much the more so. In my time, one most humble prisoner sat for a whole year in prison, read the whole Bible at night on the stove, well, he read it, and he read it, you know, completely, so much so that for no reason at all he grabbed a brick and threw it at the chief, without any resentment on his part. Yes, and how he threw it: on purpose he took it a yard past, so as not to cause any harm! Well, it is known what the end is for a prisoner who throws himself at the authorities with a weapon: and ""accepted, therefore, suffering."" So, now I suspect that Mikolka wants to ""accept suffering"" or something like that. This I probably, even on the facts, I know, sir. He just doesn't know that I know. What, you don’t allow, perhaps, that fantastic people come out of such a people? Yes, all the way. The elder now began to act again, especially after the noose he remembered. And yet, he will tell me everything, he will come. Do you think it will last? Wait, it will open again! From hour to hour I wait for him to refuse the testimony. I fell in love with this Mikolka and I will study him thoroughly. And what would you think! Heh! heh! on other points he answered me very smoothly, obviously, he received the necessary information, deftly prepared himself; well, on other points it’s just like a puddle, he doesn’t know anything, he doesn’t know, and he himself doesn’t suspect that he doesn’t know! No, father Rodion Romanych, this is not Mikolka! This is a fantastic, gloomy matter, a modern matter, a case of our time, sir, when the human heart was clouded; when the phrase is quoted that blood ""refreshes""; when all life is preached in comfort. Here are book dreams, sir, here is a theoretically irritated heart; here one can see determination on the first step, but determination of a special kind - he decided, but how he fell from the mountain or flew off the bell tower, and it was as if he had come to the crime not with his own feet. He forgot to close the door behind him, but he killed, killed two, according to theory. He killed, and he didn’t manage to take the money, and what he managed to capture, he demolished under a stone. It wasn’t enough for him that he endured the torment when he was sitting outside the door, and the door was bursting and the bell rang - no, then he would go to an empty apartment, half-delirious, to remember this bell goes, it was necessary to experience the cold of the spinal cord again .... Well, yes, let’s say he’s sick, otherwise he’s killed, but he considers himself an honest man, he despises people, walks like a pale angel - no, what kind of Mikolka is here, dear Rodion Romanych, this is not Mikolka!","“Mr. Razumikhin!” cried Porfiry Petrovich, as if overjoyed by the question from Raskolnikov, who up to then had maintained his silence. “Hee-hee-hee! Mr. Razumikhin had to be deflected: two’s company, but three’s a crowd. Mr. Razumikhin’s not the one, sir; he’s an outsider; he came running to me completely pale. . . . Well, never mind about him. Why involve him in this? As far as Mikolka’s concerned, would you care to know what sort of fellow he is, in the sense that I understand him? First of all, he’s still an immature child; not exactly a coward, but more like some artist. It’s true, sir, don’t laugh at the way I’m explaining him. He’s innocent and very impressionable. He has a heart and a vivid imagination. He knows how to sing and dance, and, they say, he tells stories so well that people come from afar to listen. He goes to school, is too easy to make laugh, and drinks himself silly, not from debauchery, but in spurts, when someone plies him with drink, again just like a child. And at that time when he stole something, he himself didn’t know what he was doing, because ‘if he picked it up from the floor, what sort of theft was that?’ Do you know that he’s one of the schismatics,‡ not exactly a schismatic, but simply a sectarian; some people in his family were Runners.§ Not long ago, he himself ran off and spent two whole years in the country under the spiritual guidance of an elderly monk. I found all this out from Mikolka and from his friends in Zaraysk. Imagine that! He wanted to run off into the wilderness! He was a zealot, prayed to God at night, studied the ‘genuine’ old books and read himself silly. Petersburg made a very strong impression on him, especially the female sex, and the vodka as well. He’s very impressionable, sir, and he forgot all about his elder and about everything else. I know that a local artist took a liking to him: he started visiting Mikolka, and then this incident occurred! Well, he lost heart—and attempted to hang himself. He tried to run away! What can be done about this view of our judicial system widespread among the people? Some find the words ‘he will be condemned’ simply terrifying. Who’s to blame? The new courts may change all that. Oh, God grant they will! Well, sir, now that he’s in prison, he’s apparently remembered his honest elder; his Bible’s also reappeared. Do you know, Rodion Romanych, what the word ‘suffering’ means for some of these people? It’s not exactly for anyone else, but it’s simply ‘necessary to suffer.’ That means to accept suffering; if it’s from the powers that be, so much the better. In my time, there was an extremely submissive convict who spent a whole year in prison; he read the Bible at night sitting on the stove bench, and read himself silly to such an extent that for no reason at all he grabbed hold of a brick and hurled it at the prison warden without any particular grievance. And how did he throw it? He intentionally threw it a yard wide so it wouldn’t hurt anybody! Well, you know what happens to a prisoner who attacks a supervisor with a weapon: ‘he accepted his suffering.’ So I suspect that now Mikolka wants to ‘accept his suffering’ or something like that. I know this for certain, even from the facts, sir. Only he himself doesn’t know that I know. What, don’t you think that such wildly imaginative types can come from the common people? There are a lot of them! The elder’s begun influencing him again, especially after Mikolka tried to hang himself. However, he’ll come to me and tell me everything. You think he’ll be able to hold out? Just wait, he’ll deny it all! I’m waiting for him to come at any moment and recant his testimony. I’ve taken a liking to this Mikolka and am investigating him thoroughly. What do you think? Hee-hee! He replied to several points extremely coherently; obviously he’d received the necessary information and had prepared himself skillfully; but he simply doesn’t know anything about certain other matters, and he waded in too deep; he knows nothing, and he himself doesn’t even suspect that he doesn’t know! No, my dear Rodion Romanych, Mikolka’s not involved in this affair at all! This is a fantastic case, an ominous, contemporary case, and an instance of our time, sir, when the human heart has grown dark; when one can hear it said that blood ‘refreshes’; when all of life is devoted to comfort. There are bookish dreams here, sir, a heart that’s irritated by theories; one sees decisiveness at every step, but decisiveness of a special kind—he did resolve, but as if falling off a mountain or jumping from a bell tower, and he went out to commit the crime as if unwillingly. He forgot to lock the door behind him, and he killed, he killed two people in accordance with a theory. He killed, but he didn’t know how to steal the money; and what he managed to grab, he hid under a stone. It wasn’t enough for him to endure the torment as he stood behind the door, as they banged on it and rang the doorbell— no, later he goes back to this empty apartment in a semi-delirium to recall that doorbell; he needs to experience yet again that cold shiver running up and down his spine. . . . Well, that was probably his illness, but here’s what else: he killed, but he considers himself an honest man; he despises people, he walks about like some pale angel—no, how can Mikolka be connected with this, my dear Rodion Romanych? Mikolka’s not involved at all!”","‘Oh, that Mr Razumikhin!’ cried Porfiry Petrovich, apparently delighted that Raskolnikov, obstinately silent so far, had come up with a question. ‘ Heh-heh-heh! Mr Razumikhin—I simply needed to put him off. Two’s company, three’s a crowd. Mr Razumikhin doesn’t come into it at all, for all that he came running to see me, white as a sheet… Well, bless the man, why mix him up in all this? But as for Mikolka, do you want to know what sort of a man he is, I mean, as I see him? First of all, he’s still a child , he’s never grown up; not exactly a coward, but some sort of an artist, in my view. Honestly, don’t laugh at me for putting it like that. He’s an innocent soul, very impressionable. He has a good heart, but he lets his imagination run away with him. He’ll sing for you, and dance for you, and tell stories—such stories that folk will come a long way just to hear them. He’s been to school, and he’ll giggle himself silly over a rude sign, and drink himself unconscious, not because he’s a vicious character but just because someone plies him with drink; just like a child, as I said. He committed a theft, that time, but he never realized it, because he thought, “If I found it lying on the ground, what kind of theft is that?” And do you realize, he’s a schismatic, well, not exactly a schismatic, but a sectarian; some of his family once joined the “Runaways”, and he himself, quite recently, spent a whole two years in the provinces as a disciple of some starets or other. * I found all that out from Mikolka himself and his people from Zaraysk. Honestly! He was actually wanting to run away into the wilderness! He had an urge of that sort, praying to God every night, reading himself silly out of old books, seeking for the “truth”. Petersburg had a powerful effect on him, particularly the women, and the vodka too, of course. But he’s impressionable; he forgot about the starets and everything else. I happen to know that there was a painter here who took a liking to him, and Mikolka used to go and see him; and then this business happened! Well, he took fright—wanted to hang himself! To run away! What’s to be done, when people have notions like that about our legal system? I mean, some people are terrified of the word “trial”. Whose fault is that? The new courts may change things a bit. I hope to God they do! Well, when he was in prison he apparently remembered that honest starets; and the Bible reappeared again. Do you know, Rodion Romanich, what the idea of “suffering” means to some of those people? It doesn’t mean suffering on someone else’s behalf; it’s just the idea that “one has to suffer”; you have to accept suffering, and if it comes from the authorities, so much the better. In my time there was one very meek convict who served a whole year in prison, and every night he’d lie on the stove reading the Bible, and read and read so much that one day, out of the blue, he pulled out a brick and threw it at the governor, without the slightest provocation. And the way he threw it—a whole yard wide, on purpose, to be sure of not hurting him. Well, you know what happens to a convict who commits an armed assault on an officer; so there it was, he “accepted his suffering”. Well then—I suspect now that Mikolka wants to “accept suffering”, or something like that. I’m certain of it, there are facts that prove I’m right. Only he himself doesn’t know that I know. Why, surely you’d agree that this class of people throws up men with weird ideas? They’re everywhere! That starets has begun to weigh on Mikolka again, especially after he tried to hang himself. But he’ll come to me of his own accord and tell me everything. Do you think he’ll be able to hold out? Just you wait, he’ll recant all right! I’m expecting him hour by hour to come and take back his confession. I’ve taken a liking to this Mikolka, and I’m going to investigate him thoroughly. And what do you think? Heh-heh! He gave me the most convincing answers to some points— he’d obviously got hold of the information he needed, and made up a good story; and then on other points he fell flat on his face, didn’t know the first thing; not only he didn’t know anything, but he didn’t even realize that he didn’t know! No, my dear old Rodion Romanich, this isn’t about Mikolka! This is a fantastic, murky business, a modern affair, a sign of our times, of the darkness of the human heart; when people quote the idea that blood “refreshes”;* when life is supposed to be all about comfort. These are dreams got up out of books; hearts troubled by theories. You see a man resolving to take a first step, but his resolution is of a special kind—he resolves to do it, and then it’s as if he’d fallen off a cliff or thrown himself off a steeple, * and he goes off to commit his crime without knowing what he’s doing. He forgets to close the door behind him; but he’s committed a murder, two murders, all because of a theory. He committed murder, but didn’t manage to pick up the money; and what he did pick up, he went and hid under a stone. And as if the agony he went through wasn’t enough for him, hiding behind the door while they were hammering at it and ringing the bell—no, he had to go back to that empty flat, half-delirious, to remind himself about that bell; he needed to get that chill down his spine all over again… Very well, he was ill when he did that; but what about this: he’s committed a murder, but he still regards himself as an honest man, despises other people, walks around like a pale angel… no , what’s this got to do with Mikolka, my dear Rodion Romanich? There’s no Mikolka in all this!’","“Mr. Razumikhin!” cried Porfiry Petrovich, seeming glad of a question from Raskolnikov, who had until then been silent. “He-he-he! But I had to put Mr. Razumikhin off; two is company, three is none. Mr. Razumikhin is not the right man; besides, he is an outsider. He came running to me with a pale face . . . But never mind him, why bring him into it! To return to Nikolai, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how I understand him, that is? To begin with, he is still a child and not exactly a coward, but something of an artist. Really, don’t laugh at my describing him like that. He is innocent and open to influence. He has a heart, he is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, he tells stories, they say, so well that people come from other villages to hear him. He attends school too, and laughs until he cries if you hold up a finger to him; he will drink himself senseless—not as a regular vice, but at times when people treat him like a child. And he stole, too, then, without knowing it himself, for ‘How can it be stealing, if you pick it up?’ And do you know he is an Old Believer,62 or rather a dissenter? There have been Wanderers63 in his family, and for two years in his village he was under the spiritual guidance of an elder. I learnt all this from Nikolai and his fellow villagers. And what’s more, he wanted to run into the wilderness! He was full of fervor, prayed at night, read the old books, ‘the true’ ones, and read himself crazy.”— “Petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and the wine. He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that. I learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see him, and now this business came along. “Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself! He ran away! How can you get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings! The very word ‘trial’ frightens some of them. Whose fault is it? We shall see what the new juries will do. God grant they do good! Well, in prison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder, the Bible, too, made its appearance again. Do you know, Rodion Romanovich, the force of the word ‘suffering’ among some of these people! It’s not a question of suffering for someone’s benefit, but simply, ‘you must suffer.’ If they suffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better. In my time there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison always reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himself crazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, he seized a brick and flung it at the governor, though he had done him no harm. And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side on purpose, for fear of hurting him. Well, we know what happens to a prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon. So ‘he took his suffering.’ “So I suspect now that Nikolai wants to take his suffering or something of the sort. I even know it for certain from the facts. Only he doesn’t know that I know. What, you don’t admit that there are such fantastic people among the peasants? Lots of them. The elder now has begun influencing him, especially since he tried to hang himself. But he’ll come and tell me everything himself. You think he’ll hold out? Wait a bit, he’ll take his words back. I am waiting hour by hour for him to come and swear in his evidence. I have come to like that Nikolai and am studying him in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He answered me very plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence and prepared himself cleverly. But on other points he is simply at sea, knows nothing and doesn’t even suspect that he doesn’t know! “No, Rodion Romanovich, Nikolai doesn’t come into it! This is a fantastic, gloomy business, a modern case, an incident of our time, when the heart of man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood ‘renews,’ when comfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, a heart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage, but resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the crime. He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for a theory. He committed the murder and couldn’t take the money, and what he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone. It wasn’t enough for him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and rung the bell, no, he had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to recall the bell-ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again ... Well, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he is a murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others, poses as an injured innocent. No, that’s not the work of a Nikolai, my dear Rodion Romanovich!”"
"– Принимаю! Послушаем, пожалуйста, как он выведет!","- I accept! Let's hear, please, how he will bring it out!",“I take the bet! Please let’s hear how he proves it!”,‘Done! Let’s hear him make the deduction!’,"“Done! Let’s hear, please, how he will prove it!”"
"– Есть на тебе крест? – вдруг неожиданно спросила она, точно вдруг вспомнила.","- Do you have a cross? she suddenly asked suddenly, as if she had suddenly remembered.","“Do you have a cross?” she asked suddenly and unexpectedly, as if she had just remembered.","‘Have you a cross on you?’ she asked suddenly and unexpectedly, as if she had just remembered.","“Do you have you a cross on you?” she asked, as though she was suddenly thinking of it."
"– Совсем не бледен… напротив, совсем здоров! – грубо и злобно отрезал Раскольников, вдруг переменяя тон. Злоба в нем накипала, и он не мог подавить ее. «А в злобе-то и проговорюсь! – промелькнуло в нем опять. – А зачем они меня мучают!..»","- Not at all pale ... on the contrary, quite healthy! Raskolnikov snapped rudely and angrily, suddenly changing his tone. Anger boiled up in him, and he could not suppress it. “And in anger, I’ll talk! flashed through him again. “Why are they torturing me!”","“Not at all . . . on the contrary, I’m completely well!” Raskolnikov replied rudely and angrily, suddenly changing his tone. Malice was seething in him, and he was unable to suppress it. “If I speak in anger, I’ll give myself away!” occurred to him again. “Why are they tormenting me?”","‘I’m not in the least pale… on the contrary, I’m perfectly well!’ snapped Raskolnikov rudely and venomously, suddenly changing his tone. Irrepressible fury was boiling up inside him. ‘If I’m furious, I’ll let something slip!’ flashed through his mind again. ‘But what are they tormenting me for?…’","“I am not pale at all . . . No, I am well again,” Raskolnikov snapped out rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger was mounting, he could not repress it. “And in this angry mood I’ll give myself away,” flashed through his mind again. “Why are they torturing me?”"
"– Можно-с, но… это мы потом-с… то есть можно бы начать и сегодня. Вечером увидимся, сговоримся и положим, так сказать, основание. Зайдите ко мне сюда часов этак в семь. Андрей Семенович, надеюсь, тоже будет участвовать с нами… Но… тут есть одно обстоятельство, о котором следует предварительно и тщательно упомянуть. Для сего-то я и обеспокоил вас, Софья Семеновна, моим зовом сюда. Именно-с, мое мнение, – что деньги нельзя, да и опасно давать в руки самой Катерине Ивановне; доказательство же сему – эти самые сегодняшние поминки. Не имея, так сказать, одной корки насущной пищи на завтрашний день и… ну, и обуви и всего, покупается сегодня ямайский ром и даже, кажется, мадера и-и-и кофе. Я видел проходя. Завтра же опять все на вас обрушится, до последнего куска хлеба; это уже нелепо-с. А потому и подписка, по моему личному взгляду, должна произойти так, чтобы несчастная вдова, так сказать, и не знала о деньгах, а знали бы, например, только вы. Так ли я говорю?","- It is possible, sir, but ... we will later, sir ... that is, we could start today. See you in the evening, come to an agreement and lay, so to speak, the foundation. Come and see me here at seven o'clock. Andrey Semyonovich, I hope, will also participate with us... But... there is one circumstance that should be carefully mentioned beforehand. It was for this reason that I disturbed you, Sofya Semyonovna, with my call here. Precisely, sir, my opinion is that it is impossible, and indeed dangerous, to give money into the hands of Katerina Ivanovna herself; the proof of this is today's commemoration. Not having, so to speak, one crust of daily food for tomorrow and ... well, shoes and everything, Jamaican rum is bought today and even, it seems, Madeira and-and-and coffee. I saw passing. Tomorrow, everything will fall on you again, to the last piece of bread; this is already ridiculous. And therefore the subscription, in my personal opinion, should take place in such a way that the unfortunate widow, so to speak, does not know about the money, but, for example, only you would know. Is that what I say?","“It might be possible . . . but we’ll talk about it later . . . that is, we could start it even today. We’ll see this evening; we’ll discuss it and lay, so to speak, the foundation. Come to see me here this evening around seven o’clock. Andrey Semyonych, I hope, will also participate with us. . . . But . . . there’s one circumstance involved that must be mentioned beforehand and in detail. That’s why I have disturbed you, Sofiya Semyonovna, with my summons here. Namely, it’s my opinion that money must not be given directly to Katerina Ivanovna: it’s dangerous; the evidence for that is the funeral feast planned for today. Without having, so to speak, a crust of bread for tomorrow’s meals and . . . well, any money for shoes or anything else, she’s purchased Jamaican rum and even, it seems, Madeira, and—and—and coffee. I saw it as I came past. Tomorrow it will all fall upon you again, for the last piece of bread; this is absurd. Therefore, even the subscription, in my personal opinion, must be carried out so that the unfortunate widow, so to speak, doesn’t know about the money, but that you, for example, are the only one who knows. Am I right?”","‘It might be done, but… we’ll come back to that later… I mean, one might begin this very day. We’ll see each other this evening, decide what to do, and lay the foundations, as it were. Come and see me here around seven or so. Andrei Semionovich will join in too, I hope… But… There’s a certain matter that needs to be mentioned and carefully considered beforehand. That was why I troubled you, Sofia Semionovna, and asked you to come up here. The fact is that, in my view, it is inadvisable and dangerous to give money for Katerina Ivanovna into her own hands. The proof of that is this very funeral wake taking place today. At a time when she hasn’t a single crust of daily bread set aside for tomorrow, nor… well, nor any shoes or the rest of it—she buys Jamaica rum, and even Madeira I believe, and—and—and coffee. I saw all that on my way past. And tomorrow everything will fall back onto your shoulders, right down to the last bit of bread. That’s ridiculous, I tell you. So that any subscription, in my own personal opinion, would have to be organized so that the unfortunate widow, so to speak, knew nothing about the money, and only you, for instance, knew about it. Am I right?’","“It might be, but we will talk about that later. We might start today, we will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation, so to speak. Come to me at seven o’clock. Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. But there is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and for which I would like to trouble you, Sofia Semionovna, to come here. In my opinion money cannot be . . . in fact, it’s unsafe to put it into Katerina Ivanovna’s own hands. The dinner today proves that. Though she has not, so to speak, even got a crust of bread for tomorrow and . . . well, boots or shoes, or anything; she has bought Jamaica rum today, and even, I believe, Madeira and . . . and coffee. I saw it as I passed through. Tomorrow it will all fall upon you again, they won’t have a crust of bread. It’s absurd, really, and so, the way I see it, a subscription should be raised so that the unhappy widow would not know of the money’s existence —only you would, for instance. Am I right?”"
"Было около девяти часов, когда он проходил по Сенной. Все торговцы на столах, на лотках, в лавках и в лавочках запирали свои заведения или снимали и прибирали свой товар и расходились по домам, равно как и их покупатели. Около харчевен в нижних этажах, на грязных и вонючих дворах домов Сенной площади, а наиболее у распивочных, толпилось много разного и всякого сорта промышленников и лохмотников. Раскольников преимущественно любил эти места, равно как и все близлежащие переулки, когда выходил без цели на улицу. Тут лохмотья его не обращали на себя ничьего высокомерного внимания, и можно было ходить в каком угодно виде, никого не скандализируя. У самого К—ного переулка, на углу, мещанин и баба, жена его, торговали с двух столов товаром: нитками, тесемками, платками ситцевыми и т. п. Они тоже поднимались домой, но замешкались, разговаривая с подошедшею знакомой. Знакомая эта была Лизавета Ивановна, или просто, как все звали ее, Лизавета, младшая сестра той самой старухи Алены Ивановны, коллежской регистраторши и процентщицы, у которой вчера был Раскольников, приходивший закладывать ей часы и делать свою пробу… Он давно уже знал все про эту Лизавету, и даже та его знала немного. Это была высокая, неуклюжая, робкая и смиренная девка, чуть не идиотка, тридцати пяти лет, бывшая в полном рабстве у сестры своей, работавшая на нее день и ночь, трепетавшая перед ней и терпевшая от нее даже побои. Она стояла в раздумье с узлом перед мещанином и бабой и внимательно слушала их. Те что-то ей с особенным жаром толковали. Когда Раскольников вдруг увидел ее, какое-то странное ощущение, похожее на глубочайшее изумление, охватило его, хотя во встрече этой не было ничего изумительного.","It was about nine o'clock when he passed the Haymarket. All merchants on tables, on stalls, in shops and in shops locked their establishments or removed and tidied up their goods and went home, as did their customers. Near the taverns in the lower floors, in the filthy and smelly courtyards of the houses of Sennaya Square, and most of them at the taverns, there were many different and all kinds of industrialists and rags. Raskolnikov mostly loved these places, as well as all the nearby alleys, when he went out into the street without a goal. Here his rags did not attract anyone's arrogant attention, and one could walk in any form, without scandalizing anyone. Near K — noy alley, on the corner, a tradesman and a woman, his wife, were selling goods from two tables: threads, ribbons, chintz shawls, etc. They also went home, but hesitated, talking with a friend who had approached. This acquaintance was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or simply, as everyone called her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of that same old woman Alena Ivanovna, the collegiate registrar and pawnbroker who had Raskolnikov yesterday, who came to lay her watch and make his test ... He had long known everything about this Lizaveta, and even she knew him a little. She was a tall, awkward, timid and humble girl, almost an idiot, thirty-five years old, who was in complete slavery to her sister, who worked for her day and night, trembled in front of her and even suffered beatings from her. She stood in thought with a bundle in front of the bourgeois and the woman and listened attentively to them. They interpreted something to her with special ardor. When Raskolnikov suddenly saw her, some strange sensation, similar to the deepest amazement, seized him, although there was nothing amazing about this meeting.","It was almost nine o’clock when he passed through the Haymarket. All the merchants at their tables, stands, shops, and stalls were locking up their establishments, removing and packing up their wares, and dispersing to their homes, just as their customers were. Around the eating houses on the filthy, stinking lower floors of the buildings on Haymarket Square, and especially in the taverns, were gathered all sorts of craftsmen and ragpickers. Raskolnikov loved these places primarily, just as he did all the nearest lanes, when he would walk the streets aimlessly. Here his tattered clothes attracted no unwarranted attention and he could make his way in any apparel without creating a scandal. At Konnyi Lane, on the corner, stood a tradesman and his wife, a peasant woman, at two tables with wares they were selling: threads, braids, calico head scarves, and so on. They were also packing to go home, but lingered as they chatted with a passing acquaintance. This acquaintance was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or simply Lizaveta, as everyone called her, the younger sister of that very same old woman, Alyona Ivanovna, the widow of a collegiate registrar and moneylender, where Raskolnikov had been the day before when he had gone to pawn his watch and conduct his test. . . . He had known everything about this Lizaveta for some time now and was even slightly acquainted with her. She was a tall, awkward, timid, humble unmarried woman, almost feebleminded, thirty-five years old, living as a complete slave in her sister’s house, working for her day and night, trembling in her presence, even enduring beatings from her. She was standing deep in thought with a bundle in front of the tradesman and the peasant woman, listening to them attentively. They were explaining something to her with particular passion. When Raskolnikov suddenly caught sight of her, some sort of strange feeling, similar to deepest astonishment, seized him, even though there was nothing astonishing about the meeting.","It was about nine o’clock when he crossed the Haymarket. All the traders at their tables, barrows, shops, or stalls were shutting up shop, taking down and packing up their wares, and—like their customers—going home. Crowds of costermongers, rag-and-bone-men and the like, had gathered beside the food stalls at street level, or in the foul, stinking courtyards of the Haymarket houses, or—most of them—by the drinking dens. Raskolnikov used to seek out those particular places, and all the little alleys around them, when he wandered aimlessly out onto the streets. Here his rags didn’t attract supercilious glances, and he could walk about looking just as he pleased without scandalizing anyone. Right on the corner of K—— Alley* a townsman and his wife had set up two stalls selling thread, laces, cotton handkerchiefs, and the like. They, too, were getting ready to go home, but had stopped to talk to a friend who had just turned up. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or simply Lizaveta as everyone called her, the younger sister of that same old Aliona Ivanovna, Collegiate Registrar’s widow and moneylender, whom Raskolnikov had gone to see yesterday in order to pawn his watch and carry out his rehearsal. He had long known all about this Lizaveta, and even she knew him a little. She was a tall, gangling girl, quiet and timid, almost simple-minded; she was thirty-five years old and the complete slave of her sister, for whom she worked night and day, trembling with fear of her and even suffering beatings from her. She was standing beside the stallholder and his wife, carrying her bundle and listening carefully and doubtfully to what they said. They were explaining something to her very heatedly. When Raskolnikov suddenly caught sight of her, he was seized with a strange feeling, a sort of profound astonishment, although there was nothing astonishing about this meeting.","It was about nine o’clock when he crossed the Haymarket. At the tables and the barrows, at the booths and the stores, all the market people were closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their wares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag-pickers and scroungers of all kinds were crowding round the eateries and especially the taverns in the dirty and stinking courtyards of the Haymarket. Raskolnikov preferred this place and all the neighboring alleys when he wandered aimlessly in the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention, and one could walk about in anything without scandalizing people. At the corner of K____ Alley15 a huckster and his wife had two tables set out with ribbons, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, &c. They, too, had got up to go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just come up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or simply, as everyone called her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Aliona Ivanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his watch and make his experiment . . . He already knew all about Lizaveta and she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was a complete slave to her sister, worked for her day and night, went in fear and trembling of her, and even suffered beatings from her. She was standing with a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and doubtfully. They were explaining something to her especially heatedly. The moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing astonishing about this meeting."

"Порфирий Петрович перевел на минутку дух. Он так и сыпал, не уставая, то бессмысленно пустые фразы, то вдруг пропускал какие-то загадочные словечки и тотчас же опять сбивался на бессмыслицу. По комнате он уже почти бегал, все быстрей и быстрей передвигая свои жирные ножки, все смотря в землю, засунув правую руку за спину, а левою беспрерывно помахивая и выделывая разные жесты, каждый раз удивительно не подходившие к его словам. Раскольников вдруг заметил, что, бегая по комнате, он раза два точно как будто останавливался подле дверей, на одно мгновение, и как будто прислушивался… «Ждет он, что ли, чего-нибудь?»","Porfiry Petrovich took a breath for a moment. He kept pouring out, without getting tired, now meaninglessly empty phrases, then suddenly missing some mysterious little words and immediately again strayed into nonsense. He was almost running around the room, moving his fat legs faster and faster, still looking at the ground, putting his right hand behind his back, and with his left he was constantly waving and making different gestures, each time surprisingly not suited to his words. Raskolnikov suddenly noticed that, as he was running around the room, he seemed to stop a couple of times near the door, for a moment, and seemed to be listening... ""Is he waiting for something?""","Porfiry Petrovich caught his breath for a moment. He had been spurting these empty, meaningless phrases without stop, suddenly dropping in some enigmatic words, then wandering off into nonsense again. He was now almost running around the room, moving his stout little legs faster and faster, looking down at the floor, his right hand thrust behind his back, his left constantly waving about, executing various gestures, each time astonishingly ill-suited to his words. Raskolnikov suddenly noticed that, as he ran about the room, he paused a few times, as it were, next to the door for a moment, and seemed to be listening. . . . “Is he expecting something?”","Porfiry Petrovich paused a moment to get his breath. He had been rattling on tirelessly, mostly pouring out empty phrases but suddenly letting slip a few enigmatic words, only to relapse back into his meaningless patter. By now he was almost running around the room, his podgy little legs going faster and faster, his eyes fixed on the ground, his right hand shoved behind his back while his left waved this way and that, making all sorts of gestures that were always astonishingly inappropriate to whatever he was saying. Raskolnikov suddenly noticed that as he ran about the room, it almost looked as if he had paused by the door a couple of times, just for an instant, and listened… ‘Can he be expecting something?’","Porfiry Petrovich paused for breath. He had simply babbled on uttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and again reverting to incoherence. He was almost running around the room, moving his fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his right hand behind his back, while with his left making gestures that bore extraordinarily little relation to his words.

"«Потому что это дело очевидное, – бормотал он про себя, ухмыляясь и злобно торжествуя заранее успех своего решения. – Нет, мамаша, нет, Дуня, не обмануть меня вам!.. И еще извиняются, что моего совета не попросили и без меня дело решили! Еще бы! Думают, что теперь уж и разорвать нельзя, а посмотрим – льзя или нельзя! Отговорка-то какая капитальная: „уж такой, дескать, деловой человек Петр Петрович, такой деловой человек, что и жениться-то иначе не может как на почтовых, чуть не на железной дороге“. Нет, Дунечка, все вижу и знаю, о чем ты со мной много– то говорить собираешься; знаю и то, о чем ты всю ночь продумала, ходя по комнате, и о чем молилась перед Казанскою божией матерью, которая у мамаши в спальне стоит. На Голгофу-то тяжело всходить. Гм… Так, значит, решено уж окончательно: за делового и рационального человека изволите выходить, Авдотья Романовна, имеющего свой капитал (уже имеющего свой капитал, это солиднее, внушительнее), служащего в двух местах и разделяющего убеждения новейших наших поколений (как пишет мамаша) и, «кажется, доброго», как замечает сама Дунечка. Это кажется всего великолепнее! И эта же Дунечка за это же кажется замуж идет!.. Великолепно! Великолепно!..","“Because this matter is obvious,” he muttered to himself, grinning and viciously triumphing in advance of the success of his decision. - No, mother, no, Dunya, you cannot deceive me! .. And they also apologize that they did not ask for my advice and decided the matter without me! Still would! They think that now it’s impossible to break it, but let's see if it’s good or not! What a fundamental excuse: “he’s such a businessman, Pyotr Petrovich, such a businessman, that he cannot marry otherwise than at the post office, almost on the railroad”. No, Dunechka, I see everything and I know what you are going to talk a lot about with me; I also know what you thought about all night, walking around the room, and about which you prayed in front of the Kazan Mother of God, who is standing in your mother's bedroom. It's hard to climb Golgotha. Hmm ... So, it has been decided finally: if you please marry a businesslike and rational person, Avdotya Romanovna, who has his own capital (already having his own capital, this is more solid, more impressive), serving in two places and sharing the beliefs of our newest generations (as mother writes ) and, “it seems kind,” as Dunechka herself notes. This seems to be the greatest! And this same Dunechka seems to marry for this! .. Great! Fabulous!..","“Because this matter is obvious,” he muttered to himself, smirking and maliciously celebrating in advance the triumph of his decision. “No, Mama, no Dunya, you can’t deceive me! And what makes it even worse, they apologize for not asking my advice and for deciding the matter without me! I’ll say! They think it’s impossible to break it off now; we’ll see if it’s possible or not! What a splendid excuse: ‘ Petr Petrovich, they say, is such a businesslike man that he can’t possibly get married in any other way than in a hurry, almost en route on a train.’ No, Dunya, I can see everything, and I know what those many things are that you want to talk over with me; I also know what you worried about all night, pacing the room, and what you prayed about before the icon of Our Lady of Kazan,* the one that Mama has in her bedroom. It’s a steep climb to Golgotha.† Hmm . . . so, in other words, it’s been decided once and for all: you’re pleased, Avdotya Romanovna, to marry that practical, rational man who’s amassed his capital (who’s already amassed his capital; that’s more impressive, more imposing), who’s working in two places, who shares the convictions of our younger generation (as Mama writes), and who ‘seems to be a kind man,’ as Dunya herself says. That word seems is the most splendid of all! And this same Dunechka is planning to marry that seems! Splendid! Splendid!","‘The whole thing’s obvious,’ he muttered to himself with a sneer, feeling a vicious sense of triumph at the anticipated success of his decision. ‘ No, Mamasha, no, Dunia, you won’t hoodwink me!… And they’re even apologizing for not asking my advice, but settling the thing without me! Of course they would! They think it’s too late to break it off now; we’ll see if it’s too late or not! And what a brilliant excuse: “He’s such a businesslike man, Piotr Petrovich, such a businesslike man that there’s no way he can get married except on the mail-coach, practically on the railway!” No, Dunechka, I see it all, I know what a lot you want to tell me; and I know what it was you were thinking about all night, pacing up and down the room, and what you were praying about to Our Lady of Kazan* who stands in Mamasha’s bedroom. It’s a hard climb, up to Golgotha. * Hm… So, it’s firmly decided then: you, Avdotya Romanovna, are consenting to marry a businesslike and sensible man, a man who has his own capital (who already has his own capital—that sounds more solid and impressive), who has two jobs, and shares the convictions of our younger generations (as Mamasha writes), and seems to be kind, as Dunechka herself remarks. That seems to be is most priceless of all! And this same Dunechka is going to marry this same seems to be! Priceless!","“The thing is perfectly clear,” he muttered to himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his decision. “No, Mother, no, Dunia, you won’t deceive me! And then they apologize for not asking my advice and for making the decision without me! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and can’t be broken off; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse: ‘ Peter Petrovich is such a busy man, such a busy man that even his wedding has to be rushed, almost express. ’ No, Dunechka, I see it all and I know what that much is that you want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when you walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before the Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother’s bedroom. Bitter is the ascent to Golgotha9 . . . Hm . . . So it is finally settled; you have determined to marry a rational business man, Avdotia Romanovna, one who has a fortune (has already made his fortune, that is so much more solid and impressive), a man who holds two government posts and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and who ‘seems to be kind,’ as Dunechka herself observes.

"Действительно, минут через пять Лебезятников возвратился с Сонечкой. Та вошла в чрезвычайном удивлении и, по обыкновению своему, робея. Она всегда робела в подобных случаях и очень боялась новых лиц и новых знакомств, боялась и прежде, еще с детства, а теперь тем более… Петр Петрович встретил ее «ласково и вежливо», впрочем с некоторым оттенком какой-то веселой фамильярности, приличной, впрочем, по мнению Петра Петровича, такому почтенному и солидному человеку, как он, в отношении такого юного и в некотором смысле интересного существа. Он поспешил ее «ободрить» и посадил за стол, напротив себя. Соня села, посмотрела кругом – на Лебезятникова, на деньги, лежавшие на столе, и потом вдруг опять на Петра Петровича, и уже не отрывала более от него глаз, точно приковалась к нему. Лебезятников направился было к двери. Петр Петрович встал, знаком пригласил Соню сидеть и остановил Лебезятникова в дверях.","Indeed, after about five minutes Lebeziatnikov returned with Sonechka. She entered in extreme surprise and, as usual, shy. She was always shy in such cases and was very afraid of new faces and new acquaintances, she had been afraid before, since childhood, and now even more so... however, in the opinion of Pyotr Petrovich, such a respectable and respectable person as he is, in relation to such a young and in a sense interesting being. He hurried to “encourage” her and seated her at the table opposite him. Sonya sat down, looked around - at Lebezyatnikov, at the money lying on the table, and then suddenly again at Pyotr Petrovich, and no longer took her eyes off him, as if riveted to him. Lebeziatnikov started towards the door. Pyotr Petrovich got up, motioned for Sonya to sit down, and stopped Lebezyatnikov at the door.","As a matter of fact, about five minutes later, Lebezyatnikov returned with Sonechka. She entered in extreme surprise and, as was her usual state, very timidly. She was always timid in similar circumstances and was very afraid of new people and new acquaintances; she’d been afraid even before, from childhood, and was now all the more so. . . . Petr Petrovich greeted her “in a friendly and polite manner,” however, with a certain hint of cheerful familiarity, which, in his opinion, was appropriate for such an esteemed and solid person as he was, in relation to such a young and interesting (in a certain sense) creature as Sonya. He hastened to “reassure” her and seated her at the table opposite himself. Sonya sat down, looked around—at Lebezyatnikov, at the money lying on the table, at Petr Petrovich again, and then didn’t take her eyes off him, as if her gaze were riveted to him. Lebezyatnikov started to head for the door. Petr Petrovich stood up, indicated that Sonya should stay where she was, and stopped Lebezyatnikov in the doorway.","And indeed, some five minutes later Lebeziatnikov returned with Sonechka. She was utterly astonished, and as usual entered the room timidly. She was always scared in such situations, and very frightened by new faces and new acquaintances; she had been fearful ever since she was a child, and now was even more so. Piotr Petrovich greeted her in a ‘courteous and friendly manner’, though with a hint of good-humoured familiarity, appropriate in his opinion for a respectable gentleman of such solid worth as himself, in the presence of such a young and in a certain sense interesting creature. He hastened to ‘reassure’ her, and sat her down opposite him at the table. Sonia sat down and looked round—at Lebeziatnikov, at the money on the table, and then suddenly back at Piotr Petrovich; after that she looked fixedly at him and never took her eyes off him. Lebeziatnikov moved towards the door, but Piotr Petrovich stood up, gestured to Sonia to stay seated, and stopped Lebeziatnikov in the doorway.","Five minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. She came in very surprised and overwhelmed with shyness as usual. She was always shy in such circumstances and was always afraid of new people; she had been as a child and was even more so now . . . Peter Petrovich met her “politely and affably,” but with a certain shade of bantering informality which in his opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight in dealing with a creature as young and as interesting as she. He swiftly “reassured” her and made her sit down facing him at the table. Sonia sat down, looked around her—at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes lying on the table and then again at Peter Petrovich and her eyes remained riveted to his face. Lebeziatnikov was moving towards the door. Peter Petrovich indicated to Sonia that she should remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov."

"Вдруг, с некоторым шумом, весьма молодцевато и как-то особенно повертывая с каждым шагом плечами, вошел офицер, бросил фуражку с кокардой на стол и сел в кресла. Пышная дама так и подпрыгнула с места, его завидя, и с каким-то особенным восторгом принялась приседать; но офицер не обратил на нее ни малейшего внимания, а она уже не смела больше при нем садиться. Это был помощник квартального надзирателя, с горизонтально торчавшими в обе стороны рыжеватыми усами и с чрезвычайно мелкими чертами лица, ничего, впрочем, особенного, кроме некоторого нахальства, не выражавшими. Он искоса и отчасти с негодованием посмотрел на Раскольникова: слишком уж на нем был скверен костюм, и, несмотря на все принижение, все еще не по костюму была осанка; Раскольников по неосторожности слишком прямо и долго посмотрел на него, так что тот даже обиделся.","Suddenly, with some noise, very bravely and somehow especially turning his shoulders with every step, an officer entered, threw his cap with a cockade on the table and sat down in an armchair. The gorgeous lady jumped up from her place, seeing him, and with some special delight began to squat; but the officer did not pay the slightest attention to her, and she no longer dared to sit down with him. He was the assistant to the district overseer, with a reddish mustache sticking out horizontally on both sides and with extremely small features, however, nothing special, except for a certain insolence, which did not express. He looked sideways and partly with indignation at Raskolnikov: his suit was too nasty, and, despite all the humiliation, his posture was still unsuitable; Raskolnikov, inadvertently, looked at him too directly and for a long time, so that he was even offended.","All of a sudden, an officer entered, raucously strutting and swaggering in an extremely sprightly way, threw his cockaded cap on the table, and sat down in an armchair. Upon seeing him, the elegant lady immediately jumped up and curtsied to him with great gusto. While the officer didn’t pay her the least bit of attention, she dared not remain seated in his presence any longer. He was a lieutenant, the police superintendent’s assistant, and had a reddish mustache protruding horizontally in both directions and extremely fine facial features, expressing nothing whatsoever, however, except a certain insolence. He regarded Raskolnikov out of the corner of his eye, in part with indignation: his apparel was too disgraceful and, in spite of all his wretchedness, his behavior didn’t fit his dress; Raskolnikov, with a lack of care, stared at him so directly and for so long that the officer felt offended.","Suddenly an officer strode noisily into the room, with a most dashing air and an odd jerky swagger of his shoulders. He tossed his cockaded cap onto the table and seated himself in an armchair. The overdressed lady started up as soon as she saw him, and began curtseying apparently with great delight, but the officer paid her not the slightest attention. She no longer dared to sit down again in his presence. He was a lieutenant, the district police inspector’s assistant. * He wore a sandy-coloured moustache that stuck out horizontally on both sides of his face, and his features were particularly delicate, though they expressed nothing much beyond a certain insolence. He cast a sidelong, somewhat indignant glance at Raskolnikov—whose clothes were really excessively shabby, and yet whose bearing, though humble, had a dignity that belied his dress. Without meaning to, Raskolnikov had eyed him too long and hard, and the officer had actually taken offence.","All at once, with some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of his shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and sat down in an easy-chair. The small lady really skipped from her seat when she saw him, and started curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the officer did not take the slightest notice of her, and she did not venture to sit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his face, with extremely small features that expressed nothing much except insolence. He looked sideways and rather indignantly at Raskolnikov; he was so badly dressed, and in spite of his humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his clothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look at him, and he felt offended."

"Но он не мог выразить ни словами, ни восклицаниями своего волнения. Чувство бесконечного отвращения, начинавшее давить и мутить его сердце еще в то время, как он только шел к старухе, достигло теперь такого размера и так ярко выяснилось, что он не знал, куда деться от тоски своей. Он шел по тротуару как пьяный, не замечая прохожих и сталкиваясь с ними, и опомнился уже в следующей улице. Оглядевшись, он заметил, что стоит подле распивочной, в которую вход был с тротуара по лестнице вниз, в подвальный этаж. Из дверей, как раз в эту минуту, выходили двое пьяных и, друг друга поддерживая и ругая, взбирались на улицу. Долго не думая, Раскольников тотчас же спустился вниз. Никогда до сих пор не входил он в распивочные, но теперь голова его кружилась, и к тому же палящая жажда томила его. Ему захотелось выпить холодного пива, тем более что внезапную слабость свою он относил и к тому, что был голоден. Он уселся в темном и грязном углу, за липким столиком, спросил пива и с жадностию выпил первый стакан. Тотчас же все отлегло, и мысли его прояснели. «Все это вздор, – сказал он с надеждой, – и нечем тут было смущаться! Просто физическое расстройство! Один какой-нибудь стакан пива, кусок сухаря – и вот, в один миг, крепнет ум, яснеет мысль, твердеют намерения! Тьфу, какое все это ничтожество!..» Но, несмотря на этот презрительный плевок, он глядел уже весело, как будто внезапно освободясь от какого-то ужасного бремени, и дружелюбно окинул глазами присутствующих. Но даже и в эту минуту он отдаленно предчувствовал, что вся эта восприимчивость к лучшему была тоже болезненная.","But he could not express either words or exclamations of his excitement. The feeling of endless disgust, which had begun to crush and trouble his heart even while he was just walking to the old woman, had now reached such a size and it became so vividly clear that he did not know where to go from his melancholy. He walked along the sidewalk like a drunk, not noticing passers-by and colliding with them, and came to his senses in the next street. Looking around, he noticed that he was standing next to the tavern, to which the entrance was from the sidewalk down the stairs to the basement floor. At that very moment, two drunks came out of the door and, supporting and scolding each other, climbed into the street. Without thinking for a long time, Raskolnikov immediately went downstairs. He had never entered the taverns before, but now his head was spinning, and besides, a burning thirst tormented him. He wanted to drink cold beer, especially since he attributed his sudden weakness to the fact that he was hungry. He sat down in a dark and dirty corner, at a sticky table, asked for a beer and eagerly drank the first glass. At once everything was relieved, and his thoughts cleared up. “All this is nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there was nothing to be embarrassed about! Just a physical disorder! One glass of beer, a piece of biscuit - and, in an instant, the mind grows stronger, the thought becomes clear, the intentions harden! Ugh, how insignificant all this is! .. ”But, despite this contemptuous spit, he looked already merrily, as if suddenly freed from some terrible burden, and looked around the audience in a friendly manner. But even at that moment he had a distant presentiment that all this susceptibility to the best was also painful.","But he couldn’t express his agitation, either in words or exclamations. The feeling of infinite revulsion that had begun to oppress and torment his heart as he’d been coming to see the old woman had now reached such proportions and was so palpable that he didn’t know where to hide from his anguish. He walked along the sidewalk like a drunk, without noticing the passersby, and bumping into them; he came to his senses only at the next street. After looking around, he saw that he was standing next to a tavern, the entrance to which was down a staircase leading from the street level, into the cellar. Just at that moment, two drunks emerged from the door, supporting each other and cursing, and climbed up to the street. Without much thought, Raskolnikov went right down the stairs. He’d never frequented taverns before, but now his head was spinning; besides, he was suffering from a burning thirst. He felt like drinking a cold beer, all the more so since he attributed his sudden weakness to the fact that he was hungry. He sat down at a sticky table in a dark, dirty corner, ordered a beer, and gulped down the first glass. Everything receded immediately, and his thoughts became clear. “It’s all rubbish,” he said hopefully. “There’s no reason to get so distraught! It was merely physical upset! One glass of beer, a piece of rusk,† and then, in a minute, my mind grows strong, my thoughts grow clear, and my intentions are reinforced! Ugh, what nonsense it all is!” In spite of this contemptuous disdain, he seemed cheerful already, as if suddenly liberated from some terrible burden, and he cast his eyes amicably over those present. But even at that moment he had a distant premonition that all his assurance of better times was also morbid.","But neither words nor outbursts could do justice to his inner turmoil. The feeling of utter disgust that had begun to oppress and torment him earlier, even when he was on his way to the old woman, had now grown so sharp and powerful that he didn’t know where to hide from his anguish. He walked along the pavement like a drunken man, not seeing the passers-by, bumping into them, and only came to himself in the next street. Looking around him, he found that he was close to a drinking den,* with steps leading down from the street to the basement. Just at that moment two drunks came out and mounted the stairs to the street, propping each other up and swearing. On the spur of the moment, Raskolnikov went straight down the steps. He had never been in a drinking den before, but just now his head was spinning and he was tormented by a burning thirst. He felt he needed a cold beer, particularly as he ascribed his sudden weakness to hunger. He sat down in a dark, dirty corner by a sticky little table and ordered some beer. He drank down the first glass greedily. He felt better at once, and now he could think more clearly. ‘ That’s all nonsense,’ he said hopefully. ‘I didn’t need to get so anxious! It was just physical weakness. All it takes is one glass of beer and a piece of dry toast—and there you are, your mind is stronger straight away , your thoughts are clearer, you know what it is you want. Pah, how petty it all is!…’ Despite his exclamation of scorn, he was looking cheerful now, as if he had suddenly shaken off some terrible burden, and he cast a friendly glance at the other customers. Yet even at that moment he had a faint premonition that all these optimistic feelings were themselves no more than the expression of a pathological state.","But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the pavement like a drunken man, oblivious of the passersby, and jostling against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next street. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement. At that instant two drunken men came out of the door and, abusing and supporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Until that moment he had never been into a tavern, but now he felt dizzy and was tormented by a burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his sudden weakness to hunger. He sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful. At once he felt relief; and his thoughts became clear. “All that’s nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there is nothing in it all to worry about! It’s simply physical weakness. Just a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread—and in one moment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Pah, how utterly petty it all is!” But, though he spat this out so scornfully, he was by now looking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed round in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also not normal."

"Стараниями чиновника дело это уладилось, даже городовой помогал переносить Катерину Ивановну. Внесли ее к Соне почти замертво и положили на постель. Кровотечение еще продолжалось, но она как бы начинала приходить в себя. В комнату вошли разом, кроме Сони, Раскольников и Лебезятников, чиновник и городовой, разогнавший предварительно толпу, из которой некоторые провожали до самых дверей. Полечка ввела, держа за руки, Колю и Леню, дрожавших и плакавших. Сошлись и от Капернаумовых: сам он, хромой и кривой, странного вида человек с щетинистыми, торчком стоящими волосами и бакенбардами; жена его, имевшая какой-то раз навсегда испуганный вид, и несколько их детей, с одеревенелыми от постоянного удивления лицами и с раскрытыми ртами. Между всею этою публикой появился вдруг и Свидригайлов. Раскольников с удивлением посмотрел на него, не понимая, откуда он явился, и не помня его в толпе.","Through the efforts of the official, this matter was settled, even the policeman helped transfer Katerina Ivanovna. They carried her to Sonya almost dead and laid her on the bed. The bleeding was still going on, but she seemed to be starting to come to her senses. In addition to Sonya, Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov, an official and a policeman entered the room at once, having previously dispersed the crowd, some of which were escorted to the very doors. Polechka led Kolya and Lenya in, holding hands, trembling and crying. They also agreed from the Kapernaumovs: he himself, lame and crooked, a strange-looking man with bristly, upright hair and sideburns; his wife, who had some kind of frightened look once and for all, and several of their children, with faces stiff from constant surprise and with open mouths. Among all this audience, Svidrigailov suddenly appeared. Raskolnikov looked at him in surprise, not understanding where he came from, and not remembering him in the crowd.","This was organized with the civil servant’s efforts; even the policeman helped carry Katerina Ivanovna. They brought her to Sonya’s room almost dead and laid her on the bed. She kept losing blood but was beginning to regain consciousness. Besides Sonya, Raskolnikov and Lebezyatnikov, the civil servant, and the policeman who had dispersed the crowd, others entered the room; several people had accompanied them to the doorway. Polechka led the way, holding Kolya and Lyonya by the hand, both of whom were trembling and crying. People also gathered from the Kapernaumovs’ apartment, including Kapernaumov himself, lame and blind in one eye, a strange-looking man with bristling hair and whiskers standing up straight; his wife, who always had a frightened look; and several of his children, their expressions fixed in constant astonishment and their mouths wide open. Suddenly Svidrigaylov appeared amidst this large crowd. Raskolnikov regarded him with surprise, not understanding where he had come from, and not recalling him in the crowd on the street.","With the official’s help they brought Katerina Ivanovna indoors; even the policeman helped carry her. They brought her to Sonia’s room more dead than alive, and laid her on the bed. The bleeding was continuing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Sonia, Raskolnikov, and Lebeziatnikov came in, with the official and the policeman, once he had chased the crowd away; people had followed them all the way to the door. Polechka came in holding Kolia and Lenia by the hand; they were trembling and crying. Some people from the Kapernaumovs’ flat came in too; there was the tailor himself, an odd-looking man, lame and hunchbacked, with side whiskers and bushy hair standing on end; his wife, who looked permanently scared; and several of their children, whose open-mouthed faces were set in expressions of constant surprise. And in the midst of all this crowd, Svidrigailov also turned up. Raskolnikov looked at him in amazement, not understanding where he had sprung from, since he didn’t remember seeing him in the street crowd.","Thanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Sonia’s room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was still flowing, but she seemed to be coming round. Raskolnikov, Lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed right up to the door. Polenka came in holding Kolia and Lida, who were trembling and weeping. Several people came in too from the Kapernaumovs’ room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his wife, a woman with a constantly scared expression, and several open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these, Svidrigailov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at him with surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having noticed him in the crowd."

Один там профессор, недавно умерший, ученый серьезный, вообразил, что так можно лечить. Основная идея его, что особенного расстройства в организме у сумасшедших нет, а что сумасшествие есть, так сказать, логическая ошибка, ошибка в суждении, неправильный взгляд на вещи. Он постепенно опровергал больного и, представьте себе, достигал, говорят, результатов!

His main idea is that there is no particular disorder in the body of madmen, but that madness is, so to speak, a logical error, an error in judgment, a wrong view of things.

And now I’ve come merely to say”—Dunya began to stand up—“that if, by any chance, you need me or will need me for anything . . . my whole life, or anything . . . just call me and I’ll come. Good-bye!”","‘My brother, I know everything now, everything. Dmitry Prokofich has told me everything and explained it all. You’re being persecuted and tormented on account of a foul and stupid suspicion… Dmitry Prokofich tells me that there’s no danger, and you’ve no need to be so terrified by it all. I don’t agree; I completely understand what a state you’re in, and that you may be permanently affected by your indignation. That’s what I’m afraid of. I don’t blame you, I daren’t blame you, for leaving us; so please forgive me for reproaching you about it earlier. I know that if I’d suffered as much as you have, I’d have turned my back on everyone too. I shan’t tell Mother about that, but I’ll keep telling her about you, and I’ll tell her from you that you’re going to come and see her very soon. Don’t distress yourself about her —I’ll make it all right with her; but don’t distress her either. Come and see her, at least once—remember she’s your mother! And now, all I’ve come to say’ (and Dunia began to get up from her chair) ‘is that if by any chance you ever need me, or if you need… my whole life, or anything… just call me and I’ll come. Goodbye!’","“Rodia, now I know everything, everything. Dmitri Prokofich has explained and told me about all of it. They are worrying and persecuting you with a stupid and contemptible suspicion . . . Dmitri Prokofich told me that there is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking at it with such horror. I don’t think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must be, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you. That’s what I am afraid of. As for your proposal to cut yourself off from us, I’m not judging you, I’m not going to judge you, and forgive me for having blamed you for it. I feel that, if I had a difficulty as great as that, I too would keep away from everyone. I shall tell mother nothing of this, but I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that you will come very soon. Don’t worry about her; I will set her mind at rest; but don’t you try her too much —come once at least; remember that she is your mother. And now I have come simply to say” (Dunia began to get up) “that if you should need me or should need . . . all my life or anything . . . call me, and I’ll come. Goodbye!”"
"– Вы много сказали любопытного о характере брата и… сказали беспристрастно. Это хорошо; я думала, вы перед ним благоговеете, – заметила Авдотья Романовна с улыбкой. – Кажется, и то верно, что возле него должна находиться женщина, – прибавила она в раздумье.","- You said a lot of curious things about the character of your brother and ... said impartially.

"– Покойник муж действительно имел эту слабость, и это всем известно, – так и вцепилась вдруг в него Катерина Ивановна, – но это был человек добрый и благородный, любивший и уважавший семью свою; одно худо, что по доброте своей слишком доверялся всяким развратным людям и уж бог знает с кем он не пил, с теми, которые даже подошвы его не стоили! Вообразите, Родион Романович, в кармане у него пряничного петушка нашли: мертво-пьяный идет, а про детей помнит.","“The deceased husband really had this weakness, and everyone knows it,” Katerina Ivanovna suddenly clung to him, “but he was a kind and noble man who loved and respected his family; one thing is bad, that out of his kindness he trusted too much in all sorts of depraved people, and God knows with whom he did not drink, with those who were not even worth his soles! Imagine, Rodion Romanovich, they found a gingerbread cockerel in his pocket: he walks dead drunk, but he remembers about the children.","“Indeed, my late husband did have that weakness, and everyone knew that,” said Katerina Ivanovna, pouncing on him in a flash. “But he was a kind and generous man who loved and respected his family; his one fault was that out of kindness he used to trust all sorts of depraved creatures; God knows who he used to drink with, people who weren’t even worth his shoe sole! Just imagine, Rodion Romano­vich, they found a gingerbread rooster in his pocket: he was dead drunk, but he was thinking about his children.”","‘My late husband did indeed have that weakness, as everyone knows,’ said Katerina Ivanovna, turning on him sharply; ‘but he was a kind and noble man who loved and respected his family; his only fault was that his kind heart led him to place too much trust in all sorts of dissolute people, and heaven only knows whom he didn’t drink with—people who weren’t fit to wipe his shoes! Imagine, Rodion Romanovich: they found a gingerbread cockerel in his pocket: he was walking about dead drunk, but he’d remembered the children.’","“My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows it,” Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, “but he was a kind and honorable man, who loved and respected his family. The worst of it was that his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he drank with people who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you believe it, Rodion Romanovich, they found a gin gerbread cockerel in his pocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget the children!”"
"Раскольников тотчас признал Катерину Ивановну. Это была ужасно похудевшая женщина, тонкая, довольно высокая и стройная, еще с прекрасными темно-русыми волосами и действительно с раскрасневшимися до пятен щеками. Оно ходила взад и вперед по своей небольшой комнате, сжав руки на груди, с запекшимися губами и неровно, прерывисто дышала. Глаза ее блестели как в лихорадке, но взгляд был резок и неподвижен, и болезненное впечатление производило это чахоточное и взволнованное лицо при последнем освещении догоравшего огарка, трепетавшем на лице ее. Раскольникову она показалась лет тридцати, и действительно была не пара Мармеладову… Входящих она не слыхала и не заметила; казалось, она была в каком-то забытьи, не слушала и не видела. В комнате было душно, но окна она не отворила; с лестницы несло вонью, но дверь на лестницу была не затворена; из внутренних помещений, сквозь непритворенную дверь, неслись волны табачного дыма, она кашляла, но дверь не притворяла. Самая маленькая девочка, лет шести, спала на полу, как-то сидя, скорчившись и уткнув голову в диван. Мальчик, годом старше ее, весь дрожал в углу и плакал. Его, вероятно, только что прибили. Старшая девочка, лет девяти, высокенькая и тоненькая, как спичка, в одной худенькой и разодранной всюду рубашке и в накинутом на голые плечи ветхом драдедамовом бурнусике, сшитом ей, вероятно, два года назад, потому что он не доходил теперь и до колен, стояла в углу подле маленького брата, обхватив его шею своею длинною, высохшею как спичка рукой. Она, кажется, унимала его, что-то шептала ему, всячески сдерживала, чтоб он как-нибудь опять не захныкал, и в то же время со страхом следила за матерью своими большими-большими темными глазами, которые казались еще больше на ее исхудавшем и испуганном личике. Мармеладов, не входя в комнату, стал в самых дверях на коленки, а Раскольникова протолкнул вперед. Женщина, увидев незнакомого, рассеянно остановилась перед ним, на мгновение очнувшись и как бы соображая: зачем это он вошел? Но, верно, ей тотчас же представилось, что он идет в другие комнаты, так как ихняя была проходная. Сообразив это и не обращая уже более на него внимания, она пошла к сенным дверям, чтобы притворить их, и вдруг вскрикнула, увидев на самом пороге стоящего на коленках мужа.","Raskolnikov immediately recognized Katerina Ivanovna. She was a terribly thin woman, thin, rather tall and slender, still with beautiful dark blond hair and indeed with flushed cheeks. Ono walked up and down her small room, her hands clasped on her chest, her lips parched, and breathing unevenly, irregularly. Her eyes glittered as if in a fever, but her gaze was sharp and motionless, and this consumptive and agitated face produced a painful impression in the last illumination of the burning cinder that trembled on her face. She seemed to Raskolnikov about thirty years old, and really was not a match for Marmeladov ... She did not hear or notice those entering; it seemed that she was in some kind of oblivion, did not listen and did not see. The room was stuffy, but she did not open the window; there was a stench from the stairs, but the door to the stairs was not closed; waves of tobacco smoke rushed from the interior through the open door, she coughed, but did not close the door. The smallest girl, about six years old, slept on the floor, somehow sitting, curled up and buried her head in the sofa. The boy, a year older than her, was trembling all over in the corner and crying. It probably just got nailed. The eldest girl, about nine years old, tall and thin as a match, in one slender shirt that was torn everywhere, and in a shabby Dra-Dad's burnusik thrown over her bare shoulders, which she probably had sewn two years ago, because it did not even reach her knees now, stood in the corner next to the little brother, clasping his neck with my long, dry hand like a match. She seemed to calm him down, whisper something to him, restrain him in every possible way so that he somehow didn’t whimper again, and at the same time with fear watched her mother with her big, big dark eyes, which seemed even more on her emaciated and frightened face. Marmeladov, without entering the room, knelt in the very doorway, and pushed Raskolnikov forward. The woman, seeing the stranger, absentmindedly stopped in front of him, waking up for a moment and as if realizing: why did he come in? But, surely, she immediately imagined that he was going into other rooms, since theirs was a checkpoint. Realizing this and no longer paying attention to him, she went to the hay doors to close them, and suddenly screamed when she saw her husband kneeling on the very threshold.","Raskolnikov recognized Katerina Ivanovna immediately. She was a terribly emaciated woman, thin, rather tall and elegant, with lovely dark brown hair still, and real red blotches on her cheeks. She paced back and forth in her little room, arms folded across her chest, lips parched, gasping unevenly for breath. Her eyes were shining as if she had a fever, but her glance was sharp and steady, and her consumptive and agitated face made a morbid impression in the last light of the flickering candle end quivering on her face. She seemed to Raskolnikov to be about thirty years old and was certainly no match for Marmeladov. . . . She didn’t hear and didn’t see the men entering; she seemed to be in some sort of stupor in which she neither saw nor heard anything. It was stuffy in the room, but she hadn’t opened the window; there was a stench emanating from the staircase, but the door stood open; waves of tobacco smoke wafted in from the inner rooms through the open door; she was coughing but hadn’t closed the door. The youngest girl, around six years old, was asleep on the floor, sitting up somehow, hunched over, her head resting on the sofa. The little boy, a year older than her, was trembling in the corner and crying. He’d probably just been beaten. The eldest daughter, around nine years old, was as tall and slim as a matchstick, wearing only a wretched, very tattered blouse, and draped over her bare shoulders a decrepit cotton shawl that had probably been made for her about two years ago, because now it didn’t even reach her knees; she stood in the corner next to her younger brother, embracing his neck with one long arm, desiccated as a matchstick. She seemed to be comforting him, whispering something to him, doing all she could so he wouldn’t start whimpering again, while at the same time she followed her mother with her very, very large dark eyes, which seemed even larger on her emaciated and frightened little face. Marmeladov, before entering the room, sank to his knees in the doorway, while he pushed Raskolnikov forward. The woman, noticing a stranger, paused distractedly in front of him; having returned to her senses momentarily, she seemed to be wondering why he’d come in. But most likely she imagined that he was heading into the other rooms, since theirs served as the passageway. Realizing this and not paying any more attention, she went to the hall door to close it; then, catching sight of her husband kneeling on the threshold, she suddenly screamed.","Raskolnikov recognized Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was quite a tall and graceful woman, thin and dreadfully wasted, still with a fine head of dark auburn hair, and she really did have hectic red patches on her cheeks. She was pacing up and down the little room, pressing her hands against her breast. Her breath came in broken gasps through her parched lips. There was a feverish glitter in her eyes, but her look was firm and steady. Her tense consumptive gaze, lit up by the last flickers of the dying candle that shimmered on her face, was most upsetting to see. Raskolnikov reckoned she must be about thirty years old, and indeed she was a most unsuitable wife for Marmeladov. She did not hear or notice the two when they came in; she seemed to be in a sort of stupor, deaf and blind to everything. The atmosphere was stuffy, but she had not opened the window; a foul smell rose up from the stairway, but the door to the landing had not been closed; billows of tobacco smoke blew in from the inner rooms through the open door, making her cough, but she did not close that door either. The youngest girl, aged about six, was sitting hunched up on the floor asleep, her face hidden in the sofa. A boy, a year older than her, was trembling and crying in the corner; no doubt he had just been beaten. The oldest girl, some nine years old, tall and matchstick-thin, stood by her little brother in the corner. She was wearing nothing but a thin and very tattered shift, with an ancient drap-de-dames cape flung over her bare shoulders; the cape must have been made for her two years ago, for now it didn’t even reach her knees. She had laid her long arm, thin as a dried-out stick, around the boy’s neck and seemed to be comforting him, whispering something to him and doing all she could to stop him whimpering again; at the same time she was anxiously watching her mother with her big, big dark eyes, which seemed even bigger in her emaciated and fearful little face. Without entering the room, Marmeladov got down on his knees right in the doorway, and pushed Raskolnikov in ahead of him. At the sight of this strange man, the woman stopped distractedly in front of him, seeming to come to her senses for a moment and ask herself—what was this man doing here? But she must have immediately concluded that he was going through to the other rooms, since this was a through room. At this realization she paid him no further attention, but went over to the entrance door to close it; and suddenly cried out when she saw her husband kneeling on the threshold.","Raskolnikov recognized Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was terribly emaciated, a rather tall, slim and graceful woman, with magnificent dark blond hair and indeed with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down in her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips were parched and her breathing came in irregular broken gasps. Her eyes glittered as in fever but looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for Marmeladov . . . She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in. She seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room was stuffy, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not close the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting curled up on the floor with her head against the sofa. A boy a year older stood crying and shaking in the corner. Probably he had just had a beating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin as a matchstick, wearing a worn and ragged shirt with an ancient wool wrap flung over her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees. She stood in the corner next to her little brother, her long arm, as dry as a matchstick, round her brother’s neck. She seemed to be trying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she could to keep him from whimpering again while at the same time her large dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened face, were watching her mother with fear. Marmeladov did not enter the door, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov in front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped absentmindedly facing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into the next room, since he had to pass through hers to get there. Having figured this out and taking no further notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the doorway."
"– И тебе не стыдно теперь, сестра? – спросил Раскольников.","""Aren't you ashamed now, sister?"" Raskolnikov asked.","“Aren’t you ashamed now, Dunya?” asked Raskolnikov.","‘And aren’t you ashamed now, sister?’ asked Raskolnikov.","“Aren’t you ashamed now, Dunia?” asked Raskolnikov."
"– Нет, я не говорил ей ни слова и даже не совсем уверен, дома ли она теперь? Впрочем, вероятно, дома. Она сегодня похоронила свою родственницу: не такой день, чтобы по гостям ходить. До времени я никому не хочу говорить об этом и даже раскаиваюсь отчасти, что вам сообщил. Тут малейшая неосторожность равняется уже доносу. Я живу вот тут, вот в этом доме, вот мы и подходим. Вот это дворник нашего дома; дворник очень хорошо меня знает; вот он кланяется; он видит, что я иду с дамой, и уж, конечно, успел заметить ваше лицо, а это вам пригодится, если вы очень боитесь и меня подозреваете. Извините, что я так грубо говорю. Сам я живу от жильцов. Софья Семеновна живет со мною стена об стену, тоже от жильцов. Весь этаж в жильцах. Чего же вам бояться, как ребенку?

For the time being, I do not want to tell anyone about this, and I even regret partly that I told you. Here the slightest negligence is already equal to a denunciation. I live right here, right in this house, here we come. Here is the janitor of our house; the janitor knows me very well; here he bows; he sees that I am walking with a lady, and, of course, he has managed to notice your face, and this will be useful to you if you are very afraid and suspect me. Sorry for being so rude. I myself live from tenants. Sofya Semyonovna lives with me wall to wall, also from tenants. The entire floor is occupied. What are you afraid of as a child? Or am I really that scary?","“No, I haven’t said a word to her, and I’m not even sure she’s home now. However, she probably is. She buried her stepmother today: it’s not the sort of day to go visiting. Until the right time comes, I don’t want to say anything to anyone; I’m even a little sorry that I told you. Here the least carelessness is equivalent to denunciation. I live close by, in this house we’re approaching. Here’s the caretaker of our building; he knows me very well; he’s bowing to us; he sees that I’m coming with a lady, and, of course, he’s managed to observe your face; that will serve you well if you’re afraid of me and suspicious. Forgive me for speaking so crudely. I myself am renting a room from lodgers. Sofiya Semyonovna lives on the other side of the wall, where she’s also renting from lodgers. All the rooms on the floor are being rented. Why are you frightened like a little child? Or am I really so frightening?”","‘No, I haven’t said a word to her; in fact I’m not entirely sure if she’s at home now. Although she probably is. She buried her relative today; it’s not the sort of day to go visiting. I don’t want to tell anybody about all this for the time being, in fact I’m a bit sorry that I told you. The least bit of carelessness here would amount to denouncing him. I live right here, in this building we’re coming up to. Here’s the house porter; he knows me very well, look, he’s bowing to me ; he can see that I’m walking with a lady, and of course he’s had time to notice your face; that’ll be useful for you, if you’re very afraid and suspicious of me. I’m sorry to be putting it all so crudely. I’m living in a room sublet by tenants here. Sofia Semionovna lives in the next-door room, she’s renting from tenants too. The whole floor is rented out. What is there to be so frightened of, as if you were a child? Am I really all that terrifying?’","“No, I have not said a word to her and I am not quite certain whether she is at home now. But most likely she is. She has buried her stepmother today: she is not likely to go out visiting people on a day like that. For the time being I don’t want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken to you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like this. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That’s the porter of our house—he knows me very well; you see, he’s bowing; he sees I’m coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse the fact that I’m putting things so coarsely. I haven’t got an apartment to myself; Sofia Semionovna’s room is next to mine—she lodges in the next apartment. The whole floor is let out to tenants. Why are you frightened? You look like a child. Am I really so terrible?”"

"– Чего дрыхнешь! – вскричала она, с отвращением смотря на него. Он приподнялся и сел, но ничего не сказал ей и глядел в землю.","- Why are you sleeping! She cried, looking at him in disgust.

"Но тем не менее ему опять-таки было ясно, что Соня с своим характером и с тем все-таки развитием, которое она получила, ни в каком случае не могла так оставаться. Все-таки для него составляло вопрос: почему она так слишком уже долго могла оставаться в таком положении и не сошла с ума, если уж не в силах была броситься в воду? Конечно, он понимал, что положение Сони есть явление случайное в обществе, хотя, к несчастию, далеко не одиночное и не исключительное. Но эта-то самая случайность, эта некоторая развитость и вся предыдущая жизнь ее могли бы, кажется, сразу убить ее при первом шаге на отвратительной дороге этой. Что же поддерживало ее? Не разврат же? Весь этот позор, очевидно, коснулся ее только механически; настоящий разврат еще не проник ни одною каплей в ее сердце: он это видел; она стояла перед ним наяву…","But nevertheless, it was again clear to him that Sonya, with her character and with the development that she had received, could under no circumstances remain like that. Still, the question for him was: why had she been able to remain in this position for so long and not gone mad if she was no longer able to throw herself into the water? Of course, he understood that Sonya's position was an accidental phenomenon in society, although, unfortunately, it was far from being isolated and not exceptional. But this very accident, this certain development and her whole previous life, it seems, could immediately kill her at the first step on this disgusting road. What kept her going? Isn't it debauchery? All this shame, obviously, touched her only mechanically; real debauchery had not yet penetrated a single drop into her heart: he saw it; she was right in front of him...","Yet it was clear to him once again that Sonya, with her character and the upbringing she had nonetheless received, could in no way stay as she was. Still the question remained for him: how could she have stayed in her present situation for so long and not lost her mind, if she wasn’t strong enough to throw herself into the water? Of course, he understood that Sonya’s position in society was accidental, although, unfortunately, not singular and not exceptional. But this very chance, this smattering of education, and all her previous life could have destroyed her at her very first step on this abominable path. What had supported her? It wasn’t the depravity. Why, this disgrace, obviously, had affected her only mechanically; not one drop of genuine disgrace had yet penetrated into her heart: he saw this; she stood before him in reality . . . “She has three ways she can go,” he thought.","But he also clearly saw that Sonia, with her character and the way she had been brought up in spite of everything, couldn’t possibly go on as she was. The question for him was still this: how had she managed to go on living as she had done, for so long, without going mad—since she didn’t have the strength to throw herself into the water? Of course he understood that Sonia’s situation in society was a matter of chance, though unfortunately far from a unique or exceptional one. But this very chance, this limited degree of upbringing she had received, and all her previous life, might have been expected to kill her at her very first step along that loathsome path. So what was it that sustained her? Not depravity, surely? For the shame of it seemed only to have touched her in a mechanical way; not one drop of corruption had yet found its way to her heart—he could see right through her. ‘There are three ways she could go,’ he thought.","But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and the amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any case remain the way she was. He was still confronted by the question of how could she have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind, since she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course he knew that Sonia’s position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not unique and not infrequent, in fact; but her exceptional nature, her tinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought, have killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her up—surely not depravity ? All that infamy had obviously only touched her mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her heart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him . . ."

"Он все прочел в одном ее взгляде. Стало быть, действительно у ней самой была уже эта мысль. Может быть, много раз и серьезно обдумывала она в отчаянии, как бы разом покончить, и до того серьезно, что теперь почти и не удивилась предложению его. Даже жестокости слов его не заметила (смысла укоров его и особенного взгляда его на ее позор она, конечно, тоже не заметила, и это было видимо для него). Но он понял вполне, до какой чудовищной боли истерзала ее, и уже давно, мысль о бесчестном и позорном ее положении. Что же, что же бы могло, думал он, до сих пор останавливать решимость ее покончить разом? И тут только понял он вполне, что значили для нее эти бедные, маленькие дети-сироты и эта жалкая, полусумасшедшая Катерина Ивановна, с своею чахоткой и со стуканием об стену головою.","He read everything in one glance. So, indeed, she herself had already had this idea. Perhaps many times she had thought seriously in despair about how to end it all at once, and so seriously that now she was almost not surprised at his proposal. She didn’t even notice the cruelty of his words (of course, she didn’t notice the meaning of his reproaches and his special look at her disgrace, and this was visible to him). But he fully understood to what monstrous pain she was tormented, and for a long time, by the thought of her dishonorable and shameful position. What, what could, he thought, still stop her determination to end it all at once? And only then did he fully understand what those poor, little orphans meant to her, and that pathetic, half-mad Katerina Ivanovna, with her consumption and banging her head against the wall.","He was able to understand everything in that one look.

But he understood completely how monstrously she was tormented, and had been for some time, by the thought of her dishonorable and shameful predicament. What, what on earth could possibly, he wondered, have impeded her resolve up to this point to end it all at once? And only then did he completely understand the meaning these poor little orphan children had for her, and the pitiful half-mad Katerina Ivanovna, with her consumption and her banging her head against the wall.","In that one glance of hers, he had read everything.

She didn’t even notice how cruel his words were (and of course she also hadn’t noticed the sense of his reproaches, nor his particular view of her shame; he could see that too). But he fully realized how excruciating, how unbearably painful, the thought of her dishonour and shame had always been for her. What on earth, he wondered, could have still prevented her from resolving to end it all? And only now did he fully realize how much these poor little orphan children meant to her, and that pitiful, half-crazed Katerina Ivanovna, with her consumption, beating her head against the wall.","He read it all in her face; so she must have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed the cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and his peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either, and that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long tortured her. “What, what,” he thought, “could have hindered her from putting an end to it?” Only then he realized what those poor little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna, tubercular and knocking her head against the wall, meant for Sonia."

"Напоминая теперь с горечью Дуне о том, что он решился взять ее, несмотря на худую о ней молву, Петр Петрович говорил вполне искренно и даже чувствовал глубокое негодование против такой «черной неблагодарности». А между тем, сватаясь тогда за Дуню, он совершенно уже был убежден в нелепости всех этих сплетен, опровергнутых всенародно самой Марфой Петровной и давно уже оставленных всем городишком, горячо оправдывавшим Дуню. Да он и сам не отрекся бы теперь от того, что все это уже знал и тогда. И тем не менее он все-таки высоко ценил свою решимость возвысить Дуню до себя и считал это подвигом. Выговаривая об этом сейчас Дуне, он выговаривал свою тайную, возлелеянную им мысль, на которую он уже не раз любовался, и понять не мог, как другие могли не любоваться на его подвиг. Явившись тогда с визитом к Раскольникову, он вошел с чувством благодетеля, готовящегося пожать плоды и выслушать весьма сладкие комплименты. И уж конечно, теперь, сходя с лестницы, он считал себя в высочайшей степени обиженным и непризнанным.","Now recalling with bitterness to Duna that he had decided to take her, despite the bad rumor about her, Pyotr Petrovich spoke quite sincerely and even felt deep indignation against such ""black ingratitude."" And meanwhile, when wooing Dunya at that time, he was already completely convinced of the absurdity of all these gossip, refuted publicly by Marfa Petrovna herself and long since abandoned by the whole town, ardently justifying Dunya. Yes, he himself would not deny now that he already knew all this even then. Nevertheless, he nevertheless highly appreciated his determination to elevate Dunya to himself and considered this a feat. Speaking about this now to Dunya, he uttered his secret thought, cherished by him, which he had admired more than once, and could not understand how others could not admire his feat. Appearing then on a visit to Raskolnikov, he entered with the feeling of a benefactor, preparing to reap the fruits and listen to very sweet compliments. And of course, now, descending the stairs, he considered himself in the highest degree offended and unrecognized.","Now, reminding Dunya with bitterness that he had decided to take her despite those nasty rumors about her, Petr Petrovich was speaking in complete sincerity and even feeling deep disgust toward such “black ingratitude.” Meanwhile, at the time he’d proposed to Dunya, he’d been completely convinced of the absurdity of all the rumors, which had been publicly refuted by Marfa Petrovna herself and long since discarded by the entire town, which had vindicated Dunya. And he himself would not now deny the fact that he’d known it all at the time. Nevertheless, he still highly valued his resolve to elevate Dunya to his own level and considered it a valiant feat. When he’d spoken about it to Dunya just now, he’d been expressing his secret, cherished thought, which he himself had admired more than once, and he couldn’t understand how other people could fail to admire his feat. When he’d paid his visit to Raskolnikov, he had entered with the feeling of a benefactor preparing to reap the fruits and hear extremely gratifying compliments. Now, of course, on his way down the stairs, he felt offended and unappreciated to the highest degree.","Just now, when he had bitterly reminded Dunia of how he had resolved to take her despite the bad rumours surrounding her, Piotr Petrovich had been speaking quite sincerely, and even feeling profound indignation at her ‘black ingratitude’. And yet when he had begun courting her, he had already been quite convinced of the absurdity of all that gossip, publicly refuted by Marfa Petrovna herself and long ago dismissed by everyone in town, who by now all hotly defended Dunia. He himself would never have denied that he had known all that at the time. And yet he set a high value on his determination to raise Dunia to his own level, and regarded it as something heroic. When he had said all this to Dunia during their meeting, he had been voicing a secret and cherished idea of his, which he had repeatedly admired in himself, and he could not understand how others could fail to be impressed by such a noble deed. When he had gone round to visit Raskolnikov, he had entered his room feeling like a benefactor about to reap the fruits of his generosity and to hear the most flattering expressions of gratitude. And now, of course, as he descended the stairs, he saw himself as having been roundly insulted, and his merits completely ignored.","When he had bitterly reminded Dunia that he had decided to take her in spite of various evil reports, Peter Petrovich had spoken with perfect sincerity and had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such “black ingratitude.” And yet, when he made Dunia his offer, he was fully aware of the groundlessness of all the gossip. The story had been contradicted in every quarter by Marfa Petrovna and was by then distrusted among all the townspeople, who were warm in Dunia’s defense. And he would not have denied that he knew all that at the time. Yet he still thought highly of his own resolution in lifting Dunia to his level and regarded it as something heroic. In speaking of it to Dunia, he had let out the secret feeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that others should fail to admire it too. He had called on Raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear pleasing flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he considered himself undeservedly injured and unrecognized."

Are you going somewhere?”","‘Rodia, I don’t know what’s up with you,’ she finally said. ‘All this time I’ve thought that you were simply fed up with us; but now I can see from all this that there’s some sort of great grief ahead of you, and that’s why you’re unhappy. I’ve seen it coming for ages, Rodia. Forgive me for talking about it, but I keep thinking about it and it keeps me awake at night. Your sister spent the whole of last night talking in her sleep, and she kept mentioning you. I heard a bit of it, but I couldn’t understand a thing. All this morning I felt as if I were walking to my execution—expecting something, feeling something in the air, and now here we are! Rodia, Rodia, where are you off to? Are you going away somewhere?’","“I don’t know what is wrong with you, Rodia,” she said at last. “I’ve been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see that there is great sorrow in store for you, and that’s why you are miserable. I’ve seen it coming for a long time, Rodia. Forgive me for speaking about it. I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. Your sister lay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you. I caught something, but I couldn’t make it out.

"– Н-ничего не допускается! – с жаром перебил Разумихин, – не вру!.. Я тебе книжки ихние покажу: все у них потому, что «среда заела», – и ничего больше! Любимая фраза! Отсюда прямо, что если общество устроить нормально, то разом и все преступления исчезнут, так как не для чего будет протестовать, и все в один миг станут праведными. Натура не берется в расчет, натура изгоняется, натуры не полагается! У них не человечество, развившись историческим, живым путем до конца, само собою обратится, наконец, в нормальное общество, а, напротив, социальная система, выйдя из какой-нибудь математической головы, тотчас же и устроит все человечество и в один миг сделает его праведным и безгрешным, раньше всякого живого процесса, без всякого исторического и живого пути! Оттого-то они так инстинктивно и не любят историю: «безобразия одни в ней да глупости» – и все одною только глупостью объясняется! Оттого так и не любят живого процесса жизни: не надо живой души! Живая душа жизни потребует, живая душа не послушается механики, живая душа подозрительна, живая душа ретроградна!

С одной логикой нельзя через натуру перескочить! Логика предугадает три случая, а их миллион! Отрезать весь миллион и все на один вопрос о комфорте свести! Самое легкое разрешение задачи! Соблазнительно ясно, и думать не надо! Главное – думать не надо! Вся жизненная тайна на двух печатных листках умещается!","“N-nothing is allowed!” - Razumikhin interrupted with fervor, - I'm not lying! .. I'll show you their books: they have everything because ""the environment is jammed"" - and nothing more! Favorite phrase! It follows directly that if society is arranged normally, then all crimes will disappear at once, since there will be nothing to protest for, and everyone will become righteous in an instant. Nature is not taken into account, nature is expelled, nature is not supposed to! With them, it is not humanity, having developed to the end in a historical, living way, that by itself will finally turn into a normal society, but, on the contrary, the social system, emerging from some mathematical head, will immediately arrange all of humanity and in an instant make it righteous and sinless, before any living process, without any historical and living path! That is why they so instinctively dislike history: ""there are only outrages and stupidities in it"" - and everything is explained by stupidity alone! That's why they don't like the living process of life: they don't need a living soul! The living soul will demand life, the living soul will not obey the mechanics, the living soul is suspicious, the living soul is retrograde! And here, even though it smells of carrion, you can make it out of rubber, but it’s not alive, but without will, but slave, it won’t rebel! And it turns out that everything has been reduced to just laying bricks and the arrangement of corridors and rooms in the phalanstery[40]! the phalanstere is ready, but your nature is not yet ready for the phalanstere, it wants to live, it has not yet completed the life process, it’s too early for the cemetery! With logic alone, one cannot jump over nature! Logic predicts three cases, and there are a million of them! Cut off the whole million and reduce everything to one question about comfort! The easiest solution to the problem! Seductively clear, and no need to think! The main thing is that you don't have to think! The whole secret of life fits on two printed sheets!","“Nothing else is permitted!” Razumikhin interrupted with passion. “I’m telling the truth! I’ll show you their books: they say it’s all because ‘the environment has ruined them’—and nothing else! It’s their favorite phrase! From there it follows that if society were to be organized normally, then all crimes would disappear instantly, since there’d be no reason to protest and everyone would immediately become righteous. Nature isn’t taken into account; nature’s banished; nature’s not allowed! According to them, it’s not humanity, developing historically along a living path to the end, which in and of itself turns into a normal society, but, on the contrary, the social system, emerging from some mathematical brain, that immediately organizes all humanity and in one moment renders it righteous and sinless, before any living progress, without any historical and living path! That’s why they instinctively don’t like history: they see only its ‘outrages and stupidity’—and everything ’s explained only by stupidity! That’s why they don’t like the living process of life itself: they don’t need a living soul! The living soul demands life; the living soul doesn’t heed the laws of mechanics; the living soul is suspect; the living soul is reactionary! Even if their social system can be made out of rubber and smells a bit like carrion—it’s still not alive, it has no will, it’s slavish, it doesn’t rebel! And the result is that all their labor goes only to laying bricks and arranging the corridors and rooms in a phalanstery.† The phalanstery’s built, but human nature still isn’t ready for the phalanstery; it wants life; it still hasn’t completed the living process; it’s too early for the cemetery! It’s impossible to leap over human nature by means of logic alone! Logic can anticipate three possibilities, but there are a million of them! Cut off the whole million and reduce everything to a question of comfort! That’s the simplest solution to the problem! It’s clearly tempting and one doesn’t have to think! The main point is—there’s no need to think! The entire secret of life fits on two sheets of printer’s paper!”","‘N-nothing else is admissible!’ Razumikhin interrupted him heatedly, ‘I’m not wrong!… I’ll show you their pamphlets— it’s all because people have been “corrupted by their environment”,* nothing else! That’s their favourite phrase! From which it follows that if society was properly organized, all crime would immediately disappear, since there would be nothing to protest about, and in an instant everyone would become law-abiding. They don’t take nature into account, they’ve banished nature, nature isn’t supposed to exist! They don’t see humanity developing along a historical, living pathway to the end, where it eventually evolves of its own accord into the perfect society; they see a social system generated in some sort of mathematician’s brain, which will instantly organize the whole of humanity and instantly make it righteous and virtuous, quicker than any living process, without any historical, living pathway! * That’s why they dislike history so instinctively—“there’s nothing there but infamy and stupidity”—and they explain everything on the basis of stupidity alone! That’s why they dislike the living process of life: they don’t want the living soul! The living soul will demand life; the living soul won’t obey mechanical laws; the living soul is an object of suspicion; the living soul is retrograde! Their own scheme may have a whiff of carrion, it may be made of India rubber—but at least it’s not alive, it has no will , it’s slavish and won’t rebel! And the result is, they’ve boiled it all down to how you lay the bricks and arrange the rooms and corridors in some phalanstery! * Very well, the phalanstery may be ready, but your human nature isn’t ready for this phalanstery , it wants life, it hasn’t yet accomplished its living process, it’s too early for the graveyard! Logic alone won’t bypass nature! Logic can envisage three possibilities—but there are a million of them! Cutting out all that million and reducing everything to the mere question of comfort! That’s the easiest solution to the problem! Temptingly clear-cut, and with no need to think! That’s the main thing—no need to think! The whole mystery of life fitted onto two pages of print!’","“Nothing is admitted,” Razumikhin interrupted with heat. “I’m not wrong. I’ll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them is ‘the influence of the environment,’ and nothing else. Their favorite phrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organized, crime will instantly cease to exist, since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in an instant. Human nature is not taken into account, it is excluded, it’s not supposed to exist! They don’t recognize that humanity has developed by a living historical process and will eventually become normal; they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organize all of humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker than any living process! That’s why they instinctively dislike history, ‘nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,’ and they explain it all as stupidity! That’s why they dislike the living process of life; they don’t want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul won’t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is backward! But what they want, though it smells of death and can be made of rubber, is at least not alive, has no will, is servile and won’t revolt! And it comes in the end to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning of rooms and passages in a commune! The commune is ready, but human nature isn’t ready for the commune —it needs life, it hasn’t completed its vital process, it’s too soon for the graveyard! You can’t skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three possibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce it all to a question of comfort! That’s the easiest solution to the problem!

"– Все об воскресении Лазаря, – отрывисто и сурово прошептала она и стала неподвижно, отвернувшись в сторону, не смея и как бы стыдясь поднять на него глаза. Лихорадочная дрожь ее еще продолжалась.

Прошло минут пять или более.","“All about the resurrection of Lazarus,” she whispered abruptly and sternly, and stood motionless, turning away, not daring and as if ashamed to raise her eyes to him.

Five minutes or more passed.","“That’s all there is about the resurrection of Lazarus,” she whispered abruptly and sternly; she remained motionless, turned to one side, not daring, as if ashamed, to raise her eyes and look at him.

"– Гонорарий! Всем пользуетесь! – Раскольников засмеялся. – Ничего, добреющий мальчик, ничего! – прибавил он, стукнув Заметова по плечу, – я ведь не назло, «а по всей то есь любови, играючи», говорю, вот как работник-то ваш говорил, когда он Митьку тузил, вот, по старухиному-то делу.","- Fee! Use everything! Raskolnikov laughed. “Nothing, good boy, nothing! he added, tapping Zametov on the shoulder.","“Your reward! You make the best use of everything!” Raskolnikov started laughing. “Never mind, my good fellow, never mind!” he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. “I’m not being mean, but ‘it’s out of love, playing,’ just like that workman said when he was punching Mitka, in the case of the old woman.”","‘Just a perk! Everything comes your way!’—Raskolnikov laughed. ‘Never mind, my fine lad, never mind!’ he added, clapping Zametov on the shoulder. ‘I didn’t mean any harm—it was “all friendly, just having a bit of fun”, as that workman told you when he was thumping Mitka back then, over that business of the old woman.’","“As a fee! You profit by everything!” Raskolnikov laughed, “it’s all right, my friend,” he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. “I’m not saying that because I’m angry, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that workman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of the old woman . . . ”"
"Он проснулся на другой день уже поздно, после тревожного сна, но сон не подкрепил его. Проснулся он желчный, раздражительный, злой и с ненавистью посмотрел на свою каморку. Это была крошечная клетушка, шагов в шесть длиной, имевшая самый жалкий вид с своими желтенькими, пыльными и всюду отставшими от стены обоями, и до того низкая, что чуть-чуть высокому человеку становилось в ней жутко, и все казалось, что вот-вот стукнешься головой о потолок. Мебель соответствовала помещению: было три старых стула, не совсем исправных, крашеный стол в углу, на котором лежало несколько тетрадей и книг; уже по тому одному, как они были запылены, видно было, что до них давно уже не касалась ничья рука; и, наконец, неуклюжая большая софа, занимавшая чуть не всю стену и половину ширины всей комнаты, когда-то обитая ситцем, но теперь в лохмотьях, и служившая постелью Раскольникову. Часто он спал на ней так, как был, не раздеваясь, без простыни, покрываясь своим старым, ветхим студенческим пальто и с одною маленькою подушкой в головах, под которую подкладывал все, что имел белья, чистого и заношенного, чтобы было повыше изголовье. Перед софой стоял маленький столик.","He woke up late the next day, after a disturbing sleep, but the sleep did not support him. He woke up bilious, irritable, angry and looked with hatred at his closet. It was a tiny cage, about six paces long, which had the most pitiful appearance with its yellow, dusty and everywhere wallpaper that had lagged behind the wall, and so low that a slightly tall man felt creepy in it, and everything seemed to be about bump your head against the ceiling. The furniture corresponded to the room: there were three old chairs, not entirely serviceable, a painted table in the corner, on which lay several notebooks and books; just by the way they were dusty, it was evident that no hand had touched them for a long time; and, finally, a clumsy large sofa, which occupied almost the entire wall and half the width of the entire room, once upholstered in chintz, but now in rags, and which served as Raskolnikov's bed. Often he slept on it as he was, without undressing, without a sheet, covered with his old, shabby student coat and with one small pillow in his head, under which he put everything he had, clean and worn out, so that the head was higher. There was a small table in front of the sofa.","It was already late in the day when he awoke after a disturbed sleep, but the sleep hadn’t fortified him. He woke up feeling aggravated, irritable, and spiteful and looked around his small space with contempt. It was a tiny closet of a room, some six paces long, and it had the most pitiful appearance, with dusty yellowish wallpaper peeling away in many places. The ceiling was so low that even a slightly tall man would find it unnerving, and it always seemed to him that at any moment he might bump his head against it. The furniture suited the room: there were three old chairs, not in good condition, and a painted table in the corner holding a few books and notebooks. A glance at even one volume, all covered in dust, would make it clear that it had been a while since anyone’s hand had touched these books. Finally, a large, ungainly sofa took up almost the entire wall and about half the width of the whole room; at one time it had been covered in chintz, but now it was in tatters and served as Raskolnikov’s bed. He often slept on it just as he was, without undressing, without a sheet, covering himself with his old shabby student’s overcoat, with one small pillow at the head of the bed, under which he would place all the linen he owned, both clean and dirty, so that his head was raised a bit. A small table stood in front of the sofa.","It was already late when he awoke next day, after a restless night. He felt no stronger for his sleep, and woke feeling queasy, irritable, and bad-tempered. He looked with loathing around his little room. It was a tiny cell about six paces long, and its dusty yellow wallpaper, peeling off the walls, gave it an abject appearance. It was so low that even a moderately tall person would have been uncomfortable, constantly feeling in danger of knocking his head against the ceiling. The furniture was no better than the room—there were three old chairs, in poor repair, and a painted table in the corner with a number of books and notebooks on it. The dust lay thick enough on them to show that they hadn’t been touched for a long time. And finally, there was a large rickety sofa occupying almost the whole length of one wall and half the width of the room itself. It had once been covered with chintz, of which nothing but rags remained now; it served as Raskolnikov’s bed. He would often sleep on it just as he was, without undressing, and with no sheet over him, covering himself with his ancient student’s overcoat* and with a single little pillow under his head. All his linen, both clean and soiled, was shoved under the pillow to raise it higher. In front of the sofa stood a little table.","HE WOKE UP LATE next day after a troubled sleep. But his sleep had not refreshed him; he woke up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked with hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty yellow paper peeling off the walls, and the ceiling was so low that a man of just a little more than average height was ill at ease in it and kept feeling every moment that he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a painted table in the corner on which lay a few books and notebooks; the dust alone that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long untouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed.

"– Он ничего и никогда сам об этой истории со мною не говорил, – осторожно отвечал Разумихин, – но я кой-что слышал от самой госпожи Зарницыной, которая тоже, в своем роде, не из рассказчиц, и что слышал, то, пожалуй, несколько даже и странно…","“He never said anything to me about this story himself,” Razumikhin answered cautiously, “but I heard something from Mrs. Zarnitsyna herself, who, too, is not one of the storytellers, and what I heard, perhaps, even a bit weird...","“He himself never told me a thing about that episode,” Razumikhin replied cautiously, “but I heard something about it from Mrs. Zarnitsyna herself, who’s also not the most communicative person.","‘He’s never said anything to me about that story,’ replied Razumikhin cautiously. ‘But I did hear something from Mrs Zarnitsyna herself; though she’s not a great talker either, and what I did hear was actually rather strange…’","“He has never spoken a word about that to me,” Razumikhin answered cautiously. “But I did hear something from Praskovia Pavlovna herself, though she is by no means a gossip.

"– То-то наплевать! Изверились, да и думаете, что я вам грубо льщу; да много ль вы еще и жили-то? Много ль понимаете-то? Теорию выдумал, да и стыдно стало, что сорвалось, что уж очень не оригинально вышло! Вышло-то подло, это правда, да вы-то все-таки не безнадежный подлец. Совсем не такой подлец! По крайней мере, долго себя не морочил, разом до последних столбов дошел. Я ведь вас за кого почитаю? Я вас почитаю за одного из таких, которым хоть кишки вырезай, а он будет стоять да с улыбкой смотреть на мучителей, – если только веру иль бога найдет. Ну, и найдите, и будете жить. Вам, во-первых, давно уже воздух переменить надо. Что ж, страданье тоже дело хорошее. Пострадайте. Миколка-то, может, и прав, что страданья хочет. Знаю, что не веруется, – а вы лукаво не мудрствуйте; отдайтесь жизни прямо, не рассуждая; не беспокойтесь, – прямо на берег вынесет и на ноги поставит. На какой берег? А я почем знаю? Я только верую, что вам еще много жить. Знаю, что вы слова мои как рацею теперь принимаете заученную; да, может, после вспомните, пригодится когда-нибудь; для того и говорю. Еще хорошо, что вы старушонку только убили. А выдумай вы другую теорию, так, пожалуй, еще и в сто миллионов раз безобразнее дело бы сделали! Еще бога, может, надо благодарить; почем вы знаете: может, вас бог для чего и бережет. А вы великое сердце имейте да поменьше бойтесь. Великого предстоящего исполнения-то струсили? Нет, тут уж стыдно трусить. Коли сделали такой шаг, так уж крепитесь. Тут уж справедливость. Вот исполните-ка, что требует справедливость. Знаю, что не веруете, а, ей-богу, жизнь вынесет. Самому после слюбится. Вам теперь только воздуху надо, воздуху, воздуху!","- I don't care! You have lost faith, and you think that I am rudely flattering you; how much have you lived yet? How much do you understand? I invented the theory, and I felt ashamed that it broke, which turned out to be very unoriginal! It turned out vile, it's true, but you're still not a hopeless scoundrel. Not such a scoundrel at all! At least, he didn’t fool himself for a long time, he reached the last pillars at once. Whom do I consider you? I consider you to be one of those who even cut out the guts, and he will stand and look at the tormentors with a smile - if only he finds faith or God. Well, and find, and you will live. First of all, you need to change the air for a long time. Well, suffering is also a good thing. suffer. Mikolka, perhaps, is right that he wants suffering. I know that it is not believed, but you do not philosophize slyly; surrender to life directly, without reasoning; don't worry, it will carry you right to the shore and put you on your feet. Which coast? How do I know? I only believe that you still have a lot to live. I know that you now accept my words as a race memorized; yes, maybe later remember, it will come in handy someday; that's why I'm talking. It's also good that you just killed the old woman. And if you came up with another theory, then, perhaps, you would have done a hundred million times more ugly thing! Also God, maybe we should thank; how do you know: maybe God is protecting you for what. And you have a great heart and be less afraid. Have you been scared of the great upcoming performance? No, it's a shame to be a coward. If you have taken such a step, so be strong. There's justice here. Do what justice demands. I know that you do not believe, but, by God, life will endure. Fall in love with yourself afterwards. All you need now is air, air, air!","“You don’t give a damn! You’ve lost your faith and you think I’m flattering you crudely; but have you really lived much yet? Do you understand all that much? You conceived a theory and felt ashamed that it failed, that it proved to be not very original! It turned out poorly, that’s true, but you’re still not a hopeless scoundrel. You’re not such a scoundrel at all! At least you didn’t deceive yourself for long; you headed straight for the final posts. Do you know how I regard you? I consider you one of those people who, if their innards were being cut out, they’d stand there smiling at their tormentor—if only they’ve found faith or God. Well, find it and you’ll go on living. In the first place, you’ve needed a change of air for some time. So, suffering’s also a good thing. Go on, suffer. That Mikolka may even be right to want to suffer. I know you don’t believe it—but don’t philosophize too cleverly; give yourself up to life directly, without deliberating; don’t worry— it’ll carry you over to the other shore and stand you on your feet. Onto what shore? And how do I know? I merely believe that you still have a long life ahead of you. I know that now you hear my words as a long, boring prepared exhortation; but you may recall it afterward, it may be of use to you at some time; that’s why I’m speaking. It’s a good thing that you killed only an old woman. If you’d conceived of another theory, you might even have done something a hundred million times worse! Perhaps you should thank God; how do you know? Perhaps He’s saving you for something. Have a great heart and be less afraid. Are you afraid of some great impending responsibility? No, that would be shameful. If you’ve taken such a step, then have courage. That’s justice. You must fulfill what justice demands. I know that you don’t believe it but, so help me God, life will carry you over. Afterward you’ll even come to like it. For now you need only air, air, air!”","‘Who cares, indeed! You’ve lost your beliefs and think I’m telling you barefaced lies—but have you had much of a life so far? Do you understand a lot? You thought up a theory, and now you’re ashamed that it didn’t work out—and it all ended up looking very unoriginal! Yes, it did turn out disgracefully, that’s the truth, but even so you’re not a hopeless villain. Not at all that sort of villain! At least you didn’t go deceiving yourself for long—you went straight to the very limit. What do you think I take you for? I take you for the sort of person who—even if he’s being disembowelled alive—will stand there smiling at his torturers—so long as he finds a faith or a God. So—find yourself one, and you’ll live. First off, you’ve needed a change of air for some time. And suffering is no bad thing either. Go and suffer a bit. Perhaps that Mikolka is right to seek for suffering. I know you don’t believe me—but don’t try to be too clever; give yourself up to life, straight off, don’t think about it; and don’t worry, it’ll cast you up on the shore and set you on your feet. Which shore? How can I know? All I believe is that you still have a lot of living to do. I know you think that what I’m telling you is nothing but a sermon I’ve learnt by heart; but perhaps you’ll remember it one day, and it’ll stand you in good stead. That’s why I’m talking to you. And another good thing is that you only killed an old woman. If you’d thought up a different theory, you might have done something a hundred million times more wicked! Perhaps you ought to be giving thanks to God; for all you know, he may be saving you just for that! Be of good heart, and don’t be so fearful. Are you frightened by the great ordeal ahead of you? No, it’s shameful to be frightened of it now. Once you’ve taken a step like that, you have to stand firm. That’s only fair. Now you must do what fairness demands. I know you don’t believe me; but I swear to God, life will carry you through. And you’ll be glad of it later on. All you need now is air, air, air!’","“Damn it, if you like! You’ve lost faith and you think that I am grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? How much do you understand? You made up a theory and then you were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be not at all original! It turned out to be something base, that’s true, but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base! At least you didn’t deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the furthest point in one leap. How do I see you? I see you as one of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts their entrails out, if only they have found faith or God. Find it and you will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too, is a good thing. Suffer! Maybe Nikolai is right in wanting to suffer. I know you don’t believe in it—but don’t be over-wise; fling yourself straight into life, without deliberation; don’t be afraid—the flood will bring you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again. What bank? How can I tell? I only believe that you have a long life before you. I know that you think all my words now are a set speech prepared beforehand, but maybe you will remember them afterwards. They may be of use some time. That’s why I speak. It’s as well that you only killed the old woman. If you’d invented another theory you might perhaps have done something a thousand times more hideous. You ought to thank God, perhaps. How do you know? Perhaps God is saving you for something. But keep your good heart and have less fear! Are you afraid of the great atonement before you? No, it would be shameful to be afraid of it. Since you have taken such a step, you must harden your heart. There is justice in it. You must fulfill the demands of justice. I know that you don’t believe it, but life, in fact, will bring you through. You will live it down in time. What you need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!”"

The door opened slowly and quietly, and all of a sudden a figure appeared—it was yesterday’s man from out of nowhere.","And he was on the point of opening the door, when it suddenly began opening on its own. He started back. The door opened slowly and quietly, and suddenly a figure appeared in the doorway—yesterday’s man ‘from under the ground’.","But as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself. He started and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly, and suddenly a figure appeared—yesterday’s visitor from under the ground."

"Между тем Раскольников, слегка было оборотившийся к нему при ответе, принялся вдруг его снова рассматривать пристально и с каким-то особенным любопытством, как будто давеча еще не успел его рассмотреть всего или как будто что-то новое в нем его поразило: даже приподнялся для этого нарочно с подушки. Действительно, в общем виде Петра Петровича поражало как бы что-то особенное, а именно нечто как бы оправдывавшее название «жениха», так бесцеремонно ему сейчас данное. Во-первых, было видно и даже слишком заметно, что Петр Петрович усиленно поспешил воспользоваться несколькими днями в столице, чтоб успеть принарядиться и прикраситься в ожидании невесты, что, впрочем, было весьма невинно и позволительно. Даже собственное, может быть даже слишком самодовольное, собственное сознание своей приятной перемены к лучшему могло бы быть прощено для такого случая, ибо Петр Петрович состоял на линии жениха. Все платье его было только что от портного, и все было хорошо, кроме разве того только, что все было слишком новое и слишком обличало известную цель. Даже щегольская, новехонькая, круглая шляпа об этой цели свидетельствовала: Петр Петрович как-то уж слишком почтительно с ней обращался и слишком осторожно держал ее в руках. Даже прелестная пара сиреневых, настоящих жувеневских, перчаток свидетельствовала то же самое, хотя бы тем одним, что их не надевали, а только носили в руках для параду. В одежде же Петра Петровича преобладали цвета светлые и юношественные. На нем был хорошенький летний пиджак светло-коричневого оттенка, светлые легкие брюки, таковая же жилетка, только что купленное тонкое белье, батистовый самый легкий галстучек с розовыми полосками, и что всего лучше: все это было даже к лицу Петру Петровичу. Лицо его, весьма свежее и даже красивое, и без того казалось моложе своих сорока пяти лет. Темные бакенбарды приятно осеняли его с обеих сторон, в виде двух котлет, и весьма красиво сгущались возле светло выбритого блиставшего подбородка. Даже волосы, впрочем чуть-чуть лишь с проседью, расчесанные и завитые у парикмахера, не представляли этим обстоятельством ничего смешного или какого-нибудь глупого вида, что обыкновенно всегда бывает при завитых волосах, ибо придает лицу неизбежное сходство с немцем, идущим под венец. Если же и было что-нибудь в этой довольно красивой и солидной физиономии действительно неприятное и отталкивающее, то происходило уж от других причин. Рассмотрев без церемонии г-на Лужина, Раскольников ядовито улыбнулся, снова опустился на подушку и стал по-прежнему глядеть в потолок.","Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who was slightly turning to him when he answered, suddenly began to examine him again intently and with a kind of special curiosity, as if he had not yet had time to consider everything, or as if something new in him had struck him: he even raised himself to this on purpose from the pillow. Indeed, in general, Pyotr Petrovich was struck by something special, as it were, something that seemed to justify the name ""groom"", so unceremoniously given to him now. Firstly, it was evident and even all too noticeable that Pyotr Petrovich was in a hurry to take advantage of several days in the capital in order to have time to dress up and embellish himself in anticipation of the bride, which, however, was very innocent and permissible. Even his own, perhaps even too smug, his own consciousness of his pleasant change for the better could be forgiven for such an occasion, for Pyotr Petrovich was on the line of the groom. All his clothes had just been from a tailor, and everything was fine, except perhaps that everything was too new and too revealing of a known purpose. Even a smart, brand new, round hat testified to this goal: Pyotr Petrovich somehow treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. Even a lovely pair of lilac, real Jouveneux gloves, testified the same, at least one that they were not worn, but only carried in the hands for the parade. In the clothes of Peter Petrovich, light and youthful colors prevailed. He was wearing a pretty summer jacket in a light brown shade, light light trousers, the same vest, the thin linen he had just bought, the lightest cambric tie with pink stripes, and best of all: all this even suited Pyotr Petrovich. His face, very fresh and even handsome, already seemed younger than its forty-five years. Dark sideburns pleasantly overshadowed him on both sides, in the form of two cutlets, and thickened very beautifully near his light-shaven, shining chin. Even the hair, however a little bit gray, combed and curled by the hairdresser, did not represent by this circumstance anything funny or of any stupid appearance, which usually always happens with curled hair, for it gives the face an inevitable resemblance to a German walking down the aisle. If there was anything really unpleasant and repulsive in this rather beautiful and solid physiognomy, it was due to other reasons. Having examined Mr. Luzhin without ceremony, Raskolnikov smiled venomously, sank back on the pillow and began to gaze as before at the ceiling.","Meanwhile, Raskolnikov, who had turned toward him slightly after his response, suddenly took to staring directly at him again with some special curiosity, as if he hadn’t had the chance to examine him fully before, or as if something new about his appearance had struck him. He even raised himself up intentionally from his pillow to do this. As a matter of fact, something in Petr Petrovich’s general appearance did strike him as peculiar, that is, something that seemed to support the term “suitor,” conveyed upon him so unceremoniously just now. In the first place, it was evident, and even too noticeable, that Petr Petrovich had made hasty efforts to use his few days in the capital to get himself all decked out and fancied up in anticipation of meeting his fiancée, which fact, however, was extremely harmless and acceptable. Even his own awareness, perhaps a bit too self-satisfied, his own awareness of this pleasant change for the better could be forgiven on such an occasion, for Petr Petrovich was close to being a bridegroom. All of his apparel had just come from a tailor, and it was all very fine, except perhaps that it was all too new and revealed his purpose too evidently. Even his foppish, trendy round hat bore witness to it : Petr Petrovich treated his hat too respectfully and held it in his hands too cautiously. Even his splendid pair of lilac-colored French gloves bore witness to the same thing, if only because he wasn’t wearing them, merely holding them in his hand for show. Bright and youthful colors predominated in his apparel. He was wearing a fine summer jacket of a light brown hue, bright, lightweight trousers, the same kind of vest, brand-new refined linen, and a light cotton necktie with pink stripes, and best of all, this apparel was even becoming to Petr Petrovich. His face, extremely fresh and even ruddy, seemed younger than his forty-five years, even without his new clothes. Dark muttonchop whiskers shaded his cheeks pleasantly and thickened handsomely next to his closely shaved, shining chin. Even his hair, with only a slight trace of gray, had been combed and curled by a barber, but this fact didn’t make him look comical or foolish, as usually happens with curled hair, because it inevitably conveys to the face the look of a German about to get married. If there was anything really unpleasant and repulsive in his rather handsome and respectable appearance, it was caused by other factors. After unceremoniously examining Mr. Luzhin, Raskolnikov smiled maliciously, once again lowered himself onto his pillow, and began staring at the ceiling as he had done before.","Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned slightly towards Luzhin when he spoke to him, now began once more to stare at him with great curiosity, as if he hadn’t yet had the time to get a good look at him, or as if he were now suddenly struck by something new about him. He even raised himself from the pillow for the purpose. And indeed, there was something especially striking about Piotr Petrovich’s general appearance—something that could have justified the epithet of ‘the bridegroom’ which he had just so unceremoniously applied to him. For one thing it was quite clear, and even rather too obvious, that Piotr Petrovich had made a hasty effort to use his few days in Petersburg to get himself fitted out and smartened up in readiness for his bride; and this, of course, was something quite innocent and allowable. On this occasion, too, one might even have excused his rather over-complacent awareness of how smart he had made himself, seeing that Piotr Petrovich was here as the bridegroom. His whole costume was fresh from the tailor’s, and everything was just right, except that it was all too new, and betrayed too blatantly the purpose he had in mind. Even his dashing new round hat bore witness to it: Piotr Petrovich was treating it with far too much respect, holding it too carefully in his hands. Even his splendid pair of lilac-coloured gloves, genuine Jouvins,* conveyed the same message, if only because he was not wearing them but holding them in his hand to show them off. He wore mostly light and youthful colours: a handsome pale-brown summer jacket, pale lightweight trousers and waistcoat, newly bought fine linen, a cravat of the finest cambric with pink stripes—and the best of it was that all this actually suited him. His face, very fresh and quite handsome, seemed younger than his forty-five years. His cheeks were agreeably shaded by dark mutton-chop whiskers, which grew attractively bushier next to his shiny clean-shaven chin. Even his hair, just faintly receding, had been combed and curled at the barber’s, yet this had not made it seem in the least comic or silly, though this is what generally happens when a man sports curled hair, because it invariably makes him look like a German on his wedding day. If there really was anything unpleasing or unattractive about his reasonably good-looking and stolid appearance, it was due to something else. After his unceremonious inspection of Mr Luzhin, Raskolnikov gave a venomous smile, subsided onto his pillow and went back to staring at the ceiling.","Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he answered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as though he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at him. There certainly was something peculiar in Peter Petrovich’s whole appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of “fiancé” which had so unfortunately been applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far too evident, actually, that Peter Petrovich had eagerly used his few days in the capital to buy himself a new set of clothes in which to greet his fiancée—which was in fact an entirely innocent, permissible thing to do. Even his slightly complacent consciousness of the improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such circumstances, given that Peter Petrovich had just got engaged. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor’s and fine for the occasion, except for the fact that they were too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even the stylish new round hat had the same significance. Peter Petrovich treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale, if only because he did not wear them and just carried them in his hand for show. Light, youthful colors were the dominant feature of Peter Petrovich’s dress. He wore a charming fawn-colored summer jacket, light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same fine new cloth, a cravat made of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it—and the best thing about it was that it all suited Peter Petrovich. His very fresh and even handsome face always looked younger than forty-five, his real age. His dark, lamb-chop whiskers made a beautiful setting on both sides, growing thickly about his shining, clean-shaven chin. Although his hair was touched here and there with gray and had been combed and curled at a hairdresser ’s , it did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day. If there really was something unpleasant and repulsive in his pretty good-looking and imposing face, it was caused by a completely different factor. After he had disrespectfully scanned Mr. Luzhin, Raskolnikov smiled wickedly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as before."
– До приятнейшего свидания…,- Goodbye...,. .”,‘Till our delightful encounter.’,“So shall I.”
"– Быть может, те, которые были невольною причиной, согласятся вознаградить вас, хоть бы в потере доходов…","“Perhaps those who were the unwitting cause will agree to reward you, if only in the loss of income ...","“Perhaps those who were the involuntary cause of his death will agree to compensate you, at least for the loss of income .","‘Those who were the unwitting cause of this may perhaps be willing to compensate you, at least for his lost earnings…’","“Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to compensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings.”"
"«А, сигнал! Вода прибывает, – подумал он, – к утру хлынет, там, где пониже место, на улицы, зальет подвалы и погреба, всплывут подвальные крысы, и среди дождя и ветра люди начнут, ругаясь, мокрые, перетаскивать свой сор в верхние этажи… А который-то теперь час?» И только что подумал он это, где-то близко, тикая и как бы торопясь изо всей мочи, стенные часы пробили три. «Эге, да через час уже будет светать! Чего дожидаться? Выйду сейчас, пойду прямо на Петровский: там где-нибудь выберу большой куст, весь облитый дождем, так что чуть-чуть плечом задеть, и миллионы брызг обдадут всю голову…» Он отошел от окна, запер его, зажег свечу, натянул на себя жилетку, пальто, надел шляпу и вышел со свечой в коридор, чтоб отыскать где-нибудь спавшего в каморке между всяким хламом и свечными огарками оборванца, расплатиться с ним за нумер и выйти из гостиницы. «Самая лучшая минута, нельзя лучше и выбрать!»","""Ah, a signal! Water is coming, he thought, by morning it will rush, where the place is lower, into the streets, it will flood the cellars and cellars, cellar rats will emerge, and in the rain and wind people will begin, swearing, wet, dragging their rubbish to the upper floors ... And What time is it now?"" And just as he thought this, somewhere nearby, ticking and as if hurrying with all his might, the wall clock struck three. “Hey, yes, in an hour it will already be light! What to expect? I’ll go out now, I’ll go straight to Petrovsky: somewhere I’ll choose a large bush, all covered in rain, so that it hurts a little with my shoulder, and millions of splashes will cover my whole head ... ”He moved away from the window, locked it, lit a candle, pulled it over himself waistcoat, coat, put on a hat and went out with a candle into the corridor to find somewhere sleeping in a closet between all sorts of rubbish and candle stubs, pay him for the number and leave the hotel. “The best minute, you can’t choose better!”","“Ah, the signal! The water’s rising,” he thought. “By morning, in the low-lying parts of town, water will pour onto the streets, flooding basements and cellars; the sewer rats will emerge, and amidst the rain and wind, people, soaking wet and cursing, will begin hauling their stuff up to the higher floors. . . . But what time is it now?” And just as he wondered about this, somewhere nearby, the soft sound of a wall clock, seeming to rush ahead, struck the hour of three. “Hey, it’ll start getting light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll head out now, to Petrovsky Park: somewhere in there I’ll choose a large bush, dripping with rain, such that if I touch it at all with my shoulder, millions of drops will splash down on my head . . .” He left the window, locked it, lit the candle, pulled on his jacket and coat, put on his hat, and walked out, carrying his candle, into the corridor to find the ragged fellow, asleep somewhere in a room among all sorts of trash and discarded candle ends, pay him for the room, and leave the hotel. “This is the best time; I couldn’t pick a better one!”","‘Aha! The signal! The water is rising,’ he thought, ‘by morning it’ll have poured along the streets in the low-lying parts of town, flooding the basements and cellars; the cellar rats will swim out, and the people will come out in the rain and wind, all soaked and cursing, to drag their rubbishy stuff upstairs… But what time is it, I wonder?’ As soon as the thought occurred to him, a wall clock somewhere nearby, ticking away in a desperate hurry, struck three. ‘Hey, in another hour dawn will be breaking! What am I waiting for? I’ll get out right away, straight to Petrovsky Park; * and I’ll find a tall shrub somewhere, all wet with the rain, so that if I just brush it with my shoulder, millions of droplets will shower onto my head…’ He stepped back from the window, locked it, lit his candle, pulled on his waistcoat and overcoat, put on his hat and went out into the corridor with his candle to find the ragged waiter, no doubt sleeping in a tiny chamber somewhere surrounded by all sorts of trash and candle ends; he’d pay him for his room and leave the hotel. ‘This is the very best moment, one couldn’t choose a better!’","“Ah, the signal! The river is overflowing,” he thought. “By morning it will be swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper floors. What time is it now?” And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three. “Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll go out at once, straight to the park. I’ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain, so that as soon as one’s shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on one’s head.” He moved away from the window, shut it, lit the candle, put on his waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle, into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the midst of candle ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay him for the room and leave the hotel. “It’s the best moment; I couldn’t choose a better one.”"
"И, наконец, когда уже гость стал подниматься в четвертый этаж, тут только он весь вдруг встрепенулся и успел-таки быстро и ловко проскользнуть назад из сеней в квартиру и притворить за собой дверь. Затем схватил запор и тихо, неслышно, насадил его на петлю. Инстинкт помогал. Кончив все, он притаился не дыша, прямо сейчас у двери. Незваный гость был уже тоже у дверей. Они стояли теперь друг против друга, как давеча он со старухой, когда дверь разделяла их, а он прислушивался.","And, finally, when the guest had already begun to climb to the fourth floor, only then he suddenly started all of a sudden and managed to quickly and deftly slip back from the vestibule into the apartment and close the door behind him. Then he grabbed the lock and quietly, inaudibly, put it on the noose. Instinct helped. Having finished everything, he hid without breathing, right now at the door. The uninvited guest was already at the door too. They were now facing each other, as he had done with the old woman, when the door separated them, and he listened.","At last, when the visitor began climbing up to the fourth floor, only then did Raskolnikov suddenly shudder and manage to slip swiftly and nimbly back from the landing into the apartment and close the door behind himself. Then he grabbed the bolt and quietly, inaudibly slid it into place. Instinct helped him. After he did all this, he stood still without breathing, on the other side of the door. The unwelcome guest was already standing at the door, too. Now they stood on opposite sides, just as he had before with the old woman when the door had separated them, and he listened very carefully.","And eventually, when the visitor had already started mounting up to the fourth floor, Raskolnikov suddenly pulled himself together and just had time to slip swiftly and adroitly back from the landing into the flat, closing the door behind him. Then he grasped the bolt and quietly, inaudibly, slipped it into its socket. Instinct helped him here. When that was done, he came and stood right next to the door, holding his breath. The unwanted visitor had reached the door too. Now they were standing right against one another, just like him and the old woman a short while ago, when there was nothing but the door between them, and he had stood listening.","At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the flat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly, noiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had done this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown visitor was by now also at the door.

"– Так-с, так-с, – не сиделось Порфирию, – мне почти стало ясно теперь, как вы на преступление изволите смотреть-с, но… уж извините меня за мою назойливость (беспокою уж очень вас, самому совестно!) – видите ли-с: успокоили вы меня давеча очень-с насчет ошибочных-то случаев смешения обоих разрядов, но… меня все тут практические разные случаи опять беспокоят!

"«Милый мой Родя,– писала мать, – вот уже два месяца с лишком, как я не беседовала с тобой письменно, отчего сама страдала и даже иную ночь не спала, думая. Но, наверно, ты не обвинишь меня в этом невольном моем молчании. Ты знаешь, как я люблю тебя: ты один у нас, у меня и у Дуни, ты наше все, вся надежда, упование наше. Что было со мною, когда я узнала, что ты уже несколько месяцев оставил университет, за неимением чем содержать себя, и что уроки и прочие средства твои прекратились! Чем могла я с моими ста двадцатью рублями в год пенсиона помочь тебе? Пятнадцать рублей, которые я послала тебе четыре месяца назад, я занимала, как ты и сам знаешь, в счет этого же пенсиона, у здешнего нашего купца Афанасия Ивановича Вахрушина. Он добрый человек и был еще приятелем твоего отца. Но, дав ему право на получение за меня пенсиона, я должна была ждать, пока выплатится долг, а это только что теперь исполнилось, так что я ничего не могла во все это время послать тебе. Но теперь, слава богу, я, кажется, могу тебе еще выслать, да и вообще мы можем теперь даже похвалиться фортуной, о чем и спешу сообщить тебе. И, во-первых, угадываешь ли ты, милый Родя, что сестра твоя вот уже полтора месяца как живет со мною, и мы уже больше не разлучимся и впредь. Слава тебе господи, кончились ее истязания, но расскажу тебе все по порядку, чтобы ты узнал, как все было и что мы от тебя до сих пор скрывали. Когда ты писал мне, тому назад два месяца, что слышал от кого-то, будто Дуня терпит много от грубости в доме господ Свидригайловых, и спрашивал от меня точных объяснений, – что могла я тогда написать тебе в ответ? Если б я написала тебе всю правду, то ты, пожалуй бы, все бросил и хоть пешком, а пришел бы к нам, потому я и характер и чувства твои знаю, и ты бы не дал в обиду сестру свою. Я же сама была в отчаянии, но что было делать? Я и сама-то всей правды тогда не знала. Главное же затруднение состояло в том, что Дунечка, вступив прошлого года в их дом гувернанткой, взяла вперед целых сто рублей под условием ежемесячного вычета из жалованья, и стало быть, и нельзя было место оставить, не расплатившись с долгом. Сумму же эту (теперь могу тебе все объяснить, бесценный Родя) взяла она более для того, чтобы выслать тебе шестьдесят рублей, в которых ты тогда так нуждался и которые ты и получил от нас в прошлом году. Мы тебя тогда обманули, написали, что это из скопленных Дунечкиных прежних денег, но это было не так, а теперь сообщаю тебе всю правду, потому что все теперь переменилось внезапно, по воле божией, к лучшему, и чтобы ты знал, как любит тебя Дуня и какое у нее бесценное сердце. Действительно, господин Свидригайлов сначала обходился с ней очень грубо и делал ей разные неучтивости и насмешки за столом… Но не хочу пускаться во все эти тяжелые подробности, чтобы не волновать тебя напрасно, когда уж все теперь кончено. Короче, несмотря на доброе и благородное обращение Марфы Петровны, супруги г-на Свидригайлова, и всех домашних, Дунечке было очень тяжело, особенно когда г-н Свидригайлов находился, по старой полковой привычке своей, под влиянием Бахуса. Но что же оказалось впоследствии? Представь себе, что этот сумасброд давно уже возымел к Дуне страсть, но все скрывал это под видом грубости и презрения к ней. Может быть, он и сам стыдился и приходил в ужас, видя себя уже в летах и отцом семейства, при таких легкомысленных надеждах, а потому и злился невольно на Дуню. А может быть, и то, что он грубостию своего обращения и насмешками хотел только прикрыть от других всю истину. Но наконец не удержался и осмелился сделать Дуне явное и гнусное предложение, обещая ей разные награды и сверх того бросить все и уехать с нею в другую деревню или, пожалуй, за границу. Можешь представить себе все ее страдания! Оставить сейчас место было нельзя, не только по причине денежного долга, но и щадя Марфу Петровну, которая могла бы вдруг возыметь подозрения, а следовательно, и пришлось бы поселить в семействе раздор. Да и для Дунечки был бы большой скандал; уж так не обошлось бы. Были тут и многие разные причины, так что раньше шести недель Дуня никак не могла рассчитывать вырваться из этого ужасного дома. Конечно, ты знаешь Дуню, знаешь, как она умна и с каким твердым характером. Дунечка многое может сносить и даже в самых крайних случаях найти в себе столько великодушия, чтобы не потерять своей твердости. Она даже мне не написала обо всем, чтобы не расстроить меня, а мы часто пересылались вестями. Развязка же наступила неожиданная. Марфа Петровна нечаянно подслушала своего мужа, умолявшего Дунечку в саду, и, поняв все превратно, во всем ее же и обвинила, думая, что она-то всему и причиной. Произошла у них тут же в саду ужасная сцена: Марфа Петровна даже ударила Дуню, не хотела ничего слушать, а сама целый час кричала и, наконец, приказала тотчас же отвезти Дуню ко мне в город на простой крестьянской телеге, в которую сбросили все ее вещи, белье, платья, все как случилось, неувязанное и неуложенное. А тут поднялся проливной дождь, и Дуня, оскорбленная и опозоренная, должна была проехать с мужиком целых семнадцать верст в некрытой телеге. Подумай теперь, что могла я тебе написать в письме, в ответ на твое, полученное мною два месяца назад, и о чем писать? Сама я была в отчаянии; правду написать тебе не смела, потому что ты очень бы был несчастлив, огорчен и возмущен, да и что мог бы ты сделать? Пожалуй, еще себя погубить, да и Дунечка запрещала; а наполнять письмо пустяками и о чем-нибудь, тогда как в душе такое горе, я не могла. Целый месяц у нас по всему городу ходили сплетни об этой истории, и до того уж дошло, что нам даже в церковь нельзя было ходить с Дуней от презрительных взглядов и шептаний, и даже вслух при нас были разговоры. Все-то знакомые от нас отстранились, все перестали даже кланяться, и я наверно узнала, что купеческие приказчики и некоторые канцеляристы хотели нанести нам низкое оскорбление, вымазав дегтем ворота нашего дома, так что хозяева стали требовать, чтобы мы с квартиры съехали. Всему этому причиной была Марфа Петровна, которая успела обвинить и загрязнить Дуню во всех домах. Она у нас со всеми знакома и в этот месяц поминутно приезжала в город, и так как она немного болтлива и любит рассказывать про свои семейные дела и особенно жаловаться на своего мужа всем и каждому, что очень нехорошо, то и разнесла всю историю в короткое время не только в городе, но и по уезду. Я заболела, Дунечка же была тверже меня, и если бы ты видел, как она все переносила и меня же утешала и ободряла! Она ангел! Но, по милосердию божию, наши муки были сокращены: господин Свидригайлов одумался и раскаялся и, вероятно, пожалев Дуню, представил Марфе Петровне полные и очевидные доказательства всей Дунечкиной невинности, а именно: письмо, которое Дуня еще до тех пор, когда Марфа Петровна застала их в саду, принуждена была написать и передать ему, чтоб отклонить личные объяснения и тайные свидания, на которых он настаивал, и которое, по отъезде Дунечки, осталось в руках г-на Свидригайлова. В этом письме она самым пылким образом и с полным негодованием укоряла его именно за неблагородство поведения его относительно Марфы Петровны, поставляла ему на вид, что он отец и семьянин и что наконец, как гнусно с его стороны мучить и делать несчастною и без того уже несчастную и беззащитную девушку. Одним словом, милый Родя, письмо это так благородно и трогательно написано, что я рыдала, читая его, и до сих пор не могу его читать без слез. Кроме того, в оправдание Дуни явились, наконец, и свидетельства слуг, которые видели и знали гораздо больше, чем предполагал сам г-н Свидригайлов, как это и всегда водится. Марфа Петровна была совершенно поражена и «вновь убита», как сама она нам признавалась, но зато вполне убедилась в невинности Дунечкиной и на другой же день, в воскресенье, приехав прямо в собор, на коленях и со слезами молила владычицу дать ей силу перенесть это новое испытание и исполнить долг свой. Затем, прямо из собора, ни к кому не заезжая, приехала к нам, рассказала нам все, горько плакала и, в полном раскаянии, обнимала и умоляла Дуню простить ее. В то же утро, нисколько не мешкая, прямо от нас, отправилась по всем домам в городе и везде, в самых лестных для Дунечки выражениях, проливая слезы, восстановила ее невинность и благородство ее чувств и поведения. Мало того, всем показывала и читала вслух собственноручное письмо Дунечкино к г-ну Свидригайлову и даже давала снимать с него копии (что, мне кажется, уже и лишнее). Таким образом, ей пришлось несколько дней сряду объезжать всех в городе, так как иные стали обижаться, что другим оказано было предпочтение, и, таким образом, завелись очереди, так что в каждом доме уже ждали заранее и все знали, что в такой-то день Марфа Петровна будет там-то читать это письмо, и на каждое чтение опять-таки собирались даже и те, которые письмо уже несколько раз прослушали и у себя в домах, и у других знакомых, по очереди. Мое мнение, что многое, очень многое, тут было лишнее; но Марфа Петровна уже такого характера. По крайней мере, она вполне восстановила честь Дунечки, и вся гнусность этого дела легла неизгладимым позором на ее мужа, как на главного виновника, так что мне его даже и жаль; слишком уже строго поступили с этим сумасбродом. Дуню тотчас же стали приглашать давать уроки в некоторых домах, но она отказалась. Вообще же все стали к ней вдруг относиться с особенным уважением. Все это способствовало, главным образом, и тому неожиданному случаю, через который теперь меняется, можно сказать, вся судьба наша. Узнай, милый Родя, что к Дуне посватался жених и что она успела уже дать свое согласие, о чем и спешу уведомить тебя поскорее. И хотя дело это сделалось и без твоего совета, но ты, вероятно, не будешь ни на меня, ни на сестру в претензии, так как сам увидишь, из дела же, что ждать и откладывать до получения твоего ответа было бы нам невозможно. Да и сам ты не мог бы заочно обсудить всего в точности. Случилось же так. Он уже надворный советник, Петр Петрович Лужин, и дальний родственник Марфы Петровны, которая многому в этом способствовала. Начал с того, что через нее изъявил желание с нами познакомиться, был как следует принят, пил кофе, а на другой же день прислал письмо, в котором весьма вежливо изъяснил свое предложение и просил скорого и решительного ответа. Человек он деловой и занятый и спешит теперь в Петербург, так что дорожит каждою минутой. Разумеется, мы сначала были очень поражены, так как все это произошло слишком скоро и неожиданно. Соображали и раздумывали мы вместе весь тот день. Человек он благонадежный и обеспеченный, служит в двух местах и уже имеет свой капитал. Правда, ему уже сорок пять лет, но он довольно приятной наружности и еще может нравиться женщинам, да и вообще человек он весьма солидный и приличный, немного только угрюмый и как бы высокомерный. Но это, может быть, только так кажется, с первого взгляда. Да и предупреждаю тебя, милый Родя, как увидишься с ним в Петербурге, что произойдет в очень скором времени, то не суди слишком быстро и пылко, как это и свойственно тебе, если на первый взгляд тебе что-нибудь в нем не покажется. Говорю это на случай, хотя и уверена, что он произведет на тебя впечатление приятное. Да и, кроме того, чтоб обознать какого бы то ни было человека, нужно относиться к нему постепенно и осторожно, чтобы не впасть в ошибку и предубеждение, которые весьма трудно после исправить и загладить. А Петр Петрович, по крайней мере по многим признакам, человек весьма почтенный. В первый же свой визит он объявил нам, что он человек положительный, но во многом разделяет, как он сам выразился, «убеждения новейших поколений наших» и враг всех предрассудков. Многое и еще он говорил, потому что несколько как бы тщеславен и очень любит, чтоб его слушали, но ведь это почти не порок. Я, разумеется, мало поняла, но Дуня объяснила мне, что он человек хотя и небольшого образования, но умный и, кажется, добрый. Ты знаешь характер сестры твоей, Родя. Это девушка твердая, благоразумная, терпеливая и великодушная, хотя и с пылким сердцем, что я хорошо в ней изучила. Конечно, ни с ее, ни с его стороны особенной любви тут нет, но Дуня, кроме того что девушка умная, – в то же время и существо благородное, как ангел, и за долг поставит себе составить счастье мужа, который, в свою очередь, стал бы заботиться о ее счастии, а в последнем мы не имеем покамест больших причин сомневаться, хотя и скоренько, признаться, сделалось дело. К тому же он человек очень расчетливый и, конечно, сам увидит, что его собственное супружеское счастье будет тем вернее, чем Дунечка будет за ним счастливее. А что там какие-нибудь неровности в характере, какие-нибудь старые привычки и даже некоторое несогласие в мыслях (чего и в самых счастливых супружествах обойти нельзя), то на этот счет Дунечка сама мне сказала, что она на себя надеется, что беспокоиться тут нечего и что она многое может перенести, под условием если дальнейшие отношения будут честные и справедливые. Он, например, и мне показался сначала как бы резким; но ведь это может происходить именно оттого, что он прямодушный человек, и непременно так. Например, при втором визите, уже получив согласие, в разговоре он выразился, что уж и прежде, не зная Дуни, положил взять девушку честную, но без приданого, и непременно такую, которая уже испытала бедственное положение; потому, как объяснил он, что муж ничем не должен быть обязан своей жене, а гораздо лучше, если жена считает мужа за своего благодетеля. Прибавлю, что он выразился несколько мягче и ласковее, чем я написала, потому что я забыла настоящее выражение, а помню одну только мысль, и, кроме того, сказал он это отнюдь не преднамеренно, а, очевидно, проговорившись, в пылу разговора, так что даже старался потом поправиться и смягчить; но мне все-таки показалось это немного как бы резко, и я сообщила потом Дуне. Но Дуня даже с досадой отвечала мне, что «слова еще не дело», и это, конечно, справедливо. Пред тем как решиться, Дунечка не спала всю ночь и, полагая, что я уже сплю, встала с постели и всю ночь ходила взад и вперед по комнате; наконец стала на колени и долго и горячо молилась перед образом, а наутро объявила мне, что она решилась.","“My dear Rodya,” my mother wrote, “for more than two months now, I haven’t talked with you in writing, which is why I myself suffered and didn’t even sleep on another night thinking. But, probably, you will not accuse me of this involuntary silence of mine. You know how I love you: you are the only one with us, with me and with Dunya, you are our everything, all our hope, our hope. What happened to me when I found out that you had already left the university for several months, for lack of anything to support yourself, and that your lessons and other means of yours had stopped! How could I help you with my one hundred and twenty rubles a year of retirement? The fifteen rubles that I sent you four months ago, I borrowed, as you yourself know, on account of the same pension, from our local merchant Afanasy Ivanovich Vakhrushin. He is a kind man and was also your father's friend. But, having given him the right to receive my pension, I had to wait for the debt to be paid off, and this has just come true, so I could not send you anything all this time. But now, thank God, I think I can send you more, and in general we can now even boast of fortune, which I hasten to inform you about. And, first of all, do you guess, dear Rodya, that your sister has been living with me for a month and a half, and we will not be parted any more in the future. Thank you God, her torture is over, but I will tell you everything in order, so that you find out how everything was and what we have hid from you until now. When you wrote to me, two months ago, that you heard from someone that Dunya suffered a lot from rudeness in the house of the Svidrigailovs, and asked me for precise explanations - what could I write back to you then? If I wrote you the whole truth, then you probably would have abandoned everything and even on foot, but would have come to us, because I know your character and feelings, and you would not give your sister an offense. I myself was in despair, but what could I do? I myself did not know the whole truth then. The main difficulty was that Dunechka, having entered their house as a governess last year, took in advance a whole hundred rubles under the condition of a monthly deduction from her salary, and therefore it was impossible to leave a place without paying off the debt. This sum (now I can explain everything to you, priceless Rodya) she took more in order to send you sixty rubles, which you so needed then and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then, wrote that it was from the accumulated Dunechka's old money, but it was not so, and now I tell you the whole truth, because everything has now changed suddenly, by the will of God, for the better, and so that you know how much he loves you Dunya and what a priceless heart she has. Indeed, Mr. Svidrigailov at first treated her very rudely and made all kinds of impoliteness and ridicule at the table ... But I don’t want to go into all these difficult details, so as not to worry you in vain when it’s all over now. In short, despite the kind and noble treatment of Marfa Petrovna, the wife of Mr. Svidrigailov, and all the household, Dunechka was very hard, especially when Mr. Svidrigailov was, according to his old regimental habit, under the influence of Bacchus. But what happened afterwards? Imagine that this madman had long had a passion for Duna, but he hid it all under the guise of rudeness and contempt for her. Maybe he himself was ashamed and horrified, seeing himself already in his years and the father of a family, with such frivolous hopes, and therefore involuntarily angry at Dunya. Or maybe the fact that with the rudeness of his address and ridicule he only wanted to hide the whole truth from others. But at last he could not resist and dared to make Duna an explicit and vile offer, promising her various rewards and, moreover, to drop everything and go with her to another village or, perhaps, abroad. You can imagine all her suffering! It was impossible to leave the place now, not only because of the monetary debt, but also sparing Marfa Petrovna, who could suddenly have suspicions, and therefore, would have to settle discord in the family. And for Dunechka it would have been a big scandal; it wouldn't have been that way. There were also many different reasons, so that before six weeks Dunya could not expect to get out of this terrible house. Of course, you know Dunya, you know how smart she is and with what a firm character. Dunechka can endure a lot and even in the most extreme cases find so much generosity in herself so as not to lose her firmness. She didn't even write to me about everything, so as not to upset me, and we often sent messages. The denouement came unexpected. Marfa Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband begging Dunechka in the garden, and, realizing everything wrong, blamed her for everything, thinking that she was the cause of everything. They had a terrible scene right there in the garden: Marfa Petrovna even hit Dunya, did not want to listen to anything, but she herself shouted for an hour and, finally, ordered to immediately take Dunya to my town on a simple peasant cart, into which all her belongings were thrown , linen, dresses, everything is as it happened, untied and untied. And then a pouring rain arose, and Dunya, offended and disgraced, had to travel with the peasant as much as seventeen miles in an uncovered cart. Think now, what could I write to you in a letter, in response to yours, which I received two months ago, and what to write about? I myself was desperate; I did not dare to write you the truth, because you would have been very unhappy, upset and indignant, and what could you do? Perhaps, even to ruin myself, and Dunechka forbade; and I could not fill the letter with trifles and about something, while there was such grief in my heart, I could not. For a whole month we had gossip about this story all over the city, and it got to the point that we couldn't even go to church with Dunya because of contemptuous looks and whispering, and even there were conversations aloud in front of us. All our acquaintances moved away from us, everyone stopped even bowing, and I probably learned that the merchant clerks and some clerks wanted to inflict a low insult on us by smearing the gates of our house with tar, so the owners began to demand that we move out of the apartment. The reason for all this was Marfa Petrovna, who managed to blame and pollute Dunya in all houses. She is familiar with all of us and this month she came to the city every minute, and since she is a little chatty and loves to talk about her family affairs and especially complain about her husband to everyone and everyone, which is very bad, she smashed the whole story in a short time not only in the city, but also in the countryside. I fell ill, but Dounia was harder than me, and if you could only see how she endured everything and consoled and encouraged me! She is an angel! But, by the mercy of God, our torment was reduced: Mr. Svidrigailov changed his mind and repented and, probably having pity on Dunya, presented Marfa Petrovna with complete and obvious evidence of Dunechka's innocence, namely: a letter that Dunya had before Marfa Petrovna found them in the garden, I was forced to write and hand them over to him in order to reject the personal explanations and secret meetings on which he insisted, and which, after Dunechka's departure, remained in the hands of Mr. Svidrigailov. In this letter, she reproached him in the most ardent manner and with complete indignation precisely for the ignorance of his behavior in relation to Marfa Petrovna, pretended to him that he was a father and a family man and that, finally, how disgusting of him was to torment and make unhappy an already unhappy and a defenseless girl. In a word, dear Rodya, this letter is so nobly and touchingly written that I sobbed while reading it, and to this day I cannot read it without tears. In addition, in justification of Dunya, the testimonies of the servants finally appeared, who saw and knew much more than Mr. Svidrigailov himself assumed, as is always the case. Marfa Petrovna was completely amazed and ""killed again"", as she herself confessed to us, but on the other hand, she was completely convinced of Dunechkina's innocence, and on the very next day, Sunday, arriving directly at the cathedral, on her knees and with tears she begged the mistress to give her the strength to endure it new test and fulfill your duty. Then, right from the cathedral, without visiting anyone, she came to us, told us everything, cried bitterly and, in complete repentance, hugged and begged Dunya to forgive her. That morning, without hesitation, straight from us, she went to all the houses in the city and everywhere, in the expressions most flattering for Dounia, shedding tears, restored her innocence and the nobility of her feelings and behavior. Moreover, she showed everyone and read aloud Dunechkino's own handwritten letter to Mr. Svidrigailov and even gave them copies of it (which, it seems to me, is already superfluous). Thus, for several days in a row, she had to go around everyone in the city, as some began to take offense that others were given preference, and thus queues started up, so that in every house they were already waiting in advance and everyone knew that at such and such day Marfa Petrovna will be there to read this letter, and for each reading, even those who have already listened to the letter several times, both in their homes and with other acquaintances, also gathered for each reading. My opinion is that much, very much, was superfluous here; but Marfa Petrovna is already of this character. At least she completely restored Dounia's honor, and all the vileness of this case fell into an indelible shame on her husband, as the main culprit, so I even feel sorry for him; too harshly dealt with this madcap. Dunya was immediately invited to give lessons in some houses, but she refused. In general, everyone suddenly began to treat her with special respect. All this contributed mainly to that unexpected event, through which now, one might say, our whole fate is changing. Find out, dear Rodya, that the fiancé has wooed Duna and that she has already given her consent, and I hasten to notify you as soon as possible. And although this deed was done without your advice, you probably will not be against me or your sister in a claim, since you will see for yourself, from the case that it would be impossible for us to wait and postpone until we receive your answer. And you yourself could not discuss everything exactly in absentia. It happened so. He is already a court councilor, Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, and a distant relative of Marfa Petrovna, who contributed a lot in this. He began by expressing a desire to get to know us through her, was properly received, drank coffee, and the next day he sent a letter in which he very politely explained his proposal and asked for a quick and decisive answer. He is a businesslike and busy man and is now in a hurry to Petersburg, so he values every minute. Of course, at first we were very amazed, since it all happened too soon and unexpectedly. We have been thinking and thinking together all that day. He is a trustworthy and wealthy person, serves in two places and already has his own capital. True, he is already forty-five years old, but he is quite pleasant in appearance and can still be liked by women, and in general he is a very solid and decent man, only a little gloomy and, as it were, arrogant. But this, perhaps, is the only way it seems, at first glance. Yes, and I warn you, dear Rodya, when you see him in Petersburg, which will happen very soon, then do not judge too quickly and ardently, as is typical of you, if at first glance you don’t seem to have something in him. I say this on occasion, although I am sure that he will make a pleasant impression on you. And, besides, in order to identify any person, you need to treat him gradually and carefully so as not to fall into error and prejudice, which are very difficult to correct and make amends afterwards. And Pyotr Petrovich, at least in many ways, is a very respectable man. On his very first visit, he announced to us that he is a positive person, but in many respects shares, as he himself put it, “the convictions of our newest generations” and an enemy of all prejudices. He said a lot and more, because he was somewhat vain and very fond of being listened to, but this is almost not a vice. I, of course, did not understand much, but Dunya explained to me that although he was a man of little education, he was smart and, it seemed, kind. You know your sister's character, Rodya. This girl is firm, prudent, patient and generous, albeit with a fervent heart, which I learned well in her. Of course, there is no special love on either her or his side, but Dunya, besides being a smart girl, is at the same time a noble being, like an angel, and in return will set herself to make up the happiness of her husband, who, in turn , I would have begun to care about her happiness, and in the latter we have no great reason to doubt, although, I must confess, it has become a matter of course. In addition, he is a very calculating person and, of course, he will see for himself that his own marital happiness will be the more true the happier Dunechka is after him. And that there are some irregularities in character, some old habits and even some disagreement in thoughts (which even in the happiest marriages cannot be avoided), then on this score Dunechka herself told me that she hoped for herself that she would be worried here. there is nothing and that she can endure a lot, under the condition that further relations are honest and fair. For example, he seemed to me at first, as it were, harsh; but this can happen precisely because he is a straightforward person, and certainly so. For example, on the second visit, having already received consent, in the conversation he expressed that even before, not knowing Dunya, he had decided to take an honest girl, but without a dowry, and certainly one who had already experienced a plight; because, as he explained, a husband should not owe anything to his wife, but it is much better if the wife considers her husband to be her benefactor. I will add that he expressed himself somewhat softer and more affectionate than I wrote, because I have forgotten the real expression, and I remember only one thought, and, moreover, he said this by no means deliberately, but, obviously, having let it slip, in the heat of conversation, so that he even tried to recover and soften afterwards; but it still seemed to me a little bit harsh, and I later informed Duna. But Dunya, even with annoyance, answered me that “words are not the matter yet,” and this, of course, is true. Before making up her mind, Dounia did not sleep all night and, believing that I was already asleep, got out of bed and walked up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down and prayed long and fervently in front of the icon, and in the morning she announced to me that she had made up her mind.","“My dear Rodya,” his mother wrote. “It’s been more than two months since I’ve written you a letter, as a result of which I’ve suffered, at times even lost sleep, wondering about you. But most likely you won’t blame me for my unintended silence. You know how I love you; you’re all we have, Dunya and I, you mean everything to us, all our hope, all our aspiration. I was so upset when I learned that you’d left the university several months ago because you were unable to support yourself, and that your lessons and other sources had ended! How could I help you with my pension of only one hundred and twenty rubles a year? As you well know, I’d borrowed those fifteen rubles I sent you four months ago from our local merchant Afanasy Ivanovich Vakhrushin, on the promise of my pension. He’s a good man and was your father’s acquaintance. But in giving him the right to receive my pension for me, I was obliged to wait until I repaid my debt, and that’s only just happened, so all this time I haven’t been able to send you anything. But now, thank God, it seems I can send you some more; in general, we can even boast of good fortune now about which I hasten to inform you. In the first place, could you guess, dear Rodya, that your dear sister has been living with me for the last month and a half, and we’ll no longer be separated in the future. Praise the Lord, her torments have ended, but I’ll tell you everything in order, so you’ll know what’s happened and what we’ve been keeping from you up to now. When you wrote to me about two months ago that you’d heard from someone or other that Dunya had to endure much rudeness in Mr. Svidrigaylov’s house and you asked me for a more detailed explanation —what could I write to you at that time? If I’d told you the whole truth, you’d probably have dropped everything and rushed to see us, even come on foot, because I know your character and your feelings, and you wouldn’t have allowed your sister to be insulted. I myself was in despair, but what could I do? Even I didn’t know the whole truth then. The main difficulty was that Dunya, who’d entered their household last year as a governess, had received an advance of one hundred rubles, on the condition that a certain amount would be deducted from her salary each month; therefore, she couldn’t leave her position until she’d repaid her debt. This amount (I can now explain it all to you, precious Rodya) she’d accepted mostly so she could send you sixty rubles, which you needed then and which you received from us last year. At the time we deceived you, writing that it had come from Dunya’s savings, but that wasn’t so. Now I’m telling you the whole truth because everything’s suddenly changed, by the will of God, for the better, and so you’ll know how much Dunya loves you and what a precious heart she has. As a matter of fact, right from the start Mr. Svidrigaylov treated her very rudely and made various impolite remarks and insults to her at the table. . . . But I don’t want to dwell on these agonizing difficulties and upset you for no reason, since all of that’s stopped. In brief, in spite of the kind and generous treatment by Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaylov’s wife, and all the servants, Dunechka had a very difficult time, especially when Mr. Svidrigaylov, following old regimental custom, was under the influence of Bacchus. But what happened afterward? Just imagine that this madman had conceived a passion for Dunya sometime earlier, but had been concealing it under the guise of rudeness and contempt for her. Perhaps he himself was ashamed and horrified to see that he himself, at his age and as the father of a family, harbored such frivolous hopes; therefore, he inadvertently took his anger out on Dunya. Perhaps by his rude treatment and mockery he wanted to hide the whole truth from other people. But, in the end, he couldn’t restrain himself and dared make an open and vile proposition to Dunya, promising her various rewards; moreover, he said he would forsake everything and go to another village with her or, perhaps, even abroad. You can imagine her suffering! It was impossible for her to leave her position at that time, not only because of her financial obligation, but because she wanted to spare Marfa Petrovna, who might suddenly conceive a hatred for her, and consequently arouse discord in the household. It would create a huge scandal for Dunechka; she’d never be able to escape it. There were many other reasons why Dunya couldn’t consider removing herself from this horrible house earlier than six weeks. Of course, you know Dunya , you know how clever she is and what a strong character she has. She can tolerate many things and find so much generosity within herself even in the most extreme circumstances, so as not to lose her strength. She didn’t even write to me about all this so as not to upset me, though we often exchanged news. The finale was unexpected. Marfa Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dunechka in the garden. Misinterpreting the whole affair, she blamed Dunya for everything, thinking that she was the cause of it all. It occasioned a terrible scene right there in the garden: Marfa Petrovna even struck her, and didn’t want to listen to reason. She shouted for a whole hour and finally ordered that Dunya be sent back to me in town on a simple peasant’s cart, onto which they tossed all her things, linens, dresses, in any which way, untied and unpacked. Then it began to pour down rain; Dunya, insulted and disgraced, had to make the trip, all eleven miles, with a peasant in an open cart. Now just imagine, how and what could I write in reply to your letter that I’d received two months ago? I myself was in despair. I dared not tell you the truth because you’d be so unhappy, bitter, and angry. And what could you do? You might have gotten yourself into trouble; besides, Dunya wouldn’t allow it. I couldn’t just fill my letter with nonsense about this and that, when I felt such sorrow in my soul. Rumors about this episode circulated through the whole town for an entire month, and it reached the point where Dunya and I couldn’t even go to church because of all the contemptuous looks and whispers. Remarks were even uttered aloud in our presence. All of our acquaintances shunned us, and everyone stopped greeting us. I learned for certain that some merchants’ shop assistants and some office clerks wanted to insult us in the worst possible way by tarring the gates of our house so that the landlord would demand that we vacate our apartment. The cause of all this was Marfa Petrovna, who’d managed to denounce and slander Dunya in every household. She was acquainted with everyone in town, and during that month she visited town continually. She’s somewhat talkative and loves to go on about family matters, especially complaining about her husband to each and every person, which is not a good thing; so she spread the whole story in a very short time, not only in town, but throughout the district. I fell ill, but Dunya was stronger than I was; if you’d only seen how she endured it all and how she consoled and reassured me! She’s an angel! But, by God’s grace, our torments ended. Mr. Svidrigaylov thought better of it, repented, probably taking pity on Dunya, and presented to Marfa Petrovna clear and complete evidence of Dunya’s innocence, namely this: a letter that Dunya had felt compelled to write and convey to him, even before Marfa Petrovna came upon them in the garden, one that remained in his possession after Dunya’s departure. The note asked him to cease these personal declarations and secret meetings that he’d insisted on. In this letter she reproached him in the most impassioned way and with total indignation for his dishonorable treatment of Marfa Petrovna. She reminded him that he was a father and the head of a household, and, finally, she said how vile it was for him to torment and distress a young woman who was already in distress and defenseless. In a word, dear Rodya, this letter was so nobly and poignantly written that I sobbed while reading it and to this day can’t do so without shedding tears. Contributing to Dunya’s exoneration came the testimony of those servants who saw and knew much more than Mr. Svidrigaylov supposed, as always happens. Marfa Petrovna was completely astounded and ‘once again crushed,’ as she herself acknowledged; on the other hand, she was fully convinced of Dunechka’s innocence. The very next day, Sunday, heading directly to church, she tearfully implored Our Lady to give her the strength to bear this new ordeal and carry out her duty. Then, right after church, without making any stops, she came to us and told us everything. She wept bitterly and, with full repentance, embraced Dunya and begged her forgiveness. That same morning, without tarrying, she set off right from our house to all the households in town, and in each one, shedding tears, she restored Dunya’s innocence and the nobility of her feelings and behavior in the most flattering terms. She showed everyone Dunechka’s handwritten letter to Mr. Svidrigaylov, read it aloud, and even allowed people to make copies of it (which, it seems to me, was going too far). In this way it took her several days to visit everyone in town, so that some people felt offended that she was partial to others. Lines were formed since she was expected in advance at every household and everyone knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would read the letter there. At each reading, people would line up who’d already heard the letter read several times in their own homes and in those of their other acquaintances. In my opinion, much of this, very much, was unnecessary; but such was Marfa Petrovna’s character. At least she fully restored Dunechka’s honor. All the vileness of this affair left an indelible disgrace on her husband as the main culprit, so that I even began to feel sorry for him. People dealt too severely with that madman. Soon Dunya was invited to give lessons in several households, but she refused. In general, people suddenly began treating her with special respect. All of this served principally to further the unexpected circumstance by which, one can say, our entire fate is now being altered. You should know, dear Rodya, that a suitor has proposed to Dunya and she’s already given her consent, which I’m writing to inform you about immediately. Even though this matter was conducted without your advice, you probably won’t bear any grudge either against me or your sister, since you yourself will see, from the facts, that it was impossible to delay or wait for your answer to arrive. Besides, you yourself couldn’t have judged it accurately without being here. This is how it happened. He’s already a court councillor, this Petr Petrovich Luzhin, a distant relative of Marfa Petrovna’s, who herself helped a great deal in this affair. It all began with his expressing a desire through her that he wished to make our acquaintance; he was received properly, had some coffee, and the next day sent a letter in which he very politely stated his proposal and asked for a swift and definitive answer. He’s a practical, busy man, just about to leave for Petersburg, so he values every minute. Of course, at first we were very surprised, since all this took place so swiftly and unexpectedly. All that day we pondered and considered it together. He’s a reliable, well-to-do person, works in two places, and has already amassed some capital. It’s true that he’s forty-five, but he has a rather pleasant appearance and can still be attractive to women; he’s also an extremely solid and decent man, only a little gloomy and a bit arrogant. But perhaps it only seems that way, at first glance. I advise you, dear Rodya, when you meet him in Petersburg, which will happen quite soon, not to judge him too quickly and heatedly, as you sometimes do, if at first glance you think something about him is not quite right. I say this just in case, although I’m sure that he’ll make a pleasant impression on you. Besides, in order to determine what sort of person he is, one must deal with him gradually and carefully, so as not to fall into error or prejudice, which is difficult to correct or smooth over afterward. And Petr Petrovich, at least from many indications, is an extremely respectable man. On his first visit, he stated that he was a positive person; he shares to a large extent, as he himself explained it, ‘the convictions of our younger generation,’ and he is an enemy of all prejudices. He said a great many other things because he seems a bit vain and very much likes to be listened to, but that’s almost not a fault. Of course, I understood very little, but Dunya explained to me that although he is not a well-educated man, he is clever and, it seems, kind. You know your sister’s character, Rodya. She’s a strong young woman, sensible, patient, and generous, although she has an impassioned heart, as I’ve come to know well. Of course, there’s no particular love involved, either on her side or on his, but Dunya, in addition to being a clever young woman, is also a lofty creature—an angel. She’ll consider it her duty to make her husband happy, and he, in turn, will concern himself with his wife’s happiness, which, for the time being, we have no major reason to doubt, even though, I must admit, this whole affair was concluded rather quickly. Besides, he’s a very prudent man and of course will realize that his own conjugal happiness will be more assured the happier Dunechka is with him. As for the fact that there are some irregularities in his character, some old habits, even some disagreement in their views (which can’t be avoided even in the happiest of marriages), on that count Dunechka told me that she’s relying on herself and there’s no reason to be concerned, that she can tolerate a great deal on the condition that their future relations will be fair and honest. For example, he seemed a bit harsh to me at first; but that could be precisely because he’s such a straightforward man, and it’s absolutely so. For example, during his second visit, after he’d already received her consent, he expressed in our conversation that previously, even before he knew Dunya, he’d intended to marry an honest young woman, but one without a dowry, and certainly one who’d already experienced poverty; because, as he explained, a husband should in no way be obligated to his wife, and that it’s much better if the wife considers her husband to be her benefactor. I’ll add that he expressed himself a little more gently and affectionately than I described, but I’ve forgotten his exact words, and recall only the idea; besides, he said it without any premeditation. Obviously it just slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that afterward he even tried to correct himself and soften it. But it still seemed somewhat harsh to me, and I conveyed this to Dunya later. But she replied, even somewhat annoyed, that ‘words are not the same as deeds,’ and of course that’s fair. Before deciding, Dunechka didn’t sleep the whole night; supposing that I was already asleep, she got out of bed and spent the whole night pacing back and forth in the room. Finally she knelt down and prayed fervently in front of the icon for a long time; in the morning, she announced to me that she’d made a decision.","‘My dear Rodia,’ wrote his mother, ‘It’s over two months now since I last had a chat with you by letter. It’s been hard on me too, and I’ve spent a few sleepless nights thinking about it. But I dare say you won’t blame me for my silence, which I couldn’t help. You know how much I love you—you’re all we have, Dunia and I, you’re our whole world— all our hope and trust is in you. What didn’t I suffer when I found out that you’d left the university months before, because you had nothing to live on, and that your lessons and other earnings had stopped! What could I do to help you, on my pension of a hundred and twenty roubles a year? As you know, the fifteen roubles I sent you four months ago were borrowed from our local merchant Afanasi Ivanovich Vakhrushin, on the security of that same pension. He’s a kind man who used to be your father’s friend. But once I’d given him the right to draw my pension instead of me, I had to wait till the debt was repaid, and that’s only just happened now, so I haven’t been able to send you anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I can send you some more; and actually we can be quite pleased with our good fortune at the moment, which I can’t wait to tell you about. And first of all, would you believe, dearest Rodia, that your sister has already been living with me for a month and a half, and we’re never going to be apart again. Praise the Lord, her torments are over, but I’ll tell you everything in order, so that you know how everything has been and everything that we have been keeping from you until now. When you wrote to me two months ago that you had heard from someone that Dunia was having to put up with a lot of rudeness at the Svidrigailovs’ house, and asked me to tell you exactly what was going on—what could I have answered you at the time? If I’d told you the whole truth, you’d probably have thrown everything up and come to us, even if you had to walk all the way: for I know what you’re like and how strongly you feel things, and you never would have let your sister be mistreated. I was quite desperate myself—but what could I do? I didn’t know the whole truth then myself. But the main problem was that Dunechka, who had started working for them as a governess last year, had taken an advance of a whole hundred roubles, which was to be deducted in instalments from her monthly wages; so she couldn’t leave her post till she had repaid the debt. She had borrowed that sum (I can tell you all about it now, my most precious Rodia) mainly so as to send you the sixty roubles you needed so badly at the time, and which you had from us last year. We told you that the money had come from Dunechka’s earlier savings, but that wasn’t true, and now I can tell you the whole truth, because by God’s providence everything has suddenly changed for the better, and I want you to know how much Dunia loves you and what a generous heart she has. It’s true that Mr Svidrigailov treated her very rudely at the beginning, talking disrespectfully to her in various ways, and making fun of her at table… But I don’t want to go into all those unpleasant details, upsetting you for nothing, when it’s all over now. So in short, and in spite of the fact that Mr Svidrigailov’s wife Marfa Petrovna and everyone in the house treated her kindly and politely, Dunechka had a very hard time there, especially when Mr Svidrigailov, like the old soldier he is, found himself under the influence of Bacchus. But what happened next? Just imagine—that madman had nursed a passion for Dunia for a long time, but tried to hide the fact by treating her rudely and mocking her. Perhaps he felt ashamed and horrified at himself, a man of his age and father of a family, for cherishing such irresponsible hopes, and maybe that made him feel hostile to Dunia in spite of himself. Or maybe he hoped to hide the truth from everyone else by being rude to her and making fun of her. But in the end he couldn’t control himself and had the effrontery to make Dunia a blatant and revolting proposition, promising her all kinds of bribes and even offering to throw everything up and run away to a different village with her, or more likely take her abroad. You can imagine what she went through! She couldn’t leave her job straight away, not only because of the money she owed but also out of consideration for Marfa Petrovna, who might have come to suspect something, so that Dunia would have set off a family quarrel. And it would have been a great scandal for Dunechka as well—it couldn’t have gone off quietly. And there were a lot of other reasons too, which meant that Dunia could never have hoped to escape from that dreadful household before another six weeks had passed. Of course, you know Dunia, you know how intelligent and strong-minded she is. Dunechka is capable of putting up with a great deal, and even in the very worst situations she finds enough generosity of heart so as not to weaken. She didn’t even write to me about all that, not wanting to upset me, although we were always exchanging news. But it all ended unexpectedly. Marfa Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband pleading with Dunechka in the garden, and misinterpreted it all, accusing her of everything and thinking she was responsible for it. They had a terrible scene, right there in the garden: Marfa Petrovna even hit Dunia, refused to listen to anything, and spent a whole hour yelling at her; finally she gave orders for Dunia to be sent straight back to me in town, on an ordinary farm-cart, with all her belongings flung into it, linen, dresses, everything higgledy-piggledy, nothing packed up or folded. And just then a downpour started, and Dunia, insulted and shamed, had to ride a whole seventeen versts* with that peasant, in his open cart. Now just think—what could I have written to you in a letter, in answer to yours, which I had received two months ago? What could I have written about? I was in despair myself; I didn’t dare tell you the truth, because you would have been so miserable, upset, and indignant—and anyway, what could you have done? You might have come to grief yourself—and besides, Dunechka wouldn’t let me tell you. But filling a letter with trivialities and writing about just anything, when I was suffering such anguish—that was more than I could stand. For a whole month it was the talk of the town, and it got to such a pitch that Dunia and I couldn’t go to church any more because of all the contemptuous looks and whispers—indeed, things were said aloud too, in our presence. All our friends dropped us, they even stopped bowing to us in the street, and I heard for a fact that some shop assistants and clerks were planning to insult us in a horrible way, by smearing our gates with pitch, so that our landlord began demanding that we should leave the flat. It was Marfa Petrovna who was behind all that—she had succeeded in slandering Dunia and blackening her reputation in every household. She knows everyone here, and all that month she kept coming over to town, and since she’s a bit of a chatterbox and loves telling people her family stories, and particularly loves complaining about her husband to all and sundry, which isn’t nice at all, she very quickly spread the whole story not only all round the town but over the whole district. It made me ill, but Dunechka was tougher than me, and if only you had seen how she herself stood up to everything, and comforted me and cheered me up! She’s an angel! But by God’s mercy, our trials came to an end: Mr Svidrigailov came to his senses and repented, and—probably out of pity for Dunia –presented Marfa Petrovna with full and incontrovertible proof of Dunechka’s complete innocence, in the shape of a letter which Dunia had found herself obliged to write and hand to him, even before Marfa Petrovna came upon them in the garden, refusing any further private conversations and secret assignations, which he had been insisting on, and this letter had remained in Mr Svidrigailov’s hands after Dunechka’s departure. In that letter she had reproached him most angrily and indignantly for his improper behaviour towards Marfa Petrovna, reminding him that he was a father and a family man, and finally, how revolting it was of him to torment and cause misery to an already unhappy and defenceless young girl. In a word, my dearest Rodia, her letter was so dignified and so moving that I sobbed when I read it, and even now I can’t read it without bursting into tears. And what is more, the servants eventually gave an account of the event which absolved Dunia from blame—they had seen and understood far more than Mr Svidrigailov imagined—which is invariably what happens. Marfa Petrovna was quite astonished, “crushed all over again” as she confessed to us, but utterly convinced of Dunechka’s innocence, and on the very next day, which was a Sunday, she went straight to the cathedral, got down on her knees and prayed in tears to the Mother of God to give her the strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she came straight from the cathedral to us, not stopping anywhere on the way, and told us everything, and wept bitterly; and repenting with all her heart she embraced Dunechka and implored her to forgive her. And that same morning she went straight from our house to visit all the houses in town to testify again to Dunechka’s innocence and explain, in tears, how noble her sentiments and behaviour had been. And that wasn’t all—she showed everyone Dunechka’s own handwritten letter to Mr Svidrigailov, and read it aloud to them, and even let people take copies of it (which I think was going too far). So she found herself having to spend several days on end visiting everyone in the town, in turn, because some people were offended that others had been given preference over them, so queues built up, and in every house she was expected in advance, and everyone knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading that letter in a particular house, and at every reading people would come along even after they had already heard the letter read several times, in their own homes and then their friends’ homes, one after the other. In my opinion, much of this, a very great deal of this, was going too far; but that’s Marfa Petrovna’s character. At least she completely succeeded in restoring Dunechka’s honour, and all the ignominy of the whole business fell as an indelible disgrace upon her husband, the chief culprit, so that I even feel sorry for him, crazy man, he’s been too severely punished. Straight away Dunia began getting invitations to give lessons in people’s homes, but she turned them down. And generally everyone started to treat her with special respect. All that was particularly helpful in bringing about the unexpected event which has now, as we may say, transformed our whole destiny. Let me tell you, dear Rodia, that Dunia has received a proposal of marriage and has already given her consent, which I want to tell you about at once. And although this has all been settled without your advice, I am sure you won’t hold it against either me or your sister, since you can see for yourself that we couldn’t have waited and put off replying until we heard from you. And in any case you couldn’t have judged things properly without being here. This is how it all happened. He is called Piotr Petrovich Luzhin and is already a Court Councillor, and a distant relative of Marfa Petrovna, who helped in many ways to promote the match. He began by expressing a wish, through her, to make our acquaintance, and was very properly received by us, and had coffee, and on the very next day he sent a letter in which he made a very courteous proposal and requested an early and definite reply. He is an active and busy man, and is now in a hurry to get to Petersburg, so every minute is precious to him. Of course we were very taken aback at first, since everything had happened too suddenly and unexpectedly. We spent that whole day thinking about it and discussing it. He’s a reliable man, well-to-do, he has two positions and has already accumulated some capital. Of course, he is forty-five years old, but he is quite pleasant-looking and could still be attractive to women, and in any case he is a very solid, decent person, only a little bit gloomy and rather haughty. But that may only be a first impression. And let me warn you, my dear Rodia, when you meet him in Petersburg, which you will do very soon, don’t judge him too hastily and impulsively, as you tend to do, if you find anything in him that you don’t like at first sight. I’m saying this just in case, although I’m sure that he will make a good impression on you. And in any case, if you want to get to know someone, you have to take things gradually and cautiously if you’re not to get them wrong and become prejudiced, which would be very difficult to put right and smooth over later on. And Piotr Petrovich is, or at least seems in many ways to be, a most estimable person. At his first visit, he told us he was a man of positive views, but that, as he put it, he shares many of the “convictions of our younger generations”, * and is against all forms of prejudice. And he said a lot of other things too, because he seems to be a little bit vain and very fond of being listened to, but of course that’s not much of a shortcoming. I didn’t understand a lot myself, of course, but Dunia explained that although he may not have all that much education, he’s an intelligent man and seems to be a kind one too. You know your sister’s character, Rodia. She’s a firm, sensible, patient, and generous-hearted girl, though she has an impulsive heart, as I know very well. Of course there’s no particular love either on her side or his, but Dunia, besides being an intelligent girl, is as good as an angel, and she’ll make it her duty to keep her husband happy, and he in his turn will no doubt do the same for her, which so far we have no great reason to doubt, although it must be admitted that the whole business has happened very quickly. And besides, he is a very hard-headed man, and of course he’ll see for himself that the happier he makes Dunechka, the more certain he’ll be of his own happiness in marriage. And as for any quirks of his character, any old habits of his or even certain differences in their views (which you can’t avoid even in the happiest marriages)—on that score, Dunechka herself has said to me that she’ll put her trust in herself, that there’s no need to worry about this, and that she can put up with a great deal so long as their future relationship is fair and honest. Even I, for example, found him rather abrupt at first; but of course that may be because he is a man who knows his own mind, which there is no doubt he does. For instance, at his second visit, when he had already had Dunia’s consent, he mentioned during our conversation that even before meeting Dunia, he had resolved to choose a girl who was honest but had no dowry, and certainly one who had already experienced misfortune; because, he explained, a husband should not be indebted to his wife in any way, and it was much better if she saw him as her benefactor. I must add that he expressed himself rather more gently and kindly than I have just done, because I’ve forgotten the actual words he used, I only remember the sense of them, and what’s more he didn’t mean to say it, it probably just slipped out in the heat of the conversation, and he actually tried to put it right and soften it afterwards, but even so it struck me as rather harsh, as I said to Dunia later. But Dunia answered me quite crossly, saying that “words weren’t deeds”, and of course she’s right. Before making up her mind, Dunechka spent a sleepless night, and thinking that I was asleep she got up from her bed and spent the whole night pacing up and down the room, and eventually knelt in front of the icon and prayed fervently for a long time, and then in the morning she told me she had made up her mind.","”My dear Rodia,” wrote his mother—“it’s over two months since I last had a talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me awake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for my involuntary silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to look to, Dunia and I , you are our all, our one hope, our one mainstay. What a grief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university some months ago, for want of means to support yourself and that you had lost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of my hundred and twenty rubles a year pension? The fifteen rubles I sent you four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension, from Vassily Ivanovich Vakhrushin, our local merchant. He is a kind-hearted man and was a friend of your father’s too. But having given him the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was paid off and that is only just done, so that I’ve been unable to send you anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I will be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate ourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. In the first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodia, that your sister has been living with me for the last six weeks and we will not be separated again in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will tell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything has happened and all that we have until now concealed from you. When you wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dunia had a great deal of rudeness to put up with in the Svidrigailovs’ house, when you wrote that and asked me to tell you all the particulars—what could I write in answer to you? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have dropped everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all the way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not let your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I do? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What made it all so difficult was that Dunia received a hundred rubles in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it was impossible to quit the position without repaying the debt. This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my dearest Rodia) she took chiefly in order to send you sixty rubles, which you needed so badly then and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then, writing that this money came from Dunechka’s savings, but that was not so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dunia loves you and what a priceless heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidrigailov treated her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table . . . But I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite of the kind and generous behavior of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigailov’s wife, and all the rest of the household, Dunechka had a very hard time, especially when Mr. Svidrigailov, relapsing into his old regimental habits, was under the influence of alcohol. And how do you think it was all explained later on? Would you believe that the madman had conceived a passion for Dunia from the beginning, but had concealed it under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dunia. And possibly, too, he simply hoped by his rude and sneering behavior to hide the truth from others. But at last he lost all control and dared to make Dunia an open and vile proposal, promising her all sorts of inducements and offering, besides, to drop everything and take her to another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she suffered! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused; and then Dunia would have been the cause of a discord in the family. And it would have meant a terrible scandal for Dunechka too; that would have been inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dunia could not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know Dunia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she has. Dunechka can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases her generous spirit helps her to retain her firmness. She did not even write to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were constantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dunia in the garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the situation, threw the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna went so far as to strike Dunia, refused to hear anything and was shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dunia should be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which they flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without folding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too, and Dunia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and what could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, chagrined and indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin yourself, and, besides, Dunechka would not allow it; and I could not fill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow. For a whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came to the point that Dunia and I dared not even go to church on account of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the street, and I learnt that some store assistants and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with tar, so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. The cause of all this was Marfa Petrovna, who managed to slander Dunia and throw dirt at her in every family. She knows everyone in the neighborhood, and that month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband— which is not at all right— so in a short time she had spread her story not only in the town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but Dunechka was firmer than I was, and if only you could have seen how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is an angel! But by God’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr. Svidrigailov returned to his senses and repented and, probably feeling sorry for Dunia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and unmistakable proof of Dunechka’s innocence, in the form of a letter Dunia had been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna found them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr. Svidrigailov’s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse personal explanations and secret meetings, on which he was insisting. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation for the baseness of his behavior in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how vile it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenseless girl, unhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodia, the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too, cleared Dunia’s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more than Mr. Svidrigailov had himself supposed—as indeed is always the case with servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and ‘again crushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of Dunechka’s innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dunia and besought her to forgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in the most flattering terms Dunechka’s innocence and the nobility of her feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to every one the letter in Dunechka’s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigailov and even allowed them to take copies of it—which I must say I think was superfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in a row in driving about the whole town, since some people had taken offence that precedence has been given to others, and thus they had to take turns, so that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it, even those who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in other people’s, taking turns. In my opinion a great deal, a very great deal of all this was unnecessary; but that’s Marfa Petrovna’s character. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dunechka’s reputation and the whole vileness of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace upon her husband, as the first person to blame, so that I really began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the madcap too harshly. Dunia was at once asked to give lessons in several families, but she refused. In general everyone suddenly began to treat her with marked respect. All this did much to bring about that unexpected event by which, one may say, all our fate is now transformed. You must know, dear Rodia, that Dunia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry him, of which I hasten to tell you as soon as possible. And though the matter has been arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that it would have been impossible for us to wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This was how it happened. He is already of the rank of a court councilor, Peter Petrovich Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who has been very active in bringing the match about. He began by expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance, was properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent us a letter in which he very courteously explained his offer and begged for a speedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first, of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly and unexpectedly. We thought and deliberated the whole day. He is a well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government and has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years old, but he is of a fairly pleasing appearance and might still be thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat haughty. But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight. And beware, dear Rodia, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will do, beware of judging him too rashly and heatedly, as your way is, if there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I say this just in case, although I feel sure that he will make a favorable impression upon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must approach gradually and carefully to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas, which are very difficult to correct and remedy afterwards. And Peter Petrovich, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man. At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but still he shares, as he expressed it, many of ‘the convictions of our most rising generation’ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very little of it, but Dunia explained to me that, though he is not a man of great education, he is clever and, it seems, kind. You know your sister’s character, Rodia. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and generous girl, but she has an ardent heart, as I know very well. Of course, there is no great love either on his side or on hers, but Dunia, while a clever girl, is also a noble creature, like an angel, and will make it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her happiness his care, of which we have no good reason to doubt, though it must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, for himself that his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dunechka is with him. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even certain differences of opinion—which indeed are inevitable even in the happiest marriages—Dunechka has said that, as regards all that, she relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future relationship can be an honest and honorable one. He struck me too, for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For instance, at his second visit, after he had received Dunia’s consent, in the course of conversation, he declared that before making Dunia’s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of good reputation, but without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her benefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design, but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dunia. But Dunia was vexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ and that, of course, is perfectly true. Dunechka did not sleep all night before she made up her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before the icon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me that she had decided."
"– Да ведь я божьего промысла знать не могу… И к чему вы спрашиваете, чего нельзя спрашивать? К чему такие пустые вопросы? Как может случиться, чтоб это от моего решения зависело? И кто меня тут судьей поставил: кому жить, кому не жить?","- Why, I can’t know God’s providence ... And why do you ask, what shouldn’t be asked? Why such empty questions? How can it happen that it depends on my decision? And who put me here as a judge: who will live, who will not live?",“But I can’t know God’s plan. . . .

"– А меня прислала сестрица Соня, – отвечала девочка, еще веселее улыбаясь.","“And my sister Sonya sent me,” the girl answered, smiling even more cheerfully.","“My sister Sonya,” the little girl replied, smiling even more cheerfully.","‘It was my sister Sonia that sent me,’ replied the girl, smiling even more cheerfully.","“My sister Sonia sent me,” answered the girl, smiling still more brightly."

"– Застанем, застанем, – торопился Разумихин. – Это, брат, славный парень, увидишь! Неуклюж немного, то есть он человек и светский, но я в другом отношении говорю неуклюж. Малый умный, умный, очень даже неглупый, только какой-то склад мыслей особенный… Недоверчив, скептик, циник… надувать любит, то есть не надувать, а дурачить… Ну и материальный старый метод… А дело знает, знает… Он одно дело, прошлого года, такое об убийстве разыскал, в котором почти все следы были потеряны! Очень, очень, очень желает с тобой познакомиться!","“We’ll catch it, we’ll catch it,” Razumikhin hurried. - This, brother, is a nice guy, you will see! A little clumsy, that is, he is a man and a man of the world, but in another respect I say clumsy. Small smart, smart, not even stupid, only some sort of special way of thinking... Distrustful, skeptic, cynic... loves to cheat, that is, not to cheat, but to fool around... Well, the material old method... But he knows the business, he knows... He is one thing, last year, such a murder tracked down, in which almost all traces were lost! I really, really, really want to meet you!","“We will, we will,” Razumikhin hastened to say. “He’s a fine fellow, my friend, you’ll see! He’s a bit awkward; that is, he’s a worldly man, but in another sense, I say he’s awkward. He’s a clever fellow, clever, even very smart, only he has a special cast of mind. . . . He’s mistrustful, a skeptic, a cynic. . . . He loves to dupe people, that is, not dupe them, but fool them. . . . The old-style, physical method. . . . He knows his business, he does. . . . He was investigating a case of murder last year in which all the clues had been lost! He very, very, very much wants to make your acquaintance!” “Why do you say ‘very much?’ ” “That is, not to . .","‘Certainly, certainly,’ replied Razumikhin quickly. ‘ He’s a splendid chap, you’ll see! A bit awkward—I mean, he’s a society man too, but I meant awkward in a different sense. He’s very, very bright, not stupid at all, but he does have his own way of looking at things… he’s mistrustful, sceptical, cynical … he likes to mislead you, or rather make a fool of you… well, that’s a well-tried technique… But he knows his job, he certainly does… There was one case last year, a murder, which he cleared up when the trail had practically gone cold. He’s very, very, very keen to meet you!’","“Oh, yes,” Razumikhin answered quickly. “He’s a nice person, you’ll see, my friend. Pretty clumsy—that’s to say, he has real manners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He’s intelligent, very intelligent, in fact, but he has his own range of ideas . . . He is incredulous, skeptical, cynical . . . he likes to impose on people, or rather to make fun of them. His method is old, circumstantial . . . But he understands his work . . . thoroughly . . . Last year he cleared up a murder case the police had hardly a clue about. He is very, very anxious to meet you.”"
Это уже было невыносимо. Раскольников не вытерпел и злобно сверкнул на него загоревшимися гневом черными своими глазами. Тотчас же и опомнился.,It was already unbearable. Raskolnikov could not stand it and angrily flashed at him with his black eyes lit up with anger. I immediately remembered.,This was unbearable. Raskolnikov couldn’t refrain and cast him a vicious glance of rage with his flashing dark eyes. Then he recovered immediately.,This was quite intolerable. Raskolnikov couldn’t stop himself glaring viciously at him out of his dark eyes. But he recollected himself straight away.,"This was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately reverted to his previous demeanor."
"Раза два, впрочем, случилось, что она сама так навела разговор, что невозможно было, отвечая ей, не упомянуть о том, где именно находится теперь Родя; когда же ответы поневоле должны были выйти неудовлетворительными и подозрительными, она стала вдруг чрезвычайно печальна, угрюма и молчалива, что продолжалось весьма долгое время. Дуня увидела наконец, что трудно лгать и выдумывать, и пришла к окончательному заключению, что лучше уж совершенно молчать об известных пунктах; но все более и более становилось ясно до очевидности, что бедная мать подозревает что-то ужасное. Дуня припомнила, между прочим, слова брата, что мать вслушивалась в ее бред, в ночь накануне того последнего рокового дня, после сцены ее с Свидригайловым: не расслышала ли она чего-нибудь тогда? Часто, иногда после нескольких дней и даже недель угрюмого, мрачного молчания и безмолвных слез, больная как-то истерически оживлялась и начинала вдруг говорить вслух, почти не умолкая, о своем сыне, о своих надеждах, о будущем… Фантазии ее были иногда очень странны. Ее тешили, ей поддакивали (она сама, может быть, видела ясно, что ей поддакивают и только тешат ее), но она все-таки говорила…","Once or twice, however, it happened that she herself started the conversation in such a way that it was impossible, in answering her, not to mention exactly where Rodya was now; when, involuntarily, the answers should have turned out to be unsatisfactory and suspicious, she suddenly became extremely sad, gloomy and silent, which continued for a very long time. Dunya finally saw that it was difficult to lie and invent, and came to the final conclusion that it was better to be completely silent about certain points; but it became more and more obvious that the poor mother suspected something terrible. Dunya recalled, among other things, her brother's words that her mother had listened to her delirium on the night before that last fateful day, after her scene with Svidrigailov: hadn't she heard something then? Often, sometimes after several days and even weeks of gloomy, gloomy silence and silent tears, the patient somehow hysterically revived and suddenly began to speak aloud, almost without stopping, about her son, about her hopes, about the future ... Her fantasies were sometimes very strange . They amused her, they assented to her (she herself, perhaps, clearly saw that they were assenting to her and only amusing her), but she still said ...","Several times, however, it happened that she herself began a conversation in which it became impossible, in answering her, not to mention where Rodya was at the present time; when the replies were, of necessity, unsatisfactory and suspect, she suddenly became extremely sad, gloomy, and taciturn, which condition continued for a very long time. Finally Dunya realized that it was difficult to lie and invent a story; she arrived at the definitive conclusion that it was better to remain completely silent about certain points; but it was becoming clearer and clearer, to the point of obvious, that their poor mother suspected something awful. Dunya recalled, moreover, her brother’s words to the effect that her mother had overheard her nighttime raving on the eve of that last fateful day, after the scene with Svidrigaylov: had she perhaps found out something then? Often, sometimes after several days or even weeks of gloomy, morose silence and silent tears, the sick woman became hysterically agitated and suddenly began talking aloud, almost without pausing, about her son, her hopes for him, about his future. . . . Her fantasies were sometimes very strange. They would console her, humor her (she herself, perhaps, clearly saw that they were humoring her and merely consoling her), but still she talked . . .","On a couple of occasions her mother herself led the conversation round in a way that made it impossible to answer her without mentioning where exactly Rodia was now. When all the answers she got turned out to be unsatisfactory and suspicious, she became very sad, gloomy, and silent, and stayed so for a very long time. Eventually Dunia realized that it was hard to keep lying and inventing things, and made up her mind that on certain matters it was best to say nothing at all. But it became increasingly obvious that her poor mother suspected something terrible. She remembered hearing her brother say that their mother had overheard her talking in her sleep, the night before that last fateful day, after her scene with Svidrigailov. Could she have heard something then? It would often happen that after several days or even weeks of morose, gloomy silence and wordless tears, the sick woman would become hysterically cheerful and suddenly take to talking out loud, almost without stopping, about her son, her hopes, their future… Her fantasies were sometimes very strange. The others humoured her, agreeing with everything she said; perhaps she realized clearly enough that she was just being humoured, yet still she talked on…","Once or twice, however, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her without mentioning where Rodia was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and suspicious answers she immediately became gloomy and silent. Such moods would last for a long time. Dunia saw at last that it was hard to deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that the poor mother suspected something terrible. Dunia remembered her brother telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her sleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigailov and before the fatal day of the confession: had she not understood something from that? Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be followed by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would begin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his future . . . Her ideas were sometimes very strange. They humored her, pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending), but she still went on talking."
"– Что? – как бы проснулся тот, – да… ну и запачкался в крови, когда помогал его переносить в квартиру… Кстати, маменька, я одну непростительную вещь вчера сделал; подлинно не в своем был уме.

Papasha was a State Councillor, almost a Governor; he only had one more step to take—everyone would drive up to our house and say “We all regard you as our Governor already, Ivan Mikhailich.” When I… khhh! when I… khhh-khhh-khhh… Oh, curse this life!’ she cried, bringing up the phlegm and clutching her chest, ‘when I… oh, when I went to my last ball, at the Marshal’s… Princess Bezzemelnaya—who gave me her blessing later on, when I married your Papa, Polia—she saw me and straight away asked “Isn’t that the pretty young lady who did the shawl dance at the end of term?” … (That torn bit has got to be mended; you ought to get your needle and darn it straight away, as I taught you, otherwise… khhh! tomorrow… khhh-khhh-khhh! he’ll tear it even worse)’ she cried out over a fit of coughing. ‘ Prince Shchegolskoy, he was a Gentleman of the Bedchamber,* he’d only just arrived from Petersburg… he danced the mazurka with me,* and the very next day he wanted to drive to my house with a proposal of marriage; but I myself thanked him in the most flattering terms and said that my heart had long belonged to another. That other was your father, Polia. My Papenka was terribly cross… Is the water ready? All right, pass the shirt; and the stockings?… Lida,’—she turned to her younger daughter—‘you can sleep without a nightshirt tonight, you’ll manage somehow… and put your stockings there too … we’ll wash them all in one go… Why doesn’t that drunken tramp come home? He’s worn his shirt out till it’s more like some kind of dishrag, torn it to shreds… Better do it all together, and not wear myself out two nights running! Oh my God! Khhh-khhh-khhh-khhh! Not again! What’s this?’ she cried, looking at the crowd on the threshold and the people pushing their way into her room, carrying something. ‘ What’s this? What are they carrying? God Almighty!’","“You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking about the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin! Father was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; everyone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, Ivan Mikhailovich, as our governor!’ When I . . . when . . . ” she coughed violently, “oh, cursed life,” she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her breast, “when I . . . when at the last ball . . . at the marshal ’s . . .

What are they bringing? Lord have mercy!”"

"Он зажал двугривенный в руку, прошел шагов десять и оборотился лицом к Неве, по направлению дворца. Небо было без малейшего облачка, а вода почти голубая, что на Неве так редко бывает. Купол собора, который ни с какой точки не обрисовывается лучше, как смотря на него отсюда, с моста, не доходя шагов двадцать до часовни, так и сиял, и сквозь чистый воздух можно было отчетливо разглядеть даже каждое его украшение. Боль от кнута утихла, и Раскольников забыл про удар; одна беспокойная и не совсем ясная мысль занимала его теперь исключительно. Он стоял и смотрел вдаль долго и пристально; это место было ему особенно знакомо. Когда он ходил в университет, то обыкновенно, – чаще всего, возвращаясь домой, – случалось ему, может быть, раз сто, останавливаться именно на этом же самом месте, пристально вглядываться в эту действительно великолепную панораму и каждый раз почти удивляться одному неясному и неразрешимому своему впечатлению. Необъяснимым холодом веяло на него всегда от этой великолепной панорамы; духом немым и глухим полна была для него эта пышная картина… Дивился он каждый раз своему угрюмому и загадочному впечатлению и откладывал разгадку его, не доверяя себе, в будущее. Теперь вдруг резко вспомнил он про эти прежние свои вопросы и недоумения, и показалось ему, что не нечаянно он вспомнил теперь про них. Уж одно то показалось ему дико и чудно, что он на том же самом месте остановился, как прежде, как будто и действительно вообразил, что может о том же самом мыслить теперь, как и прежде, и такими же прежними темами и картинами интересоваться, какими интересовался… еще так недавно. Даже чуть не смешно ему стало, и в то же время сдавило грудь до боли. В какой-то глубине, внизу, где-то чуть видно под ногами, показалось ему теперь все это прежнее прошлое, и прежние мысли, и прежние задачи, и прежние темы, и прежние впечатления, и вся эта панорама, и он сам, и всё, всё… Казалось, он улетал куда-то вверх, и все исчезало в глазах его… Сделав одно невольное движение рукой, он вдруг ощутил в кулаке своем зажатый двугривенный. Он разжал руку, пристально поглядел на монетку, размахнулся и бросил ее в воду; затем повернулся и пошел домой. Ему показалось, что он как будто ножницами отрезал себя сам от всех и всего в эту минуту.","He clutched the two-knob in his hand, walked about ten steps and turned to face the Neva, in the direction of the palace. The sky was without the slightest cloud, and the water was almost blue, which is so rare on the Neva. The dome of the cathedral, which from any point is not outlined better, as looking at it from here, from the bridge, not reaching twenty paces to the chapel, shone, and through the clean air one could clearly see even its every decoration. The pain from the whip subsided, and Raskolnikov forgot about the blow; one restless and not entirely clear thought now occupied him exclusively. He stood and gazed into the distance for a long time and intently; this place was especially familiar to him. When he went to the university, then usually - most often, returning home - it happened to him, maybe a hundred times, to stop at this very place, to gaze intently at this really magnificent panorama and each time almost to be surprised at one obscure and insoluble your impression. An inexplicable cold was always blowing on him from this magnificent panorama; for him this magnificent picture was full of a dumb and deaf spirit ... Every time he marveled at his gloomy and mysterious impression and put off solving it, not trusting himself, into the future. Now he suddenly remembered sharply these previous questions and perplexities of his, and it seemed to him that it was not by accident that he now remembered about them. One thing seemed to him wild and wonderful that he had stopped at the same place as before, as if he had really imagined that he could think about the same thing now as before, and be interested in the same old themes and pictures as I was interested ... not so long ago. He even felt almost ridiculous, and at the same time squeezed his chest to the point of pain. In some depths, below, somewhere barely visible underfoot, it seemed to him now all this old past, and former thoughts, and former tasks, and former themes, and former impressions, and this whole panorama, and he himself, and everything, everything ... It seemed that he was flying away somewhere upward, and everything disappeared in his eyes ... Having made one involuntary movement of his hand, he suddenly felt a two-knuckle clutch in his fist. He unclenched his hand, gazed intently at the coin, swung it and threw it into the water; then turned and walked home. It seemed to him that he seemed to cut himself off from everyone and everything with scissors at that moment.","He squeezed the coin in his hand, walked on about ten paces, and turned to face the Neva in the direction of the palace. The sky had not the slightest trace of any cloud and the water looked almost blue, which rarely happens at the Neva. The dome of the cathedral, the outline of which could not appear more conspicuously from any other point of view than this spot on the bridge, some twenty paces from the chapel, was gleaming; through the clear air one could discern every last detail of its decoration. The pain from the whip’s lash had eased, and Raskolnikov forgot all about the blow; one anxious and somewhat hazy thought now preoccupied him exclusively. He stood there and gazed into the distance intently and for a long time; this place was very familiar to him. When he’d been attending classes at the university, ordinarily—most often, on his way home—perhaps as many as a hundred times, he’d happened to pause precisely at this spot and stare fixedly at that genuinely majestic panorama; each and every time he would marvel at his own indistinct and inexplicable impression. An unaccountable chill always came over him as a result of this splendid sight; for him, this opulent picture was filled with a deaf and mute spirit. . . . He was surprised each time by this gloomy and enigmatic impression; not trusting himself, he would defer its solution to the future. All of a sudden, he recalled abruptly his former questions and perplexity, and it seemed that this was all happening now for some good reason. It was strange and mysterious that he had paused at the very same place as before, as if he really imagined that he could think about the same things now as he had then, that the same subjects and images could interest him as they had before . . . not so long ago. It even struck him as almost amusing, while at the same time he felt somewhat heartsick. Somewhere down below, in the depths, visible just beneath his feet, he seemed to see all of his recent past, his previous thoughts, previous problems, previous subjects, previous impressions, this entire panorama, even himself, and everything else, everything. . . . He seemed to soar somewhere upward, and then everything disappeared from sight. . . . After making an involuntary movement of his hand, he suddenly felt the twenty-kopeck piece grasped tightly in his fist. He opened his hand, stared intently at the coin, wound up his arm, and threw it into the water; then he turned around and went home. It seemed as if at that very moment he had cut himself off with a pair of scissors from everyone and everything.","He clenched the coin in his hand, walked on a dozen paces, and turned towards the Neva, facing the palace. There was not the smallest cloud in the sky, and the water was almost blue, which so rarely happens on the Neva. The cathedral dome,* which nowhere shows up better than when viewed from this spot on the bridge, twenty paces short of the chapel, was simply glowing, and through the clear air he could easily make out every detail of its ornamentation. The pain from the whip had eased, and Raskolnikov had forgotten about it. There was just one troubling but quite vague thought that preoccupied him now, to the exclusion of all else. He was standing there, gazing long and hard into the distance; this place was a particularly familiar one to him. When attending the university, he would usually stop at this precise spot, particularly on his way home; this might have happened as many as a hundred times. He would stare hard at this truly magnificent prospect, and almost every time he would wonder at one particular, indistinct, and puzzling impression. He always felt an inexplicable breath of cold air on him as he stood before this magnificent prospect; for him, the imposing spectacle was permeated by a deaf and mute spirit. * He wondered every time at the mysterious, sombre impression he experienced, and—not trusting himself—would put off trying to explain it. And suddenly now he sharply recalled the questions and problems that had troubled him in the past, and felt that it was no accident that they had come to his mind again. The very fact that he had stopped at the same spot where he always used to, struck him as peculiar and bizarre—as though he could really imagine himself capable of thinking the same thoughts as before, and being interested in the same questions and images now, as those that had preoccupied him… such a short time ago. It seemed almost absurd—yet at the same time it gave him a painful tightness in his chest. All this past life of his, all his past thoughts, and past preoccupations, and past ideas, and past impressions, and this whole view, and he himself, and all of it, all of it—he seemed to see it all somewhere far below him, down in the depths, somewhere out of sight down there. He felt as if he was flying up and away, and everything was vanishing before his eyes… He made an involuntary movement with his arm, and suddenly became aware of the twenty-kopek piece clutched in his fist. He opened his hand, stared hard at the money, drew his arm back, and flung the coin into the water; then he turned and set off homeward. He felt that he had in that moment cut himself off from everyone and everything, as though with scissors.","He closed his hand on the twenty kopecks, walked on for ten paces, and turned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was cloudless and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the Neva. The dome of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight, and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished. The pain from the lash eased off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one uneasy and not quite definite idea now occupied him completely. He stood still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was especially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had hundreds of times—generally on his way home—stood still on this spot, gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marveled at a vague and mysterious emotion it aroused in him. It left him strangely cold; for him, this gorgeous picture was blank and lifeless. He wondered every time at his somber and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting himself, put off finding an explanation for it. He vividly recalled those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and grotesque that he should have stopped at the same spot as before, as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him . . . so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his heart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him now—all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories, his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all . . . He felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing from his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep his arm flung it into the water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut himself off from every one and from everything at that moment."
"Несмотря на эти странные слова, ему стало очень тяжело. Он присел на оставленную скамью. Мысли его были рассеянны… Да и вообще тяжело ему было думать в эту минуту о чем бы то ни было. Он бы хотел совсем забыться, все забыть, потом проснуться и начать совсем сызнова…","Despite these strange words, it became very difficult for him. He sat down on an abandoned bench. His thoughts were scattered ... And in general it was hard for him to think about anything at that moment. He would like to completely forget, forget everything, then wake up and start all over again ...","In spite of these strange words, he felt very wretched. He sat down on the deserted bench. His thoughts were scattered. . . . In general, it was hard for him at that moment to think about anything at all. He wanted to sink into forgetfulness, to forget everything, then wake up and start all over again.","Despite these strange words, he felt very downcast. He sat down on the empty bench, thinking confused thoughts… At that moment he felt too gloomy to think about anything at all. He would have liked to sink into oblivion, forget everything, then wake up and start afresh.","In spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down on the deserted bench. His thought strayed aimlessly . . . In fact he found it hard to fix his mind on anything at that moment.

"– Одним словом, – настойчиво и громко сказал он, вставая и немного оттолкнув при этом Порфирия, – одним словом, я хочу знать: признаете ли вы меня окончательно свободным от подозрений или нет? Говорите, Порфирий Петрович, говорите положительно и окончательно, и скорее, сейчас!","“In a word,” he said insistently and loudly, getting up and at the same time pushing Porfiry a little away, “in a word, I want to know: do you recognize me completely free from suspicion or not? Speak, Porfiry Petrovich, speak positively and definitively, and quickly, now!","“In a word,” he said in a loud, insistent voice, standing up and pushing Porfiry away slightly as he stood, “in a word, I want to know: do you acknowledge that I’m completely free of suspicion or not?

Tell me that, Porfiry Petrovich, tell me once and for all, now, at once!’ ‘My, what a fuss!","“Briefly,” he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet and in so doing pushing Porfiry back a little, “briefly, I want to know, do you acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not? Tell me, Porfiry Petrovich, hurry up and tell me once and for all!”"
"Он глубоко задумался о том: «каким же это процессом может так произойти, что он, наконец, пред всеми ими уже без рассуждений смирится, убеждением смирится! А что ж, почему ж и нет? Конечно, так и должно быть. Разве двадцать лет беспрерывного гнета не добьют окончательно? Вода камень точит. И зачем, зачем же жить после этого, зачем я иду теперь, когда сам знаю, что все это будет именно так, как по книге, а не иначе!»","He thought deeply about: “What kind of process can happen so that he finally humbles himself before all of them without reasoning, humbles himself with conviction! Well, why not? Of course, that's how it should be. Wouldn't twenty years of uninterrupted oppression finally finish off? Water wears away the stone. And why, why live after this, why am I going now, when I myself know that all this will be exactly as according to the book, and not otherwise!","He fell to thinking deeply about how it might transpire that at last he’d humble himself before them all without any argument, humble himself by conviction! And why not? Of course, that’s how it must be. Won’t twenty years of uninterrupted oppression finish him off? Water wears away a stone. And why, why live after this? “Why am I going now, when I myself know that all of it will be just as it is in the books, and not any different?”","He fell to thinking hard about this question: what process could ever finally and completely reconcile him to his fate, without reservation, out of genuine conviction, in the face of all those other people? ‘But no, why ever not? Of course, that’s how it has to be. Won’t twenty years of unrelenting oppression end up by crushing me? Water wears away a stone. And if that’s so, what on earth is the point of living , why am I going there now, when I know myself that’s exactly how it’s going to be, all according to the book, and no other way!’","He start imagining the process which would accomplish it, that he could be humbled before all of them, indiscriminately—humbled by conviction. And yet why not? It must be so. Would not twenty years of continual servitude crush him utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why should he live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that it would be so?"
"– Кровь!.. Какая кровь?.. – бормотал он, бледнея и отодвигаясь к стене. Настасья продолжала молча смотреть на него.","- Blood! .. What blood? .. - he muttered, turning pale and moving away to the wall. Nastasya continued to stare at him in silence.","“Blood! What blood?” he muttered, growing pale and moving toward the wall. Nastasya continued staring at him.","‘Blood!… What blood?…’ he gabbled, turning pale and recoiling towards the wall. Nastasia went on looking silently at him.","“Blood?

"– Ну, если так, – даже с некоторым удивлением ответил Свидригайлов, рассматривая Раскольникова, – если так, то вы и сами порядочный циник. Материал, по крайней мере, заключаете в себе огромный. Сознавать много можете, много… ну да вы и делать-то много можете. Ну, однако ж, довольно. Искренно жалею, что с вами мало переговорил, да вы от меня не уйдете… Вот подождите только…","“Well, if so,” Svidrigailov even replied with some surprise, examining Raskolnikov, “if so, then you yourself are a decent cynic.

Just wait a little . . .”","‘Well, if that’s how you take it,’ replied Svidrigailov in some surprise, looking at Raskolnikov, ‘if so, you’re a pretty fair cynic yourself. At least, you have all the makings of a terrific one. You can take in a lot of things… well, and you can achieve a lot too. Anyway, enough of that. I’m truly sorry we haven’t managed to have much of a chat; but I’m not going to lose touch… Only wait a bit…’","“Well, if you come to that,” Svidrigailov answered, scrutinizing Raskolnikov with some surprise, “if you come to that, you are a thorough cynic yourself.

I sincerely regret not having talked to you more, but I shan’t lose sight of you . . . Just wait a bit.”"
"Между разговором Раскольников пристально ее разглядывал. Это было худенькое, совсем худенькое и бледное личико, довольно неправильное, какое-то востренькое, с востреньким маленьким носом и подбородком. Ее даже нельзя было назвать и хорошенькою, но зато голубые глаза ее были такие ясные, и когда оживлялись они, выражение лица ее становилось такое доброе и простодушное, что невольно привлекало к ней. В лице ее, да и во всей ее фигуре, была сверх того одна особенная характерная черта: несмотря на свои восемнадцать лет, она казалась почти еще девочкой, гораздо моложе своих лет, совсем почти ребенком, и это иногда даже смешно проявлялось в некоторых ее движениях.","Between conversations, Raskolnikov looked at her intently. It was a thin, very thin and pale face, rather irregular, somewhat pointed, with a pointed little nose and chin. She could not even be called pretty, but her blue eyes were so clear, and when they were animated, her expression became so kind and simple-hearted that involuntarily attracted to her. In her face, and indeed in her whole figure, there was, moreover, one special characteristic feature: in spite of her eighteen years, she seemed almost still a girl, much younger than her age, almost a child, and this was sometimes even comically manifested in some of her movements. .","During the conversation Raskolnikov examined her closely. She had a thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular, somewhat angular, with a pointed little nose and chin. It was even impossible to think of her as pretty; on the other hand, her blue eyes were so clear and, when they came to life, the expression of her face so kind and sincere, that one felt involuntarily attracted to her. There was, in addition, one special trait reflected in her face and in her entire figure: in spite of her eighteen years, she still seemed like a young girl, much younger than her years, almost a total child, and that fact sometimes appeared engagingly in several of her movements.","Raskolnikov had been examining her closely during this exchange. Her little face was thin, very thin and pale, with rather irregular features, a bit pinched, with a pinched little nose and chin. She couldn’t even have been called pretty, but her blue eyes were so bright, and when they livened up, her expression became so kind and simple-hearted that one was immediately charmed by her. And there was something else very characteristic about her face, and her whole person: although she was eighteen, she still looked like a little girl, much younger than her years, almost a child in fact; and this sometimes came out rather comically in her movements too.","During the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had a thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a sharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty, but her blue eyes were so clear, and when they lit up there was such a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help being attracted. Her face, and her whole figure in fact, had another peculiar characteristic. In spite of the fact that she was eighteen years old, she looked almost like a little girl—almost like a child. And in some of her gestures this childishness seemed almost absurd."
"В контору надо было идти все прямо и при втором повороте взять влево: она была тут в двух шагах. Но, дойдя до первого поворота, он остановился, подумал, поворотил в переулок и пошел обходом, через две улицы, – может быть, безо всякой цели, а может быть, чтобы хоть минуту еще протянуть и выиграть время. Он шел и смотрел в землю. Вдруг как будто кто шепнул ему что-то на ухо. Он поднял голову и увидал, что стоит у того дома, у самых ворот.

"– Да вы не раздражайтесь, – засмеялся через силу Зосимов, – предположите, что вы мой первый пациент, ну а наш брат, только что начинающий практиковать, своих первых пациентов, как собственных детей, любит, а иные почти в них влюбляются.

"Он, впрочем, правду сказал, когда проврался давеча спьяну на лестнице, что эксцентрическая хозяйка Раскольникова, Прасковья Павловна, приревнует его не только к Авдотье Романовне, но, пожалуй, и к самой Пульхерии Александровне. Несмотря на то, что Пульхерии Александровне было уже сорок три года, лицо ее все еще сохраняло в себе остатки прежней красоты, и к тому же она казалась гораздо моложе своих лет, что бывает почти всегда с женщинами, сохранившими ясность духа, свежесть впечатлений и честный, чистый жар сердца до старости. Скажем в скобках, что сохранить все это есть единственное средство не потерять красоты своей даже в старости. Волосы ее уже начинали седеть и редеть, маленькие лучистые морщинки уже давно появились около глаз, щеки впали и высохли от заботы и горя, и все-таки это лицо было прекрасно. Это был портрет Дунечкинова лица, только двадцать лет спустя, да кроме еще выражения нижней губки, которая у ней не выдавалась вперед. Пульхерия Александровна была чувствительна, впрочем не до приторности, робка и уступчива, но до известной черты: она многое могла уступить, на многое могла согласиться, даже из того, что противоречило ее убеждению, но всегда была такая черта честности, правил и крайних убеждений, за которую никакие обстоятельства не могли заставить ее переступить.","He, however, told the truth when he lied drunk on the stairs just now that Raskolnikov's eccentric mistress, Praskovya Pavlovna, would be jealous of him not only for Avdotya Romanovna, but, perhaps, for Pulcheria Alexandrovna herself. Despite the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna was already forty-three years old, her face still retained the remnants of its former beauty, and besides, she seemed much younger than her years, which almost always happens with women who have retained clarity of spirit, freshness of impressions and honest , pure heat of the heart to old age. Let's say in brackets that to preserve all this is the only way not to lose one's beauty even in old age. Her hair was already beginning to turn gray and thin, small radiant wrinkles had long since appeared around her eyes, her cheeks were sunken and dried up from care and grief, and yet this face was beautiful. It was a portrait of Dunechkin's face, only twenty years later, and besides the expression of her lower lip, which did not protrude forward. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was sensitive, however, not to the point of cloying, timid and compliant, but to a certain extent: she could give in a lot, she could agree to a lot, even from what contradicted her convictions, but there was always such a trait of honesty, rules and extreme convictions, beyond which no circumstances could force her to cross.","However, he’d been telling the truth when, in his drunken state, he’d blurted out on the stairs that Raskolnikov’s eccentric landlady, Praskovya Pavlovna, was jealous of him, not only with respect to Avdotya Romanovna, but perhaps also to Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna herself. In spite of the fact that Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna was already forty-three years old, her face still preserved traces of her former beauty; besides, she seemed much younger than her years, something that happens almost always with women who maintain their clarity of spirit, freshness of impressions, and honest, pure intensity of heart as they age. Let us add in parentheses that to maintain all this is the only way to preserve one’s beauty even in old age. Her hair was already starting to turn gray and grow thin; small, radiating wrinkles had appeared around her eyes some time ago; her cheeks were sunken and dry from her cares and grief; and yet her face was still beautiful. It was the image of Dunya, only twenty years later, except for the look of her lower lip, since hers did not protrude. Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna was sensitive, though not to the point of affectation. She was shy and compliant, but only to a certain extent. She could concede a great deal, agree to many things, even those that contradicted her convictions, but there was always a limit to her honesty, her rules, and her deepest convictions that no circumstances would ever force her to cross.","The words he had drunkenly blurted out on the stairs that evening, claiming that Raskolnikov’s eccentric landlady Praskovia Pavlovna would be jealous not only of him and Avdotya Romanovna, but even jealous of his relations with Pulkheria Alexandrovna herself—those words had actually been true. Despite the fact that Pulkheria Alexandrovna was all of forty-three years old, her face still retained traces of her former beauty, and she looked much younger than her age; this is almost always true of those women who, as they grow old, preserve their clarity of mind, the freshness of their impressions, and a pure and honest ardour of the heart. Let us add in passing that preserving all these qualities is the only way to avoid losing one’s beauty even in old age. Her hair was already growing thin and grey, little radiating wrinkles had long ago appeared around her eyes, her cheeks were sunken and withered with grief and care; and yet her face was beautiful. It was a portrait of Dunechka’s face in twenty years to come, save for the expression of that lower lip which in the mother’s case did not project forwards. Pulkheria Alexandrovna was a sentimental woman, though not in a mawkish way; she was timid and yielding, but only up to a point; capable of yielding much, consenting to much, even if it went against her convictions; but there was always a bedrock of honesty, principle, and firm assurance which nothing would make her overstep.","He had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken talk on the stairs that Praskovia Pavlovna, Raskolnikov’s eccentric landlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of Avdotia Romanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was forty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she looked much younger than her age, in fact, which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart into old age. We may add in parenthesis that to preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty into old age. Her hair had begun to grow gray and thin, there had long been little crow’s foot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face. She was Dunia over again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and yielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions which nothing would induce her to cross."

Can it possibly be that you still haven’t received any news?” asked Petr Petrovich, somewhat taken aback.","‘How is this? Have you really not heard anything about me before now?’ asked Piotr Petrovich, looking uncomfortable.","But Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he was hearing the name of Peter Petrovich for the first time. “Is it possible that you can up until now have received no information?” asked Peter Petrovich, somewhat confused."

"– Вот с нею я много переговорил и об этом, с нею одной, – произнес он вдумчиво, – ее сердцу я много сообщил из того, что потом так безобразно сбылось. Не беспокойся, – обратился он к Дуне, – она не согласна была, как и ты, и я рад, что ее уж нет. Главное, главное в том, что все теперь пойдет по-новому, переломится надвое, – вскричал он вдруг, опять возвращаясь к тоске своей, – все, все, а приготовлен ли я к тому? Хочу ли я этого сам? Это, говорят, для моего испытания нужно! К чему, к чему все эти бессмысленные испытания? К чему они, лучше ли я буду сознавать тогда, раздавленный муками, идиотством, в старческом бессилии после двадцатилетней каторги, чем теперь сознаю, и к чему мне тогда и жить? Зачем я теперь-то соглашаюсь так жить? О, я знал, что я подлец, когда я сегодня, на рассвете, стоял над Невой!","“I talked a lot with her about this, too, with her alone,” he said thoughtfully, “I told her heart a lot of what then so ugly came true. Don’t worry,” he turned to Duna, “she didn’t agree, just like you, and I’m glad that she’s gone. The main thing, the main thing, is that everything will now go on in a new way, it will break in two,” he suddenly cried out, again returning to his anguish, “everything, everything, but am I prepared for that? Do I want it myself? This, they say, is necessary for my test! Why, why all these senseless trials? Why are they, would I be better aware then, crushed by torment, idiocy, in senile impotence after twenty years of penal servitude, than I now realize, and why should I live then? Why am I now agreeing to live like this? Oh, I knew that I was a scoundrel, when today, at dawn, I was standing over the Neva!","“I talked to her a great deal about that, only with her,” he said pensively. “I confided to her heart much of what later turned out so monstrously. Don’t be upset,” he said, turning to Dunya. “She didn’t agree with me, just as you don’t, and I’m glad that she’s no longer with us. The main thing is that now everything will proceed in a new direction; everything will be split into two parts,” he cried suddenly, sinking into melancholy once again. “Everything, everything; am I ready for that? Do I want that myself? They say it’s necessary for my ordeal! Why, why all these meaningless ordeals? What’s their purpose? Will I be better if I acknowledge then, crushed by suffering and idiocy, in old-age impotence after twenty years of exile, what I acknowledge now, and why should I continue to live? Why do I agree now to live like this? Oh, I knew that I was a wretch when I stood today above the Neva at daybreak!”","‘She was someone I often talked to, about all that, too—to her alone,’ he said thoughtfully; ‘I confided to her heart much of what later turned out so horribly. Don’t worry,’ he added to Dunia, ‘she didn’t agree with me, any more than you do, and I’m glad she’s not here any more. The main thing, the main thing is that everything is going to turn out differently now.—My life will be snapped in two!’ he suddenly cried out in fresh despair. ‘ Everything, everything—but am I ready for that? Is that what I want, myself? They say that’s necessary for my suffering! What’s the point, what on earth is the point of all these useless tribulations? What purpose do they serve? Shall I be better able to understand things then, when I’m crushed by suffering and idiocy, when I’m a helpless old man, after twenty years in a labour camp, than I understand them now? So what’s the point of living, then? Why am I consenting to live like that now? Oh, I knew I was a miserable wretch, when I stood on the banks of the Neva at dawn this morning!’","“I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her,” he said thoughtfully. “To her heart I confided much of what has since been so hideously realized. Don’t be uneasy,” he returned to Dunia, “she was as much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone. The great point is that everything now is going to be different, is going to be broken in two,” he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection. “Everything, everything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want it myself? They say it is necessary for me to suffer! What’s the object of these senseless sufferings? Shall I know any better what they are for, when I am crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty years’ penal servitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I consenting to that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stood looking at the Neva at daybreak today!”"

"– Дело длинное, Авдотья Романовна. Тут, как бы вам это выразить, своего рода теория, то же самое дело, по которому я нахожу, например, что единичное злодейство позволительно, если главная цель хороша. Единственное зло и сто добрых дел! Оно тоже, конечно, обидно для молодого человека с достоинствами и с самолюбием непомерным знать, что были бы, например, всего только тысячи три, и вся карьера, все будущее в его жизненной цели формируется иначе, а между тем нет этих трех тысяч. Прибавьте к этому раздражение от голода, от тесной квартиры, от рубища, от яркого сознания красоты своего социального положения, а вместе с тем положения сестры и матери. Пуще же всего тщеславие, гордость и тщеславие, а впрочем, бог его знает, может, и при хороших наклонностях… Я ведь его не виню, не думайте, пожалуйста; да и не мое дело. Тут была тоже одна собственная теорийка, – так себе теория, – по которой люди разделяются, видите ли, на материал и на особенных людей, то есть на таких людей, для которых, по их высокому положению, закон не писан, а, напротив, которые сами сочиняют законы остальным людям, материалу-то, сору-то. Ничего, так себе теорийка; une théorie сommе une autre.[88] Наполеон его ужасно увлек, то есть собственно увлекло его то, что очень многие гениальные люди на единичное зло не смотрели, а шагали через, не задумываясь. Он, кажется, вообразил себе, что и он гениальный человек, – то есть был в том некоторое время уверен. Он очень страдал и теперь страдает от мысли, что теорию-то сочинить он умел, а перешагнуть-то, не задумываясь, и не в состоянии, стало быть человек не гениальный. Ну, а уж это для молодого человека с самолюбием и унизительно, в наш век-то особенно…","“It’s a long matter, Avdotya Romanovna. Here, how would you put it, is a kind of theory, the same case in which I find, for example, that a single villainy is permissible if the main goal is good. The only evil and a hundred good deeds! It is also, of course, insulting for a young man with dignity and exorbitant pride to know that, for example, there would be only three thousand, and the whole career, the whole future in his life goal is shaped differently, but meanwhile there are no these three thousand. Add to this irritation from hunger, from a cramped apartment, from rags, from a vivid awareness of the beauty of one's social position, and at the same time the position of a sister and mother. Most of all, vanity, pride and vanity, and besides, God knows, maybe with good inclinations ... I don’t blame him, don’t think, please; yeah, it's none of my business. Here, too, there was one theory of its own, a so-so theory, according to which people are divided, you see, into material and into special people, that is, into such people for whom, according to their high position, the law is not written, but, on the contrary, who themselves compose laws for the rest of the people, for the material, for the rubbish. Nothing, so-so theory; une theorie comme une autre.[88] Napoleon fascinated him terribly, that is, he was actually fascinated by the fact that so many brilliant people did not look at a single evil, but walked through without thinking. He seems to have imagined that he, too, was a man of genius—that is, he was sure of that for some time. He suffered greatly and now suffers from the thought that he was able to compose a theory, but to step over something without hesitation, and is not able, therefore, the person is not a genius. Well, and this is for a young man with pride and humiliating, especially in our age ...","“It’s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. How can I explain it to you? There’s a kind of theory involved, according to which one finds, for example, that a single crime is permissible if the main goal is a good one. A single evil act and a hundred good deeds! Besides, it’s infuriating for a young man of merit and inordinate pride to know that if only he had some three thousand rubles, his entire career, the future course of his life would be different; meanwhile he lacks the three thousand rubles. Add to this irascibility from hunger, from cramped quarters, from ragged clothes, from the clear consciousness of the beauty of his social position, together with that of his sister and his mother. Worst of all, vanity, pride and vanity; however, God only knows there might also be some good proclivities. . . . Don’t think I blame him ; it’s none of my business. There was also this particular little theory of his—an ordinary one—according to which people are divided, don’t you see, into raw material and special people, that is, people for whom, by means of their high position, the law has not been written; on the contrary, these people themselves create the law for others, for the raw material, the rabble. Well, it’s not bad as a little theory; une théorie comme une autre. * Napoleon enthralled him immensely, that is to say, he was fascinated that so very many men of genius didn’t pay any attention to a single evil act, but advanced over them, without even thinking. Apparently, he also imagined himself to be a man of genius— that is, he was convinced of it for some time. He suffered a great deal and even now suffers from the thought that he was able to devise a theory but was incapable of stepping over obstacles without thinking; therefore, he was not a man of genius. Well, and for a young man with such self-esteem, this was humiliating, especially in our day . . .”","‘It’s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. There was, how can I put it, a kind of theory behind it—just as I would consider, for instance, that a single wicked deed can be allowed if the main motive for it is good. A single evil deed and a hundred good ones! And then, of course, it’s galling for a young man of good qualities and overwhelming self-esteem to know that if he only had, say, an extra three thousand roubles, then his whole career, and the whole course of his future life, would be transformed— but he just hasn’t got those three thousand roubles. Add to that the stress of hunger, his tiny room, his ragged clothing, and his vivid awareness of his good social position; plus the situation of his sister and his mother. More than anything else, it’s a matter of vanity—pride and vanity; and perhaps, God knows, with the best of intentions… For I’m not blaming him, please don’t think that I am; in any case it’s not my business. A special little theory of his own came into it too, a kind of theory—according to which the human race is divided, if you follow me, into the common herd and extraordinary individuals, that is, the sort of people who, because of their exalted position, aren’t subject to laws; in fact they’re the ones who write the laws for the rest of humanity, the common herd, the rubbish heap. It’ll do, it’s a theory of a sort, une théorie comme une autre. He was very much carried away by Napoleon; or rather, he was carried away by the idea that a great many people of genius took no account of individual evil deeds, they strode over them without a thought. And I believe he imagined that he was a man of genius; I mean, he was convinced of that for a time. He suffered a great deal, and still suffers, from the thought that although he was capable of formulating his theory, he wasn’t capable of striding over those obstacles without a thought—which meant that he wasn’t a man of genius. Well, and that’s humiliating for a young man with great self-esteem, particularly in this day and age…’","“It’s a long story, Avdotia Romanovna.

It’s galling too, of course, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if he had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three thousand. Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging in a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his social position and his sister’s and mother’s position too. Above all, vanity, pride and vanity, though goodness knows he may have good qualities too . . . I am not blaming him , please don’t think it; besides, it’s not my business.

It’s all right as a theory , une théorie comme une autre.71 Napoleon attracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that a great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have overstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied that he was a genius too—that is, he was convinced of it for a time. He has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law, and so he is not a man of genius.

Я тебя просто за пьяного и принимал, да ты и был пьян», – ну, что я вам тогда на это скажу, тем паче что ваше-то еще правдоподобнее, чем его, потому что в его показании одна психология, – что его рылу даже и неприлично, – а вы-то в самую точку попадаете, потому что пьет, мерзавец, горькую и слишком даже известен. Да и сам я вам откровенно признавался, уже несколько раз, что психология эта о двух концах и что второй-то конец больше будет, да и гораздо правдоподобнее, а что, кроме этого, против вас у меня пока и нет ничего.

I just took you for a drunk and took you, and you were drunk, ”well, what will I tell you then, all the more so since yours is even more plausible than his, because there is only one psychology in his testimony - that his snout even indecent, but you hit the nail on the head, because he drinks, the bastard, bitter and is even too famous. Yes, and I myself have frankly admitted to you, already several times, that this psychology has two ends and that the second end will be larger, and much more plausible, and that, besides this, I have nothing against you yet.

I merely took you for a drunk, but you really were drunk.’ What would I reply to you then, all the more so since your version’s more credible than his, because his testimony is pure psychology—which doesn’t fit his mug at all—while you hit it right on the mark, because that scoundrel drinks heavily and that’s even very well known. And I myself confessed to you candidly, several times already, that this psychology cuts both ways, and the second way is greater and more credible than the first; and, besides that, I have nothing more against you at this time. And even though I still intend to arrest you, and even came (not in the usual way) to tell you everything in advance, still I can say candidly (also not in the usual way), that this would not be advantageous for me.

I just took you for a drunk, and so you were”—well, how could I answer that, particularly since your story will be more plausible than his, because there’s nothing but psychology to back up his evidence—which doesn’t look at all good, with a mug like his— while what you say will be spot on, because he does drink, the villain, he drinks like a fish and he’s well known for it. Moreover, I’ve admitted to you quite frankly, more than once, that all this psychology cuts both ways, and the opposite interpretation will carry much more weight and conviction. Besides which, I don’t have anything against you right now. And even if I am actually going to arrest you, and though I’ve come along myself (against all the rules) to warn you in advance, even so I’m telling you frankly (also against the rules) that it won’t do me any good.

I simply thought you were drunk, and you were drunk, too.’ Well, what could I answer, especially as your story is a more likely one than his, for there’s nothing but psychology to support his evidence—that’s almost unseemly with his ugly mug, while you hit the mark exactly, because that rascal is an inveterate drunkard, and notoriously so.

"– Извините, я тоже неостроумен, – резко перебил Разумихин, – а потому перестанемте.

"Свидригайлов поил и Катю, и шарманщика, и песенников, и лакеев, и двух каких-то писаришек. С этими писаришками он связался, собственно, потому, что оба они были с кривыми носами: у одного нос шел криво вправо, а у другого влево. Это поразило Свидригайлова. Они увлекли его, наконец, в какой-то увеселительный сад, где он заплатил за них и за вход. В этом саду была одна тоненькая, трехлетняя елка и три кустика. Кроме того, выстроен был «вокзал»,[89] в сущности распивочная, но там можно было получать и чай, да сверх того стояли несколько зеленых столиков и стульев. Хор скверных песенников и какой-то пьяный мюнхенский немец вроде паяца, с красным носом, но отчего-то чрезвычайно унылый, увеселяли публику. Писаришки поссорились с какими-то другими писаришками и затеяли было драку. Свидригайлов выбран был ими судьей. Он судил их уже с четверть часа, но они так кричали, что не было ни малейшей возможности что-нибудь разобрать. Вернее всего было то, что один из них что-то украл и даже успел тут же продать какому-то подвернувшемуся жиду; но, продав, не захотел поделиться с своим товарищем. Оказалось, наконец, что проданный предмет была чайная ложка, принадлежавшая вокзалу. В вокзале хватились ее, и дело стало принимать размеры хлопотливые. Свидригайлов заплатил за ложку, встал и вышел из сада. Было часов около десяти. Сам он не выпил во все это время ни одной капли вина и всего только спросил себе в вокзале чаю, да и то больше для порядка. Между тем вечер был душный и мрачный. К десяти часам надвинулись со всех сторон страшные тучи; ударил гром, и дождь хлынул, как водопад. Вода падала не каплями, а целыми струями хлестала на землю. Молния сверкала поминутно, и можно было сосчитать до пяти раз в продолжение каждого зарева. Весь промокший до нитки, дошел он домой, заперся, отворил свое бюро, вынул все свои деньги и разорвал две-три бумаги. Затем, сунув деньги в карман, он хотел было переменить на себе платье, но, посмотрев в окно и прислушавшись к грозе и дождю, махнул рукой, взял шляпу и вышел, не заперев квартиры. Он прошел прямо к Соне. Та была дома.","Svidrigailov gave water to Katya, and the organ grinder, and songwriters, and lackeys, and some two scribes. He got in touch with these clerks, in fact, because they both had crooked noses: one had a crooked nose to the right, and the other to the left. This struck Svidrigailov. They dragged him at last to some pleasure garden, where he paid for them and for entry. In this garden there was one thin, three-year-old tree and three bushes. In addition, a ""station"" was built,[89] essentially a drinking-room, but one could also get tea there, and besides, there were several green tables and chairs. A chorus of bad songwriters and some drunken German from Munich, like a clown, with a red nose, but for some reason extremely dull, amused the audience. The clerks quarreled with some other clerks and started a fight. Svidrigailov was chosen by them as a judge. He had been judging them for a quarter of an hour, but they were shouting so loudly that there was not the slightest possibility of making out anything. The most certain thing was that one of them stole something and even managed to immediately sell it to some Jew who turned up; but, having sold, did not want to share with his friend. It finally turned out that the item sold was a teaspoon that belonged to the station. At the station they missed her, and the matter began to take on troublesome dimensions. Svidrigailov paid for the spoon, got up and left the garden. It was about ten o'clock. He himself did not drink a single drop of wine during all this time and only asked himself tea at the station, and even then more for the sake of order. Meanwhile, the evening was stuffy and gloomy. By ten o'clock terrible clouds had moved in from all sides; thunder struck, and the rain poured down like a waterfall. The water did not fall in drops, but in whole streams whipped to the ground. The lightning flashed every minute, and it was possible to count up to five times during each glow. Soaked to the skin, he went home, locked himself, opened his bureau, took out all his money and tore two or three papers. Then, putting money in his pocket, he was about to change his dress, but, looking out the window and listening to the thunder and rain, he waved his hand, took his hat and went out without locking the apartment. He went straight to Sonya. She was at home.","Svidrigaylov provided drinks for her, for the organ grinder, the singers, and two clerks. He associated with these clerks precisely because they both had crooked noses: one’s nose turned sharply to the right, while the other’s turned to the left. This circumstance struck Svidrigaylov as significant. They finally lured him into some sort of pleasure garden, where he paid for their drinks and their entrance fees. One thin three-year-old fir tree and three bushes stood in this garden. In addition, a “Vauxhall”* had been built, in reality a tavern, but there one could also order tea; moreover, there were several green tables and chairs. A chorus of some poor singers and some drunken Munich German clown with a red nose, who was extremely morose, entertained the public. The two clerks quarreled with some other clerks and almost came to blows. Svidrigaylov was chosen by them to be the judge. He tried to resolve the dispute for a quarter of an hour, but they were shouting so loudly that there was no possibility of understanding anything. The most likely explanation was that one of them had stolen something and had even managed to sell it to some Yid who’d happened to turn up; but, having sold it, he didn’t want to share the proceeds with his fellow clerks. It turned out, at last, that the item he’d sold was a teaspoon belonging to the Vauxhall. The item was missed in the Vauxhall, and the affair began to take on a troublesome aspect. Svidrigaylov paid for the spoon, stood up, and left the garden. It was around ten o’clock. He himself had not had even one drop to drink all this time and had merely ordered tea in the Vauxhall, and that he’d done more for the sake of appearances. Meanwhile, the evening was stuffy and gloomy. By ten o’clock heavy clouds had amassed on all sides; there was thunder, and rain pelted down like a waterfall. Water cascaded onto the ground not in drops, but in entire streams. Lightning flashed continually; once he could count to five while the flashes lasted. Drenched to the skin, Svidrigaylov made his way back home, where he locked the door, opened his bureau, took out all of his cash, and tore up several papers. Then, after stashing the money in his pocket, he wanted to change his clothes, but, glancing at the window and hearing the storm and the rain, he waved his arm dismissively, took his hat, and left, without locking his apartment. He went right to Sonya’s room. She was at home.","Svidrigailov bought drinks for Katia, and the organ grinder, and the singers, and the servants, and a couple of little clerks. He had actually taken up with the two little clerks because they each had a crooked nose: one of them had a nose bent over to the right, and the other one to the left. Svidrigailov had been struck by that. They eventually persuaded him to accompany them to a pleasure garden, where he paid their entrance tickets and treated them. The garden contained a single lanky three-year-old fir tree and three little shrubs. There was also a ‘Vauxhall’,* in other words a bar, where you could get tea as well; and a number of little green tables and chairs. The public was being entertained by a chorus of bad singers and a German from Munich who was got up as a red-nosed clown, and for some reason was particularly mournful. The little clerks had a quarrel with some other little clerks, and almost got into a fight with them. They appointed Svidrigailov to judge between them. He’d been hearing their case for a whole quarter of an hour, but they were shouting so much that there wasn’t the faintest hope of making anything out. Most likely one of them had stolen something and actually managed to sell it to some Jew who happened by; but having sold it, he hadn’t wanted to go halves with his friend. Eventually it turned out that the stolen item was a teaspoon belonging to the Vauxhall. It had already been missed there, and things were turning awkward. Svidrigailov paid for the spoon, got up, and left the garden. It was about ten o’clock. He hadn’t drunk a drop of wine all evening; he had just ordered some tea at the Vauxhall, and that more for the sake of appearances. The evening was sultry and dark. By ten o’clock, great clouds had rolled in from everywhere; now there was a rumble of thunder and the rain cascaded down, splashing onto the ground not in drops but whole torrents. The lightning flashed incessantly, each flash lasting a count of five. He reached his home soaked to the skin, locked the door, opened his bureau, took out all his money, and tore up two or three papers. Then he shoved the money into his pocket and was about to change his clothes; but looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and rain, he gave up the idea, took his hat, and went out without locking the flat. He went straight to Sonia’s. She was at home. She wasn’t alone.","Svidrigailov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and the waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the left and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure garden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky three-year-old pine tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a “Vauxhall,”72 which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it. A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken, but extremely depressed German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent. Svidrigailov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no possibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his companion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon belonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem troublesome. Svidrigailov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of the garden. It was about six o’clock. He had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything. It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over the sky at about ten o’clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain came down like a waterfall. The water did not fall in drops, but beat on the earth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could count five. Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then, putting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes, but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home."

"Вечер был свежий, теплый и ясный; погода разгулялась еще с утра. Раскольников шел в свою квартиру; он спешил. Ему хотелось кончить все до заката солнца. До тех же пор не хотелось бы с кем-нибудь повстречаться. Поднимаясь в свою квартиру, он заметил, что Настасья, оторвавшись от самовара, пристально следит за ним и провожает его глазами. «Уж нет ли кого у меня?» – подумал он. Ему с отвращением померещился Порфирий. Но, дойдя до своей комнаты и отворив ее, он увидел Дунечку. Она сидела одна-одинешенька, в глубоком раздумье и, кажется, давно уже ждала его. Он остановился на пороге. Она привстала с дивана в испуге и выпрямилась пред ним. Ее взгляд, неподвижно устремленный на него, изображал ужас и неутолимую скорбь. И по одному этому взгляду он уже понял сразу, что ей все известно.","The evening was fresh, warm and clear; the weather cleared up in the morning.

"– Ты, брат, кажется, надо мной подсмеиваешься? – обратился он к нему с ловко выделанным раздражением. – Я согласен, что, может быть, уже слишком забочусь об этакой дряни, на твои глаза; но нельзя же считать меня за это ни эгоистом, ни жадным, и на мои глаза эти две ничтожные вещицы могут быть вовсе не дрянь.

"Он скорее допускал тут одну только тупую тягость инстинкта, которую не ему было порвать и через которую он опять-таки был не в силах перешагнуть (за слабостию и ничтожностию). Он смотрел на каторжных товарищей своих и удивлялся: как тоже все они любили жизнь, как они дорожили ею! Именно, ему показалось, что в остроге ее еще более любят и ценят и более дорожат ею, чем на свободе. Каких страшных мук и истязаний не перенесли иные из них, например, бродяги! Неужели уж столько может для них значить один какой-нибудь луч солнца, дремучий лес, где-нибудь в неведомой глуши холодный ключ, отмеченный еще с третьего года, и о свидании с которым бродяга мечтает как о свидании с любовницей, видит его во сне, зеленую травку кругом его, поющую птичку в кусте? Всматриваясь дальше, он видел примеры, еще более необъяснимые.","Rather, he allowed here only the dull burden of instinct, which he could not break and through which he again was not able to step over (because of weakness and insignificance). He looked at his convict comrades and was surprised: how they all loved life too, how they cherished it! Indeed, it seemed to him that in prison she was even more loved and appreciated and valued more than in freedom. What terrible torments and tortures did not endure some of them, for example, vagabonds! Can it really mean so much to them one ray of the sun, a dense forest, somewhere in an unknown wilderness a cold spring, marked since the third year, and about a date with which the tramp dreams of a meeting with his mistress, sees him in a dream, green grass all around him, a singing bird in the bush? Looking further, he saw examples even more inexplicable.","He would sooner admit to only the heavy burden of instinct, which he was unable to breach and which he once more lacked the strength to surmount (due to his weakness and insignificance). He observed his fellow convicts and was surprised: how they all, too, loved life, and how they valued it! It even seemed to him that in prison they loved, valued, and cherished it even more than when they had been free. What terrible suffering and torments some of them had endured, the tramps, for example! Was it really true that a ray of sunlight could mean so much to them, a thick forest, a cold spring somewhere in the remote backwoods, observed some years before; the tramp dreamt of a rendezvous with the spring as if it were a meeting with a beloved; he beheld it in his dreams, surrounded by green grass, a bird singing in the bushes. When Raskolnikov looked around, he saw even more inexplicable examples.","He was more inclined to accept that this was no more than the force of instinct, which he could never break, and which he was unable to overstep (because he was too weak and insignificant). He looked at his fellow convicts and wondered at them: how much they all loved life, how dearly they treasured it! Indeed, it seemed to him that people loved, valued, and treasured their lives here in prison even more than where they were free. What horrible pain and suffering some of them had endured—the vagrants,* for instance! How could a man find so much meaning in a single ray of sunlight, a deep forest, a cool spring somewhere in the trackless wilderness, which he had once seen two years ago and which he now yearned for as though it was a lovers’ tryst, dreaming about it and the green grass around it, with a bird singing in the bushes? As he went on thinking about this, he found examples that were even more inexplicable.","He preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he could not step over, again through weakness and meanness. He looked at his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and prized it. It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in prison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some of them, the tramps for instance, had endured! Could they care so much for a ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away in some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and longed to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush? As he went on he saw even more inexplicable examples."

"Судопроизводство по делу его прошло без больших затруднений. Преступник твердо, точно и ясно поддерживал свое показание, не запутывая обстоятельств, не смягчая их в свою пользу, не искажая фактов, не забывая малейшей подробности. Он рассказал до последней черты весь процесс убийства: разъяснил тайну заклада (деревянной дощечки с металлическою полоской), который оказался у убитой старухи в руках; рассказал подробно о том, как взял у убитой ключи, описал эти ключи, описал укладку и чем она была наполнена; даже исчислил некоторые из отдельных предметов, лежавших в ней; разъяснил загадку об убийстве Лизаветы; рассказал о том, как приходил и стучался Кох, а за ним студент, передав все, что они между собой говорили; как он, преступник, сбежал потом с лестницы и слышал визг Миколки и Митьки; как он спрятался в пустой квартире, пришел домой, и в заключение указал камень во дворе, на Вознесенском проспекте, под воротами, под которым найдены были вещи и кошелек. Одним словом, дело вышло ясное. Следователи и судьи очень удивлялись, между прочим, тому, что он спрятал кошелек и вещи под камень, не воспользовавшись ими, а пуще всего тому, что он не только не помнил в подробности всех вещей, собственно им похищенных, но даже в числе их ошибся. То, собственно, обстоятельство, что он ни разу не открыл кошелька и не знал даже, сколько именно в нем лежит денег, показалось невероятным (в кошельке оказалось триста семнадцать рублей серебром и три двугривенных; от долгого лежанья под камнем некоторые верхние, самые крупные, бумажки чрезвычайно попортились). Долго добивались разузнать: почему именно подсудимый в одном этом обстоятельстве лжет, тогда как во всем другом сознается добровольно и правдиво? Наконец, некоторые (особенно из психологов) допустили даже возможность того, что и действительно он не заглядывал в кошелек, а потому и не знал, что в нем было, и, не зная, так и снес под камень, но тут же из этого и заключали, что самое преступление не могло иначе и случиться, как при некотором временном умопомешательстве, так сказать, при болезненной мономании убийства и грабежа, без дальнейших целей и расчетов на выгоду. Тут кстати подоспела новейшая модная теория временного умопомешательства, которую так часто стараются применять в наше время к иным преступникам. К тому же давнишнее ипохондрическое состояние Раскольникова было заявлено до точности многими свидетелями, доктором Зосимовым, прежними его товарищами, хозяйкой, прислугой. Все это сильно способствовало заключению, что Раскольников не совсем похож на обыкновенного убийцу, разбойника и грабителя, но что тут что-то другое. К величайшей досаде защищавших это мнение, сам преступник почти не пробовал защищать себя; на окончательные вопросы: что именно могло склонить его к смертоубийству и что побудило его совершить грабеж, он отвечал весьма ясно, с самою грубою точностью, что причиной всему было его скверное положение, его нищета и беспомощность, желание упрочить первые шаги своей жизненной карьеры с помощью по крайней мере трех тысяч рублей, которые он рассчитывал найти у убитой. Решился же он на убийство вследствие своего легкомысленного и малодушного характера, раздраженного сверх того лишениями и неудачами. На вопросы же, что именно побудило его явиться с повинною, прямо отвечал, что чистосердечное раскаяние. Все это было почти уже грубо….","The proceedings in his case proceeded without great difficulty. The offender firmly, accurately and clearly supported his testimony, without confusing the circumstances, without softening them in his favor, without distorting the facts, without forgetting the slightest detail. He told the whole process of the murder to the last line: he explained the secret of the pawn (a wooden plank with a metal strip), which turned out to be in the hands of the murdered old woman; he spoke in detail about how he took the keys from the murdered woman, described these keys, described the packing and what it was filled with; even numbered some of the individual objects that lay in it; explained the riddle about the murder of Lizaveta; he told how Koch came and knocked, followed by a student, passing on everything that they had said among themselves; how he, the criminal, then ran down the stairs and heard the shrieks of Mikolka and Mitka; how he hid in an empty apartment, came home, and finally pointed out a stone in the courtyard, on Voznesensky Prospekt, under the gate, under which things and a purse were found. In a word, the matter turned out clear. The investigators and judges were very surprised, among other things, that he hid the purse and things under a stone without using them, and most of all, that he not only did not remember the details of all the things he actually stole, but even made a mistake among them. . The fact that he never once opened his purse and did not even know exactly how much money was in it seemed incredible (the purse contained three hundred and seventeen silver rubles and three kopecks; from lying under a stone for a long time, some of the top, largest, the papers are extremely damaged). For a long time they sought to find out: why exactly does the defendant lie in this one circumstance, while in everything else he confesses voluntarily and truthfully? Finally, some (especially from psychologists) even admitted the possibility that he really did not look into the wallet, and therefore did not know what was in it, and, not knowing, he took it under a stone, but immediately from this and they concluded that the crime itself could not have happened otherwise than with some temporary insanity, so to speak, with a painful monomania of murder and robbery, without further goals and calculations for profit. Here, by the way, the newest fashionable theory of temporary insanity arrived, which so often they try to apply in our time to other criminals. In addition, Raskolnikov's long-standing hypochondriacal state was stated to the point by many witnesses, Dr. Zosimov, his former comrades, mistress, and servants. All this greatly contributed to the conclusion that Raskolnikov is not exactly like an ordinary murderer, robber and robber, but that there is something else. To the great annoyance of those who defended this opinion, the criminal himself hardly tried to defend himself; to the final questions: what exactly could incline him to murder and what prompted him to commit robbery, he answered very clearly, with the most rude accuracy, that the reason for everything was his bad position, his poverty and helplessness, the desire to strengthen the first steps of his life career with the help of at least three thousand rubles, which he expected to find from the murdered woman. He decided to kill because of his frivolous and cowardly nature, irritated, moreover, by hardships and failures. When asked what exactly prompted him to turn himself in, he directly answered that sincere repentance. All this was almost already rude….","The legal proceedings had been conducted without any great difficulties. The criminal firmly, precisely, and clearly reaffirmed his testimony, without confusing the circumstances, not mitigating them in his own interest, not distorting the facts, and not forgetting the slightest details. He described to the last detail the whole process of the murder: he explained the mystery of the pledge (the piece of wood with the metal strip), which had turned up in the dead woman’s hands; he narrated in detail how he took the dead woman’s keys; he described these keys, described the chest and its contents; he even enumerated several of the objects contained within it; he explained the riddle of Lizaveta’s murder; he described how Kokh had arrived and knocked at the door, followed by the student, and conveyed everything said between them; then how he, the murderer, ran down the stairs afterward, heard the shrieks of Mikolka and Mitka; how he hid in the empty apartment, then arrived back home; and, in conclusion, he showed them the stone in the courtyard on Voznesensky Prospect, under the gates, where they found the pawnbroker’s things and her purse. In a word, the whole affair became clear. As this unfolded, the investigators and the judges were very surprised that he had hidden the purse and the items beneath a stone and made no use of them and, most of all, that not only did he fail to recall in detail all the items he had stolen, but he was even mistaken about their number. That circumstance in particular, that he had never even opened the purse and didn’t have any idea how much money was contained within it, seemed improbable. (There turned out to be three hundred and seventeen silver rubles and three twenty-kopeck pieces; because they had been under a stone for a long time, some of the largest banknotes at the top of the pile had deteriorated significantly.) They spent a long time trying to determine why the accused was lying about this one circumstance, when he was confessing about everything else so willingly and accurately. At last several of them (especially the psychologists) even allowed for the possibility that perhaps he had not looked into the purse and, therefore, hadn’t known what was in it and, not knowing, had placed it under the stone; but from this they concluded that the crime itself must have occurred during a period of temporary derangement of his mind, so to speak, accompanied by a morbid monomania of murder and robbery, without further aims or calculations of advantage. Here, as it happened, came into play the latest theory about temporary insanity, which people nowadays so often try to apply to various crimes. In addition, Raskolnikov’s long-standing hypochondria was precisely affirmed by many witnesses, including Dr. Zosimov, his former university colleagues, his landlady, and her servant. All of these factors strongly furthered the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not completely like an ordinary murderer, a robber, or a thief but something altogether different. To the great annoyance of those defending this opinion, the criminal hardly attempted to defend himself. In reply to the crucial questions “What could it have been that induced him to homicide?” and “What prompted him to commit robbery?” he said with utmost clarity, with the most offensive precision, that the reason for all of it was his miserable condition, his poverty and helplessness, his desire to provide for the first steps in his life’s work with the help, at least, of the three thousand rubles he had counted on finding at the old woman’s apartment. He’d decided on murder as a result of his thoughtless and fainthearted character, further irritated by deprivation and failures. In reply to the question of what had caused him to offer a confession, he answered frankly that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was said almost offensively . . .","His trial had passed off without any particular difficulties. The criminal had maintained his confession firmly, precisely, and clearly, without confusing any of the circumstances nor softening them in his favour; he neither misrepresented the facts, nor forgot the smallest particular. He described in the fullest detail exactly how the murder had been done; he explained the mystery of his pledge (the little wooden board with the metal strip) which had been found in the dead woman’s hands; he gave a detailed account of taking the keys from his victim, describing the keys and the trunk and its contents; he even named some of the items in it. He cleared up the puzzle of Lizaveta’s murder, and described how Koch had come and knocked at the door, and the student after him; he reported everything they had said to one another; then he described how he, the criminal, had run downstairs and heard the yells from Mikolka and Mitka; and how he had hidden in the empty apartment, and then gone home; and he ended by pointing out the stone in the gateway of the courtyard off Voznesensky Prospekt, under which the purse and the other things were found. In short, everything turned out to be quite clear. The investigators and judges were very surprised, incidentally, that he’d hidden the purse and other items under the stone, without making any use of them; and most surprised of all that he not only didn’t remember the details of all the objects he had actually stolen, but had actually got the number of them wrong. It seemed incredible that he’d never once opened the purse, and didn’t even know just how much money it contained (it turned out to be three hundred and seventeen silver roubles and three twenty-kopek pieces; some of the biggest notes at the top of the pile had almost rotted away from lying so long under the stone). The investigators spent a long time trying to discover why the accused was lying about this single question, while voluntarily and truthfully confessing everything else. Eventually some of them (particularly the psychologists) actually conceded that he might really have never looked inside the purse, and consequently hadn’t known what was in it, and had buried it under the stone without finding out; but they concluded from this that the crime couldn’t have been committed other than in a state of temporary insanity, driven by a morbid fixation on murder and robbery with no ulterior motive or hope of gain. This fitted in neatly with the latest modish theories of temporary insanity,* which people tend to try to apply to criminals nowadays. Moreover, a number of witnesses testified in detail to the state of hypochondria that Raskolnikov had been suffering for some time; they included Dr Zosimov, Raskolnikov’s former companions, his landlady, and the servant. All this strongly reinforced the conclusion that Raskolnikov wasn’t quite like an ordinary murderer, robber, and thief; that there was something different about this case. To the great annoyance of the proponents of this view, the prisoner himself made almost no attempt to excuse himself; when he was asked outright what exactly had motivated him to commit murder and to rob, he answered quite clearly and with the most brutal frankness that it had all resulted from his wretched situation, his helplessness and poverty, and his hope of furthering the first steps in his career with the help of the three thousand roubles at least that he had counted on getting from his victim. He had been driven to commit the murder by his shallow and cowardly nature, further exacerbated by privation and failure. And when he was asked what had induced him to go and confess, he answered straight out that it was sincere repentance. All of this was said almost rudely…","There had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered exactly, firmly and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse or misrepresent the facts, or soften them in his own interest, or omit the smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder, the secret of the pledge (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which was found in the murdered woman’s hand. He described minutely how he had taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its contents; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta’s murder; described how Koch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said to one another; how afterwards he had run downstairs and heard Nikolai and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty apartment and afterwards gone home. He finished by indicating the stone in the yard off the Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found. The whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the judges were very much struck, amongst other things, by the fact that he had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making use of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the trinkets were like, or even how many there were. The fact that he had never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed incredible. It turned out to hold three hundred and seventeen rubles and sixty kopecks. Because it had been lying under the stone for so long, some of the most valuable notes had suffered from the damp. They spent a long while trying to discover why the accused man should tell a lie about this when he had made a truthful and straight forward confession about everything else. Finally some of the lawyers more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really not looked into the purse and so didn’t know what was in it when he hid it under the stone. But they immediately deduced that the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental derangement, through homicidal mania, without any purpose or pursuit of gain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary insanity, so often applied nowadays in criminal cases. Moreover Raskolnikov’s hypochondriac condition was proved by many witnesses, by Dr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant. All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another element in the case. To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand rubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder through his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by poverty and failure. To the question what led him to confess, he answered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost coarse . . ."

Не примет Авдотья Романовна, так я, пожалуй, еще глупее их употреблю. Это раз. Второе: совесть моя совершенно покойна; я без всяких расчетов предлагаю. Верьте не верьте, а впоследствии узнаете и вы и Авдотья Романовна. Все в том, что я действительно принес несколько хлопот и неприятностей многоуважаемой вашей сестрице; стало быть, чувствуя искреннее раскаяние, сердечно желаю, – не откупиться, не заплатить за неприятности, а просто-запросто сделать для нее что-нибудь выгодное, на том основании, что не привилегию же в самом деле взял я делать одно только злое. Если бы в моем предложении была хотя миллионная доля расчета, то не стал бы я предлагать всего только десять тысяч, тогда как всего пять недель назад предлагал ей больше. Кроме того, я, может быть, весьма и весьма скоро женюсь на одной девице, а следственно, все подозрения в каких-нибудь покушениях против Авдотьи Романовны тем самым должны уничтожиться.

Believe it or not, and later you and Avdotya Romanovna will find out. The thing is that I really brought a few troubles and troubles to your esteemed sister; therefore, feeling sincere repentance, I sincerely wish - not to pay off, not to pay for the troubles, but simply to do something beneficial for her, on the grounds that I really did not take the privilege to do only evil. If my offer had even included a millionth part of the calculation, then I would not have offered only ten thousand, while only five weeks ago I offered her more. In addition, I may very, very soon marry one girl, and, consequently, all suspicions of some kind of attempt against Avdotya Romanovna should thereby be destroyed.

Secondly: my conscience is completely clear; I have no ulterior motives in making this offer. Believe it or not, but later both you and Avdotya Romanovna will find that out. The thing is that I really did cause significant trouble and unpleasantness to your sister, whom I greatly respect; therefore, feeling genuine remorse, I sincerely desire—not to redeem myself financially or pay her for the unpleasantness, but simply to do something advantageous for her, on the grounds that I have not reserved the right for myself to perform only evil acts. If in my proposal there was even a one-millionth part of calculation, I wouldn’t have made it so openly; and I wouldn’t be offering her only ten thousand, when only five weeks ago I was offering her more. Besides, very, very soon I may be marrying a young woman, and consequently, that fact alone should eliminate any suspicion that I still have designs on Avdotya Romanovna. In conclusion, I will say that in marrying Mr. Luzhin, Avdotya Romanovna will be accepting the same money, only from a different source. . . . Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovich; consider this calmly and coolly.”","But firstly, though I’m not rich, those ten thousand roubles are free for me to dispose of, I mean to say that I don’t need them at all.

Secondly: my conscience is absolutely clear; I’m offering the money without any ulterior motive. You can believe me or not, but in time both you and Avdotya Romanovna will see it’s true. The whole point is that I really did cause your respected sister a certain amount of trouble and distress, and now I truly repent and wish with all my heart—not to buy myself off, nor to pay for the unpleasantness, but simply to do her some good, for after all I don’t claim the privilege of doing nothing but harm. If there was a millionth part of calculation in my offer, I shouldn’t be making it so openly; nor should I be offering her just ten thousand roubles, when only five weeks ago I was offering her more.

Secondly, my conscience is perfectly at ease; I am not making the offer with any ulterior motive. You may not believe it, but in the end Avdotia Romanovna and you will know. The point is that I did actually cause your sister, whom I greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely regretting it, I want—not to compensate, not to repay her for the unpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to show that I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm. If there were a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not have made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousand only, when five weeks ago I offered her more. Besides, I may, perhaps, very soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion of any design on Avdotia Romanovna.

"Андрей Семенович сидел почему-то все это утро дома. С этим господином у Петра Петровича установились какие-то странные, впрочем, отчасти и естественные отношения: Петр Петрович презирал и ненавидел его даже сверх меры, почти с того самого дня, как у него поселился, но в то же время как будто несколько опасался его. Он остановился у него по приезде в Петербург не из одной только скаредной экономии, хотя это и было почти главною причиной, но была тут и другая причина. Еще в провинции слышал он об Андрее Семеновиче, своем бывшем питомце, как об одном из самых передовых молодых прогрессистов и даже как об играющем значительную роль в иных любопытных и баснословных кружках. Это поразило Петра Петровича. Вот эти-то мощные, всезнающие, всех презирающие и всех обличающие кружки уже давно пугали Петра Петровича каким-то особенным страхом, совершенно, впрочем, неопределенным. Уж, конечно, сам он, да еще в провинции, не мог ни о чем в этом роде составить себе, хотя приблизительно, точное понятие. Слышал он, как и все, что существуют, особенно в Петербурге, какие-то прогрессисты, нигилисты, обличители и проч. и проч., но, подобно многим, преувеличивал и искажал смысл и значение этих названий до нелепого. Пуще всего боялся он, вот уже несколько лет, обличения, и это было главнейшим основанием его постоянного, преувеличенного беспокойства, особенно при мечтах о перенесении деятельности своей в Петербург. В этом отношении он был, как говорится, испуган, как бывают иногда испуганы маленькие дети. Несколько лет тому назад в провинции, еще начиная только устраивать свою карьеру, он встретил два случая жестоко обличенных губернских довольно значительных лиц, за которых он дотоле цеплялся и которые ему покровительствовали. Один случай кончился для обличенного лица как-то особенно скандально, а другой чуть-чуть было не кончился даже и весьма хлопотливо. Вот почему Петр Петрович положил, по приезде в Петербург, немедленно разузнать, в чем дело, и если надо, то на всякий случай забежать вперед и заискать у «молодых поколений наших». В этом случае надеялся он на Андрея Семеновича и при посещении, например, Раскольникова уже научился кое-как округлять известные фразы с чужого голоса…","Andrey Semyonovich, for some reason, had been sitting at home all that morning. With this gentleman, Pyotr Petrovich established some strange, however, partly natural relations: Pyotr Petrovich despised and hated him even beyond measure, almost from the very day he settled with him, but at the same time seemed to be somewhat afraid of him. . He stayed with him on his arrival in Petersburg not only out of stingy savings, although this was almost the main reason, but there was another reason as well. While still in the provinces, he heard of Andrei Semyonovich, his former pupil, as one of the most advanced young progressives and even as playing a significant role in other curious and fabulous circles. This struck Pyotr Petrovich. These powerful, all-knowing circles that despise everyone and denounce everyone have long frightened Pyotr Petrovich with some kind of special fear, which, however, is completely indefinite. Of course, he himself, and even in the provinces, could not form for himself, although approximately, an exact concept of anything of this kind. He heard, like everything that exists, especially in St. Petersburg, some kind of progressives, nihilists, accusers, and so on. and so on, but, like many, he exaggerated and distorted the meaning and significance of these names to the point of absurdity. Most of all, for several years now, he was afraid of exposure, and this was the main reason for his constant, exaggerated anxiety, especially when dreaming of transferring his activities to Petersburg. In this respect he was, as they say, frightened, as small children are sometimes frightened. A few years ago in the provinces, while still just beginning to arrange his career, he met two cases of severely exposed provincial rather significant persons, whom he had hitherto clung to and who patronized him. One case ended somehow especially scandalously for the exposed person, and the other almost ended very troublesomely. That is why Pyotr Petrovich decided, upon arrival in Petersburg, to immediately find out what was the matter, and if necessary, just in case, run ahead and seek out from ""our young generations."" In this case, he hoped for Andrei Semenovich, and when visiting, for example, Raskolnikov, he already learned how to somehow round off well-known phrases from someone else's voice ...","For some reason, Andrey Semyonych had remained at home all that morning. Petr Petrovich’s relationship with this gentleman was rather strange, though also natural: Petr Petrovich despised and hated him beyond all measure, almost from the very first day when he had moved in, but at the same time he seemed to be somewhat afraid of him. Upon his arrival in Petersburg he had stayed with him not merely for reasons of tightfisted economy, although that was really the main reason, but also for another reason. While still in the provinces he had heard about Andrey Semyonych, his former ward, regarded as one of the most advanced young progressives, and even about the significant role he played in various intriguing and legendary circles. This surprised Petr Petrovich. These powerful, all-knowing circles, which despised and attacked everyone, had for a long time inspired Petr Petrovich with a particular kind of fear, one that was, however, completely undefined. Of course, he himself, while still in the provinces, couldn’t possibly come to a precise understanding, even an approximate one, of something of this kind. Like everyone else, he heard that especially in Petersburg, there existed some progressives, nihilists, denouncers, and so on and so forth, but like many others, he exaggerated and distorted the meaning and importance of these names to the point of absurdity. Most of all, he was afraid, and had been for several years, of denunciation, and that was the principal basis of his constant, exaggerated uneasiness, especially when he considered his dreams of transferring his activity to Petersburg. In this regard he was scared, as they say, the way little children are often scared. Several years ago in the provinces, while still only beginning his career, he’d encountered two instances of cruel denunciation of rather important local personages to whom he had up to then attached himself and who served as his patrons. One instance ended for the exposed personage in a particularly scandalous way, and the other almost ended in an extremely troublesome manner. That was why on his arrival in Petersburg, Petr Petrovich decided to investigate as soon as possible what all this was about and, if necessary, to anticipate matters and ingratiate himself with “our younger generation.” In this instance he was relying on Andrey Semyonych; during his visit with Raskolnikov, Petr Petrovich had somehow learned to repeat well-worn phrases blindly . . .","Andrei Semionovich had for some reason spent all that morning at home. The relations that Piotr Petrovich had established with this gentleman were rather strange, though natural in a way: he despised and hated him beyond measure, and had done from the day he arrived, yet at the same time he seemed rather afraid of him. He had come to lodge with him as soon as he arrived in Petersburg, not entirely out of miserly economy, though that had perhaps been his chief consideration. There was another reason too. Even back in the provinces he had heard that Andrei Semionovich, a former protégé of his, was now one of the foremost young progressives, and actually played a significant part in certain curious and legendary circles. That had greatly impressed Piotr Petrovich. These powerful, omniscient groups, who despised and denounced everyone else, had long filled Piotr Petrovich with a kind of ill-defined but profound fear. He himself could not of course have gained the least understanding, not even a rough idea, of that sort of thing—particularly while still in the provinces. Like everyone else, he had heard that there existed, especially in Petersburg, people called progressives, or nihilists, or denouncers,* or whatever; but like many others he had exaggerated and twisted the meaning and significance of those terms to an absurd degree. His worst fear, for some years now, had been of denunciation; and that was the chief cause of his constant, exaggerated uneasiness, especially when considering moving to work in Petersburg. He was scared in that way, as small children are sometimes scared. Several years back, when he was in the provinces and just embarking on his career, he had known of two quite highly placed people in his province, people to whom he had attached himself and who had patronized him, who had then been viciously denounced. One case had ended in a highly scandalous way for the man in question, while the other had almost led to serious trouble. And so Piotr Petrovich had resolved that as soon as he got to Petersburg, he’d immediately discover what was going on, and if necessary get ahead of the game by currying favour with ‘our younger generations’. He was relying on Andrei Semionovich here, and had already learned, after a fashion, to mouth a few useful phrases he’d picked up, in case he found himself meeting people like, for example, Raskolnikov.","Andrei Semionovich had been at home all morning. Peter Petrovich’s attitude to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural. Peter Petrovich had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg solely due to his own tightfistedness, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard that Andrei Semionovich, who had once been his protégé, was a leading young progressive who was playing an important part in certain interesting circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had impressed Peter Petrovich. These powerful, omniscient circles, which despised everyone and showed everyone up for what they really were, had long been for him a peculiar but wholly vague cause for concern. He had not, of course, been able to form even an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for many years past he had feared more than anything was being shown up for what he really was and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the thought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of this in the same way as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years previously, when he was just embarking on his own career, he had come upon two cases in which rather important people in the province, patrons of his, had been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious trouble. For this reason Peter Petrovich intended to go into the subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to anticipate contingencies by seeking the favor of “our younger generation.” He relied on Andrei Semionovich for this and before his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current phrases."

"И если бы даже случилось когда-нибудь так, что уже все до последней точки было бы им разобрано и решено окончательно и сомнений не оставалось бы уже более никаких, – то тут-то бы, кажется, он и отказался от всего, как от нелепости, чудовищности и невозможности. Но неразрешенных пунктов и сомнений оставалась еще целая бездна. Что же касается до того, где достать топор, то эта мелочь его нисколько не беспокоила, потому что не было ничего легче. Дело в том, что Настасьи, и особенно по вечерам, поминутно не бывало дома: или убежит к соседям, или в лавочку, а дверь всегда оставляет настежь. Хозяйка только из-за этого с ней и ссорилась. Итак, стоило только потихоньку войти, когда придет время, в кухню и взять топор, а потом, чрез час (когда все уже кончится), войти и положить обратно. Но представлялись и сомнения: он, положим, придет через час, чтобы положить обратно, а Настасья тут как тут, воротилась. Конечно, надо пройти мимо и выждать, пока она опять выйдет. А ну как тем временем хватится топора, искать начнет, раскричится, – вот и подозрение, или, по крайней мере, случай к подозрению.","And even if it had ever happened so that everything up to the last point would have been sorted out and decided definitively by him, and there would have been no more doubts left, then it would seem that he would have renounced everything as if it were absurdity. , monstrosity and impossibility. But there was still a whole abyss of unresolved points and doubts. As for where to get the ax, this trifle did not bother him at all, because nothing was easier. The fact is that Nastasya, and especially in the evenings, was not at home every minute: she would either run away to the neighbors, or to the shop, and the door always leaves wide open. The hostess only quarreled with her because of this. So, one had only to quietly enter, when the time came, into the kitchen and take an ax, and then, an hour later (when everything was over), enter and put it back. But doubts were also presented: he, let's say, would come in an hour to put him back, and Nastasya was right there, returned. Of course, you have to walk by and wait until she comes out again. But how, in the meantime, he misses the ax, starts looking, screams - that's suspicion, or at least a case for suspicion.","And even if it sometimes happened that everything was understood and definitively resolved and that no further doubts remained—in that case, it seems, he would have renounced all of it as an absurdity, a monstrosity, and an impossibility. An enormous number of unresolved points and doubts still remained. As for where he could acquire an axe, that detail didn’t faze him in the least, since there was nothing easier. Especially in the evenings, Nastasya was frequently away from the house: either she ran off to the neighbors or to a shop, and the door was always left wide open. The landlady quarreled with her only about this oversight. And so, when the time came, all one had to do was enter the kitchen on the sly and grab the axe, then later, an hour later (when everything was finished), go in and put it back. But doubts still remained: let’s suppose he returned an hour later to put it back, but Nastasya was also there. Of course, he’d have to pass by and wait until she left again. What if during that time the axe was needed, she began looking for it, and started yelling— that would arouse suspicion or, at least, grounds for suspicion.","And even if everything had been finally planned and decided, down to the very last detail, with no doubts whatsoever remaining—even then, he would probably have given up the whole idea as too absurd, too monstrous and impossible. But there were still countless unsolved problems and doubts. As for the question of where to get hold of an axe—that was a trivial detail that didn’t worry him in the slightest, because nothing could have been easier. The fact was that Nastasia was always leaving the house, especially in the evenings. Either she would drop in on the neighbours, or go out to the shop; and she always left the door open. That was the landlady’s only quarrel with her. So all he had to do was slip quietly into the kitchen when the time came, take the axe, and then, an hour later—when it was all over—go in and put it back. Naturally some problems remained. He might, for instance, return after an hour to replace the axe, and there would be Nastasia, back home again. In that case, of course, he’d have to walk past the door and wait for her to go out again. But supposing she noticed meanwhile that the axe was missing, and started hunting for it, and raised an outcry? That would arouse suspicion at once, or at least give grounds for it.","And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of any kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all as something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole heap of unsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe, that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier. Nastasia was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings; she would run in to the neighbors’ apartments or to a store, and always left the door ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her about. And so when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything was over) go in and put it back again. But there were doubtful points too. Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasia had come back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait till she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss the axe, start looking, make an outcry—that would mean suspicion or at least grounds for suspicion."
"Краска даже ударила в его бледное, изнуренное лицо.

"С замиранием сердца и нервною дрожью подошел он к преогромнейшему дому, выходившему одною стеной на канаву, а другою в-ю улицу. Этот дом стоял весь в мелких квартирах и заселен был всякими промышленниками – портными, слесарями, кухарками, разными немцами, девицами, живущими от себя, мелким чиновничеством и проч. Входящие и выходящие так и шмыгали под обоими воротами и на обоих дворах дома. Тут служили три или четыре дворника. Молодой человек был очень доволен, не встретив ни которого из них, и неприметно проскользнул сейчас же из ворот направо на лестницу. Лестница была темная и узкая, «черная», но он все уже это знал и изучил, и ему вся эта обстановка нравилась: в такой темноте даже и любопытный взгляд был неопасен. «Если о сю пору я так боюсь, что же было бы, если б и действительно как-нибудь случилось до самого дела дойти?..» – подумал он невольно, проходя в четвертый этаж. Здесь загородили ему дорогу отставные солдаты-носильщики, выносившие из одной квартиры мебель. Он уже прежде знал, что в этой квартире жил один семейный немец, чиновник: «Стало быть, этот немец теперь выезжает, и, стало быть, в четвертом этаже, по этой лестнице и на этой площадке, остается, на некоторое время, только одна старухина квартира занятая. Это хорошо… на всякий случай…» – подумал он опять и позвонил в старухину квартиру. Звонок брякнул слабо, как будто был сделан из жести, а не из меди. В подобных мелких квартирах таких домов почти всё такие звонки. Он уже забыл звон этого колокольчика, и теперь этот особенный звон как будто вдруг ему что-то напомнил и ясно представил… Он так и вздрогнул, слишком уж ослабели нервы на этот раз. Немного спустя дверь приотворилась на крошечную щелочку: жилица оглядывала из щели пришедшего с видимым недоверием, и только виднелись ее сверкавшие из темноты глазки. Но, увидав на площадке много народу, она ободрилась и отворила совсем. Молодой человек переступил через порог в темную прихожую, разгороженную перегородкой, за которою была крошечная кухня. Старуха стояла перед ним молча и вопросительно на него глядела. Это была крошечная сухая старушонка, лет шестидесяти, с вострыми и злыми глазками, с маленьким вострым носом и простоволосая. Белобрысые, мало поседевшие волосы ее были жирно смазаны маслом. На ее тонкой и длинной шее, похожей на куриную ногу, было наверчено какое-то фланелевое тряпье, а на плечах, несмотря на жару, болталась вся истрепанная и пожелтелая меховая кацавейка.[2] Старушонка поминутно кашляла и кряхтела. Должно быть, молодой человек взглянул на нее каким-нибудь особенным взглядом, потому что и в ее глазах мелькнула вдруг опять прежняя недоверчивость.","With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he approached the enormous house, one wall facing the ditch, and the other into the street. This house was all in small apartments and was inhabited by all sorts of industrialists - tailors, locksmiths, cooks, various Germans, girls living on their own, petty officials, and so on. Those who entered and went out darted under both gates and in both courtyards of the house. There were three or four janitors working here. The young man was very pleased not to meet any of them, and imperceptibly slipped out of the gate to the right onto the stairs. The staircase was dark and narrow, ""black"", but he already knew and studied all this, and he liked the whole situation: in such darkness, even a curious look was harmless. “If I’m so afraid now, what would have happened if it had really somehow happened to get to the point? ..” he thought involuntarily as he walked to the fourth floor. Here, retired porters, who were carrying furniture out of one apartment, blocked his way. He already knew before that one family German, an official, lived in this apartment: “So this German is now leaving, and therefore, on the fourth floor, along this staircase and on this site, there remains, for some time, only one old woman's apartment is busy. This is good ... just in case ... ""- he thought again and called the old woman's apartment. The bell rang out weakly, as if it were made of tin rather than copper. In such small apartments of such houses, almost all of these calls. He had already forgotten the ringing of this bell, and now this special ringing as if suddenly reminded him of something and clearly imagined ... He just shuddered, his nerves were too weak this time. A little later, the door opened a little to a tiny crack: the dweller looked out of the crack at the visitor with visible distrust, and only her eyes were visible, sparkling from the darkness. But, seeing a lot of people on the landing, she cheered up and opened completely. The young man stepped over the threshold into a dark hallway, partitioned off by a partition, behind which was a tiny kitchen. The old woman stood before him in silence and looked at him questioningly. She was a tiny dry old woman, about sixty years old, with keen and evil eyes, with a small, pointed nose and simple hair. Her blond, slightly gray hair was greased with oil. On her thin and long neck, like a chicken leg, there was some kind of flannel rags, and on her shoulders, in spite of the heat, all the frayed and yellowed fur katsaveika dangled. [2] The old woman was constantly coughing and groaning. The young man must have looked at her with some special look, because in her eyes the same mistrust suddenly flashed again.","With a sinking heart and nervous trembling, he approached an immense building, one wall of which opened onto a narrow canal, the other onto Sadovaya Street. This building consisted of small apartments inhabited by all sorts of tradesmen—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, various Germans, streetwalkers, low-ranking civil servants, and others. People entering and leaving the building kept darting under both gates and across both courtyards. Three or four doormen worked there. The young man was very pleased when he didn’t encounter any of them and managed to slip unnoticed right through the gates and directly onto the staircase. The staircase was dark and narrow, “a back entrance,” but he knew that already, having studied it, and he liked this whole setting: in such darkness even casting a curious glance wouldn’t be dangerous. “If I’m so afraid now, what would happen if I somehow managed to commit the actual deed?” he thought inadvertently as he climbed up to the fourth floor. Some ex-military porters blocked his way as they carried some furniture out of one apartment. He already knew that a German, a civil servant, had been living there with his family: “It must be that the German’s moving out now and, consequently, on the fourth floor, on this staircase, on this landing only the old woman’s apartment will be occupied for a certain time. That’s good . . . just in case,” he thought again and rang the old woman’s bell. The bell jingled feebly, as if it were made of tin and not copper. Such bells could be found in almost all similar small buildings. He’d already forgotten the ring of this bell, and now this particular sound suddenly seemed to remind him of something and summon it clearly into mind. . . . He even shuddered, since his nerves had been so frayed of late. A few moments later, the door opened a tiny crack: the inhabitant peered out at the caller with visible distrust, and all that could be seen in the darkness were her flashing beady eyes. But, seeing so many people on the landing, she felt emboldened and opened the door wide. The young man stepped across the threshold into a dark vestibule divided by a partition from a tiny kitchen. The old woman stood before him silently, regarding him inquisitively. She was a small, dried-up miserable old woman, about sixty years old, with piercing, malicious little eyes, a small sharp nose, and her bare head. Her light blond, slightly grayed hair was thickly smeared with grease. Around her long, thin neck, resembling a chicken leg, was draped some sort of flannel rag, and over her shoulders, in spite of the heat, a worn-out, faded fur-trimmed jacket hung loosely. The old woman kept coughing and wheezing. It must have been that the young man glanced at her with some special sort of look, because her former distrust suddenly flashed in her eyes again.","He approached the house with a sinking heart, trembling with nerves. It was an enormous building, one side facing onto the canal and another onto —— Street. * The whole building was divided into tiny apartments, inhabited by all sorts of small tradespeople—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans with various occupations, girls selling themselves, minor clerks and the like. People were hurrying in and out of its two gates and across the two courtyards. Three or four yardkeepers* were on duty here. The young man was very pleased not to meet any of them, and at once slipped unseen through the right-hand gate and up the stairs. It was a back stairway, dark and narrow, but he knew all about that, he had already sized it up, and the whole situation suited him. In darkness like this, even prying eyes were no threat. ‘If I’m this scared right now, what would it be like if I ever found myself actually doing the thing?’ That was his thought as he reached the fourth floor. Here he was obstructed by some retired soldiers acting as porters, carrying furniture out of one of the flats. He already knew that this flat was occupied by a German clerk and his family. ‘ That means that the German’s moving out; so for a while the only flat still occupied on the fourth floor, up these particular stairs and on this landing, will be the old woman’s. That’s good … just in case…’ he thought again, as he rang the bell of the old woman’s flat. The bell gave a feeble clink, as though it were made of tin instead of brass. In buildings like these, the flats almost always have that sort of bell. He had forgotten the sound of it, and now its particular clink suddenly reminded him very vividly of something. He shuddered—his nerves were far too shaken today. After a few moments the door opened a tiny crack. Through that crack, the occupant peered at her visitor with evident suspicion. Nothing could be seen but her little eyes glinting in the dark. But once she saw several people on the landing, she took courage and opened the door wider. The young man stepped over the threshold into a dark entrance-hall, with a partition hiding a tiny kitchen. The old woman faced him silently, with a questioning look. She was a tiny, dried-up little old crone of around sixty, with sharp, evil-looking eyes and a short pointed nose. She was bareheaded, and her tow-coloured hair with its few streaks of grey was thickly greased. Her long neck, scrawny as a chicken’s leg, was adorned with a piece of flannel rag, and despite the heat she wore a short fur jacket, tattered and yellowed with age, dangling off her shoulders. The little old woman kept coughing and grunting. The young man must have looked at her in some special way, because the suspicious look suddenly flashed in her eyes again.","With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the street. This house was let out in tiny apartments and was inhabited by working people of all kinds—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of all sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc. There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed in the building. The young man was very glad not to meet any of them, and at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the staircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings: in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be feared. “If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that I were really going to do it?” he could not help asking himself as he reached the fourth floor. There his progress was barred by some porters who were moving furniture out of an apartment. He knew that the apartment had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his family. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this staircase would be vacant except for the old woman. “That’s a good thing anyway,” he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old woman’s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of copper. The little apartments in such houses always have bells that ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it clearly before him . . . He gave a start, his nerves were terribly overstrained by now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness. But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entryway, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive, withered old woman of sixty, with sharp mean eyes and a sharp little nose. Her colorless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck, which looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag, and, in spite of the heat , there hung flapping on her shoulders a tattered fur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every instant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again."

"Прошло минут пять. Он все ходил взад и вперед, молча и не взглядывая на нее. Наконец, подошел к ней, глаза его сверкали. Он взял ее обеими руками за плечи и прямо посмотрел в ее плачущее лицо. Взгляд его был сухой, воспаленный, острый, губы его сильно вздрагивали… Вдруг он весь быстро наклонился и, припав к полу, поцеловал ее ногу. Соня в ужасе от него отшатнулась, как от сумасшедшего. И действительно, он смотрел, как совсем сумасшедший.","Five minutes passed. He kept pacing back and forth, silently and without looking at her. Finally, he approached her, his eyes sparkling.

He took her shoulders in both hands, and looked straight into her weeping face.

Sonia recoiled from him in horror, as though he were a madman. And he did look completely mad.","Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not looking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful face. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were twitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the ground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. He certainly looked like a madman."
"И как только он сказал это, опять одно прежнее, знакомое ощущение оледенило вдруг его душу: он смотрел на нее и вдруг в ее лице как бы увидел лицо Лизаветы. Он ярко запомнил выражение лица Лизаветы, когда он приближался к ней тогда с топором, а она отходила от него к стене, выставив вперед руку, с совершенно детским испугом в лице, точь-в-точь как маленькие дети, когда они вдруг начинают чего-нибудь пугаться, смотрят неподвижно и беспокойно на пугающий их предмет, отстраняются назад и, протягивая вперед ручонку, готовятся заплакать. Почти то же самое случилось теперь и с Соней; так же бессильно, с тем же испугом, смотрела она на него несколько времени и вдруг, выставив вперед левую руку, слегка, чуть-чуть, уперлась ему пальцами в грудь и медленно стала подниматься с кровати, все более и более от него отстраняясь, и все неподвижнее становился ее взгляд на него. Ужас ее вдруг сообщился и ему: точно такой же испуг показался и в его лице, точно так же и он стал смотреть на нее, и почти даже с тою же детскою улыбкой.","And as soon as he said this, again one former, familiar sensation suddenly froze his soul: he looked at her and suddenly in her face he seemed to see the face of Lizaveta. He clearly remembered the expression on Lizaveta's face when he approached her then with an ax, and she moved away from him to the wall, putting her hand forward, with a completely childish fright in her face, just like little children when they suddenly start something. to be frightened, they look motionless and uneasily at the object that frightens them, step back and, stretching their hand forward, prepare to cry. Almost the same thing happened now with Sonya; just as powerlessly, with the same fright, she looked at him for some time and suddenly, putting forward her left hand, lightly, slightly, rested her fingers on his chest and slowly began to rise from the bed, more and more moving away from him, and her gaze on him became more and more fixed. Her horror suddenly communicated itself to him: exactly the same fright appeared in his face, in exactly the same way he began to look at her, and almost even with the same childish smile.","As soon as he said this, once again a prior, familiar feeling all at once turned his soul to ice: he glanced at her and all of a sudden he seemed to see Lizaveta’s face in hers. He clearly recalled Lizaveta’s expression as he approached her with his axe and she retreated from him toward the wall, holding up her hand, childlike fear in her face. It was just like little children when they suddenly get frightened of something: they stare motionlessly and anxiously at what’s scaring them, they retreat and, stretching out their little hands, they get ready to burst into tears. Almost the same thing was happening now with Sonya: just as weakly, with the same fright, she looked at him for a while, and all of a sudden, stretching out her left hand, she gently pushed her fingers against his chest and slowly began standing up from the bed, moving farther and farther away from him, fixing her intense stare on him all the while. Her horror was suddenly communicated to him: it was as if the same fright showed in his face; he began staring at her the same way, almost even with the same childlike smile.","And as soon as he had spoken, an old, familiar feeling spread an icy chill through his soul. He was looking at her, and in her face he suddenly seemed to see the face of Lizaveta. He had a vivid memory of Lizaveta’s expression on that day, as he advanced towards her with the axe in his hand, and she backed away from him towards the wall, stretching out her arm in front of her, with a look of childish fear on her face, just exactly like little children when they are suddenly scared of something, and stare fixedly and anxiously at the terrifying object, and back away from it, stretching out their little hands, on the point of bursting into tears. Almost the same thing happened to Sonia now: she watched him just as helplessly, just as fearfully, for a time, and then suddenly stretched out her left arm, pressing her fingers ever so lightly against his chest, and slowly began to get up from the bed, edging further and further away from him, with her eyes ever more firmly fixed on his face. Her horror suddenly spread to him too, and his face took on the same frightened expression; he began looking at her in just the same way, with almost the same childish smile.","As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his heart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the face of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta’s face, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking like little children do when they begin to be frightened of something, looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and holding out their little hands on the verge of tears. Almost the same thing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed even more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear showed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost with the same childish smile."
"Он снял запор, отворил дверь и стал слушать на лестницу.","He removed the lock, opened the door and listened on the stairs.","He undid the bolt, opened the door, and listened on the staircase.","He unlocked the door and opened it, and stood listening down the stairs.","He unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the staircase."
– Хочу.,- Want.,"“I would,” Raskolnikov replied.","‘Yes, please.’",“Yes.”
"– Не знаю-с… Извините… – пробормотал господин, испуганный и вопросом, и странным видом Раскольникова, и перешел на другую сторону улицы.","“I don’t know, sir… Sorry…” muttered the gentleman, frightened both by the question and by Raskolnikov's strange look, and crossed to the other side of the street.","Excuse me,” muttered the gentleman, frightened by both Raskolnikov’s question and his strange look, and crossed to the other side of the street.","‘I don’t know… Excuse me…’ muttered the man, scared both by Raskolnikov’s question and by his strange appearance; and he crossed to the other side of the street.","muttered the stranger, frightened by the question and Raskolnikov’s strange manner, and he crossed over to the other side of the street."
"– Это все вздор, – сказал Свидригайлов, намачивая полотенце и прикладывая его к голове, – а я вас одним словом могу осадить и все ваши подозрения в прах уничтожить. Знаете ль вы, например, что я женюсь?","“It’s all nonsense,” said Svidrigailov, soaking a towel and applying it to his head, “but I can put you down with one word and destroy all your suspicions to dust. Do you know, for example, that I am getting married?","“It’s all nonsense,” said Svidrigaylov, wetting a towel and applying it to his head. “I can put you in your place with one word and demolish all your suspicions. Do you know, for example, that I’m getting married?”","‘That’s all nonsense,’ said Svidrigailov, moistening a cloth and pressing it against his forehead. ‘I can confound you with a single word, and explode all your suspicions. Do you know, for one thing, that I’m getting married?’","“That’s all nonsense!” said Svidrigailov, wetting a towel and putting it to his head. “But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your suspicions. Do you know that I am going to get married?”"
"– Много ль за часы-то, Алена Ивановна?","- How many for hours, Alena Ivanovna?","“How much for this watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”","‘How much can you give me for the watch, Aliona Ivanovna?’","“How much will you give me for the watch, Aliona Ivanovna?”"
"Со всех сторон раздались восклицания, все обратились к нему. Даже Петр Петрович взволновался.","From all sides there were exclamations, all turned to him. Even Pyotr Petrovich was agitated.","Exclamations arose on all sides, and everyone turned to him. Even Petr Petrovich was agitated.","There were exclamations of surprise on all sides, and everyone turned to look at him. Even Piotr Petrovich took notice.","There were exclamations from everyone, and they all turned to him. Even Peter Petrovich’s interest was aroused."
"– О Родя, полно! – горько воскликнула Дуня.","- Oh, Rodya, that's enough! Dunya exclaimed bitterly.","“Oh, Rodya, stop it!” Dunya cried bitterly.","‘Oh, Rodia, stop it!’ Dunia exclaimed bitterly.","“Oh, Rodia, hush!” cried Dunia bitterly."
"И он скрепился изо всех сил, приготовляясь к страшной и неведомой катастрофе. По временам ему хотелось кинуться и тут же на месте задушить Порфирия. Он, еще входя сюда, этой злобы боялся. Он чувствовал, что пересохли его губы, сердце колотится, пена запеклась на губах. Но он все-таки решился молчать и не промолвить слова до времени. Он понял, что это самая лучшая тактика в его положении, потому что не только он не проговорится, но, напротив, раздражит молчанием самого врага, и, пожалуй, еще тот ему же проговорится. По крайней мере, он на это надеялся.","And he braced himself with all his strength, preparing for a terrible and unknown catastrophe. At times he wanted to rush in and strangle Porfiry on the spot. He, even entering here, was afraid of this malice. He felt that his lips were dry, his heart was pounding, the foam was caked on his lips. But all the same, he decided to remain silent and not utter a word until the time was right. He realized that this was the best tactic in his position, because not only would he not let it out, but, on the contrary, he would irritate the enemy himself with his silence, and, perhaps, even the enemy would let it out to him. At least he hoped so.","He braced himself with all his might, preparing for some terrible and unknown catastrophe. At times he felt like hurling himself at Porfiry and strangling him on the spot. When he’d first come in, he had been afraid of his own rage. He felt that his mouth was dry, his heart was pounding, and foam was forming on his lips. But he still resolved to remain silent and not utter one word until it was time. He realized that this was the best tactic in his situation because then he wouldn’t say anything he’d regret later; on the contrary, he’d irritate his foe with his silence and perhaps Porfiry might even say something he’d come to regret later. At least, that was what he was hoping.","And he braced himself with all his might, ready for some unknown and dreadful catastrophe. There were moments when he longed to hurl himself at Porfiry and throttle him on the spot. Even when he was just arriving here, he’d been afraid of his own rage. He could feel his dry lips, his pounding heart, the foam around his mouth. But still he was determined to stay silent and not say a single word until the time came. He could see that this was the best tactic in his situation, since he’d not only avoid letting anything slip, he might even irritate his enemy by his silence, and the other might then let something slip himself. That, at least, was what he was hoping.","And he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal. At times he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. This anger was what he had dreaded from the beginning. He felt that his parched lips were flecked with foam, his heart was throbbing. But he was still determined not to speak till the right moment. He realized that this was the best policy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would be irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too freely. Anyhow, this was what he hoped for."
"Он был до того худо одет, что иной, даже и привычный человек, посовестился бы днем выходить в таких лохмотьях на улицу. Впрочем, квартал был таков, что костюмом здесь было трудно кого-нибудь удивить. Близость Сенной, обилие известных заведений и, по преимуществу, цеховое и ремесленное население, скученное в этих серединных петербургских улицах и переулках, пестрили иногда общую панораму такими субъектами, что странно было бы и удивляться при встрече с иною фигурой. Но столько злобного презрения уже накопилось в душе молодого человека, что, несмотря на всю свою, иногда очень молодую, щекотливость, он менее всего совестился своих лохмотьев на улице. Другое дело при встрече с иными знакомыми или с прежними товарищами, с которыми вообще он не любил встречаться… А между тем, когда один пьяный, которого неизвестно почему и куда провозили в это время по улице в огромной телеге, запряженной огромною ломовою лошадью, крикнул ему вдруг, проезжая: «Эй ты, немецкий шляпник!» – и заорал во все горло, указывая на него рукой, – молодой человек вдруг остановился и судорожно схватился за свою шляпу. Шляпа эта была высокая, круглая, циммермановская,[1] но вся уже изношенная, совсем рыжая, вся в дырах и пятнах, без полей и самым безобразнейшим углом заломившаяся на сторону. Но не стыд, а совсем другое чувство, похожее даже на испуг, охватило его.","He was so badly dressed that another, even a familiar person, would be ashamed to go out into the street in such rags during the day. However, the quarter was such that it was difficult to surprise anyone with a costume. The proximity of Sennaya, the abundance of well-known institutions and, for the most part, the guild and artisan population, crowded in these middle Petersburg streets and lanes, sometimes dazzled the general panorama with such subjects that it would be strange to be surprised when meeting a different figure. But so much evil contempt had already accumulated in the soul of a young man that, despite all his sometimes very young delicacy, he was least ashamed of his rags on the street. Another thing is when meeting with other acquaintances or with former comrades, with whom he did not like to meet at all ... Meanwhile, when one drunk who was not known why and where he was being transported down the street at that time in a huge cart drawn by a huge draft horse, shouted to him suddenly, driving by: ""Hey you, German hatter!"" - and yelled at the top of his lungs, pointing at him with his hand, - the young man suddenly stopped and convulsively grabbed his hat. This hat was high, round, Zimmerman's, [1] but all already worn out, completely red, all full of holes and spots, without brims and with the most ugly corner twisted to one side. But not shame, but a completely different feeling, even similar to fright, seized him.","He was so poorly dressed that someone else, even someone used to seeing such, would be ashamed to appear on the street during the day wearing such ragged clothes. However, the district was one where it was difficult to shock anyone with one’s apparel. The proximity of the Haymarket, the abundance of certain establishments, and, primarily, the population of tradesmen and craftsmen, all crowded into these streets and lanes of central Petersburg, sometimes filled the general panorama with such subjects that it would be strange to be surprised at all on meeting another such figure. But so much malicious contempt had already accumulated in the young man’s soul that, in spite of all his own sometimes very immature squeamishness, when he was out on the street he was not in the least embarrassed by his tattered clothes. It was another matter altogether when he met some of his acquaintances or former comrades, whom, in general, he didn’t much like seeing. . . . However, when one drunkard, who for some unknown reason was being transported somewhere along the street in an enormous cart harnessed to a huge dray horse, suddenly shouted to him, in passing, “Hey, you, you German hatmaker!” and roared as loud as he could, pointing his finger at him—the young man suddenly stopped and violently grabbed his own hat. It was a tall, round top hat bought at Zimmerman’s shop, but already worn out, and now of a completely faded reddish-brown color, with many holes and stains, lacking a brim, and leaning to one side at a most unattractive angle. However, it was not shame that seized him but a completely different feeling, more resembling fear.","He was so shabbily dressed that many people, even if used to it, would have felt ashamed to go out in daylight in such rags—although in a district like this nothing one wore could have surprised anyone. The proximity of the Haymarket,* the profusion of establishments of a certain kind, and the large numbers of factory workers and tradesmen among the population packed into these streets and alleyways of central St Petersburg, made up such a kaleidoscope of odd characters that there could be no call for surprise no matter whom you met. But this young man had stored up so much anger and contempt, that—for all his sometimes youthful sensitivity—he wasn’t in the least embarrassed by his rags in the street. It would be a different matter if he met anyone he knew, or any of his old classmates—and he didn’t like meeting them. But just at this point a drunk was carried past him on a huge cart, drawn by a giant carthorse, heaven knows why or where to, and this drunk as he passed suddenly yelled out at him, ‘Hey you, German hat!’ pointing at him and giving a full-throated roar. At this the young man suddenly froze and made a convulsive grab at his hat. It was a tall, round one from Zimmermann’s,* but completely worn out, brown with age, full of holes and stains, missing its brim, and knocked crooked to one side in the most grotesque way. Yet it wasn’t embarrassment but an entirely different feeling, more like terror, that now seized hold of the young man.","He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that part of town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. Due to the proximity of the Haymarket, the number of establishments of a certain kind and the overwhelming numbers of craftsmen and workers crowded in these streets and alleys at the center of Petersburg, so many different types of people were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however strange, would have caused surprise. But there was such accumulated spite and contempt in the young man’s heart, that, in spite of all the cares of youth, he minded his rags least of all. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge cart dragged by a heavy cart-horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past, “Hey there, German hatter,” bellowing at the top of his voice and pointing at him—the young man stopped suddenly and clutched trembling at his hat. It was a tall round one from Zimmermann’s,3 but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most hideous fashion. Not shame, however, but another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him."
"Ах, как я любила… Я до обожания любила этот романс, Полечка!.. знаешь, твой отец… еще женихом певал… О, дни!.. Вот бы, вот бы нам спеть! Ну как же, как же… вот я и забыла… да напомните же, как же? – Она была в чрезвычайном волнении и усиливалась приподняться. Наконец, страшным, хриплым, надрывающимся голосом она начала, вскрикивая и задыхаясь на каждом слове, с видом какого-то возраставшего испуга:","Oh, how I loved ... I loved this romance to the point of adoration, Polechka! .. you know, your father ... still sang as a groom ... Oh, days! Well, how, how ... so I forgot ... yes, remind me, how? She was in extreme agitation and struggled to get up. Finally, in a terrible, hoarse, tearing voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word, with an air of growing fright:","## Ah, how I’ve loved it. . . . I used to adore that romance. Polechka! You know that your father . . . used to sing that song when he was courting me. . . . Oh, those days! That’s what we ought to sing now! Well, how does it go? I’ve even forgotten. . . . Remind me, how does it go?” She was extremely agitated and tried to lift herself up. At last she began in a terrible, hoarse, broken voice, crying out and gasping on every word, with a look of growing terror:","Oh, how I loved it!… I used to simply adore that song, Polechka!… do you know, your father… used to sing it when we were courting… Oh, happy days! … Now, we ought to sing it now! But how, how does it go… no, I’ve forgotten it … Do remind me, how does it go?’ She was in a state of terrible agitation, struggling to lift herself up. Finally, in a dreadful, hoarse, broken voice, she began singing, crying out and gasping on every word, with an expression of mounting terror on her face:","“Ah, how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction, Polenka! Your father, you know, used to sing it when we were engaged . . . Oh those days! Oh that’s the thing for us to sing! How does it go? I’ve forgotten. Remind me! How was it?” She was violently excited and tried to sit up. At last, in a horribly hoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word, with a look of growing terror."
"– Пойдем, пойдем! – говорит отец, – пьяные, шалят, дураки: пойдем, не смотри! – и хочет увести его, но он вырывается из его рук и, не помня себя, бежит к лошадке. Но уж бедной лошадке плохо. Она задыхается, останавливается, опять дергает, чуть не падает.","- Let's go, let's go! - says the father, - drunk, playing naughty, fools: let's go, don't look! - and wants to take him away, but he breaks free from his hands and, not remembering himself, runs to the horse. But the poor horse is bad. She gasps, stops, twitches again, almost falls.","“Let’s go, let’s go!” his father says. “They’re drunk, misbehaving, those fools: let’s go. Don’t look!” He tries to lead his son away, but the boy breaks from his father’s arms; beside himself, he runs toward the horse. But the poor horse is on her last legs. Gasping for breath, she stops, and then tries to pull again, about to drop.","‘Come away, come away!’ replies his father. ‘They’re drunk, they’re fooling around like silly idiots. Come along, don’t look!’ And he wants to lead him away, but the boy breaks free, and almost out of his mind he rushes over to the horse. But the poor little horse is in a bad way by now. It pants, stops still, tugs forward again, and almost falls.","“Come along, come along!” says his father. “They are drunk and foolish, having fun; come away, don’t look!” and he tries to lead him away, but he tears himself away from his hand, and, beside himself with horror, runs to the horse. But the poor horse is already in a bad way. She is gasping, pausing, then tugging again and almost falling."
"– А сюрпризик-то не хотите разве посмотреть? – захихикал Порфирий, опять схватывая его немного повыше локтя и останавливая у дверей. Он, видимо, становился все веселее и игривее, что окончательно выводило из себя Раскольникова.","“Don’t you want to see the surprise?” giggled Porfiry, again grabbing him a little above the elbow and stopping him at the door. He, apparently, became more and more cheerful and playful, which finally infuriated Raskolnikov.","“Don’t you want to see the little surprise I have?” Porfiry said with a giggle, once again grabbing him a little above his elbow and stopping him at the door. He was clearly becoming more and more cheerful and playful, and that positively caused Raskolnikov to lose control of himself.","‘But wouldn’t you like to see a little surprise?’ chuckled Porfiry, again taking hold of his arm a little above the elbow and stopping him by the door. He was clearly growing ever more high-spirited and playful, and this was driving Raskolnikov into an utter frenzy.","“And won’t you see my little surprise?” chuckled Porfiry, again taking him by the arm and stopping him at the door. He seemed to become more playful and good-humored which maddened Raskolnikov."

III,III,III,Chapter III,CHAPTER THREE
"Главное дело было в том, что он, до самой последней минуты, никак не ожидал подобной развязки. Он куражился до последней черты, не предполагая даже возможности, что две нищие и беззащитные женщины могут выйти из-под его власти. Убеждению этому много помогли тщеславие и та степень самоуверенности, которую лучше всего назвать самовлюбленностию. Петр Петрович, пробившись из ничтожества, болезненно привык любоваться собою, высоко ценил свой ум и способности и даже иногда, наедине, любовался своим лицом в зеркале. Но более всего на свете любил и ценил он, добытые трудом и всякими средствами, свои деньги: они равняли его со всем, что было выше его.","The main thing was that he, until the very last minute, did not expect such a denouement. He swaggered to the last line, not even imagining the possibility that two beggars and defenseless women could get out of his power. Vanity and that degree of self-confidence, which is best called narcissism, helped a lot in this conviction. Pyotr Petrovich, having made his way out of insignificance, was painfully accustomed to admiring himself, highly valued his mind and abilities, and even sometimes, alone, admired his face in the mirror. But more than anything in the world, he loved and valued his money, obtained by labor and all means: they equaled him with everything that was higher than him.","The main point was that up to the very last moment, he had in no way expected such an outcome. He kept trying to embolden himself as best he could, not even admitting the possibility that two poor and defenseless women could escape his power. His conviction was fortified by his vanity and a level of self-confidence that could best be described as self-infatuation. Petr Petrovich, who had fought his own way out of poverty, had become accustomed to admiring himself to an extreme degree; he valued his own intelligence and abilities highly, and even sometimes, while alone, admired his face in a mirror. But more than anything else on earth, he loved and treasured his own money, earned by his hard work and other means: it made him the equal of everything above him.","The main thing was that up to the very last minute he had not at all expected things to end this way. He had maintained his overbearing manner without letting up, never believing it possible that two poor and defenceless women might escape from his clutches. That conviction was greatly furthered both by his vanity and by that degree of self-confidence that one might best call self-adoration. Piotr Petrovich, having fought his way up from nowhere, had become morbidly fond of admiring himself, and had a high opinion of his own intelligence and abilities; sometimes, when alone, he even used to gaze in admiration at his face in the mirror. But what he loved and treasured most of all in the world was his money, accumulated by hard work and every other means he could command. Money raised him to the level of everything that used to be above him.","THE FACT WAS THAT up to the last moment he had never expected such an ending; he had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that two destitute and defenseless women could escape from his control. This conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit which he took to the point of excess. Peter Petrovich, who had made his way up from insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated in solitude over his reflection in the mirror. But what he loved and valued above all was the money he had amassed by his work, and by all sorts of devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his superiors."
"Его почему-то занимало пенье и весь этот стук и гам, там, внизу… Оттуда слышно было, как среди хохота и взвизгов, под тоненькую фистулу разудалого напева и под гитару, кто-то отчаянно отплясывал, выбивая такт каблуками. Он пристально, мрачно и задумчиво слушал, нагнувшись у входа и любопытно заглядывая с тротуара в сени.","For some reason, he was occupied with singing and all this knocking and uproar, down there ... From there it was heard, as amid laughter and squeals, to a thin fistula of a reckless melody and to a guitar, someone was dancing desperately, beating out the time with their heels. He listened intently, gloomily and thoughtfully, bending down at the entrance and peering inquisitively from the pavement into the passage.","For some reason the singing and all that noise and commotion downstairs attracted him. . . . From there he could hear, amid the laughter and squeals, underneath the thin falsetto of the lively refrain and the accompaniment of a guitar, someone dancing for all he was worth, tapping out the rhythm with his heels. He listened intently, gloomily, and broodingly, leaning forward at the entrance, glancing curiously from the sidewalk into the room.","For some reason he was attracted by the singing and all the thumping and noise downstairs… He could hear the sounds of squeals and laughter, the strumming of a guitar, and a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air, while someone else was doing a frantic dance, beating out the time with his heels. He listened intently, gloomily, and thoughtfully, bending down on the pavement by the entrance and peering in curiously.","He felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and uproar in the saloon below . . . Someone could be heard dancing frantically inside, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently, gloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping inquisitively in from the pavement.—"
"Неотразимое и необъяснимое желание повлекло его. Он вошел в дом, прошел всю подворотню, потом в первый вход справа и стал подниматься по знакомой лестнице, в четвертый этаж. На узенькой и крутой лестнице было очень темно. Он останавливался на каждой площадке и осматривался с любопытством. На площадке первого этажа в окне была совсем выставлена рама. «Этого тогда не было», – подумал он. Вот и квартира второго этажа, где работали Николашка и Митька. «Заперта; и дверь окрашена заново; отдается, значит, внаем». Вот и третий этаж… и четвертый… «Здесь!» Недоумение взяло его: дверь в эту квартиру была отворена настежь, там были люди, слышны были голоса; он этого никак не ожидал. Поколебавшись немного, он поднялся по последним ступенькам и вошел в квартиру.","An irresistible and inexplicable desire drew him. He entered the house, went through the whole gateway, then into the first entrance on the right and began to climb the familiar stairs to the fourth floor. It was very dark on the narrow and steep stairs. He stopped at each landing and looked around with curiosity. On the landing of the first floor, the frame was completely exposed in the window. It didn't exist then, he thought. Here is the apartment on the second floor, where Nikolashka and Mitka worked. “Locked; and the door is repainted; is given, that is, for hire. Here is the third floor ... and the fourth ... ""Here!"" Perplexity seized him: the door to this apartment was wide open, there were people there, voices were heard; he didn't expect it at all. After a moment's hesitation, he climbed the last steps and entered the apartment.","An irresistible, inexplicable desire drew him. He entered, crossed under the gateway, then went into the first entrance on the right, and began climbing the familiar staircase up to the fourth floor. It was very dark on the narrow, steep stairs. He paused on each landing and looked around with curiosity. On the first-floor landing, the window frame had been removed from one window. “It wasn’t like that then,” he thought. Next he came to the apartment on the second floor where Nikolashka and Mitka had been working: “It’s locked; the door’s been freshly painted; that means it’s for rent.” Here’s the third floor . . . and the fourth . . . “Here!” He was struck with bewilderment. The door to the apartment was wide open, there were people inside, and voices could be heard: he hadn’t expected that at all. After hesitating a little, he climbed the last stairs and entered the apartment.","Drawn on by an irresistible, incomprehensible desire, he entered the building, walked through the gateway, took the first entrance on the right and started up the familiar staircase towards the fourth floor. The steep, narrow staircase was very dark. He stopped on each landing and looked curiously around. On the first-floor landing, one of the window frames had been taken out: ‘it wasn’t like that then’, he thought. And here was the second-floor flat where Nikolashka and Mitka had been working: ‘locked, and the door newly painted; so it’s up for rent’. And the third floor… and the fourth… ‘Here!’ He stopped in amazement: the door to the flat was wide open and there were people inside, he could hear voices. He hadn’t expected that at all. He hesitated a little, then climbed the last few steps and entered the flat.","An overwhelming inexplicable prompting drew him on. He went into the house, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth floor. The narrow, steep stairway was very dark. He stopped at each landing and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework of the window had been taken out. “That wasn’t how it was then,” he thought. Here was the apartment on the second floor where Nikolai and Dmitri had been working. “It’s shut up and the door’s newly painted. So they’re going to rent it.” Then the third floor and the fourth. “Here!” He was perplexed to find the door of the apartment wide open. There were men there , he could hear voices; he had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last stairs and went into the apartment."
– Поля? Ах да… Полечка! Это… маленькая… это ваша сестра? Так я ей адрес дал?,- Fields? Oh yes ... Polechka! Is that... little... is that your sister? So I gave her the address?,"“Polya? Ah, yes . . .

"– Да, понимаю и слышу-с! Вы и вчера говорили, что не в бреду, особенно даже напирали, что не в бреду! Все, что вы можете сказать, понимаю-с! Э-эх!.. Да послушайте же, Родион Романович, благодетель вы мой, ну, вот хоть бы это-то обстоятельство. Ведь вот будь вы действительно, на самом-то деле преступны али там как-нибудь замешаны в это проклятое дело, ну стали бы вы, помилуйте, сами напирать, что не в бреду вы все это делали, а, напротив, в полной памяти? Да еще особенно напирать, с упорством таким, особенным, напирать, – ну могло ли быть, ну могло ли быть это, помилуйте? Да ведь совершенно же напротив, по-моему. Ведь если б вы за собой что-либо чувствовали, так вам именно следовало бы напирать: что непременно, дескать, в бреду! Так ли? Ведь так?","Yes, I understand and hear! You said yesterday that you were not delirious, especially you even pressed that you were not delirious! Anything you can say, I understand! Eh!.. Yes, listen, Rodion Romanovich, you are my benefactor, well, at least this circumstance. After all, if you really, in fact, were criminal, or were somehow involved in this accursed business, well, would you, pardon me, insist yourself that you didn’t do all this in delirium, but, on the contrary, in full memory? Yes, especially to push, with such special persistence, to push - well, could it be, well, could it be, pardon? It's quite the opposite, in my opinion. After all, if you felt something behind you, then you should have pressed on: that you are certainly, they say, in delirium! Is not it? It is so?","“Yes, I understand you, and I hear you, sir! You also said yesterday that you weren’t delirious, you even insisted on that! I understand, sir, everything you can say! Hey! Listen to me, Rodion Romanovich, my good fellow, there’s this circumstance at least. If, as a matter of fact, you really were guilty, or in some way involved with this accursed business, would you be insisting that you weren’t delirious when you did it all and, on the contrary, were in full command of your faculties? And so very insistent, with such obstinacy, especially insistent—could this possibly be so, could it? In my opinion, it is just the opposite. If you really felt something was wrong, then surely it would make sense for you to insist that you were definitely delirious! Isn’t that so? Well, isn’t it?”","‘Yes, I understand, I hear you! Yesterday, too, you said that you weren’t delirious—in fact you made a particular point of it, that you weren’t delirious! I know everything you could possibly say to me! E-eh!… But listen to me, Rodion Romanovich, my very dear friend, just listen to this point. If you’d really and truly been a criminal, or been involved in this damned business in any way at all— well I ask you, would you yourself be insisting that you weren’t doing all this in a state of delirium, but in full possession of your senses? And insisting so particularly, so very stubbornly, making such an issue of it? I mean, could that ever happen? I ask you, could it? Surely if you felt in the least guilty about something, you ought to have been insisting that everything had happened in a delirious state! Isn’t that so? Aren’t I right?’","“Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious, you were particularly emphatic about it! I understand all you can tell me! A-ach! . . . Listen, Rodion Romanovich, my dear fellow. If you were actually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business, would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession of your faculties? And so emphatically and persistently? Would it be possible? Absolutely impossible, the way I see it. If you had anything on your conscience, you would certainly insist that you were delirious. That’s so, isn’t it?”"

"Старуха, как и всегда, была простоволосая. Светлые с проседью, жиденькие волосы ее, по обыкновению жирно смазанные маслом, были заплетены в крысиную косичку и подобраны под осколок роговой гребенки, торчавшей на ее затылке. Удар пришелся в самое темя, чему способствовал ее малый рост. Она вскрикнула, но очень слабо, и вдруг вся осела к полу, хотя и успела еще поднять обе руки к голове. В одной руке еще продолжала держать «заклад». Тут он изо всей силы ударил раз и другой, все обухом, и все по темени. Кровь хлынула, как из опрокинутого стакана, и тело повалилось навзничь. Он отступил, дал упасть и тотчас же нагнулся к ее лицу; она была уже мертвая. Глаза были вытаращены, как будто хотели выпрыгнуть, а лоб и все лицо были сморщены и искажены судорогой.","The old woman, as always, was simple-haired. Her blond, gray hair, her thin hair, as usual oiled with grease, was braided into a rat's pigtail and tied up under a splinter of a horny comb sticking out at the back of her head.

In one hand she still continued to hold the ""pawn"". Then he struck with all his might once and twice, all with a butt, and all on the crown of the head. Blood gushed out, as if from an overturned glass, and the body fell on its back. He stepped back, let her fall, and immediately bent down to her face; she was already dead. The eyes were goggled as if they were about to jump out, and the forehead and entire face were wrinkled and contorted with convulsions.","The old woman was bareheaded, as always. Her light-colored hair, sparse and with gray patches, smeared generously with grease as usual, was braided into a thin pigtail tucked under a comb of horn that stuck out at the nape of her neck.

She cried out, but very weakly, and suddenly collapsed completely onto the floor, although she’d managed to raise both hands to her head. In one she kept hold of the “pledge.” Then he struck her a second time and a third with all his might, still using the butt of the axe and hitting her crown.

"Порфирий Петрович, как только услышал, что гость имеет до него «дельце», тотчас же попросил его сесть на диван, сам уселся на другом конце и уставился в гостя, в немедленном ожидании изложения дела, с тем усиленным и уж слишком серьезным вниманием, которое даже тяготит и смущает с первого раза, особенно по незнакомству, и особенно если то, что вы излагаете, по собственному вашему мнению, далеко не в пропорции с таким необыкновенно важным, оказываемым вам вниманием. Но Раскольников в коротких и связных словах, ясно и точно изъяснил свое дело и собой остался доволен так, что даже успел довольно хорошо осмотреть Порфирия. Порфирий Петрович тоже ни разу не свел с него глаз во все время. Разумихин, поместившись напротив, за тем же столом, горячо и нетерпеливо следил за изложением дела, поминутно переводя глаза с того на другого и обратно, что уже выходило немного из мерки.","Porfiry Petrovich, as soon as he heard that the guest had a “deal” before him, immediately asked him to sit down on the sofa, sat down himself at the other end and stared at the guest, in immediate anticipation of the presentation of the case, with that heightened and all too serious attention, which even burdensome and embarrassing from the first time, especially due to unfamiliarity, and especially if what you state, in your own opinion, is far from being in proportion to such an unusually important attention paid to you. But Raskolnikov, in short and coherent words, clearly and precisely explained his business and was so pleased with himself that he even managed to examine Porfiry quite well. Porfiry Petrovich never once took his eyes off him the whole time. Razumikhin, seated opposite, at the same table, followed the presentation of the case with ardor and eagerness, constantly shifting his eyes from one to the other and back, which was already a little out of proportion.","As soon as he heard that his guest had a “small matter” to discuss with him, Porfiry Petrovich immediately asked him to sit down on the sofa. He himself sat at the other end of it and looked intently at his guest with the eager anticipation of hearing an explanation of the business, with exaggerated and overly serious attention, which can be oppressive and even confusing at first, especially for strangers, especially if what you are stating, in your own opinion, is out of proportion to the amount of unusually serious attention it receives. But in short and coherent terms, Raskolnikov clearly and accurately explained his business and was satisfied that he had even managed to take a good look at Porfiry. Not once did Porfiry Petrovich take his eyes off him all during that time. Razumikhin, who had taken the opposite seat at the same table, followed the explanation of the matter eagerly and impatiently, constantly glancing from one to the other and back again, which began to seem a bit excessive.","As soon as he heard that his visitor had ‘a bit of business’ with him, he straight away invited him to sit down on the divan, seated himself at the other end and fixed his eyes on him, in the expectation of having the business explained on the spot. He wore an expression of intense, even excessively serious attention—the sort of expression that would be sure to disturb and disconcert you from the start. Particularly if you were speaking to a stranger; and even more so if what you needed to discuss struck you as far too trivial to deserve such unusually solemn attention. But Raskolnikov set out his business in brief and coherent terms, clearly and precisely, and was so pleased with himself that he even managed to take a proper look at Porfiry. Porfiry Petrovich never once took his eyes off him. Razumikhin, sitting opposite them at the same table, followed the explanations with restless impatience, constantly shifting his gaze from one to the other and back again in a quite unnecessary way.","As soon as Porfiry Petrovich heard that his visitor had a little matter to settle with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such exceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so satisfied with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry. Porfiry Petrovich did not once take his eyes off him. Razumikhin, sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently, looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive interest."

"– Про вас же, маменька, я и говорить не смею, – продолжал он будто заученный с утра урок, – сегодня только мог я сообразить сколько-нибудь, как должны были вы здесь, вчера, измучиться в ожидании моего возвращения. – Сказав это, он вдруг, молча и с улыбкой, протянул руку сестре. Но в улыбке этой мелькнуло на этот раз настоящее, неподдельное чувство. Дуня тотчас же схватила и горячо пожала протянутую ей руку, обрадованная и благодарная. В первый раз обращался он к ней после вчерашней размолвки. Лицо матери осветилось восторгом и счастьем при виде этого окончательного и бессловного примирения брата с сестрой.","“I don’t even dare to talk about you, mother,” he continued as if he had learned a lesson from the morning, “only today I could figure out how you must have been exhausted here, yesterday, in anticipation of my return. - Having said this, he suddenly, silently and with a smile, extended his hand to his sister. But this time a real, genuine feeling flickered in this smile. Dunya immediately grabbed and warmly shook the hand extended to her, overjoyed and grateful. The first time he addressed her after yesterday's quarrel. The mother's face lit up with delight and happiness at the sight of this final and wordless reconciliation between brother and sister.","“As for you, Mama, I dare not speak about you,” he continued, as if he had been preparing a lesson that morning. “It was only today that I was able to imagine how you must have suffered here yesterday in anticipation of my return.” After saying this, suddenly and with a silent smile, he extended his hand to his sister. But this time some genuine, unfeigned feeling shone through his smile. Dunya immediately grabbed hold of his hand and squeezed it warmly, overjoyed and grateful. It was the first time he had addressed her after yesterday’s disagreement. His mother’s face glowed with ecstasy and happiness at the sight of this definitive, nonverbal reconciliation between brother and sister.","‘As for you, Mamenka, I don’t even dare say anything,’ he went on, as though reciting a lesson he had learned that morning. ‘It was only today that I realized how you must have suffered here yesterday, waiting for me to come back.’ Saying this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister, with a silent smile. But this time, his smile showed genuine, unfeigned emotion. Dunia at once grasped his hand and pressed it warmly, full of happiness and gratitude. This was the first time he had addressed her after their disagreement the day before. Their mother’s face lit up with joy and delight at the sight of this conclusive, wordless reconciliation between brother and sister.","“As for you, Mother, I don’t know how to begin,” he went on, as though repeating a lesson learned by heart. “It’s only today that I’ve begun to realize just how upset you must have been here yesterday, waiting for me to come back.” When he said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister, smiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real feeling. Dunia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his hand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had spoken to her since their argument the previous day. The mother’s face lighted up with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken reconciliation."
"– Бог меня прости, а я таки порадовалась тогда ее смерти, хоть и не знаю, кто из них один другого погубил бы: он ли ее, или она его? – заключила Пульхерия Александровна; затем осторожно, с задержками и беспрерывными взглядываниями на Дуню, что было той, очевидно, неприятно, принялась опять расспрашивать о вчерашней сцене между Родей и Лужиным. Это происшествие, как видно, беспокоило ее более всего, до страха и трепета. Разумихин пересказал все снова в подробности, но на этот раз прибавил и свое заключение: он прямо обвинил Раскольникова в преднамеренном оскорблении Петра Петровича, на этот раз весьма мало извиняя его болезнию.","“God forgive me, but I still rejoiced then at her death, although I don’t know which of them would have destroyed one another: would he be her, or she him? - concluded Pulcheria Alexandrovna; then, cautiously, with delays and incessant glances at Dunya, which was obviously unpleasant for her, she again began to ask about the scene between Rodya and Luzhin yesterday. This incident, apparently, worried her most of all, to the point of fear and trembling. Razumikhin recounted everything again in detail, but this time he added his own conclusion: he directly accused Raskolnikov of deliberately insulting Pyotr Petrovich, this time excusing him very little because of his illness.","“God will forgive me, but at the time I rejoiced at her death, although I really don’t know which of them would’ve ruined the other: would he destroy her, or would she destroy him?” Pulkheriya Aleksandrovna concluded. Then, cautiously, with hesitations and constant glances at Dunya, which, obviously, were not to Dunya’s liking, she started to ask about the meeting yesterday between Rodya and Luzhin. That event, apparently, disturbed her more than anything, inciting fear and trembling in her. Razumikhin related everything once more in detail, but this time he added his own conclusion. He bluntly accused Raskolnikov of intentionally insulting Petr Petrovich, hardly using his illness as an excuse.","‘God forgive me, I was glad to hear that she’d died, though I don’t know which of them would have driven the other into their grave, he or she,’ concluded Pulkheria Alexandrovna. Then she began, hesitantly and cautiously, with endless glances at Dunia which her daughter clearly found unwelcome, to question Razumikhin about the previous day’s scene between Rodia and Luzhin. This scene had evidently upset her more than anything, and she was in fear and trembling over it. Razumikhin told the whole story over again, in detail, but this time he added his own view of it, explicitly accusing Raskolnikov of intentionally insulting Piotr Petrovich, and scarcely trying to excuse him on the grounds of illness.","“God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I don’t know which of them would have caused more misery to the other —he to her or she to him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began questioning him tentatively about the scene on the previous day with Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dunia, obviously to the latter’s annoyance. This incident evidently made her more uneasy, perhaps even more disturbed, than all the rest. Razumikhin described it in detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Peter Petrovich and did not attempt to excuse him because of his illness."

"Человек остановился на пороге, посмотрел молча на Раскольникова и ступил шаг в комнату.

"Сначала, – впрочем, давно уже прежде, – его занимал один вопрос: почему так легко отыскиваются и выдаются почти все преступления и так явно обозначаются следы почти всех преступников? Он пришел мало-помалу к многообразным и любопытным заключениям, и, по его мнению, главнейшая причина заключается не столько в материальной невозможности скрыть преступление, как в самом преступнике; сам же преступник, и почти всякий, в момент преступления подвергается какому-то упадку воли и рассудка, сменяемых, напротив того, детским феноменальным легкомыслием, и именно в тот момент, когда наиболее необходимы рассудок и осторожность. По убеждению его выходило, что это затмение рассудка и упадок воли охватывают человека подобно болезни, развиваются постепенно и доходят до высшего своего момента незадолго до совершения преступления; продолжаются в том же виде в самый момент преступления и еще несколько времени после него, судя по индивидууму; затем проходят, так же как проходит всякая болезнь. Вопрос же: болезнь ли порождает самое преступление или само преступление, как-нибудь по особенной натуре своей, всегда сопровождается чем-то вроде болезни? – он еще не чувствовал себя в силах разрешить.","At first, however, for a long time before, he was occupied with one question: why is it so easy to find and give out almost all crimes and so clearly the traces of almost all criminals are indicated? He gradually came to diverse and curious conclusions, and, in his opinion, the main reason lies not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself; the criminal himself, and almost everyone, at the moment of the crime undergoes some kind of decay of will and reason, replaced, on the contrary, by a childish phenomenal frivolity, and precisely at the moment when reason and caution are most needed. In his conviction, it turned out that this eclipse of reason and the decline of the will cover a person like a disease, develop gradually and reach their highest moment shortly before the commission of a crime; continue in the same form at the very moment of the crime and for a few more time after it, judging by the individual; then they pass, just like any disease passes. But the question is: does the disease give rise to the crime itself or the crime itself, somehow by its special nature, is always accompanied by something like a disease? - he still did not feel able to resolve.","From the beginning—or, rather, for a long time before—he’d been preoccupied by one question: why are almost all crimes so conspicuous, so easily discovered, and the traces of almost all criminals revealed so obviously? Little by little he arrived at diverse and curious conclusions; in his opinion, the main reason was contained not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime, but in the criminal himself: the criminal himself, almost every one of them, at the very moment of the crime, is subject to some failure of willpower and reason, which are replaced, instead, by phenomenal childish thoughtlessness, precisely at the moment when reason and caution are most needed. According to his conviction, it turned out that this eclipse of reason and failure of willpower seize a person just like an illness, develop gradually, and reach their climax not long before the execution of the crime; they continue in the same form at the very moment of the crime and still for some time afterward, depending on the individual; then they pass away, as does any illness. The question remains: does the illness give birth to the crime itself, or is the crime, somehow by its own nature, always accompanied by something like an illness? He still felt it was beyond his power to resolve this question.","In the beginning—a long time ago—there had been one question that interested him. Why are almost all crimes so easily detected and solved, and why do almost all criminals leave such obvious clues? Little by little, he had reached all sorts of curious conclusions. In his view, the main reason lay not in the material impossibility of concealing a crime, but in the criminal himself. At the moment of committing a crime, the criminal himself—almost any criminal—suffers a sort of collapse of his will and reason, which give place to an extraordinary degree of childish thoughtlessness—and this at the precise moment when rational judgement and caution are most essential. And he became convinced that this clouding of the criminal’s judgement and collapse of his will come upon him like an illness, gradually progressing and reaching their peak shortly before the crime is committed. They continue unchanged through the moment of the crime itself and for some time after, depending on the individual. Then they pass off like any other illness. As for the question of whether the illness itself gives rise to the crime, or whether the crime, through its special nature, is somehow always accompanied by a sort of illness—that was a question he didn’t yet feel able to answer. Having come to these conclusions, he had decided that in his own personal case, no such morbid upsets could occur.","At first—long before, in fact—he had been extremely occupied by a single question; why are almost all crimes so badly concealed and so easily detected, and why do almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when reason and caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease, developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the individual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the crime, due to its own peculiar nature, is always accompanied by something like a disease, he did not yet feel able to decide. When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there could not be such morbid reversals, that his reason and will would remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the simple reason that his design was “not a crime . . ."

Because I sound like Schiller? And I bet you anything you think I’m flattering you now! And do you know, perhaps I really am, heh-heh-heh! Don’t you believe everything I say, Rodion Romanich; in fact, don’t ever believe in me completely; that’s just the sort of person I am, I grant you. But here’s what I’ll add: how much of a scoundrel I am and how much of an honest man, that’s something you can judge for yourself!’","“Who am I? I am a man with nothing to hope for, that’s all. A man perhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some knowledge too, but my day is over. But you are a different matter, there is life awaiting you. Though who knows, maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and come to nothing. Come on, what does it matter, that you will leave this class of men for another? It’s not comfort you regret, with your heart! What of it that perhaps no-one will see you for so long? It’s not time, it’s you that will decide that. Be the sun and everyone will see you. The sun, above all, has to be the sun. Why are you smiling again? Because I’m such a Schiller? I bet you’re thinking I’m trying to get round you by flattery. Well, perhaps I am, he-he-he! Perhaps you’d better not take my word for it , perhaps you’d better never believe it altogether; I’m made that way, I confess. But let me add, you can judge for yourself, I think, to what extent I am base and to what extent I am honest.”"

"Мармеладов стукнул себя кулаком по лбу, стиснул зубы, закрыл глаза и крепко оперся локтем на стол.

"Он остановился в раздумье под воротами. Идти на улицу так, для виду, гулять, ему было противно, воротиться домой– еще противнее. «И какой случай навсегда потерял!» – пробормотал он, бесцельно стоя под воротами, прямо против темной каморки дворника, тоже отворенной. Вдруг он вздрогнул. Из каморки дворника, бывшей от него в двух шагах, из-под лавки направо что-то блеснуло ему в глаза… Он осмотрелся кругом – никого. На цыпочках подошел он к дворницкой, сошел вниз по двум ступенькам и слабым голосом окликнул дворника. «Так и есть, нет дома! Где-нибудь близко, впрочем, на дворе, потому что дверь отперта настежь». Он бросился стремглав на топор (это был топор) и вытащил его из-под лавки, где он лежал между двумя поленами; тут же, не выходя, прикрепил его к петле, обе руки засунул в карманы и вышел из дворницкой; никто не заметил! «Не рассудок, так бес!» – подумал он, странно усмехаясь. Этот случай ободрил его чрезвычайно.","He paused in thought under the gate. It was disgusting for him to go out into the street, for the sake of appearance, it was disgusting to him, to go back home was even more disgusting. ""And what a chance lost forever!"" He muttered, standing aimlessly under the gate, directly opposite the janitor's dark closet, also open. Suddenly he shuddered. From the janitor's closet, which was two steps away from him, from under the bench to the right, something flashed into his eyes ... He looked around - no one. He walked on tiptoe to the janitor’s room, went down two steps and called out to the janitor in a weak voice. “So it is, no home! Somewhere close, however, in the yard, because the door is wide open. "" He rushed headlong onto the ax (it was an ax) and pulled it out from under the bench, where it lay between two logs; right there, without leaving, he attached it to the loop, put both hands in his pockets and left the janitorial room; nobody noticed! ""Not reason, so devil!"" - he thought, grinning strangely. This incident encouraged him tremendously.","He paused in the entryway to reflect. To set off along the street, just so, as if to take a stroll, just for appearance’s sake, was repulsive; to go back home was even more repulsive. “What an opportunity has been lost forever!” he muttered, standing aimlessly in the entrance, directly opposite the door to the caretaker’s small dark lodgings, also left open. All of a sudden he shuddered. From the caretaker’s room, only two paces away, under a bench on the right, something gleamed before his eyes. . . . He looked around cautiously—no one was there. He approached the lodge on tiptoes, went down two steps, and in a low voice called the caretaker. “Just as I thought, he’s not home! He must be close by, however, in the courtyard, because the door’s wide open.” He rushed at the axe (it was an axe) and pulled it out from under the bench, where it had been lying between two logs; right there, before he left, he secured the axe in the loop, thrust both hands into his pockets, and left the lodge; no one noticed him! “If not by reason, then with the devil’s help,” he thought, chuckling strangely. This chance occurrence bolstered him enormously.","He stopped in the gateway to think. To go out into the street, just like that, for show, and walk around, was more than he could bear. To go back home was even worse. ‘And what a chance I’ve missed, for ever!’ he muttered, standing irresolutely in the gateway, right in front of the porter’s dark little room, which was also standing open. Suddenly he gave a start. Inside the porter’s cubbyhole, a couple of steps away, something glinted at him from under a bench on the right… He looked all round—nobody! On tiptoe he walked up to the porter’s room, descended two steps, and in a faint voice called the porter. ‘There you are, he’s not at home! Though he must be close by somewhere, probably in the yard, since the door’s wide open.’ He flung himself at the axe (for it was an axe), pulled it out from under the bench where it lay between two logs; and straight away, before coming out, hung it in the loop, and shoved both hands in his pockets. Then he came out of the porter’s room. No one had noticed him! ‘If that wasn’t clever of me, then it was the devil’s work!’ he thought, with an odd smirk. He was extraordinarily cheered by this lucky chance.","He stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go for a walk for appearance sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more revolting. “And what a chance I have lost forever!” he muttered, standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter’s little dark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porter’s room, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the right caught his eye . . . He looked about him—nobody. He approached the room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called the porter. “Yes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for the door is wide open.” He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood; at once before going out, he secured it in the noose, thrust both hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no-one had noticed him! “When reason fails, the devil helps!” he thought with a strange grin. This incident raised his spirits extraordinarily."

А помните, как много мы в этом же роде и на эту же тему переговорили с вами вдвоем, сидя по вечерам на террасе в саду, каждый раз после ужина. Еще вы меня именно этой широкостью укоряли. Кто знает, может в то же самое время и говорили, когда он здесь лежал да свое обдумывал.

Anyway, you know my general outlook on life; I don’t blame anyone at all. I’m an idle fellow myself, and I stand by that. We’ve discussed that together several times. I’ve even had the good fortune to interest you in my views… You’re very pale, Avdotya Romanovna!’","“Ah, Avdotia Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was ever in very good order. Russians in general are broad in their ideas, Avdotia Romanovna, broad like their land and extremely disposed to the fantastic, the chaotic. But it’s a misfortune to be broad without a special genius. Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on this subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper? Why, you used to reproach me with breadth! Who knows, perhaps we were talking at the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan. There are no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class, Avdotia Romanovna. At best someone will make them up somehow for himself from books or from some old chronicle. But those are for the most part the learned and all of them are old, so that it would be almost ill-bred in a man of society. You know my opinions in general, though. I never blame anyone. I do nothing at all, I persevere in that. But we’ve talked of this more than once before. I was so happy indeed as to interest you in my opinions . . . You are very pale, Avdotia Romanovna.”"

He glanced timidly at Avdotia Romanovna, but at that moment her proud face bore an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such complete and unexpected respect (instead of sneering looks and badly-disguised contempt), that it threw him into greater confusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a subject for conversation, and he was quick to snatch at it."
"– Вы говорите, у Катерины Ивановны ум мешается; у вас самой ум мешается, – проговорил он после некоторого молчания.","- You say that Katerina Ivanovna's mind is in the way; your mind is getting in the way,” he said after a pause.","“You say that Katerina Ivanovna’s mind is muddled; your mind is muddled, too,” he said after some silence.","‘You said that Katerina Ivanovna was going out of her mind; you’re going out of your mind yourself,’ he said after a silence.","“You say Katerina Ivanovna’s mind is unhinged; your own mind is unhinged,” he said after a brief silence."
"Он даже успел сунуть неприметно в руку; дело, впрочем, было ясное и законное, и, во всяком случае, тут помощь ближе была. Раздавленного подняли и понесли; нашлись помощники.

Раскольников шел сзади, осторожно поддерживал голову и показывал дорогу.","He even managed to slip it inconspicuously into his hand; the case, however, was clear and legal, and, in any case, help was closer here.

Raskolnikov walked behind, cautiously supporting his head and showing the way.","He’d even managed to slip something into the policeman’s hand.

"– Но вы действительно, действительно сумасшедший! – вскричал Раскольников, не столько даже рассерженный, сколько удивленный. – Как смеете вы так говорить!","“But you are really, really crazy!” cried Raskolnikov, not so much angry as surprised. “How dare you say that!","“You’re insane, really, insane!” cried Raskolnikov, not so much angry as astonished. “How dare you speak like this?”","‘But you’re really, really mad!’ cried Raskolnikov, not even angry so much as astonished. ‘How dare you talk like this?’ ‘I knew you’d start shouting.","“You’re absolutely insane,” cried Raskolnikov, not so much angered as astonished. “How dare you talk like that!”"
"– Вот то-то и есть, что нет! – прервал Разумихин. – Это-то вас всех и сбивает с пути. А я говорю – неловкий, неопытный, и, наверно, это был первый шаг! Предположи расчет и ловкую каналью, и выйдет невероятно. Предположи же неопытного, и выйдет, что один только случай его из беды и вынес, а случай чего не делает? Помилуй, да он и препятствий-то, может быть, не предвидел! А как дело ведет? – берет десяти-двадцатирублевые вещи, набивает ими карман, роется в бабьей укладке, в тряпье, – а в комоде, в верхнем ящике, в шкатулке, одних чистых денег на полторы тысячи нашли, кроме билетов! И ограбить-то не умел, только и сумел, что убить! Первый шаг, говорю тебе, первый шаг! потерялся! И не расчетом, а случаем вывернулся!","- That's what it is, that no! Interrupted Razumikhin. “This is what leads you all astray. And I say - awkward, inexperienced, and, probably, this was the first step! Assume the calculation and dexterous channel, and it will come out incredible. Assume the inexperienced, and it turns out that only one case has borne him out of trouble, but what does not happen to chance? Have mercy, but perhaps he did not foresee any obstacles! And how is the case going? - he takes ten or twenty ruble things, stuffs his pocket with them, rummages in a woman’s packing, in rags - and in a chest of drawers, in an upper drawer, in a casket, they found some clean money for fifteen hundred, except tickets! And he didn’t know how to rob, and only managed to kill! The first step, I tell you, the first step! lost! And not by calculation, but by chance he turned out!","“That’s precisely what he’s missing!” Razumikhin interrupted. “That’s what’s leading you all astray. I maintain that he was inept and inexperienced, and this was probably his first endeavor! If you assume he was a calculating and cunning rogue, then the whole thing turns out improbably. Assume an inexperienced fellow, and it turns out that it was chance alone that saved him from disaster, and what can’t chance do? He might not even have foreseen the obstacles he’d encounter! How did this affair proceed? He took items worth ten or twenty rubles, stuffed them into his pocket, searched around in the old woman’s trunk, among her clothes—but later, in her dresser, in a box in the top drawer, they find fifteen hundred rubles in cash, plus some notes! He didn’t know how to rob; he only knew how to murder! It was his first endeavor, I tell you, his first. He lost his head! It wasn’t calculation, but chance that saved him.”","‘That’s just the point—it isn’t!’ interrupted Razumikhin. ‘ That’s just what you’re all getting wrong. What I say is that he’s not clever, not experienced, and probably this was his first time! If you imagine it being planned by a clever villain, it doesn’t make sense. But if you imagine someone inexperienced, then it’s quite clear that there was just one lucky chance that saved him from disaster—and chance can do anything. I mean, perhaps he never foresaw any difficulties! And how does he set about it? He takes some things worth ten or twenty roubles apiece and fills his pockets with them, he burrows in the old woman’s trunk, amongst all her rags, and all the while there’s a box in the top drawer of her chest of drawers where they’ve found fifteen hundred roubles in cash, not to mention banknotes! He didn’t even manage to rob her—all he managed to do was kill her! It was his first time , I’m telling you, his first time, and he lost his head! And it wasn’t any planning on his part, it was pure luck that saved him!’","“That’s just what it wasn’t!” interposed Razumikhin. “That’s what throws you all off the scent. I don’t think he’s cunning or experienced; this was probably his first crime! Assuming the criminal planned it all out doesn’t work. Suppose he’s inexperienced: it’s clear that the only thing which saved him was chance—and chance can do anything. Perhaps he didn’t even foresee any obstacles! What did he do? He took jewels worth ten or twenty rubles, stuffed his pockets with them, ransacked the old woman’s trunk, her rags—and they found fifteen hundred rubles, besides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He didn’t know how to rob anyone; he could only carry out the murder. It was his first crime , I’m telling you, his first crime; he lost his head. He got off because he was lucky, not because he was experienced!”"

"Раскольникову показалось, что письмоводитель стал с ним небрежнее и презрительнее после его исповеди, – но странное дело, – ему вдруг стало самому решительно все равно до чьего бы то ни было мнения, и перемена эта произошла как-то в один миг, в одну минуту. Если б он захотел подумать немного, то, конечно, удивился бы тому, как мог он так говорить с ними минуту назад и даже навязываться с своими чувствами? И откуда взялись эти чувства? Напротив, теперь если бы вдруг комната наполнилась не квартальными, а первейшими друзьями его, то и тогда, кажется, не нашлось бы для них у него ни одного человеческого слова, до того вдруг опустело его сердце. Мрачное ощущение мучительного, бесконечного уединения и отчуждения вдруг сознательно сказались душе его. Не низость его сердечных излияний перед Ильей Петровичем, не низость и поручикова торжества над ним перевернули вдруг так ему сердце. О, какое ему дело теперь до собственной подлости, до всех этих амбиций, поручиков, немок, взысканий, контор и проч., и проч.! Если б его приговорили даже сжечь в эту минуту, то и тогда он не шевельнулся бы, даже вряд ли прослушал бы приговор внимательно. С ним совершалось что-то совершенно ему незнакомое, новое, внезапное и никогда не бывалое. Не то чтоб он понимал, но он ясно ощущал, всею силою ощущения, что не только с чувствительными экспансивностями, как давеча, но даже с чем бы то ни было ему уже нельзя более обращаться к этим людям в квартальной конторе, и будь это всё его родные братья и сестры, а не квартальные поручики, то и тогда ему совершенно незачем было бы обращаться к ним и даже ни в каком случае жизни; он никогда еще до сей минуты не испытывал подобного странного и ужасного ощущения. И что всего мучительнее – это было более ощущение, чем сознание, чем понятие; непосредственное ощущение, мучительнейшее ощущение из всех до сих пор жизнию пережитых им ощущений.","It seemed to Raskolnikov that the clerk had become more careless and contemptuous with him after his confession - but it’s a strange thing - he suddenly became very decisively all the same to anyone’s opinion, and this change happened somehow in an instant, in one minute ... If he wanted to think a little, then, of course, he would be surprised how he could talk to them like that a minute ago and even impose with his feelings? And where did these feelings come from? On the contrary, now, if the room were suddenly filled not with the district friends, but with his first friends, then, it seems, he would not have found a single human word for them, his heart suddenly emptied. A gloomy sensation of painful, endless solitude and alienation suddenly consciously affected his soul. It was not the meanness of his heartfelt outpourings before Ilya Petrovich, not the meanness and the lieutenant's triumphs over him that suddenly turned his heart over. Oh, what does he care now about his own meanness, about all these ambitions, lieutenants, German women, penalties, offices, etc., and so on! If they had sentenced him even to be burned at that moment, then even then he would not have moved, even he would hardly have listened to the sentence attentively. Something completely unfamiliar, new, sudden and never before happened to him. Not that he understood, but he clearly felt, with all the power of sensation, that not only with sensitive expansiveness, as before, but even with anything, he could no longer address these people in the block office, and whether it was all his brothers and sisters, and not quarterly lieutenants, then even then there would be absolutely no reason for him to turn to them, and even in any case of life; he had never before this moment experienced such a strange and terrible sensation. And what is most painful - it was more a sensation than a consciousness, than a concept; an immediate sensation, the most excruciating sensation of all the sensations he has experienced so far in his life.","It seemed to Raskolnikov that the head clerk had become ruder and more contemptuous of him after his confession, but strange to say—he suddenly felt that no one else’s opinion mattered to him at all, and this change seemed to take place in one single instant. If he’d wanted to consider it for a while, then of course he’d be astounded at how he was able to speak to them that way just a minute ago, and even impose his own feelings on them. Where had these feelings come from? On the contrary, now, if the room had suddenly filled up not with police officers, but with his closest true friends, even then, it seems, he wouldn’t have been able to find even one kind word to say to them, because his heart was suddenly so emptied of all emotion. Gloomy feelings of tormenting, unending loneliness and alienation suddenly and consciously took possession of his soul. It wasn’t the despondency of his heartfelt outpourings in Ilya Petrovich’s presence, nor was it this same despondency or the lieutenant’s triumph over him that affected his heart so suddenly. What did he care about his own baseness now, or all these ambitions, lieutenants, German women, procedures, offices, so on and so forth? Even if he had been sentenced to be burned alive at that very moment, even then he wouldn’t have batted an eye; it’s doubtful that he would’ve even listened attentively to his sentence. Something totally unfamiliar was happening to him, something new, unexpected, never before experienced. It wasn’t so much that he understood, but that he clearly felt, with all the strength of his feeling, that not only with his previous sentimental expansiveness, but even with whatever resources he had available, he was no longer able to communicate with these people in the police office, even if instead of their being just police officers, they were all his own brothers and sisters, even then he would have had no reason to communicate with them, not for anything in his life. Never before, up to this very moment, had he experienced any feeling so strange and so terrible. What was the most tormenting of all—was that it was more of a feeling than a conscious thought or perception, a spontaneous feeling, the most tormenting of all those feelings experienced by him in his life up to this point.","Raskolnikov had the impression that the head clerk had grown more offhand and contemptuous with him after his confession, but strange to say, he himself suddenly felt utterly indifferent to anybody’s opinion. That change had taken place all at once, in a single instant. If he could have given it any thought, of course, he might have been surprised at how he had been addressing everyone a minute earlier, and actually forcing his feelings upon them. Where had all those feelings come from? Indeed, if the whole room were now suddenly to become filled with all his closest friends, instead of these policemen, even then he would probably not manage to find a single sincere word to say to them, so empty had his heart suddenly become. He was aware of a dark sense of endless, anguished loneliness and estrangement suddenly invading his soul. It was not the indignity of his heartfelt outpourings to Ilya Petrovich, nor the lieutenant’s humiliating triumph over him, that had caused this sudden revulsion in his feelings. Oh, what did he care now about his own baseness, or all those ambitions, lieutenants, German ladies, demands for payment, police stations, and all the rest of it! Even if he’d been condemned to be burned that very minute, he still wouldn’t have moved from the spot, probably not even paid any attention to his sentence. What was happening to him was something he had never experienced before, something suddenly new and unheard-of. Not that he understood it in his mind; but he could clearly feel, with the full force of his emotions, that he was no longer able to communicate with these people in the district police office—not only by way of the sentimental outpourings of a few minutes ago, but in any way whatsoever. If they had all been his own brothers and sisters, instead of district police lieutenants, there would still have been no point in communicating with them, no matter what was happening in his life. Never before this moment had he experienced such a strange and terrible sensation. And worst of all was the fact that this was more a sensation than an awareness of an idea; it was a direct feeling, the most agonizing feeling he had ever experienced in his life.","Raskolnikov thought that the head clerk treated him more casually and contemptuously after his speech, but strangely enough he suddenly felt completely indifferent to anyone’s opinion, and this revulsion took place in a flash, in an instant. If he had cared to think a little, he would have been amazed, in fact, that he could have talked to them like that a minute before, forcing his feelings on them. And where had those feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled, not with police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he would not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart. A gloomy sensation of agonizing, eternal solitude and remoteness took conscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimental outburst before Ilia Petrovich nor the meanness of the latter’s triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart. What should he do now with his own baseness, with all these petty vanities, officers, German women, debts, police offices? If he had been sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would hardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening to him, something entirely new, sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood, but he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could no longer appeal to these people in the police office with sentimental outbursts, or with anything whatsoever; and that if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police officers, it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any circumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awful sensation. And what was most agonizing was that it was more a sensation than a conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonizing of all the sensations he had known in his life."

"Покончив с этим, он просунул пальцы в маленькую щель, между его «турецким» диваном и полом, пошарил около левого угла и вытащил давно уже приготовленный и спрятанный там заклад. Этот заклад был, впрочем, вовсе не заклад, а просто деревянная, гладко обструганная дощечка, величиной и толщиной не более, как могла бы быть серебряная папиросочница. Эту дощечку он случайно нашел, в одну из своих прогулок, на одном дворе, где во флигеле помещалась какая-то мастерская. Потом уже он прибавил к дощечке гладкую и тоненькую железную полоску, – вероятно, от чего-нибудь отломок, – которую тоже нашел на улице тогда же. Сложив обе дощечки, из коих железная была меньше деревянной, он связал их вместе накрепко, крест-накрест, ниткой; потом аккуратно и щеголевато увертел их в чистую белую бумагу и обвязал так, чтобы помудренее было развязать. Это для того, чтобы на время отвлечь внимание старухи, когда она начнет возиться с узелком, и улучить, таким образом, минуту. Железная же пластинка прибавлена была для весу, чтобы старуха хоть в первую минуту не догадалась, что «вещь» деревянная. Все это хранилось у него до времени под диваном. Только что он достал заклад, как вдруг где-то на дворе раздался чей-то крик:","Having finished with this, he thrust his fingers into a small gap between his ""Turkish"" sofa and the floor, fumbled around the left corner and pulled out a pawn that had been prepared and hidden there for a long time. This pledge was, however, not a pledge at all, but simply a wooden, smoothly planed plank, no more as large and thick as a silver cigarette box could be. He accidentally found this tablet, during one of his walks, in the same courtyard, where a workshop was located in the wing. Then he added to the plank a smooth and thin iron strip - probably from a fragment of something - which he also found on the street at the same time. Having folded both planks, of which the iron was smaller than the wooden one, he tied them together tightly, crosswise, with a thread; then, neatly and dapperly, he turned them into clean white paper and tied them up so that it would be wiser to untie them. This is in order to distract the old woman's attention for a while, when she begins to fiddle with the bundle, and thus seize the moment. The iron plate was added for weight, so that the old woman would not guess at least in the first minute that the “thing” was made of wood. All this was kept under the sofa for a while. He had just taken out a pawn, when suddenly somewhere in the yard someone shouted:","After finishing his sewing, he thrust his fingers into a small opening between his “Turkish” sofa and the floor, groped around inside the left corner, and pulled out the pledge he’d prepared long ago and hidden there. This pledge, however, wasn’t really a pledge at all, but simply a smoothly fashioned wooden block, no larger than a silver cigarette case in size and thickness. He’d come upon this block by chance on one of his walks, in a certain courtyard where a workshop was located in one wing of the building. Then he’d added a smooth thin metal strip to the block, most likely broken off from something, which he’d also found on the street at the same time. After putting the two pieces together, the metal smaller than the wooden one, he’d tied them together with string, fastened tightly crosswise; then he’d wrapped them neatly and smartly in clean white paper and tied them with a thin ribbon, also crosswise, and made the knot so that it would be difficult to untie. This was done in order to divert the old woman’s attention for a while, since she would begin to struggle with the knot and thus he could seize the moment. The iron plate had been added to give the pledge weight, so that at first the old woman wouldn’t guess that the “object” was made of wood. All of this had been kept hidden under the sofa in his room until the right moment. Suddenly, just as he’d picked up the pledge, he heard a voice coming from somewhere in the courtyard below shouting:","When he had finished, he slid his fingers into the narrow crevice between the bottom of his ‘Turkish’ divan and the floor, felt around near the left-hand end and pulled out the pledge he had prepared and hidden there a long time ago. This pledge wasn’t actually a pledge at all—it was nothing more than a little wooden board, planed smooth, no bigger and no thicker than a silver cigarette case. He had happened to find this bit of board on one of his walks, in a courtyard where there was a workshop in one of the outbuildings. Later on he had added a smooth, thin iron plate (probably an offcut from something) which he had found on the street the same day. Laying the board against the iron plate (which was a little smaller), he tied them tightly together with a thread, lengthwise and crosswise. Then he wrapped them up elegantly in a smart white paper packet, which he tied—again crosswise—with a length of thin tape, producing a knot which would be very complicated to unravel. This was in order to distract the old woman’s attention for a while, as she struggled with the packet, and thus give him a little time. He had added the iron plate as a makeweight, so that the old woman shouldn’t guess, at least for a moment, that the ‘item’ was made of wood. All these things he had so far kept under the divan. But no sooner had he got the pledge out than he heard a shout in the courtyard:","When he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening between his “Turkish” sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and pulled out the pledge, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This pledge was, however, not a pledge at all, but only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and thickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of a workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece of iron, some fragment, probably, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street. Putting the iron piece, which was a little smaller, on the piece of wood, he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while she was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip was added to give weight, so that the woman might not immediately guess that the “thing” was made of wood. All this had been stored by him beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when suddenly he heard someone shouting in the yard:"

Стало быть, уж и скрывать не хотят, что следят за мной, как стая собак! Так откровенно в рожу и плюют! – дрожал он от бешенства. – Ну, бейте прямо, а не играйте, как кошка с мышью. Это ведь невежливо, Порфирий Петрович, ведь я еще, может быть, не позволю-с!.. Встану, да и брякну всем в рожу всю правду; и увидите, как я вас презираю!.. – Он с трудом перевел дыхание. – А что, если мне так только кажется? Что, если это мираж и я во всем ошибаюсь, по неопытности злюсь, подлой роли моей не выдерживаю? Может быть, это все без намерения? Все слова их обыкновенные, но что-то в них есть… Все это всегда можно сказать, но что-то есть. Почему он сказал прямо „у ней“? Почему Заметов прибавил, что я хитро говорил? Почему они говорят таким тоном? Да… тон… Разумихин тут же сидел, почему ж ему ничего не кажется? Этому невинному болвану никогда ничего не кажется! Опять лихорадка!.. Подмигнул мне давеча Порфирий аль нет? Верно, вздор; для чего бы подмигивать? Нервы, что ль, хотят мои раздражить али дразнят меня? Или все мираж, или знают!.. Даже Заметов дерзок… Дерзок ли Заметов? Заметов передумал за ночь. Я и предчувствовал, что передумает! Он здесь как свой, а сам в первый раз. Порфирий его за гостя не считает, к нему задом сидит. Снюхались! Непременно из-за меня снюхались! Непременно до нас обо мне говорили!.. Знают ли про квартиру-то? Поскорей бы уж… Когда я сказал, что квартиру нанять вчера убежал, он пропустил, не поднял… А это я ловко про квартиру ввернул: потом пригодится!.. В бреду, дескать!.. Ха, ха, ха! Он про весь вечер вчерашний знает! Про приезд матери не знал!.. А ведьма и число прописала карандашом!.. Врете, не дамся! Ведь это еще не факты, это только мираж! Нет, вы давайте-ка фактов! И квартира не факт, а бред; я знаю, что им говорить… Знают ли про квартиру-то? Не уйду, не узнав! Зачем я пришел? А вот что я злюсь теперь, так это, пожалуй, и факт! Фу, как я раздражителен!

They spit in my face quite openly!” He trembled with rage. “Well, go on and beat me, but don’t play with me like a cat with a mouse. It’s not polite, Porfiry Petrovich; perhaps I won’t allow it, sir! I’ll stand up and blurt out the whole truth right in everyone’s ugly mug; you’ll see how I despise you!” He caught his breath with difficulty. “But what if it only seems so to me?

Openly spitting in my face!’ He was trembling with fury. ‘ Well then, knock me down if you like, but don’t play cat-and-mouse with me. That’s really rude, Porfiry Petrovich—and perhaps I won’t put up with it! … I’ll stand up and shove the whole truth in everybody’s face, and then you’ll see how I despise you!’ He panted for breath. ‘ But what if I’m just imagining it? What if it’s all a mirage, and I’ve got everything wrong, and I’m only getting angry because I’m naïve, and can’t manage to keep up my shameful pretence? Perhaps it was all unintentional? All their words are quite ordinary, but there’s something about them… One could always say all that, but still, there is something. Why did he say “in her place”? And why did Zametov add that I was talking “cleverly”? Why does he use that tone of voice? Yes… his tone… Razumikhin was sitting here too, so why didn’t he see anything? That innocent fool never does see anything! My fever again! … Did Porfiry wink at me just then, or not? That’s probably nonsense—why would he wink? Do they want to shatter my nerves, or are they teasing me? Either it’s all an illusion, or they know!… Even Zametov is being brazen… Is he being brazen? He’s changed his mind overnight. I had the feeling he would! He’s acting quite at home here, though it’s his first visit. Porfiry isn’t treating him as a guest—he’s sitting with his back to him. They’ve sniffed each other out! No question, they’ve sniffed each other out because of me! No question, they were talking about me before we arrived! … Do they know about the flat? If only it was all over quickly! … When I said that I’d run out yesterday to find myself a flat, he let it pass, he didn’t pick it up… But that was clever of me, to mention looking for a flat: that’ll come in useful! In delirium, so they say!… Ha! ha! ha! He knows all about yesterday evening! But he didn’t know that my mother had arrived… So that witch even marked down the date with her pencil!… No, you’re wrong , I shan’t give myself away! There are no facts here, nothing but a mirage! No, let’s have some facts from you! And the flat isn’t a fact, it was delirium; I know what to say to them… Do they know about the flat, though? I shan’t leave until I know! Why did I come here? And my being in a rage now, that’s a fact too, I suppose. Phew, how short-tempered I am! But perhaps that’s a good thing, if I’m playing the part of a sick man… He’s probing me. Wants to get me confused. Why did I come?’","“The worst of it is they don’t try to hide it; they don’t even stand on ceremony! And how if you didn’t know me at all, did you come to talk to Nikodim Fomich about me? So they didn’t care to hide that they are tracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.” He was shaking with rage. “Come on, strike me openly, don’t play with me like a cat with a mouse. It’s hardly fair, Porfiry Petrovich, but perhaps I won’t allow it! I’ll get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly faces, and you’ll see how much I hate you.” He could hardly breathe. “And what if it’s just my imagination? What if I’m making a mistake, getting angry through inexperience and failing to keep up my wretched part? Perhaps it’s all unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there’s something about them . . . Whatever you say, there’s something. Why did he say it so bluntly—‘With her’? Why did Zametov add that I was talking ‘skillfully’? Why are they speaking in that tone? Yes, the tone . . . Razumikhin is sitting here, why doesn’t he see anything? That innocent blockhead never sees anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of course it’s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me? Either it’s my imagination or they know! Even Zametov is rude . . . Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind. I predicted he’d change his mind! He’s at home here; it’s my first visit. Porfiry doesn’t treat him like a visitor: he sits with his back to him. They’re as thick as thieves over me, there’s no doubt about it! No doubt they were talking about me before we came. Do they know about the apartment? If only they’d hurry up! When I said that I ran away to take an apartment he let it pass . . . I put that in cleverly about an apartment, it may come in useful later . . . Delirious . . . ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last night! He didn’t know about my mother’s arrival! The hag had written the date on in pencil! You’re wrong, you won’t catch me! There are no facts . . . it’s all supposition! You produce facts! Even the apartment isn’t a fact, it’s a delirium. I know what to say to them . . . Do they know about the apartment? I won’t go without finding out. What did I come for? But maybe the fact that I’m angry now is a fact! I’m an idiot for getting so irritable! Perhaps that’s right; to play the invalid . . . He’s feeling for a way in. He’ll try to catch me out. Why did I come?”"

"Наконец, пришло ему в голову, что не лучше ли будет пойти куда-нибудь на Неву? Там и людей меньше, и незаметнее, и во всяком случае удобнее, а главное – от здешних мест дальше. И удивился он вдруг: как это он целые полчаса бродил в тоске и тревоге, и в опасных местах, а этого не мог раньше выдумать! И потому только целые полчаса на безрассудное дело убил, что так уже раз во сне, в бреду решено было! Он становился чрезвычайно рассеян и забывчив и знал это. Решительно надо было спешить!","Finally, it occurred to him that wouldn't it be better to go somewhere on the Neva? There are fewer people there, and more invisible, and in any case more convenient, and most importantly - farther from these places. And he was suddenly surprised: how he wandered for half an hour in anguish and anxiety, and in dangerous places, but he could not have invented this before! And that is why he killed only half an hour on a reckless deed, because it was already decided once in a dream, in delirium! He became extremely distracted and forgetful and knew this. It was absolutely necessary to hurry!","Finally it occurred to him that it might be better to go somewhere farther along the Neva. There would be fewer people and he’d be less noticeable; in any event, it would be more convenient; but the main thing is that it would be farther away from where he was now. He was suddenly surprised to realize that he’d been wandering around in anguish and anxiety for an entire half hour, and in dangerous places, yet he had been unable to come up with this idea until now! Consequently, he had wasted half an hour in a foolish enterprise that had already been decided in his sleep, in his delirium! He was becoming extremely absentminded and forgetful, and he knew that himself. He definitely had to hurry!","Eventually he had the idea that it might be better to go somewhere along the Neva River. There’d be fewer people about, and he’d be less visible, and anyway it would be more convenient, and— most important of all—he’d be further away from these parts. And suddenly he was astonished at the way he had just spent a whole half-hour wandering here, full of misery and dread, in these dangerous places, and hadn’t managed to work this out earlier! And the only reason he had wasted a whole half-hour on this pointless activity was that this was what he’d decided on in his sleep, while he was delirious! He was becoming very distracted and forgetful, and he knew that. Now he really had to hurry!","At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the Neva. There were not so many people there, he would be less well observed, and it would be more convenient in every way—above all, it was further off. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half hour, worried and anxious in this dangerous part of town without thinking of it before. And that half hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply because he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent and forgetful and he was aware of it. He must finish it quickly."

"– Фу! перемешал! – хлопнул себя по лбу Порфирий. – Черт возьми, у меня с этим делом ум за разум заходит! – обратился он, как бы даже извиняясь, к Раскольникову, – нам ведь так бы важно узнать, не видал ли кто их, в восьмом часу, в квартире-то, что мне и вообразись сейчас, что вы тоже могли бы сказать… совсем перемешал!","- Ugh! mixed up!

"Раскольников отдал перо, но, вместо того чтоб встать и уйти, положил оба локтя на стол и стиснул руками голову. Точно гвоздь ему вбивали в темя. Странная мысль пришла ему вдруг: встать сейчас, подойти к Никодиму Фомичу и рассказать ему все вчерашнее, все до последней подробности, затем пойти вместе с ним на квартиру и указать им вещи, в углу, в дыре. Позыв был до того силен, что он уже встал с места для исполнения. «Не обдумать ли хоть минуту? – пронеслось в его голове. – Нет, лучше и не думая, и с плеч долой!» Но вдруг он остановился как вкопанный: Никодим Фомич говорил с жаром Илье Петровичу, и до него долетели слова:","Raskolnikov handed over the pen, but instead of getting up and leaving, he put both elbows on the table and clutched his head with his hands. It was as if a nail had been driven into his crown.

The urge was so strong that he had already got up from his place to perform. “Should I think it over for a minute? - flashed through his head. - No, better without thinking, and off your shoulders!

"Раскольников до того устал за все это время, за весь этот месяц, что уже не мог разрешать теперь подобных вопросов иначе как только одним решением: «Тогда я убью его», – подумал он в холодном отчаянии. Тяжелое чувство сдавило его сердце; он остановился посредине улицы и стал осматриваться: по какой дороге он идет и куда он зашел? Он находился на – ском проспекте, шагах в тридцати или в сорока от Сенной, которую прошел. Весь второй этаж дома налево был занят трактиром. Все окна были отворены настежь; трактир, судя по двигавшимся фигурам в окнах, был набит битком. В зале разливались песенники, звенели кларнет, скрипка и гремел турецкий барабан. Слышны были женские взвизги. Он было хотел пойти назад, недоумевая, зачем он повернул на – ский проспект, как вдруг, в одном из крайних отворенных окон трактира, увидел сидевшего у самого окна, за чайным столом, с трубкою в зубах, Свидригайлова. Это страшно, до ужаса поразило его. Свидригайлов наблюдал и рассматривал его молча и, что тоже тотчас же поразило Раскольникова, кажется, хотел было вставать, чтобы потихоньку успеть уйти, пока его не заметили. Раскольников тотчас сделал вид, что как будто и сам не заметил его и смотрит, задумавшись, в сторону, а сам продолжал его наблюдать краем глаза. Сердце его тревожно билось. Так и есть: Свидригайлов, очевидно, не хочет, чтоб его видели. Он отвел от губ трубку и уже хотел спрятаться; но, поднявшись и отодвинув стул, вероятно, вдруг заметил, что Раскольников его видит и наблюдает. Между ними произошло нечто похожее на сцену их первого свидания у Раскольникова, во время сна. Плутовская улыбка показалась на лице Свидригайлова и все более расширялась. И тот и другой знали, что оба видят и наблюдают друг друга. Наконец, Свидригайлов громко расхохотался.","Raskolnikov was so tired after all this time, during this whole month, that he could no longer resolve such questions except by one decision only: ""Then I will kill him,"" he thought in cold despair. A heavy feeling squeezed his heart; he stopped in the middle of the street and began to look around: which road is he going and where did he go? He was on -sky Prospekt, about thirty or forty paces from the Haymarket, which he passed. The entire second floor of the house to the left was occupied by a tavern. All the windows were wide open; the tavern, judging by the moving figures in the windows, was jam-packed. Songbooks were pouring out in the hall, the clarinet, the violin were ringing and the Turkish drum was thundering. Women's screams were heard. He was about to go back, wondering why he had turned onto Prospekt, when suddenly, in one of the last open windows of the tavern, he saw Svidrigailov sitting at the very window, at the tea table, with a pipe in his teeth. This is terrible, it shocked him to the point of horror. Svidrigailov watched and examined him in silence, and, which also immediately struck Raskolnikov, it seemed that he wanted to get up in order to quietly have time to leave before he was noticed. Raskolnikov immediately pretended that he himself did not notice him and was looking, thoughtful, aside, while he himself continued to watch him out of the corner of his eye. His heart was beating anxiously. So it is: Svidrigailov obviously does not want to be seen. He took the receiver away from his lips and was about to hide; but, having risen and pushed back his chair, he probably suddenly noticed that Raskolnikov was seeing and observing him. Something similar to the scene of their first meeting with Raskolnikov happened between them, during sleep. A picaresque smile appeared on Svidrigailov's face and widened more and more. Both knew that both see and observe each other. Finally, Svidrigailov laughed out loud.","Raskolnikov had been so exhausted during all this time, for the whole past month, that there was no way he could resolve similar questions except for one solution: “Then I’ll kill him,” he thought in cold desperation. A painful feeling gripped his heart; he stopped in the middle of the street and began looking around: what road was he on and how far had he come? He found himself on Obukhovsky Prospect, about thirty or forty paces from the Haymarket, which he had just crossed. The whole second floor of the house on the left was occupied by a tavern. All the windows were open wide; the tavern, judging by the movement of the figures in the windows, was packed full of people. From the large room came the sound of songs, the music of a clarinet, a violin, and the beat of a Turkish drum. He could hear women squawking. He was about to set off in the opposite direction, not understanding why he had turned onto Obukhovsky Prospect, when all of a sudden, in one of the farthest open windows of the tavern, he saw Svidrigaylov sitting there by the window at a tea table, a pipe in his mouth. This was terrifying and struck him with horror. Svidrigaylov was observing and scrutinizing him in silence, which also struck Raskolnikov at once; it seemed as if he wanted to get up and slip out of the tavern surreptitiously so that no one would notice him. Raskolnikov immediately pretended that he himself didn’t recognize him; he looked to one side pensively, while he continued observing him out of the corner of his eye. His heart pounded in agitation. So it was: Svidrigaylov obviously didn’t want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth and started to get away; but, after he stood up and pushed his chair back, he suddenly noticed that Raskolnikov was looking at and observing him. Between them occurred something like the scene of their first meeting at Raskolnikov’s room when he was asleep. A mischievous smile appeared on Svidrigaylov’s face and began spreading across it. Both knew that each was looking at and observing the other. At last Svidrigaylov burst into loud laughter.","Raskolnikov had grown so exhausted over this time, over this whole month, that he could only think of one way to solve this sort of problem. ‘Then I’ll kill him,’ he thought in cold desperation. His heart was suddenly weighed down; he stopped in the middle of the road and looked around him, wondering which street he was on and how he had got there. He was on ——sky Prospekt, thirty or forty yards from the Haymarket, which he had just crossed. * The whole second floor of the house on his left had been taken over as a tavern. All the windows were wide open, and judging from the figures moving about by the windows, the place was full to bursting. There were sounds of singing, a clarinet and a fiddle playing, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women squealing. He made to turn back, wondering why he had come onto ——sky Prospekt; but suddenly he noticed Svidrigailov, sitting at a tea-table right next to one of the wide-open end windows, and holding a pipe between his teeth. This sight astonished and horrified him. Svidrigailov was silently watching and examining him, and another thing that instantly struck Raskolnikov was that Svidrigailov seemed to be intending to get up and slip silently away before he was noticed. Raskolnikov immediately pretended not to have noticed him either, and affected to be looking thoughtfully away to one side, while still watching Svidrigailov out of the corner of his eye. His heart was pounding with anxiety. He was right: Svidrigailov evidently didn’t want to be seen. He had taken the pipe out of his mouth and was already on the point of disappearing; but after standing up and pushing his chair aside, he seemed to suddenly realize that Raskolnikov could see him and was watching him. What passed between them now was rather like their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s lodgings, when Svidrigailov had come while Raskolnikov was asleep. A mischievous grin appeared on Svidrigailov’s face, and grew gradually wider. Each of them knew that he could see the other, and was watching him. Eventually Svidrigailov burst into a loud guffaw.","Raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had been through that month that he could only decide this type of question in one way. “Then I shall kill him,” he thought in cold despair. A sudden anguish oppressed his heart; he stood still in the middle of the street and began looking around to see where he was and which way he was going. He found himself in X. Prospect thirty or forty yards from the Haymarket, through which he had come. The whole second storey of the house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were full to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarinets and violins, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking. He was about to turn back wondering why he had come to X. Prospect, when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw Svidrigailov, sitting at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth. Raskolnikov was completely taken aback, almost terrified. Svidrigailov was silently watching and scrutinizing him, and what struck Raskolnikov at once was that he seemed to be intending to get up and slip away unobserved. Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be looking absentmindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye. His heart was beating violently. Yet it was evident that Svidrigailov did not want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth and was about to hide himself, but as he got up and moved his chair back, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen him and was watching him. What had passed between them was much the same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room. A sly smile came into Svidrigailov’s face and grew broader and broader. Both of them knew that they had been seen and were being watched by the other. At last Svidrigailov broke into a loud laugh."
"«Что ж, неужели я все дело хотел поправить одним Разумихиным и всему исход нашел в Разумихине?» – спрашивал он себя с удивлением.","""Well, did I really want to fix the whole thing with Razumikhin alone and found an outcome for everything in Razumikhin?"" He asked himself in surprise.","“So, did I really want to resolve this whole matter with Razumikhin alone and find a way out through him?” he asked himself in astonishment.","‘Can I really have wanted to put the whole business right, just through Razumikhin—did I see Razumikhin as the solution to everything?’ he wondered in astonishment.",“Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by means of Razumikhin alone?” he asked himself in perplexity.
"Но все обошлось благополучно. Дверь в дворницкую была притворена, но не на замке, стало быть вероятнее всего было, что дворник дома. Но до того уже он потерял способность сообразить что-нибудь, что прямо подошел к дворницкой и растворил ее. Если бы дворник спросил его «что надо?» – он, может быть, так прямо и подал бы ему топор. Но дворника опять не было, и он успел уложить топор на прежнее место под скамью; даже поленом прикрыл по-прежнему. Никого, ни единой души, не встретил он потом до самой своей комнаты; хозяйкина дверь была заперта. Войдя к себе, он бросился на диван, так, как был. Он не спал, но был в забытьи. Если бы кто вошел тогда в его комнату, он бы тотчас же вскочил и закричал.

But again there was no janitor, and he managed to put the ax back in its place under the bench; even covered it with a log as before. Then he met no one, not a single soul, right up to his room; the mistress's door was locked. Entering his room, he threw himself on the sofa, as he was. He did not sleep, but he was in oblivion.

"Но какая-то рассеянность, как будто даже задумчивость, стала понемногу овладевать им: минутами он как будто забывался или, лучше сказать, забывал о главном и прилеплялся к мелочам. Впрочем, заглянув на кухню и увидав на лавке ведро, наполовину полное воды, он догадался вымыть себе руки и топор. Руки его были в крови и липли. Топор он опустил лезвием прямо в воду, схватил лежавший на окошке, на расколотом блюдечке, кусочек мыла и стал, прямо в ведре, отмывать себе руки. Отмыв их, он вытащил и топор, вымыл железо, и долго, минуты с три, отмывал дерево, где закровянилось, пробуя кровь даже мылом. Затем все оттер бельем, которое тут же сушилось на веревке, протянутой через кухню, и потом долго, со вниманием, осматривал топор у окна. Следов не осталось, только древко еще было сырое. Тщательно вложил он топор в петлю под пальто. Затем, сколько позволял свет в тусклой кухне, осмотрел пальто, панталоны, сапоги. Снаружи с первого взгляда как будто ничего не было; только на сапогах были пятна. Он помочил тряпку и оттер сапоги. Он знал, впрочем, что нехорошо разглядывает, что, может быть, есть что-нибудь в глаза бросающееся, чего он не замечает. В раздумье стал он среди комнаты. Мучительная, темная мысль поднималась в нем – мысль, что он сумасшествует и что в эту минуту не в силах ни рассудить, ни себя защитить, что вовсе, может быть, не то надо делать, что он теперь делает… «Боже мой! Надо бежать, бежать!» – пробормотал он и бросился в переднюю. Но здесь ожидал его такой ужас, какого, конечно, он еще ни разу не испытывал.","But a kind of absent-mindedness, as if even thoughtfulness, began to take possession of him little by little: for minutes he seemed to forget, or, better to say, forgot about the main thing and stuck to the little things. However, looking into the kitchen and seeing a bucket on the bench half full of water, he thought to wash his hands and an ax. His hands were bloody and sticky. He lowered the ax with a blade directly into the water, grabbed a piece of soap lying on the window, on a split saucer, and began, right in the bucket, to wash his hands. After washing them, he pulled out the ax, washed the iron, and for a long time, about three minutes, washed the wood, where it was stained, trying the blood even with soap. Then he wiped everything off with linen, which was immediately dried on a rope stretched through the kitchen, and then for a long time, with attention, examined the ax by the window. There were no traces left, only the shaft was still damp. He carefully put the ax into the loop under his coat. Then, as much as the light allowed in the dim kitchen, he examined his coats, trousers, boots. Outside, at first glance, it was as if nothing had happened; only the boots were stained. He wet the rag and wiped off the boots. He knew, however, that he was not looking well, that perhaps there was something striking in the eye that he did not notice. In thought, he stood in the middle of the room. An agonizing, dark thought arose in him - the thought that he was insane and that at that moment he could neither reason nor defend himself, that perhaps it was not necessary to do what he was doing now ... “My God! We must run, run! "" He muttered and rushed into the hall. But here such a horror awaited him, which, of course, he had never experienced before.","But some sort of absentmindedness, as it were, even pensiveness, gradually began to overwhelm him; for a few moments he seemed even to fall into oblivion, or, more accurately, he kept forgetting the main point of the affair and focusing on details. But then, glancing into the kitchen and catching sight of a bucket half full of water sitting on a bench, he decided to rinse off his hands and the axe. His hands were covered with blood and sticky. He lowered the axe blade into the water, grabbed a piece of soap from a chipped saucer sitting on the windowsill, and began washing his hands right in the bucket. After doing so, he pulled out the axe, wiped off the iron blade, and for a long time, almost three minutes, scrubbed the wooden handle where it was covered in blood, even using soap to wash it away. Then he wiped everything with some laundry that was drying on a rope stretched across the kitchen; then, for a long time, he stood next to the window and with great attention examined the axe. There were no traces of blood left on it, but the wood was still damp. He carefully replaced the axe in its loop under his coat. Then, making use of the limited light in the dark kitchen, he inspected his coat, trousers, and boots. At first glance, there appeared to be nothing wrong: only a few spots of blood on his boots. He soaked a rag and wiped them off. He knew, however, that he was unable to see very well; perhaps there was something he hadn’t noticed that might strike someone. He stood in the middle of the room, deep in thought. A tormenting, dark idea arose in him— the idea that he was behaving like a madman and that at this moment he was no longer able to reason or defend himself, and that perhaps it was totally unnecessary to do what he was doing now. . . . “My God! I must get away, run away!” he muttered and rushed into the entrance hall. But there such a terror awaited him—one, of course, that he’d never experienced before.","But gradually he was succumbing to a kind of distraction, even pensiveness; at times he seemed to forget himself, or rather to forget the most important things while clinging to trivial details. But happening to look into the kitchen, and noticing a bucket half full of water on the bench, he did think to wash his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky and covered in blood. He lowered the axe blade straight into the water, took a piece of soap from a cracked saucer on the windowsill, and started to wash his hands in the bucket. When he had done, he lifted out the axe, washed the iron blade, and spent a long time, three minutes or so, washing the wooden handle where it was stained with blood. He even attacked the blood with soap. Then he wiped everything with the linen hanging on the line that stretched across the kitchen, and took a long time carefully examining the axe by the window. There were no traces left, though the wood was still damp. He carefully replaced the axe in its loop under his coat. Then he inspected his coat, trousers, and boots, so far as the dim light in the kitchen allowed. On the outside, there seemed at first sight to be nothing visible, except for some stains on his boots. He moistened a rag and wiped his boots. However, he knew that he wasn’t seeing very well, and that there might still be something quite eye-catching that he hadn’t noticed. Standing in the middle of the room, he stopped to think. A dark and agonizing thought was taking shape within him—the thought that he was out of his mind, and that he was at that moment incapable of reasoning or protecting himself, and that all this might not at all be what he should have been doing. ‘ My God! I must get away! I must get away!’ he muttered, and rushed into the hallway. But here there awaited him a new horror, one that he had of course never envisaged.","But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess had begun by degrees to take possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what was of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he did realize that he needed to wash his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood. He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands right there in the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where there were spots of blood, even rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and then he spent a long time attentively examining the axe at the window. There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat, his trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be nothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots. But he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something quite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the room, lost in thought. A dark agonizing thought rose in his mind— the thought that he was going mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning, of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something utterly different from what he was now doing. “Good God!” he muttered “I must run, run,” and he rushed into the entryway. But here a shock of terror awaited him such as he had never of course known before."

"– Стой! Конца слушай!

Пришел он туда, снял с себя крест, серебряный, и попросил за крест шкалик. Дали. Погодя немного минут, баба в коровник пошла и видит в щель: он рядом в сарае к балке кушак привязал, петлю сделал; стал на обрубок и хочет себе петлю на шею надеть; баба вскрикнула благим матом, сбежались: «Так вот ты каков!» – «А ведите меня, говорит, в такую-то часть, во всем повинюсь». Ну, его с надлежащими онёрами[30] и представили в такую-то часть, сюда то есть. Ну то, се, кто, как, сколько лет – «двадцать два» – и прочее и прочее.

He came there, took off the silver cross, and asked for a scale for the cross. Dali.

He’d pitched up there, taken off his silver cross, and asked for a glass of vodka in exchange. They let him have one. A few minutes later, a peasant woman went into the cowshed and peeped through a crack: he was in the barn next door, he’d tied his sash to a beam, made a noose, and he was standing on a block of wood and just about to slip the noose over his neck. The woman screamed her head off, and people came running, saying “ So that’s the sort of man you are!”—“Take me away”, says he, “to such and such a police station, and I’ll confess everything.” Well, they took him off with all due ceremony and presented him to such and such a police station, in other words here. Then they asked him this and that, and who and how, and how old he was—“twenty-two” he says— and so on and so forth. When they asked “While you were working with Mitry, did you see anyone on the stairs, at such and such o’clock?”, he says “Of course there may have been folk passing up and down, but not so as we’d notice.” “And did you hear anything, any particular noise or anything?”—“No, we didn’t hear anything special.” “And did you know, Mikolay, on that particular day, that this widow and her sister had been murdered and robbed on such and such a day and time?” “I didn’t know, I had no idea. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy Pavlich two days later, in his drink shop. ”—“So where did you get those earrings?”—“Found them on the pavement. ”—“Why didn’t you turn up to work with Mitry next day?”—“Because I’d gone out drinking. ”—“Where did you go drinking?”—“This place and that. ”—“Why did you run away from Dushkin?”—“Because I got really scared. ”—“What were you scared of?”—“Being sent down by a court. ”—“How could you be afraid of that, if you thought you weren’t guilty of anything?” Well, believe it or not, Zosimov, that question was put to him, in those precise terms, as I know for certain, I have reliable information. What do you think of that?’","“Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolai; they detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested; the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before yesterday they arrested Nikolai in a tavern at the end of the town. He had gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a drink for it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a block of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman screeched her hardest; people ran in. ‘ So that’s what you are up to!’ ‘Take me,’ he says, ‘to such-and-such a police officer; I’ll confess everything.’ Well, they took him to that police station— that is here—with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how old he is, ‘twenty-two,’ and so on. To the question, ‘When you were working with Dmitri, didn’t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a time?’—his reply was: ‘Sure, folks may have gone up and down, but I didn’t notice them.’ ‘And didn’t you hear anything, any noise, and so on?’ ‘We heard nothing special.’ ‘And did you hear, Nikolai, that on the same day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?’ ‘I never knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy Pavlovich the day before yesterday. ’ ‘And where did you find the earrings?’ ‘I found them on the pavement.’ ‘Why didn’t you go to work with Dmitri the other day?’ ‘Because I was drinking.’ ‘And where were you drinking?’ ‘Oh, in such-and-such a place.’ ‘Why did you run away from Dushkin’s?’ ‘Because I was very frightened.’ ‘What were you frightened of?’ ‘That I’d be accused.’ ‘How could you be frightened, if you felt free from guilt?’ Now, Zossimov, you may not believe me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it for a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?”"
"Конечно, он быстро успел разглядеть в Андрее Семеновиче чрезвычайно пошленького и простоватого человечка. Но это нисколько не разуверило и не ободрило Петра Петровича. Если бы даже он уверился, что и все прогрессисты такие же дурачки, то и тогда бы не утихло его беспокойство. Собственно до всех этих учений, мыслей, систем (с которыми Андрей Семенович так на него и накинулся) ему никакого не было дела. У него была своя собственная цель. Ему надо было только поскорей немедленно разузнать: что и как тут случилось? В силе эти люди или не в силе? Есть ли чего бояться собственно ему или нет? Обличат его, если он вот то-то предпримет, или не обличат? А если обличат, то за что именно, и за что, собственно, теперь обличают? Мало того: нельзя ли как-нибудь к ним подделаться и тут же их поднадуть, если они и в самом деле сильны? Надо или не надо это? Нельзя ли, например, что-нибудь подустроить в своей карьере именно через их же посредство? Одним словом, предстояли сотни вопросов.","Of course, he quickly managed to discern in Andrei Semyonovich an extremely vulgar and rustic little man. But this did not in the least discourage or encourage Pyotr Petrovich. Even if he had been convinced that all progressives were the same fools, then even then his anxiety would not have subsided. Actually, all these teachings, thoughts, systems (with which Andrei Semenovich attacked him so much) did not matter to him at all. He had his own purpose. He only needed to quickly find out immediately: what happened here and how? Are these people strong or not? Does he really have anything to fear or not? Will they rebuke him if he does something, or will they not rebuke him? And if they denounce, then for what exactly, and for what, in fact, are they denouncing now? Not only that: is it possible somehow to imitate them and immediately inflate them, if they are really strong? Is it necessary or not necessary? Is it possible, for example, to arrange something in your career through their own intermediary? In short, there were hundreds of questions.","Of course, he had quickly managed to discern in Andrey Semyonych an extremely vulgar and simpleminded man. But this neither undermined nor encouraged Petr Petrovich’s views. Even if he had been convinced that all progressives were such fools, even then his uneasiness would not have been alleviated. He himself had no particular interest in all these teachings, ideas, and systems (which Andrey Semyonych threw at him). He had his own aims. He merely wanted to discover as soon and as quickly as possible what had occurred here and how. Were these people influential or not? Did he personally have anything to fear or not? Would they denounce him if he embarked on some enterprise or not? And if they were to denounce him, then what for, exactly? And why were people being denounced these days? Moreover, could he not ingratiate himself somehow with them and deceive them, if they really were all that powerful? Was this necessary or not? Was it possible, for example, to advance his own career precisely through their intervention? In a word, there were hundreds of questions before him.","Of course he had quickly realized that Andrei Semionovich was an exceptionally ordinary, naïve man. But that had done nothing to reassure him or change his mind. Even if he had satisfied himself that all the progressives were just as stupid, that would still not have calmed his anxiety. None of the actual doctrines, ideas, and systems that Andrei Semionovich pestered him with, were of any interest to him; he had his own aims. All he needed was to find out, as quickly as possible—at once, in fact—what had gone on here, and how? Were those people in power or not? Did he personally have anything to fear, or not? Would he be denounced if he undertook some particular enterprise, or not? And if he was, what would it be for; what were people being denounced for these days? And not only that: wasn’t there some way of getting round them and tricking them, if they really were so powerful? Should he do that, or shouldn’t he? Might he not, for instance, use them to promote his career? In short, he had hundreds of questions to answer.","He relied on Andrei Semionovich for this and before his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current phrases. He soon discovered that Andrei Semionovich was a commonplace simpleton, but that by no means reassured Peter Petrovich. Even if he had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it would not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, the systems with which Andrei Semionovich pestered him had no interest for him. He had his own object—he simply wanted to find out at once what was happening here. Did these people have any power or not? Had he anything to fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what precisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up to them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the thing to do or not? Couldn’t he gain something through them? In fact hundreds of questions presented themselves."

"– Нет, не общее место-с! Если мне, например, до сих пор говорили: «возлюби» и я возлюблял, то что из того выходило? – продолжал Петр Петрович, может быть с излишнею поспешностью, – выходило то, что я рвал кафтан пополам, делился с ближним, и оба мы оставались наполовину голы, по русской пословице: «Пойдешь за несколькими зайцами разом, и ни одного не достигнешь». Наука же говорит: возлюби, прежде всех, одного себя, ибо все на свете на личном интересе основано. Возлюбишь одного себя, то и дела свои обделаешь как следует и кафтан твой останется цел. Экономическая же правда прибавляет, что чем более в обществе устроенных частных дел и, так сказать, целых кафтанов, тем более для него твердых оснований и тем более устраивается в нем и общее дело. Стало быть, приобретая единственно и исключительно себе, я именно тем самым приобретаю как бы и всем и веду к тому, чтобы ближний получил несколько более рваного кафтана, и уже не от частных, единичных щедрот, а вследствие всеобщего преуспеяния. Мысль простая, но, к несчастию, слишком долго не приходившая, заслоненная восторженностью и мечтательностию, а, казалось бы, немного надо остроумия, чтобы догадаться…","- No, not a common place, sir! If, for example, they still told me: ""love"" and I loved, then what came of that? - continued Pyotr Petrovich, perhaps with undue haste, - it turned out that I tore the caftan in half, shared it with my neighbor, and both of us were left half naked, according to the Russian proverb: ""You will go after several hares at once, and you will not reach a single one."" Science says: love, first of all, one yourself, for everything in the world is based on personal interest. If you love yourself alone, then you will do your business properly and your caftan will remain intact. But economic truth adds that the more private affairs are arranged in a society and, so to speak, whole caftans, the more firm grounds are for it, and the more the common business is arranged in it. Therefore, by acquiring solely and exclusively for myself, I just thereby acquire, as it were, for everyone and lead to the fact that my neighbor receives a somewhat more torn caftan, and no longer from private, isolated bounty, but as a result of general prosperity. The idea is simple, but, unfortunately, it did not come for too long, overshadowed by enthusiasm and dreaminess, and, it would seem, it takes a little wit to guess ...","“No, it is not banal, sir! If, for example, up to now I was told to ‘love my neighbor,’ and did so, what came of that?” continued Petr Petrovich, perhaps with excessive haste. “What came of it was that I tore my cloak in two, gave half to my neighbor, and we both wound up half naked, just like in the Russian proverb ‘If you chase two hares, you’ll catch neither.’ Science tells us to love ourselves first of all because everything on earth is based on personal interest. If you love yourself alone, then you’ll conduct your affairs appropriately, and your cloak will remain in one piece. Economic truth adds that the more private businesses we have in society and, so to speak, the more cloaks remain intact, then the firmer its foundations and the more will be accomplished for the common good. Consequently, in acquiring solely and exclusively for myself, I’m also acquiring for all, and making sure that my neighbor receives somewhat more than a torn cloak and not because of private, solitary generosity, but as the result of general advancement. The idea is simple, but unfortunately, too long in the coming, hidden by a penchant for enthusiasm and fantasy; it seems that a little cleverness is necessary to surmise that . . .”","‘No, it is no cliché, sir! If I had always been told to “love thy neighbour”, and I did so , what would be the result?’ continued Piotr Petrovich, perhaps too hurriedly. ‘ The result would be that I would tear my cloak in two and share it with my neighbour, and each of us would be left half-naked, for as the Russian proverb says, “chase several hares at once and you’ll catch none”. But science tells us: “Love yourself above all, for everything on earth is founded on self-interest.” * If you love yourself alone, you will manage your concerns properly, and your cloak will remain whole. And economic truth adds that the better that private concerns are managed in our society—the more whole cloaks there are, as it were—the firmer society’s foundations become, and the more the common good is promoted. Hence by acquiring wealth exclusively for myself alone, I thereby acquire it for all others too, and ensure that my neighbour gets something more than a torn cloak; and this comes about, not thanks to individual private bounties, but as a consequence of universal progress. The idea is a simple one, but has, regrettably, remained unrecognized for too long, overshadowed as it is by misguided enthusiasms and dreamy idealism; though it would apparently not take much intelligence to realize…’","“No, not a commonplace! Up until now, for instance, if I were told, ‘love thy neighbor,’ what came of it?” Peter Petrovich went on, perhaps too hastily. “It meant I had to tear my coat in half to share it with my neighbor and we both were left half naked. As the Russian proverb says, ‘catch several hares and you won’t catch one.’ Science now tells us, love yourself above everyone else, for everything in the world relies on self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly and your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organized in society—the more whole coats, so to speak—the firmer its foundations and the better organized common welfare shall be. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for everyone, and helping to get my neighbor a little more than a torn coat; and that is not because of my private, personal liberality, but because of a general advance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time reaching us because we have been hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet very little intelligence is needed to perceive it . . . ”"

"– Господи! – вырвался ужасный вопль из груди ее. Бессильно упала она на постель, лицом в подушки. Но через мгновение быстро приподнялась, быстро придвинулась к нему, схватила его за обе руки и, крепко сжимая их, как в тисках, тонкими своими пальцами, стала опять неподвижно, точно приклеившись, смотреть в его лицо. Этим последним, отчаянным взглядом она хотела высмотреть и уловить хоть какую-нибудь последнюю себе надежду. Но надежды не было; сомнения не оставалось никакого; все было так!

"Развеселившись, Катерина Ивановна тотчас же увлеклась в разные подробности и вдруг заговорила о том, как при помощи выхлопотанной пенсии она непременно заведет в своем родном городе Т… пансион для благородных девиц. Об этом еще не было сообщено Раскольникову самою Катериной Ивановной, и она тотчас же увлеклась в самые соблазнительные подробности. Неизвестно каким образом вдруг очутился в ее руках тот самый «похвальный лист», о котором уведомлял Раскольникова еще покойник Мармеладов, объясняя ему в распивочной, что Катерина Ивановна, супруга его, при выпуске из института танцевала с шалью «при губернаторе и при прочих лицах». Похвальный лист этот, очевидно, должен был теперь послужить свидетельством о праве Катерины Ивановны самой завести пансион; но главное, был припасен с тою целью, чтобы окончательно срезать «обеих расфуфыренных шлепохвостниц», на случай если б они пришли на поминки, и ясно доказать им, что Катерина Ивановна из самого благородного, «можно даже сказать, аристократического дома, полковничья дочь и уж наверно получше иных искательниц приключений, которых так много расплодилось в последнее время». Похвальный лист тотчас же пошел по рукам пьяных гостей, чему Катерина Ивановна не препятствовала, потому что в нем действительно было обозначено en toutes lettres,[64] что она дочь надворного советника и кавалера, а следовательно, и в самом деле почти полковничья дочь. Воспламенившись, Катерина Ивановна немедленно распространилась о всех подробностях будущего прекрасного и спокойного житья-бытья в Т…; об учителях гимназии, которых она пригласит для уроков в свой пансион; об одном почтенном старичке, французе Манго, который учил по-французски еще самое Катерину Ивановну в институте и который еще и теперь доживает свой век в Т… и, наверно, пойдет к ней за самую сходную плату. Дошло, наконец, дело и до Сони, «которая отправится в Т… вместе с Катериной Ивановной и будет ей там во всем помогать». Но тут вдруг кто-то фыркнул в конце стола. Катерина Ивановна хоть и постаралась тотчас же сделать вид, что с пренебрежением не замечает возникшего в конце стола смеха, но тотчас же, нарочно возвысив голос, стала с одушевлением говорить о несомненных способностях Софьи Семеновны служить ей помощницей, «о ее кротости, терпении, самоотвержении, благородстве и образовании», причем потрепала Соню по щечке и, привстав, горячо два раза ее поцеловала. Соня вспыхнула, а Катерина Ивановна вдруг расплакалась, тут же заметив про самое себя, что «она слабонервная дура и что уж слишком расстроена, что пора кончать, и так как закуска уж кончена, то разносить бы чай». В эту самую минуту Амалия Ивановна, уже окончательно обиженная тем, что во всем разговоре она не принимала ни малейшего участия и что ее даже совсем не слушают, вдруг рискнула на последнюю попытку и с потаенною тоской осмелилась сообщить Катерине Ивановне одно чрезвычайно дельное и глубокомысленное замечание о том, что в будущем пансионе надо обращать особенное внимание на чистое белье девиц (ди веше) и что «непременно должен буль одна такая хороши дам (ди даме), чтоб карашо про белье смотрель», и второе, «чтоб все молоды девиц тихонько по ночам никакой роман не читаль». Катерина Ивановна, которая действительно была расстроена и очень устала и которой уже совсем надоели поминки, тотчас же «отрезала» Амалии Ивановне, что та «мелет вздор» и ничего не понимает; что заботы об ди веше дело кастелянши, а не директрисы благородного пансиона; а что касается до чтения романов, так уж это просто даже неприличности, и что она просит ее замолчать. Амалия Ивановна вспыхнула и, озлобившись, заметила, что она только «добра желаль» и что она «много ошень добра желаль», а что ей «за квартир давно уж гельд не платиль». Катерина Ивановна тотчас же «осадила» ее, сказав, что она лжет, говоря, что «добра желаль», потому что еще вчера, когда покойник еще на столе лежал, она ее за квартиру мучила. На это Амалия Ивановна весьма последовательно заметила, что она «тех дам приглашаль, но что те дам не пришоль, потому что те дам благородный дам и не могут пришоль к неблагородный дам». Катерина Ивановна тотчас же «подчеркнула» ей, что так как она чумичка, то и не может судить о том, что такое истинное благородство. Амалия Ивановна не снесла и тотчас же заявила, что ее «фатер аус Берлин буль ошень, ошень важны шеловек и обе рук по карман ходиль и всё делал этак: пуф! пуф!», и чтобы действительнее представить своего фатера, Амалия Ивановна привскочила со стула, засунула свои обе руки в карманы, надула щеки и стала издавать какие-то неопределенные звуки ртом, похожие на пуф-пуф, при громком хохоте всех жильцов, которые нарочно поощряли Амалию Ивановну своим одобрением, предчувствуя схватку. Но этого уже не могла вытерпеть Катерина Ивановна и немедленно, во всеуслышание, «отчеканила», что у Амалии Ивановны, может, никогда и фатера-то не было, а что просто Амалия Ивановна – петербургская пьяная чухонка и, наверно, где-нибудь прежде в кухарках жила, а пожалуй, и того хуже. Амалия Ивановна покраснела как рак и завизжала, что это, может быть, у Катерины Ивановны «совсем фатер не буль; а что у ней буль фатер аус Берлин, и таки длинны сюртук носиль и всё делаль: пуф, пуф, пуф!» Катерина Ивановна с презрением заметила, что ее происхождение всем известно и что в этом самом похвальном листе обозначено печатными буквами, что отец ее полковник; а что отец Амалии Ивановны (если только у ней был какой-нибудь отец), наверно, какой-нибудь петербургский чухонец, молоко продавал; а вернее всего, что и совсем отца не было, потому что еще до сих пор неизвестно, как зовут Амалию Ивановну по батюшке: Ивановна или Людвиговна? Тут Амалия Ивановна, рассвирепев окончательно и ударяя кулаком по столу, принялась визжать, что она Амаль-Иван, а не Людвиговна, что ее фатер «зваль Иоган и что он буль бурмейстер», а что фатер Катерины Ивановны «совсем никогда буль бурмейстер». Катерина Ивановна встала со стула и строго, по-видимому спокойным голосом (хотя вся бледная и с глубоко подымавшеюся грудью), заметила ей, что если она хоть только один еще раз осмелится «сопоставить на одну доску своего дрянного фатеришку с ее папенькой, то она, Катерина Ивановна, сорвет с нее чепчик и растопчет его ногами». Услышав это, Амалия Ивановна забегала по комнате, крича изо всех сил, что она хозяйка и чтоб Катерина Ивановна «в сию минуту съезжаль с квартир»; затем бросилась для чего-то обирать со стола серебряные ложки. Поднялся гам и грохот; дети заплакали. Соня бросилась было удерживать Катерину Ивановну; но когда Амалия Ивановна вдруг закричала что-то про желтый билет, Катерина Ивановна отпихнула Соню и пустилась к Амалии Ивановне, чтобы немедленно привести свою угрозу, насчет чепчика, в исполнение. В эту минуту отворилась дверь, и на пороге комнаты вдруг показался Петр Петрович Лужин. Он стоял и строгим, внимательным взглядом оглядывал всю компанию. Катерина Ивановна бросилась к нему.","Cheered up, Katerina Ivanovna immediately got carried away into various details and suddenly started talking about how, with the help of the pension she had obtained, she would certainly start a boarding school for noble maidens in her hometown of T .... This was not yet reported to Raskolnikov by Katerina Ivanovna herself, and she was immediately carried away into the most seductive details. It is not known how the same “commendation sheet” suddenly appeared in her hands, about which the deceased Marmeladov informed Raskolnikov, explaining to him in the tavern that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, danced with a shawl “under the governor and with other persons” when she graduated from the institute . This commendation sheet, obviously, was now to serve as evidence of the right of Katerina Ivanovna to start a boarding school herself; but most importantly, it was stored up for the purpose of finally cutting off “both overdressed spanktails”, in case they came to the wake, and clearly showing them that Katerina Ivanovna was from the most noble, “one might even say, aristocratic house, the colonel’s daughter and certainly better than other adventurers, of whom there have been so many of late.” The letter of commendation immediately went through the hands of the drunken guests, which Katerina Ivanovna did not prevent, because it really indicated en toutes lettres[64] that she was the daughter of a court adviser and gentleman, and therefore, in fact, almost a colonel's daughter. Inflamed, Katerina Ivanovna immediately spread about all the details of the future beautiful and calm life in T ...; about the teachers of the gymnasium, whom she will invite for lessons in her boarding school; about one venerable old man, the Frenchman Mango, who taught Katerina Ivanovna herself in French at the institute and who is still living out his life in T ... and, probably, will go to her for the most reasonable payment. Finally, it came to Sonya, ""who will go to T ... together with Katerina Ivanovna and will help her in everything there."" But then suddenly someone snorted at the end of the table. Although Katerina Ivanovna immediately tried to pretend that she did not notice with disdain the laughter that arose at the end of the table, but immediately, deliberately raising her voice, began to speak with animation about Sofya Semyonovna’s undoubted abilities to serve as her assistant, “about her meekness, patience, selflessness , nobility and education, ”and patted Sonya on the cheek and, rising up, kissed her passionately twice. Sonya flushed, and Katerina Ivanovna suddenly burst into tears, immediately noticing to herself that ""she is a weak-nervous fool and that she is too upset that it is time to finish, and since the snack is already over, then tea would be served."" At that very moment, Amalia Ivanovna, already completely offended by the fact that she did not take the slightest part in the whole conversation and that they were not even listening to her at all, suddenly ventured on the last attempt and with secret anguish dared to tell Katerina Ivanovna one extremely sensible and thoughtful remark about that in the future boarding school it is necessary to pay special attention to the clean underwear of the girls (di veche) and that “one such good lady (di veche) must certainly be boule so that she looks carefully about the linen”, and secondly, “so that all young girls quietly I didn’t read any novel at night.” Katerina Ivanovna, who was really upset and very tired, and who was already completely tired of the commemoration, immediately “cut off” Amalia Ivanovna that she was “talking nonsense” and did not understand anything; that worries about the devil are the business of the housekeeper, and not the headmistress of a noble boarding house; and as far as reading novels, it's just plain indecent, and that she asks her to be quiet. Amalia Ivanovna flared up and, embittered, remarked that she only ""wished well"" and that she ""wished a lot of good things"", and that ""the geld had not paid her for apartments for a long time."" Katerina Ivanovna immediately ""suspended"" her, saying that she was lying, saying that she ""wished well,"" because only yesterday, when the dead man was still lying on the table, she had tormented her for her apartment. To this, Amalia Ivanovna quite consistently remarked that she ""invited those ladies, but that those ladies would not come, because they would give noble ladies and could not come to ignoble ladies."" Katerina Ivanovna immediately ""stressed"" her that, since she was a chumicka, she could not judge what true nobility was. Amalia Ivanovna did not take it down and immediately declared that her “vater aus Berlin bul osh, osh important man and walked with both hands in his pocket and did everything that way: poof! poof!"", and in order to really imagine her father, Amalia Ivanovna jumped up from her chair, thrust both her hands into her pockets, puffed out her cheeks and began to make some indefinite sounds with her mouth, similar to poof-poof, at the loud laughter of all the tenants, who on purpose encouraged Amalia Ivanovna with their approval, anticipating a fight. But Katerina Ivanovna could no longer endure this and immediately, publicly, “rapped out” that Amalia Ivanovna, perhaps, had never even had a fater, but that Amalia Ivanovna was simply a Petersburg drunken thin-haired girl and, probably, somewhere before she lived in the kitchen, and perhaps even worse. Amalia Ivanovna blushed like a lobster and squealed that it might be with Katerina Ivanovna “not at all a vater; and why did she have boule vater aus Berlin, and yet she wore a long frock coat and did everything: poof, poof, poof! Katerina Ivanovna remarked with contempt that her origins were known to all, and that on that very commendable sheet it was indicated in block letters that her father was a colonel; and that Amalia Ivanovna's father (if only she had any father), probably some Petersburg Chukhonian, sold milk; or most likely, that there was no father at all, because it is still unknown what the name of Amalia Ivanovna is after the father: Ivanovna or Ludvigovna? Here Amalia Ivanovna, completely furious and banging her fist on the table, began to screech that she was Amal-Ivan, and not Ludwigovna, that her vater ""call Johann and that he is a bull burmeister,"" and that Katerina Ivanovna's vater ""never bul burmeister at all."" Katerina Ivanovna got up from her chair and in a stern, apparently calm voice (although she was all pale and with a deeply heaving chest), remarked to her that if she even once again dares to “compare her wretched little father with her papa on the same level, then she , Katerina Ivanovna, will tear off her bonnet and trample it with her feet. Hearing this, Amalia Ivanovna ran up and down the room, shouting with all her might that she was the hostess and that Katerina Ivanovna “should move out of the apartments this very minute”; then, for some reason, she rushed to plunder the silver spoons from the table. There was a din and a roar; the children cried. Sonya rushed to restrain Katerina Ivanovna; but when Amalia Ivanovna suddenly shouted something about a yellow ticket, Katerina Ivanovna shoved Sonya aside and rushed over to Amalia Ivanovna, in order to immediately carry out her threat about the bonnet. At that moment the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin suddenly appeared on the threshold of the room. He stood and looked around the whole company with a stern, attentive look. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.","Having cheered up, Katerina Ivanovna was immediately distracted by various details and suddenly began talking about how, with the assistance of an obtained pension, she would definitely open a boarding school for noble young ladies in her home town of T——. Raskolnikov had not heard of this plan before from Katerina Ivanovna, and she immediately delved into all the most alluring details. It was not at all clear how that “certificate of merit” had suddenly turned up in her hands, the one that the late Marmeladov had mentioned to Raskolnikov, explaining to him in the tavern that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had done the shawl dance “in the presence of the governor and other distinguished people” at the institute graduation ball. This certificate of merit, obviously, was now supposed to bear witness to Katerina Ivanovna’s right to establish a school; but the main thing was, it was kept in reserve with the goal of finally putting those “two overdressed tail draggers” in their place, in case they came to the funeral feast, and to demonstrate clearly to them that Katerina Ivanovna was descended from a noble, “one could even say aristocratic, household and was a colonel’s daughter, and that she was much better than certain adventure seekers who had become so very common as of late.” The certificate of merit was immediately passed around by the drunken guests, which Katerina Ivanovna did not prevent, because it really did indicate en toutes lettres that she was the daughter of a decorated court councillor, and as a result, almost in fact a colonel’s daughter. Now inspired, Katerina Ivanovna soon enlarged on all the details of her future splendid and serene way of life in T——; about the gymnasium teachers she would invite to give lectures at her school; about a respectable old Frenchman, M. Mangot, who had once taught Katerina Ivanovna French in school and who was living out his years in T—— and would certainly agree to teach in the school for a very reasonable fee. Finally the plan included even Sonya, “who would accompany Katerina Ivanovna to T—— and there would assist her in everything.” But here someone at the other end of the table suddenly started chuckling. Although Katerina Ivanovna tried to pretend that she disregarded the laughter at the end of the table, she immediately raised her voice and began animatedly describing Sofiya Semyonovna’s unquestionable abilities to serve as her assistant, “her gentleness, patience, self-sacrifice, nobility, and her education”; then she patted Sonya on the cheek and, standing up, kissed her warmly twice. Sonya blushed, but Katerina Ivanovna suddenly burst into tears, remarking that “she was a nervous fool and was too distraught, that it was high time she stopped, and since the meal was finished, it was now time to serve tea.” At that very moment Amaliya Ivanovna, now absolutely offended that she had taken not the least part in the entire conversation, and that others weren’t even listening to her at all, suddenly risked a last attempt and, with secret anguish, ventured to make one extremely practical and profound remark to Katerina Ivanovna, about how in her future school it would be important to pay particular attention to the girls’ clean undergarments (die Wäsche) and that “she must haff one such good voman”—“die Dame”—“who the linen lookt after,” and, second, “that all ze girls must at night secretly no novels read.” Katerina Ivanovna, who was really distraught and very tired and already fed up with the funeral feast, immediately snapped at Amaliya Ivanovna and said that she was “talking nonsense” and didn’t understand a thing; that die Wäsche was the concern of the woman in charge of the linen, and not the director of a boarding school for noble young women; and as far as reading novels was concerned, that was simply indecent, and she asked her to keep quiet. Amaliya Ivanovna flushed; now angered , she remarked that “she visht ze best,” and that “she visht only ze very best,” and that Katerina “for ze apartment had yet to pay ze rent.” Katerina Ivanovna immediately “put her in her place,” saying that she was lying when she said that “she visht ze best,” because as recently as yesterday, when the deceased was still lying on the table, she had pestered her about the rent for the apartment. To this Amaliya Ivanovna replied extremely logically that “she invited zose ladies, but zose ladies didn’t come because zose ladies were respectable ladies und couldn’t disreputable ladies visit.” Katerina Ivanovna immediately “emphasized” to her that since she was a slut, she couldn’t judge what genuine nobility really was. Amaliya Ivanovna wouldn’t accept this and declared at once that her “Vater from Berlin vas a very, very important Mann and valked mit ze hends in ze pockets and always said, ‘Poof! Poof!’ ” and in order to represent her Vater more accurately, Amaliya Ivanovna jumped up from the chair, shoved both her hands into her pockets, puffed out her cheeks, and began making some sort of vague sounds with her mouth similar to puff, puff, to the accompaniment of loud guffaws from all the other lodgers, who intentionally encouraged Amaliya Ivanovna with their approval, expecting a fight. But Katerina Ivanovna could no longer stand it and rapidly, for all to hear, “blurted out” that perhaps Amaliya Ivanovna never even had a Vater, that Amaliya Ivanovna was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and that most likely she had worked somewhere as a cook before, perhaps even worse than that. Amaliya Ivanovna turned red as a lobster and shrieked that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna “had no Vater at all; that her Vater vas from Berlin, and he vore ze long frock coat und kept mit ze puff, puff, puff!” Katerina Ivanovna remarked with contempt that her own background was known to everyone and that the same certificate of merit indicated in print that her father was a colonel; while Amaliya Ivanovna’s father (if she even had one) was probably some poor Petersburg Finn who peddled milk; that most likely she didn’t have a father at all, because even up to now Amaliya Ivanovna’s patronymic was still unknown: Ivanovna or Lyudvigovna. Then Amaliya Ivanovna, furious at last, banging her fist on the table, took to shouting that she was Amal-Ivan, and not Lyu­dvigovna, that her Vater “vas called Johann und he vas ze Burgmeister,”† and that Katerina Ivanovna’s Vater “vas never ze Burgmeister.” Katerina Ivanovna stood up from her place and sternly, in an apparently calm voice (although she was completely pale and her chest was heaving deeply), remarked to her that if she dared “to compare for one moment her worthless Vater” with her own papa, that she, Katerina Ivanovna, “would tear off Amaliya’s cap and trample it underfoot.” After hearing this, Amaliya Ivanovna ran around the room, shouting with all her might that she was the landlady and that Katerina Ivanovna “must zis very minute vacate the apartment.” Then for some reason she rushed to collect her silver spoons from the table. An uproar and commotion ensued; the children began crying. Sonya hastened to restrain Katerina Ivanovna; but when Amaliya Ivanovna suddenly yelled something about a yellow ticket, Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonya away and went after Amaliya Ivanovna to carry out her threat about the cap immediately. At that very moment the door opened and Petr Petrovich Luzhin suddenly appeared on the threshold of the room. He stood regarding the entire company with a severe and attentive glance. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him. * Boiled rice with raisins and honey, traditionally eaten at a funeral repast.","Katerina Ivanovna had now cheered up, and launched straight away into a most detailed explanation of how she was going to use the pension that she was about to receive to set up a boarding school for young ladies in her home town of T——. * Raskolnikov had never heard of this boarding school from Katerina Ivanovna, and she instantly began expanding on all its most attractive details. Somehow or other she turned out to have in her hands that same ‘certificate of merit’ that Marmeladov himself had described to Raskolnikov, when they were in the drinking shop and he had told him how his wife Katerina Ivanovna, on leaving school, had danced the shawl dance ‘in the presence of the Governor and other personages’. This certificate was evidently now intended to demonstrate Katerina Ivanovna’s right to set up her own boarding school; but more importantly still, it had been kept in reserve as a final put-down to ‘those two tarted-up draggle-tails’, should they turn up to the wake, and as conclusive proof that Katerina Ivanovna came from ‘the most honourable, one might even say aristocratic home, that she was a colonel’s daughter, and undoubtedly superior to certain adventure-seekers of whom there were so many about these days’. The certificate of merit was immediately passed round the drunken guests, with Katerina Ivanovna doing nothing to prevent it, because it did indeed state en toutes lettres that she was the daughter of a Court Councillor with a civil decoration, and in consequence was really almost a colonel’s daughter. * Getting rather carried away, Katerina Ivanovna went on to describe in full detail the fine and tranquil life she would lead at T——, and mentioned the high-school teachers she would invite to give lessons at her establishment, and a certain respectable old Frenchman, Monsieur Mangot, who had taught French to Katerina Ivanovna herself when she was a schoolgirl, and who was still living out his days in T—— and would no doubt come and teach at her school at a most reasonable rate. Eventually her talk turned to Sonia too, ‘who would accompany Katerina Ivanovna to T—— and assist her in every way’. But at that someone snorted with laughter, and although Katerina Ivanovna tried to pretend that she scorned to notice the mirth that erupted at the far end of the table, she immediately raised her voice and started talking enthusiastically about Sofia Semionovna’s undoubted qualifications to serve as her assistant, and how ‘meek, long-suffering, selfless, noble and well-educated’ she was. And she patted Sonia on the cheek, and stood up to give her a couple of affectionate kisses. Sonia flushed, and Katerina Ivanovna suddenly burst into tears, telling herself that ‘she was a silly, nervous thing and much too upset, and it was time to finish; and since the meal was over it was time to pour the tea’. At that very moment Amalia Ivanovna, by now thoroughly offended at not having had the slightest part in this whole conversation, nor even been listened to, ventured on one last effort and allowed herself, despite secret misgivings, to risk imparting to Katerina Ivanovna a highly practical and well-considered suggestion: that in her future boarding school she would need to pay particular attention to the young ladies’ linen (die Wäsche) and ‘is absolute necessary there is one very good lady (die Dame) that is after the linen vell looking’, and furthermore, ‘that all young ladies in night-time not secretly any novel reading’. Katerina Ivanovna, who really was very tired and upset, and quite fed up with the wake by this time, instantly cut Amalia Ivanovna short and retorted that she was ‘talking a lot of rubbish’ and didn’t understand anything; that attending to die Wäsche was the housekeeper’s business and not that of the directress of a superior boarding school; and as for reading novels, the whole idea was most improper and would she kindly hold her tongue. Amalia Ivanovna fired up and venomously remarked that she ‘only wishing good’, and ‘always very much wishing good’, but that she ‘is for long time not paid das Geld for lodging’. Katerina Ivanovna instantly ‘put her down’ again, maintaining that her claim to be ‘wishing good’ was a lie, since only yesterday, with the dead man still laid out on the table, she had been badgering her for the rent. To this Amalia Ivanovna very logically replied that she ‘inviting those ladies, but those ladies not coming because those ladies respectable ladies are, and to unrespectable lady not can come’. Katerina Ivanovna forcefully pointed out to her that since she was a slut she couldn’t judge what true respectability meant. Amalia Ivanovna couldn’t put up with this and instantly announced that her ‘Vater aus Berlin is very, very important person and with both hands in pockets walking, and all the time so speaking: Puff! Puff!’ And in order to better portray her father, Amalia Ivanovna sprang up from her chair, shoved both hands in her pockets, blew out her cheeks, and began uttering indistinct noises that sounded like ‘puff-puff’; all the lodgers laughed loudly at this and tried to egg her on, in the hopes of a fight. Katerina Ivanovna could stand this no longer, and rapped out in everyone’s hearing that Amalia Ivanovna might well have never had a Vater at all, being nothing but a drunken Petersburg Finn who had very likely once served as someone ’s cook, if not worse. Amalia Ivanovna flushed red as a lobster and shrieked that it might be Katerina Ivanovna who ‘is never at all a Vater having’, but she herself had a ‘Vater aus Berlin who is such long frock-coat wearing and always making Puff! Puff! Puff!’ Katerina Ivanovna replied contemptuously that her own origins were known to all and that this very same certificate of merit stated in print that her father was a colonel; but that Amalia Ivanovna’s father (if indeed she had ever had one) had no doubt been some sort of Petersburg Finn and a milk merchant; even more likely, she had never had a father at all, since to this very day nobody knew what Amalia Ivanovna’s patronymic was—was she Ivanovna or Ludwigovna? * Amalia Ivanovna, now wild with fury, thumped her fist on the table and shrieked that she was ‘Amal-Ivan’ and not Ludwigovna, and her Vater ‘is Johann calling and he is Bürgermeister’, * and that Katerina Ivanovna’s Vater ‘is quite never a Bürgermeister being’. Katerina Ivanovna rose from her chair and remarked in a stern but seemingly calm voice (though she had turned very pale and her chest was heaving) that if she ever again dared ‘to mention her wretched little Vater in the same breath as her own Papenka, then she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear off her cap and stamp on it’. On hearing this, Amalia Ivanovna began running about the room shouting at the top of her voice that she was the mistress of the house and that Katerina Ivanovna was ‘in this minute from the flat leaving’; after which for some reason she rushed to retrieve her silver spoons from the table. Amid shouts and uproar, the children burst into tears. Sonia ran to try and restrain Katerina Ivanovna; but when Amalia Ivanovna suddenly yelled something about a yellow card, Katerina Ivanovna shoved Sonia aside and advanced on Amalia Ivanovna, meaning to carry out her threat about the cap on the spot. At that moment the door opened, and on the threshold appeared Piotr Petrovich Luzhin. He stood and surveyed the assembled company with a stern, piercing gaze. Katerina Ivanovna ran over to him.","Regaining her temper, Katerina Ivanovna began to tell Raskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to open a school for gentlemen’s daughters in her native town, T____. This was the first time she had spoken to him about the project, and she launched out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that Katerina Ivanovna had in her hands the same certificate of honour which Marmeladov had told Raskolnikov about in the tavern, when he told him that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance before the governor and other important people when she left school. This certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina Ivanovna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself with it chiefly with the purpose of overwhelming “those two stuck-up floozies” if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably that Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, “she might even say aristocratic family, a colonel’s daughter and was far superior to certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore recently.” The certificate of honor immediately passed into the hands of the drunken guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually contained the statement en toutes lettres48 that her father was a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really was almost the daughter of a colonel. Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and happy life they would lead in T____, on the gymnasium teachers whom she would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a highly respectable old Frenchman called Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna herself in the old days and was still living in T____, and would no doubt teach in her school on moderate terms. Next she spoke of Sonia who would go with her to T____ and help her in all her plans. At this someone at the further end of the table suddenly chuckled. Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of it, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of Sonia’s undoubted ability to assist her, of “her gentleness, patience, devotion, generosity and good education,” tapping Sonia on the cheek and kissing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was “nervous and silly, that she was too upset, that it was time to finish, and as the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea.” At that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved that she had played no part in the conversation and that no-one was listening to her, made one last effort, and with secret misgivings ventured on an extremely deep and weighty observation, that “in the future boarding-school she would have to pay particular attention to die Wasche, and that there certainly must be a good Dame to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies must not novels at night read.” Katerina Ivanovna, who was certainly upset and very tired, as well as heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying “she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the business of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class boarding-school to look after die Wasche, and as for novel reading, that was simply rude, and she begged her to be silent.” Amalia Ivanovna was enraged and observed that she only “meant her good,” and that “she had meant her very good,” and that “it was long since she had paid her gold for the lodgings.” Katerina Ivanovna at once put her down, saying that it was a lie to say she wished her good, because only yesterday, when her dead husband was lying on the table, she had bothered her about the lodgings. To this Amalia Ivanovna very appropriately retorted that she had invited those ladies, but “those ladies had not come, because those ladies are ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.” Katerina Ivanovna at once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge what made one really a lady. Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her “Vater aus Berlin was a very, very important man, and both hands in pockets went, and always used to say: poof! poof!” and she leapt up from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling “poof! poof!” amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who deliberately encouraged Amalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight. But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared, so all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a father, but was just a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once been a cook and probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned red as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a father, “but she had a Vater aus Berlin and that he wore a long coat and always said poof-poof-poof!” Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that everyone knew who her family was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print that her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna’s father—if she really had one—was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she never had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her name was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna. At this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist, and shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, “that her Vater was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that Katerina Ivanovna’s Vater was quite never a burgomeister.” Katerina Ivanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice (though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that “if she dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her head and trample it under foot.” Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room, shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table. There was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia ran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted something about “the yellow ticket,” Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia away, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat. At that minute the door opened, and Peter Petrovich Luzhin appeared on the threshold. He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant eyes. Katerina Ivanovna rushed towards him."

"Раскольникова мучило то, что этот бессмысленный бред так грустно и так мучительно отзывается в его воспоминаниях, что так долго не проходит впечатление этих горячешных грез. Шла уже вторая неделя после святой; стояли теплые, ясные, весенние дни; в арестантской палате отворили окна (решетчатые, под которыми ходил часовой). Соня, во все время болезни его, могла только два раза его навестить в палате; каждый раз надо было испрашивать разрешения, а это было трудно. Но она часто приходила на госпитальный двор, под окна, особенно под вечер, а иногда так только, чтобы постоять на дворе минутку и хоть издали посмотреть на окна палаты. Однажды, под вечер, уже совсем почти выздоровевший Раскольников заснул; проснувшись, он нечаянно подошел к окну и вдруг увидел вдали, у госпитальных ворот, Соню. Она стояла и как бы чего-то ждала. Что-то как бы пронзило в ту минуту его сердце; он вздрогнул и поскорее отошел от окна. В следующий день Соня не приходила, на третий день тоже; он заметил, что ждет ее с беспокойством. Наконец, его выписали. Придя в острог, он узнал от арестантов, что Софья Семеновна заболела, лежит дома и никуда не выходит.","Raskolnikov was tormented by the fact that this senseless delirium echoes so sadly and so painfully in his memoirs that the impression of these feverish dreams does not pass for so long. It was already the second week after the saint; it was warm, clear, spring days; windows were opened in the prisoner's ward (lattice windows, under which the sentry walked). Sonya, during the whole time of his illness, could only visit him twice in the ward; each time I had to ask permission, and it was difficult. But she often came to the hospital yard, under the windows, especially in the evening, and sometimes only so as to stand in the yard for a minute and at least look at the windows of the ward from a distance. One day, in the evening, Raskolnikov, who had almost recovered, fell asleep; waking up, he accidentally went to the window and suddenly saw in the distance, at the hospital gates, Sonya. She stood and seemed to be waiting for something. Something seemed to pierce his heart at that moment; he shuddered and hurried away from the window. Sonya did not come the next day, and neither did the third day; he noticed that he was waiting for her anxiously. Finally, he was released. Arriving at the prison, he learned from the prisoners that Sofya Semyonovna fell ill, was at home and did not go anywhere.","Raskolnikov was tormented by the fact that this senseless delirium lingered in his memory so sorrowfully and painfully, that the impact of these feverish fantasies was taking so long to fade. It was already the second week after Easter; the springlike days were warm and clear; the windows had been opened in the convicts’ ward (windows that were barred and guarded by a sentry). Sonya, all during his illness, was able to visit him in the ward only twice; each time she had to receive permission, and that was hard to obtain. But often she came to the hospital and stood under the windows, especially in the evening; sometimes it was only to stand there in the courtyard for a minute and glance from a distance at the windows of the ward. One evening, Raskolnikov, who had almost completely recovered, dozed off; when he awoke, he happened to approach the window and suddenly caught sight of Sonya in the distance, standing near the hospital gates. She stood there as if she were waiting for something. At that moment, something seemed to pierce his heart; he shuddered and quickly moved away from the window. The next day Sonya didn’t appear, nor did she the day after; he realized that he was waiting anxiously for her. At last they discharged him from the hospital. When he returned to the prison, he learned from the other convicts that Sofiya Semyonovna had fallen ill and was staying at home, unable to go anywhere.","Raskolnikov was distressed by the fact that this senseless fantasy had cast such a dark shadow on his memory, and that the impression of this feverish dream remained with him for such a long time. By now it was the second week after Easter, and the weather was warm, fine, and springlike. The windows of the prison ward were open (barred windows, with a sentry patrolling below). Through all his illness, Sonia had only been able to visit him in the ward on two occasions: she had to apply for permission each time, and that was difficult. But she would often come into the hospital courtyard beneath his window, especially in the evenings; sometimes she would simply stand there a minute or two, so as to catch just a glimpse of the windows of his ward in the distance. One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep, and on awakening he happened to go over to the window. Suddenly he caught sight of Sonia in the distance, standing by the hospital gates and apparently waiting for something. At that moment something seemed to pierce his heart. He shuddered and quickly walked away from the window. Next day Sonia didn’t come, nor the day after; and he realized that he was waiting anxiously for her. Finally he was discharged.

The second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel paced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during his illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was difficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially in the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the windows of the ward. One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. When he awoke he happened to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the distance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone. Something almost stabbed his heart at that moment. He shuddered and moved away from the window. The next day Sonia did not come, nor the day after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was discharged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that Sofia Semionovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out."

"Мысль эта иногда, даже во сне, мучила его, но в первый еще раз она явилась ему так сознательно ярко, как теперь, когда он шел к Свидригайлову. Одна уже мысль эта приводила его в мрачную ярость. Во-первых, тогда уже все изменится, даже в его собственном положении: следует тотчас же открыть тайну Дунечке. Следует, может быть, предать самого себя, чтоб отвлечь Дунечку от какого-нибудь неосторожного шага. Письмо? Нынче утром Дуня получила какое-то письмо! От кого в Петербурге могла бы она получать письма? (Лужин разве?) Правда, там стережет Разумихин; но Разумихин ничего не знает. Может быть, следует открыться и Разумихину? Раскольников с омерзением подумал об этом.","This thought sometimes, even in his sleep, tormented him, but for the first time it appeared to him as consciously and vividly as now, when he was going to Svidrigailov. The very thought of this alone made him furious. In the first place, then everything would change, even in his own position: Dunechka should immediately reveal the secret. Perhaps he should betray himself in order to distract Dounia from some careless step. Letter? Dunya received a letter this morning! From whom in Petersburg could she receive letters? (Is it Luzhin?) True, Razumikhin is guarding there; but Razumikhin knows nothing. Maybe Razumikhin should also open up? Raskolnikov thought about this with disgust.","Sometimes this idea tormented him even in his dreams; but now, as he made his way to Svidrigaylov’s, it was the first time the idea had so clearly appeared in his consciousness. This idea alone drove him into a dark rage. In the first place, everything would be changed, even his own situation: he would have to reveal his secret to Dunechka immediately. He might have to give himself up to save her from taking some careless step. The letter? This morning Dunya had received some sort of letter! Who in Petersburg could she be receiving letters from? (Could it be from Luzhin?) True, Razumikhin was standing guard; but he didn’t know anything. Perhaps he’d have to reveal himself to Razumikhin as well? Raskolnikov pondered all this with loathing.","This idea had tormented him from time to time, even in his dreams; but it had never entered his conscious mind so clearly as now, when he was on his way to Svidrigailov’s. The very thought drove him into a state of morose rage. In the first place, that would change everything at once, even his own personal situation. He would have to tell Dunechka his secret. Perhaps he would have to give himself up, just to save Dunechka from taking some rash step. A letter? This morning Dunia had received some letter, and who could be sending her letters, here in Petersburg? (Unless it was Luzhin?) Of course, Razumikhin was on guard there; but Razumikhin knew nothing. Perhaps he should tell Razumikhin everything? Raskolnikov recoiled from the very thought.","This idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it had never presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to Svidrigailov. Even the thought of it moved him to gloomy rage. To begin with, this would transform everything, even his own position; he would have to confess his secret at once to Dunia. Would he have to give himself up, perhaps, to prevent Dunia from taking some rash step? The letter? This morning Dunia had received a letter. From whom could she get letters in Petersburg? Luzhin, perhaps? It’s true Razumikhin was there to protect her, but Razumikhin knew nothing of her position. Perhaps it was his duty to tell Razumikhin? The thought of it repulsed him."

"– Я не знаю этого, – сухо ответила Дуня, – я слышала только какую-то очень странную историю, что этот Филипп был какой-то ипохондрик, какой-то домашний философ, люди говорили, «зачитался», и что удавился он более от насмешек, а не от побой господина Свидригайлова.

And he treated people well in my presence, and people even loved him, although they really also blamed him for the death of Philip.","“I don’t know that for certain,” Dunya replied drily. “I’ve heard only a very strange tale that this Filipp was some sort of hypochondriac, a kind of homespun philosopher; people said that he ‘read himself silly,’ and that he hanged himself more as a result of taunts, and not as a result of Mr. Svidrigaylov’s beatings. In my presence, he treated other people well; the serfs even loved him, although they also accused him of Filipp’s death.”","‘I don’t know about that,’ replied Dunia shortly. ‘All I heard was a very odd story about how this Philip was some sort of hypochondriac, a kind of home-grown philosopher—people said he had “read himself crazy”*—and that he hanged himself chiefly because Mr Svidrigailov made fun of him, not because he beat him.

When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for Philip’s death.”"
"– Нет уж, брат Родя, не противься, потом поздно будет; да и я всю ночь не засну, потому без мерки, наугад покупал. Как раз! – воскликнул он торжественно, примерив, – как раз по мерке!

Толстяков, мой приятель, каждый раз принужден снимать свою покрышку, входя куда-нибудь в общее место, где все другие в шляпах и фуражках стоят.

Ну-с, Настенька, вот вам два головные убора: сей пальмерстон (он достал из угла исковерканную круглую шляпу Раскольникова, которую, неизвестно почему, назвал пальмерстоном) или сия ювелирская вещица?

Tolstyakov, my friend, every time is forced to take off his tire, entering somewhere in a common place where all the others are standing in hats and caps. Everyone thinks that he is from slavish feelings, but he is simply because he is ashamed of his bird's nest: such a bashful person! Well, Nastenka, here are two hats for you: this palmerston (he took out of the corner Raskolnikov's warped round hat, which, for some unknown reason, he called palmerston) or this piece of jewelry?

Well, Nastenka, here are two different hats: this Palmerston”§—he retrieved from the corner Raskolnikov’s mangled round top hat, which, for some reason, he called a Palmerston—“and this splendid item. Take a guess, Rodya; how much do you think I paid for it?

Just right!’ he exclaimed triumphantly when he had tried it on his friend; ‘exactly the right size! Your headgear is the first and most important part of your outfit, it acts as a sort of introduction. My friend Tolstyakov has to take his lid off every time he goes into a public place where everyone else is standing around in hats and caps. They all think he’s servile, but he’s just ashamed of his bird’s nest. Such a bashful fellow! Well now, Nastenka, here you have two items of headgear: this Palmerston (and he picked up Raskolnikov’s crumpled round hat from the corner ; no one knew why he called it a Palmerston*), or this jeweller’s article? Put a price on it, Rodia, guess how much I paid for it? Nastasyushka?’ he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov said nothing.","“Come on, Rodia, don’t oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and I shan’t sleep all night, because I guessed your size without measuring it. Just right!” he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, “just your size! A proper head-covering is the most important item of clothing and a recommendation in its own way. Tolstiakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other people wear their hats or caps. People think he does it out of slavish politeness, but it’s simply because he’s ashamed of his bird’s nest; he gets embarrassed so easily! Look, Nastasia, here are two specimens of headgear: this Palmerston”22—he took from the corner Raskolnikov’s old, battered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston—“or this jewel!

In my personal opinion, if you like, even something has been done: new, useful thoughts have been circulated, some new, useful works have been circulated, instead of the old dreamy and romantic ones; literature takes on a more mature connotation; many harmful prejudices have been eradicated and ridiculed ... In a word, we irrevocably cut ourselves off from the past, and this, in my opinion, is really the case ...","“I don’t agree with you,” Petr Petrovich objected with visible pleasure. “Of course, there are enthusiasms, inaccuracies, but one must be indulgent: enthusiasms bear witness to their fervor for action and to incorrect external circumstances in which the matter is placed. If little has been achieved, it’s because there’s been so little time. I’m not even referring to the means. In my personal view, if you like, one can even say that something has been achieved: new, useful ideas have been widely circulated, several new, useful works have been disseminated in place of the previous fantastic and romantic ones. Literature has acquired a more mature outlook, and many harmful prejudices have been rooted out and ridiculed. . . . In a word, we’ve cut ourselves off once and for all from the past, and in my opinion, that’s already an achievement, sir . . .”","‘I cannot agree with you,’ responded Piotr Petrovich with evident relish. ‘Of course people can get carried away and make mistakes, but you have to be tolerant of them—it all comes about through their enthusiasm for the matter in hand and the unfavourable circumstances surrounding it. And though not much may have been achieved, there has not been much time either. Not to mention the lack of resources. In my personal opinion, if I may say so, something has indeed been achieved; new and valuable ideas have been propagated, a number of new and valuable works have been published, in place of the old dreamy, romantic ones; literature is adopting a more mature outlook; many injurious prejudices have been rooted out and held up to ridicule… In a word, we have cut ourselves free from the past, once and for all, and in my view that is an important achievement.’","Practicality has to have some kind of experience behind it.” “I don’t agree with you,” Peter Petrovich replied, with evident enjoyment. “Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes, but you must be indulgent of that; those mistakes are merely evidence of enthusiasm for the cause and of an abnormal external environment. If little has been done, then there hasn’t been the time, let alone the means. It’s my personal view, if you would like to know, that something has been accomplished already. New and valuable ideas, new and valuable works are circulating instead of our dreamy old romantic authors. Literature is taking on a more mature form, many unjust prejudices have been rooted up and turned into ridicule ... In a word, we have cut ourselves off irreversibly from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great thing . . . ”"

"Не то чтоб он был так труслив и забит, совсем даже напротив; но с некоторого времени он был в раздражительном и напряженном состоянии, похожем на ипохондрию. Он до того углубился в себя и уединился от всех, что боялся даже всякой встречи, не только встречи с хозяйкой. Он был задавлен бедностью; но даже стесненное положение перестало в последнее время тяготить его. Насущными делами своими он совсем перестал и не хотел заниматься. Никакой хозяйки, в сущности, он не боялся, что бы та ни замышляла против него. Но останавливаться на лестнице, слушать всякий вздор про всю эту обыденную дребедень, до которой ему нет никакого дела, все эти приставания о платеже, угрозы, жалобы, и при этом самому изворачиваться, извиняться, лгать, – нет уж, лучше проскользнуть как-нибудь кошкой по лестнице и улизнуть, чтобы никто не видал.","Not that he was so cowardly and downtrodden, quite the opposite; but for some time he was in an irritable and tense state, similar to hypochondria.

In fact, he was not afraid of any mistress, no matter what she planned against him. But to stop on the stairs, to listen to all the nonsense about all this ordinary rubbish, to which he has nothing to do, all this harassment about payment, threats, complaints, and at the same time dodge, apologize, lie, - no, it’s better to slip through somehow. cat up the stairs and sneak away so no one can see.","It wasn’t that he was so fearful and cowed; in fact, it was just the opposite; but for some time he had been in an irritable and anxious state, similar to hypochondria.

He was crushed by poverty, but even his constrained circumstances had ceased to burden him of late. He had completely stopped handling his own everyday affairs and didn’t wish to deal with them.

"Эти шаги послышались очень далеко, еще в самом начале лестницы, но он очень хорошо и отчетливо помнил, что с первого же звука, тогда же стал подозревать почему-то, что это непременно сюда, в четвертый этаж, к старухе. Почему? Звуки, что ли, были такие особенные, знаменательные? Шаги были тяжелые, ровные, неспешные. Вот уж он прошел первый этаж, вот поднялся еще; все слышней и слышней! Послышалась тяжелая одышка входившего. Вот уж и третий начался… Сюда! И вдруг показалось ему, что он точно окостенел, что это точно во сне, когда снится, что догоняют, близко, убить хотят, а сам точно прирос к месту и руками пошевелить нельзя.","These steps were heard very far away, even at the very beginning of the staircase, but he remembered very well and clearly that from the very first sound, then for some reason he began to suspect that it would certainly be here, on the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Sounds, or what, were so special, significant? The steps were heavy, even, unhurried. Now he has passed the first floor, now he has risen yet; more and more audible! I heard a severe shortness of breath entering. And the third has already begun ... This way! And suddenly it seemed to him that he was as if ossified, that it was as if in a dream, when he was dreaming that they were catching up, close, they wanted to kill, but he himself seemed to be rooted to the place and he could not move his hands.","The steps were very far off, at the bottom of the stairs, but he later recalled very clearly and distinctly that from the first sound, for some reason or other, he began to suspect that the footsteps were definitely coming here, that is, up to the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds so special, so noteworthy, or what? The steps were heavy, even, unhurried. Now he had passed the first floor and kept on climbing; the steps were becoming more and more audible! He could hear a man’s serious shortness of breath. He was approaching the third floor. . . . He was coming here! All of a sudden Raskolnikov felt paralyzed, as if he were asleep, dreaming that he was being chased; they were getting closer, wanting to kill him, while he was rooted to the spot and unable even to move his arms.","These footsteps sounded very far down, right at the bottom of the staircase, but he later remembered very clearly and distinctly that at the very first sound of them, he immediately suspected for some reason that they were coming precisely here, to the fourth floor, to the old woman’s flat. Why? Was it the sounds themselves that were so peculiar and significant? The steps were heavy, even, and unhurried. Now he had passed the first floor, now he had come higher still; his steps were getting louder and louder! Raskolnikov could hear the man’s heavy breathing as he climbed. Now he had started up the third flight… He’s coming here! And suddenly Raskolnikov felt himself turned to stone, as in one of those dreams where someone is chasing you, coming close behind you, wanting to kill you, and you’re rooted to the spot and can’t even move your hands.","The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming there, to the fourth floor, to the old woman.

He could hear his heavy breathing. And now the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to him all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is rooted to the spot and cannot even move one’s arms."
"– Как! Вы здесь? – начал он с недоумением и таким тоном, как бы век был знаком, – а мне вчера еще говорил Разумихин, что вы все не в памяти. Вот странно! А ведь я был у вас…","- How! Are you here? he began in bewilderment and in such a tone as if the century had been familiar, “and Razumikhin told me yesterday that you are all out of memory. That's strange! But I was with you...","“So! You’re here?” he began in a puzzled voice, with a tone as if they’d known each other forever. “Razumikhin told me only yesterday that you were still delirious. How strange! I came by to see you, you know . . .”","‘What’s all this? You here?’ he began in astonishment, speaking as if they’d known each other all their lives. ‘ Razumikhin was telling me only yesterday that you were unconscious. Isn’t that odd!

"– Лизавету-то тоже убили! – брякнула вдруг Настасья, обращаясь к Раскольникову. Она все время оставалась в комнате, прижавшись подле двери, и слушала.","- Lizaveta was killed too! - suddenly blurted out Nastasya, referring to Raskolnikov. She stayed in the room all the time, huddled near the door, and listened.","“They also killed Lizaveta!” Nastasya blurted out suddenly, turning to Raskolnikov.

"Раскольников тут уже прошел и не слыхал больше. Он проходил тихо, незаметно, стараясь не проронить ни единого слова.

Он узнал, он вдруг, внезапно и совершенно неожиданно узнал, что завтра, ровно в семь часов вечера, Лизаветы, старухиной сестры и единственной ее сожительницы, дома не будет и что, стало быть, старуха, ровно в семь часов вечера, останется дома одна.","Raskolnikov had already passed by and did not hear any more.

"– Нету, Родя. Очень часто ее дома не вижу, оставляет меня одну. Дмитрий Прокофьич, спасибо ему, заходит со мной посидеть и все об тебе говорит. Любит он тебя и уважает, мой друг. Про сестру же не говорю, чтоб она уж так очень была ко мне непочтительна. Я ведь не жалуюсь. У ней свой характер, у меня свой; у ней свои тайны какие-то завелись; ну, у меня тайн от вас нет никаких. Конечно, я твердо уверена, что Дуня слишком умна и, кроме того, и меня и тебя любит… но уж не знаю, к чему все это приведет. Вот ты меня осчастливил теперь, Родя, что зашел, а она-то вот и прогуляла; придет, я и скажу; а без тебя брат был, а ты где изволила время проводить? Ты меня, Родя, очень-то и не балуй: можно тебе – зайди, нельзя – нечего делать, и так подожду. Ведь я все-таки буду знать, что ты меня любишь, с меня и того довольно.

То есть как это он сочинился у нас, скажите пожалуйста! Город канцеляристов и всевозможных семинаристов!
