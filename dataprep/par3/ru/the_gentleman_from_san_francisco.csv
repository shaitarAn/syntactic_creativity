"«Что, что случилось?» – и никто не отвечал толком, никто не понимал ничего, так как люди и до сих пор еще больше всего дивятся и ни за что не хотят верить смерти. Хозяин метался от одного гостя к другому, пытаясь задержать бегущих и успокоить их поспешными заверениями, что это так, пустяк, маленький обморок с одним господином из Сан-Франциско… Но никто его не слушал, многие видели, как лакеи и коридорные срывали с этого господина галстук, жилет, измятый смокинг и даже зачем-то бальные башмаки с черных шелковых ног с плоскими ступнями. А он еще бился. Он настойчиво боролся со смертью, ни за что не хотел поддаться ей, так. Неожиданно и грубо навалившейся на него. Он мотал головой, хрипел, как зарезанный, закатил глаза, как пьяный… Когда его торопливо внесли и положили на кровать в сорок третий номер, – самый маленький, самый плохой, самый сырой и холодный, в конце нижнего коридора, – прибежала его дочь, с распущенными волосами, в распахнувшемся капотике, с обнаженной грудью, поднятой корсетом, потом большая, тяжелая и уже совсем наряженная к обеду жена, у которой рот был круглый от ужаса… Но тут он уже и головой перестал мотать.","""What? What happened?"" - and no one answered plainly, no one understood anything, because people still marvel even more than anything and do not want to believe in death for anything. The host rushed about from one guest to another, trying to stop the fugitives and calm them down with hasty assurances that this was so, a trifle, a small swoon with one gentleman from San Francisco ... But no one listened to him, many saw how lackeys and bellboys tore off this gentleman tie, waistcoat, crumpled tuxedo, and even for some reason ballroom shoes with black silk legs with flat feet. And he still fought. He persistently struggled with death, never wanted to succumb to it, right. Suddenly and rudely fell on him. He shook his head, wheezed, as if stabbed to death, rolled his eyes like a drunk ... When he was hurriedly carried in and laid on the bed in room forty-three - the smallest, worst, dampest and coldest, at the end of the lower corridor - his daughter came running, with her hair loose, in a bonnet open, with a bare chest raised by a corset, then a big, heavy wife, already completely dressed up for dinner, whose mouth was round with horror ... But then he stopped shaking his head.","Many sprang up from the table, upsetting their chairs, many, pallid, ran towards the reading-room, and in every language it was asked: ""What--what's the matter? "" None answered intelligibly, nobody understood, for even to-day people are more surprised at death than at anything else, and never want to believe it is true. The proprietor rushed from one guest to another, trying to keep back those who were hastening up, to soothe them with assurances that it was a mere trifle, a fainting-fit that had overcome a certain Gentleman from San Francisco.... But no one heeded him. Many saw how the porters and waiters were tearing off the tie, waistcoat, and crumpled dress-coat from that same gentleman, even, for some reason or other, pulling off his patent evening-shoes from his black-silk, flat-footed feet. And he was still writhing. He continued to struggle with death, by no means wanting to yield to that which had so unexpectedly and rudely overtaken him. He rolled his head, rattled like one throttled, and turned up the whites of his eyes as if he were drunk. When he had been hastily carried into room No. 43, the smallest, wretchedest, dampest, and coldest room at the end of the bottom corridor, his daughter came running with her hair all loose, her dressing-gown flying open, showing her bosom raised by her corsets: then his wife, large and heavy and completely dressed for dinner, her mouth opened round with terror. But by that time he had already ceased rolling his head.","What, what’s happened?’ was heard in every language – and no one could give an intelligible answer, no one understood anything, because even today people still marvel above all else at death and refuse to accept it. The proprietor rushed from one visitor to another, trying to restrain those who were running and calm them with hasty assurances that it was nothing, just a fainting fit that had overcome a certain gentleman from San Francisco. But no one listened to him, many of them had seen the footmen and boots tearing off the gentleman’s tie, waistcoat, crumpled dinner-jacket and even for some reason the evening shoes from those black silk feet with the flat soles. And he was still fighting. He was tenaciously struggling with death, by no means willing to give in to the enemy that had so unexpectedly and crudely fallen upon him. He shook his head, wheezed like a stuck pig and rolled his eyes as if drunk … He was hurriedly carried off and laid on the bed in room 43, the smallest, nastiest, dampest and coldest room in the hotel, at the end of the bottom corridor; his daughter rushed in with her hair lose and her half-bare bosom propped up by her corset, followed by his large wife, dressed up for dinner, her mouth round with horror … But by then he had already stopped shaking his head.","What has happened?"" And no one was able to answer it clearly, no oneunderstood anything, for until this very day men still wonder most at death and most absolutely refuse to believe in it. The owner rushed from one guest to another, trying to keep back those who were running and soothe them with hasty assurances, that this was nothing, a mere trifle, a little fainting-spell by which a Gentleman from San Francisco had been overcome. But no one listened to him, many saw how the footmen and waiters tore from the gentleman his tie, collar, waistcoat, the rumpled evening coat, and even —— for no visible reason —— the dancing shoes from his black silk-covered feet. And he kept on writhing. He obstinately struggled with death, he did not want to yield to the foe that attacked him so unexpectedly and grossly. He shook his head, emitted rattling sounds like one throttled, and turned up his eye-balls like one drunk with wine. When he was hastily brought into Number Forty-three, —— the smallest, worst, dampest, and coldest room at the end of the lower corridor, —— and stretched on the bed, —— his daughter came running, her hair falling over her shoulders, the skirts of her dressing-gown thrown open, with bare breasts raised by the corset. Then came his wife, big, heavy, almost completely dressed for dinner, her mouth round with terror."
"И опять, опять пошел корабль в свой далекий морской путь. Ночью плыл он мимо острова Капри, и печальны были его огни, медленно скрывавшиеся в темном море, для того, кто смотрел на них с острова Но там, на корабле, в светлых, сияющих люстрами и мрамором залах, был, как обычно, людный бал в эту ночь.","And again, again, the ship went on its distant sea route. At night he sailed past the island of Capri, and his lights, slowly hiding in the dark sea, were sad for those who looked at them from the island. But there, on the ship, in bright halls shining with chandeliers and marble, there was, as usual, a crowded ball this night.","And again, again the ship set out on the long voyage. She passed at night near Capri, and to those who were looking out from the island, sad seemed the lights of the ship slowly hiding themselves in the sea's darkness. But there aboard the liner, in the bright halls shining with lights and marble, gay dancing filled the evening, as usual....","And again, once again, the ship set off on its long voyage. It was night when it sailed past the island of Capri, and to those who were looking out from that shore its lights seemed sad as they gradually faded into the dark sea. But on board in the bright, chandelier-lit state-rooms there was, as usual, a crowded ball that night.","And again did the ship set out on its far sea journey. At night it sailed by the island of Capri, and, for those who watched it from the island, its lights slowly disappearing in the dark sea, it seemed infinitely sad. But there, on the vast steamer, in its lighted halls shining with brilliance and marble, a noisy dancing party was going on, as usual."
"– О, это ужасно! – пробормотал он, опуская крепкую лысую голову и не стараясь понять, не думая, что именно ужасно, потом привычно и внимательно оглядел свои короткие, с подагрическими затвердениями на суставах пальцы, их крупные и выпуклые ногти миндального цвета и повторил с убеждением: – Это ужасно…","- Oh, it's terrible! - he muttered, lowering his strong bald head and not trying to understand, not thinking what exactly was terrible, then habitually and attentively looked at his short fingers, with arthritic hardening on the joints, their large and protruding almond-colored nails and repeated with conviction: - This is terrible …","""It is awful!"" he muttered, dropping his strong, bald head, but without trying to understand or to know what was awful. Then, with habitual careful attention examining his gouty-jointed short fingers and large, convex, almond-shaped finger-nails, he repeated: ""It is awful....""","‘God, this is dreadful!’ he muttered, dropping his strong bald head, but not trying to work out or even think about what exactly was so dreadful; then, as was his habit, he inspected his stubby fingers with their gout-stiffened joints and their big, bulging, almond-coloured nails and repeated with certainty: ‘This is dreadful!’","""It's terrible!"" he muttered, lowering his strong, bald head and making no effort to understand what was terrible; then, with a careful and habitual gesture, he examined his short fingers with gouty callosities in the joints, and their large, convex, almond-colored nails, and repeated with conviction, ""It's terrible!"""
"Мисс была ужасно бледна и держала в зубах ломтик лимона. Мистер, лежавший на спине, в широком пальто и большом картузе, не разжимал челюстей всю дорогу; лицо его стало темным, усы белыми, голова тяжко болела: последние дни благодаря дурной погоде он пил по вечерам слишком много и слишком много любовался «живыми картинами» в некоторых притонах. А дождь сек в дребезжащие стекла, на диваны с них текло, ветер с воем ломил в мачты и порою, вместе с налетавшей волной, клал пароходик совсем набок, и тогда с грохотом катилось что-то внизу. На остановках, в Кастелламаре, в Сорренто, было немного легче; но и тут размахивало страшно, берег со всеми своими обрывами, садами, пиниями, розовыми и белыми отелями и дымными, курчаво-зелеными горами летел за окном вниз и вверх, как на качелях; в стены стукались лодки, третьеклассники азартно орали, где-то, точно раздавленный, давился криком ребенок, сырой ветер дул в двери, и, ни на минуту не смолкая, пронзительно вопил с качавшейся барки под флагом гостиницы «Royal» картавый мальчишка, заманивавший путешественников: «Kgoya-al! Hotel Kgoya-аl!..» И господин из Сан-Франциско, чувствуя себя так, как и подобало ему, – совсем стариком, – уже с тоской и злобой думал обо всех этих «Royal», «Splendid», «Excelsior» и об этих жадных, воняющих чесноком людишках, называемых итальянцами; раз во время остановки, открыв глаза и приподнявшись с дивана, он увидел под скалистым отвесом кучу таких жалких, насквозь проплесневевших каменных домишек, налепленных друг на друга у самой воды, возле лодок, возле каких-то тряпок, жестянок и коричневых сетей, что, вспомнив, что это и есть подлинная Италия, которой он приехал наслаждаться, почувствовал отчаяние… Наконец, уже в сумерках, стал надвигаться своей чернотой остров, точно насквозь просверленный у подножия красными огоньками, ветер стал мягче, теплей, благовонней, по смиряющимся волнам, переливавшимся, как черное масло, потекли золотые удавы от фонарей пристани… Потом вдруг загремел и с плеском шлепнулся в воду якорь, наперебой понеслись отовсюду яростные крики лодочников – и сразу стало на душе легче, ярче засияла кают – компания, захотелось есть, пить, курить, двигаться… Через десять минут семья из Сан-Франциско сошла в большую барку, через пятнадцать ступила на камни набережной, а затем села в светлый вагончик и с жужжанием потянулась вверх по откосу, среди кольев на виноградниках, полуразвалившихся каменных оград и мокрых, корявых, прикрытых кое-где соломенными навесами апельсиновых деревьев, с блеском оранжевых плодов и толстой глянцевитой листвы скользивших вниз, под гору, мимо открытых окон вагончика… Сладко пахнет в Италии земля после дождя, и свой, особый запах есть у каждого ее острова!","Miss was terribly pale and held a slice of lemon in her teeth. The mister, who was lying on his back, in a wide coat and a large cap, did not open his jaws all the way; his face became dark, his mustache white, his head ached severely: the last days, thanks to bad weather, he drank too much in the evenings and admired too much ""living pictures"" in some brothels. And the rain fell on the rattling glass, it flowed from them on the sofas, the wind howled at the masts and sometimes, together with the oncoming wave, laid the steamer completely on its side, and then something rolled down with a roar. At the stops, at Castellammare, at Sorrento, it was a little easier; but even here it waved terribly, the coast with all its cliffs, gardens, pines, pink and white hotels and smoky, curly-green mountains flew up and down outside the window, as on a swing; Boats banged against the walls, third-graders screamed excitedly, somewhere, as if crushed, a child was choking on a cry, a damp wind blew at the doors, and, not ceasing for a minute, piercingly screamed from a rocking barge under the flag of the Royal Hotel, a burry boy who lured travelers : ""Kgoya-al! Hotel Kgoya-al!..” And the gentleman from San Francisco, feeling as he should, a very old man, was already thinking about all these “Royal”, “Splendid”, “Excelsior” and about those greedy, garlic-smelling little people called Italians; once during a stop, opening his eyes and rising from the sofa, he saw under a rocky sheer a bunch of such miserable, moldy stone houses stuck to each other near the water, near the boats, near some rags, tins and brown nets, that, remembering that this was the real Italy that he had come to enjoy, he felt despair... Finally, already at dusk, the island began to move in its blackness, as if drilled through with red lights at the foot, the wind became softer, warmer, more fragrant, like black oil, golden boas flowed from the lanterns of the pier ... Then suddenly an anchor thundered and splashed into the water, furious cries of boatmen rushed from everywhere - and immediately it became easier on the soul, the cabins shone brighter - the company, I wanted to eat, drink, smoke, move ... Ten minutes later, the family from San Francisco got into a large barge, after fifteen they stepped on the stones of the embankment, and then got into a bright trailer and, with a buzzing m stretched up the slope, among the stakes in the vineyards, dilapidated stone fences and wet, gnarled, covered in some places with thatched canopies of orange trees, with a gleam of orange fruits and thick glossy foliage sliding downhill, past the open windows of the trailer ... It smells sweet in Italy is the land after the rain, and each of its islands has its own special smell!","The younger lady from San Francisco was deathly pale, and held in her teeth a slice of lemon. Now not even the thought of meeting the prince at Sorrento, where he was due to arrive by Christmas, could gladden her. The gentleman lay flat on his back, in a broad overcoat and a flat cap, and did not loosen his jaws throughout the voyage. His face grew dark, his moustache white, his head ached furiously. For the last few days, owing to the bad weather, he had been drinking heavily, and had more than once admired the ""tableaux vivants. "" The rain whipped on the rattling window-panes, under which water dripped on to the sofas, the wind beat the masts with a howl, and at moments, aided by an onrushing wave, laid the little steamer right on its side, whereupon something would roll noisily away below. At the stopping places, Castellamare, Sorrento, things were a little better. But even the ship heaved frightfully, and the coast with all its precipices, gardens, pines, pink and white hotels, and hazy, curly green mountains swooped past the window, up and down, as it were on swings. The boats bumped against the side of the ship, the sailors and passengers shouted lustily, and somewhere a child, as if crushed to death, choked itself with screaming. The damp wind blew through the doors, and outside on the sea, from a reeling boat which showed the flag of the Hotel Royal, a fellow with guttural French exaggeration yelled unceasingly: ""Rrroy-al! Hotel Rrroy-al!"" intending to lure passengers aboard his craft. Then the Gentleman from San Francisco, feeling, as he ought to have felt, quite an old man, thought with anguish and spite of all these ""Royals,"" ""Splendids,"" ""Excelsiors,"" and of these greedy, good-for-nothing, garlic-stinking fellows called Italians. Once, during a halt, on opening his eyes and rising from the sofa he saw under the rocky cliff-curtain of the coast a heap of such miserable stone hovels, all musty and mouldy, stuck on top of one another by the very water, among the boats, and the rags of all sorts, tin cans and brown fishing-nets, and, remembering that this was the very Italy he had come to enjoy, he was seized with despair.... At last, in the twilight, the black mass of the island began to loom nearer, looking as if it were bored through at the base with little red lights. The wind grew softer, warmer, more sweet-smelling. Over the tamed waves, undulating like black oil, there came flowing golden boa-constrictors of light from the lanterns of the harbour.... Then suddenly the anchor rumbled and fell with a splash into the water. Furious cries of the boatmen shouting against one another came from all directions. And relief was felt at once. The electric light of the cabin shone brighter, and a desire to eat, drink, smoke, move once more made itself felt.... Ten minutes later the family from San Francisco disembarked into a large boat; in a quarter of an hour they had stepped on to the stones of the quay, and were soon seated in the bright little car of the funicular railway. With a buzz they were ascending the slope, past the stakes of the vineyards and wet, sturdy orange-trees, here and there protected by straw screens, past the thick glossy foliage and the brilliancy of orange fruits.... Sweetly smells the earth in Italy after rain, and each of her islands has its own peculiar aroma.","The daughter was dreadfully pale and held a slice of lemon between her teeth. The gentleman himself, lying on his back in a full overcoat and a wide peaked cap, kept his teeth clenched the whole way; his face grew dark, his moustache turned white and he had a severe headache; during the previous few days the bad weather had led him to drink heavily in the evenings and feast his eyes on too many tableaux vivants in various nightclubs. And the rain beat against the shuddering glass panes and dripped onto the divans, the howling wind rushed against the masts and from time to time, with the help of a swooping wave, turned the little steamer almost onto her side, and every time she did so something rolled about down below with a clanging noise. It was slightly calmer at the two stopping-places, Castellammare and Sorrento, but there too the tossing was frightful, so that the shore, with all its ravines and gardens, pine trees, pink and white hotels and smoky, crisp-green mountains, appeared to rise and fall as if on a seesaw; boats banged against the sides of the steamer, the moist wind blew through the doorway and a guttural-voiced boy on a rocking barge with a pennant proclaiming Hotel Royal yelled ceaselessly, trying to entice travellers onto his boat. And the gentleman from San Francisco, feeling – as well he might – a thoroughly old man, was already thinking anguished and malicious thoughts about all those grasping and garlicky little people whom the world called Italians; opening his eyes during one of the stops and sitting up on the divan, he caught sight of a huddle of such wretched, mould-encrusted stone houses under a rocky slope, stuck together right at the water’s edge among a clutter of boats, rags, tins and brown nets, that, remembering this was the real Italy which he had come to enjoy, he was seized with despair … At last, when it was already dusk, the dark mass of the island loomed up, seemingly pitted with red lights at its base; the wind grew softer, warmer and more fragrant, and golden snakes of light from the lamps on the jetty came shooting across the waves which were rippling like black oil. Then suddenly the anchor clattered and plopped heavily into the water, and the frenzied vying shouts of the boatmen echoed around. Relief was felt at once, the lights in the saloon seemed to shine more brightly and everyone wanted to eat, drink, smoke and move about. Ten minutes later the family from San Francisco stepped down into a big wooden barge, and in another five they climbed onto the stone quay and entered a brightly-coloured little cable car which with a humming noise glided up the hillside through fields of vine-stakes, dilapidated walls and gnarled, damp orange trees, protected here and there by straw canopies, which all slipped back downhill, with their gleaming fruit and thick, lustrous foliage, past the open windows of the little compartment … The earth of Italy smells sweet after rain, and each Italian island has its own peculiar aroma.","The lady's daughter was frightfully pale and kept a slice of lemon between her teeth. Not even the hope of an unexpected meeting with the prince at Sorrento, where he planned to arrive on Christmas, served to cheer her. The Gentleman from San Francisco, who was lying on his back, dressed in a large overcoat and a big cap, did not loosen his jaws throughout the voyage. His face grew dark, his moustache white, and his head ached heavily; for the last few days, because of the bad weather, he had drunk far too much in the evenings. And the rain kept on beating against the rattling window panes, and water dripped down from them on the sofas; the howling wind attacked the masts, and sometimes, aided by a heavy sea, it laid the little steamer on its side, and then something below rolled about with a rattle. While the steamer was anchored at Castellamare and Sorrento, the situation was more cheerful; but even here the ship rolled terribly, and the coast with all its precipices, gardens and pines, with its pink and white hotels and hazy mountains clad in curling verdure, flew up and down as if it were on swings. The rowboats hit against the sides of the steamer, the sailors and the deck passengers shouted at the top of their voices, and somewhere a baby screamed as if it were being crushed to pieces. A wet wind blew through the door, and from a wavering barge flying the flag of the Hotel Royal, an urchin kept on unwearyingly shouting ""Kgoyal-al! Hotel Kgoyal-al! . . . "" inviting tourists. And the Gentleman from San Francisco felt like the old man that he was, —— and it was with weariness and animosity that he thought of all these""Royals,"" ""Splendids,"" ""Excelsiors,"" and of all those greedy bugs, reeking with garlic, who are called Italians. Once, during a stop, having opened his eyes and half-risen from the sofa, he noticed in the shadow of the rock beach a heap of stone huts, miserable, mildewed through and through, huddled close by the water, near boats, rags, tin-boxes, and brown fishing nets, —— and as he remembered that this was the very Italy he had come to enjoy, he felt a great despair . . . Finally, in twilight, the black mass of the island began to grow nearer, as though burrowed through at the base by red fires, the wind grew softer, warmer, more fragrant; from the dock-lanterns huge golden serpents flowed down the tame waves which undulated like black oil . . . Then, suddenly, the anchor rumbled and fell with a splash into the water, the fierce yells of the boatman filled the air, —— and at once everyone's heart grew easy. The electric lights in the cabin grew more brilliant, and there came a desire to eat, drink, smoke, move . . . Ten minutes later the family from San Francisco found themselves in a large ferry-boat; fifteen minutes later they trod the stones of the quay, and then seated themselves in a small lighted car, which, with a buzz, started to ascend the slope, while vineyard stakes, half-ruined stone fences, and wet, crooked lemon-trees, in spots shielded by straw sheds, with their glimmering orange-colored fruit and thick glossy foliage, were sliding down past the open car windows. . . After rain, the earth smells sweetly in Italy, and each of her islands has a fragrance of its own."
"И помедлив, что-то подумав, но ничего не сказав, господин из Сан-Франциско отпустил его кивком головы.","And after a pause, after thinking something, but without saying anything, the gentleman from San Francisco dismissed him with a nod of his head.","The Gentleman from San Francisco was silent for a while, thinking of something, but saying nothing; then he dismissed the man with a nod of the head.","Then, after a short pause during which he pondered but said nothing, the gentleman from San Francisco dismissed him with a nod.","The Gentleman from San Francisco tarried a little, evidently musing on something, but said nothing, then dismissed him with a nod of his head."

"Выбрившись, вымывшись, ладно вставив несколько зубов, он, стоя перед зеркалами, смочил и придрал щетками в серебряной оправе остатки жемчужных волос вокруг смугло-желтого черепа, натянул на крепкое старческое тело с полнеющей от усиленного питания талией кремовое шелковое трико, а на сухие ноги с плоскими ступнями – черные шелковые чулки и бальные туфли, приседая, привел в порядок высоко подтянутые шелковыми помочами черные брюки и белоснежную, с выпятившейся грудью рубашку, вправил в блестящие манжеты запонки и стал мучиться с ловлей под твердым воротничком запонки шейной. Пол еще качался под ним, кончикам пальцев было очень больно, запонка порой крепко кусала дряблую кожицу в углублении под кадыком, но он был настойчив и, наконец, с сияющими от напряжения глазами, весь сизый от сдавившего ему горло не в меру тугого воротничка, таки доделал дело – и в изнеможении присел перед трюмо, весь отражаясь в нем и повторяясь в других зеркалах.","Having shaved, washed, properly inserted several teeth, standing in front of the mirrors, he moistened and pried with brushes in a silver frame the remnants of pearl hair around a swarthy yellow skull, pulled on a strong senile body with a waist plump from enhanced nutrition, and on dry legs with flat feet - black silk stockings and ballroom shoes, crouching, he put in order the black trousers and the snow-white shirt with a protruding chest, which were highly pulled up with silk straps, set the cufflinks into the shiny cuffs and began to suffer with catching under the hard collar of the cufflinks of the neck. The floor was still swaying under him, his fingertips were very painful, the cufflink sometimes bit hard on the flabby skin in the recess under the Adam's apple, but he was persistent and, finally, with eyes shining from tension, all gray from the excessively tight collar that squeezed his throat, still finished the job - and in exhaustion sat down in front of the dressing table, all reflected in it and repeated in other mirrors.","Having shaved, washed, and dexterously arranged several artificial teeth, standing in front of the mirror, he moistened his silver-mounted brushes and plastered the remains of his thick pearly hair on his swarthy yellow skull. He drew on to his strong old body, with its abdomen protuberant from excessive good living, his cream-coloured silk underwear, put black silk socks and patent-leather slippers on his flat-footed feet. He put sleeve-links in the shining cuffs of his snow-white shirt, and bending forward so that his shirt front bulged out, he arranged his trousers that were pulled up high by his silk braces, and began to torture himself, putting his collar-stud through the stiff collar. The floor was still rocking beneath him, the tips of his fingers hurt, the stud at moments pinched the flabby skin in the recess under his Adam's apple, but he persisted, and at last, with eyes all strained and face dove-blue from the over-tight collar that enclosed his throat, he finished the business and sat down exhausted in front of the pier glass, which reflected the whole of him, and repeated him in all the other mirrors.","When he had shaved, washed and inserted one or two false teeth, he stood in front of the mirror, moistened the remaining strands of his pearly-grey hair and arranged them round his sallow skull with a pair of silver-backed brushes, drew cream silk underpants onto his firm elderly body with its overfed, spreading waist and slipped black silk socks and evening shoes over his dry, flat feet. Then with a quick bend of the knees he arranged his black trousers, pulled high with silk braces, and then his snow-white, billowing shirt, inserted cuff-links into the dazzling cuffs and embarked on a painful chase after the stud under the stiff collar. The floor still swayed under him and the tips of his fingers hurt as the stud kept digging into the flabby skin in the hollow under his Adam’s apple, but he persisted and at last, with eyes shining from the exertion and face flushed from the tight collar which constricted his throat, succeeded in his efforts and sank exhausted in front of the pier-glass which threw back his full reflection, as did all the other mirrors.","Having shaved and washed himself, and dexterously put in place a few false teeth, he then, standing before the mirror, moistened and vigorously plastered what was left of his thick pearly-colored hair, close to his tawny-yellow skull. Then he put on, with some effort, a tight-fitting undershirt of cream-colored silk, fitted tight to his strong, aged body with its waist swelling out because of an abundant diet; and he pulled black silk socks and patent-leather dancing shoes on his dry feet with their fallen arches. Squatting down, he set right his black trousers, drawn high by means of silk suspenders, adjusted his snow-white shirt with its bulging front, put the buttons into the shining cuffs, and began the painful process of hunting up the front button under the hard collar. The floor was still swaying under him, the tips of his fingers hurt terribly, the button at times painfully pinched the flabby skin in the depression under his Adam's apple, but he persevered, and finally, with his eyesshining from the effort, his face blue because of the narrow collar which squeezed his neck, he triumphed over the difficulties —— and all exhausted, he sat down before the glass-pier, his reflected image repeating itself in all the mirrors."

"Океан с гулом ходил за стеной черными горами, вьюга крепко свистала в отяжелевших снастях, пароход весь дрожал, одолевая и ее, и эти горы, – точно плугом разваливая на стороны их зыбкие, то и дело вскипавшие и высоко взвивавшиеся пенистыми хвостами громады, – в смертной тоске стенала удушаемая туманом сирена, мерзли от стужи и шалели от непосильного напряжения внимания вахтенные на своей вышке, мрачным и знойным недрам преисподней, ее последнему, девятому кругу была подобна подводная утроба парохода, – та, где глухо гоготали исполинские топки, пожиравшие своими раскаленными зевами груды каменного угля, с грохотом ввергаемого в них облитыми едким, грязным потом и по пояс голыми людьми, багровыми от пламени; а тут, в баре, беззаботно закидывали ноги на ручки кресел, цедили коньяк и ликеры, плавали в волнах пряного дыма, в танцевальной зале все сияло и изливало свет, тепло и радость, пары то крутились в вальсах, то изгибались в танго – и музыка настойчиво, в какой-то сладостно-бесстыдной печали молила все об одном, все о том же… Был среди этой блестящей толпы некий великий богач, бритый, длинный, похожий на прелата, в старомодном фраке, был знаменитый испанский писатель, была всесветная красавица, была изящная влюбленная пара, за которой все с любопытством следили и которая не скрывала своего счастья: он танцевал только с ней, и все выходило у них так тонко, очаровательно, что только один командир знал, что эта пара нанята Ллойдом играть в любовь за хорошие деньги и уже давно плавает то на одном, то на другом корабле.","The ocean roared behind the wall in black mountains, the blizzard whistled strongly in the heavy gears, the steamer trembled all over, overcoming both it and these mountains, as if with a plow breaking apart their unsteady, now and then boiling and foamy tails, huge masses, a siren choked with mist moaned in mortal anguish, the watchmen on their tower froze from the cold and went crazy from the unbearable strain of attention, to the gloomy and sultry bowels of the underworld, its last, ninth circle was like the underwater womb of a steamboat - the one where gigantic fireboxes devouring with their red-hot mouths of heaps of coal, with a roar thrown into them, drenched in acrid, dirty sweat and waist-deep naked people, purple from the flames; and here, in the bar, they carelessly threw their legs on the arms of their chairs, sipped cognac and liqueurs, floated in waves of spicy smoke, everything in the dance hall shone and poured out light, warmth and joy, couples either spun in waltzes, or bent into tango - and the music insistently, in a kind of sweetly shameless sadness, she prayed all about one thing, all about the same ... Among this brilliant crowd there was a certain great rich man, clean-shaven, long, like a prelate, in an old-fashioned tailcoat, there was a famous Spanish writer, there was a universal beauty, there was an elegant couple in love, whom everyone watched with curiosity and who did not hide their happiness: he danced only with her, and everything came out with them so subtly, charmingly, that only one commander knew that this couple was hired by Lloyd to play love for good money and has long been floating on one ship or another.","Outside, the ocean heaved in black mountains; the snow-storm hissed furiously in the clogged cordage; the steamer trembled in every fibre as she surmounted these watery hills and struggled with the storm, ploughing through the moving masses which every now and then reared in front of her, foam-crested. The siren, choked by the fog, groaned in mortal anguish. The watchmen in the look-out towers froze with cold, and went mad with their super-human straining of attention. As the gloomy and sultry depths of the inferno, as the ninth circle, was the submerged womb of the steamer, where gigantic furnaces roared and dully giggled, devouring with their red-hot maws mountains of coal cast hoarsely in by men naked to the waist, bathed in their own corrosive dirty sweat, and lurid with the purple-red reflection of flame. But in the refreshment bar men jauntily put their feet up on the tables, showing their patent-leather pumps, and sipped cognac or other liqueurs, and swam in waves of fragrant smoke as they chatted in well-bred manner. In the dancing hall light and warmth and joy were poured over everything; couples turned in the waltz or writhed in the tango, while the music insistently, shamelessly, delightfully, with sadness entreated for one, only one thing, one and the same thing all the time. Amongst this resplendent crowd was an ambassador, a little dry modest old man; a great millionaire, clean-shaven, tall, of an indefinite age, looking like a prelate in his old-fashioned dress-coat; also a famous Spanish author, and an international beauty already the least bit faded, of unenviable reputation; finally an exquisite loving couple, whom everybody watched curiously because of their unconcealed happiness: he danced only with her, and sang, with great skill, only to her accompaniment, and everything about them seemed so charming!--and only the captain knew that this couple had been engaged by the steamship company to play at love for a good salary, and that they had been sailing for a long time, now on one liner, now on another.","The mountainous black ocean waves ran booming outside while the snowstorm whistled powerfully through the burdened rigging, and the whole liner would shudder as it strove against both storm and waves, like a plough turning over the ocean’s heaving mass which incessantly seethed and soared up with lappets of foam; the siren, muffled by the mist, groaned in mortal anguish; the men on watch froze in the cold and felt their minds wandering from over-concentrated attention; the underwater depths of the liner, where gigantic furnaces voicelessly cackled and with their candescent gorges devoured the piles of coal clangorously shovelled into them by half-naked men who were bathed in acrid, dirty sweat and lurid from the flames, were like the torrid dark bowels of the last, ninth circle of the inferno; but in the bar the passengers jauntily put their feet up on the arms of chairs, decanted brandy and liqueurs and swam in waves of heady smoke; the ballroom sparkled and everything exuded light, warmth and joy; couples spun round in the waltz or bent in the tango, while the music in its sweetly brazen melancholy insistently implored ever one and the same thing … Among this resplendent throng was a certain great tycoon, clean-shaven and tall in his old-fashioned tails, there was a celebrated Spanish author, there was an international beauty, and there was an elegant couple very much in love whom everyone watched with curiosity and who made no attempt to conceal their happiness: he danced only with her and everything they did was so refined and charming that only the captain knew that they were paid by Lloyds to feign their love for high wages and had long been sailing on one ship after another.","Outside, the ocean tossed up black mountains with a thud; and the snowstorm hissedfuriously in the rigging grown heavy with slush; the ship trembled in every limb, struggling with the storm and ploughing with difficulty the shifting and seething mountainous masses that threw far and high their foaming tails; the siren groaned in agony, choked by storm and fog; the watchmen in their towers froze and almost went out of their minds under the superhuman stress of attention. Like the gloomy and sultry mass of the inferno, like its last, ninth circle, was the submersed womb of the steamer, where monstrous furnaces yawned with red-hot open jaws, and emitted deep, hooting sounds, and where the stokers, stripped to the waist, and purple with the reflected flames, bathed in their own dirty, acid sweat. And here, in the refreshment-bar, carefree men, with their feet, encased in dancing shoes, on the table, sipped cognac and liqueurs, swam in waves of spiced smoke, and exchanged subtle remarks, while in the dancing-hall everything sparkled and radiated light, warmth and joy. The couples now turned around in a waltz, now swayed in the tango; and the music, sweetly shameless and sad, persisted in its ceaseless entreaties . . . There were many persons of note in this magnificent crowd; an ambassador, a dry, modest old man; a great millionaire, shaved, tall, of an indefinite age, who, in his old-fashioned dress-coat, looked like a prelate; also a famous Spanish writer, and an international belle, already slightly faded and of dubious morals. There was also among them a loving pair, exquisite and refined, whom everybody watched with curiosity and who did not conceal their bliss; he danced only with her, sang —— with great skill —— only to her accompaniment, and they were so charming, so graceful. The captain alone knew that they had been hired by the company at a good salary to play at love, and that they had been sailing now on one, now on another steamer, for quite a long time."
"– На sonato, signore?[5] И из-за двери слышался неспешный и скрипучий, обидно вежливый голос:","– On sonato, signore?[5] And from behind the door came a slow and creaky, insultingly polite voice:","""Ha suonato, Signore?"" From behind the door, a slow, grating, offensively polite voice:","‘Ha sonato, signore?’ And from the other side of the door came a slow, grating, irritatingly polite voice:","""Ha sonata, Signore?"" (Did you ring, sir?) And from behind the door a slow, grating, insultingly polite voice, answered:"
"На этом острове, две тысячи лет тому назад, жил человек, совершенно запутавшийся в своих жестоких и грязных поступках, который почему-то забрал власть над миллионами людей и который, сам растерявшись от бессмысленности этой власти и от страха, что кто-нибудь убьет его из-за угла, наделал жестокостей сверх всякой меры, – и человечество навеки запомнило его, и те, что в совокупности своей, столь же непонятно и, по существу, столь же жестоко, как и он, властвуют теперь в мире, со всего света съезжаются смотреть на остатки того каменного дома, где он жил на одном из самых крутых подъемов острова. В это чудесное утро все, приехавшие на Капри именно с этой целью, еще спали по гостиницам, хотя к подъездам гостиниц уже вели маленьких мышастых осликов под красными седлами, на которые опять должны были нынче, проснувшись и наевшись, взгромоздиться молодые и старые американцы и американки, немцы и немки и за которыми опять должны были бежать по каменистым тропинкам, и все в гору, вплоть до самой вершины Монте-Тиберио, нищие каприйские старухи с палками в жилистых руках. Успокоенные тем, что мертвого старика из Сан-Франциско, тоже собиравшегося ехать с ними, но вместо того только напугавшего их напоминанием о смерти, уже отправили в Неаполь, путешественники спали крепким сном, и на острове было еще тихо, магазины в городе были еще закрыты. Торговал только рынок на маленькой площади – рыбой и зеленью, и были на нем одни простые люди, среди которых, как всегда, без всякого дела, стоял Лоренцо, высокий старик лодочник, беззаботный гуляка и красавец, знаменитый по всей Италии, не раз служивший моделью многим живописцам: он принес и уже продал за бесценок двух пойманных им ночью омаров, шуршавших в переднике повара того самого отеля, где ночевала семья из Сан-Франциско, и теперь мог спокойно стоять хоть до вечера, с царственной повадкой поглядывая вокруг, рисуясь своими лохмотьями, глиняной трубкой и красным шерстяным беретом, спущенным на одно ухо. А по обрывам Монте-Соляро, по древней финикийской дороге, вырубленной в скалах, по ее каменным ступенькам, спускались от Анакапри два абруццских горца. У одного под кожаным плащом была волынка, – большой козий мех с двумя дудками, у другого – нечто вроде деревянной цевницы. Шли они – и целая страна, радостная, прекрасная, солнечная, простирались под ними: и каменистые горбы острова, который почти весь лежал у их ног, и та сказочная синева, в которой плавал он, и сияющие утренние пары над морем к востоку, под ослепительным солнцем, которое уже жарко грело, поднимаясь все выше и выше, и туманно-лазурные, еще по-утреннему зыбкие массивы Италии, ее близких и далеких гор, красоту которых бессильно выразить человеческое слово. На полпути они замедлили шаг: над дорогой, в гроте скалистой стены Монте-Соляро, вся озаренная солнцем, вся в тепле и блеске его, стояла в белоснежных гипсовых одеждах и в царском венце, золотисто-ржавом от непогод, матерь божия, кроткая и милостивая, с очами, поднятыми к небу, к вечным и блаженным обителям трижды благословенного сына ее. Они обнажили головы, приложили к губам свои цевницы – и полились наивные и смиренно-радостные хвалы их солнцу, утру, ей, непорочной заступнице всех страждущих в этом злом и прекрасном мире, и рожденному от чрева ее в пещере Вифлеемской, в бедном пастушеском приюте, в далекой земле Иудиной…","On this island, two thousand years ago, there lived a man who was completely entangled in his cruel and dirty deeds, who for some reason took power over millions of people and who, himself confused by the senselessness of this power and fear that someone would kill him from around the corner, committed cruelties beyond all measure - and humanity will forever remember him, and those who, in their totality, are just as incomprehensible and, in essence, just as cruel as he, now rule the world, from all over the world come to look at the remains of the stone house where he lived on one of the steepest slopes of the island. On this wonderful morning, everyone who had come to Capri for this very purpose was still sleeping in hotels, although little mouse donkeys under red saddles were already being led to the entrances of the hotels, on which young and old Americans and American women were supposed to pile up again today, having woken up and eaten. , Germans and Germans, and after whom they again had to run along stony paths, and all uphill, right up to the very top of Monte Tiberio, impoverished old Capri women with sticks in their sinewy hands. Reassured by the fact that the dead old man from San Francisco, who was also going to go with them, but instead of only scaring them with a reminder of death, had already been sent to Naples, the travelers slept soundly, and the island was still quiet, the shops in the city were still closed . Only the market in a small square sold fish and herbs, and there were only ordinary people among whom, as always, without any business, stood Lorenzo, a tall old boatman, a carefree reveler and a handsome man, famous throughout Italy, who more than once served as a model many painters: he brought and already sold for a song two lobsters he caught at night, rustling in the apron of the cook of the very hotel where the family from San Francisco spent the night, and now he could calmly stand until evening, glancing around with regal habit, showing off with his rags , a clay pipe and a red woolen beret, lowered over one ear. And along the cliffs of Monte Solaro, along the ancient Phoenician road carved into the rocks, along its stone steps, two Abruzzo mountaineers descended from Anacapri. One had a bagpipe under a leather cloak - a large goat fur with two pipes, the other had something like a wooden tong. They walked - and a whole country, joyful, beautiful, sunny, stretched under them: and the rocky humps of the island, which lay almost entirely at their feet, and that fabulous blue in which he swam, and the shining morning vapors over the sea to the east, under the dazzling sun, which was already warming hot, rising higher and higher, and the misty-azure, unsteady massifs of Italy, its near and distant mountains, the beauty of which is powerless to express the human word. Halfway they slowed down: above the road, in the grotto of the rocky wall of Monte Solaro, all illuminated by the sun, all in its warmth and brilliance, stood in snow-white plaster clothes and in a royal crown, golden-rusty from bad weather, the Mother of God, meek and merciful , with eyes raised to heaven, to the eternal and blessed abodes of her thrice-blessed son. They bared their heads, put their tarts to their lips - and naive and humbly joyful praises poured out to their sun, to the morning, to her, the immaculate intercessor of all those who suffer in this evil and beautiful world, and who was born from her womb in the cave of Bethlehem, in a poor shepherd's shelter, in the distant land of Judah...","On that island two thousand years ago lived a man entangled in his own infamous and strange acts, one whose rule for some reason extended over millions of people, and who, having lost his head through the absurdity of such power, committed deeds which have established him for ever in the memory of mankind; mankind which in the mass now rules the world just as hideously and incomprehensibly as he ruled it then. And men come here from all quarters of the globe to look at the ruins of the stone house where that one man lived, on the brink of one of the steepest cliffs in the island. On this exquisite morning all who had come to Capri for that purpose were still asleep in the hotels, although through the streets already trotted little mouse-coloured donkeys with red saddles, towards the hotel entrances where they would wait patiently until, after a good sleep and a square meal, young and old American men and women, German men and women would emerge and be hoisted up into the saddles, to be followed up the stony paths, yea to the very summit of Monte Tiberio, by old persistent beggar-women of Capri, with sticks in their sinewy hands. Quieted by the fact that the dead old Gentleman from San Francisco, who had intended to be one of the pleasure party but who had only succeeded in frightening the rest with the reminder of death, was now being shipped to Naples, the happy tourists still slept soundly, the island was still quiet, the shops in the little town not yet open. Only fish and greens were being sold in the tiny piazza, only simple folk were present, and amongst them, as usual without occupation, the tall old boatman Lorenzo, thorough debauchee and handsome figure, famous all over Italy, model for many a picture. He had already sold for a trifle two lobsters which he had caught in the night, and which were rustling in the apron of the cook of that very same hotel where the family from San Francisco had spent the night. And now Lorenzo could stand calmly till evening, with a majestic air showing off his rags and gazing round, holding his clay pipe with its long reed mouth-piece in his hand, and letting his scarlet bonnet slip over one ear. For as a matter of fact he received a salary from the little town, from the commune which found it profitable to pay him to stand about and make a picturesque figure--as everybody knows.... Down the precipices of Monte Solaro, down the stony little stairs cut in the rock of the old Phœnician road came two Abruzzi mountaineers, descending from Anacapri. One carried a bagpipe under his leather cloak, a large goat skin with two little pipes; the other had a sort of wooden flute. They descended, and the whole land, joyous, was sunny beneath them. They saw the rocky, heaving shoulder of the island, which lay almost entirely at their feet, swimming in the fairy blueness of the water. Shining morning vapours rose over the sea to the east, under a dazzling sun which already burned hot as it rose higher and higher; and there, far off, the dimly cerulean masses of Italy, of her near and far mountains, still wavered blue as if in the world's morning, in a beauty no words can express.... Halfway down the descent the pipers slackened their pace. Above the road, in a grotto of the rocky face of Monte Solaro stood the Mother of God, the sun full upon her, giving her a splendour of snow-white and blue raiment, and royal crown rusty from all weathers. Meek and merciful, she raised her eyes to heaven, to the eternal and blessed mansions of her thrice-holy Son. The pipers bared their heads, put their pipes to their lips: and there streamed forth naive and meekly joyous praises to the sun, to the morning, to Her, Immaculate, who would intercede for all who suffer in this malicious and lovely world, and to Him, born of Her womb among the caves of Bethlehem, in a lowly shepherd's hut, in the far Judean land....","On that island two thousand years ago there lived a man unspeakably loathsome in the pursuit of his lusts and somehow possessing power over millions of people whom he subjected to immeasurable cruelties; mankind has remembered him for all time, and countless visitors from all quarters of the globe come to gaze at the ruins of the stone palace where he lived at the top of one of the island’s steepest ascents. That superb morning all those who had travelled to Capri for this purpose were still asleep in their hotels, although at the hotel entrances drivers were already gathering their mousy little donkeys with the red saddles into which, once they had wakened and breakfasted, elderly Americans and Germans were due to clamber again that day and behind which old Capriote beggar-women were again due to run along the stone paths, always uphill, right to the summit of Monte Tiberio, with sticks in their sinewy hands for goading the donkeys. Soothed by the knowledge that the dead gentleman from San Francisco (who had been planning to go with them, but who had instead only succeeded in frightening them by reminding them of death) had already been dispatched to Naples, the travellers were sleeping soundly, and the island was still quiet, with the shops in the town still silent. The only market open was the little one in the square selling fish and vegetables, and only the common folk were there; among them, idle as always, stood Lorenzo, a tall elderly boatman, an irresponsible rake and a handsome figure who was renowned throughout Italy, having served numerous painters as a model. He had brought along and already sold for a song two lobsters which he had caught during the night and which were rustling in the apron of the cook from the very hotel where the family from San Francisco had spent the night, and now he could stand there the whole day if he chose, looking about him with a royal air and striking poses in his rags, with his clay pipe and with a red woollen beret pulled down over one ear. And through the ravines of Monte Solaro two Abruzzian highlanders were descending from Anacapri down the stone steps of the ancient Phoenician road cut through the rocks. Under his leather cloak one of them held a bagpipe, a large goatskin with two stems while the other had a sort of ancient wooden flute. They walked along and the whole countryside, joyous, beautiful and sunny, spread out beneath them; they could see the stony humps of the island lying almost in its entirety at their feet and the fabulous blue expanse on which it floated, and the radiant morning haze over the sea to the east under a brilliant sun which was already burning fiercely as it rose higher and higher, and the massive, misty blue silhouette of Italy still shimmering in the morning light, and her mountains both close and distant, whose beauty no human words can describe. Halfway down the descent their steps slowed: above the road, in a grotto hewn out of the rock-face of Monte Solaro, an image of the Holy Virgin stood radiant in the warm brilliance of the sun, in her snow-white plaster robes and rusty royal golden crown, gentle and benevolent and with eyes uplifted towards the eternally blissful mansions of her thrice-blessed son. The highlanders bared their heads, their naïve, humble and joyous praises streamed forth to the sun, to the morning, to her, the immaculate Protectress of all who suffer in this wicked and beautiful world, and to the child born of her womb in that Bethlehem stable, refuge of lowly shepherds in the far Judaean land …","Two thousand years ago there had lived on that island a man who became utterly entangled in his own brutal and filthy actions. For some unknown reason he usurped the rule over millions of men and found himself bewildered by the absurdity of this power, while the fear that someone might kill him unawares, made him commit deeds inhuman beyond all measure. And mankind has forever retained his memory, and those who, taken together, now rule the world, as incomprehensibly and, essentially, as cruelly as he did, —— come from all the corners of the earth to look at the remnants of the stone house he inhabited, which stands on one of the steepest cliffs of the island. On that wonderful morning the tourists, who had come to Capri for precisely that purpose, were still asleep in the various hotels, but tiny long-eared asses under red saddles were already being led to the hotel entrances. Americans and Germans, men and women, old and young, after having arisen and breakfasted heartily, were to scramble on them, and the old beggar-women of Capri, with sticks in their sinewy hands, were again torun after them along stony, mountainous paths, all the way up to the summit of Monte Tiberia. The dead old man from San Francisco, who had planned to keep the tourists company but who had, instead, only scared them by reminding them of death, was already shipped to Naples, and soothed by this, the travelers slept soundly, and silence reigned over the island. The stores in the little town were still closed, with the exception of the fish and greens market on the tiny square. Among the plain people who filled it, going about their business, stood idly by, as usual, Lorenzo, a tall old boatman, a carefree reveller and once a handsome man, famous all over Italy, who had many times served as a model for painters. He had brought and already sold —— for a song —— two big sea-crawfish, which he had caught at night and which were rustling in the apron of Don Cataldo, the cook of the hotel where the family from San Francisco had been lodged, —— and now Lorenzo could stand calmly until nightfall, wearing princely airs, showing off his rags, his clay pipe with its long reed mouth-piece, and his red woolen cap, tilted on one ear. Meanwhile, among the precipices of Monte Solare, down the ancient Phoenician road, cut in the rocks in the form of a gigantic staircase, two Abruzzi mountaineers were coming from Anacapri. One carried under his leather mantle a bagpipe, a large goat's skin with two pipes; the other, something in the nature of a wooden flute. They walked, and the entire country, joyous, beautiful, sunny, stretched below them; the rocky shoulders of the island, which lay at their feet, the fabulous blue in which it swam, the shining morning vapors over the sea westward, beneath the dazzling sun, and the wavering masses of Italy's mountains, both near and distant, whose beauty human word is powerless to render. . . Midway they slowed up. Overshadowing the road stood, in a grotto of the rock wall of Monte Solare, the Holy Virgin, all radiant, bathed in the warmth and the splendor of the sun. The rust of her snow-white plaster-of-Parisvestures and queenly crown was touched into gold, and there were meekness and mercy in her eyes raised toward the heavens, toward the eternal and beatific abode of her thrice-blessed Son. They bared their heads, applied the pipes to their lips, —— and praises flowed on, candid and humbly-joyous, praises to the sun and the morning, to Her, the Immaculate Intercessor for all who suffer in this evil and beautiful world, and to Him who had been born of her womb in the cavern of Bethlehem, in a hut of lowly shepherds in distant Judea."

"Только что отбыла гостившая на Капри высокая особа – Рейс XVII. И гостям из Сан-Франциско отвели те самые апартаменты, что занимал он. К ним приставили самую красивую и умелую горничную, бельгийку, с тонкой и твердой от корсета талией и в крахмальном чепчике в виде маленькой зубчатой короны, самого видного из лакеев, угольно-черного, огнеглазого сицилийца, и самого расторопного коридорного, маленького и полного Луиджи, много переменившего подобных мест на своем веку. А через минуту в дверь комнаты господина из Сан-Франциско легонько стукнул француз метрдотель, явившийся, чтобы узнать, будут ли господа приезжие обедать, и в случае утвердительного ответа, в котором, впрочем, не было сомнения, доложить, что сегодня лангуст, ростбиф, спаржа, фазаны и так далее. Пол еще ходил под господином из Сан-Франциско, – так закачал его этот дрянной итальянский пароходишко, – но он не спеша, собственноручно, хотя с непривычки и не совсем ловко, закрыл хлопнувшее при входе метрдотеля окно, из которого пахнуло запахом дальней Кухни и мокрых цветов в саду, и с неторопливой отчетливостью ответил, что обедать они будут, что столик для них должен быть поставлен подальше от дверей, в самой, глубине залы, что пить они будут вино местное, и каждому его слову метрдотель поддакивал в самых разнообразных интонациях, имевших, однако, только тот смысл, что нет и не может быть сомнения в правоте желаний господина из Сан-Франциско и что все, будет исполнено в точности. Напоследок он склонил голову и деликатно спросил:","A high-ranking person who was visiting Capri has just departed - Flight XVII. And the guests from San Francisco were given the very apartments that he occupied. They were assigned the most beautiful and skillful maid, a Belgian, with a thin and hard waist from the corset and in a starched cap in the form of a small jagged crown, the most prominent of the lackeys, a coal-black, fire-eyed Sicilian, and the most efficient bellhop, small and plump Luigi, who has changed many such places in his lifetime. And a minute later, a French maitre d' lightly knocked on the door of the gentleman's room from San Francisco, who had come to find out if the gentlemen would have dinner, and in the case of an affirmative answer, in which, however, there was no doubt, to report that today lobster, roast beef, asparagus, pheasants and so on. Paul was still walking under the gentleman from San Francisco—this was how that wretched Italian steamboat rocked him—but he slowly, with his own hand, although out of habit and not quite dexterously, closed the window that slammed at the entrance of the head waiter, from which came the smell of the distant Kitchen and wet flowers in the garden, and with unhurried distinctness answered that they would dine, that a table for them should be placed away from the doors, in the very back of the hall, that they would drink local wine, and the head waiter echoed his every word in a wide variety of intonations, which, however, had only the meaning that there is not and cannot be any doubt about the correctness of the desires of the gentleman from San Francisco and that everything will be executed exactly. Finally, he bowed his head and delicately asked:","Reuss XVII. , a high personage who had spent three whole weeks on Capri, had just left, and the visitors were installed in the suite of rooms that he had occupied. To them was assigned the most beautiful and expert chambermaid, a Belgian with a thin, firmly corseted figure, and a starched cap in the shape of a tiny indented crown. The most experienced and distinguished-looking footman was placed at their service, a coal-black, fiery-eyed Sicilian, and also the smartest waiter, the small, stout Luigi, a tremendous buffoon, who had seen a good deal of life. In a minute or two a gentle tap was heard at the door of the Gentleman from San Francisco, and there stood the maître d'hôtel, a Frenchman, who had come to ask if the guests would take dinner, and to report, in case of answer in the affirmative--of which, however, he had small doubt--that this evening there were Mediterranean lobsters, roast beef, asparagus, pheasants, etc., etc. The floor was still rocking under the feet of the Gentleman from San Francisco, so rolled about had he been on that wretched, grubby Italian steamer. Yet with his own hands, calmly, though clumsily from lack of experience, he closed the window which had banged at the entrance of the maître d'hôtel, shutting out the drifting smell of distant kitchens and of wet flowers in the garden. Then he turned and replied with unhurried distinctness, that they would take dinner, that their table must be far from the door, in the very centre of the dining-room, that they would have local wine and champagne, moderately dry and slightly cooled. To all of which the maître d'hôtel gave assent in the most varied intonations, which conveyed that there was not and could not be the faintest question of the justness of the desires of the Gentleman from San Francisco, and that everything should be exactly as he wished. At the end he inclined his head and politely inquired:","A distinguished visitor to Capri, Prince Reuss XVII, had just left. And the visitors from San Francisco were installed in the very apartments which he had occupied. To them were assigned the prettiest and most expert chambermaid, a Belgian girl with a slender, tightly corseted waist and a little starched cap like a small serrated crown, the most presentable footman, a coal-black, fiery-eyed Sicilian, and the most efficient boots, little fat Luigi who had held many similar posts in his time. A minute later the French maître d’hôtel tapped lightly on the door of the gentleman from San Francisco’s room to ask whether the esteemed new visitors would be dining and to announce – in the event of an affirmative response which was of course not in doubt – that today there was lobster, beef, asparagus, pheasant, etc. The floor was still swaying under the gentleman from San Francisco, such a shaking-up had he been given by that wretched little Italian steamer, but carefully, though from unfamiliarity somewhat clumsily, he shut the window which had rattled as the maître d’hôtel entered and through which now wafted aromas from the distant kitchen and the wet flowers in the garden, and replied with slow precision that they would be dining, that a table should be reserved for them at the far end of the dining-room, away from the entrance, and that they would drink the local wine; and to each word the maître d’hôtel expressed his assent in a range of intonations all of which implied that there was not and could not possibly be any doubt about the appropriateness of the gentleman from San Francisco’s wishes and that every one of them would be carried out to the letter. Finally he inclined his head and fastidiously inquired:","A person of high dignity, Rex XVII, who had spent three entire weeks on Capri, had just left the island, and the guests from San Francisco were given the apartments he had occupied. At their disposal was put the most handsome and skillful chambermaid, a Belgian, with a figure rendered slim and firm by her corset, and with a starched cap, shaped like a small, indented crown; and they had the privilege of being served by the most well-appearing and portly footman, a black, fiery-eyed Sicilian, and by the quickest waiter, the small, stout Luigi, who was a fiend at cracking jokes and had changed many places in his life. Then the ma�e-d'h�, a Frenchman, gently rapped at the door of the American gentleman's room. He came to ask whether the gentleman and the ladies would dine, and in case they would, which he did not doubt, to report that there was to be had that day lobsters, roast beef, asparagus, pheasants, etc., etc. The floor was still rocking under the Gentleman from San Francisco —— so sea-sick had the wretched Italian steamer made him —— yet, he slowly, though awkwardly, shut the window which had banged when the ma�e-d'h� entered, and which let in the smell of the distant kitchen and wet flowers in the garden,and answered with slow distinctness, that they would dine, that their table must be placed farther away from the door, in the depth of the hall, that they would have local wine and champagne, moderately dry and but slightly cooled. The ma�e-d'h� approved the words of the guest in various intonations, which all meant, however, only one thing; there is and can be no doubt that the desires of the Gentleman from San Francisco are right, and that everything would be carried out, in exact conformity with his words. At last he inclined his head and asked delicately:"
Апокалипсис,Apocalypse,Apocalypse.,,THE Gentleman from San Francisco —— neither at Naples nor on Capri could any one recall his name ——
"Однако декабрь выдался в тот год не совсем удачный: портье, когда с ними говорили о погоде, только виновато поднимали плечи, бормоча, что такого года они и не запомнят, хотя уже не первый год приходилось им бормотать это и ссылаться на то, что «всюду происходит что-то ужасное»: на Ривьере небывалые ливни и бури, в Афинах снег, Этна тоже вся занесена и по ночам светит, из Палермо туристы, спасаясь от стужи, разбегаются… Утреннее солнце каждый день обманывало: с полудня неизменно серело и начинал сеять дождь, да все гуще и холоднее: тогда пальмы у подъезда отеля блестели жестью, город казался особенно грязным и тесным, музеи чересчур однообразными, сигарные окурки толстяков-извозчиков в резиновых, крыльями развевающихся по ветру накидках – нестерпимо вонючими, энергичное хлопанье их бичей над тонкошеими клячами явно фальшивым, обувь синьоров, разметающих трамвайные рельсы, ужасною, а женщины, шлепающие по грязи, под дождем, с черными раскрытыми головами, – безобразно коротконогими; про сырость же и вонь гнилой рыбой от пенящегося у набережной моря и говорить нечего.","However, December turned out to be not entirely successful that year: the porters, when they talked to them about the weather, only raised their shoulders guiltily, muttering that they would not remember such a year, although for more than a year they had to mutter this and refer to the fact that “ something terrible is happening everywhere ”: unprecedented downpours and storms on the Riviera, snow in Athens, Etna is also all covered and shines at night, tourists from Palermo, fleeing the cold, scatter ... The morning sun deceived every day: from noon it invariably turned gray and began sow rain, but it’s getting thicker and colder: then the palm trees at the entrance of the hotel shone with tin, the city seemed especially dirty and cramped, the museums were too monotonous, the cigar butts of fat cabbies in rubber capes fluttering in the wind with wings - unbearably smelly, the vigorous clapping of their whips over with thin-necked nags obviously false, the shoes of the gentlemen who sweep the tram rails are terrible, and the women splashing in the mud, in the rain, with black open heads, are ugly short-legged; about the dampness and the stench of rotten fish from the sea foaming near the embankment and there is nothing to say.","None the less, December of that year was not a success for Naples. The porters and secretaries were abashed if spoken to about the weather, only guiltily lifting their shoulders and murmuring that they could not possibly remember such a season; although this was not the first year they had had to make such murmurs, or to hint that ""everywhere something terrible is happening."" ... Unprecedented rains and storms on the Riviera, snow in Athens , Etna also piled with snow and glowing red at night; tourists fleeing from the cold of Palermo.... The morning sun daily deceived the Neapolitans. The sky invariably grew grey towards midday, and fine rain began to fall, falling thicker and colder. The palms of the hotel approach glistened like wet tin; the city seemed peculiarly dirty and narrow, the museums excessively dull; the cigar-ends of the fat cab-men, whose rubber rain-capes flapped like wings in the wind, seemed insufferably stinking, the energetic cracking of whips over the ears of thin-necked horses sounded altogether false, and the clack of the shoes of the signorini who cleaned the tram-lines quite horrible, while the women, walking through the mud, with their black heads uncovered in the rain, seemed disgustingly short-legged: not to mention the stench and dampness of foul fish which drifted from the quay where the sea was foaming.","However, December turned out less than successful. Whenever the porters were asked about the weather they only shrugged their shoulders ruefully and muttered that no one could recall another year like it, though it wasn’t the first time they had had to mutter this and cite the dreadful things happening everywhere else: unheard-of downpours and storms on the Riviera, snow in Athens, Etna also covered in snow and glowing at night, and tourists running away from Palermo to escape the frosts … Every day the morning sun was deceptive in that after midday the sky would cloud over and the rain would come down harder and colder; then the palm trees outside the entrance to the hotel would gleam like wet tin, the town would seem especially dirty and crowded, the museums excessively dull, the cigar-butts of the fat cabmen in their wind-blown rubber capes insufferably foul, the energetic cracking of their whips over the heads of their scrawny horses obviously false, the footwear of the signori sweeping the tramlines ghastly, and the women splashing through the mud with their dark heads bare to the rain outrageously short-legged; the overwhelming dampness and the stink of putrid fish coming from the sea foaming along the quay were simply indescribable.","That year, however, December did not happen to be a very propitious one. The doormen were abashed when people spoke to them about the weather, and shrugged their shoulders guiltily, mumbling that they could not recollect such a year, although, to tell the truth, it was not the first year they mumbled those words, usually adding that ""things are terrible everywhere"": that unprecedented showers and storms had broken out on the Riviera, that it was snowing in Athens, that Aetna, too, was all blocked up with snow, and glowed brightly at night, and that tourists were fleeing from Palermo to save themselves from the cold spell . . . That winter, the morning sun daily deceived Naples: toward noon the sky would invariably grow gray, and a light rain would begin to fall, growing thicker and duller. Then the palms at the hotel-porch glistened disagreeably like wet tin, the town appeared exceptionally dirty and congested, the museums too monotonous, the cigars of the drivers in their rubber raincoats, which flattened in the wind like wings, intolerably stinking, and the energetic flapping of their whips over their thin-necked nags —— obviously false. The shoes of the signors, who cleaned thestreet-car tracks, were in a frightful state, the women who splashed in the mud, with black hair unprotected from the rain, were ugly and short-legged, and the humidity mingled with the foul smell of rotting fish, that came from the foaming sea, was simply disheartening."
"Маршрут был выработан господином из Сан-Франциско обширный. В декабре и январе он надеялся наслаждаться солнцем Южной Италии, памятниками древности, тарантеллой, серенадами бродячих певцов и тем, что люди в его годы чувствую! особенно тонко, – любовью молоденьких неаполитанок, пусть даже и не совсем бескорыстной, карнавал он думал провести в Ницце, в Монте-Карло, куда в эту пору стекается самое отборное общество, – то самое, от которого зависят вое блага цивилизации: и фасон смокингов, и прочность тронов, и объявление войн, и благосостояние отелей, – где одни с азартом предаются автомобильным и парусным гонкам, другие рулетке, третьи тому, что принято называть флиртом, а четвертые – стрельбе в голубей, которые очень красиво взвиваются из садков над изумрудным газоном, на фоне моря цвета незабудок, и тотчас же стукаются белыми комочками о землю; начало марта он хотел посвятить Флоренции, к страстям господним приехать в Рим, чтобы слушать там Miserere[1]; входили в его планы и Венеция, и Париж, и бой быков в Севилье, и купанье на английских островах, и Афины, и Константинополь, и Палестина, и Египет, и даже Япония, – разумеется, уже на обратном пути… И все пошло сперва отлично.","The route was developed by a gentleman from San Francisco extensive. In December and January, he hoped to enjoy the sun of southern Italy, the ancient monuments, the tarantella, the serenades of itinerant singers and what people at his age feel! especially subtly - with the love of young Neapolitan women, even if not entirely disinterested, he thought to hold a carnival in Nice, in Monte Carlo, where at that time the most selective society flocks - the very one on which all the blessings of civilization depend: and the style of tuxedos , and the strength of thrones, and the declaration of war, and the well-being of hotels - where some enthusiastically indulge in automobile and sailing races, others in roulette, others in what is commonly called flirting, and fourth in shooting pigeons, which soar very beautifully from the cages over the emerald lawn, against the background of the sea, the color of forget-me-nots, and immediately knock white lumps on the ground; he wanted to dedicate the beginning of March to Florence, to come to Rome to the passions of the Lord, to listen to the Miserere[1] there; Venice, and Paris, and a bullfight in Seville, and swimming in the English Isles, and Athens, and Constantinople, and Palestine, and Egypt, and even Japan were included in his plans - of course, already on the way back ... And everything went first Great.","The itinerary planned by the Gentleman of San Francisco was extensive. In December and January he hoped to enjoy the sun of southern Italy, the monuments of antiquity, the tarantella, the serenades of vagrant minstrels, and, finally, that which men of his age are most susceptible to, the love of quite young Neapolitan girls, even when the love is not altogether disinterestedly given. Carnival he thought of spending in Nice, in Monte Carlo, where at that season gathers the most select society, the precise society on which depend all the blessings of civilization--the fashion in evening dress, the stability of thrones, the declaration of wars, the prosperity of hotels; where some devote themselves passionately to automobile and boat races, others to roulette, others to what is called flirtation, and others to the shooting of pigeons which beautifully soar from their traps over emerald lawns, against a background of forget-me-not sea, instantly to fall, hitting the ground in little white heaps. The beginning of March he wished to devote to Florence, Passion Week in Rome, to hear the music of the Miserere; his plans also included Venice, Paris, bull-fights in Seville, bathing in the British Isles; then Athens, Constantinople, Egypt, even Japan ... certainly on his way home... . And everything at the outset went splendidly.","The gentleman from San Francisco had worked out an extensive itinerary. In December and January he was hoping to enjoy the sun of Southern Italy, the monuments of antiquity, the tarantella, the serenades of wandering musicians and also – something to which men of his age are particularly susceptible – the love of young Neapolitan girls, even if it should not be given entirely disinterestedly; he planned spending carnival time in Nice and Monte Carlo, where at that season the most select company gathers to indulge in motor-car and yacht racing, in roulette, in what is commonly called flirtation, or in pigeon-shooting – against the background of a forget-me-not-blue sea, birds very prettily soar up into the air from cages on emerald lawns, immediately to thud down on to the ground like little white bundles; he intended devoting the beginning of March to Florence, and then towards Holy Week he was to travel to Rome to hear a Miserere; his plans also included Venice and Paris, a bull-fight in Seville, sea-bathing in the British Isles, then Athens, Constantinople, Palestine, Egypt, and even Japan – the last of course on the return journey … And at first everything went splendidly. It was the end of November, and until they reached Gibraltar they had to sail through an icy murk alternating with flurries of wet snow, but they sailed perfectly safely.","The itinerary the Gentleman from San Francisco planned out was an extensive one. In December and January he expected to relish the sun of southern Italy, monuments of antiquity, the tarantella, serenades of wandering minstrels, and that which at his age is felt most keenly —— the love, not entirely disinterested though, of young Neapolitan girls. The Carnival days he planned to spend at Nice and Monte-Carlo, which at that time of the year is the meeting-place of the choicest society, the society upon which depend all the blessings of civilization: the cut of dress suits, the stability of thrones, the declaration of wars, the prosperity of hotels. Some of these people passionately give themselves over to automobile and boat races, others to roulette, others, again, busy themselves with what is called flirtation, and others shoot pigeons, which soar so beautifully from the dove-cote, hover a while over the emerald lawn, on the background of the forget-me-not colored sea, and then suddenly hit the ground, like little white lumps. Early March he wanted to devote to Florence, and at Easter, to hear the Miserere in Paris. His plans also included Venice, Paris, bull-baiting at Seville, bathing on the British Islands, also Athens, Constantinople, Palestine, Egypt, and even Japan, of course, on the way back. . . And at first things went very well indeed."
"Господин и госпожа из Сан-Франциско стали по утрам ссориться; дочь их то ходила бледная, с головной болью, то оживала, всем восхищалась и была тогда и мила и прекрасна: прекрасныбыли те нежные, сложные чувства, что пробудила в ней встреча с некрасивым человеком, в котором текла необычная кровь, ибо ведь в конце-то концов, может быть, и не важно, что именно пробуждает девичью душу – деньги ли, слава ли, знатность ли рода… Все уверяли, что совсем не то в Сорренто, на Капри – там и теплей, и солнечней, и лимоны цветут, и нравы честнее, и вино натуральней. И вот семья из Сан-Франциско решила отправиться со всеми своими сундуками на Капри, с тем, чтобы, осмотрев его, походив по камням на месте дворцов Тиверия, побывав в сказочных пещерах Лазурного грота и послушав абруццских волынщиков, целый месяц бродящих перед рождеством по острову и поющих хвалы деве Марии, поселиться в Сорренто.","The gentleman and lady from San Francisco began to quarrel in the morning; their daughter either walked around pale, with a headache, then came to life, admired everything and was then both sweet and beautiful: beautiful were those tender, complex feelings that a meeting with an ugly man in whom unusual blood flowed aroused in her, because in the end - in the end, maybe it doesn’t matter what exactly awakens the girl’s soul - is it money, is it fame, is it the nobility of the family ... Everyone assured that it’s not at all the same in Sorrento, on Capri - it’s warmer and sunny there, and lemons are blooming, and morals are more honest, and wine is more natural. And so the family from San Francisco decided to go with all their trunks to Capri, so that, after examining it, walking on the stones on the site of the palaces of Tiberius, visiting the fabulous caves of the Azure Grotto and listening to the Abruzzo pipers wandering around the island for a whole month before Christmas and singing praises to the Virgin Mary, to settle in Sorrento.","The gentleman and lady from San Francisco began to bicker in the mornings; their daughter went about pale and head-achey, and then roused up again, went into raptures over everything, and was lovely, charming. Charming were those tender, complicated feelings which had been aroused in her by the meeting with the plain little man in whose veins ran such special blood. But after all, does it matter what awakens a maiden soul--whether it is money, fame, or noble birth?... Everybody declared that in Sorrento, or in Capri, it was quite different. There it was warmer, sunnier, the lemon-trees were in bloom, the morals were purer, the wine unadulterated. So behold, the family from San Francisco decided to go with all their trunks to Capri, after which they would return and settle down in Sorrento: when they had seen Capri, trodden the stones where stood Tiberius' palaces, visited the famous caves of the Blue Grotto, and listened to the pipers from Abruzzi, who wander about the isle during the month of the Nativity, singing the praises of the Virgin.","The gentleman from San Francisco and his wife began to bicker in the mornings; their daughter would look pale and complain of headaches, or recover, go into raptures over everything and be sweet and beautiful; beautiful too were those tender, complex feelings which had been aroused in her by that encounter with the ugly man of special blood, for in the end it is perhaps not all that important what awakens a maiden’s heart – money, fame, or illustrious ancestry … Everyone assured them that it was quite different in Sorrento and on Capri – warmer and sunnier, the lemon trees in blossom, manners more honest and the wine more pure. And so the family from San Francisco decided to set off with all their trunks for Capri to look it over, to tread on the stones at the sites of Tiberius’s palaces, visit the fabulous caves of the Blue Grotto, and listen to the Abruzzian bagpipers who roam all over the island for a whole month before Christmas singing praises to the Virgin Mary; then they were to move to Sorrento.","And so, early-morning quarrels began to break out between the Gentleman from San Francisco and his wife; and their daughter now grew pale and suffered from headaches, and now became animated, enthusiastic over everything, and at such times was lovely and beautiful. Beautiful were the tender, complex feelings which her meeting with the ungainly man aroused in her, —— the man in whose veins flowed unusual blood, for, after all, it does not matter what in particular stirs up a maiden's soul: money, or fame, or nobility of birth . . . Everybody assured the tourists that it was quite different at Sorrento and on Capri, that lemon-trees were blossoming there, that it was warmer and sunnier there, the morals purer, and the wine less adulterated. And the family from San Francisco decided to set out with all their luggage for Capri. They planned to settle down at Sorrento, but first to visit the island, tread the stones where stood Tiberius's palaces, examine the fabulous wonders of the Blue Grotto, and listen to the bagpipes [sic] of Abruzzi, who roam about the island during the whole month preceding Christmas and sing the praises of the Madona [sic]."
"По вечерам этажи «Атлантиды» зияли во мраке как бы огненными несметными глазами, и великое множество слуг работало в поварских, судомойнях и винных подвалах. Океан, ходивший за стенами, был страшен, но о нем не думали, твердо веря во власть над ним командира, рыжего человека чудовищной величины и грузности, всегда как бы сонного, похожего в своем мундире, с широкими золотыми нашивками на огромного идола и очень редко появлявшегося на люди из своих таинственных покоев; на баке поминутно взвывала с адской мрачностью и взвизгивала с неистовой злобой сирена, но немногие из обедающих слышали сирену – ее заглушали звуки прекрасного струнного оркестра, изысканно и неустанно игравшего в мраморной двусветной зале, устланной бархатными коврами, празднично залитой огнями, переполненной декольтированными дамами и мужчинами во фраках и смокингах, стройными лакеями и почтительными метрдотелями, среди которых один, тот, что принимал заказы только на вина, ходил даже с цепью на шее, как какой-нибудь лорд-мэр. Смокинг и крахмальное белье очень молодили господина из СанФранциско. Сухой, невысокий, неладно скроенный, но крепко сшитый, расчищенный до глянца и в меру оживленный, он сидел в золотисто-жемчужном сиянии этого чертога за бутылкой янтарного иоганисберга, за бокалами и бокальчиками тончайшего стекла, за кудрявым букетом гиацинтов. Нечто монгольское было в его желтоватом лице с подстриженными серебряными усами, золотыми пломбами блестели его крупные зубы, старой слоновой костью – крепкая лысая голова. Богато, но по годам была одета его жена, женщина крупная, широкая и спокойная; сложно, но легко и прозрачно, с невинной откровенностью – дочь, высокая, тонкая, с великолепными волосами, прелестно убранными, с ароматическим от фиалковых лепешечек дыханием и с нежнейшими розовыми прыщиками возле губ и между лопаток, чуть припудренных… Обед длился больше часа, а после обеда открывались в бальной зале танцы, во время которых мужчины, – в том числе, конечно, и господин из Сан-Франциско, – задрав ноги, решали на основании последних биржевых новостей судьбы народов, до малиновой красноты накуривались гаванскими сигарами и напивались ликерами в баре, где служили негры в красных камзолах, с белками, похожими на облупленные крутые яйца.","In the evenings, the floors of the Atlantis gaped in the darkness as if with fiery countless eyes, and a great many servants worked in the cooks, scullery and wine cellars. The ocean that went beyond the walls was terrible, but they did not think about it, firmly believing in the power over it of the commander, a red-haired man of monstrous size and weight, always as if sleepy, similar in his uniform, with wide gold stripes to a huge idol and very rarely appearing to people from his mysterious chambers; a siren on the forecastle kept screaming with hellish gloominess and squealing with furious malice, but few of the diners heard the siren - it was drowned out by the sounds of a beautiful string orchestra, exquisitely and tirelessly playing in a double-height marble hall, lined with velvet carpets, festively flooded with lights, overflowing with low-cut ladies and men in tailcoats and tuxedos, slender footmen and respectful maître d's, among which one, the one who took orders only for wine, even walked around with a chain around his neck, like some kind of lord mayor. The tuxedo and starched underwear made the gentleman from San Francisco very young. Dry, short, oddly cut, but strongly tailored, polished to a gloss and moderately lively, he sat in the golden-pearl radiance of this hall behind a bottle of amber Joganisberg, behind glasses and goblets of the finest glass, behind a curly bouquet of hyacinths. There was something Mongolian in his yellowish face with trimmed silver mustaches, his large teeth glittered with gold fillings, his strong bald head was old ivory. Richly, but according to the years, his wife was dressed, a woman large, wide and calm; complicated, but light and transparent, with innocent frankness - a daughter, tall, thin, with magnificent hair, charmingly done up, with aromatic breath from violet cakes and with the most delicate pink pimples near her lips and between her shoulder blades, slightly powdered ... Dinner lasted more than an hour, and after dinner, dances opened in the ballroom, during which men - including, of course, the gentleman from San Francisco - with their legs up, decided the fate of peoples on the basis of the latest stock exchange news, smoked Havana cigars to crimson redness and drank liqueurs in a bar where Negroes in red camisoles served, with squirrels like peeled hard-boiled eggs.","In the evening, the tiers of the Atlantis yawned in the darkness as with innumerable fiery eyes, and a multitude of servants in the kitchens, sculleries, wine-cellars, worked with a special frenzy. The ocean heaving beyond was terrible, but no one thought of it, firmly believing in the captain's power over it. The captain was a ginger-haired man of monstrous size and weight, apparently always torpid, who looked in his uniform with broad gold stripes very like a huge idol, and who rarely emerged from his mysterious chambers to show himself to the passengers. Every minute the siren howled from the bows with hellish moroseness, and screamed with fury, but few diners heard it--it was drowned by the sounds of an excellent string band, exquisitely and untiringly playing in the huge two-tiered hall that was decorated with marble and covered with velvet carpets, flooded with feasts of light from crystal chandeliers and gilded girandoles, and crowded with ladies in bare shoulders and jewels, with men in dinner-jackets, elegant waiters and respectful maîtres d'hôtel, one of whom, he who took the wine-orders only, wore a chain round his neck like a lord mayor. Dinner-jacket and perfect linen made the Gentleman from San Francisco look much younger. Dry, of small stature, badly built but strongly made, polished to a glow and in due measure animated, he sat in the golden-pearly radiance of this palace, with a bottle of amber Johannisberg at his hand, and glasses, large and small, of delicate crystal, and a curly bunch of fresh hyacinths. There was something Mongolian in his yellowish face with its trimmed silvery moustache, large teeth blazing with gold, and strong bald head blazing like old ivory. Richly dressed, but in keeping with her age, sat his wife, a big, broad, quiet woman. Intricately, but lightly and transparently dressed, with an innocent immodesty, sat his daughter, tall, slim, her magnificent hair splendidly done, her breath fragrant with violet cachous, and the tenderest little rosy moles showing near her lip and between her bare, slightly powdered shoulder blades. The dinner lasted two whole hours, to be followed by dancing in the ball-room, whence the men, including, of course, the Gentleman from San Francisco, proceeded to the bar ; there, with their feet cocked up on the tables, they settled the destinies of nations in the course of their political and stock-exchange conversations, smoking meanwhile Havana cigars and drinking liqueurs till they were crimson in the face, waited on all the while by negroes in red jackets with eyes like peeled, hard-boiled eggs.","In the evenings the portholes on the many decks of the Atlantis stared into the darkness like countless fiery eyes, and a great multitude of servants worked in the kitchens, sculleries and wine-stores. The ocean running outside was awesome, but no one gave it a thought, firmly trusting to the power exercised over it by the captain, a red-haired man of monstrous height and weight who always seemed half-asleep; in his uniform with its heavy gold braid he looked like an enormous idol, and very rarely emerged from his mysterious quarters to show himself to the passengers. Every few minutes a siren on the forecastle would emit moans of infernal despair or yelp with frenzied malice, but very few of the diners heard that siren, muffled as it was by the sound of a fine string orchestra playing elegantly and tirelessly in the two-toned dining-room which was suffused with a festive light and packed with décolleté ladies, men in tails and dinner-jackets, slender waiters and polite maîtres d’hôtel, one of whom, the one who took orders only for wine, even paraded with a chain round his neck, like a lord mayor. The gentleman from San Francisco’s dinner-jacket and starched linen made him look much younger. Dry, short, wrongly cut but firmly sewn, he sat in the pearly-gold radiance of that palatial dining-room behind a bottle of wine, a whole row of delicate glasses and a lush display of hyacinths. There was something Mongolian about his sallow face with its trimmed silvery moustache; his big teeth gleamed with gold fillings and his strong bald head glistened like old ivory. His wife, a large, solid, reserved woman, was attired expensively, but appropriately for her age; his daughter, tall and slender with magnificent, superbly coiffured hair, breath redolent of violet water and the tiniest of pink pimples by her lips and between her lightly powdered shoulder-blades, wore a dress which was elaborate but light, transparent and innocently revealing. Dinner lasted over an hour, and after dinner the ballroom offered dancing; during this the men, including of course the gentleman from San Francisco, put their feet up, smoked Havana cigars until their faces grew crimson and drank liqueurs from the bar manned by negroes in red waistcoats and with eyes like shelled hard-boiled eggs.","In the evening, all the decks of the ""Atlantis"" yawned in the darkness, shone with their innumerable fiery eyes, and a multitude of servants worked with increased feverishness in the kitchens, dish-washing compartments, and wine-cellars. The ocean, which heaved about the sides of the ship, was dreadful, but no one thought of it. All had faith in the controlling power, of the captain, a red-headed giant, heavy and very sleepy, who, clad in a uniform with broad golden stripes, looked like a huge idol, and but rarely emerged, for the benefit of the public, from his mysterious retreat. On the fore-castle, the siren gloomily roared or screeched in a fit of mad rage, but few of the diners heard the siren: its hellish voice was covered by the sounds of anexcellent string orchestra, which played ceaselessly and exquisitely in a vast hall, decorated with marble and spread with velvety carpets. The hall was flooded with torrents of light, radiated by crystal lustres and gilt chandeliers; it was filled with a throng of bejeweled ladies in low-necked dresses, of men in dinner-coats, graceful waiters, and deferential ma�es-d 'h�. One of these, —— who accepted wine orders exclusively —— wore a chain on his neck like some lord-mayor. The evening dress, and the ideal linen made the Gentleman from San Francisco look very young. Dry-skinned, of average height, strongly, though irregularly built, glossy with thorough washing and cleaning, and moderately animated, he sat in the golden splendor of this palace. Near him stood a bottle of amber-colored Johannisberg, and goblets of most delicate glass and of varied sizes, surmounted by a frizzled bunch of fresh hyacinths. There was something Mongolian in his yellowish face with its trimmed silvery moustache; his large teeth glimmered with gold fillings, and his strong, bald head had a dull glow, like old ivory. His wife, a big, broad and placid woman, was dressed richly, but in keeping with her age. Complicated, but light, transparent, and innocently immodest was the dress of his daughter, tall and slender, with magnificent hair gracefully combed; her breath was sweet with violet-scented tablets, and she had a number of tiny and most delicate pink dimples near her lips and between her slightly-powdered shoulder blades. . . The dinner lasted two whole hours, and was followed by dances in the dancing hall, while the men —— the Gentleman from San Francisco among them —— made their way to the refreshment bar, where negros in red jackets and with eye-balls like shelled hard-boiled eggs, waited on them. There, with their feet on tables, smoking Havana cigars, and drinking themselves purple in the face, they settled the destinies of nations on the basis of the latest political and stock-exchange news."
"Остров Капри был сыр и темен в этот вечер. Но тут он на минуту ожил, кое-где осветился. На верху горы, на площадке фуникулера, уже опять стояла толпа тех, на обязанности которых лежало достойно принять господина из Сан-Франциско. Были и другие приезжие, но не заслуживающие внимания, – несколько русских, поселившихся на Капри, неряшливых и рассеянных, в очках, с бородами, с поднятыми воротниками стареньких пальтишек, и компания длинноногих, круглоголовых немецких юношей в тирольских костюмах и с холщовыми сумками за плечами, не нуждающихся ни в чьих услугах, всюду чувствующих себя как дома и совсем не щедрых на траты. Господин же из Сан-Франциско, спокойно сторонившийся и от тех и от других, был сразу замечен. Ему и его дамам торопливо помогли выйти, перед ним побежали вперед, указывая дорогу, его снова окружили мальчишки и те дюжие каприйские бабы, что носят на головах чемоданы и сундуки порядочных туристов. Застучали по маленькой, точно оперной площади, над которой качался от влажного ветра электрический шар, их деревянные ножные скамеечки, по-птичьему засвистала и закувыркалась через голову орава мальчишек – и как по сцене пошел среди них господин из Сан-Франциско к какой-то средневековой арке под слитыми в одно домами, за которой покато вела к сияющему впереди подъезду отеля звонкая уличка с вихром пальмы над плоскими крышами налево и синими звездами на черном небе вверху, впереди. И опять было похоже, что это в честь гостей из Сан-Франциско ожил каменный сырой городок на скалистом островке в Средиземном море, что это они сделали таким счастливым и радушным хозяина отеля, что только их ждал китайский гонг, завывший по всем этажам сбор к обеду, едва вступили они в вестибюль.","The island of Capri was damp and dark tonight. But then he came to life for a moment, lit up in some places. On the top of the mountain, on the platform of the funicular, there was again a crowd of those whose duty it was to worthily receive the gentleman from San Francisco. There were other visitors, but not worthy of attention - a few Russians who settled in Capri, slovenly and absent-minded, with glasses, beards, with the collars of old coats turned up, and a company of long-legged, round-headed German youths in Tyrolean suits and with canvas bags over their shoulders. , who do not need anyone's services, feel at home everywhere and are not at all generous in spending. The gentleman from San Francisco, who calmly kept aloof from both, was immediately noticed. He and his ladies were hurriedly helped out, they ran ahead of him, showing the way, he was again surrounded by boys and those hefty Capri women who carry suitcases and chests of respectable tourists on their heads. There was a pounding in the small square, like an opera square, over which an electric ball swayed from the damp wind, their wooden footstools whistled like a bird and tumbled over the head of a crowd of boys - and how a gentleman from San Francisco walked along the stage among them to some medieval an arch under the houses merged into one, behind which a ringing street led slopingly to the hotel entrance shining ahead with a swirl of palm trees over flat roofs to the left and blue stars in the black sky above, in front. And again it seemed that it was in honor of the guests from San Francisco that a damp stone town on a rocky island in the Mediterranean came to life, that it was they who made the owner of the hotel so happy and hospitable that only a Chinese gong was waiting for them, howling on all floors of the gathering for dinner as soon as they entered the lobby.","The island of Capri was damp and dark that evening. For the moment, however, it had revived, and was lighted up here and there as usual at the hour of the steamer's arrival. At the top of the ascent, on the little piazza by the funicular station stood the crowd of those whose duty it was to receive with propriety the luggage of the Gentleman from San Francisco. There were other arrivals too, but none worthy of notice: a few Russians who had settled in Capri, untidy and absent-minded owing to their bookish thoughts, spectacled, bearded, half-buried in the upturned collars of their thick woollen overcoats. Then a group of long-legged, long-necked, round-headed German youths in Tirolese costumes, with knapsacks over their shoulders, needing no assistance, feeling everywhere at home and always economical in tips. The Gentleman from San Francisco, who kept quietly apart from both groups, was marked out at once. He and his ladies were hastily assisted from the car, men ran in front to show them the way, and they set off on foot, surrounded by urchins and by the sturdy Capri women who carry on their heads the luggage of decent travellers. Across the piazza, that looked like an opera scene in the light of the electric globe that swung aloft in the damp wind, clacked the wooden pattens of the women-porters. The gang of urchins began to whistle to the Gentleman from San Francisco, and to turn somersaults around him, whilst he, as if on the stage, marched among them towards a mediæval archway and under huddled houses, behind which led a little echoing lane, past tufts of palm-trees showing above the flat roofs to the left, and under the stars in the dark blue sky, upwards towards the shining entrance of the hotel.... And again it seemed as if purely in honour of the guests from San Francisco the damp little town on the rocky little island of the Mediterranean had revived from its evening stupor, that their arrival alone had made the hotel proprietor so happy and hearty, and that for them had been waiting the Chinese gong which sent its howlings through all the house the moment they crossed the doorstep.","The island of Capri was wet and dark that evening. But it momentarily revived and brightened up in places. At the top of the mountain, on the funicular’s arrival platform, a throng of those to whom it had fallen to offer a fitting welcome to the gentleman from San Francisco already stood in wait. There were other arrivals too, but none worthy of attention – a few Russians who had settled on Capri, slovenly, bearded and absent-minded men in glasses and with the collars of their worn overcoats turned up, and a band of long-legged, round-headed German youths in Tyrolean costumes, with knapsacks on their backs; they had no need of anyone’s services and were decidedly unfree with their money. The gentleman from San Francisco, who calmly kept his distance from both these groups, was immediately marked. He and his ladies were quickly helped to alight, people ran ahead to show them the way, and once again he found himself surrounded by urchins and those sturdy Capriote peasant-women who carry the cases and trunks of respectable tourists on their heads. Their wooden soles clattered across the tiny, operatic square, above which an electric globe swung in the moist wind , the horde of urchins whistled like birds and turned somersaults while the gentleman from San Francisco walked in their midst as though across a stage towards a medieval archway under a group of houses which seemed to merge into one another; beyond the archway the brightly lit entrance to the hotel was approached uphill by a tiny ringing street, with a fringe of palm trees visible above flat roofs to the left and the blue stars standing out against the black sky above and ahead. And it was as if everything in the wet little stone town on that rocky Mediterranean island had revived specifically in honour of the visitors from San Francisco , it seemed that it was they who had made the proprietor of the hotel so happy and welcoming and that it was only they who had been awaited by the Chinese gong which sent its summons to dinner booming through every floor just as they entered the vestibule.","The Island of Capri was dark and damp on that evening. But for a while it grew animated and let up, in spots, as always in the hour of the steamer's arrival. On the top of the hill, at the station of the funiculaire, there stood already the crowd of those whose duty it was to receive properly the Gentleman from San Francisco. The rest of the tourists hardly deserved any attention. There were a few Russians, who had settled on Capri, untidy, absent-minded people, absorbed in their bookishthoughts, spectacled, bearded, with the collars of their cloth overcoats raised. There was also a company of long-legged, long-necked, round-headed German youths in Tyrolean costume, and with linen bags on their backs, who need no one's services, are everywhere at home, and are by no means liberal in their expenses. The Gentleman from San Francisco, who quietly kept aloof from both the Russians and the Germans, was noticed at once. He and his ladies were hurriedly helped from the car, a man ran before them to show them the way, and they were again surrounded by boys and those thickset Caprean peasant women, who carry on their heads the trunks and valises of wealthy travelers. Their tiny, wooden, foot-stools rapped against the pavement of the small square, which looked almost like an opera square, and over which an electric lantern swung in the damp wind; the gang of urchins whistled like birds and turned somersaults, and as the Gentleman from San Francisco passed among them, it all looked like a stage scene; he went first under some kind of mediaeval archway, beneath houses huddled close together, and then along a steep echoing lane which led to the hotel entrance, flooded with light. At the left, a palm tree raised its tuft above the flat roofs, and higher up, blue stars burned in the black sky. And again things looked as though it was in honor of the guests from San Francisco that the stony damp little town had awakened on its rocky island in the Mediterranean, that it was they who had made the owner of the hotel so happy and beaming, and that the Chinese gong, which had sounded the call to dinner through all the floors as soon as they entered the lobby, had been waiting only for them."
"Ночью весь отель спал. Открыли окно в сорок третьем номере, – оно выходило в угол сада, где под высокой каменной стеной, утыканной по гребню битым стеклом, рос чахлый банан, – потушили электричество, заперли дверь на ключ и ушли. Мертвый остался в темноте, синие звезды глядели на него с неба, сверчок с грустной беззаботностью запел в стене… В тускло освещенном коридоре сидели на подоконнике две горничные, что-то штопая Вошел Луиджи с кучей платья на руке, в туфлях.","The entire hotel was asleep at night. They opened the window in the forty-third room - it looked out into the corner of the garden, where a stunted banana grew under a high stone wall, studded along the ridge with broken glass - they put out the electricity, locked the door with a key and left. The dead man remained in the dark, blue stars looked at him from the sky, a cricket sang with sad carelessness in the wall ... In the dimly lit corridor, two maids sat on the windowsill, darning something. Luigi entered with a bunch of dresses on his arm, in shoes.","The whole hotel was asleep. The window of No. 43 was open, on to a corner of the garden where, under a high stone wall ridged with broken glass, grew a battered banana tree. The light was turned off, the door locked, the room deserted. The deceased remained in the darkness, blue stars glanced at him from the black sky, a cricket started to chirp with sad carelessness in the wall.... Out in the dimly-lit corridor two chambermaids were seated in a window-sill, mending something. Entered Luigi, in slippers, with a heap of clothes in his hand.","That night the whole hotel slept. Someone opened the window of room 43 – it looked out onto a corner of the garden where a puny banana tree grew against a high stone wall topped with broken glass – turned off the electric light, locked the door and went away. The dead man lay in darkness; the blue stars watched him from the sky, and a cricket on the wall began to chirrup with sad abandon … Out in the dimly lit corridor two chambermaids sat on a window-sill darning. Luigi entered in his slippers, with a pile of linen over one arm. ‘Pronto?’",". . By night, the whole hotel was asleep. A waiter opened the window in Number 43 —— it faced a corner of the garden where a consumptive banana-tree grew in the shadow of a high stone wall set with broken glass on the top —— turned out the electric light, locked the door, and went away. The deceased remained alone in the darkness. Blue stars looked down at him from the black sky, the cricket in the wall started his melancholy, care-free song. In the dimly lighted corridor two chambermaids were sitting on the window-sill, mending something. Then Luigi came in, in slippered feet, with a heap of clothes on his arm."
– Через пять минут! – звонко и уже весело отозвался из-за двери девичий голос.,- In five minutes! - a girl's voice answered loudly and already cheerfully from behind the door.,"""In five minutes, Dad,"" came the gay voice of the girl from behind the door.","‘Five minutes,’ tinkled an already merry, girlish voice the other side of the door.","""In five minutes, papa!"" answered cheerfully and gaily a girlish voice."
"Мисс, все время странно смотревшая на него, села на стул и, зажав рот платком, зарыдала. У миссис слезы сразу высохли, лицо вспыхнуло Она подняла тон, стала требовать, говоря на своем языке и вое еще не веря, что уважение к ним окончательно потеряно. Хозяин с вежливым достоинством осадил ее: если мадам не нравятся порядки отеля, он не смеет ее задерживать; и твердо заявил, что тело должно быть вывезено сегодня же на рассвете, что полиции уже дано знать, что представитель ее сейчас явится и исполнит необходимые формальности… Можно ли достать на Капри хотя бы простой готовый гроб, спрашивает мадам? К сожалению, нет, ни в каком случае, а сделать никто не успеет.

The owner, with polite dignity, reined in her: if Madame does not like the order of the hotel, he does not dare to detain her; and firmly stated that the body should be taken out this very day at dawn, that the police had already been given to know that their representative would immediately appear and carry out the necessary formalities ...
