"Господин завозился над лужею, подбирая антоновки; пальто его распахнулось; он, очевидно, кряхтел; затворяя калитку, он вновь едва не рассыпал покупочки. Господин приблизился к дачке по садовой желтой дорожке между двух рядов в ветре изогнутых кустиков; распространилась вокруг та гнетущая знакомая атмосфера; покрытая шапкой с наушниками, круто как-то на грудь оседала зловещая голова; глубоко в орбитах сидящие глазки на этот раз не бегали вовсе (как бегали они перед всяким пристальным взором); глубоко сидящие глазки устало уставились в стекла. Александр Иванович успел подсмотреть в этих глазках (представьте себе!) какую-то особую, свою радость, смешанную с усталостью и печалью – чисто животную радость: отогреться, выспаться и плотно поужинать после стольких перенесенных трудов. Так зверь кровожадный: возвращаясь в берлогу, кажется зверь кровожадный домашним и кротким, обнаружив беззлобие, на какое способен и он; дружелюбно обнюхивает тогда этот зверь свою самку; и облизывает заскуливших щенят.","The gentleman fussed over the puddle, picking up Antonovkas; his coat was flung open; he was obviously groaning; shutting the gate, he again almost scattered the purchases. The gentleman approached the dacha along a yellow garden path between two rows of curved bushes in the wind; spread around that oppressive familiar atmosphere; covered with a hat with headphones, an ominous head somehow settled abruptly on the chest; deep in their orbits, the little eyes, which were set in their sockets, did not run at all this time (as they did before any intent gaze); deep-set eyes stared tiredly into the glass. Alexander Ivanovich managed to peep in those eyes (imagine!) some special, his own joy, mixed with fatigue and sadness - a purely animal joy: to warm up, sleep and have a hearty dinner after so many endured labors. So is the bloodthirsty beast: returning to the den, the bloodthirsty beast seems to be domestic and meek, revealing the malice that he is capable of; friendly then this animal sniffs its female; and licks whining puppies.","From under an arm a bag fell toward a mud puddle; the paper tore and Antonov apples rolled in the mud. A sinister head covered by a cap with ear-flaps was settled on the chest. The deep-set little eyes did not dart, but wearily fixed on the window panes. And Alexander Ivanovich managed to detect (just imagine!) joy, the animal joy of having supper after travails endured. Thus a beast, upon returning to its lair, seems meek, and displays the benignity of which it is capable. It amiably sniffs at its mate and licks its cubs.","The gentleman fussed about over the puddle, gathering up the apples; his overcoat fell open; he was breathing with obvious difficulty; as he closed the gate, he all but shed his purchases again. The gentleman approached the cottage along the yellow garden path between two rows of bushes, bending in the wind; a familiar oppressive atmosphere spread all round; his sinister head, covered by a hat with ear-flaps, was drooping acutely on to his chest; his deep-set eyes on this occasion were not wandering at all (as they did before any intensive scrutiny); the deep-set eyes gazed wearily at the window. Alexandr Ivanovich was able to glimpse in those eyes (can you imagine!) a certain special, personal joy, mixed with tiredness and sadness—a purely animal joy at the prospect of getting warmed through, having a sound sleep and a good supper after so many exertions.

Why, at the news of her return, the usual pursing of dry lips broke into an excited and angry trembling of the jaws (last night - during a conversation with Nikolenka); why didn't you sleep at night? Why did that anger evaporate somewhere in the course of half a day and give way to aching melancholy, turning into anxiety? Why couldn't he stand the wait himself, why did he go to the hotel? Persuaded - himself: himself - brought. What happened there - in the hotel room; Anna Petrovna also forgot her strict promise: she made this promise to herself - here, yesterday: here in the lacquered house (having visited it and found no one).",Indeed! Anna Petrovna and Apollon Apollonovich had both been agitated by their little talk. And on entering the lacquered house they did not exchange any outpourings of feelings.,"An unexpected, unanticipated fact: it was two-and-a-half years since Anna Petrovna had left her husband for an Italian singer; and now two-and-a-half years later, abandoned by the Italian singer, she had come hastening back by express train, from the beautiful palaces of Granada across the range of the Pyrenees, through the Alps, through the mountains of the Tyrol; but what was most astonishing of all was that the senator could not bring himself to breathe a word about Anna Petrovna not only for the past two years and more, but even a mere two-and-a-half days ago (even the day before he had bridled at it!); for two-and-a-half years Apollon Apollonovich had consciously avoided the very thought of Anna Petrovna (and all the same he did think of her); the very sound combination “Anna Petrovna” had struck his ear-drums just as a paper pellet, flicked from under a desk, strikes the forehead of a teacher; except that the schoolteacher will then hammer on the desk with his fist in anger; whereas Apollon Apollonovich would merely compress his lips in disdain at this combination of sounds. So why was it that at the news of her return the usual compression of the lips burst out into an angry and agitated trembling of the jaws (the night before—during his conversation with Nikolenka) : why had he not slept that night? Why, in the course of a single day, had that anger dissipated and been replaced by an ache of longing that turned into alarm? Why could he not bear the anticipation, but went to the hotel himself? He talked her round—himself: he brought her home—himself. What was it that had happened there in the hotel room; Anna Petrovna had also forgotten her earnest promise: she had made that promise to herself—here, the day before: here in the lacquered house (when she visited it and found no one at home).","A sudden, unforeseen fact: it was about two and a half years ago that Anna Petrovna left her husband for an Italian artiste; and now, two and a half years later, deserted by the Italian artiste, from the splendid palaces of Granada across the chain of the Pyrenees, across the Alps, across the mountains of the Tyrol, she came rushing back in an express train; but what was more remarkable was that the senator had found it impossible to breathe a word about Anna Petrovna not only for the past two and a half years, but even two and a half days ago (only yesterday he had bristled up!); for two and a half years Apollon Apollonovich had avoided even the thought of Anna Petrovna (and yet had thought about her); the very sound-combination ‘Anna Petrovna’ broke against his eardrums like a firecracker thrown at a teacher from under a school desk; except that a schoolteacher would bang his fist angrily on the desk; while Apollon Apollonovich merely tightened his lips contemptuously at this sound combination. But why at the news of her return did the customary tightening of his dry lips burst apart in an agitatedly wrathful trembling of the jaws (the night before – during his conversation with Nikolenka); why had he not been able to sleep that night? Why for a period of some twelve hours had that anger evaporated somewhere and been replaced by an aching anguish, bordering on anxiety? Why had he not been able to endure the wait , himself gone to the hotel? Had talked her round; brought her home. Something had happened there – in the hotel room; Anna Petrovna had forgotten her stern promise: she had made that promise to herself – here, yesterday: here in the lacquered house (having visited it and found no one at home)."

"Перед ней мелькнула любовь этого несчастного лета; и любовь несчастного лета, как все, отвалилась от памяти; и опять раздался удар, раздробляющий камни. Промелькнувши, упали: весенние разговоры ее с Nicolas Аблеуховым; промелькнувши, упали: годы замужества, свадьба: некая пустота отрывала, глотая, кусок за куском. И неслись удары металла, дробящие камень. Вся жизнь промелькнула, и упала вся жизнь, будто не было еще никогда ее жизни и будто сама она – нерожденная в жизнь душа. Некая пустота начиналась у нее непосредственно за спиною (потому что все провалилось там, ударившись в некое дно); пустота продолжалась в века, а в веках слышался лишь удар за ударом: то, слетая в некое дно, упадали куски ее жизней. Точно некий металлический конь, звонко цокая в камень, у нее за спиной порастаптывал отлетевшее; точно там за спиною, звонко цокая в камень, погнался за нею металлический всадник.","The love of that unfortunate summer flashed before her; and the love of the unfortunate summer, like everything else, fell away from memory; and again there was a blow, crushing the stones.

Her whole life flashed by, her whole life fell away, and her life had not yet existed, ever, and it was as if she had not been born into life. The void began immediately behind her back (everything had collapsed there), and the void continued on into the ages. In the ages only crash upon crash could be heard: pieces of lives were falling.

"Был еще один посетитель Софьи Петровны Лихутиной; офицер: Сергей Сергеевич Лихутин; собственно говоря, это был ее муж; он заведовал где-то там провиантом; рано поутру уходил он из дому; появлялся дома не ранее полуночи; одинаково кротко здоровался просто с гостями и с гостями так сказать, с одинаковой кротостью говорил для приличия фифку, опуская в кружку двугривенный (если были при этом граф Авен или барон Оммау-Оммергау), или скромно кивал головой на слова «революция – эволюция», выпивал чашку чая и шел в свою комнату; молодые светские люди про себя его называли армейчиком, а учащаяся молодежь – офицером-бурбоном (в девятьсот пятом году Сергей Сергеич имел несчастие защищать от рабочих своей полуротою Николаевский Мост). Собственно говоря, Сергей Сергеич Лихутин охотнее всего воздержался бы и от фифок, и от слов «революция – эволюция». Собственно говоря, он не прочь был бы попасть к баронессе на спиритический сеансик; но о своем скромном желании на правах мужа вовсе он не настаивал, ибо вовсе он не был деспотом по отношению к Софье Петровне: Софью Петровну любил он всею силой души; более того: два с половиною года тому назад он женился на ней вопреки желанью родителей, богатейших симбирских помещиков; с той поры он был проклят отцом и лишен состояния; с той поры для всех неожиданно скромно он поступил в Григорийский полк.","There was another visitor to Sofya Petrovna Likhutina; officer: Sergey Sergeevich Likhutin; as a matter of fact, it was her husband; he was in charge of provisions somewhere; early in the morning he left the house; appeared at home not earlier than midnight; He greeted the guests simply with the same meekness and with the guests, so to speak, with the same meekness he spoke a fifka for decency, dropping a two-kopeck coin into a mug (if there were Count Aven or Baron Ommau-Ommergau at the same time), or modestly nodded his head at the words ""revolution - evolution"", drank a cup of tea and went to his room; young secular people silently called him an army man, and young students called him a bourbon officer (in the year 1905, Sergei Sergeyevich had the misfortune to defend the Nikolaev Bridge from the workers with his half-company). Strictly speaking, Sergey Sergeevich Likhutin would most willingly refrain from fifoks and from the words ""revolution - evolution."" As a matter of fact, he would not have been averse to getting to the baroness for a seance; but he did not at all insist on his modest desire for the rights of a husband, for he was by no means a despot in relation to Sofya Petrovna: he loved Sofya Petrovna with all the strength of his soul; moreover: two and a half years ago he married her against the wishes of his parents, the richest Simbirsk landowners; from that time on he was cursed by his father and deprived of his fortune; from that time on, unexpectedly modestly for everyone, he entered the Gregory regiment.","He left the house early in the morning; he appeared no earlier than midnight. He made a simple exchange of greetings with the guests; for propriety’s sake he meekly uttered a “phoophoo,” dropping in a twenty-copeck piece (if Count Aven or Ommau-Ommergau was there), or modestly nodded his head at the words “revolution-evolution,” drank a cup of tea, and—off he went to his room. The men about town called him that army type, and the young students, the Prussian. Sergei Sergeyevich Likhutin would gladly have done without both “phoophoos” and the words “revolution-evolution.” He would not have been averse to going to the Baroness for some spiritualism, but he did not use his position as a husband to insist on it: he was no despot with Sofia Petrovna. Two and a half years earlier he had married her against the wishes of his parents, very wealthy landowners. As a result, he had been cursed by his father and deprived of his inheritance.","Sofia Petrovna Likhutina had one further visitor; the officer: Sergei Sergeevich Likhutin; to tell the truth, he was her husband; he was in charge of provisions somewhere out there; he left the house early in the morning; and appeared at home no earlier than midnight; he greeted equally meekly both the guests and the guests so-to-speak, with equal meekness he told a whiffy for decency’s sake, dropping a twenty-copeck coin into the tankard (if Count Aven or Baron Ommau-Ommergau was present), or he modestly nodded at the words “revolution—evolution”, drank a cup of tea and went to his room; among themselves the young men-of-the-world called him the conscript, and the students—the martinet (in 1905 Sergei Sergeich had the misfortune to defend the Nikolaevskii Bridge from the workers with his half-company). In truth, Sergei Sergeich would have preferred to refrain both from whiffies and from the words “revolution—evolution”. In truth, he wouldn’t have minded going to a nice spiritualist séance at the Baroness’; but he did not use his status as her husband to insist on this modest wish, since he was by no means a despot in his relations with Sofia Petrovna: he loved Sofia Petrovna with all his soul; more than that: two-and-a-half years before he had married her against the wishes of his parents, immensely wealthy landowners from Simbirsk; and since that time he had been cursed by his father and deprived of his inheritance; since that time he had astonished everyone by modestly entering the Gr…skii regiment.","Sofya Petrovna Likhutina had yet one more visitor; an officer: Sergei Sergeyevich Likhutin ; as a matter of fact, he was her husband; he was in charge of provisions somewhere out there; early in the morning he left the house; reappeared no earlier than midnight; equally meekly greeted the ordinary guests and the guests-so-to-speak, with equal meekness said a ‘fifi’ for the sake of propriety, dropping a twenty-copeck piece into the collection box (if Count Aven or Baron Ommau-Ommergau were present at the time), or modestly nodded his head at the words ‘revolution-evolution’, drank a cup of tea and went to his little room ; the young men of polite society privately called him ‘the little army fellow’, while the studying youth called him ‘the Bourbon officer’ (in 1905 Sergei Sergeyevich had had the misfortune to defend the Nikolayevsky Bridge from the workers with his half-company). As a matter of fact, Sergei Sergeich Likhutin would have been best pleased to abstain both from ‘fifis’ and from the words ‘revolution-evolution’. As a matter of fact, he would not have been averse to going to the baroness’s for a little spiritualist seance; but he made absolutely no attempt to insist on his modest wish by using his rights as a husband, for in absolutely no way was he a despot in relation to Sofya Petrovna; he loved Sofya Petrovna with all the strength of his soul; moreover: two and a half years earlier he had married her against the wishes of his parents, very rich landowners in Simbirsk; after that, he had been cursed by his father and deprived of his fortune; after that, to everyone’s surprise, he had entered the Gregorian Regiment.10"

His obverse—an abracadabra dream, Enfranshish; and that dream undoubtedly came from vodka.

"Тут, попутно, заметил он часовой механизм, приделанный сбоку: надо было сбоку вертеть металлическим ключиком, чтобы острая черная стрелка стала на назначенный час. Николай Аполлонович глухо почувствовал встающую в его сознании уверенность, долженствующую доказать его дрянность и слабость: он почувствовал, что повернуть этот ключик никогда он не сможет, ибо не было средств остановить пущенный в ход механизм.

Неназойливо они проникали в блестящий газами круг и казались барышням гибче воска; и глядишь – там, здесь – пуховой легкий веер начинал уже биться о грудь усатого гения, как доверчиво на эту грудь севшее бабочкино крыло, и крепкогрудый гусар осторожно начинал с барышней перекидываться своими пустыми намеками; с точно такою же осторожностью наклоняем лицо мы к севшему невзначай нам на палец легкому мотыльку.

Наконец, раздался долгожданный робкий звонок; распахнулась дверь добела освещенного зала, и туго затянутый во фрак свой тапер, напоминая черную, голенастую птицу, потирая руки, едва не споткнулся о проходящего официанта (приглашенного по случаю бала в этот блещущий дом); в руках у официанта задребезжал, задрожал лист картона, сплошь усеянный котильонными побрякушками: орденками, лентами и бубенчиками. Скромный тапер разложил ряды нотных тетрадок, поднимал и опускал рояльную крышку, обдувал бережно клавиши и без видимой цели блещущей своею ботинкой нажимал он педаль, напоминая исправного паровозного машиниста за пробою паровозных котлов перед отправлением поезда. Убедившись в исправности инструмента, скромный тапер подобрал фалды фрака, опустился на низенький табурет, откинулся корпусом, уронил на клавиши пальцы, на мгновение замер, – и громозвучный аккорд сотряс стены: точно был подан свисток, призывающий к дальнему путешествию.","These cute blond creatures were in gauze dresses and silver shoes. Already from nine o'clock they waved fluffy fans at their father, at the housekeeper, at the maid, even ... at the venerable zemstvo leader of mastodon-like dimensions (Koko's relative) who was visiting the house.

The modest pianist laid out rows of music notebooks, raised and lowered the piano lid, gently blew the keys, and without any apparent purpose he pressed the pedal with his shining shoe, resembling a serviceable locomotive driver at the breakdown of locomotive boilers before the train departed.

The diffident hired pianist spread out a row of sheet music. He gently dusted the piano keys. From time to time and without visible purpose he would depress the pedal, which made him resemble a conscientious locomotive engineer testing his boilers. Reassured that the instrument was in good working order, the hired pianist tucked up the tails of his coat, set himself down on the low stool, flung back his torso, and let his fingers fall on the keys. And he froze, and then a thunderous chord shook the walls.","These sweet fair-haired creatures were in gauze dresses and silver slippers.

Sergei Sergeich Likhutin, second lieutenant in the Gregorian Regiment of His Majesty the King of Siam, went off as though he were going to bed: he was in charge, somewhere out there, of provisions; but going into his room, he sat down to write Nikolai Apollonovich a meek little letter: in the letter he made so bold as to inform Ableukhov that he, Sergei Sergeyevich, second lieutenant in the Gregorian Regiment, most humbly requested the following: while not wishing to meddle for reasons of principle in Nikolai Apollonovich’s relations with his preciously beloved spouse, he none the less urgently requested (the word urgently was thrice underlined) to cease visiting their home for ever, as the nerves of his preciously beloved spouse were upset. As far as his behaviour was concerned, Sergei Sergeyevich resorted to concealment; his behaviour did not change one iota; as before, he left very early in the morning; returned towards midnight; said a ‘fifi’ for propriety’s sake if he saw Baron Ommau-Ommergau, frowned ever so slightly if he saw Lippanchenko, nodded his head in most good-humoured fashion at the words ‘evolution-revolution’, drank a cup of tea and quietly disappeared: he was in charge – somewhere out there – of provisions."

"Розоватое, клочковатое облачко протянулось по Мойке: это было облачко от трубы пробежавшего пароходика; от пароходной кормы холодом проблистала зеленая полоса, ударяясь о берег и отливая янтарным, отдавая – здесь, там – искрою золотой, отдавая – здесь, там – бриллиантом; отлетая от берега, полоса разбивалась о полосу, бьющую ей навстречу, отчего обе полосы начинали блистать роем кольчатых змей. В этот рой въехала лодка; и все змеи разрезались на алмазные струнки; струночки тотчас же путались в серебро чертящую канитель, чтоб потом на поверхности водной качнуться звездами. Но минутное волнение вод успокоилось; воды сгладились, и на них погасли все звезды. Понеслись теперь снова блиставшие водно-зеленые плоскости каменных берегов. Поднимаясь к небу черно-зеленой скульптурой, странно с берега встало зеленое, бело-колонное здание, как живой кусок Ренессанса.","A pinkish, ragged cloud stretched along the Moika: it was a cloud from the chimney of a passing steamboat; a green streak shone with cold from the ship's stern, hitting the shore and casting amber, giving off - here, there - a spark of gold, giving off - here, there - a diamond; flying away from the shore, the strip broke on the strip, hitting it towards it, which is why both strips began to shine like a swarm of ringed snakes. A boat entered this swarm; and all snakes were cut into diamond strings; the strings immediately tangled up in a silver scribbling rigmarole, so that later on the surface of the water they would sway like stars. But the momentary tumult of the waters calmed down; the waters smoothed out, and all the stars went out on them. Now the gleaming water-green planes of the stone shores rushed off again. Rising to the sky as a black-and-green sculpture, a green, white-columned building strangely rose from the shore, like a living piece of the Renaissance.","A pinkish, raggedy little cloud from the stack of a small passing steamboat stretched along the Moika. From the stern ran a gleaming green band, which struck the bank and rippled amber. It surged away from the bank, broke against a band which was racing to meet it, and the bands began gleaming like a swarm of annulated serpents. Into the swarm passed a dinghy. All the serpents were cut up into tiny strands of diamonds. They entwined into silver tinsel, to rock like stars on the watery surface. The agitated waters grew calm, and the stars were all extinguished. From the bank rose a green, white-columned building: a piece of the Renaissance.","A ragged, pink-hued cloud stretched along the Moika: this was a cloud from the funnel of a passing steamer; from the steamer’s prow a strip of green glistened with cold, striking the bank with a flash of amber, reflecting—here and there—a spark of gold, reflecting—here and there—a diamond; as it sprang back from the bank this strip shattered against another strip that came to meet it, making them both glisten in swarms of coiling snakes. The boat sailed into this swarm; and all the snakes were cut into diamond strings; the strings at once wound into one another to make a silver thread, in order then to bobble on the water surface like stars. But the momentary movement of the water settled down; the waters became smooth and the stars upon them ceased to shine. Now just gleaming watery-green surfaces rode between stone banks.

"Варвара Евграфовна нерешительно потянула его за меховой край шинели; он решительно встал; она встала за ним; но еще решительней протянул он ей свои надушенные пальцы, прикоснувшись краем округленных ногтей к ее красной руке. Она не успела что-либо в ту минуту придумать, чтоб его задержать; а уж он в совершенной досаде бежал от нее, запахнувшись надменно и огорченно, и уйдя лицом в меха николаевки. Листья трогались с места медлительно, желтоватыми и сухими кругами окружали полы шинели; но суживались круги, беспокойнее завивались винтами, все живей танцевал золотой, что-то шепчущий винт. Крутень листьев стремительно завивался, переметывался и бежал, не крутясь, как-то вбок, как-то вбок; красный лапчатый лист чуть-чуть тронулся, подлетел и простерся. Как-то матово там протянулась, прямо вставши в стальной горизонт, темноватая сеть из перекрещенных сучьев; в эту сеть он прошел; и когда он прошел в эту сеть, то ворон оголтелая стая вспорхнула и стала кружиться над крышей Петровского домика; темноватая сеть начинала качаться; темноватая сеть начинала гудеть; и слетали какие-то робко-унылые звуки; и сливались все в один звук – в звук органного гласа. А вечерняя атмосфера густела; вновь казалось душе, будто не было настоящего; будто эта вечерняя густота из-за тех вон деревьев трепетно озарится зелено-светлым каскадом; и там, во всем огненном, ярко-красные егеря, протянувши рога, опять мелодически извлекут из зефиров органные волны.","Varvara Evgrafovna hesitantly pulled him by the fur edge of his overcoat; he stood up resolutely; she stood behind him; but even more resolutely he extended his perfumed fingers to her, touching the edge of his rounded nails to her red hand. She did not have time to think of anything at that moment to detain him; and in complete annoyance he fled from her, wrapping himself haughtily and chagrined, and burying his face in the furs of Nikolayevka. The leaves moved slowly, yellowish and dry circles surrounded the skirts of the overcoat; but the circles narrowed, the screws curled more restlessly, the golden screw, whispering something, danced more and more lively. The spin of the leaves rapidly curled, shifted and ran without turning, somehow sideways, somehow sideways; the red palmate leaf moved a little, flew up and stretched out. Somewhat mattly stretched out there, standing straight into the steel horizon, a darkish network of crossed boughs; into this network he passed; and when he passed into this net, a frantic flock of ravens fluttered up and began to circle over the roof of Petrovsky's house; the darkish net began to sway; the darkish network began to buzz; and some kind of timidly dull sounds flew; and all merged into one sound - into the sound of an organ voice. And the evening atmosphere thickened; again it seemed to the soul as if there was no present; as if this evening density, because of those trees over there, will quiveringly light up with a green-light cascade; and there, in everything fiery, the bright red rangers, stretching out their horns, will again melodically extract organ waves from the marshmallows.","He stood up resolutely. He resolutely held out his scented fingers to her. Before she had time to think of something to do, he was already fleeing from her in annoyance, haughtily wrapping himself in the furs of his caped greatcoat. The leaves stirred up from the spot.† They eddied in dry circles about the skirts of the greatcoat. The circles narrowed and curled in ever more restless spirals. The golden spiral whispered something and danced more briskly. A vortex of leaves swirled, wound round and round, and moved off to the side somewhere, off to the side somewhere, without spinning. One red webbed leaf flew up and dipped to the ground. A darkish network of intersecting branches stretched into the steely horizon. He moved into the network, and as he passed, a frenzied flock of crows took wing and began wheeling above the roof of Peter’s small house. And the network began to sway and murmur, and timid and doleful sounds winged down. They merged in an organlike swell. The evening atmosphere thickened. The heart felt as if there were no present, as if out of those very trees the somberness would be illuminated by a quivering bright green light. The bright red huntsmen with horns upraised would elicit melodic organ swells from the zephyrs.","Varvara Evgrafovna pulled hesitantly at the fur trim of his overcoat; he stood up with determination; she stood up after him; but he with even more determination stretched out his scented fingers to her, touching her red hand with the tip of his rounded fingernails. She had no time at that moment to dream up anything to detain him; while he ran away from her in total vexation, wrapped arrogantly and angrily in his Nikolaevan cape, his face immersed in its fur. Leaves began to move sluggishly, encircling the flaps of his coat in dry, yellow rings; but the circles narrowed, began to twist in ever more restless swirls; a golden swirl, whispering something, danced with ever greater vigour. The vortex of leaves twisted swiftly, darted here and there and, no longer swirling, ran off somehow sideways; a ribbed, red leaf moved slightly, flew forwards and lay flat. A dark network of criss-crossed branches stretched out drably, standing straight against the steely horizon; he passed into this network; and when he passed into the network, a ferocious flock of crows shot upwards and started circling above the roof of Peter’s House; the dark network began to rock; the dark network began to hum; and timorously melancholy sounds began to blend together; they merged into a single sound—the sound of an organ voice. The atmosphere of evening thickened; once more the soul sensed that there was no present; that this dense evening atmosphere would be tremulously lit by a bright-green cascade from those distant trees; and there the bright-red huntsmen, fiery-red all over, their horns outstretched, would once again elicit from the zephyrs melodic waves of organ music.","Varvara Yevgrafovna tugged him indecisively by the fur edge of his overcoat; he decisively stood up; she did likewise; but even more decisively did he extend to her his perfumed fingers, touching her red hand with the edge of his rounded fingernails. At that moment she was unable to think of anything that would detain him; and then he fled from her in complete vexation, wrapping himself up haughtily and aggrievedly, and hiding his face in the fur of his Nikolayevka. The leaves moved off sluggishly, surrounding the skirts of the overcoat with dry, yellowish circles; but the circles grew narrower, curling more restlessly in spirals; the golden spiral, whispering something, danced ever more briskly. A vortex of leaves began to swirl impetuously, wound itself round and round and fled, without spinning, somewhere to the side, somewhere to the side; a red palmate leaf barely moved, flew up and spread itself. There, somehow lustrelessly, rising straight up against a steel horizon, was a dark-tinged mesh of criss-crossed branches; into that mesh he walked; and when he walked into that mesh, a frenzied flock of crows flew up and began to circle above the roof of Peter’s little house; the dark-tinged mesh began to sway; the dark-tinged mesh began to drone; and some timidly mournful sounds flew down; and they all fused into one sound – the sound of an organ-like voice. And the evening atmosphere grew thicker; again it seemed to the soul as if there were no present; as if this evening thickness would be lit from behind those trees by a green, luminous cascade; and there, amidst all the fiery light, bright-red huntsmen, stretching forth their horns, would again melodically draw waves of organ music from the zephyrs."

"Мы оставили Софью Петровну Лихутину в затруднительном положении; мы оставили ее на петербургской панели в ту холодную ночь, когда откуда-то издали раздались свистки полицейских, а вокруг побежали какие-то темные очертания. Тогда и она обиженно побежала в обратную сторону; в свою мягкую муфточку обиженно проливала слезы она; с ужасным, ее навек позорящим происшествием не могла она никак примириться. Пусть бы лучше Николай Аполлонович ее иначе обидел, пусть бы лучше ударил ее, пусть бы даже он кинулся через мостик в красном своем домино, – всю бы прочую свою жизнь она его вспоминала бы с жутким трепетом, вспоминала бы до смерти. Софья Петровна Лихутина считала Канавку не каким-нибудь прозаическим местом, где бы можно было себе позволить то, что позволил себе он сейчас; ведь недаром она многократно вздыхала над звуками «Пиковой Дамы»: было что-то сходное с Лизой в этом ее положении (что было сходного, – этого точно она не могла бы сказать); и само собой разумеется, Николая Аполлоновича она мечтала видеть здесь Германом. А Герман?.. Повел себя Герман, как карманный воришка: он, во-первых, со смехотворной трусливостью выставил на нее свою маску из-за дворцового бока; во-вторых, со смехотворной поспешностью помахав перед ней своим домино, растянулся на мостике; и тогда из-под складок атласа прозаически показались панталонные штрипки (эти штрипки-то окончательно вывели ее тогда из себя); в завершение всех безобразий, не свойственных Герману, этот Герман сбежал от какой-то там петербургской полиции; не остался Герман на месте и маски с себя не сорвал, героическим, трагическим жестом; глухим, замирающим голосом не сказал дерзновенно при всех: «Я люблю вас»; и в себя Герман после не выстрелил. Нет, позорное поведение Германа навсегда угасило зарю в ней всех этих трагических дней! Нет, позорное поведение Германа превратило самую мысль о домино в претенциозную арлекинаду; главное самое, ее уронило позорное поведение это; ну, какой же может быть она Лизой, если Германа нет!

Then she, offendedly, ran in the opposite direction; she shed offended tears into her soft muff; she could not reconcile herself to the terrible, forever disgraceful incident. Even if Nikolai Apollonovich had offended her otherwise, if he had better hit her, even if he had rushed across the bridge in his red domino, she would have remembered him for the rest of her life with terrible trepidation, she would have remembered him to death. Sofya Petrovna Likhutina considered Kanavka not some prosaic place where one could afford what he now allowed himself; after all, it was not for nothing that she repeatedly sighed over the sounds of the “Queen of Spades”: there was something similar to Lisa in this position of hers (what was similar, she could not say for sure); and it goes without saying that she dreamed of seeing Nikolai Apollonovich here as Herman. And Herman? .. Herman behaved like a pickpocket: he, firstly, with ridiculous cowardice, put his mask on her from behind the palace side; secondly, waving his dominoes in front of her with ridiculous haste, stretched out on the bridge; and then, from under the folds of the satin, pantalon foot-shoes prosaically appeared (these foot-strings completely pissed her off at that time); to complete all the outrages that are not characteristic of Herman, this Herman escaped from some Petersburg police there; Herman did not stay in place and did not tear off his mask, with a heroic, tragic gesture; in a dull, fading voice he did not boldly say in front of everyone: “I love you”; and Herman did not shoot himself afterwards. No, the shameful behavior of Herman forever extinguished the dawn in her of all these tragic days! No, Herman's disgraceful behavior has turned the very idea of dominoes into a pretentious harlequinade; most importantly, she was dropped by this shameful behavior; Well, what kind of Liza can she be if there is no Herman! So revenge on him, revenge on him!","A MAD DOG YELPED She could not reconcile herself to this incident, which had disgraced her forever.

All the rest of her life she would have remembered him with an awful trembling, she would have remembered until the day she died. Sofia Petrovna Likhutina did not regard the Winter Canal as any prosaic spot where one could permit oneself to do what he had permitted himself.

Crowning all the outrages, all so uncharacteristic of Hermann, was the fact that Hermann had fled from some sort of policemen, and he had not torn the mask from his face in a heroic, tragic gesture. He had not said, in a hollow, sinking voice: “I love you.” And he had not shot himself. No, Hermann’s disgraceful conduct had extinguished the dawn of those days! No, Hermann’s disgraceful conduct had transformed the domino itself into a harlequinade. She had been debased by his disgraceful conduct.

Better if Nikolai Apollonovich had insulted her some other way, if he had struck her, if he had even thrown himself off the bridge in his red domino—then she would have remembered him all the rest of her life with a shudder of horror, remembered him till she died. Sofia Petrovna Lihutina did not regard the Canal as a prosaic place, where you could allow yourself the kind of behaviour he had just allowed himself; it was not for nothing that she had sighed so often at the sounds of The Queen of Spades: there was something similar to Liza in this situation of hers (where the similarity lay she could not have said precisely); and it went without saying that she dreamt of seeing Nikolai Apollonovich here in the role of Hermann. But Hermann? … Hermann had behaved like a pickpocket: in the first place, he had stuck out his mask at her from the side of the palace with laughable cowardice; secondly, after waving his domino in front of her with laughable haste, he had measured his length on the bridge; and then from the folds of his velvet the trouser straps had prosaically appeared (at that moment these straps had finally driven her out of her wits); and to complete the outrages so uncharacteristic of Hermann, this Hermann had run away from a mere Petersburg policeman; he hadn’t stood his ground and torn the mask from his face in a heroic, tragic gesture; he hadn’t said, in a dull, faint voice, in the presence of all, the audacious words: “I love you”; and after that Hermann had not shot himself. No, the shameful behaviour of Hermann had extinguished in her forever the dawning light of all these tragic days! No, the shameful behaviour of Hermann had turned the very thought of the domino into a piece of pretentious buffoonery; and the main thing was that this shameful behaviour had disgraced her; after all, what kind of Liza could she be if there was no Hermann!

"Дни стояли туманные, странные: по России на севере проходил мерзлой поступью ядовитый октябрь; а на юге развесил он гнилые туманы. Ядовитый октябрь обдувал золотой лесной шепот, – и покорно ложился на землю шелестящий осинный багрец, чтобы виться и гнаться у ног прохожего пешехода, и шушукать, сплетая из листьев желто-красные россыпи слов. Та синичья сладкая пискотня, что купается сентябрем в волне лиственной, в волне лиственной не купалась давно: и сама синичка теперь сиротливо скакала в черной сети из сучьев, что как шамканье беззубого старика посылает всю осень свой свист из лесов, голых рощ, палисадников, парков.","The days were foggy, strange: across Russia in the north, poisonous October passed with a frozen tread; and in the south he hung rotten mists. Poisonous October blew a golden forest whisper, and a rustling aspen crimson obediently lay down on the ground to twist and chase at the feet of a passer-by pedestrian, and whisper, weaving yellow-red placers of words from leaves. That blue sweet squeal that bathes in September in a deciduous wave has not bathed in a deciduous wave for a long time: and the titmouse itself now lonely jumped in a black net of boughs, which, like the mumbling of a toothless old man, sends its whistle all autumn from forests, bare groves, front gardens, parks .","Those were foggy days, strange days. Noxious October marched on with frozen gait. It hung out dank mists in the south. October blew off the golden woodland whisper, and that whisper fell to earth, and there fell the rustling aspen crimson, to wind and chase at the feet, and whish, plaiting yellow-red scatterings of leaves. And that sweet chirruping, which in September swims in a leafy wave, had not swum for a long time. And now the tomtit hopped forlorn in branches black, which all autumn long send forth their whistling from woods, gardens, and parks.","Those were strange, misty days: across the north of Russia venomous October was passing with its freezing tread; and across the south it draped dank mists. Venomous October fanned the forest’s golden whisper, and the forest’s golden whisper submissively lay down upon the ground—and the rustling purple of the aspens submissively lay down upon the ground, to wind and chase at the feet of a passing pedestrian, and to murmur as it wove from leaves a red-and-yellow web of words. That sweet chirruping of blue tits that in September bathes in waves of foliage had long since ceased to bathe in foliage: and the blue tit herself was now hopping forlornly in the black network of boughs, which all autumn long, like the mumble of a toothless dotard, sends its whistle from the forests, leafless groves, the gardens and the parks.","The days were foggy, strange: over the north of Russia poisonous October walked with frozen tread; and in the south he spread muggy mists.

That sweet peeping of the blue tit, which in September bathes in a leafy wave, had not bathed in a leafy wave for a long time: and the blue tit itself now hopped lonely in a black mesh of branches, which like the mumbling of a toothless old man all autumn sends its whistle out of woodlands, leafless groves, front gardens and parks."

Почему-то отметился вдруг один искристый рой, из центра которого раздавался неугомонный, но сдержанный говор; забасил оттуда, из центра, будто бархатный, огромных размеров шмель; он был ниже всех ростом, и когда обстали его златогрудые старички, то его и вовсе не было видно. А когда богатырского роста граф Дубльве с синей лентой через плечо, проводя рукою по сединам, с мягкой какой-то развязностью, подошел к старческой кучечке и прищурил глаза, он увидел, что этим гудящим центром оказался Аполлон Аполлонович. Тотчас же Аполлон Аполлонович оборвал свою речь, и с не слишком яркой сердечностью, но с сердечностью все же, протянул свою руку к той роковой руке, которая подписала только что условия одного чрезвычайного договора: договор же был подписан в… Америке. Граф Дубльве как-то мягко нагнулся к бывшему ему по плечо голому черепу, и шипящая острота поползла проворно в ухо бледно-зеленых отливов; острота эта, впрочем, улыбки не вызвала; не улыбались на шутку и златогрудые, обставшие старички; и сама собою растаяла кучечка. С богатырского вида сановником Аполлон Аполлонович и спускался по лестнице; пред Аполлоном Аполлоновичем граф Дубльве шел в изогнутом положении; выше их опускались искрометные старички, ниже их – горбоносый посол одного далекого государства, старичок красногубый, восточный; между ними – маленький, бело-золотой и, как палка, прямой опускался Аполлон Аполлонович на огненном фоне сукна, покрывавшего лестницу.","Immediately after the extraordinary passage, detour and graciously uttered words, the old men gathered again - in the hall, in the vestibule, at the columns of the balustrade. For some reason, one sparkling swarm suddenly appeared, from the center of which a restless but restrained voice was heard; boomed from there, from the center, like a velvet, huge bumblebee; he was shorter than everyone else, and when his golden-breasted old men surrounded him, he was not at all visible. And when Count Dublve, of heroic stature, with a blue ribbon over his shoulder, running his hand through his gray hair, with some kind of soft swagger, approached the old pile and screwed up his eyes, he saw that Apollon Apollonovich turned out to be this buzzing center. Immediately, Apollon Apollonovich broke off his speech, and with not too bright cordiality, but with cordiality nevertheless, extended his hand to that fatal hand that had just signed the terms of one emergency treaty: the treaty was signed in ... America. Count Dublve somehow gently bent down to the bare skull that was up to his shoulder, and a hissing wit crept deftly into the ear of the pale green tides; this witticism, however, did not cause a smile; the golden-breasted old men who surrounded themselves did not smile in jest; and the pile melted by itself. With a heroic appearance, the dignitary Apollon Apollonovich descended the stairs; in front of Apollon Apollonovich, Count Dublve walked in a bent position; Above them, sparkling old men descended, below them - a hook-nosed ambassador of a distant state, an old man with red lips, oriental; between them - a small, white-gold and, like a stick, Apollon Apollonovich descended straight against the fiery background of the cloth that covered the stairs.","Immediately after the levee, the little old men once more swarmed together by the columns of the balustrade. One sparkling swarm suddenly took form, and from it came a velvety beelike droning. Someone shorter than the rest was standing there. He was surrounded by little old men; he could not be seen. When Count Witte,† heroically proportioned, a shining blue ribbon across his chest, his hand passing through his gray hair, came up with studied casualness and squinted, he saw that it was Apollon Apollonovich who was droning on. Apollon Apollonovich interrupted his speech and with vague cordiality, but with cordiality all the same, extended his hand to the hand which had just signed the terms of a certain treaty.† Count Witte bent over toward the head which came up to his shoulder, and cracked a joke. But his joke evoked no smile. The little old men did not smile at the joke either. And the small cluster melted away. Apollon Apollonovich descended the staircase with Witte. Above them descended the little old men; below them, a hook-nosed ambassador, a red-lipped little old man, oriental; amidst them, all gold, ramrod straight, descended the senator against the fiery background of the carpet that covered the staircase.","As soon as the extraordinary inspection and graciously uttered words were done, the little old men once again swarmed together—in the great hall, in the anteroom, by the columns of the balustrade. For some reason one sparkling swarm stood out, from the centre of which was heard the sound of tireless, but restrained voices; a deep bass emerged from the centre of the group, like a velvet bumblebee of immense dimensions; he was shorter than all the others, and when he was surrounded by golden-breasted old men, he could not be seen at all. And when Count W, the size of a folklore bogatyr, with a blue ribbon across his shoulder, passing his hand across his grey locks, went up to the cluster of old men with a certain nonchalance and screwed his eyes up, he saw that this humming centre was Apollon Apollonovich. At once Apollon Apollonovich broke off his speech, and without marked cordiality, but with cordiality all the same, extended his hand to that fateful hand that had just signed the terms of a most important treaty: the treaty had been signed—in America. Count W bent down gently to the bare skull that came up only to his shoulders, and a hissing witticism slipped nimbly into the ear of pale-green tints; the witticism, however, evoked no smile: nor did the golden-breasted little old men around them smile; and the cluster dissolved of its own accord. Apollon Apollonovich went down the stairs in the company of this dignitary of folkloric appearance; in front of Apollon Apollonovich Count W walked bent double; above them descended sparkling old men, below them—the hook-nosed ambassador of a distant country, a little red-lipped old man, oriental; between them Apollon Apollonovich—small, gold and white, erect as a pole—descended on the fiery background of the carpet that covered the staircase.","But immediately after the extraordinary levee, circumambulation and graciously uttered words, the little old men once again swarmed together – in the hall, in the vestibule, by the columns of the balustrade. For some reason one sparkling swarm suddenly marked itself out, and from its centre came a restless but restrained sound of talking; from there, from the centre, it was as if a velvet bumble-bee of enormous dimensions had begun to drone; he was shorter than all the others in stature, and when the gold-chested little old men surrounded him he could not be seen at all. And when Count Doublevé, of bogatyr-like8 stature, with a blue sash over his shoulder, passing a hand through his grey hair, approached the group of little old men with a kind of easy familiarity and screwed up his eyes, he saw that this droning centre was Apollon Apollonovich. At once Apollon Apollonovich broke off his discourse, and with a cordiality that was not excessively lively, but was cordiality none the less, extended his hand to that fateful hand which had just signed the terms of a certain extraordinary treaty; the treaty had however been signed in … America. Count Doublevé somehow managed to stoop gently down to the bare cranium that came up to his shoulder, and a hissed witticism crept adroitly into an ear of pale green tints; this witticism did not, as a matter of fact, call forth a smile; the surrounding gold-chested little old men did not smile at the joke either; and the group melted away of its own accord. Together with the dignitary of bogatyr-like appearance, Apollon Apollonovich, too, descended the staircase; before Apollon Apollonovich Count Doublevé walked in a bent position; above them descended the sparkling little old men, below them the hook-nosed ambassador of a distant state, a little old man with red lips, Oriental; between them – small, white and gold and straight as a rod – Apollon Apollonovich descended against a fiery background of the cloth that covered the staircase."

"Тут откуда-то сбоку стремительно распахнулась низкая дверь и осталась открытой; повалил белый пар, раздалась руготня, дребезжание жалкое балалайки и голос.

"Николай Аполлонович весь откинулся; ужасом на нее уставился его взор; но ее он не видел: его губы шептали, должно быть, какие-то вовсе невнятные вещи, – и Софья Петровна хотела уж броситься к нему из угла, потому что она не могла далее выносить этих расширенных, на нее устремленных взоров.

Then people came into the room; the red domino nervously concealed the note in his fingers as they slipped into the folds of the cape; but the red domino forgot to lower the mask.

"И поздненько же ангел Пери сегодня изволил открыть из подушек свои невинные глазки; но глазки слипались; а в головке явственно развивалась глухо-тупая боль; ангел Пери изволил долго еще пребывать в дремоте; под кудрями роились все какие-то невнятности, беспокойства, полунамеки: первой полною мыслью была мысль о вечере: что-то будет! Но когда она пыталась развить эту мысль, ее глазки окончательно слиплись и опять пошли в какие-то невнятности, беспокойства, полунамеки; и из этих неясностей вновь восстало единственно: Помпадур, Помпадур, Помпадур, – а что Помпадур? Но душа ей светло осветила то слово: костюм в духе мадам Помпадур – лазурный, цветочками, кружева валансьен, серебристые туфли, помпоны! О костюме в стиле мадам Помпадур на днях она долго так спорила со своею портнихой; мадам Фарнуа все никак не хотела ей уступить относительно блондов; говорила: «И зачем это блонды?» Но как же без блондов? По мнению мадам Фарнуа, блонды должны выглядеть так-то, быть тогда-то; и совсем не так должны были выглядеть блонды, по мнению Софьи Петровны. Мадам Фарнуа ей сначала сказала: «Моего вкуса, вашего вкуса, – ну, как же не быть стилю мадам Помпадур!» Но Софья Петровна уступить не хотела; и мадам Фарнуа обиженно предложила обратно ей взять материал. Отнесите в Maison Tricotons: «Там, мадам, вам не станут перечить…» Но отдать в Maison Tricotons: – фи, фи, фи! И блонды оставили, как оставили и иные спорные пункты относительно стиля мадам Помпадур: например, для рук легкая chapeau Bergére, но без юбки-панье нельзя было никак обойтись.","And late today, the angel Peri deigned to open his innocent eyes from the pillows; but the eyes stuck together; and in the head a deaf-dull pain clearly developed; the angel Peri deigned to remain in slumber for a long time; under the curls swarm all sorts of indistinctness, anxiety, half hints: the first full thought was the thought of the evening: something will happen! But when she tried to develop this thought, her eyes closed completely and again went into some kind of indistinctness, anxiety, half hints; and out of these obscurities, only one arose again: Pompadour, Pompadour, Pompadour—and what is Pompadour? But her soul brightly illuminated that word: a costume in the spirit of Madame Pompadour - azure, with flowers, Valenciennes lace, silvery shoes, pompons! About a costume in the style of Madame Pompadour the other day she had been arguing for a long time with her dressmaker; Madame Farnoy still did not want to give in to her regarding blonds; said: “And why are these blondes?” But what about blondes? According to Madame Farnoy, blondes should look like this, be then; and blondes were not supposed to look like this at all, according to Sofya Petrovna. Madame Farnoy at first told her: “My taste, your taste, well, how could Madame Pompadour’s style not be!” But Sofya Petrovna did not want to yield; and Madame Farnoy resentfully offered to take the material back to her. Take it to Maison Tricotons: “There, madam, they won’t argue with you ...” But give it to Maison Tricotons: - fi, fi, fi! And the blondes left, as they left other controversial points regarding the style of Madame Pompadour: for example, a light chapeau Bergére for the hands, but it was impossible to do without a pannier skirt.","And my, was it ever late when Angel Peri deigned to open her innocent little eyes from the depths of the pillows! But the little eyes kept closing. She deigned to remain in a state of drowsiness for quite a while longer. Beneath her curls swarmed things inapprehensible and restless, half-hints. And her first thought was the thought of the soirée that evening: what ever is going to happen there! But when she tried to develop this thought, her little eyes shut; the restless feelings, the half-hints started up again. One thing alone emerged: Pompadour, Pompadour, Pompadour! And why Pompadour?† But her soul illumined the word: the Pompadour costume—Valenciennes lace, silvery slippers, pompons! In the last few days she had been having long arguments with her dressmaker. Madame Farnois had not wanted to yield on the matter of blonde lace: “Why do you want blonde lace?” But how could she do without blonde lace? Madame Farnois at first had said: “With your taste and mine, how can it not be in the style of Madame Pompadour!” But Sofia Petrovna had not wanted to yield, and Madame Farnois proposed that she take the fabric back. “Take it to Maison Tricotons. There, Madame, they wouldn’t think of contradicting you.” But to give it to Tricotons—fie, fie, fie! And the blonde lace was abandoned, as was the chapeau Bergère. But without a pannier for the long skirt—impossible.","It was pretty late today when the Angel Peri deigned to open her innocent eyes from her pillows; but her eyelids were too heavy; and in her little head a dull, vague pain was definitely developing: the Angel Peri deigned to remain a long time in a state of drowsiness; beneath her curls all manner of incoherence, anxiety and half-grasped intimations swarmed around: her first complete thought was a thought about the evening: what was going to happen! But when she attempted to develop this thought the weight of her eyelids completely overcame her, and the incoherence, anxiety and half-grasped intimations returned; and out of this confusion there rose again exclusively: Pompadour, Pompadour, Pompadour—what was this Pompadour? But brightly that word was lit up in her soul: a costume in the style of Madame Pompadour—light blue, with flowers, Valenciennes lace, silver slippers, pompons! She had had such a long argument with her dressmaker the other day about a costume in the style of Madame Pompadour; Madame Farnois simply would not give way to her on the matter of blonde lace; she kept saying: “What do you want the blonde lace for?” But how could you manage without blonde lace? In Madame Farnois’s opinion blonde lace had to look like this and be used on such-and-such occasions; and in Sofia Petrovna’s opinion blonde lace didn’t have to look like that at all. At first Madame Farnois had said to her, “My taste, your taste—that’s not how we get the Pompadour style!” But Sofia Petrovna was not willing to give way, and Madame Farnois was so offended that she suggested she should take the material back. Take it to Maison Tricotons: “They won’t start contradicting you there, Madame …” But take it to Maison Tricotons:—what an idea! And they dropped the blonde lace, just as they dropped various other contentious issues as regards the style of Madame Pompadour: for example, a light chapeau Bergère for her hands, but there was no way she could do without a pannier skirt.","And indeed, it was somewhat late when Angel Peri deigned to open her innocent little eyes from the pillows that day; but the eyes had stuck together; and the little head was quite manifestly developing a dull and hollow ache ; Angel Peri managed to remain in a state of somnolence for a long time yet; beneath her curls some kind of inarticulacies, anxieties, half-hints kept swarming: her first complete thought was a thought about the soirée: something was going to happen! But when she tried to develop this thought, her little eyes stuck together properly and again moved off into some kind of inarticulacies, anxieties, half-hints; and from these indistinct phenomena there again rose only: Pompadour, Pompadour, Pompadour – and why Pompadour? But her soul radiantly illumined that word: the costume in the spirit of Madame Pompadour – azure, with flowerlets, Valenciennes lace, silvery slippers, pompons! She had had such a long argument with her dressmaker the other day about the costume in the style of Madame Pompadour; Madame Farnois had on no account been willing to cede to her on the matter of blonde lace; had kept saying: ‘ And why do you want blonde lace?’ But how could she do without blonde lace? In the opinion of Madame Farnois, blonde lace must look so, be included on such-and-such occasions; and in Sofya Petrovna’s opinion, blonde lace must not look like that at all. At first Madame Farnois said to her: ‘With my taste, and your taste – how can it fail to be in the style of Madame Pompadour?’ But Sofya Petrovna had been unwilling to cede, and Madame Farnois offendedly proposed to take the material back from her. ‘ Take it to Maison Tricotons:3 There , madame, they won’t contradict you …’ But to give it to Maison Tricotons: fi, fi, fi! And the blonde lace was abandoned, as were the other controversial points of the Madame Pompadour style: the light chapeau Bergère for the hands, for example, though a panniered skirt could on no account be dispensed with."

"Аполлон Аполлонович мимоходом взглянул на помпейские фрески и вспомнил, чья заботливая рука поразвесила их по стенам; заботливая рука принадлежала Анне Петровне: Аполлон Аполлонович брезгливо поджал свои губы и прошел к себе в кабинет; у себя в кабинете Аполлон Аполлонович имел обычай запираться на ключ; безотчетную грусть вызывали пространства комнатной анфилады; все оттуда, казалось, на него побежит кто-то вечно знакомый и странный; Аполлон Аполлонович с большой охотой перебрался бы из своего огромного помещения в помещение более скромное; ведь живали же его подчиненные в более скромных квартирочках; а вот он, Аполлон Аполлонович Аблеухов, должен был отказаться навек от пленительной тесноты: высота поста его к тому вынуждала; так был вынужден Аполлон Аполлонович праздно томиться в холодной квартире на набережной; вспоминал он частенько и былую обитательницу этих блещущих комнат: Анну Петровну. Два уже года, как Анна Петровна уехала от него с итальянским артистом.","Apollo Apollonovich glanced casually at the Pompeian frescoes and remembered whose caring hand hung them on the walls; the caring hand belonged to Anna Petrovna: Apollon Apollonovich pursed his lips in disgust and went into his study; in his office, Apollon Apollonovich used to lock himself with a key; an unaccountable melancholy was evoked by the spaces of the enfilade; everything from there, it seemed, someone eternally familiar and strange would run at him; Apollon Apollonovich would have moved with great pleasure from his huge premises to a more modest one; after all, his subordinates lived in more modest apartments; and here he is, Apollon Apollonovich Ableukhov, had to give up forever from the captivating tightness: the height of the post forced him to do so; so Apollon Apollonovich was forced to languish idly in a cold apartment on the embankment; He often recalled the former inhabitant of these glittering rooms: Anna Petrovna.

"Помнится, в тот период пришлось ему развивать парадоксальнейшую теорию о необходимости разрушить культуру, потому что период историей изжитого гуманизма закончен и культурная история теперь стоит перед нами, как выветренный трухляк: наступает период здорового зверства, пробивающийся из темного народного низа (хулиганство, буйство апашей), из аристократических верхов (бунт искусств против установленных форм, любовь к примитивной культуре, экзотика) и из самой буржуазии (восточные дамские моды, кэк-уок – негрский танец; и – далее); Александр Иванович в эту пору проповедовал сожжение библиотек, университетов, музеев; проповедовал он и призванье монголов (впоследствии он испугался монголов). Все явления современности разделялись им на две категории: на признаки уже изжитой культуры и на здоровое варварство, принужденное пока таиться под маскою утонченности (явление Ницше и Ибсена) и под этою маскою заражать сердца хаосом, уже тайно взывающим в душах.","I remember that at that time he had to develop the most paradoxical theory about the need to destroy culture, because the period of obsolete humanism in history is over and cultural history now stands before us like weathered rotten wood: a period of healthy atrocity is coming, making its way from the dark folk bottom (hooliganism, rampage of the Apaches) , from the aristocratic elite (revolt of the arts against established forms, love for primitive culture, exoticism) and from the bourgeoisie itself (oriental ladies' fashions, cake walk - Negro dance; and - further); Alexander Ivanovich at that time preached the burning of libraries, universities, museums; he also preached the calling of the Mongols (later he was frightened of the Mongols). All the phenomena of modernity were divided by him into two categories: into signs of an already obsolete culture and into healthy barbarism, forced for the time being to lurk under the guise of refinement (the phenomenon of Nietzsche and Ibsen) and under this mask to infect hearts with chaos, already secretly crying out in souls.","At that time he had had occasion to develop his highly paradoxical theory about the necessity of destroying culture.† The period of humanism had outlived its time and was over.

Oh, yes, yes: Alexander Ivanovich had preached burning the libraries, universities, museums, and summoning the Mongols. (Later on he took fright.) He had preached all that in a Helsingfors coffeehouse at one time.","He recalled that at that time he had had occasion to develop the most paradoxical theory about the necessity of destroying culture, because the era of historically outlived humanism was at an end, and all cultural history stood before us now like an eroded ruin: a period of healthy bestialism was beginning, emerging from the depths of the ordinary people (hooliganism, the riotous behaviour of the apaches), from aristocratic high society (the uprising of the arts against established forms, love of primitive culture, the exotic), and from the bourgeoisie itself (oriental ladies’ fashions, the cakewalk—a negro dance; and—so on); at that time Alexandr Ivanovich advocated the burning of libraries, universities, and museums; he advocated the summoning of the Mongols (later he became afraid of the Mongols).

Inside the entrance she very distinctly saw a black spot, like a mask, staring at her. There was something red beneath the mask, and Sofia Petrovna tugged at the bell. And when the door flew open and a stream of light fell on the stairs, Mavrushka let out a shriek and flung up her hands. Sofia Petrovna flew headlong into the apartment. Mavrushka saw: behind her mistress was a red domino extending a black mask with a fan of lace, which was, it goes without saying, black too. Luckily she did not turn her head. The red domino extended toward Mavrushka a bloody sleeve, from which a calling card protruded. Sofia Petrovna scrutinized the calling card on which was engraved a skull and crossbones, not a nobleman’s coronet. And on it was written: “I await you at the masquerade ball on such-and-such a date.”","Here’s what it’s all about: a few days earlier Sofia Petrovna Likhutina was on her way home from Baroness R R’s. At the Baroness’ that evening there had been knockings; lustreless sparks had travelled across the walls; and once the table had even jumped: nothing more; but Sofia Petrovna’s nerves were strained to breaking point (she wandered round the streets after the séance), and the entrance to her flat was not lit (in cheap flats they don’t light the entrances): and inside the black doorway Sofia Petrovna saw with such clarity, blacker than the darkness, a shape like a black mask staring at her; something gleamed a dull red under the mask, and Sofia Petrovna tugged with all her might at the bell. And when the door was thrown open and a beam of bright light from the hall fell on to the staircase, Mavrushka screamed and threw up her hands: Sofia Petrovna did not see anything, because she flew full tilt through into the apartment. Mavrushka did see: behind the mistress’ back a red velvet domino stretched forward its black mask, surrounded from below by a dense fan of lace, black too, of course, so that this black lace fell on to Sofia Petrovna’s shoulders (a good thing she didn’t turn her head); the red domino stretched out to Mavrushka its blood-red sleeve, from which a visiting card protruded; and when the door slammed shut in front of the hand, then Sofia Petrovna too saw by the door a visiting card (it must have slipped through the aperture); and what was inscribed on that visiting card? A skull and crossbones in place of a crown of the nobility and in a fashionable typeface the words: ‘I shall expect you at the masquerade—such-and-such a place, such-and-such a date’; and then the signature: ‘The Red Clown’.","The fact of the matter was this: several days ago Sofya Petrovna Likhutina had returned home from Baroness R.R. At Baroness R.R.’s that evening there had been table-tapping; whitish sparks had run across the wall; and on one occasion the table had even jumped: no more; but Sofya Petrovna’s nerves were stretched to the limit (after a seance she wandered about the streets), and the entrance porch to her house was not lit (the entrance porches to blocks of cheap flats are not lit): and inside the black entrance Sofya Petrovna very distinctly saw a spot even blacker than the darkness staring at her – it looked like a black mask; something showed dimly red beneath the mask, and with all her strength Sofya Petrovna tugged at the bell. And when the door flew open and a stream of bright light from the hallway fell on the staircase, Mavrushka uttered a scream and threw up her hands: Sofya Petrovna saw nothing, because she impetuously flew past into the flat. Mavrushka saw: behind the barynya’s back a red, satin domino stretched forward its black mask, surrounded from below by a thick lace fan that was of course black, so that this black lace fell towards Sofya Petrovna’s shoulder (it was a good thing that she did not turn her little head); the red domino stretched out to Mavrushka its bloody sleeve, from which a visiting card protruded; and when the door slammed in front of the hand, Sofya Petrovna, too, saw the visiting card by the door (it had doubtless flown through the crack in the doorway); but what was drawn on that visiting card? A skull and crossbones instead of a nobleman’s coronet and also the words, set in fashionable script: ‘ I await you at the masked ball – at such-and-such a place, on such-and-such a date’; and then the signature: ‘The Red Buffoon’."

"Еще в первый день своего, так сказать, «дамства», при совершении таинства бракосочетания, когда Николай Аполлонович держал над мужем ее, Сергеем Сергеевичем, высокоторжественный венец, Софью Петровну Лихутину мучительно поразил стройный шафер, красавец, цвет его неземных, темно-синих, огромных глаз, белость мраморного лица и божественность волос белольняных: те глаза ведь не глядели, как часто впоследствии, из-за тусклых стекол пенсне, а лицо подпирал золотой воротник новенького мундирчика (не у всякого же студента есть такой воротник). Ну, и… Николай Аполлонович зачастил к Лихутиным сперва раз в две недели; далее – раз в неделю; два, три, четыре раза в неделю; наконец, зачастил ежедневно. Скоро Софья Петровна заметила под маскою ежедневных заходов, что лицо Николая Аполлоновича, богоподобное, строгое, превратилось в маску: ужимочки, бесцельные потирания иногда потных рук, наконец, неприятное лягушечье выраженье улыбки, проистекавшее от несходившей с лица игры всевозможнейших типов, заслонили навек то лицо от нее. И как только это заметила Софья Петровна, она к ужасу своему поняла, что была в то лицо влюблена, в то, а не это. Ангел Пери хотела быть примерной женой: а ужасная мысль, что, будучи верной, она уже увлеклась не мужем, – эта мысль совершенно разбила ее. Но далее, далее: из-под маски, ужимок, лягушечьих уст она бессознательно вызывала безвозвратно потерянную влюбленность: она мучила Аблеухова, осыпала его оскорбленьями; но, таясь от себя, рыскала по его следам, узнавала его стремленья и вкусы, бессознательно им следовала, все надеясь обресть в них подлинный, богоподобный лик; так она заломалась: появилась на сцену сперва мелопластика, потом кирасир барон Оммау-Оммергау, наконец, появилась Варвара Евграфовна с жестяною кружкою для собирания фифок.","Even on the first day of his, so to speak, “ladydom”, during the sacrament of marriage, when Nikolai Apollonovich held a highly solemn crown over her husband, Sergei Sergeyevich, Sofya Petrovna Likhutina was painfully struck by a slender best man, a handsome man, the color of his unearthly, dark blue, huge eyes, the whiteness of a marble face and the divinity of white-linen hair: after all, those eyes did not look, as often later, because of the dull glasses of pince-nez, and the face was propped up by the golden collar of a brand new uniform (not every student has such a collar). Well, and ... Nikolai Apollonovich often visited the Likhutins at first once every two weeks; further - once a week; two, three, four times a week; finally, frequented daily. Soon Sofya Petrovna noticed, under the mask of daily visits, that the face of Nikolai Apollonovich, god-like, stern, turned into a mask: grimaces, aimless rubbing of sometimes sweaty hands, finally, an unpleasant frog-like expression of a smile, resulting from the game of all possible types that never left his face, obscured that face forever from her. And as soon as Sofya Petrovna noticed this, she realized to her horror that she was in love with that person, with that, and not that. Angel Peri wanted to be an exemplary wife: and the terrible thought that, being faithful, she was already carried away by a husband, this thought completely broke her. But further, further: from under the mask, grimaces, frog lips, she unconsciously evoked irretrievably lost love: she tormented Ableukhov, showered him with insults; but, hiding from herself, she prowled in his footsteps, recognized his aspirations and tastes, unconsciously followed them, all hoping to find in them a genuine, god-like face; so she broke down: first the meloplasty appeared on the stage, then the cuirassier Baron Ommau-Ommergau, and finally Varvara Evgrafovna appeared with a tin mug for collecting fifoks.","Even on the first day of “marital bliss,” when Nikolai Apollonovich held the solemn nuptial crown over Sergei Sergeyevich’s head, Sofia Petrovna Likhutina had been struck by the trim, handsome best man, by the color of his eyes, the pallor of his face and the fairness of his hair. His eyes did not peer, as they often did later, from behind the lenses of a pince-nez, and the face was propped up by a gold collar (the likes of which not everybody has). And . . . Nikolai Apollonovich became a regular visitor: at first once every two weeks; then, once a week; and, finally, he began to visit daily. Soon Sofia Petrovna noticed that Nikolai Apollonovich’s face had turned into a mask. The aimless rubbing of his sweaty hands and the froglike look of his smile, alas, screened the face from her. And as soon as Sofia Petrovna noticed that, she understood she had been in love with that face, that other one, not this one. From behind the froglike lips she unconsciously tried to summon up her lost infatuation, and she tormented Ableukhov. But hiding what she was doing from herself, she began dogging his steps, she tried to ascertain his tastes and inclinations, she followed them herself, hoping in them to recover her loss. She started putting on airs: first meloplastics appeared on the scene, and then the cuirassier. Varvara Evgrafovna appeared with the tin box for the collection of “phoophoos.”","On the very first day of her ‘lady-hood’, as it were, during the performance of the sacrament of marriage, when Nikolai Apollonovich held the ceremonial crown over her husband, Sergei Sergeevich, Sofia Petrovna had been painfully struck by the handsome, elegant best man, the colour of his huge, unearthly, dark-blue eyes, the whiteness of his marble face and the godlike quality of his flaxen hair: those eyes were not gazing then, as they often did later, from behind the dull lenses of a pince-nez, and his face was cradled by the gold collar of a smart new uniform (not every student has a collar like that). Well, and … Nikolai Apollonovich became a regular visitor at the Likhutins’ at first once every two weeks; then—once a week; two, three, four times a week; and in the end, every day. Soon Sofia Petrovna noticed beneath the mask of those everyday visits that Nikolai Apollonovich’s face, godlike, severe, had turned into a mask: grimaces, an aimless rubbing of his sometimes sweaty hands, finally the unpleasant frog-like expression of his smile, arising from the way the most diverse mannerisms played across his face, obscured that face from her forever. And as soon as Sofia Petrovna noticed that, she realised to her horror that she had been in love with that face, that one, but not this. The Angel Peri wished to be an exemplary wife: and the terrible thought that, while faithful, she had already become infatuated with someone other than her husband— this thought completely shattered her. But things went further: from beneath the mask, the grimaces, the frog-like lips, she tried unconsciously to summon back her irretrievably lost infatuation: she tormented Ableukhov, showered him with insults; but, in secret from herself, she dogged his tracks, discovered his tastes and strivings, unconsciously followed them, trying all the while to recapture in them the genuine, godlike countenance; and so she began to act a part: first meloplastics appeared on the scene, then the cuirassier Baron Ommau-Ommergau, and finally Varvara Evgrafovna appeared with the tin tankard for collecting whiffies.","Even on the first day of her, so to speak, ‘ladyhood’ during the accomplishment of the ritual of marriage, when Nikolai Apollonovich held above her husband, Sergei Sergeyevich, the most solemn crown, Sofya Petrovna Likhutina had been tormentingly struck by the slim and handsome best man, by the colour of his unearthly, dark blue, enormous eyes, the whiteness of his marble face and the godlike quality of his blond flaxen hair: for those eyes did not look, as they often did later, from behind the dim lenses of a pince-nez, and his face was supported by the gold collar of a brand new uniform jacket (not every student has such a collar). Well, and … Nikolai Apollonovich started visiting the Likhutins at first once every two weeks; later it became once a week; two, three, four times a week; in the end he came daily. Soon Sofya Petrovna noticed under the mask of these daily visits that Nikolai Apollonovich’s face, godlike, stern, had turned into a mask: the little grimaces, the aimless rubbing of his sometimes sweaty hands, and ultimately the unpleasant froglike expression of his smile, which proceeded from the play of every conceivable type that never left his face, obscured that face from her for ever. And as soon as Sofya Petrovna noticed this, to her horror she realized that she was in love with that face, that one, and not this. Angel Peri wanted to be a model wife: and the dreadful thought that, while yet faithful, she had already fallen for someone who was not her husband – this thought completely shattered her. But more, more: from behind the mask, the grimaces, the froglike lips, she unconsciously tried to call forth her irrevocably lost being-in-love: she tormented Ableukhov, showered him with insults; but, concealing it from herself, dogged his footsteps, tried to find out what were his aspirations and tastes, unconsciously followed them in the constant hope of finding in them the authentic, godlike countenance; so she started to put on airs: first meloplastics appeared on the scene, then the cuirassier, Baron Ommau-Ommergau, and finally Varvara Yevgrafovna with the tin box for the collection of ‘fifis’."

Под влиянием светлой особы ангел Пери поставил на стол и самую свою медную кружку с туманною надписью: «Благотворительный сбор». Разумеется, эта кружка была предназначена для гостей; все же личности, относящиеся к гостям так сказать, раз навсегда Софьей Петровной Лихутиной от поборов освобождались; но поборами были обложены и граф Авен, и барон Оммау-Оммергау, и Шпорышев, и Вергефден. Под влиянием той же светлой особы ангел Пери стал захаживать по утрам в городскую школу О. О. и долбил без всякого толку «Манифест» Карла Маркса. Дело в том, что в ту пору у нее ежедневно бывал студент, Николенька Аблеухов, которого можно было без риску ей познакомить как с Варварой Евграфовной (влюбленной в Николеньку), так и с желтым Ее Величества кирасиром. Аблеухов, как сын Аблеухова, всюду, конечно, был принят.","Under the influence of a bright person, the angel Peri once illuminated with his presence - well, imagine: a rally!

The fact is that at that time she had a student every day, Nikolenka Ableukhov, whom she could safely introduce both to Varvara Evgrafovna (in love with Nikolenka) and to Her Majesty's yellow cuirassier.

At the fateful moment when according to his calculations the Mongol (imprinted on his consciousness but no longer visible) was stealing toward him, something, with a roar like the wind in a chimney, began rapidly pulling his consciousness out through the blue sincipital breach: into that which lies beyond.","And Apollon Apollonovich, lost without trace, robbed of sensation, suddenly bereft of the very awareness of his body, transformed into nothing but vision and hearing, imagined that he had raised up the space of his pupils (with the sense of touch he could not say for certain that his eyes were raised up, for the awareness of his body had been discarded)—and, raising up his eyes in the direction of where the crown of his head should be, he saw that there was no crown of his head, since at the point where the brain is compressed by strong, heavy bones, where there is neither gaze nor vision—at that point Apollon Apollonovich inside Apollon Apollonovich caught sight of a round aperture pierced through into the dark-azure distance (in the place of the crown); this aperture—a blue circle—was surrounded by a wheel of flying sparks, glints, gleams; at the fatal moment when by Apollon Apollonovich’s calculations the Mongol (merely impressed on the consciousness, but no longer visible) was already stealing up to his powerless body (the blue circle in that body was the exit from the body)—at that same time something began, with a roar and a whistle, like the sound of the wind in the chimney, to drag Apollon Apollonovich’s consciousness out of the glittering vortex (through the blue aperture in his crown) into the starry realm beyond. Thereupon an outrage occurred (at that moment Apollon Apollonovich’s consciousness noted that such an event had happened before: where and when—he could not remember)—thereupon an outrage occurred: the wind whistled Apollon Apollonovich’s consciousness out of Apollon Appollonovich.","And unknowing, unfeeling, suddenly bereft of ponderability, suddenly bereft of the very sensation of his body, turned merely into vision and hearing, Apollon Apollonovich imagined that he had lifted up the space of his eyes (he could not say positively by touch that his eyes were lifted up, for he had thrown off the sense of corporeality), and, having lifted up his eyes in the direction of the site of the crown of his head, he saw that there was no crown, for in the place where the brain is compressed by strong, heavy bones, where there is no sight, no vision – Apollon Apollonovich saw inside Apollon Apollonovich a round, gaping breach into a dark blue distance (in place of the crown); the gaping breach – a dark blue circle – was surrounded by a wheel of flying sparks, highlights, gleams; at that fateful moment when according to his calculations the Mongol (only imprinted on his consciousness, but no longer visible) was creeping up on his helpless body (in that body the dark blue circle was a way out of the body) – at that very moment, with a roaring and a whistling like the sound of the wind in a chimney, something began to suck Apollon Apollonovich’s consciousness from beneath the vortex of flashing lights (through the dark blue breach in the crown of his head) out into stellar infinity."

"Бело-золотой старичок приходился папашею; но прилива родственных чувств Николай Аполлонович в эту минуту не испытывал вовсе; он испытывал нечто совершенно обратное, может быть, то, что испытывал он у себя в кабинете; у себя в кабинете Николай Аполлонович совершал над собой террористические акты, – номер первый над номером вторым: социалист над дворянчиком; и мертвец над влюбленным; у себя Николай Аполлонович проклинал свое бренное существо и, поскольку он был образом и подобием отца, он проклял отца. Было ясно, что богоподобие его должно было отца ненавидеть; но, быть может, бренное существо его все же любило отца? В этом Николай Аполлонович вряд ли себе признался. Любить?.. Я не знаю, подходит ли здесь это слово. Николай Аполлонович отца своего как бы чувственно знал, знал до мельчайших изгибов, до невнятных дрожаний невыразимейших чувств; более того: он был чувственно абсолютно равен отцу; более всего удивляло его то обстоятельство, что психически он не знал, где кончается он и где психически начинается в нем самом дух сенатора, носителя тех вон искристых бриллиантовых знаков, что сверкали на блещущих листьях расшитой груди. Во мгновение ока он не то что представил, а скорей пережил себя самого в этом пышном мундире; что бы он испытал, созерцая такого вот, как он, небритого разгильдяя в пестром бухарском халате; это ему показалось бы нарушением хорошего тона. Николай Аполлонович понял, что почувствовал бы брезгливость, что по-своему был бы прав родитель его, ощущая брезгливость, что брезгливость ту ощущает родитель вот сейчас – здесь. Понял и то, что смесь озлобления и стыда заставила его быстро так привскочить перед белозолотым старичком:","The white-and-gold old man was papa; but at that moment Nikolai Apollonovich did not experience a surge of kindred feelings at all; he experienced something quite the opposite, perhaps what he experienced in his office; in his office, Nikolai Apollonovich committed terrorist acts on himself - number one over number two: a socialist over a nobleman; and a dead man over a lover; at home, Nikolai Apollonovich cursed his mortal being, and since he was the image and likeness of his father, he cursed his father. It was clear that his godlikeness must have hated his father; but perhaps his mortal being still loved his father? Nikolai Apollonovich hardly admitted this to himself. Love? .. I don't know if this word is appropriate here. Nikolai Apollonovich knew his father, as it were, sensually, knew to the smallest bends, to the indistinct tremors of inexpressible feelings; moreover: he was sensually absolutely equal to his father; what surprised him most of all was the fact that mentally he did not know where he ends and where mentally begins in himself the spirit of the senator, the bearer of those sparkling diamond signs that sparkled on the shining leaves of his embroidered chest. In the twinkling of an eye, he not only imagined, but rather outlived himself in this magnificent uniform; what would he experience, contemplating such an unshaven slob like him, in a colorful Bukhara robe; it would seem to him a violation of good taste. Nikolai Apollonovich realized that he would feel disgust, that his parent would be right in his own way, feeling disgust, that the parent feels that disgust right now - here. I also understood that the mixture of anger and shame made him jump up so quickly in front of the white-golden old man:","Nikolai Apollonovich cursed his mortal self, and insofar as he was the image and likeness of his father he cursed his father.

He did not know where he ended and where in him began this senator, this wearer of sparkling decorations on a gold-embroidered chest. He did not so much picture himself as actually experience himself in the sumptuous uniform. And something compelled him to spring up before the little old man all white and gold.","The little gold and white old man was his papa; but at that moment Nikolai Apollonovich experienced no surge of familial feelings at all; he experienced something quite the contrary, perhaps that which he had experienced in his study; in his study Nikolai Apollonovich had been committing acts of terrorism on himself—number one upon number two: the socialist upon the aristocrat; the corpse upon the lover; in his study Nikolai Apollonovich had been cursing his mortal nature and, inasmuch as he was the image and likeness of his father, he cursed his father. It was clear that his godlike side was bound to hate his father; but perhaps his mortal nature loved his father all the same? Nikolai Apollonovich would hardly admit that to himself. Love? … I do not know whether that word is appropriate here. It was as though Nikolai Apollonovich knew his father sensually, knew him down to the tiniest inflections, to the imperceptible quivering of the most inexpressible feelings; and beyond that: sensually he was his father’s absolute equal; he was most of all astonished by the fact that psychically he could not tell where he finished and where in him the spirit of the senator began, the bearer of those sparkling bejewelled insignia that glistened on the gleaming leaves of his embroidered breast. In a flash he not so much imagined, as rather experienced himself in that magnificent uniform; what would he feel at the sight of an unshaven lout like himself in a multicoloured Bukhara dressing gown; it would seem to him a breach of etiquette. Nikolai Apollonovich understood that he would feel disgust, and that in his own way his father would be right to feel disgust, and that his parent was feeling such disgust precisely here and now. He also understood that it was a mixture of anger and shame that made him jump up so quickly in front of the little gold and white old man:","The white and golden little old man was his father; but at that moment Nikolai Apollonovich experienced no rush of kindred feeling at all; he was experiencing something quite the reverse – perhaps the same thing he had experienced in his office; in his office Nikolai Apollonovich performed acts of terrorism on himself – number one on number two: the socialist on the nobleman; and the corpse on the man in love; in his office Nikolai Apollonovich cursed his mortal self and, to the degree that he was the image and likeness of his father, he cursed his father. It was clear that his likeness to a god was bound to hate his father; but perhaps his mortal self loved his father all the same? Nikolai Apollonovich could scarcely bring himself to admit this to himself. Love? … I do not know if that word is apposite here. Nikolai Apollonovich knew his father as it were sympathetically, knew him down to the finest convolutions, the imperceptible tremors of inexpressible sensations; more than that; in sympathetic terms he was absolutely his father’s equal; most of all he was surprised at the fact that from a psychic point of view he did not know where the senator’s spirit ended within him and where, from a psychic point of view, it began, the spirit of him that was the wearer of those sparkling diamond insignia that flashed on the gleaming leaves of his embroidered chest. In the twinkling of an eye he did not so much imagine himself as actually experience himself in that sumptuous uniform jacket; whatever he would feel as he contemplated an unshaven sloven like himself in a multicoloured Bokhara robe would seem to him a violation of good form.

"– «А есть и такой?» – с вызовом выкрикнул Александр Иванович, собираясь выскочить из каморки и припереть посетителя, становившегося все субтильней: в эту комнату вошел плотный молодой человек, имеющий три измерения; прислонившись к окну, он стал просто контуром (и вдобавок – двухмерным); далее: стал он тонкою слойкою черной копоти, наподобие той, которая выбивает из лампы, если лампа плохо обрезана; а теперь эта черная оконная копоть, образующая человеческий контур, вся как-то серая, истлевала в блещущую луною золу; и уже зола отлетала: контур весь покрылся зелеными пятнами – просветами в пространства луны; словом: контура не было. Явное дело – здесь имело место разложение самой материи; материя эта превратилась вся, без остатка, в звуковую субстанцию, оглушительно трещавшую – только вот где? Александру Ивановичу казалось, что трещала она – в нем самом.","“Is there one like that?” - Alexander Ivanovich shouted with a challenge, intending to jump out of the closet and secure the visitor, who was becoming more and more slender: a stout young man with three dimensions entered this room; leaning against the window, he became just a contour (and in addition - two-dimensional); further: it became a thin layer of black soot, like the one that knocks out of a lamp if the lamp is poorly cut; and now this black window soot, forming a human contour, all somehow gray, decayed into ash shining with the moon; and already the ashes were flying away: the entire contour was covered with green spots - gaps in the space of the moon; in a word: there was no contour. Clearly, here the decomposition of matter itself took place; this matter turned all, without a trace, into a sound substance, deafeningly crackling - but where? It seemed to Alexander Ivanovich that she was crackling - in himself.","“Is there such a thing?” shrieked Alexander Ivanovich, as he made ready to leap out of his cubbyhole and lock in the visitor who was growing ever more subtile. A man of all three dimensions had entered the room. He had leaned against the window and had become a contour (or, two-dimensional), had become a thin layer of soot of the sort you knock out of a lamp. Now this black soot had suddenly smoldered away into an ash that gleamed in the moonlight, and the ash was flying away. And there was no contour. The whole material substance had turned into a phonic substance that was jabbering away. But where? It seemed to Alexander Ivanovich that the jabbering had now started up inside him.","“Is there such a thing?” Alexandr Ivanovich cried out provocatively, making ready to slip out of his cubby-hole and shut the visitor in, who was becoming ever more subtle: into this room had come a portly young man possessing three dimensions; leaning against the window he had turned into nothing but an outline (and moreover—of two dimensions); then: he had become a thin layer of black soot, rather like that which emerges from an oil-lamp if it has been badly trimmed; and now this black soot on the window, forming a human outline, grey all over, was decomposing into ash, glinting in the moonlight; and now the ash was blowing away: the outline was covered all over with patches of green—apertures into the spaces of the moon; in short: the outline was not there. It was obvious—what was happening here was the dissolution of matter itself; this matter had been transformed entirely, without residue, into a sonic substance, clattering deafeningly—only where? It seemed to Alexandr Ivanovich that it was clattering inside himself.","‘But is there such a thing?’ Aleksandr Ivanovich shrieked with defiance, preparing to leap out of the cupboard of a room and lock the visitor in, a visitor who was becoming ever more subtle: into this room came a thickset young man who possessed three dimensions; as he leaned against the window he became simply a contour (and, in addition: two-dimensional); moreover: he became a thin layer of black soot, like the one that falls out of a lamp if the lamp is badly trimmed; and now this black window soot, forming a human contour, grey all over, was smouldering to ash that gleamed in the moonlight; and already the ash had smouldered away: the contour was entirely covered in green blotches – openings into the spaces of the moon; in a word: there was no contour. The fact of it was plain – here the decomposition of matter itself was taking place; that matter had turned, all of it, without residue, into a substance of sound that jabbered deafeningly – only where? To Aleksandr Ivanovich it seemed that it was jabbering inside himself."
