"Со своей стороны Чичиков оглянул также, насколько позволяло приличие, брата Василия. Он был ростом пониже Платона, волосом темней его и лицом далеко не так красив; но в чертах его лица было много жизни и одушевленья. Видно было, что он не пребывал в дремоте и спячке.","For his part, Chichikov also looked, as far as decency would allow, at Brother Vasily. He was shorter than Plato, his hair was darker than his, and his face was far from being so handsome; but there was much life and animation in the features of his face. It was evident that he was not in slumber and hibernation.","Tchitchikov for his part scrutinised “brother Vassily” so far as good manners would permit. He was shorter than Platonov, had darker hair, and was altogether far less handsome; but there was a great deal of life and animation in his face. It was evident that he did not spend his time in lethargy and depression.","Chichikov returned Vassili’s scrutiny with a similar observance of the dictates of civility, and perceived that he was shorter than Platon, that his hair was of a darker shade, and that his features, though less handsome, contained far more life, animation, and kindliness than did his brother’s.","For his part, Chichikov also looked brother Vassily over as far as decency allowed. He was shorter than Platon, his hair was darker, and his face far less handsome; but in the features of his face there was much life and animation.

"— Пожалуй, вот вам еще пятнадцать, итого двадцать. Пожалуйте только расписку.","- Perhaps, here's another fifteen for you, twenty in total. Please only receipt.","Tchitchikov was about to protest that he had not got it; but Sobakevitch declared with such conviction that he had, that he brought out another note, saying: “Here is another fifteen roubles for you, making twenty-five altogether. But please give me a receipt.”","“Kindly give me a receipt for the money,” he added. “A receipt?","“Oh, well, here’s another fifteen for you, twenty-five in all. Only give me a receipt, please.”","Chichikov began making excuses that he did not have that much with him, but Sobakevich told him so affirmatively that he did have the money that Chichikov took out another note and said: “Here are fifteen more, if you like, a total of twenty-five. But please let me have a receipt.”"

"— Простите, Павел Иванович, я виноват! — сказал тронутый Тентетников, схвативши признательно обе его руки. — Ваше доброе участие мне дорого, клянусь! Но оставим этот разговор, не будем больше никогда об этом говорить.","“Excuse me, Pavel Ivanovich, it’s my fault!” said the touched Tentetnikov, grasping both his hands gratefully. Your kind participation is dear to me, I swear! But let's leave this conversation, we will never talk about it again.","“Forgive me, Pavel Ivanovitch, I was to blame!” said Tyentyetnikov, genuinely touched, taking both his hands gratefully “Your kind sympathy is precious to me, I assure you! But let us drop this subject, let us never speak of it again!”","“A strange fellow, this Tientietnikov!” thought Chichikov, and then added aloud: “Yes, I will go and see him at ten o’clock to-morrow; but since my britchka is not yet altogether in travelling order, would you be so good as to lend me your koliaska for the purpose?”","“Forgive me, Pavel Ivanovich, I am to blame!” Tentetnikov said, touched, and seizing both his hands in gratitude. “Your kind sympathy is precious to me, I swear!

"— Это не поступок, Андрей Иванович. Это просто генеральская привычка: они всем говорят ты. Да, впрочем, уж почему этого и не позволить заслуженному, почтенному человеку?","— This is not an act, Andrey Ivanovich. It's just a general habit: they say you to everyone. Yes, however, why not allow this to a well-deserved, respectable person?","“It’s not behaviour, Andrey Ivanovitch. It’s simply a habit with generals: they say thou to everybody. Besides why not allow it in an honourable and distinguished man?”","“I tell you what,” resumed Chichikov. “To-morrow I myself will go and see the General.” “To what purpose?” asked Tientietnikov, with astonishment and distrust in his eyes.","“It’s not an action, Andrei Ivanovich. It’s simply a general’s habit: they call everyone ‘boy.’ And, incidentally, why not allow it in a venerable, respectable man?”",
"— Ах, прелести! Так он за старуху принялся. Ну, хорош же после этого вкус наших дам, нашли в кого влюбиться.","- Ah, charms! So he took up the old woman. Well, the taste of our ladies is good after that, they found someone to fall in love with.","“Oh, how charming! So he’s after an old lady? It speaks well for the taste of our ladies; they have pitched on a nice person to fall in love with.”",“Splendid indeed! So he is actually engaged to a person like that?

"В самом деле, необыкновенно странны были своею противуположностью те чувства, которые родились в сердцах троих беседовавших людей. Одному была смешна неповоротливая ненаходчивость немца. Другому смешно было оттого, что смешно изворотились плуты. Третьему было грустно, что безнаказанно совершился несправедливый поступок. Не было только четвертого, который бы задумался именно над этими словами, произведшими смех в одном и грусть с другом. Что значит, однако же, что и в паденье своем гибнущий грязный человек требует любви к себе? Животный ли инстинкт это? или слабый крик души, заглушённой тяжелым гнетом подлых страстей, еще пробивающийся сквозь деревенеющую кору мерзостей, еще вопиющий: «Брат, спаси!» Не было четвертого, которому бы тяжелей всего была погибающая душа его брата.","In fact, those feelings that were born in the hearts of the three people who were talking were unusually strange in their opposite. One was laughing at the German's unwieldy sluggishness. To another it was funny because the rogues twisted funny. The third was sad that an unjust act had been committed with impunity. There was not only a fourth who would have thought about these very words, which produced laughter in one and sadness in another. What does it mean, however, that even in his fall a perishing dirty man demands love for himself? Is it animal instinct? or a weak cry of the soul, muffled by the heavy oppression of vile passions, still breaking through the woody bark of abominations, still crying out: “Brother, save me!” There was no fourth, to whom the perishing soul of his brother would be the hardest.","And indeed the feelings in the hearts of the three persons were extremely strange in their incongruity. One was amused by the uncompromising tactlessness of the German; another was amused at the funny trick the rogues had played; the third was distressed that an injustice had been committed with impunity. All that was lacking was a fourth to ponder over these words which aroused laughter in one and sadness in the other. For what is the significance of the fact that even in his degradation, a man besmirched and going to his ruin claims still to be loved? Is it an animal instinct or the faint cry of a soul stifled under the heavy burden of base passions, still breaking through the hardening crust of vileness, still wailing: “Brother, save me!” There was no fourth for whom the ruin of a brother’s soul was bitterest of all.","Chichikov bowed so low and so long that, by the time that his eyes had ceased to see nothing but his own boots, the General’s daughter had disappeared, and in her place was standing a bewhiskered butler, armed with a silver soap-dish and a hand-basin.","Indeed, of extraordinarily strange contrast were the feelings born in the hearts of the three conversing people. One found amusing the awkward ineptitude of the German. Another found amusing the amusing way the crooks wriggled out of it. The third was saddened that an unjust act had been committed with impunity. There only lacked a fourth to ponder precisely such words as could produce laughter in one and sadness in another. What does it mean, however, that even in his fall, the perishing dirty man demands to be loved? Is it an animal instinct? or the faint cry of the soul smothered under the heavy burden of base passions, still trying to break through the hardening crust of abominations , still crying: “Save me, brother!” There lacked a fourth for whom the most painful thing of all would be his brother’s perishing soul.",

Chichikov was for setting forth again, but the roads had now got into a bad state, and, in addition, there was in preparation a second fair—one for the dvoriane only. The former fair had been held for the sale of horses, cattle, cheese, and other peasant produce, and the buyers had been merely cattle-jobbers and kulaks; but this time the function was to be one for the sale of manorial produce which had been bought up by wholesale dealers at Nizhni Novgorod, and then transferred hither. To the fair, of course, came those ravishers of the Russian purse who, in the shape of Frenchmen with pomades and Frenchwomen with hats, make away with money earned by blood and hard work, and, like the locusts of Egypt (to use Kostanzhoglo’s term) not only devour their prey, but also dig holes in the ground and leave behind their eggs.","“To confuse, to confuse—nothing more,” the philosopher replied, “to introduce into the case some other, unrelated circumstances that will entangle other people in it, to make it complicated—nothing more.

"Слова эти и решимость на минуту успокоили Леницына. Он был очень взволнован и уже начинал было подозревать, не было ли со стороны Чичикова какой-нибудь фабрикации относительно завещания. Теперь укорил себя в подозрении. Готовность присягнуть была явным доказательством, что Чичиков невинен. Не знаем мы, точно ли достало бы духу у Павла Ивановича присягнуть на святом, но сказать это достало духа.","These words and determination calmed Lenin for a moment. He was very agitated and was already beginning to suspect that there was some fabrication on the part of Chichikov regarding the will. Now he reproached himself with suspicion. The readiness to swear was clear evidence that Chichikov was innocent. We do not know whether Pavel Ivanovich would have had enough spirit to swear on the saint, but to say this he had the spirit.","These words and the air of decision with which they were uttered reassured Lyenitsyn. He had been much perturbed and had almost been suspecting there might have been something underhand on Tchitchikov’s part in regard to the will (though of course he could never have conceived what had really happened). Now he reproached himself with being suspicious. His readiness to take an oath seemed a clear proof that Tchitchikov ... We cannot say if Pavel Ivanovitch would really have had the hardihood to take a solemn oath about it, but he had the hardihood to say that he would.","It has made only too good a shot, the cussed young ragamuffin!”","These words and his resoluteness set Lenitsyn at ease for the moment.

Yet that is how certain of our landowners are now carrying on. They have set up ‘offices’ and factories and schools and ‘commissions,’ and the devil knows what else besides. A fine lot of wiseacres! After the French War in 1812 they had to reconstruct their affairs: and see how they have done it! Yet so much worse have they done it than a Frenchman would have done that any fool of a Peter Petrovitch Pietukh now ranks as a good landowner!” “But he has mortgaged the whole of his estate?” remarked Chichikov. “Yes, nowadays everything is being mortgaged, or is going to be.” This said, Kostanzhoglo’s temper rose still further. “Out upon your factories of hats and candles!” he cried. “Out upon procuring candle-makers from London, and then turning landowners into hucksters! To think of a Russian pomiestchik 49, a member of the noblest of callings, conducting workshops and cotton mills! Why, it is for the wenches of towns to handle looms for muslin and lace.”","“That’s still nothing!” said Kostanzhoglo. “Koshkarev is a comforting phenomenon. He’s necessary, because the follies of clever people are made more obvious by the caricature of their reflection in him. They’ve set up offices, and institutions, and managers, and manufactures, and factories, and schools, and commissions, and devil knows what else. As if they had some sort of state of their own! How do you like this , I ask you? A landowner who has arable land and not enough peasants to work it, started a candle factory, invited master candlemakers from London, and became a merchant! There’s an even bigger fool: he started a silk factory!”",
"Чичиков так занялся разговорами с дамами, или, лучше, дамы так заняли и закружили его своими разговорами, подсыпая кучу самых замысловатых и тонких аллегорий, которые все нужно было разгадывать, отчего даже выступил у него на лбу пот, — что он позабыл исполнить долг приличия и подойти прежде всего к хозяйке. Вспомнил он об этом уже тогда, когда услышал голос самой губернаторши, стоявшей перед ним уже несколько минут. Губернаторша произнесла несколько ласковым и лукавым голосом с приятным потряхиванием головы: «А, Павел Иванович, так вот как вы!..» В точности не могу передать слов губернаторши, но было сказано что-то исполненное большой любезности, в том духе, в котором изъясняются дамы и кавалеры в повестях наших светских писателей, охотников описывать гостиные и похвалиться знанием высшего тона, в духе того, что «неужели овладели так вашим сердцем, что в нем нет более ни места, ни самого тесного уголка для безжалостно позабытых вами». Герой наш поворотился в ту ж минуту к губернаторше и уже готов был отпустить ей ответ, вероятно ничем не хуже тех, какие отпускают в модных повестях Звонские, Линские, Лидипы, Гремины и всякие ловкие военные люди, как, невзначай поднявши глаза, остановился вдруг, будто оглушенный ударом.","Chichikov was so busy talking to the ladies, or, better, the ladies so occupied and swirled him with their conversations, adding a bunch of the most intricate and subtle allegories that everyone had to figure out, which even made sweat on his forehead - that he forgot to fulfill the duty of decency and approach the hostess first. He remembered this already when he heard the voice of the governor's wife herself, who had been standing in front of him for several minutes. The governor's wife uttered in a somewhat affectionate and sly voice with a pleasant shake of her head: ""Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, so that's how you are! .."" ladies and gentlemen speak in the stories of our secular writers, hunters to describe living rooms and boast of knowledge of a higher tone, in the spirit of “have they really taken possession of your heart so that there is no longer any place in it, not even the cramped corner for those ruthlessly forgotten by you.” Our hero turned at that very moment to the governor's wife and was ready to give her an answer, probably no worse than those that the Zvonskys, Linskys, Lidips, Gremins and all sorts of clever military people give in fashionable stories, when, casually raising his eyes, he suddenly stopped, as if stunned by a blow.","Tchitchikov was so absorbed in his conversation with the ladies, or to be more accurate, the ladies so engrossed and overwhelmed him with their conversation, interspersing a number of ingenious and subtly allegorical remarks—his brow was perspiring with the effort to interpret their meaning—that he forgot the rules of good manners and did not go up first to his hostess. He thought of this only when he heard the voice of the governor’s wife who had been standing before him for some minutes. The lady, shaking her head archly, said in a rather caressing and insinuating voice: “Ah, so this is where you are, Pavel Ivanovitch!” I cannot accurately reproduce the lady’s words, but something was said, full of the greatest politeness, in the style in which ladies and gentlemen express themselves in the works of the society novelists who devote themselves to describing drawing-rooms and pride themselves on their knowledge of aristocratic manners, something in the style of—“Have they taken such possession of your heart that you have no room left in it, not even the tiniest corner for those you have so mercilessly forgotten?” Our hero instantly faced about to the governor’s wife, and was on the point of making a reply, probably in no way inferior to those uttered by the Zvonskys, the Linskys, the Lindins, the Gremins and all the other accomplished officers in fashionable novels, when, chancing to raise his eyes, he stood rooted to the spot.","So deeply did Chichikov become plunged in conversation with his fair pursuers—or rather, so deeply did those fair pursuers enmesh him in the toils of small talk (which they accomplished through the expedient of asking him endless subtle riddles which brought the sweat to his brow in his attempts to guess them)—that he forgot the claims of courtesy which required him first of all to greet his hostess. In fact, he remembered those claims only on hearing the Governor’s wife herself addressing him. She had been standing before him for several minutes, and now greeted him with suave expressement and the words, “So HERE you are, Paul Ivanovitch!” But what she said next I am not in a position to report, for she spoke in the ultra-refined tone and vein wherein ladies and gentlemen customarily express themselves in high-class novels which have been written by experts more qualified than I am to describe salons, and able to boast of some acquaintance with good society. In effect, what the Governor’s wife said was that she hoped—she greatly hoped—that Monsieur Chichikov’s heart still contained a corner—even the smallest possible corner—for those whom he had so cruelly forgotten. Upon that Chichikov turned to her, and was on the point of returning a reply at least no worse than that which would have been returned, under similar circumstances, by the hero of a fashionable novelette, when he stopped short, as though thunderstruck.","Chichikov was so taken up by his conversations with the ladies—or, better, the ladies so took him up and whirled him around with their conversations, adding a heap of the most fanciful and subtle allegories, which all had to be penetrated, even making sweat stand out on his brow—that he forgot to fulfill his duty to propriety and go up to the hostess first of all. He remembered it only when he heard the voice of the governor’s wife herself, who had been standing before him for several minutes. She said in a somewhat tender and coy voice, accompanied by a pleasant shaking of the head: “ Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, so that’s how you are!…” I cannot convey the lady’s words exactly, something was said full of great courtesy, in the spirit in which ladies and gentlemen express themselves in the novellas of our society writers, who love to describe drawing rooms and boast of their knowledge of high tone, in the spirit of: “Can it be that your heart is so possessed that there is no longer any room, not even the tiniest corner, for those whom you have mercilessly forgotten?” Our hero turned to the governor’s wife that same instant and was ready to deliver his reply, probably in no way inferior to those delivered in fashionable novels by the Zvonskys, the Linskys, the Lidins, the Gremins, and various other adroit military men, when, chancing to raise his eyes, he stopped suddenly, as if stunned by a blow.","Chichikov became so engrossed in conversations with the ladies, or to put it better, the ladies engrossed him so and put his head in such a whirl with their conversations, which they peppered with such a lot of the most intricate and refined allegories—all of which had to be interpreted, the effort of which caused his forehead to become actually beaded with sweat—that he had forgotten to fulfill an obligation of good manners: that of approaching his hostess first of all. He recalled this remissness only when he heard the voice of the good lady herself, who had been standing before him for several minutes by now. The Governor’s lady uttered in a somewhat kindly and arch voice, with an agreeable toss of her head: “Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, so that’s how you are!” I cannot convey the exact words of the Governor’s lady, but something full of great amiability was said, in that spirit in which the ladies and gallants make themselves understood in the works of our writers of society tales (who are great hands at and fond of describing salons and of boasting a knowledge of the highest ton), in some such vein as: “Can it be possible that others have taken such possession of your heart that there is no longer any room therein—nay, not the tiniest nook!—for those whom you have so compassionlessly forgotten?” Our hero instantly turned to the Governor’s lady and was all set to deliver his answer to her—an answer probably in no way inferior to those which are delivered in the fashionable novels by the Zvonskiis, Linskiis, Lidins, Gremins, and all sorts of adroit military men—when, chancing to raise his eyes, he was suddenly rooted to the spot as if thunderstruck."
"— А тебя как бы нарядить немцем да в капор! — сказал Петрушка, острясь над Селифаном и ухмыльнувшись. Но что за рожа вышла из этой усмешки! И подобья не было на усмешку, а точно как бы человек, доставши себе в нос насморк и силясь при насморке чихнуть, не чихнул, но так и остался в положенье человека, собирающегося чихнуть.","- And how would you dress up as a German and in a hood! said Petrushka, making fun of Selifan and grinning. But what a face came out of this grin! And there was no resemblance to a smile, but as if a person, having got a runny nose in his nose and trying to sneeze with a runny nose, did not sneeze, but remained in the position of a person about to sneeze.","“I should like to see you dressed up like a German and in a kapor!” said Petrushka, by way of a gibe at Selifan, and he grinned. But a queer face he made when he grinned! And there was not the slightest semblance of a grin, he looked like a man who has caught a bad cold and is trying to sneeze but cannot sneeze, and remains with a fixed expression of trying to sneeze.","This said, Chichikov added to himself, smoothing his chin: “What a difference between the features of a civilised man of the world and those of a common lacquey!”","“What if they got you up like a German, and in a bonnet!” Petrushka said, sharpening his wit on Selifan and grinning. But what a mug resulted from this grin! It had no semblance of a grin, but was as if a man with a cold in his nose was trying to sneeze, but did not sneeze, and simply remained in the position of a man about to sneeze.",
"— Душенька, рекомендую тебе, — продолжал Собакевич, — Павел Иванович Чичиков! У губернатора и почтмейстера имел честь познакомиться.","“Darling, I recommend you,” continued Sobakevich, “Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov!” I had the honor of meeting the governor and the postmaster.","“My love,” Sobakevitch went on, “let me introduce Pavel Ivanovitch Tchitchikov; I had the honour of making his acquaintance at the governor’s and at the police-captain’s.”","“My dear, allow me to introduce Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov,” added Sobakevitch. “He has the honour of being acquainted both with our Governor and with our Postmaster.”","“Sweetie,” Sobakevich went on, “allow me to introduce Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov! I had the honor of meeting him at the governor’s and at the postmaster’s.”","“Allow me to introduce, you, my little pet,” Sobakevich continued. “This is Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov! I had the honor of making his acquaintance at the Governor’s and the Postmaster’s.”"
"Покамест слуги управлялись и возились, господин отправился в общую залу. Какие бывают эти общие залы — всякий проезжающий знает очень хорошо: те же стены, выкрашенные масляной краской, потемневшие вверху от трубочного дыма и залосненные снизу спинами разных проезжающих, а еще более туземными купеческими, ибо купцы по торговым дням приходили сюда сам-шест и сам-сём испивать свою известную пару чаю; тот же закопченный потолок; та же копченая люстра со множеством висящих стеклышек, которые прыгали и звенели всякий раз, когда половой бегал по истертым клеенкам, помахивая бойко подносом, на котором сидела такая же бездна чайных чашек, как птиц на морском берегу; те же картины во всю стену, писанные масляными красками, — словом, все то же, что и везде; только и разницы, что на одной картине изображена была нимфа с такими огромными грудями, какие читатель, верно, никогда не видывал. Подобная игра природы, впрочем, случается на разных исторических картинах, неизвестно в какое время, откуда и кем привезенных к нам в Россию, иной раз даже нашими вельможами, любителями искусств, накупившими их в Италии по совету везших их курьеров. Господин скинул с себя картуз и размотал с шеи шерстяную, радужных цветов косынку, какую женатым приготовляет своими руками супруга, снабжая приличными наставлениями, как закутываться, а холостым — наверное не могу сказать, кто делает, бог их знает, я никогда не носил таких косынок. Размотавши косынку, господин велел подать себе обед. Покамест ему подавались разные обычные в трактирах блюда, как-то: щи с слоеным пирожком, нарочно сберегаемым для проезжающих в течение нескольких неделей, мозги с горошком, сосиски с капустой, пулярка жареная, огурец соленый и вечный слоеный сладкий пирожок, всегда готовый к услугам; покамест ему все это подавалось и разогретое, и просто холодное, он заставил слугу, или полового, рассказывать всякий вздор — о том, кто содержал прежде трактир и кто теперь, и много ли дает дохода, и большой ли подлец их хозяин; на что половой, по обыкновению, отвечал: «О, большой, сударь, мошенник». Как в просвещенной Европе, так и в просвещенной России есть теперь весьма много почтенных людей, которые без того не могут покушать в трактире, чтоб не поговорить с слугою, а иногда даже забавно пошутить над ним. Впрочем, приезжий делал не всё пустые вопросы; он с чрезвычайною точностию расспросил, кто в городе губернатор, кто председатель палаты, кто прокурор, — словом, не пропустил ни одного значительного чиновника; но еще с большею точностию, если даже не с участием, расспросил обо всех значительных помещиках: сколько кто имеет душ крестьян, как далеко живет от города, какого даже характера и как часто приезжает в город; расспросил внимательно о состоянии края: не было ли каких болезней в их губернии — повальных горячек, убийственных какие-либо лихорадок, оспы и тому подобного, и все так обстоятельно и с такою точностию, которая показывала более, чем одно простое любопытство. В приемах своих господин имел что-то солидное и высмаркивался чрезвычайно громко. Неизвестно, как он это делал, но только нос его звучал, как труба. Это, по-моему, совершенно невинное достоинство приобрело, однако ж, ему много уважения со стороны трактирного слуги, так что он всякий раз, когда слышал этот звук, встряхивал волосами, выпрямливался почтительнее и, нагнувши с вышины свою голову, спрашивал: не нужно ли чего? После обеда господин выкушал чашку кофею и сел на диван, подложивши себе за спину подушку, которую в русских трактирах вместо эластической шерсти набивают чем-то чрезвычайно похожим на кирпич и булыжник. Тут начал он зевать и приказал отвести себя в свой нумер, где, прилегши, заснул два часа. Отдохнувши, он написал на лоскутке бумажки, по просьбе трактирного слуги, чин, имя и фамилию для сообщения куда следует, в полицию. На бумажке половой, спускаясь с лестницы, прочитал по складам следующее: «Коллежский советник Павел Иванович Чичиков, помещик, по своим надобностям». Когда половой все еще разбирал по складам записку, сам Павел Иванович Чичиков отправился посмотреть город, которым был, как казалось, удовлетворен, ибо нашел, что город никак не уступал другим губернским городам: сильно била в глаза желтая краска на каменных домах и скромно темнела серая на деревянных. Домы были в один, два и полтора этажа, с вечным мезонином, очень красивым, по мнению губернских архитекторов. Местами эти дома казались затерянными среди широкой, как поле, улицы и нескончаемых деревянных заборов; местами сбивались в кучу, и здесь было заметно более движения народа и живости. Попадались почти смытые дождем вывески с кренделями и сапогами, кое-где с нарисованными синими брюками и подписью какого-то Аршавского портного; где магазин с картузами, фуражками и надписью: «Иностранец Василий Федоров»; где нарисован был бильярд с двумя игроками во фраках, в какие одеваются у нас на театрах гости, входящие в последнем акте на сцену. Игроки были изображены с прицелившимися киями, несколько вывороченными назад руками и косыми ногами, только что сделавшими на воздухе антраша. Под всем этим было написано: «И вот заведение». Кое-где просто на улице стояли столы с орехами, мылом и пряниками, похожими на мыло; где харчевня с нарисованною толстою рыбою и воткнутою в нее вилкою. Чаще же всего заметно было потемневших двуглавых государственных орлов, которые теперь уже заменены лаконическою надписью: «Питейный дом». Мостовая везде была плоховата. Он заглянул и в городской сад, который состоял из тоненьких дерев, дурно принявшихся, с подпорками внизу, в виде треугольников, очень красиво выкрашенных зеленою масляною краскою. Впрочем, хотя эти деревца были не выше тростника, о них было сказано в газетах при описании иллюминации, что «город наш украсился, благодаря попечению гражданского правителя, садом, состоящим из тенистых, широковетвистых дерев, дающих прохладу в знойный день», и что при этом «было очень умилительно глядеть, как сердца граждан трепетали в избытке благодарности и струили потоки слез в знак признательности к господину градоначальнику». Расспросивши подробно будочника, куда можно пройти ближе, если понадобится, к собору, к присутственным местам, к губернатору, он отправился взглянуть на реку, протекавшую посредине города, дорогою оторвал прибитую к столбу афишу, с тем чтобы, пришедши домой, прочитать ее хорошенько, посмотрел пристально на проходившую по деревянному тротуару даму недурной наружности, за которой следовал мальчик в военной ливрее, с узелком в руке, и, еще раз окинувши все глазами, как бы с тем, чтобы хорошо припомнить положение места, отправился домой прямо в свой нумер, поддерживаемый слегка на лестнице трактирным слугою. Накушавшись чаю, он уселся перед столом, велел подать себе свечу, вынул из кармана афишу, поднес ее к свече и стал читать, прищуря немного правый глаз. Впрочем, замечательного немного было в афишке: давалась драма г. Коцебу, в которой Ролла играл г. Поплёвин, Кору — девица Зяблова, прочие лица были и того менее замечательны; однако же он прочел их всех, добрался даже до цены партера и узнал, что афиша была напечатана в типографии губернского правления, потом переворотил на другую сторону: узнать, нет ли и там чего-нибудь, но, не нашедши ничего, протер глаза, свернул опрятно и положил в свой ларчик, куда имел обыкновение складывать все, что ни попадалось. День, кажется, был заключен порцией холодной телятины, бутылкою кислых щей и крепким сном во всю насосную завертку, как выражаются в иных местах обширного русского государства.","While the servants were managing and fussing, the master went to the common room. What these common halls are like, anyone passing by knows very well: the same walls, painted with oil paint, darkened at the top from pipe smoke and greasy from below with the backs of various travelers, and even more native merchants, for merchants on trading days came here on their own pole and on their own -this is to drink their famous pair of tea; the same sooty ceiling; the same smoked chandelier with many hanging pieces of glass that jumped and tinkled every time the floorman ran over the worn oilcloths, waving smartly at the tray, on which sat the same abyss of teacups, like birds on the seashore; the same wall-to-wall paintings, painted with oil paints - in a word, everything is the same as everywhere else; the only difference is that in one picture there was a nymph with such huge breasts as the reader has probably never seen. A similar play of nature, however, happens in various historical paintings, it is not known at what time, from where and by whom they were brought to us in Russia, sometimes even by our nobles, art lovers who bought them in Italy on the advice of the couriers who brought them. The gentleman threw off his cap and unwound from his neck a woolen, rainbow-colored scarf, which the wife prepares with her own hands for the married, providing decent instructions on how to wrap up, and for the unmarried - I probably can’t say who makes it, God knows them, I never wore such scarves . Having unwound the scarf, the gentleman ordered dinner to be served. In the meantime, various dishes usual in taverns were served to him, such as: cabbage soup with a puff pastry, specially saved for passing through for several weeks, brains with peas, sausages with cabbage, fried poulard, pickled cucumber and eternal puff pastry, always ready for service. ; while all this was served to him, both warmed up and simply cold, he forced the servant, or the servant, to tell all sorts of nonsense - about who ran the tavern before and who now, and how much income they make, and whether their owner is a big scoundrel; to which the sexual, as usual, answered: ""Oh, big, sir, swindler."" As in enlightened Europe, so in enlightened Russia there are now quite a lot of respectable people who, without that, cannot eat in a tavern, so as not to talk with a servant, and sometimes even play a funny joke on him. However, the newcomer did not ask all empty questions; he asked with extreme precision who was the governor in the city, who was the chairman of the chamber, who was the prosecutor - in a word, he did not miss a single significant official; but with even greater accuracy, if not even with participation, he asked about all the significant landowners: how many people have the souls of peasants, how far they live from the city, even what character and how often they come to the city; he asked carefully about the state of the region: were there any diseases in their province - epidemic fevers, any murderous fevers, smallpox, and the like, and everything was so detailed and with such accuracy that showed more than one simple curiosity. In his receptions, the gentleman had something solid and blew his nose extremely loudly. It is not known how he did it, but only his nose sounded like a pipe. This, in my opinion, completely innocent dignity, however, gained him a lot of respect on the part of the tavern servant, so that every time he heard this sound, he shook his hair, straightened himself more respectfully and, bending his head from on high, asked: it is not necessary what? After dinner, the gentleman drank a cup of coffee and sat down on the sofa, placing a pillow behind his back, which in Russian taverns is stuffed with something extremely similar to brick and cobblestone instead of elastic wool. Then he began to yawn and ordered to be taken to his room, where, lying down, he fell asleep for two hours. Having rested, he wrote on a piece of paper, at the request of the tavern servant, the rank, name and surname for the message to the right place, to the police. On a piece of paper, going down the stairs, the floorman read the following from the warehouses: ""College adviser Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, landowner, according to his needs."" When the officer was still sorting through the note, Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov himself went to see the city, which he seemed to be satisfied with, for he found that the city was in no way inferior to other provincial cities: the yellow paint on the stone houses was strongly striking in the eyes and the gray was modestly darkening. on wooden ones. The houses were one, two and one and a half stories high, with an eternal mezzanine, very beautiful, according to provincial architects. In places, these houses seemed lost among the wide, field-like streets and endless wooden fences; in some places they crowded together, and here there was noticeably more movement of the people and liveliness. There were signs almost washed away by the rain with pretzels and boots, in some places with painted blue trousers and the signature of some Arshavian tailor; where is the store with caps, caps and the inscription: ""Foreigner Vasily Fedorov""; where a billiards table was drawn with two players in tailcoats, in which guests at our theaters dress when they enter the stage in the last act. The players were depicted with aiming cues, arms slightly turned back and slanting legs, which had just made an entrechat in the air. Beneath it all was written: ""And here is the establishment."" Here and there, just outside, there were tables with nuts, soap, and gingerbread that looked like soap; where is a tavern with a painted fat fish and a fork stuck in it. Most often, the darkened double-headed state eagles were noticeable, which have now been replaced by a laconic inscription: ""Drinking House"". The pavement was bad everywhere. He also looked into the city garden, which consisted of thin trees, badly taken, with props below, in the form of triangles, very beautifully painted with green oil paint. However, although these trees were not taller than reeds, it was said about them in the newspapers when describing the illumination, that “our city was decorated, thanks to the care of the civil ruler, with a garden consisting of shady, broad-branched trees, giving coolness on a hot day,” and that with In this ""it was very touching to watch how the hearts of citizens trembled in abundance of gratitude and streamed tears in gratitude to the mayor."" After asking the watchman in detail where he could go closer, if necessary, to the cathedral, to government offices, to the governor, he went to look at the river flowing in the middle of the city, on the way he tore off the poster nailed to the post, so that when he came home, he could read it carefully, looked intently at a lady of not bad appearance walking along the wooden pavement, followed by a boy in military livery, with a bundle in his hand, and, once again looking around everything with his eyes, as if in order to remember the position of the place well, he went home straight to his room, supported lightly on the stairs by a tavern servant. Having drunk his tea, he sat down in front of the table, ordered a candle to be brought to him, took a poster out of his pocket, held it up to the candle, and began to read, screwing up his right eye a little. However, there was little remarkable in the poster: a drama was given by Mr. Kotzebue, in which Roll was played by Mr. Poplevin, Kora was the maiden Zyablov, other faces were even less remarkable; however, he read them all, even got to the price of the stalls and found out that the poster had been printed in the printing house of the provincial government, then he turned it over to the other side: to find out if there was something there, but, not finding anything, he rubbed his eyes, turned neatly and put it in his chest, where he used to put everything that came across. The day seems to have ended with a portion of cold veal, a bottle of sour cabbage soup, and a sound sleep in the whole pump wrap, as they say in other places of the vast Russian state.","While the servants were busy arranging things, their master went to the common room. Every traveller knows very well what these common rooms are like. There were the usual painted walls, blackened above by smoke from the chimney, and glossy below from the backs of travellers of all sorts and more particularly of merchants of the district, for on market days merchants used to come here, in parties of six or seven, to drink their regular two cups of tea; there was the usual grimy ceiling, the usual smutty chandelier with a multitude of little hanging glass lustresg which danced and tinkled every time the waiter ran over the shabby oilcloth, briskly flourishing a tray with as many teacups perched on it as birds on the seashore; there were the usual pictures, painted in oil, all over the walls; in short everything was the same as it is everywhere, the only difference was that in one of the pictures a nymph was portrayed with a bosom more immense than the reader has probably ever seen. Such freaks of nature, however, occur in all sorts of historical pictures which have been imported into Russia, there is no knowing at what date, from what place or by whom, though sometimes they are brought us by our grand gentlemen, lovers of the arts, who have purchased them in Italy on the advice of their couriers. The gentleman removed his cap and unwound from his neck a woollen shawl of rainbow hues such as married men are provided with by their wives, who add to those gifts suitable exhortations about wrapping themselves up. Who does the same for bachelors I cannot say for certain , God only knows: I have never worn such a shawl myself When he had removed the shawl the gentleman ordered dinner. While they were serving him with various dishes usual in restaurants, such as cabbage soup with little pies of puff paste purposely kept for weeks in readiness for visitors, brains with peas, sausages with cabbage, roast pullet, salt cucumbers, and the eternal sweet puffs which are always at one’s service; while all these things were being set before him, some warmed up and some cold, he made the servant, or waiter, tell him all sorts of foolish things, such as who used to keep the hotel and who kept it now, and whether it was profitable and whether his master were a great rascal, to which the waiter made the usual answer: “Oh, he is a great swindler, sir!” Both in enlightened Europe and in enlightened Russia there are nowadays many worthy persons who cannot eat in a restaurant without talking to waiters and sometimes even making amusing jokes at their expense. The questions put by the traveller were however not altogether foolish. He inquired with marked particularity who was the governor, who was president of the court of justice, who was the public prosecutor, in short he did not omit to inquire about a single one of the more important local officials, and with even greater particularity, even with marked interest he inquired about all the country gentlemen of consequence: how many souls of peasantsh each owned, how far from the town he lived, what were his characteristics and how often he visited the town. He made careful inquiries concerning the health of the countryside, whether there were any complaints in the province—such as epidemics, fevers, small-pox and such like, and all this with a preciseness which betrayed more than simple curiosity. The gentleman had something solid and respectable in his manners and he blew his nose extremely loud. I cannot say how he did it, but his nose resounded like a trumpet. This apparently innocent merit gained him much respect from the waiter, for every time he heard the sound he shook his locks, drew himself up more respectfully, and bending his head inquired whether he wanted anything. After dinner the gentleman drank a cup of coffee and sat on the sofa, propping his back against one of those cushions which in Russian hotels are stuffed not with supple wool but with something extraordinarily like bricks and pebbles. At this point he began to yawn and bade the waiter take him to his room, where he lay down and slept for a couple of hours. When he had rested he wrote, at the request of the waiter, on a slip of paper, his rank in the service,i his Christian name, and his surname to be presented in due course to the police. As he went downstairs the waiter spelled out as follows: “Pavel Ivanovitch Tchitchikov, collegiate councillorj and landowner, travelling on his private business.” While the waiter was still engaged in spelling this out, Pavel Ivanovitch Tchitchikov went off to look at the town, with which he was, it appears, satisfied, for he considered that it was in no way inferior to other provincial towns: the yellow paint on the brick houses was extremely glaring, while the wood houses were a modest dark grey. The houses were of one storey, of two storeys, and of one and a half storeys with the everlasting mezzanine which provincial architects think so beautiful. In some parts these houses looked lost in the midst of a street as wide as a field and unending wooden fences; in other places they were all crowded together, and here more life and movement were noticeable. There were shop signboards with bread-rings or boots on them, almost effaced by the rain, with here and there a picture of blue trousers and the name of some tailor; in one place was a shop with caps, and the inscription: “Vassily Fyodorov, foreigner”; in another place there was depicted a billiard table with two players in dress coats such as are worn in our theatres by the visitors who come on to the stage in the last act. The players were represented taking aim with the cue, their arms a little drawn back and their legs crooked as though they had just made an entrechatk in the air. Under all this was inscribed: “And here is the establishment.” Here and there, tables covered with nuts, soap, and cakes that looked like soap, stood simply in the street; and here and there was an eating-house with a fat fish and a fork stuck in it on the signboard. More often than anything he observed, somewhat darkened by age, the two-headed imperial eaglel which is nowadays replaced by the laconic inscription: “Beer and spirits.” The pavement was everywhere in a bad state. He glanced too into the town park which consisted of skimpy and drooping trees, supported by props put in triangles and very handsomely painted green. Though these trees were no higher than a reed, yet in describing some illumina tions the newspapers had said of them that: “Our town has, thanks to the care of the municipal authorities, been adorned with a park of spreading shady trees that provide welcome coolness on a sultry day,” and that “it was extremely touching to observe how the hearts of the townspeople were quivering with tears in recognition of what they owed to his worship the Mayor.” After minutely questioning a policeman as to the nearest way to the cathedral, to the government offices and to the governor‘s, he went to have a look at the river which flowed through the middle of the town; on the way he tore off a poster affixed to a pole in order to read it carefully on returning home, stared at a lady of prepossessing exterior who was walking along the wooden side-walk, followed by a boy in military livery with a parcel in his hand, and after once more scrutinising it all as though to remember precisely the position of everything, he went home and straight up to his hotel room, slightly assisted up the staircase by the waiter. After drinking tea he sat down before his table, ordered a candle, took the poster out of his pocket, held it to the light, and began to read it, slightly screwing up his right eye. There was little of interest in the poster however: a play of Kotzebue’s m was being performed with Poplyovin in the part of Rolla and Mademoiselle Zyablov in that of Cora, and the other performers were even less noteworthy; he read through all their names, however, and even went on to the price of the orchestra stalls, and learned that the poster had been printed at the printing press of the government department of the province. Then he turned it over to find out if there was anything of interest on the other side, but, finding nothing, rubbed his eyes, folded it up neatly and put it in his chest, in which he had the habit of stowing away everything that turned up. The day was I believe concluded by a plateful of cold veal, a pint of sour cabbage soup, and a sound sleep, with every tap turned on, as the expression is in some parts of the spacious Russian empire.","While the attendants had been thus setting things straight the gentleman had repaired to the common parlour. The appearance of common parlours of the kind is known to every one who travels. Always they have varnished walls which, grown black in their upper portions with tobacco smoke, are, in their lower, grown shiny with the friction of customers’ backs—more especially with that of the backs of such local tradesmen as, on market-days, make it their regular practice to resort to the local hostelry for a glass of tea. Also, parlours of this kind invariably contain smutty ceilings, an equally smutty chandelier, a number of pendent shades which jump and rattle whenever the waiter scurries across the shabby oilcloth with a trayful of glasses (the glasses looking like a flock of birds roosting by the seashore), and a selection of oil paintings. In short, there are certain objects which one sees in every inn. In the present case the only outstanding feature of the room was the fact that in one of the paintings a nymph was portrayed as possessing breasts of a size such as the reader can never in his life have beheld. A similar caricaturing of nature is to be noted in the historical pictures (of unknown origin, period, and creation) which reach us—sometimes through the instrumentality of Russian magnates who profess to be connoisseurs of art—from Italy; owing to the said magnates having made such purchases solely on the advice of the couriers who have escorted them. To resume, however—our traveller removed his cap, and divested his neck of a parti-coloured woollen scarf of the kind which a wife makes for her husband with her own hands, while accompanying the gift with interminable injunctions as to how best such a garment ought to be folded. True, bachelors also wear similar gauds, but, in their case, God alone knows who may have manufactured the articles! For my part, I cannot endure them. Having unfolded the scarf, the gentleman ordered dinner, and whilst the various dishes were being got ready—cabbage soup, a pie several weeks old, a dish of marrow and peas, a dish of sausages and cabbage, a roast fowl, some salted cucumber, and the sweet tart which stands perpetually ready for use in such establishments; whilst, I say, these things were either being warmed up or brought in cold, the gentleman induced the waiter to retail certain fragments of tittle-tattle concerning the late landlord of the hostelry, the amount of income which the hostelry produced, and the character of its present proprietor. To the last-mentioned inquiry the waiter returned the answer invariably given in such cases—namely, “My master is a terribly hard man, sir.” Curious that in enlightened Russia so many people cannot even take a meal at an inn without chattering to the attendant and making free with him! Nevertheless not ALL the questions which the gentleman asked were aimless ones, for he inquired who was Governor of the town, who President of the Local Council, and who Public Prosecutor. In short, he omitted no single official of note, while asking also (though with an air of detachment) the most exact particulars concerning the landowners of the neighbourhood. Which of them, he inquired, possessed serfs, and how many of them? How far from the town did those landowners reside? What was the character of each landowner, and was he in the habit of paying frequent visits to the town? The gentleman also made searching inquiries concerning the hygienic condition of the countryside. Was there, he asked, much sickness about—whether sporadic fever, fatal forms of ague, smallpox, or what not? Yet, though his solicitude concerning these matters showed more than ordinary curiosity, his bearing retained its gravity unimpaired, and from time to time he blew his nose with portentous fervour. Indeed, the manner in which he accomplished this latter feat was marvellous in the extreme, for, though that member emitted sounds equal to those of a trumpet in intensity, he could yet, with his accompanying air of guileless dignity, evoke the waiter’s undivided respect—so much so that, whenever the sounds of the nose reached that menial’s ears, he would shake back his locks, straighten himself into a posture of marked solicitude, and inquire afresh, with head slightly inclined, whether the gentleman happened to require anything further. After dinner the guest consumed a cup of coffee, and then, seating himself upon the sofa, with, behind him, one of those wool-covered cushions which, in Russian taverns, resemble nothing so much as a cobblestone or a brick, fell to snoring; whereafter, returning with a start to consciousness, he ordered himself to be conducted to his room, flung himself at full length upon the bed, and once more slept soundly for a couple of hours. Aroused, eventually, by the waiter, he, at the latter’s request, inscribed a fragment of paper with his name, his surname, and his rank (for communication, in accordance with the law, to the police): and on that paper the waiter, leaning forward from the corridor, read, syllable by syllable: “Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, Collegiate Councillor—Landowner —Travelling on Private Affairs.” The waiter had just time to accomplish this feat before Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov set forth to inspect the town. Apparently the place succeeded in satisfying him, and, to tell the truth, it was at least up to the usual standard of our provincial capitals. Where the staring yellow of stone edifices did not greet his eye he found himself confronted with the more modest grey of wooden ones; which, consisting, for the most part, of one or two storeys (added to the range of attics which provincial architects love so well), looked almost lost amid the expanses of street and intervening medleys of broken or half-finished partition-walls. At other points evidence of more life and movement was to be seen, and here the houses stood crowded together and displayed dilapidated, rain-blurred signboards whereon boots or cakes or pairs of blue breeches inscribed “Arshavski, Tailor,” and so forth, were depicted. Over a shop containing hats and caps was written “Vassili Thedorov, Foreigner”; while, at another spot, a signboard portrayed a billiard table and two players—the latter clad in frockcoats of the kind usually affected by actors whose part it is to enter the stage during the closing act of a piece, even though, with arms sharply crooked and legs slightly bent, the said billiard players were taking the most careful aim, but succeeding only in making abortive strokes in the air. Each emporium of the sort had written over it: “This is the best establishment of its kind in the town.” Also, al fresco in the streets there stood tables heaped with nuts, soap, and gingerbread (the latter but little distinguishable from the soap), and at an eating-house there was displayed the sign of a plump fish transfixed with a gaff. But the sign most frequently to be discerned was the insignia of the State, the double-headed eagle (now replaced, in this connection, with the laconic inscription “Dramshop”). As for the paving of the town, it was uniformly bad. The gentleman peered also into the municipal gardens, which contained only a few sorry trees that were poorly selected, requiring to be propped with oil-painted, triangular green supports, and able to boast of a height no greater than that of an ordinary walking-stick. Yet recently the local paper had said (apropos of a gala) that, “Thanks to the efforts of our Civil Governor, the town has become enriched with a pleasaunce full of umbrageous, spaciously-branching trees. Even on the most sultry day they afford agreeable shade, and indeed gratifying was it to see the hearts of our citizens panting with an impulse of gratitude as their eyes shed tears in recognition of all that their Governor has done for them!” Next, after inquiring of a gendarme as to the best ways and means of finding the local council, the local law-courts, and the local Governor, should he (Chichikov) have need of them, the gentleman went on to inspect the river which ran through the town. En route he tore off a notice affixed to a post, in order that he might the more conveniently read it after his return to the inn. Also, he bestowed upon a lady of pleasant exterior who, escorted by a footman laden with a bundle, happened to be passing along a wooden sidewalk a prolonged stare. Lastly, he threw around him a comprehensive glance (as though to fix in his mind the general topography of the place) and betook himself home. There, gently aided by the waiter, he ascended the stairs to his bedroom, drank a glass of tea, and, seating himself at the table, called for a candle; which having been brought him, he produced from his pocket the notice, held it close to the flame, and conned its tenour—slightly contracting his right eye as he did so. Yet there was little in the notice to call for remark. All that it said was that shortly one of Kotzebue’s 6 plays would be given, and that one of the parts in the play was to be taken by a certain Monsieur Poplevin, and another by a certain Mademoiselle Ziablova, while the remaining parts were to be filled by a number of less important personages. Nevertheless the gentleman perused the notice with careful attention, and even jotted down the prices to be asked for seats for the performance. Also, he remarked that the bill had been printed in the press of the Provincial Government. Next, he turned over the paper, in order to see if anything further was to be read on the reverse side; but, finding nothing there, he refolded the document, placed it in the box which served him as a receptacle for odds and ends, and brought the day to a close with a portion of cold veal, a bottle of pickles, and a sound sleep.","While the servants were settling and pottering, the gentleman went to the common room. What these common rooms are, every traveler knows very well: the same walls painted with oil paint, darkened above by pipe smoke, and shiny below from the backs of various travelers, and still more of indigenous merchants, for merchants came here on market days in sixes and sevens to drink their well-known two cups of tea; the same besooted ceiling; the same sooty chandelier with its multitude of glass pendants that danced and jingled each time the floorboy ran across the worn oilcloth deftly balancing a tray on which sat numerous teacups, like birds on the seashore; the same oil paintings all over the wall—in short, the same as everywhere; with the only difference that one painting portrayed a nymph with such enormous breasts as the reader has probably never seen. Such sports of nature occur, however, in various historical paintings, brought to our Russia no one knows at what time, from where, or by whom, on occasion even by our grand dignitaries, lovers of art, who bought them up in Italy on the advice of the couriers that drove them around. The gentleman took off his peaked cap and unwound from his neck a rainbow-hued woolen scarf, such as married men are provided with by their wives, with their own hands, who furnish them with suitable instructions on how to wrap oneself up, while for bachelors—I cannot say for certain who makes them, God alone knows, I myself have never worn such scarves. Having unwound the scarf, the gentleman ordered dinner to be served. While he was being served various dishes usual in taverns, such as: cabbage soup with puff pastry, preserved over many weeks purposely for travelers, brains and peas, sausages and cabbage, roast poulard, pickles, and eternal sweet puff pastries, always ready to please; while all this was being served, warmed up or simply cold, he made the servant, that is, the floorboy, tell him all sorts of rubbish—about who had kept the tavern before and who kept it now, and did it bring in much income, and was their master a great scoundrel, to which the floorboy gave the customary answer: “Oh, he is, sir. A great crook.” As in enlightened Europe, so in enlightened Russia there are now quite a lot of respectable people who cannot have a meal in a tavern without talking with the servant and sometimes even making an amusing joke at his expense. However, the visitor’s questions were not all idle; he inquired with extreme precision as to who was the governor of the town, who was the head magistrate, who was the prosecutor—in short, he did not skip a single important official; but with still greater precision, even almost concern, he inquired about all the important landowners: how many peasant souls each one had, how far from town he lived, even what his character was and how often he came to town; he inquired attentively into the condition of the area: whether there were any diseases in their province—epidemics of fever, some deadly agues, smallpox, and the like, and all this so thoroughly and with such precision that it showed more than mere curiosity alone. The gentleman’s manners had something solid about them, and he blew his nose with an exceeding loudness. It is not known how he did it, only his nose sounded like a trumpet. This apparently quite innocent virtue, however, gained him great esteem on the part of the tavern servant, who, each time he heard this sound, tossed his hair, drew himself up more respectfully, and, bowing his head from on high, asked: was anything required? After dinner the gentleman took himself a cup of coffee and sat on the sofa, propping his back against a pillow, which in Russian taverns are stuffed not with springy wool, but instead with something extremely like bricks and cobbles. Here he started yawning and asked to be taken to his room, where he lay down and slept for two hours. Having rested, he wrote on a scrap of paper, at the request of the tavern servant, his rank and full name, to be conveyed to the proper quarters, the police. On the paper, mouthing each syllable as he went down the stairs, the floorboy read the following: “Collegiate Councillor Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, landowner, on private business.” While the floorboy was still working through the syllables of the note, Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov himself set out to have a look at the town, with which, it seems, he was satisfied, for he found that the town yielded in nothing to other provincial towns: striking to the eye was the yellow paint on the stone houses, modestly dark was the gray of the wooden ones. The houses were of one, two, and one and a half stories, with those eternal mezzanines so beautiful in the opinion of provincial architects. In some places the houses seemed lost amid the street, wide as a field, and the never-ending wooden fences; in others they clustered together, and here one could note more animation and human commotion. One came across signboards all but washed out by rain, with pretzels and boots, or, in one place, with blue trousers pictured on them and the signature of some Warsaw tailor; then a shop with peaked caps, flat caps, and inscribed: VASSILY FYODOROV, FOREIGNER; in another place a picture of a billiard table with two players in tailcoats of the kind worn in our theater by guests who come on stage in the last act. The players were depicted aiming their cues, their arms somewhat twisted back and their legs askew, having just performed an entrechat in the air. Under all this was written: AND THIS IS THE ESTABLISHMENT. In some places there were tables simply standing in the street, with nuts, soap, and gingerbreads resembling soap; then an eatery with a picture of a fat fish with a fork stuck into it. Most frequently one noted weathered, two-headed state eagles, which have since been replaced by the laconic inscription: PUBLIC HOUSE. The pavement everywhere was of a poorish sort. He also peeked into the town garden, which consisted of skinny trees, badly rooted, propped by supports formed in triangles, very beautifully painted with green oil paint. However, though these little trees were no taller than reeds, it was said of them in the newspapers, as they described some festive decorations, that “our town has been beautified, thanks to the solicitude of the civic ruler, by a garden consisting of shady, wide-branching trees that provide coolness on hot days,” and that “it was very moving to see the hearts of the citizens flutter in an abundance of gratitude and pour forth streams of tears as a token of thankfulness to mister governor.” Having inquired in detail of a sentry as to the shortest way, in case of need, to the cathedral, the municipal offices, the governor’s, he set out to view the river that flowed through the middle of the town, in passing tore off a playbill attached to a post, so as to read it properly when he got home, looked intently at a lady of comely appearance who was walking down the wooden sidewalk, followed by a boy in military livery with a bundle in his hand, and, once more casting his eyes around at it all, as if with the purpose of memorizing well the disposition of the place, went home straight to his room, supported somewhat on the stairs by the tavern servant. After taking tea, he sat down before the table, asked for a candle, took the playbill from his pocket, brought it near the candle, and began to read, squinting his right eye slightly. However, there was little remarkable in the playbill: Mr. Kotzebue’s drama2 was showing, with Rolla played by Mr. Poplyovin, Cora by Miss Zyablova, the rest of the cast being even less remarkable; but he read them all anyway, even got as far as the price for the stalls, and learned that the playbill had been printed on the provincial government press; then he turned it over to the other side: to see if there was anything there, but, finding nothing, he rubbed his eyes, folded it neatly, and put it into his little chest, where he was in the habit of stowing away whatever came along. The day, it seems, was concluded with a helping of cold veal, a bottle of fizzy kvass, and a sound sleep with all pumps pumping, as the saying goes in some parts of the vast Russian state.","While the servants were arranging things and fussing about, the gentleman went down into the common room. What these common rooms are like every transient knows well: there are always the same oil-painted walls, darkened at the top from chimney smoke and glossy below from the backs of sundry transients, but still more from those of the indigenous traders, inasmuch as the merchants came here on market days in their sixes and their sevens to imbibe their well-known glass or two of tea; the same sooty ceiling; the same chandelier, dingy from smoke, with a multitude of pendent bits of glass that leapt and bounded and tinkled every time a waiter dashed across the worn-out oilcloth mattings, deftly swinging a tray on which was perched as great a host of teacups as you might find of birds on a shore; the same pictures, covering an entire wall and done in oils—in a word, everything the same as you would find everywhere; the sole difference was that one picture depicted a nymph with such enormous breasts as the reader, in all probability, has never beheld. Such a sport of nature, however, occurs in various historical pictures, although no one knows at what period, or whence, or by whom they were imported among us in Russia—now and then, perhaps, by our grandees, those lovers of the arts, who must have bought them up in Italy upon the advice of the couriers who had driven them about. The gentleman threw off his cap and unwound from around his neck a woolen, tricornered neckerchief of all the hues of the rainbow, of the sort that is folded for married men by their wives, with their own fair hands, to the accompaniment of prudent counsels on how they ought to muffle themselves; as for who performs that office for bachelors I cannot say with any certainty—God knows what shifts they are put to!—I never having worn such neckerchiefs. Having unwound it, the gentleman ordered his dinner. While the various dishes usual to taverns were being served up to him, such as cabbage soup with small dumplings of puff paste (the latter purposely preserved for weeks at a stretch for the particular benefit of transients), brains with peas, sausages and sauerkraut, a roast fowl, dill pickles, and the eternal sweet pastry of layered dough, which is always at your service—while all this was being served to him, either warmed over or simply cold, he made the tavern waiter retail to him all sorts of small talk concerning such things as who had kept this tavern before and who was keeping it now, and whether it yielded much income, and whether the host were a great scoundrel, to which the waiter made the usual answer: “Oh, he’s a great hand at a swindle, sir!” Even as in enlightened Europe, so in enlightened Russia as well there are at present many worthy persons who can never dine in a tavern without having a chat with the waiter and at times even having a bit of fun at his expense. However, not all the questions this transient gentleman put were idle ones; he inquired, with the utmost particularity, about the officials in the town: who was the Governor of the province, who was the Chairman of the Administrative Offices, who was the Public Prosecutor—in short, he did not pass over a single bureaucrat of any importance; but with still greater particularity, if not downright concern, did he make inquiries about all the prominent landowners: how many souls of serfs each one owned, how far out of town he lived, even what his character was like and how often he drove into town; he inquired closely about the state of the region—whether certain diseases weren’t prevalent in that province, such as epidemic fevers, deadly agues of one sort or another, smallpox and things of that sort, and all this he asked in such a way and with such particularity as to indicate that his interest was more than mere curiosity. There was something substantial about the ways of this gentleman, and whenever he blew his nose he did so exceedingly loudly. No one knows just how he did it, but his nose resounded like a trumpet. This point of merit, apparently a perfectly innocent one, won, nevertheless, a great deal of respect for him on the part of the tavern server, so that every time he heard this sound he would toss back his hair, straighten up with greater deference, and, inclining his head from the heights, ask was the gentleman wishin’ somethin’. After dinner the gentleman partook of a cup of coffee and seated himself on a divan, resting his back on one of the cushions (which in Russian taverns are stuffed with broken bricks and cobblestones instead of resilient wool). At this point he took to yawning and asked to be shown up to his room, where, lying down for just forty winks, he fell asleep for a couple of hours. Having had his siesta, he wrote on a slip of paper, at the request of the tavern waiter, his rank as well as his first name and his last, for reference to the proper quarters: the police department. As the server went down the stairs, he spelled out the following on the slip of paper: “Collegiate Councilor Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, landowner, traveling on private affairs.”1 While the server was still spelling out the note, Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov himself set out to look the town over and, it would seem, was quite satisfied with it, since he found that it in no way yielded to other provincial towns—the paint on the stone houses was the usual yellow and just as hard on the eyes, while the paint on the wooden houses showed as a modestly dark gray, quite unexceptional. The houses were of one story, of two stories, and of a story and a half, with the everlasting mezzanine which, in the opinion of the provincial architects, is ever so handsome. In some places these houses seemed lost in the midst of a street as wide as a field and among never-ending wooden fences; in others they got into a huddle, and in such places one could note a greater movement of people and greater animation. One came across signs that were all but washed off by the rains, showing pretzels and boots; occasionally these signs depicted blue breeches and the signature of some tailor or other who hailed from ’Arsaw; here was a store with caps and forage caps and the inscription: “Vasilii Fedorov—from Abroad”; over there, a depiction of a billiard table with two players togged out in the sort of frock coats worn in our theaters by those guests who come on the stage in the last act. The billiard players were portrayed taking aim with their cues, their arms twisted backward somewhat, and with bowlegs, for all the world as though they had just cut a caper in the air. Under this was inscribed: “This Way to the Establishment.” Here and there, right out on the street, stood stalls with nuts, soap, and cookies that looked like soap; occasionally one came on a cookshop, with a depiction of a rotund fish with a fork stuck in it. But most frequently of all one noted the time-darkened two-headed imperial eagles, which by now have been replaced by the laconic inscription: “Liquors at Retail.” And the pavement was rather poor everywhere. Chichikov also looked in at the town park, consisting of the puniest of trees, which had taken but poorly to the soil, propped at the bottom with boards placed in triangles and very handsomely painted in a glossy green. Although these trees were no higher than reeds, the newspapers, in describing certain gala illuminations, had said of them that, “Our city has been graced, thanks to the solicitude of the Municipal Director, by a park of shady trees whose spreading boughs provide coolness on a sultry day,” and that, during the ceremonies, “it was most touching to observe how the hearts of the citizens throbbed in an excess of gratitude, while torrents of tears streamed forth as a mark of appreciation for His Honor the Mayor.” Having minutely questioned a policeman on post in a sentry box as to what was the nearest way of going, if need be, to the cathedral, to the government offices, to the Governors, Chichikov set out for a look at the river which flowed through the middle of the town; on his way thither he tore off a poster tacked up on a post, so that, upon his arrival at home, he might give it a thorough reading; eyed closely a lady who was not at all hard to look at as she passed over the wooden sidewalk, followed by a boy in livery of a military cut with a small bundle in his hand; and after once more casting an eye over everything, as though to memorize well the lay of the land, he set out straight for home and his room, being delicately helped up the stairs by the tavern waiter. Having regaled himself with tea, he seated himself at a table, called for a candle to be brought to him, took out of his pocket the poster, and, holding it close to the candle, fell to reading, puckering his right eye just a trifle. However, there wasn’t a great deal of anything remarkable in the broadside: a drama by Kotzebue was being presented,2 Rolla to be played by one Poplevin, Cora by Mile Ziablova, while the other personae were even less outstanding; however, he read the names of the whole cast through, getting down even to the price for parterre seats, and also learned that the poster had been printed at the printing press of the Administration of that province; next he turned the sheet over to find out if there might not be something on the other side as well, but finding nothing, he rubbed his eyes, folded the sheet neatly, and put it away in his traveling chest, wherein it was his wont to store everything that came to his hand. The day was (unless I am mistaken) brought to a close by a portion of cold veal, a bottle of sparkling kvas, and sound slumber, with the air pump going full blast, to use an expression current in certain localities of our widespread Russian realm.3"

Ведь вот что вышло!","- And here is another Don Quixote of enlightenment: he started schools! Well, what, for example, is more useful to a person than knowledge of literacy? But how did you order it? After all, men from his village come to me. “What is this, they say, father, is this? our sons are completely out of hand, they don’t want to help in the work, everyone wants to be a clerk, but you only need a clerk.” After all, that's what happened!","“And here another Don Quixote of enlightenment has founded a school. Well, what can be more useful for a man than to know how to read or write? But this is how he manages things. The peasants from his village come to me, ‘What’s the meaning of this, sir?’ they say, ‘our sons have got completely out of hand, they won’t help us on the land, they all want to be clerks, but you know there is only one clerk wanted.’ So that’s what it comes to.”","Kostanzhoglo spat and added: “Yet when he returns from abroad he is a hundred times more ignorant than when he went.” “Ah, Constantine,” put in his wife anxiously, “you know how bad for you it is to talk like this.” “Yes, but how am I to help losing my temper? The thing touches me too closely, it vexes me too deeply to think that the Russian character should be degenerating.","“And here’s another Don Quixote of enlightenment: he’s set up schools! Now, what, for instance, is more useful to a man than literacy? And how did he handle it? Muzhiks from his estate come to me. ‘ What’s going on, my dear?’ they say. ‘Our sons have got completely out of hand, don’t want to help us work, they all want to become scriveners, but there’s need for only one scrivener.’ That’s what came of it!”",
"Но не то тяжело, что будут недовольны героем, тяжело то, что живет в душе неотразимая уверенность, что тем же самым героем, тем же самым Чичиковым были бы довольны читатели. Не загляни автор поглубже ему в душу, не шевельни на дне ее того, что ускользает и прячется от света, не обнаружь сокровеннейших мыслей, которых никому другому не вверяет человек, а покажи его таким, каким он показался всему городу, Манилову и другим людям, и все были бы радешеньки и приняли бы его за интересного человека. Нет нужды, что ни лицо, ни весь образ его не метался бы как живой пред глазами; зато по окончании чтения душа не встревожена ничем, и можно обратиться вновь к карточному столу, тешащему всю Россию. Да, мои добрые читатели, вам бы не хотелось видеть обнаруженную человеческую бедность. Зачем, говорите вы, к чему это? Разве мы не знаем сами, что есть много презренного и глупого в жизни? И без того случается нам часто видеть то, что вовсе не утешительно. Лучше же представляйте нам прекрасное, увлекательное. Пусть лучше позабудемся мы! «Зачем ты, брат, говоришь мне, что дела в хозяйстве идут скверно? — говорит помещик приказчику. — Я, брат, это знаю без тебя, да у тебя речей разве нет других, что ли? Ты дай мне позабыть это, не знать этого, я тогда счастлив». И вот те деньги, которые бы поправили сколько-нибудь дело, идут на разные средства для приведения себя в забвенье. Спит ум, может быть обретший бы внезапный родник великих средств; а там имение бух с аукциона, и пошел помещик забываться по миру с душою, от крайности готовою на низости, которых бы сам ужаснулся прежде.","But it’s not so hard that they will be dissatisfied with the hero, it’s hard that there lives in the soul an irresistible confidence that the readers would be satisfied with the same hero, the same Chichikov. Do not look deeper into his soul, do not stir at the bottom of it what escapes and hides from the light, do not reveal the innermost thoughts that a person does not entrust to anyone else, but show him as he seemed to the whole city, Manilov and other people, and everyone would be welcome and take him for an interesting person. There is no need that neither the face nor the whole image of him would rush about as if alive before his eyes; on the other hand, at the end of the reading, the soul is not disturbed by anything, and one can turn again to the card table that amuses all of Russia. Yes, my good readers, you would hate to see human poverty exposed. Why, you say, what is it for? Don't we ourselves know that there are many despicable and stupid things in life? And without that, it often happens to us to see something that is not at all comforting. Better present to us the beautiful, the fascinating. Let us better forget! “Why are you telling me, brother, that things are going badly on the farm? says the landowner to the clerk. “I, brother, know this without you, but don’t you have other speeches, or what?” You let me forget it, not know it, then I'm happy. And so the money that would somehow improve the matter is spent on various means to bring oneself into oblivion. The mind sleeps, perhaps having found a sudden spring of great means; and there the estate was bukh from an auction, and the landowner went to forget himself in the world with a soul, from extremes ready for baseness, which he himself would have been horrified before.","But what weighs upon me is not that my readers will be displeased with my hero. What weighs upon me is the conviction which nothing can shake in my soul, that my readers would have been delighted with the same hero, this same Tchitchikov, if the author had not looked too deeply into his soul, had not stirred up in its depths what slips away and hides from the light, had not displayed the most secret thoughts which a man does not trust to any other, but had shown him such as he appeared to all the town, to Manilov and others; then every one would have been delighted with him, and would have welcomed him as an interesting man. It would not have mattered that neither his face nor his whole figure would have moved as though living before their eyes; on the other hand, when they had finished the book, their souls would have been untroubled and they could go back to the card table, which is the solace of all Russia. Yes, my gentle readers, you would rather not see the poverty of human nature exposed. “What for?” you say; “what is the use of it? Do you suppose we don’t know that there is a great deal that is stupid and contemptible in life? We often have to see what is by no means cheering, apart from you. You had better show us what is noble and attractive. Better let us forget.” “Why do you tell me that my estate is in a bad way, my lad?” says the landowner to his steward, “I know that, my dear fellow, without your telling me; have you nothing better than that to say? Let me forget it; let me not know it, then I shall be happy.” And so the money which might to some extent have saved the situation is wasted on all sorts of ways of inducing forgetfulness. The mind from which, perhaps, great resources might have sprung sleeps; and the estate is knocked down at auction and the owner is cast adrift to forget his troubles with his soul ready in his extremity for base deeds at which he would once have been horrified.","Yet that folk should be dissatisfied with my hero matters nothing. What matters is the fact that, under different circumstances, their approval could have been taken as a foregone conclusion. That is to say, had not the author pried over-deeply into Chichikov’s soul, nor stirred up in its depths what shunned and lay hidden from the light, nor disclosed those of his hero’s thoughts which that hero would have not have disclosed even to his most intimate friend; had the author, indeed, exhibited Chichikov just as he exhibited himself to the townsmen of N. and Manilov and the rest; well, then we may rest assured that every reader would have been delighted with him, and have voted him a most interesting person. For it is not nearly so necessary that Chichikov should figure before the reader as though his form and person were actually present to the eye as that, on concluding a perusal of this work, the reader should be able to return, unharrowed in soul, to that cult of the card-table which is the solace and delight of all good Russians. Yes, readers of this book, none of you really care to see humanity revealed in its nakedness. “Why should we do so?” you say. “What would be the use of it? Do we not know for ourselves that human life contains much that is gross and contemptible? Do we not with our own eyes have to look upon much that is anything but comforting? Far better would it be if you would put before us what is comely and attractive, so that we might forget ourselves a little.” In the same fashion does a landowner say to his bailiff: “Why do you come and tell me that the affairs of my estate are in a bad way? I know that without YOUR help. Have you nothing else to tell me? Kindly allow me to forget the fact, or else to remain in ignorance of it, and I shall be much obliged to you.” Whereafter the said landowner probably proceeds to spend on his diversion the money which ought to have gone towards the rehabilitation of his affairs.","But the hard thing is not that readers will be displeased with my hero, what is hard is that there lives in my soul an irrefutable certainty that they might have been pleased with this same hero, this same Chichikov. If the author had not looked deeply into his soul, had not stirred up from its bottom that which flees and hides from the light, had not revealed his secret thoughts which no man entrusts to another, but had shown him such as he appeared to the whole town, to Manilov and the others, everyone would have been happy as can be and would have taken him for an interesting man. Never mind that neither his face nor his whole image would have hovered as if alive before their eyes; instead, once the reading was over, the soul would not be troubled by anything, and one could turn back to the card table, the solace of all Russia. Yes, my good readers, you would prefer not to see human poverty revealed. Why, you ask, what for? Do we not know ourselves that there is much in life that is contemptible and stupid? Even without that, one often chances to see things which are by no means comforting. Better present us with something beautiful, captivating. Better let us become oblivious! “Why, brother, are you telling me that things aren’t going well with the management of the estate?” says the landowner to his steward. “I know that without you, brother, haven’t you got something else to talk about? You ought to let me forget it, not know it, then I’ll be happy.” And so the money that would have helped somehow to straighten things out is spent on the means for making oneself oblivious. The mind sleeps, the mind that might find some unexpected fount of great means; and then, bang! the estate gets auctioned, and the landowner takes his oblivion and goes begging, his soul ready in its extremity for such baseness as once would have horrified him.","But it is not the fact that my readers will be dissatisfied with my hero which is heavy to bear; what is so heavy to bear is that there dwells within my soul an irresistible conviction that the readers might have been satisfied with that self-same hero, with that self-same Chichikov. Had the author not peered quite so deeply into his soul, had he not stirred at the bottom thereof that which glides away and hides from the light, had he not revealed his most secret thoughts, such as no man will confide to another, but shown him as he appeared to the whole town, to Manilov and all the other people, why, all my readers would have been downright pleased and would have accepted him as an interesting fellow. There was no need to make either his face or his whole image spring up so lifelike before the readers’ eyes; had the author restrained himself, the readers’ souls would not be troubled by anything after reading the book through, and they would be able to turn anew to the card table, that solace of all Russia, in all equanimity. Yes, my good readers, you would rather not see mankind’s poverty exposed. “Why all this?” you say. “What does it all lead to? For don’t we ourselves know that there is a great deal of the contemptible and stupid in life? Even as it is, it often befalls us to see that which isn’t at all comforting. It would be better, then, to represent for us that which is splendidly beautiful, enticing. Better let us forget ourselves for a while!” “Brother,” says the landowner to his steward, “why do you tell me that things are going abominably with my estate? Brother, I know that without you; why, haven’t you got anything else to talk about, now? You just give me a chance to forget all this, not to be aware of it, then I’ll be happy.” And so the money that might have mended matters to some extent goes for various means of inducing self-forgetfulness. The mind that perhaps might have struck a sudden wellspring of great resources slumbers, and there goes the estate bang! under the hammer, and the landowner is sent forth into the world as a beggar to seek forgetfulness, with a soul that, out of extreme need, is ready to commit base deeds at which he himself would have been horrified once upon a time."

"— Вот он вас проведет в присутствие! — сказал Иван Антонович, кивнув головою, и один из священнодействующих, тут же находившихся, приносивший с таким усердием жертвы Фемиде, что оба рукава лопнули на локтях и давно лезла оттуда подкладка, за что и получил в свое время коллежского регистратора, прислужился нашим приятелям, как некогда Виргилий прислужился Данту, и провел их в комнату присутствия, где стояли одни только широкие кресла и в них перед столом, за зерцалом и двумя толстыми книгами, сидел один, как солнце, председатель. В этом месте новый Вергилий почувствовал такое благоговение, что никак не осмелился занести туда ногу и поворотил назад, показав свою спину, вытертую, как рогожка, с прилипнувшим где-то куриным пером. Вошедши в залу присутствия, они увидели, что председатель был не один, подле него сидел Собакевич, совершенно заслоненный зерцалом. Приход гостей произвел восклицание, правительственные кресла были отодвинуты с шумом. Собакевич тоже привстал со стула и стал виден со всех сторон с длинными своими рукавами. Председатель принял Чичикова в объятия, и комната присутствия огласилась поцелуями; спросили друг друга о здоровье; оказалось, что у обоих побаливает поясница, что тут же было отнесено к сидячей жизни. Председатель, казалось, уже был уведомлен Собакевичем о покупке, потому что принялся поздравлять, что сначала несколько смешало нашего героя, особливо когда он увидел, что и Собакевич и Манилов, оба продавцы, с которыми дело было улажено келейно, теперь стояли вместе лицом друг к другу. Однако же он поблагодарил председателя и, обратившись тут же к Собакевичу, спросил:","- Here he will lead you into the presence! - said Ivan Antonovich, nodding his head, and one of the clergymen, who were right there, made sacrifices to Themis with such zeal that both sleeves burst at the elbows and the lining had long climbed from there, for which he received a collegiate registrar in his time, served our friends, how once Virgil served Dante, and led them into the presence room, where there were only wide chairs and in them, in front of the table, behind a mirror and two thick books, sat alone, like the sun, the chairman. In this place, the new Virgil felt such reverence that he did not dare to put his foot there and turned back, showing his back, worn out like a matting, with a chicken feather stuck somewhere. Entering the hall of presence, they saw that the chairman was not alone; Sobakevich was sitting next to him, completely eclipsed by the mirror. The arrival of the guests made an exclamation, government chairs were pushed back noisily. Sobakevich also got up from his chair and became visible from all sides with his long sleeves. The chairman took Chichikov into his arms, and the room of presence resounded with kisses; asked each other about health; it turned out that both had lower back pain, which was immediately attributed to a sedentary life. The chairman, it seemed, had already been notified by Sobakevich of the purchase, because he began to congratulate, which at first somewhat confused our hero, especially when he saw that both Sobakevich and Manilov, both sellers with whom the matter had been settled privately, were now standing together facing each other. friend. However, he thanked the chairman and, turning immediately to Sobakevich, asked:","“Here, he’ll show you to the office,” said Ivan Antonovitch, with a nod of his head, and one of the votaries standing near—he had sacrificed so zealously to Themis that his sleeves were in holes at the elbows and the lining was sticking out, for which sacrifices he had been rewarded with the grade of collegiate registrar—performed for our friends the office that Virgil once performed for Dante,ca and brought them to an apartment in which there was one roomy armchair, and, in it, solitary as the sun, the president sat at a table behind a Double Eagle and two thick books. In this place the new Virgil was so overcome by awe that he did not venture to set foot within its portals, but turned round, displaying his back worn as threadbare as a bit of matting, and with a hen’s feather sticking on it. On entering the office, they saw that the president was not alone. With him was sitting Sobakevitch, completely screened by the Double Eagle. The entrance of the guests was greeted with an exclamation, the presidential chair was noisily pushed back. Sobakevitch, too, got up from his chair, and became visible from all sides, with his long sleeves. The president clasped Tchitchikov in his arms, and the room resounded with kisses; they inquired after each other’s health; it appeared that both were suffering from pains in the back, which were at once set down to a sedentary life. The president seemed to have been already informed of the purchase by Sobakevitch, for he began congratulat ing our hero, which at first rather embarrassed the latter, especially when he saw Sobakevitch and Manilov, two vendors, with each of whom the business had been transacted in private, now standing face to face. He thanked the president, however, and addressing Sobakevitch, asked: “","“A clerk,” he added, “will now conduct you to Ivan Grigorievitch’s room.” Upon that one of the toilers in the service of Themis—a zealot who had offered her such heartfelt sacrifice that his coat had burst at the elbows and lacked a lining—escorted our friends (even as Virgil had once escorted Dante) to the apartment of the Presence. In this sanctum were some massive armchairs, a table laden with two or three fat books, and a large looking-glass. Lastly, in (apparently) sunlike isolation, there was seated at the table the President. On arriving at the door of the apartment, our modern Virgil seemed to have become so overwhelmed with awe that, without daring even to intrude a foot, he turned back, and, in so doing, once more exhibited a back as shiny as a mat, and having adhering to it, in one spot, a chicken’s feather. As soon as the two friends had entered the hall of the Presence they perceived that the President was NOT alone, but, on the contrary, had seated by his side Sobakevitch, whose form had hitherto been concealed by the intervening mirror. The newcomers’ entry evoked sundry exclamations and the pushing back of a pair of Government chairs as the voluminous-sleeved Sobakevitch rose into view from behind the looking-glass. Chichikov the President received with an embrace, and for a while the hall of the Presence resounded with osculatory salutations as mutually the pair inquired after one another’s health. It seemed that both had lately had a touch of that pain under the waistband which comes of a sedentary life. Also, it seemed that the President had just been conversing with Sobakevitch on the subject of sales of souls, since he now proceeded to congratulate Chichikov on the same—a proceeding which rather embarrassed our hero, seeing that Manilov and Sobakevitch, two of the vendors, and persons with whom he had bargained in the strictest privacy, were now confronting one another direct. However, Chichikov duly thanked the President, and then, turning to Sobakevitch, inquired after HIS health.","“This one here will take you to the front office,” said Ivan Antonovich, nodding his head, and one of the votaries, right there beside them, who had been sacrificing to Themis so zealously that he had gone through both coatsleeves at the elbow and the lining had long been sticking out, for which in due time he had been made a collegiate registrar, offered his services to our friends, as Virgil once offered his services to Dante, and led them to the front office, where there stood nothing but a wide armchair and in it, at a desk, behind a zertsalo31 and two thick books, alone as the sun, sat the magistrate. In this place the new Virgil felt such awe that he simply did not dare to set foot in it, but turned away, showing his back, threadbare as a bast mat, with a chicken feather stuck to it somewhere. Entering the chamber of the front office, they saw that the magistrate was not alone, Sobakevich was sitting with him, completely hidden by the zertsalo. The visitors’ arrival produced exclamations, the governmental armchair was noisily pushed back. Sobakevich, too, rose from his chair, and he and his long sleeves became visible from all sides. The magistrate took Chichikov into his embrace, and the office resounded with kisses; they inquired after each other’s health; it turned out that they both had some slight lower-back pain, which was straightaway ascribed to the sedentary life. The magistrate seemed already to have been informed of the purchase by Sobakevich, because he set about offering congratulations, which embarrassed our hero somewhat at first, especially when he saw that Sobakevich and Manilov, both sellers with whom deals had been struck in private, were now standing face to face. However, he thanked the magistrate and, turning at once to Sobakevich, asked:","“There, he’ll bring you to the Chairman’s office,” said Ivan Antonovich with a nod of his head, and one of the ministrants nearby, who had sacrificed at the altar of Themis so arduously that both his sleeves had burst at the elbows and had long since been obtruding their lining, for which zeal he had even attained in his time the lowest rung in the ladder of ranks, that of Collegiate Registrar, served our friends even as Virgil once had served Dante, and guided them to the Chairman’s office, where there was but one capacious armchair; behind a desk with two thick tomes and a trihedral column that was surmounted by the imperial coat of arms and a decree of Peter the First on each side, sat the Chairman himself, solitary as the sun. Before the portals of this place the new Virgil experienced such reverent awe that he by no means dared to set his foot over the threshold and turned about, showing a back that was as frayed as an old straw mat with here and there a bit of down sticking to it. As they entered this official chamber they perceived that the Chairman was not alone; near him sat Sobakevich, who had been entirely screened by the trihedral symbol of authority. The arrival of the newcomers evoked an exclamation; the administrative throne was shoved back noisily. Sobakevich also rose up from his chair and became visible on every side, long sleeves and all. The Chairman took Chichikov into his embraces and the chamber resounded with kisses; they inquired about each other’s health, whereupon it turned out that each had an occasional pain in the small of his back, which was at once explained by their sedentary mode of life. The Chairman, apparently, had already been informed by Sobakevich about Chichikov’s purchase, since he started congratulating him, which at first embarrassed our hero somewhat, especially when he perceived that both Sobakevich and Manilov, the two sellers, with each of whom he had put the deal through privately, were now standing together and face to face. However, he thanked the Chairman and, immediately turning to Sobakevich, asked:"

"Полковник воскипел благородным негодованьем. Тут же, схвативши бумагу и перо, написал восемь строжайших запросов: на каком основании комиссия построений самоуправно распорядилась с неподведомственными ей чиновниками? Как мог допустить главноуправляющий, чтобы председатель, не сдавши своего поста, отправился на следствие? и как мог видеть равнодушно комитет сельских дел, что даже не существует комиссии прошений?","The Colonel fumed with noble indignation. Immediately, grabbing paper and pen, he wrote eight strict requests: on what basis did the construction commission arbitrarily dispose of officials not under its control? How could the chief executive allow the chairman, without giving up his post, to go to the investigation? and how could the committee of rural affairs see with indifference that there was not even a commission of petitions?",The colonel boiled over with righteous indignation; he immediately wrote off eight severe inquiries: on what grounds the Committee of Construction without authorisation disposed of officials who were not in their department? How could the chief steward allow the president to go off to an investigation without giving up his post? And how can the Board of Rural Affairs see with indifference that the Committee for All Sorts of Petitions doesn’t even exist?,"At once the Colonel flamed to noble rage. Pressing Chichikov ’s hand in token of gratitude for the information which the guest had furnished, he took paper and pen, and noted eight searching questions under three separate headings: (1) “Why has the Committee of Management presumed to issue orders to officials not under its jurisdiction?” (2) “Why has the Chief Manager permitted his predecessor, though still in retention of his post, to follow him to another Department?” and (3) “Why has the Committee of Estate Affairs suffered the Office for the Reception of Reports and Returns to lapse?”",The colonel seethed with noble indignation. Seizing pen and paper he straightaway wrote eight most severe inquiries: on what grounds had the building commission arbitrarily disposed of officials outside its jurisdiction? How could the steward-in-chief have allowed the chairman to go on an investigation without handing over his post? And how could the village affairs committee regard with indifference the fact that the committee for petitions did not even exist?,

"Барин барахтался и, желая выпутаться, перевернулся на спину, брюхом вверх, запутавшись еще в сетку. Боясь оборвать сеть, плыл он вместе с пойманною рыбою, приказавши себя перехватить только впоперек веревкой. Перевязавши его веревкой, бросили конец ее на берег. Человек с двадцать рыбаков, стоявших на берегу, подхватили конец и стали бережно тащить его. Добравшись до мелкого места, барин стал на ноги, покрытый клетками сети, как в летнее время дамская ручка под сквозной перчаткой, — взглянул вверх и увидел гостя, в коляске взъезжавшего на плотину. Увидя гостя, кивнул он головой. Чичиков снял картуз и учтиво раскланялся с коляски.","The master floundered and, wanting to extricate himself, rolled over onto his back, belly up, still entangled in the net. Fearing to break the net, he swam along with the caught fish, ordering himself to be intercepted only across the rope. Having tied it with a rope, they threw the end of it onto the shore. A man with twenty fishermen standing on the shore picked up the line and carefully began to drag it. Having reached a shallow place, the master stood up, covered with cages of the net, like a lady's pen under a transparent glove in the summer, looked up and saw a guest in a carriage driving up to the dam. Seeing the guest, he nodded his head. Chichikov took off his cap and bowed politely from the carriage.","The gentleman floundered about and trying to disentangle himself, turned on his back, belly upwards, and became more entangled than ever. Afraid of breaking the net he swam together with the fish that had been caught, telling them to tie a cord round him. Tying him with the cord they flung the end of it on to the bank. Some twenty fishermen standing on the bank caught hold of the end and began carefully hauling it in. When he reached shallow water the gentleman stood up, covered with the meshes of the net like a lady ’s hand covered with her openwork summer glove, glanced upwards and caught sight of the visitor driving along the dam in the carriage. Seeing a visitor he nodded to him. Tchitchikov took off his cap and politely bowed from the carriage.","Yes, even if he had turned head over heels in an effort to dive, the water would persistently have borne him up; and the same if, say, a couple of men had jumped on his back— the only result would have been that he would have become a trifle deeper submerged, and forced to draw breath by spouting bubbles through his nose. No, the cause of his agitation was lest the net should break, and the fish escape: wherefore he was urging some additional peasants who were standing on the bank to lay hold of and to pull at, an extra rope or two. “That must be the barin—Colonel Koshkarev,” said Selifan. “Why?” asked Chichikov. “Because, if you please, his skin is whiter than the rest, and he has the respectable paunch of a gentleman.” Meanwhile good progress was being made with the hauling in of the barin; until, feeling the ground with his feet, he rose to an upright position, and at the same moment caught sight of the koliaska, with Chichikov seated therein, descending the declivity.","The squire floundered and, wishing to disentangle himself, turned over on his back, belly up, getting still more tangled in the net. Fearful of tearing it, he was floating together with the caught fish, only ordering them to tie a rope around him. When they had tied a rope around him, they threw the end to shore. Some twenty fishermen standing on the shore picked it up and began carefully to haul him in. On reaching a shallow spot, the squire stood up, all covered with the meshes of the net, like a lady’s hand in a net glove in summer—looked up, and saw the visitor driving onto the dam in his coach. Seeing the visitor, he nodded to him. Chichikov took off his cap and bowed courteously from his coach.",
"Ухватливый и ловкий детина лет семнадцати, в красивой рубашке розовой ксандрейки, принес и поставил перед ними графины с водой и разноцветными квасами всех сортов, шипевшими, как газовые лимонады. Поставивши пред ними графины, он подошел к дереву и, взявши прислоненный к нему заступ, отправился в сад. У братьев Платоновых вся дворня работала в саду, все слуги были садовники, или лучше сказать, слуг не было, но садовники исправляли иногда эту должность. Брат Василий все утверждал, что без слуг можно обойтись. Подать что-нибудь может всякий, и для этого не стоит заводить особого сословья; что будто русский человек по тех пор только хорош, и расторопен, и красив, и развязен, и много работает, покуда он ходит в рубашке и зипуне, но что, как только заберется в немецкий сертук — станет и неуклюж, и некрасив, и нерасторопен, и лентяй. Он утверждал, что и чистоплотность у него содержится по тех пор, покуда он еще носит рубашку и зипун, и что, как только заберется в немецкий сертук — и рубашки не переменяет, и в баню не ходит, и спит в сертуке, и заведутся у него под сертуком и клопы, и блохи, и черт знает что. В этом, может быть, он был и прав. В деревне их народ одевался как-то особенно щеголевато и опрятно, и таких красивых рубашек и зипунов нужно было далеко поискать.","A quick-witted and dexterous fellow of about seventeen, in a beautiful shirt of a pink xandreyka, brought and placed in front of them carafes of water and multi-colored kvass of all kinds, hissing like gas lemonades. Putting the decanters before them, he went up to the tree, and taking the spade that was leaning against it, went into the garden. For the Platonov brothers, all the servants worked in the garden, all the servants were gardeners, or rather, there were no servants, but gardeners sometimes corrected this position. Brother Vasily kept insisting that servants could be dispensed with. Anyone can submit something, and for this it is not necessary to start a special estate; that since then a Russian person has only been good, and quick, and handsome, and swagger, and works hard as long as he walks in a shirt and a coat, but that as soon as he gets into a German frock coat, he will become clumsy, and ugly, and slow , and lazy. He maintained that he maintained cleanliness as long as he was still wearing a shirt and an zipun, and that as soon as he got into a German coat, he wouldn’t change his shirt, didn’t go to the bathhouse, and slept in a coat, and they started there are bedbugs and fleas and the devil knows what under his coat. In this he may have been right. In the village, their people dressed in a particularly dapper and neat way, and such beautiful shirts and zipuns had to be looked for far away.","A smart deft youth of seventeen in a handsome pink cotton shirt brought a decanter of water and bottles of kvasseq of various kinds and colours, fizzing like effervescent lemonade. After setting the decanters before them he went up to a tree and, picking up a spade that was leaning against it, went off into the garden. At the Platonovs’ all the house serfs worked in the garden, all the servants were gardeners, or to put it more correctly, there were no servants, but the gardeners sometimes performed their duties. Vassily Platonov always maintained that one could do without servants at all: any one, he said, could hand things, and it was not necessary to have a separate class of people to do it; and that a Russian is only nice and alert and handsome and unconstrained and works well so long as he wears a shirt and jerkin, but that as soon as he gets into a German coat he becomes ungainly and ugly and lazy and dawdling. He even declared that the peasants’ cleanliness was only preserved so long as they wore the Russian shirt and jerkin, and that as soon as they got into a German coat they gave up changing their shirts and going to the bath, and took to sleeping in their coats and that bugs, fleas and God knows what besides began to breed under their coats. Perhaps he was right in this. In their villages the peasants dressed with peculiar neatness and smartness, and one might have looked far to find such handsome shirts and jerkins.","Vassili invited Chichikov to seat himself, and the party approached, for that purpose, the benches under the lime trees; after which a youth of about seventeen, and clad in a red shirt, brought decanters containing various kinds of kvass (some of them as thick as syrup, and others hissing like aerated lemonade), deposited the same upon the table, and, taking up a spade which he had left leaning against a tree, moved away towards the garden. The reason of this was that in the brothers’ household, as in that of Kostanzhoglo, no servants were kept, since the whole staff were rated as gardeners, and performed that duty in rotation—Vassili holding that domestic service was not a specialised calling, but one to which any one might contribute a hand, and therefore one which did not require special menials to be kept for the purpose. Moreover, he held that the average Russian peasant remains active and willing (rather than lazy) only so long as he wears a shirt and a peasant’s smock; but that as soon as ever he finds himself put into a German tailcoat, he becomes awkward, sluggish, indolent, disinclined to change his vest or take a bath, fond of sleeping in his clothes, and certain to breed fleas and bugs under the German apparel. And it may be that Vassili was right. At all events, the brothers’ peasantry were exceedingly well clad—the women, in particular, having their head-dresses spangled with gold, and the sleeves of their blouses embroidered after the fashion of a Turkish shawl.","An adroit and deft lad of about seventeen, in a handsome pink cotton shirt, brought and set down before them carafes of water and a variety of many-colored kvasses that fizzed like lemonade. Having set the carafes down before them, he went over to a tree and, taking the hoe that was leaning against it, went to the garden. All the household serfs of the Platonov brothers worked in the garden, all the servants were gardeners, or, better, there were no servants, but the gardeners sometimes performed their duties. Brother Vassily always maintained that one could do without servants. Anyone can bring anything, and it was not worth having a special class of people for that; the Russian man is good, efficient, handsome, nimble, and hardworking only as long as he goes about in a shirt and homespun jacket, but as soon as he gets into a German frock coat, he becomes awkward, uncomely, inefficient, and lazy. He maintained that he keeps himself clean only so long as he wears a shirt and homespun jacket, but as soon as he gets into a German frock coat, he stops changing his shirt, does not go to the bathhouse, sleeps in the frock coat, and under it breeds bedbugs, fleas, and devil knows what. In this he may even have been right. The people on their estate dressed somehow especially neatly and nattily, and one would have had to go far to find such handsome shirts and jackets.",

"Манилов был совершенно растроган. Оба приятеля долго жали друг другу руку и долго смотрели молча один другому в глаза, в которых видны были навернувшиеся слезы. Манилов никак не хотел выпустить руки нашего героя и продолжал жать ее так горячо, что тот уже не знал, как ее выручить.

"Ну, уж после таких слов, произнесенных приятною дамою, должна была неминуемо последовать буря, но, к величайшему изумлению, обе дамы вдруг приутихли, и совершенно ничего не последовало. Во всех отношениях приятная дама вспомнила, что выкройка для модного платья еще не находится в ее руках, а просто приятная дама смекнула, что она еще не успела выведать никаких подробностей насчет открытия, сделанного ее искреннею приятельницею, и потому мир последовал очень скоро. Впрочем, обе дамы нельзя сказать чтобы имели в своей натуре потребность наносить неприятность, и вообще в характерах их ничего не было злого, а так, нечувствительно, в разговоре рождалось само собою маленькое желание кольнуть друг друга; просто одна другой из небольшого наслаждения при случае всунет иное живое словцо: вот, мол, тебе! на, возьми, съешь! Разного рода бывают потребности в сердцах как мужеского, так и женского пола.","Well, after such words, uttered by a pleasant lady, a storm was bound to follow, but, to the greatest amazement, both ladies suddenly calmed down, and absolutely nothing followed. The pleasant lady in all respects remembered that the pattern for the fashionable dress was not yet in her hands, but simply the pleasant lady realized that she had not yet had time to find out any details about the discovery made by her sincere friend, and therefore peace followed very soon. However, it cannot be said that both ladies had in their nature the need to cause trouble, and in general there was nothing evil in their characters, but so, insensibly, in conversation, a small desire to prick each other was born of itself; it’s just that, out of a little pleasure, one another will, on occasion, stick in a different living word: here, they say, for you! take it, eat it! There are different kinds of needs in the hearts of both male and female.","It might have seemed inevitable that a storm should follow these observations of the agreeable lady, but, marvellous to relate, both ladies suddenly subsided and nothing whatever followed. The lady agreeable in all respects remembered that the pattern of the new fashion was not yet in her possession, and the simply agreeable lady reflected that she had not yet succeeded in extracting any details of the affair that her bosom friend had just revealed to her, and so peace was very quickly restored. It could not be said, however, of either of the ladies that the desire to make herself disagreeable was characteristic; indeed there was nothing spiteful in their disposition, it was simply that in conversation a slight inclination to stick pins in one another sprang up of itself unconsciously. It was simply that each derived some slight gratification from slipping in a sharp word at the expense of the other, as much as to say: “That’s one for you!” “Take that to yourself! ” There are all sorts of impulses in the hearts of the feminine as well as of the masculine sex.",“Yes; and I should say that one of those accomplices is Nozdrev.”,"Well, now, after such words uttered by the agreeable lady, a storm had inevitably to ensue, but, to the greatest amazement, the two ladies suddenly quieted down, and absolutely nothing ensued. The lady agreeable in all respects recalled that the pattern for the fashionable dress was not yet in her hands, and the simply agreeable lady realized that she had not yet succeeded in ferreting out any details with regard to the discovery made by her bosom friend, and therefore peace very quickly ensued. Incidentally, it cannot be said that either lady had in her nature any need to inflict disagreeableness, and generally there was nothing wicked in their characters, but just like that, imperceptibly, a little wish to needle each other was born of itself in the course of conversation; one of them would simply thrust a lively little phrase at the other now and then, for the sake of a little pleasure: there, that’s for you! take that and eat it! All sorts of needs exist in the hearts of both the male and the female sex.","Well, now, after such words as these, uttered by the lady who was simply agreeable, a storm was inevitably bound to break; but, most amazingly, the two ladies suddenly quieted down, and nothing whatsoever ensued. The lady who was agreeable in all respects recalled that the pattern for the latest thing in dresses was still not in her hands, while the lady who was simply agreeable surmised that she had not yet contrived to extract any details as to the discovery made by her bosom friend, and therefore peace followed very shortly. However, it could not be said of these two ladies that a necessity for saying mean things was a part of their natures, and in general there was nothing of the malicious about their characters; but, just so, without their sensing it, a slight desire to be catty to each other would be engendered of itself in their conversation; one of them, for the sake of a little gratification, would, when the occasion arose, slip in a lively word or so: “There, now, that’s for you! There, have a taste of that!” Of various kinds are the urgings of the heart in mankind—and womankind."

Just recently I sent straight to St. Petersburg to mitigate his fate.","“For God’s sake,” said the prince with visible emotion. “Do you know something about it? Tell me. I have only lately sent to Petersburg to mitigate his punishment.”","“If,” exclaimed the Prince excitedly, “you know anything further concerning the case, for God’s sake tell it me at once. Only the other day did I forward a recommendation that St. Petersburg should remit a portion of the sentence.”","“For God’s sake …” the prince said with visible agitation, “tell me, do you know anything about it? I just recently wrote directly to Petersburg about alleviating his lot.”",
"Не так ли и ты, Русь, что бойкая необгонимая тройка несешься? Дымом дымится под тобою дорога, гремят мосты, все отстает и остается позади. Остановился пораженный божьим чудом созерцатель: не молния ли это, сброшенная с неба? что значит это наводящее ужас движение? и что за неведомая сила заключена в сих неведомых светом конях? Эх, кони, кони, что за кони! Вихри ли сидят в ваших гривах? Чуткое ли ухо горит во всякой вашей жилке? Заслышали с вышины знакомую песню, дружно и разом напрягли медные груди и, почти не тронув копытами земли, превратились в одни вытянутые линии, летящие по воздуху, и мчится вся вдохновенная богом!.. Русь, куда ж несешься ты? дай ответ. Не дает ответа. Чудным звоном заливается колокольчик; гремит и становится ветром разорванный в куски воздух; летит мимо все, что ни есть на земли, и, косясь, постораниваются и дают ей дорогу другие народы и государства.","Isn't it true that you too, Russia, that a brisk, unbeatable troika are rushing about? The road smokes under you, the bridges rumble, everything lags behind and is left behind.

Oh, horses, horses, what horses! Are whirlwinds sitting in your manes? Does a sensitive ear burn in every vein of yours? They heard a familiar song from above, together and at once strained their copper breasts and, almost without touching the ground with their hooves, turned into only elongated lines flying through the air, and all inspired by God rushes! ..

Is there some delicate sense tingling in every vein? They hear the familiar song over their heads—at once in uni son they strain their iron chests and scarcely touching the earth with their hoofs are transformed almost into straight lines flying through the air—and the troika rushes on, full of divine inspiration.... Russia, whither flyest thou? Answer! She gives no answer. The ringing of the bells melts into music; the air, torn to shreds, whirs and rushes like the wind, everything there is on earth is flying by, and the other states and nations, with looks askance, make way for her and draw aside.","And you, Russia of mine—are not you also speeding like a troika which nought can overtake? Is not the road smoking beneath your wheels, and the bridges thundering as you cross them, and everything being left in the rear, and the spectators, struck with the portent, halting to wonder whether you be not a thunderbolt launched from heaven? What does that awe-inspiring progress of yours foretell? What is the unknown force which lies within your mysterious steeds? Surely the winds themselves must abide in their manes, and every vein in their bodies be an ear stretched to catch the celestial message which bids them, with iron-girded breasts, and hooves which barely touch the earth as they gallop, fly forward on a mission of God? Whither, then, are you speeding, O Russia of mine? Whither? Answer me! But no answer comes—only the weird sound of your collar-bells.

Whither art thou soaring away to, then, Russia? Give me thy answer! But Russia gives none. With a wondrous ring does the jingle bell trill; the air, rent to shreds, thunders and turns to wind; all things on earth fly past, and eyeing it askance, all the other peoples and nations stand aside and give it the right of way."
"Селифан помог взлезть девчонке на козлы, которая, ставши одной ногой на барскую ступеньку, сначала запачкала ее грязью, а потом уже взобралась на верхушку и поместилась возле него. Вслед за нею и сам Чичиков занес ногу на ступеньку и, понагнувши бричку на правую сторону, потому что был тяжеленек, наконец поместился, сказавши:","Selifan helped the girl climb onto the goats, who, having put one foot on the master's step, first soiled it with mud, and then climbed to the top and placed herself next to him.

"Получив же в свое распоряжение все, в ту же минуту дал знать обществу, сказавши: «Теперь пора». Расчет был слишком верен. Тут в один год он мог получить то, чего не выиграл бы в двадцать лет самой ревностной службы. Прежде он не хотел вступать ни в какие сношения с ними, потому что был не более как простой пешкой, стало быть, немного получил бы; но теперь… теперь совсем другое дело: он мог предложить какие угодно условия. Чтобы дело шло беспрепятственней, он склонил и другого чиновника, своего товарища, который не устоял против соблазна, несмотря на то, что волосом был сед. Условия были заключены, и общество приступило к действиям. Действия начались блистательно: читатель, без сомнения, слышал так часто повторяемую историю об остроумном путешествии испанских баранов, которые, совершив переход через границу в двойных тулупчиках, пронесли под тулупчиками на миллион брабантских кружев. Это происшествие случилось именно тогда, когда Чичиков служил при таможне. Не участвуй он сам в этом предприятии, никаким жидам в мире не удалось бы привести в исполнение подобного дела. После трех или четырех бараньих походов через границу у обоих чиновников очутилось по четыреста тысяч капиталу. У Чичикова, говорят, даже перевалило и за пятьсот, потому что был побойчее. Бог знает до какой бы громадной цифры не возросли благодатные суммы, если бы какой-то нелегкий зверь не перебежал поперек всему. Черт сбил с толку обоих чиновников; чиновники, говоря попросту, перебесились и поссорились ни за что. Как-то в жарком разговоре, а может быть, несколько и выпивши, Чичиков назвал другого чиновника поповичем, а тот, хотя действительно был попович, неизвестно почему обиделся жестоко и ответил ему тут же сильно и необыкновенно резко, именно вот как: «Нет, врешь, я статский советник, а не попович, а вот ты так попович!» И потом еще прибавил ему в пику для большей досады: «Да вот, мол, что!» Хотя он отбрил таким образом его кругом, обратив на него им же приданное название, и хотя выражение «вот, мол, что!» могло быть сильно, но, недовольный сим, он послал еще на него тайный донос. Впрочем, говорят, что и без того была у них ссора за какую-то бабенку, свежую и крепкую, как ядреная репа, по выражению таможенных чиновников; что были даже подкуплены люди, чтобы под вечерок в темном переулке поизбить нашего героя; но что оба чиновника были в дураках и бабенкой воспользовался какой-то штабс-капитан Шамшарев. Как было дело в самом деле, бог их ведает; пусть лучше читатель-охотник досочинит сам. Главное в том, что тайные сношения с контрабандистами сделались явными. Статский советник хоть и сам пропал, но-таки упек своего товарища. Чиновников взяли под суд, конфисковали, описали все, что у них ни было, и все это разрешилось вдруг как гром над головами их. Как после чаду опомнились они и увидели с ужасом, что наделали. Статский советник, по русскому обычаю, с горя запил, но коллежский устоял. Он умел затаить часть деньжонок, как ни чутко было обоняние наехавшего на следствие начальства. Употребил все тонкие извороты ума, уже слишком опытного, слишком знающего хорошо людей: где подействовал приятностью оборотов, где трогательной речью, где покурил лестью, ни в коем случае не портящею дела, где всунул деньжонку, — словом, обработал дело, по крайней мере, так, что отставлен был не с таким бесчестьем, как товарищ, и увернулся из-под уголовного суда. Но уже ни капитала, ни разных заграничных вещиц, ничего не осталось ему; на все это нашлись другие охотники. Удержалось у него тысячонок десяток, запрятанных про черный день, да дюжины две голландских рубашек, да небольшая бричка, в какой ездят холостяки, да два крепостных человека, кучер Селифан и лакей Петрушка, да таможенные чиновники, движимые сердечною добротою, оставили ему пять или шесть кусков мыла для сбережения свежести щек — вот и все. Итак, вот в каком положении вновь очутился герой наш! Вот какая громада бедствий обрушилась ему на голову! Это называл он: потерпеть по службе за правду. Теперь можно бы заключить, что после таких бурь, испытаний, превратностей судьбы и жизненного горя он удалится с оставшимися кровными десятью тысчонками в какое-нибудь мирное захолустье уездного городишка и там заклекнет вовеки в ситцевом халате у окна низенького домика, разбирая по воскресным дням драку мужиков, возникшую пред окнами, или для освежения пройдясь в курятник пощупать лично курицу, назначенную в суп, и проведет таким образом нешумный, но в своем роде тоже небесполезный век. Но так не случилось. Надобно отдать справедливость непреодолимой силе его характера. После всего того, что бы достаточно было если не убить, то охладить и усмирить навсегда человека, в нем не потухла непостижимая страсть. Он был в горе, в досаде, роптал на весь свет, сердился на несправедливость судьбы, негодовал на несправедливость людей и, однако же, не мог отказаться от новых попыток. Словом, он показал терпенье, пред которым ничто деревянное терпенье немца, заключенное уже в медленном, ленивом обращении крови его. Кровь Чичикова, напротив, играла сильно, и нужно было много разумной воли, чтоб набросить узду на все то, что хотело бы выпрыгнуть и погулять на свободе. Он рассуждал, и в рассуждении его видна была некоторая сторона справедливости: «Почему ж я? зачем на меня обрушилась беда? Кто ж зевает теперь на должности? — все приобретают. Несчастным я не сделал никого: я не ограбил вдову, я не пустил никого по миру, пользовался я от избытков, брал там, где всякий брал бы; не воспользуйся я, другие воспользовались бы. За что же другие благоденствуют, и почему должен я пропасть червем? И что я теперь? Куда я гожусь? какими глазами я стану смотреть теперь в глаза всякому почтенному отцу семейства? Как не чувствовать мне угрызения совести, зная, что даром бременю землю, и что скажут потом мои дети? Вот, скажут, отец, скотина, не оставил нам никакого состояния!»","Having received everything at his disposal, at the same moment he let the society know, saying: ""Now is the time."" The calculation was too correct. Here in one year he could receive what he would not have won in twenty years of the most zealous service. Previously, he did not want to enter into any relations with them, because he was nothing more than a mere pawn, therefore, he would have received little; but now ... now it's quite another matter: he could offer any conditions. To make things go smoothly, he persuaded another official, his comrade, who could not resist the temptation, despite the fact that his hair was gray. The terms were agreed upon and the society set to work. The action began brilliantly: the reader, no doubt, has heard the so often repeated story about the witty journey of the Spanish rams, who, having crossed the border in double sheepskin coats, carried a million Brabant laces under their sheepskin coats. This incident happened exactly when Chichikov served at the customs. If he himself had not participated in this enterprise, no Jews in the world would have been able to carry out such a deed. After three or four sheep's marches across the border, both officials ended up with four hundred thousand capital each. Chichikov's, they say, even exceeded five hundred, because he was a bit happier. God knows to what enormous figure the blessed sums would not have increased, if some difficult beast had not run across everything. The devil confused both officials; officials, to put it simply, went berserk and quarreled for nothing. Somehow, in a heated conversation, or maybe after drinking a little, Chichikov called another official a priest, and the latter, although he really was a priest, for some unknown reason, was cruelly offended and answered him immediately strongly and unusually sharply, just like this: “No, you’re lying, I’m a state councilor, not a priest, but you’re such a priest!” And then he added to him in defiance for greater annoyance: “Yes, they say, what!” Although he thus shaved it all around, turning on him the name given to him, and although the expression ""that's what, they say!"" could be strong, but, dissatisfied with this, he sent a secret denunciation to him. However, they say that they already had a quarrel over some kind of wench, fresh and strong, like a vigorous turnip, in the words of customs officials; that people were even bribed to beat our hero in the evening in a dark alley; but that both officials were fools and some staff captain Shamsharev took advantage of the woman. As it was in fact, God knows them; better let the reader-hunter compose himself. The main thing is that secret relations with smugglers have become clear. The State Councilor, although he himself disappeared, nevertheless killed his comrade. Officials were taken to court, confiscated, described everything that they had, and all this was suddenly resolved like a thunder over their heads. How after a daze they came to their senses and saw with horror what they had done. The state councilor, according to Russian custom, took to drink with grief, but the collegiate resisted. He knew how to hold back part of the money, no matter how sensitive the sense of smell of the authorities who came to the investigation was. He used all the subtle tricks of the mind, already too experienced, knowing people too well: where he acted with pleasant turns, where with touching speech, where he smoked with flattery, which in no way spoils the case, where he slipped a little money - in a word, he handled the matter, at least so that he was dismissed not with such dishonor as his comrade, and dodged from under the criminal court. But no capital, no various foreign gizmos, nothing left him; for all this there were other hunters. He kept a thousand tens hidden about a rainy day, and two dozen Dutch shirts, and a small britzka, in which bachelors ride, and two serfs, the coachman Selifan and the footman Petrushka, and the customs officials, driven by kindness of heart, left him five or six bars of soap to preserve the freshness of the cheeks - that's all. So, this is the position in which our hero found himself again! What a huge disaster fell on his head! He called it: to suffer in the service for the truth. Now we can conclude that after such storms, trials, vicissitudes of fate and life's grief, he will retire with the remaining ten thousand dollars in blood to some peaceful outback of a county town and there he will shut up forever in a cotton robe at the window of a low house, sorting out the fight of peasants on Sundays , which arose in front of the windows, or for refreshment, going into the chicken coop to personally feel the chicken assigned to the soup, and in this way will spend a quiet, but in its own way also not useful age. But that didn't happen. We must do justice to the irresistible force of his character. After all that would be enough, if not to kill, then to cool and pacify a person forever, an incomprehensible passion did not go out in him. He was in grief, in annoyance, murmuring to the whole world, angry at the injustice of fate, indignant at the injustice of people, and yet he could not refuse new attempts. In a word, he showed patience, before which the wooden patience of a German, already contained in the slow, lazy circulation of his blood, is nothing. Chichikov's blood, on the contrary, played strongly, and a lot of reasonable will was needed to throw a bridle on everything that would like to jump out and walk in freedom. He reasoned, and in his reasoning a certain side of justice was visible: “Why me? why did I get in trouble? Who is yawning now in office? - everyone buys. I did not make anyone unhappy: I did not rob the widow, I did not let anyone into the world, I used from the excess, I took where anyone would take; If I didn't use it, others would. Why do others prosper, and why should I be a worm? And what am I now? Where do I fit? With what eyes shall I now look into the eyes of every venerable father of a family? How can I not feel remorse, knowing that I am burdening the earth for nothing, and what will my children say later? Here, they will say, father, cattle, did not leave us any fortune!","When he had received full control he sent word to the society saying: “The time has come now.” His calculation was only too correct. Now he could gain in one year what he could not have made by twenty years of the most zealous service. He had not before been willing to enter into relations with them because he had been nothing but a humble pawn and so could not have got much; but now . . . now it was quite a different matter: he could make any terms he liked. That the thing might go through without hindrance he brought into it another man, a colleague of his, who could not resist temptation although his hair was grey. The terms were fixed and the society set to work. The enterprise began brilliantly. The reader has no doubt often heard the story of the clever journey of the Spanish sheep who, crossing the frontier in two sheep-skins, carried over Brabant lace to the value of millions of roubles under their fleeces. This incident took place at the time when Tchitchikov was in the customs. Had he not had a hand in this enterprise no Jews in the world could have succeeded in carrying out such an undertaking. After three or four flocks of sheep had crossed the frontier the two customs house officials found themselves in possession of a capital of four hundred thousand roubles. Tchitchikov is said to have made five hundred thousand because he was a little sharper. Goodness knows to what immense figure their gains might have swelled, had not an unlucky chance in an evil hour ruined everything. The devil confounded the two officials. To speak plainly the officials lost their temper and quarrelled about nothing. In some heated conversation, possibly after too much to drink, Tchitchikov called his colleague a priest’s son, and, though he really was a priest’s son, the latter, why I cannot say, was bitterly offended and answered him at once forcibly and extremely cuttingly in these words: “That’s a lie, I’m a civil councillor and not a priest’s son, but you are a priest’s son,” and added to annoy him further: “so that’s all about it.” Though he did score off him in this way, throwing the offensive epithet back at him, and though the expression, “So that’s all about it!” may have been a strong one, he was not satisfied with that, he gave secret information against him. Though indeed they do say that they were at loggerheads already over some woman as fresh and firm as a juicy turnip, to use the expression of the customs officials, that men had even been bribed to waylay our hero some evening in a dark alley and beat him within an inch of his life, but that she made fools of both the officials and really bestowed her favours on a staff-captain, called Shamsharev. How it really was, God only knows; the reader who cares to may complete the story for himself. The chief point is that their secret relations with the smugglers were discovered. Though the civil councillor was himself ruined, he certainly brought his colleague to grief also. The officials were brought to justice, an inventory was made of everything they had and all was confiscated, and all this fell like a thunderbolt on their heads. They came to themselves as after delirium, and saw with horror what they had done. The civil councillor had not the fortitude to endure his fate and perished in obscurity, but the collegiate councillor faced his troubles bravely. He succeeded in concealing part of the money in spite of the keen scent of the officials who were tracking him; he brought into play all the subtle wiles of a brain of much experience and deep understanding of men; with one he tried his agreeable address, with another pathetic appeal, with one he employed flattery, which never comes amiss, into another’s hands he slipped money, in short he managed things so far successfully at least, as to get off with less ignominy than his colleague, and to escape trial on a criminal charge. But both his fortune and all his foreign treasures were lost: other amateurs of such things turned up to secure them. All he managed to keep was a paltry ten thousand, carefully put away for a rainy day, two dozen linen shirts, a small chaise such as bachelor gentlemen drive about in, and two serfs, the coachman Selifan and the footman Petrushka; and the customs house officials, moved by genuine sympathy, left him five or six pieces of soap for preserving the freshness of the complexion— that was all! This was the position in which our hero found himself again! Such was the immensity of the catastrophe that overtook him. This was what he called suffering in a good cause. It might have been expected that after such storms, such trials, such fluctuations of destiny and troubles in life, he would retire with his precious ten thousand to the peaceful seclusion of some little district town and there vegetate for ever in a chintz dressing-gown at the window of a little low-pitched house, watching on Sundays the peasants fighting under his window, or for fresh air and exercise walking into the poultry yard to feel with his own hands the hen destined for soup, and so lead an inglorious but not altogether useless existence. But this did not happen. One must do justice to the invincible strength of his character. After misfortunes that were enough if not to kill, at least to cool and subdue a man for ever, his indomitable passion was not quenched. He was plunged in grief and vexation, he murmured against the whole world, was wroth with the injustice of destiny, indignant at the injustice of men, and yet he could not resign himself to abandoning all effort. In short, he displayed a patience compared with which the wooden patience of a German, due to the sluggish, languid circulation of his blood, is nothing. Tchitchikov’s blood on the other hand circulated vigorously, and he needed a great deal of good sense and strong will to keep a tight rein on all the impulses that were longing to break bounds and enjoy themselves in freedom. He argued, and there was some justice in the argument, “Why me? Why should misfortune have overtaken me? Who wastes his time in the service nowadays? They all make what they can. I have never brought trouble on any one: I haven’t robbed the widow, I have reduced no one to beggary; I have made use of what was to spare; I took where any one would have taken; if I had not made use of it, others would have. Why are other people prosperous and why should I be crushed like a worm? And what am I now? What use am I? How can I look any respectable father of a family in the face? How can I help feeling stings of conscience when I know that I am a useless burden on the earth? And what will my children say one day? ‘Our father is a beast,’ they will say, ‘he has left us no property!’ ”","But now that he had got all the reins into his hands, he sent word of the fact to the gang, and with it the remark, “The time is NOW.” Nor was he wrong in his calculations, for, within the space of a year, he had acquired what he could not have made during twenty years of non-fraudulent service. With similar sagacity he had, during his early days in the department, declined altogether to enter into relations with the association, for the reason that he had then been a mere cipher, and would have come in for nothing large in the way of takings; but now—well, now it was another matter altogether, and he could dictate what terms he liked. Moreover, that the affair might progress the more smoothly, he suborned a fellow tchinovnik of the type which, in spite of grey hairs, stands powerless against temptation; and, the contract concluded, the association duly proceeded to business. Certainly business began brilliantly. But probably most of my readers are familiar with the oft-repeated story of the passage of Spanish sheep across the frontier in double fleeces which carried between their outer layers and their inner enough lace of Brabant to sell to the tune of millions of roubles; wherefore I will not recount the story again beyond saying that those journeys took place just when Chichikov had become head of the Customs, and that, had he not a hand in the enterprise, not all the Jews in the world could have brought it to success. By the time that three or four of these ovine invasions had taken place, Chichikov and his accomplice had come to be the possessors of four hundred thousand roubles apiece; while some even aver that the former’s gains totalled half a million, owing to the greater industry which he had displayed in the matter. Nor can any one but God say to what a figure the fortunes of the pair might not eventually have attained, had not an awkward contretemps cut right across their arrangements. That is to say, for some reason or another the devil so far deprived these tchinovnik-conspirators of sense as to make them come to words with one another, and then to engage in a quarrel. Beginning with a heated argument, this quarrel reached the point of Chichikov—who was, possibly, a trifle tipsy—calling his colleague a priest’s son; and though that description of the person so addressed was perfectly accurate, he chose to take offence, and to answer Chichikov with the words (loudly and incisively uttered), “ It is YOU who have a priest for your father,” and to add to that (the more to incense his companion), “Yes, mark you! THAT is how it is.” Yet, though he had thus turned the tables upon Chichikov with a tu quoque, and then capped that exploit with the words last quoted, the offended tchinovnik could not remain satisfied, but went on to send in an anonymous document to the authorities. On the other hand, some aver that it was over a woman that the pair fell out—over a woman who, to quote the phrase then current among the staff of the Customs Department, was “as fresh and as strong as the pulp of a turnip,” and that night-birds were hired to assault our hero in a dark alley, and that the scheme miscarried, and that in any case both Chichikov and his friend had been deceived, seeing that the person to whom the lady had really accorded her favours was a certain staff-captain named Shamsharev. However, only God knows the truth of the matter. Let the inquisitive reader ferret it out for himself. The fact remains that a complete exposure of the dealings with the contrabandists followed, and that the two tchinovniks were put to the question, deprived of their property, and made to formulate in writing all that they had done. Against this thunderbolt of fortune the State Councillor could make no headway, and in some retired spot or another sank into oblivion; but Chichikov put a brave face upon the matter, for, in spite of the authorities’ best efforts to smell out his gains, he had contrived to conceal a portion of them, and also resorted to every subtle trick of intellect which could possibly be employed by an experienced man of the world who has a wide knowledge of his fellows. Nothing which could be effected by pleasantness of demeanour, by moving oratory, by clouds of flattery, and by the occasional insertion of a coin into a palm did he leave undone; with the result that he was retired with less ignominy than was his companion, and escaped actual trial on a criminal charge. Yet he issued stripped of all his capital, stripped of his imported effects, stripped of everything. That is to say, all that remained to him consisted of ten thousand roubles which he had stored against a rainy day, two dozen linen shirts, a small britchka of the type used by bachelors, and two serving-men named Selifan and Petrushka. Yes, and an impulse of kindness moved the tchinovniks of the Customs also to set aside for him a few cakes of the soap which he had found so excellent for the freshness of the cheeks. Thus once more our hero found himself stranded. And what an accumulation of misfortunes had descended upon his head!—though , true, he termed them “suffering in the Service in the cause of Truth.” Certainly one would have thought that, after these buffetings and trials and changes of fortune—after this taste of the sorrows of life—he and his precious ten thousand roubles would have withdrawn to some peaceful corner in a provincial town, where, clad in a stuff dressing-gown, he could have sat and listened to the peasants quarrelling on festival days, or (for the sake of a breath of fresh air) have gone in person to the poulterer’s to finger chickens for soup, and so have spent a quiet, but not wholly useless, existence; but nothing of the kind took place, and therein we must do justice to the strength of his character. In other words, although he had undergone what, to the majority of men, would have meant ruin and discouragement and a shattering of ideals, he still preserved his energy. True, downcast and angry, and full of resentment against the world in general, he felt furious with the injustice of fate, and dissatisfied with the dealings of men; yet he could not forbear courting additional experiences. In short, the patience which he displayed was such as to make the wooden persistency of the German—a persistency merely due to the slow, lethargic circulation of the Teuton’s blood—seem nothing at all, seeing that by nature Chichikov’s blood flowed strongly, and that he had to employ much force of will to curb within himself those elements which longed to burst forth and revel in freedom. He thought things over, and, as he did so, a certain spice of reason appeared in his reflections. “How have I come to be what I am?” he said to himself. “Why has misfortune overtaken me in this way? Never have I wronged a poor person, or robbed a widow, or turned any one out of doors: I have always been careful only to take advantage of those who possess more than their share. Moreover, I have never gleaned anywhere but where every one else was gleaning; and, had I not done so, others would have gleaned in my place. Why, then, should those others be prospering, and I be sunk as low as a worm? What am I? What am I good for? How can I, in future, hope to look any honest father of a family in the face? How shall I escape being tortured with the thought that I am cumbering the ground? What, in the years to come, will my children say, save that ‘our father was a brute, for he left us nothing to live upon?’”","Once everything was put at his disposal, he immediately sent word to the company, saying: “The time has now come.” The calculation was only too correct. Here he could get in one year what he could not gain in twenty years of the most zealous service. Prior to this he had not wanted to enter into any relations with them, because he was no more than a mere pawn, which meant that he would not get much; but now … now it was quite a different matter: he could offer any conditions he liked. To smooth the way, he won over another official, a colleague of his, who could not resist the temptation despite his gray hairs. The conditions were agreed to, and the company went into action. The action began brilliantly: the reader has undoubtedly heard the oft-repeated story of the clever journey of the Spanish sheep that crossed the border in double fleeces, carrying in between a million roubles’ worth of Brabant lace. This event occurred precisely when Chichikov was serving in customs. If he himself had not participated in this undertaking, no Jews in the world could have succeeded in bringing off such a thing. After three or four sheep-crossings at the border, each of the officials found himself with four hundred thousand in capital. With Chichikov, they say, it even went over five hundred thousand, because he was a bit quicker. God knows what enormous figures the blessed sums might have grown to, if some deuced beast had not crossed paths with it all. The devil befuddled both officials; to speak plainly, the officials went berserk and quarreled over nothing. Once, in a heated conversation, and perhaps being a bit tipsy, Chichikov called the other official a parson’s kid, and the man, though he was indeed a parson’s kid, for no reason at all became bitterly offended and straightaway answered him strongly and with extraordinary sharpness, namely thus: “No, lies, I’m a state councillor, not a parson’s kid, it’s you who are a parson’s kid!” And then added, to pique him to greater vexation: “ So there!” Although he told him off thus roundly, turning back on him the very title he had bestowed, and although the expression “So there!” may have been a strong one, he was not satisfied with that and also sent in a secret denunciation against him. However, they say that, to begin with, they had quarreled over some wench, fresh and firm as a ripe turnip, in the custom officials’ expression; that some people were even paid to give our hero a little beating at night in a dark alley; but that both officials were played for fools, and the wench went to the use of a certain Captain Shamsharev. How it was in reality, God only knows; better let the inventive reader think up his own ending. The main thing was that the secret connections with the smugglers became manifest. The state councillor, though ruined himself, also cooked his colleague’s goose. The officials were brought to trial, everything they had was confiscated, perquisitioned, and it all suddenly broke like thunder over their heads. They recovered as if from a stupor and saw with horror what they had done. The state councillor, following Russian custom, took to drinking from grief, but the collegiate one withstood. He managed to hide away part of the cash, despite the keen scent of the authorities who came for the investigation. He used all the subtle wiles of his mind, only too experienced by then, only too knowledgeable of people: at one point he acted by means of an agreeable manner, at another by moving speeches, at another by the incense of flattery, which never does any harm, at another by dropping a bit of cash—in short, he handled things so as to be retired with less dishonor than his colleague, and to dodge criminal proceedings. But no capital, no foreign-made trinkets, nothing was left to him; other lovers of such things had come along. All that remained to him was some ten thousand stashed away for a rainy day, that and two dozen Holland shirts, and a small britzka such as bachelors drive around in, and two serfs—the coachman Selifan and the lackey Petrushka—and the customs officials, out of the kindness of their hearts, left him five or six pieces of soap for preserving the freshness of his cheeks—that was all. And so, this was the position our hero again found himself in! This was the immense calamity that came crashing down on his head! This was what he called suffering for the truth in the service. Now it might be concluded that after such storms, trials, vicissitudes of fate, and sorrows of life, he would retire with his remaining ten thousand to the peaceful backwoods of some provincial town and there wither away forever in a chintz dressing gown at the window of a low house, on Sundays sorting out a fight between muzhiks that started up outside his windows, or refreshing himself by going to the chicken coop and personally inspecting the chicken destined for the soup, thus passing his none-too-noisy but in its own way also not quite useless life. But it did not happen so. One must do justice to the invincible force of his character. After all this, which was enough, if not to kill, then at least to cool down and subdue a man forever, the inconceivable passion did not die in him. He was aggrieved, vexed, he murmured against the whole world, was angry at the injustice of fate, indignant at the injustice of men, and, nevertheless, could not renounce new attempts. In short, he showed a patience compared with which the wooden patience of the German is nothing, consisting as it does of a slow, sluggish circulation of the blood. Chichikov’s blood, on the contrary, ran high, and much reasonable will was needed to bridle all that would have liked to leap out and play freely. He reasoned, and a certain aspect of justice could be seen in his reasoning: “ Why me? Why should the calamity have befallen me? Who just sits and gapes on the job?—everybody profits. I didn’t make anyone unhappy: I didn’t rob a widow, I didn’t send anyone begging, I made use of abundance, I took where anyone else would have taken; if I hadn’t made use of it, others would have. Why, then, do others prosper, and why must I perish like a worm? What am I now? What good am I? How will I look any respectable father of a family in the eye now? How can I not feel remorse, knowing that I’m a useless burden on the earth, and what will my children say later? There, they’ll say, is a brute of a father, he didn’t leave us any inheritance!”","But the moment he had everything placed at his disposal, he let the syndicate know, saying: “ Now’s the time.” His reckoning was all too correct. He could now receive in a single year that which he might not have won in twenty years of the most zealous service. Hitherto he had not wanted to enter into any relations with the smugglers, since he would have been no more than a common pawn, ergo, he would not have received much, but now ... now it was another matter: he could put whatever terms he liked to them. So that the business might be carried on without the least hindrance, he won over another official, a fellow worker who was unable to withstand temptation despite the fact that his hair was already gray. The terms were agreed upon and the syndicate went to work. The work began brilliantly. The reader must have heard, beyond a doubt, the oft-repeated story about the ingenious journey performed by some merino rams which, crossing the frontier in double coats of wool, carried through thereunder a millions worth of Brabant lace. This incident took place precisely at the time when Chichikov was serving in the Customs. Had not he himself taken part in this enterprise no free traders in the world, no matter how ingenious, could have brought such a matter to a successful conclusion. After those rams had crossed the frontier three or four times, the two officials found that each one had a capital of four hundred thousand rubles. Chichikov, they say, had actually amassed more than five hundred thousand, since he was smarter than the other. God knows to what an enormous figure the goodly sums would have grown, if it were not that some black cat ran across their path. The Devil made the two officials lose their wits: to put it simply, they waxed too fat and kicked their heels and had a falling out over nothing at all. Somehow, during a heated conversation, and perhaps even in his cups, Chichikov called the other official a priest’s son, while the other, who actually was a priest’s son, became for some reason sorely offended and answered Chichikov right then and there, forcefully and with unusual sharpness, in precisely the following terms: “No, you lie—I’m a State Councilor, and no priest’s son; but as for you, why you are a priest’s son for sure!” And immediately thereafter he added, just to pique and vex the other more: “ So there, that’s just what you are, now!” Although he thus won a crushing, all-around victory, having turned upon him the very name Chichikov had bestowed upon him, and although the expression “So there, that’s just what you are now!” might have been considered a strong one, yet not content with this he also lodged secret information against Chichikov. However, they do say that even without this there had been a quarrel between them over some female, as fresh and firm as a juicy turnip, to use an expression of the clerks in the Customs; it was also said that certain bravoes had been hired to waylay our hero some eventide in a dark by-lane and beat the daylights out of him, but that both officials were made fools of and that the female gave herself to a certain second captain by the name of Shamsharev. Just how it all really happened, God alone knows; it would be better for the reader, if he is willing, to make up the end of that story for himself. The main thing is that their connections with the smugglers, hitherto covert, now became overt. Even though the State Councilor was ruined himself, he had also cooked his co-worker’s goose for him. Both officials were arrested, all their worldly goods were inventoried, impounded, and confiscated, and all this broke suddenly, like a thunderbolt, over their heads. They came to, as if out of a daze, and saw with horror what they had done. The State Councilor, in the Russian manner, took to drink out of sorrow, but the Collegiate Councilor stood firm. He had been able to secrete a part of his funds, no matter how keen the scent of the higher-ups who had trooped together for the investigation; he brought into play all the fine dodges of a mind by now all too experienced and knowing people all too well: on one he’d work through the charm of his manners, on another through a touching speech, on a third through the use of the insidious incense of flattery, which in any case could do no harm in the matter; on a fourth he would use a little bribe; in short, he worked the business all around in such a way that at last he was dismissed with less ignominy than his co-worker, and got away without having to go through a trial on a criminal charge. But he had neither any great capital remaining, nor any of the sundry little thingamabobs from abroad; nothing remained to him: other willing hands had been found to grab everything that had been his. All that he had retained was some ten measly thousand, squirreled away for a rainy day, and two dozen Holland shirts, and a small light carriage, such as bachelors like to drive about in, and two serfs—Selifan the coachman and Petrushka the flunky— and, also, the clerks in the Customs House, moved by the goodness of their hearts, had left him five or six cakes of the soap for preserving the freshness of his cheeks. And that was all. And so, such was the situation in which our hero found himself anew! Such was the mountain of woes that avalanched upon his head! This was what he called suffering for the truth while serving his country. At this point it might be concluded that after such tempests, tribulations, after such slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and the grievousness of life, he would retire with his remaining measly ten thousand, which he’d won with his heart’s blood, into the peaceful backwoods of some small district town and there vegetate forever in a chintz dressing gown by the window of a squat little house, settling, of Sundays, the fights that sprang up under his windows among his muzhiks, or, for exercise and fresh air, taking a walk to his henhouse to feel with his own hands whether the hen intended for the soup was plump enough, and would thus pass his quiescent yet, after a fashion, not entirely useless old age. But things did not work out that way. One must render full justice to the insuperable strength of his character. After all that which would have sufficed, if not to kill, then at least to chill and tame any man forever, his incomprehensible passion had not become extinguished within him. He was filled with grief, with vexation; he murmured against the whole world; he was furious against the injustice of fate and indignant at the injustice of men and yet, despite everything, couldn’t abstain from making new attempts. In short, he evinced a patience before which the wooden patience of the German is as nothing, since in the case of the latter it is due to nothing but the slow, sluggish circulation of his Teutonic blood. Chichikov’s blood, on the contrary, surged mightily, and there was needed a great deal of rationalizing will to hold in check all that was fain to leap forth and have a free fling. He reasoned, and in his reasoning one could perceive a certain aspect of justice: “But why should it be I? Why has calamity crashed down upon me? Who is the man working for the government who isn’t wide awake to the main chance? They all stuff their little tin boxes. I’ve never brought misfortune upon anybody; I’ve never robbed the widow and the orphan, have never ruined any man and sent him out into the world to beg; I have merely helped myself from the surpluses. I took mine where anybody would have taken his; if I hadn’t helped myself, others would have helped themselves. Why, then, should the others prosper and wax fat and why must I perish like a miserable crushed worm? And what am I to do now? What am I good for? With what eyes can I now look into the eyes of any respectable father of a family? How can I help but feel the pangs of conscience, knowing as I do that I am cumbering the earth in vain? And what will my children say to me later on? cThere,’ they’ll say, cour father was a low-down animal, he didn’t leave us any estate whatsoever.’ “"
"Чичиков задумался. Что-то странное, какие-то неведомые дотоле, незнаемые чувства, ему необъяснимые, пришли к нему: как будто хотело в нем что-то пробудиться, что-то подавленное из детства суровым, мертвым поученьем, бесприветностью скучного детства, пустынностью родного жилища, бессемейным одиночеством, нищетой и бедностью первоначальных впечатлений, суровым взглядом судьбы, взглянувшей на него скучно, сквозь какое-то мутно занесенное зимней вьюгой окно.","Chichikov thought. Something strange, some hitherto unknown, unknown feelings, inexplicable to him, came to him; familyless loneliness, poverty and poverty of initial impressions, the stern look of fate, which looked at him boredly, through some kind of window clouded by a winter blizzard.","Tchitchikov pondered. Something strange, feelings hitherto unknown to him which he could not account for, rose in his heart: it seemed as though something were trying to awaken in him, something suppressed from childhood by the harsh, dead discipline of his dreary boyhood, by the desolateness of his home, his solitude, the niggardliness and poverty of his first impressions, and as though something, in bondage to the stern fate that looked mournfully at him as through a window darkened by the snowstorms of winter, were trying to break its chains.","“Indeed, yes!” agreed the repentant Chichikov. “Gladly will I do as you wish, since for many a day past have I been longing to amend my life, and to engage in husbandry, and to reorder my affairs. A demon, the tempter Satan himself, has beguiled me and led me from the right path.” Suddenly there had recurred to Chichikov long-unknown, long-unfamiliar feelings. Something seemed to be striving to come to life again in him—something dim and remote, something which had been crushed out of his boyhood by the dreary, deadening education of his youthful days, by his desolate home, by his subsequent lack of family ties, by the poverty and niggardliness of his early impressions, by the grim eye of fate—an eye which had always seemed to be regarding him as through a misty, mournful, frost-encrusted window-pane, and to be mocking at his struggles for freedom.","Chichikov fell to thinking. Something strange, some hitherto unknown feelings, inexplicable to himself, came to him: as if something wanted to awaken in him, something suppressed since childhood by stern, dead precepts, by the inimicalness of a dull childhood, the desolateness of his family home, by familyless solitude, abjectness, and a poverty of first impressions, by the stern glance of fate, which looked dully at him through some clouded window buried under a wintry blizzard.",
"— Как же, уж такой знакомый! в школе были приятели.","- How, so familiar! I had friends at school.","“To be sure, he is a friend! We used to be friends at school.”","“By all means.” “Yes, him I know well, for we were friends together at school.”","“Really, as if we’re not acquainted! We were friends at school.”","“Surely, and what a friend, at that! We were schoolmates.”"
"От такого предложения никто не мог отказаться… Свидетели уже при одном наименованье рыбного ряда почувствовали аппетит; взялись все тот же час за картузы и шапки, и присутствие кончилось. Когда проходили они канцелярию, Иван Антонович кувшинное рыло, учтиво поклонившись, сказал потихоньку Чичикову:","No one could refuse such an offer ... The witnesses already felt an appetite at the very name of the fish row; all the same hour they took up caps and hats, and the presence ended. As they passed through the office, Ivan Antonovich the pitcher-faced bow, politely, said quietly to Chichikov:","No one could refuse such a proposition. The mere mention of the fish market gave the witnesses an appetite; they all picked up their hats and caps, and the presidential office was closed. As they walked through the clerks’ rooms, Ivan Antonovitch, the jug scout, bowing politely, said on the quiet to Tchitchikov: “You have bought peasants for a hundred thousand and only twenty-five roubles for my trouble.”","To this proposal no one had any objection to offer, for the mere mention of the fish shop aroused the witnesses’ appetite. Consequently, the ceremony being over, there was a general reaching for hats and caps. As the party were passing through the general office, Ivan Antonovitch whispered in Chichikov’s ear, with a courteous inclination of his jug-shaped physiognomy:","To such a suggestion no one could object. The witnesses felt hungry at the mere mention of the fish market; they all straightaway picked up their hats and caps, and the session was ended. As they passed through the chancellery, Ivan Antonovich, the jug mug, with a courteous bow, said softly to Chichikov:","No one could turn down a proposal like that. The witnesses, at the mere mention of Fish Row, felt their mouths watering; all immediately picked up their caps and hats and the session was over. As they were passing through the chancellery, Ivan Antonovich, he of the juglike mug, said on the quiet to Chichikov, after making him a respectful bow: “You’ve bought up serfs for all of a hundred thousand, yet all you’ve given me for my work is a single white government note for twenty-five rubles.”"
"Покупки Чичикова сделались предметом разговоров. В городе пошли толки, мнения, рассуждения о том, выгодно ли покупать на вывод крестьян. Из прений многие отзывались совершенным познанием предмета. «Конечно, — говорили иные, — это так, против этого и спору нет: земли в южных губерниях, точно, хороши и плодородны; но каково будет крестьянам Чичикова без воды? реки ведь нет никакой». — «Это бы еще ничего, что нет воды, это бы ничего, Степан Дмитриевич, но переселение-то ненадежная вещь. Дело известное, что мужик: на новой земле, да заняться еще хлебопашеством, да ничего у него нет, ни избы, ни двора, — убежит, как дважды два, навострит так лыжи, что и следа не отыщешь». — «Нет, Алексей Иванович, позвольте, позвольте, я не согласен с тем, что вы говорите, что мужик Чичикова убежит. Русский человек способен ко всему и привыкает ко всякому климату. Пошли его хоть в Камчатку, да дай только теплые рукавицы, он похлопает руками, топор в руки, и пошел рубить себе новую избу». — «Но, Иван Григорьевич, ты упустил из виду важное дело: ты не спросил еще, каков мужик у Чичикова. Позабыл то, что ведь хорошего человека не продаст помещик; я готов голову положить, если мужик Чичикова не вор и не пьяница в последней степени, праздношатайка и буйного поведения». — «Так, так, на это я согласен, это правда, никто не продаст хороших людей, и мужики Чичикова пьяницы, но нужно принять во внимание, что вот тут-то и есть мораль, тут-то и заключена мораль: они теперь негодяи, а, переселившись на новую землю, вдруг могут сделаться отличными подданными. Уж было немало таких примеров: просто в мире, да и по истории тоже». — «Никогда, никогда, — говорил управляющий казенными фабриками, — поверьте, никогда это не может быть. Ибо у крестьян Чичикова будут теперь два сильные врага. Первый враг есть близость губерний малороссийских, где, как известно, свободная продажа вина. Я вас уверяю: в две недели они изопьются и будут стельки. Другой враг есть уже самая привычка к бродяжнической жизни, которая необходимо приобретется крестьянами во время переселения. Нужно разве, чтобы они вечно были перед глазами Чичикова и чтоб он держал их в ежовых рукавицах, гонял бы их за всякий вздор, да и не то чтобы полагаясь на другого, а чтобы сам таки лично, где следует, дал бы и зуботычину и подзатыльника». — «Зачем же Чичикову возиться самому и давать подзатыльники, он может найти и управителя». — «Да, найдете управителя: все мошенники!» — «Мошенники потому, что господа не занимаются делом». — «Это правда, — подхватили многие. — Знай господин сам хотя сколько-нибудь толку в хозяйстве да умей различать людей — у него будет всегда хороший управитель». Но управляющий сказал, что меньше как за пять тысяч нельзя найти хорошего управителя. Но председатель сказал, что можно и за три тысячи сыскать. Но управляющий сказал: «Где же вы его сыщите? разве у себя в носу?» Но председатель сказал: «Нет, не в носу, а в здешнем же уезде, именно: Петр Петрович Самойлов: вот управитель, какой нужен для мужиков Чичикова!» Многие сильно входили в положение Чичикова, и трудность переселения такого огромного количества крестьян их чрезвычайно устрашала; стали сильно опасаться, чтобы не произошло даже бунта между таким беспокойным народом, каковы крестьяне Чичикова. На это полицеймейстер заметил, что бунта нечего опасаться, что в отвращение его существует власть капитана-исправника, что капитан-исправник хоть сам и не езди, а пошли только на место себя один картуз свой, то один этот картуз погонит крестьян до самого места их жительства. Многие предложили свои мнения насчет того, как искоренить буйный дух, обуревавший крестьян Чичикова. Мнения были всякого рода: были такие, которые уже чересчур отзывались военною жестокостью и строгостью, едва ли не излишнею; были, однако же, и такие, которые дышали кротостию. Почтмейстер заметил, что Чичикову предстоит священная обязанность, что он может сделаться среди своих крестьян некоторого рода отцом, по его выражению, ввести даже благодетельное просвещение, и при этом случае отозвался с большою похвалою об Ланкастеровой школе взаимного обученья.","Chichikov's purchases became the subject of conversation. Rumors, opinions, arguments about whether it is profitable to buy for the withdrawal of peasants began to spread in the city. From the debate, many responded with perfect knowledge of the subject. “Of course,” others said, “this is so, there is no doubt against it: the lands in the southern provinces are, for sure, good and fertile; but what will the peasants of Chichikov be like without water? there is no river."" “It would be nothing if there was no water, that would be nothing, Stepan Dmitrievich, but resettlement is an unreliable thing. It’s a well-known fact that a peasant: on a new land, but to do some more arable farming, but he has nothing, no hut, no yard, he will run away like twice two, sharpen his skis so that you won’t find a trace. - “No, Alexei Ivanovich, excuse me, excuse me, I don’t agree with what you say that Chichikov’s peasant will run away. A Russian person is capable of everything and gets used to any climate. Send him even to Kamchatka, but give only warm mittens, he will clap his hands, an ax in his hands, and went to cut himself a new hut. “But, Ivan Grigoryevich, you have overlooked an important matter: you have not yet asked what kind of peasant Chichikov is. I forgot that, after all, a landowner will not sell a good person; I am ready to lay down my head if the peasant Chichikov is not a thief and not a drunkard in the last degree, a idler and violent behavior. - “So, so, I agree to this, it’s true, no one will sell good people, and Chichikov’s peasants are drunkards, but you need to take into account that this is where morality lies, this is where morality lies: they are now scoundrels , and, having moved to a new land, they can suddenly become excellent subjects. There have already been many such examples: just in the world, and in history too. “Never, never,” said the manager of state-owned factories, “believe me, it can never be. For the peasants of Chichikov will now have two strong enemies. The first enemy is the proximity of the provinces of Little Russia, where, as you know, the free sale of wine. I assure you: in two weeks they will get drunk and there will be insoles. The other enemy is the very habit of wandering, which the peasants must acquire during their resettlement. Is it really necessary that they be always before Chichikov’s eyes and that he keep them in a tight grip, drive them away for any nonsense, and not only relying on another, but so that he personally, where appropriate, would give both a poke and a slap on the head "". “Why should Chichikov bother himself and give cuffs to the back of the head, he can also find a steward.” - ""Yes, you will find a steward: all swindlers!"" ""Scammers because the gentlemen don't do business."" ""It's true,"" said many. “If the master himself knows at least some sense in the economy and knows how to distinguish between people, he will always have a good steward.” But the steward said that it was impossible to find a good steward for less than five thousand. But the chairman said that you can find it for three thousand. But the manager said, “Where are you going to look for him? Is it in your nose? But the chairman said: “No, not in the nose, but in the local district, namely: Pyotr Petrovich Samoilov: this is the steward that Chichikov’s peasants need!” Many strongly entered into the position of Chichikov, and the difficulty of resettling such a huge number of peasants extremely frightened them; they began to fear very much that there would not even be a revolt between such a restless people as the peasants of Chichikov. To this, the police chief remarked that there was nothing to fear from a riot, that the power of the police captain existed to avert it, that even though the police captain did not go himself, they only sent one cap to their place, then this cap alone would drive the peasants to their very place. residence. Many offered their opinions on how to eradicate the violent spirit that overwhelmed the peasants of Chichikov. There were all sorts of opinions: there were those that already reeked too much of military cruelty and severity, almost superfluous; there were, however, those who breathed meekness. The postmaster noticed that Chichikov was faced with a sacred duty, that he could become a kind of father among his peasants, in his words, introduce even beneficent enlightenment, and on this occasion spoke with great praise of the Lancaster school of mutual education.","Tchitchikov’s purchases became the subject of conversation. Discussions took place in the town, views and opinions were expressed as to whether purchasing serfs for removal to another district were a profitable undertaking. From the controversy it appeared that many possessed a thorough understanding of the subject. “Of course it’s all right,” said some people, “there is no disputing it: the land in the southern provinces is undoubtedly good and fertile, but how are Tchitchikov’s peasants going to get on without water? You know there is no river.” “That wouldn’t matter, there being no water; that wouldn’t matter, Stepan Dmitryevitch; but transporting peasants is a risky business. We all know what the peasant is; put down on fresh land and set to till it, and with nothing for him, no hut, no firewood—why he’d run away as sure as twice two makes four, he’d take to his heels and leave no trace behind him.” “No, Alexey Ivanovitch, excuse me, I don’t agree with what you say that Tchitchikov’s peasants will run away. The Russian is capable of tackling anything, and can stand any climate. Send him to Kam chatkacf and just give him warm gloves, he’ll clap his hands together, pick up his axe and go off to hew logs for his new hut.” “But, Ivan Grigoryevitch, you have lost sight of one important point; you haven’t asked yourself what sort of peasants Tchitchikov’s are, you have forgotten that a good man is never sold by his master. I’ll stake my head that Tchitchikov’s peasants are thieves, hopeless drunkards, sluggards and of unruly behaviour.” “To be sure, to be sure, I quite agree, that’s true, no one will sell good serfs, and Tchitchikov’s peasants are drunkards, but you must take into consideration that there is a moral point involved, that it is a moral question; they are good-for-nothing fellows now but, settled on new land, they may become excellent serfs. There are many such instances in both daily life and history.“ “Never, never,” said the superintendent of the government factories, “believe me, that can never be, for Tchitchikov ’s peasants will have two terrible foes to face. The first is the proximity of the provinces of Little Russia,cg where as you all know there is no control of the Liquor Trade. I assure you within a fortnight they will all be as drunk as cob blers. The other danger arises from their inevitably growing used to a wandering life during their migration. They will have to be constantly before Tchitchikov’s eyes, and he will have to keep a very tight hold over them, punish them for every trifle, and it will be no good for him to rely on any one else, he must give them a punch in the face or a bang on the head when necessary with his own hands.” “Why should Tchitchikov have to bother and to knock them about himself? He may get a steward.” “Well, you get him a steward: they are all rogues!” “They are rogues because the masters don’t go into things themselves.” “That’s true,” several persons assented. “If the master has some notion of management himself and is a judge of character, he always gets a good steward.” But the superintendent of the factories said that you couldn’t get a good steward for less than five thousand roubles. Then the president maintained that you could find one for three thousand. But the superintendent protested: “Where are you going to find him, he is not just under your nose?” And the president said: “No, not under my nose, but in this district; I mean Pyotr Petrovitch Samoylov; he is the steward Tchitchikov’s peasants need!” Many threw themselves warmly into Tchitchikov’s position, and the difficulty of transporting so vast a number of peasants alarmed them extremely; they began to be greatly apprehensive of an actual mutiny arising among peasants so unruly as Tchitchikov’s. To this the police-master observed that there was no need to be afraid of a mutiny, that the authority of the police-captain himself need not go, that if he merely sent his cap, the sight of the cap would be enough to take the peasants all the way to their new home. Many persons offered suggestions for eradicating the mutinous spirit agitating Tchitchikov’s peasants. The suggestions were of various kinds. There were some which had a strong flavour of military harshness and even severity, though there were others distinguished by their mildness. The post-master observed that Tchitchikov had a sacred duty before him, that he might become, as he expressed it, something like a father to his peasants, that he might carry out the philanthropic work of enlightenment, and incidentally, he referred with approval to the Lancastrian system of education.ch","It was not long before Chichikov’s purchases had become the talk of the town; and various were the opinions expressed as to whether or not it was expedient to procure peasants for transferment. Indeed such was the interest taken by certain citizens in the matter that they advised the purchaser to provide himself and his convoy with an escort, in order to ensure their safe arrival at the appointed destination; but though Chichikov thanked the donors of this advice for the same, and declared that he should be very glad, in case of need, to avail himself of it, he declared also that there was no real need for an escort, seeing that the peasants whom he had purchased were exceptionally peace-loving folk, and that, being themselves consenting parties to the transferment, they would undoubtedly prove in every way tractable.","Chichikov’s purchases became a subject of conversation. Gossip went around town, opinions, discussions of whether it was profitable to buy peasants for resettlement. In the debate, many distinguished themselves by their perfect knowledge of the subject. “Of course,” said some, “it’s so, there’s no arguing against it : the land in the southern provinces is good and fertile; but what will Chichikov’s peasants do without water? There’s no river at all.” “That would still be nothing, that there’s no water, that would be nothing, Stepan Dmitrievich, but resettlement is an unreliable thing. We all know the muzhik: on new land, and he has to start farming it, and he’s got nothing, neither cottage nor yard—he’ll run away sure as two times two, walk his chalks and leave no trace behind.” “No, Alexei Ivanovich, excuse me, excuse me, I don’t agree with what you’re saying, that Chichikov’s muzhiks will run away. The Russian man is apt for anything and can get used to any climate. Send him all the way to Kamchatka, give him just a pair of warm mittens, and he’ll clap his hands, pick up his axe, and off he goes building himself a new cottage.” “But, Ivan Grigorievich, you’ve lost sight of an important thing: you haven’t asked yet what sort of muzhiks Chichikov’s are. You’ve forgotten that a landowner will never sell a good man; I’m ready to bet my head that Chichikov’s muzhiks are thieves and drunkards to the last degree, idle loafers and of riotous behavior.” “Yes, yes, I agree with that, it’s true, no one’s going to sell good people, and Chichikov’s muzhiks are drunkards, but you must take into consideration that it is here that we find the moral, here the moral lies: they are scoundrels now, but resettled on new land they may suddenly become excellent subjects. There have been not a few examples of it, simply in the world, and from history as well.” “Never, never,” the superintendent of the government factories said, “believe me, that can never be. For Chichikov’s peasants will now have two powerful enemies. The first enemy is the proximity of the provinces of Little Russia, where, as everyone knows, drink is sold freely. I assure you: in two weeks they’ll be liquored up and thoroughly pie-eyed. The other enemy is the habit of the vagabond life itself, acquired of necessity during their relocation. They would have to be eternally before Chichikov’s eyes, and he would have to keep them on a short tether, come down hard on them for every trifle, and, relying on no one save himself in person, give them a clout or a cuff when it’s called for.” “Why should Chichikov bother cuffing them himself? He can find a steward.” “Oh, yes, go find a steward: they’re all crooks.” “They’re crooks because the masters don’t concern themselves with things.” “That’s true,” many picked up. “If the master himself knew at least something about management, and was discerning of people, he would always have a good steward.” But the superintendent said one could not find a good steward for less than five thousand. But the magistrate said it was possible to find one for as little as three thousand. But the superintendent said: “Where are you going to find him, unless it’s up your own nose?” But the magistrate said: “No, not up my nose, but right in our district—namely: Pyotr Petrovich Samoilov: there’s the kind of steward needed for Chichikov’s muzhiks!” Many entered earnestly into Chichikov’s predicament, and the difficulty of relocating such an enormous number of peasants awed them exceedingly; there was great fear that a riot might even break out among such restless folk as Chichikov’s peasants. To this the police chief observed that there was no need to fear a riot, that the power of the district captain of police was there to avert it, that the captain of police had no need to go himself, but in his place could merely send his peaked cap, and this peaked cap alone would drive the peasants all the way to their place of settlement. Many offered opinions as to how to eradicate the riotous spirit that possessed Chichikov’s peasants. These opinions were of various sorts: there were some that smacked excessively of military cruelty and severity, almost to superfluousness; there were also such, however, as breathed of mildness. The postmaster observed that Chichikov was faced with a sacred duty, that he could become something like a father among his peasants, as he put it, even introducing beneficent enlightenment, and he took the occasion to refer with much praise to the Lancastrian school of mutual education.34","Chichikov’s purchases became the subject of much talk. Surmises, opinions, and discussions as to whether it was profitable to buy peasants for resettlement now absorbed the whole town. Many of the disputants evinced a thorough knowledge of the subject. “Of course,” some maintained, “that is very true; there’s no arguing against it— lands in the southern provinces are undeniably good and fertile; but how will things be for Chichikov’s serfs without any water? There’s no river there at all.” “The lack of water wouldn’t matter; it wouldn’t matter in the least, Stepan Dmitrievich, if it weren’t that resettlement is an unreliable thing all around. Everybody knows what the muzhik is: he’ll be on new land, and he’ll have to work that land with nary a thing —he won’t have a hut nor a yard. Well, he’ll run off as sure as two times two, he’ll make himself so scarce you’ll find neither hide nor hair of him.” “No, hold on, hold on, Aleksei Ivanovich, I don’t agree with what you’re saying, that Chichikov’s muzhiks will run off. The Russian can adapt himself to everything and become used to every climate. You can send him even to Kamchatka— the only thing you’ll have to supply him with will be mittens; then he’ll slap his hands together, take an ax in them, and be off to chop down timber for a new hut.” “But, Ivan Grigorievich, you’ve left out one important factor: you haven’t yet asked what sort of muzhik Chichikov has. Have you forgotten that no landowner will sell a good serf? I’m ready to lay my head on the block if the kind of muzhik Chichikov has isn’t a thief and the most abandoned of drunkards, an idle vagabond and of violent conduct.” “ Just so, just so; I agree with that; it’s true no one will sell good serfs and that Chichikov’s serfs are drunkards; but it must be taken into consideration that there’s a moral here, and that’s precisely what the moral consists of: they’re good-for-nothings now but, having resettled in a new land, they may become excellent and obedient people in no time at all. There have already been not a few such examples, not only in daily life, but throughout history as well.” “Never, never!” maintained the overseer of the government factories. “Believe me, such a thing can never be, since Chichikov’s peasants will have two powerful enemies to contend against. Their first enemy is the proximity of the provinces in Little Russia where, as you know, spirits are freely sold.1 I assure you that within two weeks they’ll drink themselves into the blind staggers. The other enemy is none other than wanderlust, which will be inevitably acquired by the peasants during the process of their resettlement. If these are to be guarded against, it will be necessary to keep them perpetually under Chichikov’s very eyes, and he’ll have to treat them with an iron hand and bear down on them hard for every offense, no matter how trifling, and he won’t be able to rely upon anybody else to do it for him, either, but should the occasion call for it, he must be able himself, with his own two fists, to ram the muzhik’s teeth down his throat or plant a good, solid clout on the back of his neck or both.” “But why should Chichikov be bothered himself and have to clout the backs of their necks? He can find an overseer, can’t he?” “Oh, yes, you’ll find an overseer! They’re all cheating rogues!” “They’re cheating rogues because the masters don’t attend to their business!” “That’s the truth!” many chimed in. “If the master himself knows anything at all about what’s what in running an estate and if he’s any kind of a judge of character, he’ll always have a good overseer.” But the Factory Manager said that you couldn’t find a good overseer for less than five thousand. The Chairman, however, said that you could dig one up for even three thousand. Whereupon the Factory Manager said: “Where will you dig him up, then? In your nose, maybe?” “No,” said the Chairman, “not in my nose but in this very district—Petr Petrovich Samoilov, to be precise, there’s the overseer you need for Chichikov’s muzhiks!” Many felt strongly about Chichikov’s situation, and the difficulty of resettling such an enormous number of peasants frightened them exceedingly: they even began to be greatly apprehensive lest an actual uprising occur among such unruly folk as Chichikov’s peasants. In answer to this the Chief of Police assured them that there was no need to apprehend an uprising; that for the averting thereof there existed the power of the Captain of the Rural Police; that, if, instead of coming himself, the Captain of the Rural Police were to send merely the cap of his uniform, that cap alone would drive the peasants to the very place of their resettlement. Many offered their opinions on how to root out the spirit of revolt that had swept like a storm over these peasants of Chichikov’s. These opinions were of every sort: there were such as reeked far too much of military harshness, and of a severity that was all but excessive; there were, however, such opinions as were inspired with gentleness. The Postmaster remarked that a sacred obligation lay ahead of Chichikov, that he could become a father, of a sort, to his peasants; as he expressed it, Chichikov might even bring about benevolent enlightenment, and in connection with this, he commented with praise on the Lancasterian method of mutual education.2"
"Чичиков с радостью воспользовался предложеньем. Пролетки были поданы, и он поехал тот же час к полковнику, который изумил его так, как еще никогда ему не случалось изумляться. Все было у полковника необыкновенно. Вся деревня была вразброску: постройки, перестройки, кучи извести, кирпичу и бревен по всем улицам. Выстроены были какие-то дома вроде присутственных мест. На одном было написано золотыми буквами: «Депо земледельческих орудий», на другом: «Главная счетная экспедиция», на третьем: «Комитет сельских дел»; «Школа нормального просвещенья поселян», — словом, черт знает, чего не было! Он думал, не въехал ли в губернский город. Сам полковник был какой-то чопорный. Лицо какое-то чинное в виде треугольника. Бакенбарды по щекам его были протянуты в струнку; волосы, прическа, нос, губы, подбородок — все как бы лежало дотоле под прессом. Начал он говорить, как бы и дельный человек. С первых начал начал он ему жаловаться на необразованность окружающих помещиков, на великие труды, которые ему предстоят. Принял он Чичикова отменно ласково и радушно, ввел его совершенно в доверенность и рассказал с самоуслажденьем, скольких и скольких стоило ему трудов возвесть именье до нынешнего благосостояния: как трудно было дать понять простому мужику, что есть высшие побуждения, которые доставляют человеку просвещенная роскошь, искусство и художества: сколько нужно было бороться с невежеством русского мужика, чтобы одеть его в немецкие штаны и заставить почувствовать, хотя сколько-нибудь, высшее Достоинство человека; что баб, несмотря на все усилия, он до сих пор не мог заставить надеть корсет, тогда как в Германии, где он стоял с полком в 14-м году, дочь мельника умела играть даже на фортепиано, говорила по-французски и делала книксен. С соболезнованием рассказывал он, как велика необразованность соседей помещиков; как мало думают они о своих подвластных; как они даже смеялись, когда он старался изъяснить, как необходимо для хозяйства устроенье письменной конторы, контор комиссии и даже комитетов, чтобы тем предохранить всякие кражи и всякая вещь была бы известна, чтобы писарь, управитель и бухгалтер образовались бы не как-нибудь, но оканчивали бы университетское воспитанье; как, несмотря на все убеждения, он не мог убедить помещиков в том, что какая бы выгода была их имениям, если бы каждый крестьянин был воспитан так, чтобы, идя за плугом, мог читать в то же время книгу о громовых отводах.","Chichikov gladly took advantage of the offer. The cabs were brought in, and he went the same hour to the colonel, who amazed him in a way that he had never been surprised before. Everything about the colonel was extraordinary. The whole village was scattered: buildings, rebuildings, heaps of lime, bricks and logs along all the streets. Some houses were built like government offices. On one was written in gold letters: ""Depot of agricultural implements"", on the other: ""Main accounting expedition"", on the third: ""Committee of rural affairs""; “The school of normal education for the villagers,” in a word, the devil knows what was not! He wondered if he had entered the provincial town. The colonel himself was somewhat stiff. The face is some kind of decorous in the form of a triangle. His whiskers were stretched straight down his cheeks; hair, hairstyle, nose, lips, chin—everything, as it were, had hitherto been under pressure. He began to speak, as if he were a practical person. From the first beginnings, he began to complain to him about the lack of education of the surrounding landowners, about the great work that lay ahead of him. He received Chichikov with excellent tenderness and cordiality, introduced him completely into a power of attorney and told with self-delight how much and how much labor it cost him to raise the estate to its current prosperity: how difficult it was to make it clear to a simple peasant that there are higher motives that enlightened luxury, art bring to a person and art: how much it was necessary to struggle with the ignorance of the Russian peasant in order to dress him in German trousers and make him feel, at least to some extent, the highest Dignity of man; that, despite all his efforts, he still could not force a woman to put on a corset, while in Germany, where he stood with the regiment in the 14th year, the miller's daughter could even play the piano, spoke French and did curtsy. With condolences, he told how ignorant the neighbors of the landowners were; how little they think of their subjects; how they even laughed when he tried to explain how necessary it was for the economy to set up a writing office, commission offices, and even committees, in order to prevent all sorts of thefts and every thing would be known, so that a clerk, manager and accountant would be formed not somehow, but would complete university education; how, in spite of all his convictions, he could not convince the landlords that what would be the benefit to their estates if every peasant was brought up so that, walking behind a plow, he could at the same time read a book about lightning rods.","Tchitchikov gladly availed himself of this suggestion. The droshky was brought round, and he drove off at once to see the colonel, who amazed him more than any one he had seen before. Everything at the colonel’s was unusual. The whole village was upside down; building, rebuilding, heaps of mortar, bricks, and beams were about all the streets. Some houses were planned like government buildings. On one was inscribed in golden letters: “Depot for Agricultural Implements,” on another, “Principal Counting House,” on the third, “Committee of Rural Affairs,” “School of Normal Education for Villagers”; in fact there was no telling what there was. He wondered whether he had not driven into the district town. The colonel himself was a rather stiff individual. His face was somewhat prim-looking and of the shape of a triangle. The whiskers were drawn stiffly down each cheek, his hair, his nose, his lip and his chin all looked as though they had been kept under a press. He began talking like a sensible man. From the first word he began complaining of the lack of culture among the surrounding landowners, of the great difficulties that lay before him. He received Tchitchikov cordially and affably, and quite took him into his confidence, describing with self-complacency what immense labour it had cost him to bring his estate into its present prosperous condition: how difficult it was to make the simple peasant understand that there are higher pleasures which enlightened luxury provides for man, that there is such a thing as art; how necessary it was to struggle with the ignorance of the Russian peasant, to dress him in German breeches and to make him at least to some extent sensible of the higher dignity of man; that in spite of all his efforts he had, so far, been unable to make the peasant women put on corsets, while in Germany, where he had stayed with his regiment in 1814, a miller’s daughter could even play on the piano, speak French and make a curtsey. He deplored the terrible lack of culture of the neighbouring landowners, telling him how little they thought about their subjects; how they even laughed when he tried to explain how necessary for the management of an estate it was to establish a secretary’s office, counting houses and even committees, so as to prevent all sorts of stealing, and so that everything should be known; that the clerk, the steward and the book-keeper ought not to be educated just anyhow, but ought to complete their studies at the university, that in spite of all his persuasions he could not convince the landowners of the benefit it would be to their estates if every peasant were so well educated that he could read a treatise on lightning conductors while following the plough.","cried Chichikov, and with that he seized his cap. Half an hour’s drive sufficed to bring him to the Colonel’s establishment. The village attached to the manor was in a state of utter confusion, since in every direction building and repairing operations were in progress, and the alleys were choked with heaps of lime, bricks, and beams of wood. Also, some of the huts were arranged to resemble offices, and superscribed in gilt letters “Depot for Agricultural Implements,” “Chief Office of Accounts,” “Estate Works Committee,” “Normal School for the Education of Colonists,” and so forth. Chichikov found the Colonel posted behind a desk and holding a pen between his teeth. Without an instant’s delay the master of the establishment—who seemed a kindly, approachable man, and accorded to his visitor a very civil welcome—plunged into a recital of the labour which it had cost him to bring the property to its present condition of affluence. Then he went on to lament the fact that he could not make his peasantry understand the incentives to labour which the riches of science and art provide; for instance, he had failed to induce his female serfs to wear corsets, whereas in Germany, where he had resided for fourteen years, every humble miller’s daughter could play the piano. None the less, he said, he meant to peg away until every peasant on the estate should, as he walked behind the plough, indulge in a regular course of reading Franklin’s Notes on Electricity, Virgil’s Georgics, or some work on the chemical properties of soil.","Chichikov gladly took advantage of the suggestion. The droshky was brought, and he drove off at once to see the colonel, who amazed him as he had never been amazed before. Everything at his place was extraordinary. The village was scattered all over: construction sites, reconstruction sites, piles of lime, brick, and logs everywhere in the streets. There were some houses built that looked like institutions. On one there was written in gold letters: FARM IMPLEMENT DEPOT, on another: MAIN ACCOUNTING OFFICE, on a third: VILLAGE AFFAIRS COMMITEE; SCHOOL OF NORMAL EDUCATION OF SETTLERS—in short , devil knows what was not there! He thought he might have entered a provincial capital. The colonel himself was somehow stiff. His face was somehow formal, shaped like a triangle. His side-whiskers stretched in a line down his cheeks; his hair, hairstyling, nose, lips, chin—everything was as if it had just been taken from a press. He began speaking as if he were a sensible man. From the very beginning he began to complain of the lack of learning among the surrounding landowners, of the great labors that lay ahead of him. He received Chichikov with the utmost kindness and cordiality, took him entirely into his confidence, and with self-delight told him what labor, oh, what labor it had cost him to raise his estate to its present prosperity; how hard it was to make a simple muzhik understand the lofty impulses that enlightened luxury and the fine arts give a man; how necessary it was to combat the Russian muzhik’s ignorance, so as to get him to dress in German trousers and make him feel, at least to some extent, man’s lofty dignity; that, despite all his efforts, he had so far been unable to make the peasant women put on corsets, whereas in Germany, where his regiment had been stationed in the year ’fourteen, a miller’s daughter could even play the piano, speak French, and curtsy. Regretfully, he told how great was the lack of learning among the neighboring landowners; how little they thought of their subjects; how they even laughed when he tried to explain how necessary it was for good management to set up a record office, commission offices, and even committees, so as to prevent all theft, so that every object would be known, so that the scrivener, the steward, and the bookkeeper would not be just educated somehow, but finish their studies at the university; how, despite all persuasions, he was unable to convince the landowners of how profitable it would be for their estates if every peasant were so well educated that, while following the plough, he could at the same time read a book about lightning rods.",

I must have it if I die for it.”","What a secretive fellow you are! My only object in having come to see you is to lend you a helping hand in the matter. Look here.

"Оба приятеля очень крепко поцеловались, и Манилов увел своего гостя в комнату. Хотя время, в продолжение которого они будут проходить сени, переднюю и столовую, несколько коротковато, но попробуем, не успеем ли как-нибудь им воспользоваться и сказать кое-что о хозяине дома. Но тут автор должен признаться, что подобное предприятие очень трудно. Гораздо легче изображать характеры большого размера: там просто бросай краски со всей руки на полотно, черные палящие глаза, нависшие брови, перерезанный морщиною лоб, перекинутый через плечо черный или алый, как огонь, плащ — и портрет готов; но вот эти все господа, которых много на свете, которые с вида очень похожи между собою, а между тем как приглядишься, увидишь много самых неуловимых особенностей, — эти господа страшно трудны для портретов. Тут придется сильно напрягать внимание, пока заставишь перед собою выступить все тонкие, почти невидимые черты, и вообще далеко придется углублять уже изощренный в науке выпытывания взгляд.","Both friends kissed very warmly, and Manilov led his guest into the room. Although the time during which they will pass through the entrance hall, the hallway and the dining room is somewhat short, we will try to see if we can somehow use it and say something about the owner of the house. But here the author must confess that such an undertaking is very difficult. It is much easier to depict characters of a large size: there, just throw paint with all your hand onto the canvas, black scorching eyes, hanging eyebrows, a forehead cut with a wrinkle, a black or scarlet cloak thrown over your shoulder - and the portrait is ready; but all these gentlemen, of whom there are many in the world, who look very similar to each other, but meanwhile, if you look closely, you will see many of the most elusive features - these gentlemen are terribly difficult for portraits. Here you will have to strain your attention strongly until you force all the subtle, almost invisible features to stand out before you, and in general you will have to deepen your gaze, already sophisticated in the science of probing.","The friends kissed each other very warmly and Manilov led his visitor indoors. Though the time spent by them in passing through the vestibule, the hall, and the dining-room will be somewhat brief, yet we must snatch the opportunity to say a few words about the master of the house. But at this point the author must confess that the task is a very difficult one. It is much easier to describe characters on a grander scale: then you simply have to throw the colour by hand fuls on the canvas—black, glowing eyes, overhanging brows, a forehead lined by care, a black or fiery crimson cloak flung over the shoulder, and the portrait is complete. But all the gentlemen (of whom there are so many in the world) who look so very much alike and yet, when you inspect them more closely, have many extremely elusive peculiarities, are fearfully difficult to describe. One has to strain one’s attention to the utmost to make all the delicate almost indiscernible traits stand out, and altogether one needs to look deeply with an eye sharpened by long practice in the art.","The two friends exchanged hearty embraces, and Manilov then conducted his guest to the drawing-room. During the brief time that they are traversing the hall, the anteroom, and the dining-room, let me try to say something concerning the master of the house. But such an undertaking bristles with difficulties—it promises to be a far less easy task than the depicting of some outstanding personality which calls but for a wholesale dashing of colours upon the canvas—the colours of a pair of dark, burning eyes, a pair of dark, beetling brows, a forehead seamed with wrinkles, a black, or a fiery-red, cloak thrown backwards over the shoulder, and so forth, and so forth. Yet, so numerous are Russian serf owners that, though careful scrutiny reveals to one’s sight a quantity of outre peculiarities, they are, as a class, exceedingly difficult to portray, and one needs to strain one’s faculties to the utmost before it becomes possible to pick out their variously subtle, their almost invisible, features. In short, one needs, before doing this, to carry out a prolonged probing with the aid of an insight sharpened in the acute school of research.","The two friends kissed very warmly, and Manilov led his guest inside. Though the time it will take them to pass through the entryway, the front hall, and the dining room is somewhat shortish, let us try and see if we cannot somehow make use of it to say something about the master of the house. But here the author must confess that this undertaking is a very difficult one. It is much easier to portray large-size characters: just whirl your arm and fling paint on the canvas, dark scorching eyes, beetling brows, a furrow-creased forehead, a cloak, black or fiery scarlet, thrown over one shoulder—and the portrait is done; but now all these gentlemen, who are so many in the world, who resemble each other so much, yet, once you look closer, you see many most elusive peculiarities—these gentlemen are terribly difficult to portray. Here one must strain one’s attention greatly, until all the fine, almost invisible features are made to stand out before one, and generally one must further deepen one’s gaze, already experienced in the science of elicitation.","The two friends kissed each other more heartily and Manilov led his guest inside. Although the time during which they will be passing through the entry, the anteroom, and the dining room is somewhat brief, nevertheless let us see if we can’t somehow utilize it to say a thing or two about the master of the house. But at this point the author must confess that such an undertaking is a very difficult one. It is considerably easier to depict characters that are on a grand scale: there you just dash the pigments onto the canvas with a full sweep—black, blazing orbs, beetling eyebrows, a forehead furrowed by a deep crease, a black cape (or one as scarlet as fire) tossed over the shoulders—and your portrait is done; but you take all these gentlemen now, of whom there are so many in this world, who are so very much like one another in appearance, and yet at the same time, when you take a close look will be seen to have many exceedingly elusive peculiarities —why, these gentlemen are dreadfully difficult to do in portraits. Here you will have to strain your observation hard, until you compel all the subtle, almost imperceptible traits to emerge before you, and in general, you will have to force your eye, already well exercised in the science of prying, to penetrate as deeply as possible."

"— Поприще службы моей, — сказал Чичиков, садясь в кресла не в середине, но наискось, и ухватившись рукою за ручку кресел, — началось в казенной палате, ваше превосходительство; дальнейшее же теченье оной продолжал в разных местах: был и в надворном суде, и в комиссии построения, и в таможне. Жизнь мою можно уподобить судну среди волн, ваше превосходительство. На терпенье, можно сказать, вырос, терпеньем воспоен, терпеньем спеленат, и сам, так сказать, не что другое, как одно терпенье. А уж сколько претерпел от врагов, так ни слова, ни краски не сумеют передать. Теперь же, на вечере, так сказать, жизни своей, ищу уголка, где бы провесть остаток дней. Приостановился же покуда у близкого соседа вашего превосходительства…","“The field of my service,” said Chichikov, sitting down in an armchair not in the middle, but obliquely, and grasping the arm of the chair with his hand, “began in the Treasury, Your Excellency; the further course of this continued in different places: he was in the court court, and in the construction commission, and in customs. My life can be likened to a ship among the waves, Your Excellency. One might say, he has grown up with patience, he has been trained in patience, swaddled with patience, and he himself, so to speak, is nothing but patience alone. And how much he suffered from enemies, so neither words nor colors will be able to convey. Now, at the evening, so to speak, of my life, I am looking for a corner where to spend the rest of my days. I paused for the time being at Your Excellency's close neighbor...","“My career in the service,” said Tchitchikov, sitting down, not in the middle of the chair but on the edge of it, with one hand holding on to the arm, “began in the Treasury, your Excellency; I passed the later years of it in various departments: I have been in the Imperial Court department, and on the Buildings Committee and in the Customs. My life may be compared to a vessel in mid-ocean, your Excellency. In suffering, I may say, I was reared, in suffering I was fostered, in suffering I was swaddled and I am, so to say, nothing but an embodiment of suffering. And what I have endured at the hands of my enemies no words could depict. Now in the evening, so to speak, of my life I am seeking a nook in which to spend the remnant of my days. I am staying for the time with a near neighbour of yours, your Excellency ...”","“Of my service,” said Chichikov, depositing his form, not exactly in the centre of the chair, but rather on one side of it, and resting a hand upon one of its arms, “—of my service the scene was laid, in the first instance, in the Treasury; while its further course bore me successively into the employ of the Public Buildings Commission, of the Customs Board, and of other Government Offices. But, throughout, my life has resembled a barque tossed on the crests of perfidious billows. In suffering I have been swathed and wrapped until I have come to be, as it were, suffering personified; while of the extent to which my life has been sought by foes, no words, no colouring, no (if I may so express it?) painter’s brush could ever convey to you an adequate idea. And now, at length, in my declining years, I am seeking a corner in which to eke out the remainder of my miserable existence, while at the present moment I am enjoying the hospitality of a neighbour of your acquaintance.”","“My career in the service,” said Chichikov, sitting down not in the center of the armchair, but obliquely, and grasping the armrest with his hand, “began in the treasury department, Your Excellency; and the further course of same was pursued in various places: I was in the civil courts, on a building commission, and in customs. My life may be likened to a ship amidst the waves, Your Excellency. I grew up, one might say, on patience, nursed by patience, swaddled by patience, and am myself, so to speak, nothing but patience. And how much I have suffered from enemies no words or colors can tell. And now, in the evening, so to speak, of my life, I am searching for a little corner in which to pass the rest of my days. And I am staying meanwhile with a near neighbor of Your Excellency’s …”",
"Там, в этой комнатке, так знакомой читателю, с дверью, заставленной комодом, и выглядывавшими иногда из углов тараканами, положение мыслей и духа его было так же неспокойно, как неспокойны те кресла, в которых он сидел. Неприятно, смутно было у него на сердце, какая-то тягостная пустота оставалась там. «Чтоб вас черт побрал всех, кто выдумал эти балы! — говорил он в сердцах. — Ну, чему сдуру обрадовались? В губернии неурожаи, дороговизна, так вот они за балы! Эк штука: разрядились в бабьи тряпки! Невидаль, что иная навертела на себя тысячу рублей! А ведь на счет же крестьянских оброков или, что еще хуже, на счет совести нашего брата. Ведь известно, зачем берешь взятку и покривишь душой: для того чтобы жене достать на шаль или на разные роброны, провал их возьми, как их называют. А из чего? чтобы не сказала какая-нибудь подстёга Сидоровна, что на почтмейстерше лучше было платье, да из-за нее бух тысячу рублей. Кричат: „Бал, бал, веселость!“ — просто дрянь бал, не в русском духе, не в русской натуре; черт знает что такое: взрослый, совершеннолетний вдруг выскочит весь в черном, общипанный, обтянутый, как чертик, и давай месить ногами. Иной даже, стоя в паре, переговаривает с другим об важном деле, а ногами в то же время, как козленок, вензеля направо и налево… Всё из обезьянства, всё из обезьянства! Что француз в сорок лет такой же ребенок, каким был и в пятнадцать, так вот давай же и мы! Нет, право… после всякого бала точно как будто какой грех сделал; и вспоминать даже о нем не хочется. В голове просто ничего, как после разговора с светским человеком: всего он наговорит, всего слегка коснется, все скажет, что понадергал из книжек, пестро, красно, а в голове хоть бы что-нибудь из того вынес, и видишь потом, как даже, разговор с простым купцом, знающим одно свое дело, но знающим его твердо и опытно, лучше всех этих побрякушек. Ну что из него выжмешь, из этого бала? Ну если бы, положим, какой-нибудь писатель вздумал описывать всю эту сцену так, как она есть? Ну и в книге, и там была бы она также бестолкова, как в натуре. Что она такое: нравственная ли, безнравственная ли? просто черт знает что такое! Плюнешь, да и книгу потом закроешь». Так отзывался неблагоприятно Чичиков о балах вообще; но, кажется, сюда вмешалась другая причина негодованья. Главная досада была не на бал, а на то, что случилось ему оборваться, что он вдруг показался пред всеми бог знает в каком виде, что сыграл какую-то странную, двусмысленную роль. Конечно, взглянувши оком благоразумного человека, он видел, что все это вздор, что глупое слово ничего не значит, особливо теперь, когда главное дело уже обделано как следует. Но странен человек: его огорчало сильно нерасположенье тех самых, которых он не уважал и насчет которых отзывался резко, понося их суетность и наряды. Это тем более было ему досадно, что, разобравши дело ясно, он видел, как причиной этого был отчасти сам. На себя, однако же, он не рассердился, и в том, конечно, был прав. Все мы имеем маленькую слабость немножко пощадить себя, а постараемся лучше приискать какого-нибудь ближнего, на ком бы выместить свою досаду, например на слуге, на чиновнике, нам подведомственном, который в пору подвернулся, на жене или, наконец, на стуле, который швырнется черт знает куда, к самым дверям, так что отлетит от него ручка и спинка: пусть, мол, его знает, что такое гнев. Так и Чичиков скоро нашел ближнего, который потащил на-плечах своих все, что только могла внушить ему досада. Ближний этот был Ноздрев, и нечего сказать, он был так отделан со всех боков и сторон, как разве только какой-нибудь плут староста или ямщик бывает отделан каким-нибудь езжалым, опытным капитаном, а иногда и генералом, который сверх многих выражений, сделавшихся классическими, прибавляет еще много неизвестных, которых изобретение принадлежит ему собственно. Вся родословная Ноздрева была разобрана, и многие из членов его фамилии в восходящей линии сильно потерпели.","There, in this little room, so familiar to the reader, with a door lined with a chest of drawers and sometimes cockroaches peeping out of the corners, the state of his thoughts and spirit was as restless as the chairs in which he sat were restless. Unpleasantly, vaguely was in his heart, some painful emptiness remained there. “Damn you all who invented these balls! he said in his heart. - Well, what foolishly rejoiced? In the province crop failures, high cost, so here they are for the balls! Ek thing: discharged into women's rags! It is not seen that another has turned a thousand rubles on herself! But at the expense of peasant dues, or, even worse, at the expense of our brother's conscience. After all, it is known why you take a bribe and pretend to be: in order to get your wife for a shawl or for various robrons, take them, as they are called. And from what? so that some instigator Sidorovna would not say that the postmaster had a better dress, but because of her, bang a thousand rubles. They shout: “Ball, ball, gaiety!” - just a rubbish ball, not in the Russian spirit, not in Russian nature; the devil knows what it is: an adult, an adult, suddenly jumps out all in black, plucked, covered like a devil, and let's knead with his feet. Some even, standing in a pair, are talking with another about an important matter, and at the same time, like a goat, with their feet, monograms to the right and left ... Everything from ape, everything from ape! That a Frenchman is the same child at forty as he was at fifteen, so come on! No, really ... after every ball, it’s as if he committed some kind of sin; and I don't even want to remember it. There is simply nothing in my head, as after a conversation with a secular person: he will say everything, touch everything slightly, everything will say that he pulled from books, motley, red, but in his head at least took something out of it, and then you see how even , a conversation with a simple merchant who knows one business, but who knows it firmly and experiencedly, is better than all these trinkets. Well, what can you squeeze out of it, from this ball? Well, if, let's say, some writer took it into his head to describe this whole scene as it is? Well, in the book, and there she would be as stupid as in kind. What is it: moral or immoral? just what the hell is that! You spit, and then you close the book. That is how Chichikov spoke unfavorably of balls in general; but another cause of indignation seems to intervene here. The main annoyance was not at the ball, but at the fact that he happened to break off, that he suddenly appeared before everyone in God knows what form, that he played some strange, ambiguous role. Of course, looking through the eyes of a prudent person, he saw that all this was nonsense, that a stupid word meant nothing, especially now that the main thing had already been done properly. But the man is strange: he was greatly distressed by the dislike of the very ones whom he did not respect and about whom he spoke sharply, vilifying their vanity and outfits. This was all the more annoying to him because, having examined the matter clearly, he saw how the cause of this was partly himself. However, he was not angry with himself, and in that, of course, he was right. We all have a small weakness to spare ourselves a little, but we will try better to find some neighbor on whom to take out our annoyance, for example, on a servant, on an official subordinate to us, who turned up at the right time, on his wife, or, finally, on a chair that the devil knows where, to the very doors, so that the handle and the back will fly off from him: let him, they say, know what anger is. So Chichikov soon found his neighbor, who dragged on his shoulders everything that could annoy him. This neighbor was Nozdryov, and there is nothing to say, he was so trimmed on all sides and sides, as only some rogue elder or coachman is trimmed by some experienced captain, and sometimes a general, who, beyond the many expressions that have been made classical, adds many more unknowns, of which the invention belongs to him. The entire genealogy of Nozdryov was sorted out, and many of the members of his family in the ascending line suffered greatly.","There in the little room so familiar to the reader, with the chest of drawers blocking up one door, and the cockroaches peering out of the corners, his mind and his soul were as comfortable as the easy-chair on which he was sitting. There was an unpleasant confused feeling in his heart; there was an oppressive emptiness in it. “Damnation take all those who arranged that ball!” he said to himself in anger. “What are they so pleased about in their foolishness? The crops have failed and there is dearth in the province, and they are all for balls! A fine business! they dress themselves up in their feminine rags! It’s a monstrous thing for a woman to waste a thousand roubles on her trappings! And of course it’s at the expense of the peasants’ earnings or what’s worse still, of the consciences of our dear friends. We all know why a man takes a bribe and overcomes his scruples: it’s to get his wife a shawl or robes of some sort, plague take them, whatever they are called! And what for? That some low woman shouldn’t say that the postmaster’s wife was better dressed, and bang goes a thousand roubles because of her. They cry out, ‘A ball, a ball! delightful!’ A ball’s a silly rubbishy thing, it’s not in the Russian spirit, nor true to the Russian nature; what the devil is one to make of it? A grown-up man, getting on in years, suddenly skips in, all in black, as trim and tight as a devil, and sets to working away with his legs. Even while they are standing in couples, a man will begin talking to another about something of importance, and all the while his legs will be capering to right and to left like a goat.... It is all apishness, apishness! Because a Frenchman is as childish at forty as he was fifteen, we must be the same! Yes, really, after every ball one feels as though one had committed a sin and does not like to think of it. One’s head is as empty as it is after talking to one of these society gentlemen. He talks about everything, touches lightly on everything, he says everything he has filched out of books brightly and picturesquely, but he hasn’t got anything of it in his head; and you see afterwards that a talk with a humble merchant who knows nothing but his own business but does know that thoroughly and by experience, is better than all these chatterboxes. Why, what do you get out of this ball? Come, suppose some writer were to take it into his head to describe all that scene just as it was. Why, it would be just as senseless in a book as it is in nature. What was it, moral or immoral? God knows what to make of it! You would simply spit and shut the book.” Such were Tchitchikov’s unfavourable criticisms of balls in general ; but I fancy that there was partly another reason for his indignation. His chief vexation was not with the ball, but with the fact that he had happened to come off rather badly at it, that he had been made to look like goodness knows what, that he had played a strange and ambiguous part of it. Of course, looking at it as a sensible man, he could see that it was all nonsense, that a foolish word is of no consequence, especially now when his chief business was successfully concluded. But—strange is man: he was deeply mortified at being in disfavour with the very people whom he did not respect, and whose vanity and love of dress he derided. This annoyed him all the more because when he analysed the matter clearly, he saw that he was to some extent himself to blame. He was not, however, angry with himself, and there, of course, he was quite right. We all have a little weakness for sparing ourselves, and we try to find some neighbour on whom to pour out our vexation, for instance, our servant, our subordinate at the office who turns up at the moment, our wife, or even a chair which is sent flying , goodness knows where, right against the door, so that its arms and back are broken—let it have a taste of one’s wrath, one feels. So Tchitchikov soon found some one on whose shoulders to throw everything his vexation suggested to him. This was Nozdyrov, and it is needless to say that he came in for a storm of abuse, for a storm of abuse such as is only poured on some rogue of a village elder or driver by some experienced captain on his travels, or even by a general who, to the many expressions that have become classical, adds others unfamiliar, for the invention of which he can claim the credit. All Nozdryov’s kith and kin came in for abuse, and many members of his family were severely dealt with.","In his little room, with its door of communication blocked with a wardrobe, his frame of mind remained as uncomfortable as the chair in which he was seated. His heart ached with a dull, unpleasant sensation, with a sort of oppressive emptiness. “The devil take those who first invented balls!” was his reflection. “Who derives any real pleasure from them? In this province there exist want and scarcity everywhere: yet folk go in for balls! How absurd, too, were those overdressed women! One of them must have had a thousand roubles on her back, and all acquired at the expense of the overtaxed peasant, or, worse still, at that of the conscience of her neighbour. Yes, we all know why bribes are accepted, and why men become crooked in soul. It is all done to provide wives —yes, may the pit swallow them up!—with fal-lals. And for what purpose? That some woman may not have to reproach her husband with the fact that, say, the Postmaster’s wife is wearing a better dress than she is—a dress which has cost a thousand roubles! ‘ Balls and gaiety, balls and gaiety’ is the constant cry. Yet what folly balls are! They do not consort with the Russian spirit and genius, and the devil only knows why we have them. A grown, middle-aged man—a man dressed in black, and looking as stiff as a poker—suddenly takes the floor and begins shuffling his feet about, while another man, even though conversing with a companion on important business, will, the while, keep capering to right and left like a billy-goat! Mimicry, sheer mimicry! The fact that the Frenchman is at forty precisely what he was at fifteen leads us to imagine that we too, forsooth, ought to be the same. No; a ball leaves one feeling that one has done a wrong thing—so much so that one does not care even to think of it. It also leaves one’s head perfectly empty, even as does the exertion of talking to a man of the world. A man of that kind chatters away, and touches lightly upon every conceivable subject, and talks in smooth, fluent phrases which he has culled from books without grazing their substance; whereas go and have a chat with a tradesman who knows at least ONE thing thoroughly, and through the medium of experience, and see whether his conversation will not be worth more than the prattle of a thousand chatterboxes. For what good does one get out of balls? Suppose that a competent writer were to describe such a scene exactly as it stands? Why, even in a book it would seem senseless, even as it certainly is in life. Are, therefore, such functions right or wrong? One would answer that the devil alone knows, and then spit and close the book.” Such were the unfavourable comments which Chichikov passed upon balls in general. With it all, however, there went a second source of dissatisfaction. That is to say, his principal grudge was not so much against balls as against the fact that at this particular one he had been exposed, he had been made to disclose the circumstance that he had been playing a strange, an ambiguous part. Of course, when he reviewed the contretemps in the light of pure reason, he could not but see that it mattered nothing, and that a few rude words were of no account now that the chief point had been attained; yet man is an odd creature, and Chichikov actually felt pained by the cold-shouldering administered to him by persons for whom he had not an atom of respect, and whose vanity and love of display he had only that moment been censuring. Still more, on viewing the matter clearly, he felt vexed to think that he himself had been so largely the cause of the catastrophe. Yet he was not angry with HIMSELF—of that you may be sure, seeing that all of us have a slight weakness for sparing our own faults, and always do our best to find some fellow-creature upon whom to vent our displeasure—whether that fellow-creature be a servant, a subordinate official, or a wife. In the same way Chichikov sought a scapegoat upon whose shoulders he could lay the blame for all that had annoyed him. He found one in Nozdrev, and you may be sure that the scapegoat in question received a good drubbing from every side, even as an experienced captain or chief of police will give a knavish starosta or postboy a rating not only in the terms become classical, but also in such terms as the said captain or chief of police may invent for himself. In short, Nozdrev’s whole lineage was passed in review; and many of its members in the ascending line fared badly in the process.","There, in that little room so familiar to the reader, with the door blocked up by a chest of drawers, and cockroaches occasionally peeking from the corners, the state of his mind and spirit was uncomfortable, as uncomfortable as the armchair in which he sat. His heart felt unpleasant, troubled; some burdensome emptiness lingered in it. “Devil take all of you who thought up these balls!” he said in vexation. “What are the fools so glad about? There are crop failures, high prices in the provinces, and here they are with their balls! A fine thing: decked out in their female rags! So what if she’s wrapped herself in a thousand roubles’ worth! And it’s at the expense of peasant quitrent or, worse still, at the expense of our own good conscience. Everyone knows why you take bribes and bend the truth: so as to pay for your wife’s shawl or hoopskirt or whatever they’re called, confound them. And what for? So that some strumpet Sidorovna won’t say the postmaster’s wife’s dress was better, and so—bang, there goes a thousand roubles. They shout: ‘A ball, a ball, a gay time!’—a ball is just trash, not in the Russian spirit, not in the Russian nature; devil knows what it is: an adult, a man of age, suddenly pops out all in black, plucked and tightly fitted like a little imp, and goes mincing away with his feet. Some man, dancing with his partner, can be discussing important business with someone else, while at the same time twirling his legs right and left like a little goat … It’s all apery, all apery! The Frenchman at forty is the same child he was at fifteen, so let’s all do likewise! No, really … after each ball it’s as if you’d committed some sin; you don’t even want to remember it. The head is simply empty, as after talking with a man of society; he talks about all sorts of things, touches lightly on everything, says everything he’s pulled out of books, brightly, prettily, but there’s no trace of any of it in his head, and you see then that even talking with a simple merchant who knows only his business, but knows it firmly and practically, is better than all these baubles. So, what can possibly be squeezed out of this ball? So, what if some writer, say, decided to describe the whole scene as it is? So, then in the book it would come out just as witless as in nature. What is it—moral? immoral? It’s simply devil-knows-what! You’d spit and close the book.” So unfavorable was Chichikov’s opinion of balls in general; but it seems another reason for indignation was mixed in here. He was mainly vexed not at the ball, but at the fact that he had happened to trip up, that he had suddenly appeared before everyone looking like God knows what, that he had played some strange, ambiguous role. Of course, looking at it with the eye of a reasonable man, he saw that it was all absurd, that a stupid word meant nothing, particularly now, when the main business had already been properly done. But man is strange: he was greatly upset by the ill disposition of those very people whom he did not respect and with regard to whom he had spoken so sharply, denouncing their vanity and finery. This was the more vexatious to him since, on sorting out the matter clearly, he saw that he himself was partly the cause of it. He did not, however, get angry with himself, and in that, of course, he was right. We all have a little weakness for sparing ourselves somewhat, and prefer to try and find some neighbor on whom to vent our vexation, a servant, for instance, or a subordinate official who turns up at that moment, or a wife, or, finally, a chair, which gets flung devil knows where, straight at the door, so that the armrest and back come flying off: that will teach it what wrath is. So Chichikov, too, soon found a neighbor who could drag onto his own back everything his vexation might suggest to him. This neighbor was Nozdryov, and, needless to say, he got it from all sides and ends, as only some crook of a village elder or coachman gets it from some traveled, experienced captain, or even general, who on top of many expressions that have become classical, adds many unknown ones, the invention of which belongs properly to himself. The whole of Nozdryov’s genealogy was examined and many members of his family in the line of ascent suffered greatly.","There, in that small room which is so familiar to the reader, with the door to the adjoining room blocked off by a bureau, and with the cockroaches occasionally peeping out of their corners, the state of his thoughts and spirit was just as uneasy as that misnamed easy chair in which he was sitting. His heart was troubled, confused; some oppressive void persisted therein. “May the Devil take all of you who invented these balls!” he soliloquized, heartily vexed. “There, what are they rejoicing over, like so many fools? There are poor crops throughout the province; prices are sky-high; and so they go in for balls! What a thing to astonish one with, dolling themselves up in womanish rags! What a rare sight, one of them swathing herself in a thousand rubles’ worth of trumpery! And all this is at the expense of the serfs’ quitrents or, which is still worse, at the expense of your conscience. For everyone knows why you take a bribe and perjure your soul, so’s to get enough for your wife’s fancy shawl or all sorts of robes-rondes, or whatever they call ’em, may they all fall into the bottomless pit! And what’s it all about? So that some gossiping wench Sidorovna might not say that the Postmaster’s wife had a better gown on her than your wife, and over that trollop’s word, bang! goes a thousand rubles. ‘A ball! A ball! What fun!’ they shout. A ball is just so much rubbishy foolishness. It isn’t in the Russian spirit, nor after the Russian nature. The Devil alone knows what it is; a full-grown man, of mature age, will suddenly jump out in the middle of the floor, dressed all in black, all tweezered and slicked up, his clothes so tight-fitting on him that they make him look like an imp, and starts off mincing and prancing. One of these fellows, even while he’s paired off for the dance, will be talking some important matter over with another man, yet at the same time his legs will be cutting capers like a young goat’s, now to the right, now to the left ... as if there were fleas biting him! Just to be a copy-cat, just to be a copycat! Since the Frenchman at forty is as much of an infant as he was at fifteen, let’s do the same thing too! No, really . .. after every ball one feels just as if one had committed some sin; one doesn’t want even to remind oneself of it. There’s simply nothing at all inside your head, as after a conversation with a man from high society: he’ll give you a heap of talk about all sorts of things, he’ll touch on all things lightly, he’ll tell you everything he has gotten a smattering of out of books—motley, pretty talk—but you just go and try to carry anything of it away in your head and you’ll see later on that a talk with even a common merchant, who knows nothing but his own business, yet knows it soundly and through experience, is better than all these tinkly baubles. There, what can you squeeze out of it, out of this ball? There, what if we were to suppose that some writer or other had gotten it into his head to describe all this scene, as is? Why, even there, even in a book, it would turn out just as senseless as it is in nature. What is that scene? Is it moral or immoral? Why, only the Devil knows just what it is! You spit in disgust and then slam the book shut.” Thus did Chichikov inveigh against balls in general; but apparently there was still another cause of indignation mixed in here. His chief vexation was not against the ball, but because he had chanced to come a cropper, because he had suddenly appeared before the eyes of all in God knows what guise, because he had played some sort of bizarre, equivocal role. Of course, after looking at it with the eye of a prudent, sensible man, he saw that all this was so much bosh, that a foolish word didn’t mean a thing, especially now, when the main business had already been fully put through, all right and proper. But man is a strange creature: Chichikov was powerfully aggrieved by the attitude of dislike on the part of those very people for whom he had no respect and of whom he spoke so harshly, condemning their worldly vanity and their gay raiment. This matter was all the more vexatious to him because, having analyzed it clearly, he perceived that he himself had been in part the cause of it. He did not, however, get angry at himself, and, of course, was right in this. We all of us have a slight weakness of sparing ourselves a little; we’d rather try to seek out some fellow man on whom we may vent our chagrin—a servant, for instance, or some petty clerk, some underling of ours who turns up at the opportune moment, one’s wife, or, finally, a chair, which will be thrown the Devil knows how far, against the very door, so that its back and one of its arms will fly off—there, take that, and know what it means to arouse our wrath! And so Chichikov, too, speedily found a fellow man who had to shoulder all that chagrin could inspire our hero with. This fellow man was none other than Nozdrev, and it need hardly be said that he was so well basted on all sides and quarters as only a knave of a village elder or a coachman is basted by some experienced army captain who has been around, or occasionally even by a general who, in addition to many expressions which have become classics, will add a great many as yet unknown, the invention of which appertains to him alone. Nozdrev’s entire family tree was splintered into kindling, and many members of his family in the ascendant line had to suffer grievously."
"Подъехавши к трактиру, Чичиков велел остановиться по двум причинам. С одной стороны, чтоб дать отдохнуть лошадям, а с другой стороны, чтоб и самому несколько закусить и подкрепиться. Автор должен признаться, что весьма завидует аппетиту и желудку такого рода людей. Для него решительно ничего не значат все господа большой руки, живущие в Петербурге и Москве, проводящие время в обдумывании, что бы такое поесть завтра и какой бы обед сочинить на послезавтра, и принимающиеся за этот обед не иначе, как отправивши прежде в рот пилюлю; глотающие устерс, морских пауков и прочих чуд, а потом отправляющиеся в Карлсбад или на Кавказ. Нет, эти господа никогда не возбуждали в нем зависти. Но господа средней руки, что на одной станции потребуют ветчины, на другой поросенка, на третьей ломоть осетра или какую-нибудь запеканную колбасу с луком и потом как ни в чем не бывало садятся за стол в какое хочешь время, и стерляжья уха с налимами и молоками шипит и ворчит у них меж зубами, заедаемая расстегаем или кулебякой с сомовьим плёсом,[6] так что вчуже пронимает аппетит, — вот эти господа, точно, пользуются завидным даянием неба! Не один господин большой руки пожертвовал бы сию же минуту половину душ крестьян и половину имений, заложенных и только, чтобы иметь такой желудок, какой имеет господин средней руки; но то беда, что ни за какие деньги, ниже́ имения, с улучшениями и без улучшений, нельзя приобресть такого желудка, какой бывает у господина средней руки.","Arriving at the tavern, Chichikov ordered to stop for two reasons. On the one hand, to give the horses a rest, and on the other hand, to have a bite to eat and refresh yourself. The author must confess that he is very envious of the appetite and stomach of such people. For him, all the gentlemen of a big hand who live in St. Petersburg and Moscow, who spend their time thinking about what to eat tomorrow and what kind of dinner to compose for the day after tomorrow, and who take up this dinner only after putting a pill in their mouth, mean absolutely nothing; swallowing oysters, sea spiders and other miracles, and then going to Carlsbad or the Caucasus. No, these gentlemen never aroused envy in him. But gentlemen of the middle class, that at one station they would demand ham, at another a pig, at a third a slice of sturgeon or some kind of baked sausage with onions, and then, as if nothing had happened, sit down at the table at any time you want, and sterlet's ear with burbots and sizzles with milk and grumbles between their teeth, munching on a pie or a kulebyaka with a catfish plow,[6] so that it alienates the appetite - these gentlemen, indeed, enjoy the enviable gift of heaven! Not one gentleman of a great hand would immediately donate half the souls of the peasants and half the estates mortgaged, and only in order to have such a stomach as a gentleman of an average hand has; but the misfortune is that for no amount of money, less than an estate, with or without improvements, one can acquire such a stomach as is found in a gentleman of an average hand.","As they approached the tavern, Tchitchikov told Selifan to stop for two reasons, that the horses might rest and also that he might himself have a little refreshment. The author must admit that he greatly envies the appetite and digestion of such people. He has no great opinion of all the grand gentlemen living in Petersburg and Moscow who spend their time in deliberating what to eat tomorrow and what to have for dinner the day after, and who invariably put pills into their mouths before beginning on the dinner, then swallow oysters, lobsters, and other strange things and afterwards go for a cure to Carlsbadaj or the Caucasus.ak No, those gentlemen have never excited his envy. But the gentlemen of the middling sort who ask for ham at one station and sucking-pig at the next, a slice of sturgeon or some fried sausage and onion at the third, and then, as though nothing had happened, sit down to table at any time you please, and with a hissing, gurgling sound gulp down a sturgeon-soup full of eel-poutsal and soft roes to the accompaniment of a turnover or a fish patty, so that it makes other people hungry to look at them—yes, these gentlemen certainly do enjoy a blessing that may well be envied! More than one grand gentleman would any minute sacrifice half his peasants and half his estates, mortgaged and unmortgaged, with all the improvements in foreign and Russian style, only to possess a digestion such as that of a middle-class gentleman. But the worst of it is that no money, nor even estates with or without improvements can procure a digestion like that of a middle-class gentleman.","On reaching the tavern, Chichikov called a halt. His reasons for this were twofold—namely, that he wanted to rest the horses, and that he himself desired some refreshment. In this connection the author feels bound to confess that the appetite and the capacity of such men are greatly to be envied. Of those well-to-do folk of St. Petersburg and Moscow who spend their time in considering what they shall eat on the morrow, and in composing a dinner for the day following, and who never sit down to a meal without first of all injecting a pill and then swallowing oysters and crabs and a quantity of other monsters, while eternally departing for Karlsbad or the Caucasus, the author has but a small opinion. Yes, THEY are not the persons to inspire envy. Rather, it is the folk of the middle classes—folk who at one posthouse call for bacon, and at another for a sucking pig, and at a third for a steak of sturgeon or a baked pudding with onions, and who can sit down to table at any hour, as though they had never had a meal in their lives, and can devour fish of all sorts, and guzzle and chew it with a view to provoking further appetite— these, I say, are the folk who enjoy heaven’s most favoured gift. To attain such a celestial condition the great folk of whom I have spoken would sacrifice half their serfs and half their mortgaged and non-mortgaged property, with the foreign and domestic improvements thereon, if thereby they could compass such a stomach as is possessed by the folk of the middle class. But, unfortunately, neither money nor real estate, whether improved or non-improved, can purchase such a stomach.","Driving up to the tavern, Chichikov ordered a stop for two reasons. On the one hand, so that the horses could rest, and on the other hand, so that he could have a little snack and fortify himself. The author must admit that he is quite envious of the appetite and stomach of this sort of people. To him those gentlemen of the grand sort mean decidedly nothing, who live in Petersburg or Moscow, spend their time pondering what they would like to eat the next day and what dinner to devise for the day after, and who will not partake of that dinner without first sending a pill into their mouths; who swallow oysters, sea spiders, and other marvels, and then set off for Karlsbad or the Caucasus.9 No, those gentlemen have never aroused envy in him. But gentlemen of the middling sort, those who order ham at one station, suckling pig at another, a hunk of sturgeon or some baked sausage with onions at a third, and then sit down to table as if nothing had happened, whenever you like, and a sterlet soup with burbot and soft roe hisses and gurgles between their teeth, accompanied by a tart or pie with catfish tails, so that even a vicarious appetite is piqued—now, these gentlemen indeed enjoy an enviable gift from heaven! More than one gentleman of the grand sort would instantly sacrifice half of his peasant souls and half of his estates, mortgaged and unmortgaged, with all improvements on a foreign or Russian footing, only so as to have a stomach such as a gentleman of the middling sort has; but the trouble is that no amount of money, no estates with or without improvements, can buy such a stomach as the gentleman of the middling sort happens to have.","As he was driving up to the tavern, Chichikov ordered Selifan to stop for two reasons: on the one hand, to give the horses a chance to rest, and, on the other, to have a bite of something and fortify himself as well. The author must confess that he is quite envious of the appetites and stomachs of this sort of people. All the top-notch people living in St. Petersburg and Moscow mean absolutely nothing to him—people who spend their time thoughtfully planning what they may eat tomorrow, and what sort of dinner to contrive for the day after, and who sit down to this dinner not otherwise than after having popped some pills into their mouths; people who gulp down oysters, sea spiders, and other such wondrous viands and eventually wind up with having to go to the baths at Karlsbad or to take the medicinal waters in the Caucasus. No, these gentry have never aroused any envy in me. But you take some of these fair-to-middlin’ gentlemen, who will call for ham at one stage post, a suckling pig at a second, and at a third for a slice of sturgeon, or some sort of sausage baked with onions, and then, as if they hadn’t eaten a thing all day, will sit down at a full table, at any hour you like, and tackle sterlet chowder, with eelpouts and soft roe, so hot it hisses and burbles as they take it into their mouths, followed, as a sort of chaser, by a fish pie with millet porridge, or cabbage dumplings, or a pie baked of young catfish, so that even an onlooker must needs work up an appetite—now, these gentlemen really are enjoying an enviable gift from Heaven! More than one top-notch gentleman would sacrifice in a moment half the number of serfs he possesses and half his estates (mortgaged and unmortgaged, with all the improvements both foreign and domestic), just to have such a stomach as the fair-to-middlin’ gentleman possesses. But that’s where the trouble lies, that one cannot acquire, either for any sum of money or for any estate (either with improvements or without), such a stomach as you will find a fair-to-middlin’ gentleman possessed of."
"— Да вот, ваше превосходительство, как!.. — Тут Чичиков осмотрелся и, увидя, что камердинер с лоханкою вышел, начал так: — Есть у меня дядя, дряхлый старик. У него триста душ и, кроме меня, наследников никого. Сам управлять именьем, по дряхлости, не может, а мне не передает тоже. И какой странный приводит резон:","“Yes, your Excellency, how!” Here Chichikov looked around and, seeing that the valet had come out with a tub, he began like this: “I have an uncle, a decrepit old man. He has three hundred souls and no heirs besides me. Due to decrepitude, he cannot manage the estate himself, but he does not transfer it to me either. And what a strange reason leads:","“This is how it is, your Excellency.” At this point Tchitchikov looked round and seeing that the valet with the basin had gone, began as follows: “I have an uncle, a decrepit old man. He has three hundred souls and no heirs except me. He can’t look after the estate himself, for he is too feeble, and he won’t hand it over to me either. And the reason he gives for not doing so is very queer: ‘I don’t know my nephew,’ he says; ‘perhaps he is a spendthrift, let him prove that he is a reliable person, let him get three hundred souls on his own account first","“It is this, your Excellency. I have a decrepit old uncle who owns three hundred souls and two thousand roubles-worth of other property. Also, except for myself, he possesses not a single heir. Now, although his infirm state of health will not permit of his managing his property in person, he will not allow me either to manage it. And the reason for his conduct—his very strange conduct—he states as follows: ‘I do not know my nephew, and very likely he is a spendthrift.","“Here’s how, Your Excellency!… ” At this point Chichikov looked around and, seeing that the valet with the basin had left, began thus: “I have an uncle, a decrepit old man. He owns three hundred souls and has no heirs except me. He himself, being decrepit, cannot manage the estate, yet he won’t hand it over to me. And he gives such a strange reason: ‘I don’t know my nephew,’ he says, ‘maybe he’s a spendthrift.",

"— Извольте, я готов продать, — сказал Собакевич, уже несколько приподнявши голову и смекнувши, что покупщик, верно, должен иметь здесь какую-нибудь выгоду.","“Excuse me, I’m ready to sell,” said Sobakevich, already raising his head somewhat and realizing that the buyer must surely have some advantage here.","“Certainly, I am willing to sell them,” said Sobakevitch, slightly raising his head, and reflecting that doubtless the purchaser would make some profit out of them. “Deuce take it!”","“Yes, I shall have no objection to SELLING them.” At this point the speaker raised his head a little, for it had struck him that surely the would-be buyer must have some advantage in view.","“If you like, I’m ready to sell,” said Sobakevich, now raising his head slightly, as he realized that the buyer must certainly see some profit in it.","“I’m ready to sell them, if you like,” said Sobakevich, this time with his head somewhat raised, and surmising that the buyer must surely have some advantage in view here."
"— Противузаконная, однако ж, вещь, — сказал Вишнепокромов, — капиталы не должны быть в одних руках. Это теперь предмет трактатов во всей Европе. Имеешь деньги, — ну, сообщай другим: угощай, давай балы, производи благодетельную роскошь, которая дает хлеб мастерам, ремесленникам.","“An illegal thing, however,” said Vishnepokromov, “capital should not be in the same hands. It is now the subject of treatises throughout Europe. If you have money, well, inform others: treat, give balls, produce beneficent luxury, which gives bread to masters, artisans.","“It isn’t the right state of things though,” said Vishnepokromov, “capital ought not to be in one man’s hands. That is the subject of ever so many treatises all over Europe nowadays. If you have money, well, share it with others: entertain, give balls, keep up a beneficent luxury that gives bread to tradesmen and artisans.”","“I wonder what is afoot between them,” said Chichikov to himself.","“It’s not a rightful thing, though,” said Vishnepokromov, “capital shouldn’t be in one man’s hands. That’s even the subject of treatises now all over Europe. You have money—so, share it with others: treat people, give balls, produce beneficent luxury, which gives bread to the artisans, the master craftsmen.”",
"— Да-с, благодаря бога недурно. Но нужно бы дождичка для посева.","— Yes, thank God not bad. But it would need rain for sowing.","Hlobuev answered, “Very good, Afanasy Vassilyevitch.”","“I wonder what is afoot between them,” said Chichikov to himself.","“Yes, sir, thank God, it’s not bad. But we need a bit of rain for the crops.”",
"— Нет, никакого Воробья я не приписывал, — сказал Собакевич и отошел к другим гостям.","“No, I didn’t attribute any Sparrow,” said Sobakevich and went to the other guests.","“No, I did not stick in any Vorobey,” said Sobakevitch, and he walked off to rejoin the others.","“I added no such name,” replied Sobakevitch, and straightway joined the other guests.","“No, I never stuck in any Sparrow,” said Sobakevich, and he went over to the other guests.","“No, I never tacked on any Sparrow,” said Sobakevich, but walked away to join the others."
"— Я полагаю приобресть мертвых, которые, впрочем, значились бы по ревизии как живые, — сказал Чичиков.","""I'm thinking of acquiring the dead, which, however, would be listed as living according to the revision,"" said Chichikov.","“I propose to purchase dead ones who would yet appear on the census list as alive,” said Tchitchikov.","“All that I am proposing to do,” replied Chichikov, “is to purchase the dead peasants who, at the last census, were returned by you as alive.”","“I propose to acquire dead ones, who would, however, be counted in the census as living,” said Chichikov.","“I proposed to acquire the dead people, who, however, would be designated as alive in the Bureau of Audits,” said Chichikov."
"Совершенно успокоившись и укрепившись, он с небрежною ловкостью бросился на эластические подушки коляски, приказал Селифану откинуть кузов назад (к юрисконсульту он ехал с поднятым кузовом и даже застегнутой кожей) и расположился, точь-в-точь как отставной гусарский полковник или сам Вишнепокромов — ловко подвернувши одну ножку под другую, обратя с приятностью ко встречным лицо, сиявшее из-под шелковой новой шляпы, надвинутой несколько на ухо. Селифану было приказано держать направленье к гостиному двору. Купцы, и приезжие и туземные, стоя у дверей лавок, почтительно снимали шляпы, и Чичиков, не без достоинства, приподнимал им в ответ свою. Многие из них уже были ему знакомы; другие были хоть приезжие, но, очарованные ловким видом умеющего держать себя господина, приветствовали его, как знакомые. Ярмарка в городе Тьфуславле не прекращалась. Отошла конная и земледельческая, началась — с красными товарами для господ просвещенья высшего. Купцы, приехавшие на колесах, располагали назад не иначе возвращаться, как на санях.","Having completely calmed down and strengthened himself, with careless dexterity he threw himself on the elastic cushions of the carriage, ordered Selifan to tilt the body back (he went to the legal adviser with the body raised and even buttoned up with the skin) and settled down, exactly like a retired hussar colonel or Vishnepokromov himself - deftly tucking one leg under the other, turning with pleasantness to the oncoming faces, shining from under a new silk hat, pulled slightly over his ear. Selifan was ordered to keep in the direction of the Gostiny Dvor. Merchants, both visitors and natives, standing at the doors of the shops, respectfully took off their hats, and Chichikov, not without dignity, raised his to them in response. Many of them were already familiar to him; others were at least newcomers, but, fascinated by the dexterous appearance of a gentleman who knew how to behave, they greeted him as if they were acquaintances. The fair in the city of Tfuslavl did not stop. The equestrian and agricultural industries departed, they began - with red goods for the gentlemen of higher enlightenment. The merchants, who arrived on wheels, had no other way to return than by sleigh.","Completely reassured and fortified, he flung himself with careless agility on the resilient cushions of the carriage, told Selifan to draw back the hood of the carriage (he had had the hood up and even the leather covers buttoned on his way to the lawyer’s) and settled himself like a retired colonel of the Hussars, or even like Vishnepokromov himself, jauntily crossing one leg over the other, turning affably towards the people he met, and beaming under his new silk hat which was tilted a little over one ear. Selifan was told to turn in the direction of the bazaar. Both the travelling dealers and the local shopkeepers standing at their doors took off their hats respectfully, and Tchitchikov not without dignity lifted his in response. Many of them he knew already; others, though strangers, were so charmed by the smart air of the gentleman who knew so well how to deport himself, that they greeted him as though they too were acquaintances. There was a continual fair going on in the town of Tfooslavl. As soon as the horse fair and the agricultural fair were over, there followed one for the sale of drapery for gentlemen of the utmost refinement. Dealers who arrived in wheeled carriages stayed on till they had to depart in sledges. “Pray walk in!”","There also developed a tendency to compete in the matter of horses and liveried flunkeys; with the result that despite the damp and snowy weather exceedingly elegant turnouts took to parading backwards and forwards. Whence these equipages had come God only knows, but at least they would not have disgraced St. Petersburg. From within them merchants and attorneys doffed their caps to ladies, and inquired after their health, and likewise it became a rare sight to see a bearded man in a rough fur cap, since every one now went about clean-shaven and with dirty teeth, after the European fashion.","Having been completely reassured and reinforced, he threw himself back on the springy cushions of the carriage with careless adroitness, ordered Selifan to take the top down ( as he went to the lawyer, he had the top up and even the apron buttoned), and settled exactly like a retired colonel of the hussars, or Vishnepokromov himself—adroitly tucking one leg under the other, turning his face agreeably towards passersby, beaming from under the new silk hat cocked slightly over one ear. Selifan was ordered to proceed in the direction of the shopping arcade. Merchants, both itinerant and aboriginal, standing at the doors of their shops, reverently took their hats off, and Chichikov, not without dignity, raised his own in response. Many of them were already known to him; others, though itinerant, being charmed by the adroit air of this gentleman who knew how to bear himself, greeted him like an acquaintance. The fair in the town of Phooeyslavl was never-ending. After the horse fair and the agricultural fair were over, there came the fair of luxury goods for gentlefolk of high cultivation. The merchants who came on wheels planned to go home not otherwise than on sleds.",

"«Кто бы такой был этот Чичиков? — думал брат Василий. — Брат Платон на знакомства неразборчив и, верно, не узнал, что он за человек». И оглянул он Чичикова, насколько позволяло приличие, и увидел, что он стоял, несколько наклонивши голову и сохранив приятное выраженье в лице.","“Who would this Chichikov be? - thought brother Vasily. “Brother Plato is illegible for acquaintances and, probably, did not find out what kind of person he was.” And he glanced at Chichikov, as far as decency permitted, and saw that he was standing with his head slightly bowed and a pleasant expression on his face.","“What sort of man is this Tchitchikov?” thought “brother Vassily.” “Brother Platon is not very discriminating in his acquaintances, and probably has not found out what sort of a man he is.” He scrutinised Tchitchikov so far as was consistent with good manners. Meanwhile Tchitchikov stood with his head a little on one side, and maintained an agreeable expression on his countenance.","“What sort of man is this Chichikov?” thought Vassili. “As a rule my brother Platon is not over-nice in his choice of acquaintances.” And, eyeing our hero as narrowly as civility permitted, he saw that his appearance was that of a perfectly respectable individual. Chichikov returned Vassili’s scrutiny with a similar observance of the dictates of civility, and perceived that he was shorter than Platon, that his hair was of a darker shade, and that his features, though less handsome, contained far more life, animation, and kindliness than did his brother’s.","“Who might this Chichikov be?” thought brother Vassily. “Brother Platon isn’t fastidious about his acquaintances, he certainly did not find out what sort of man he is.” And he looked Chichikov over as far as decency allowed, and saw that he was standing with his head slightly inclined, and had an agreeable look on his face.",

"— Средства-то есть, — сказал Хлобуев и вслед за тем выгрузил им целую кучу прожектов. Все они были до того нелепы, так странны, так мало истекали из познанья людей и света, что оставалось только пожимать плечами да говорить: «Господи боже! какое необъятное расстояние между знаньем света и уменьем пользоваться этим знаньем!» Почти все прожекты основывались на потребности вдруг достать откуда-нибудь сто или двести тысяч. Тогда, казалось ему, все бы устроилось как следует, и хозяйство бы пошло, и прорехи все бы заплетались, и доходы можно учетверить, и себя привести в возможность выплатить все долги. И оканчивал он речь свою: — Но что прикажете делать? Нет, да и нет такого благодетеля, который бы решился дать двести или хоть сто тысяч взаймы! Видно, уж бог не хочет.","“The funds are there,” said Khlobuev, and after that he unloaded a whole bunch of searchlights for them. All of them were so absurd, so strange, they flowed so little from the knowledge of people and the world, that all that remained was to shrug their shoulders and say: “Lord, God! what an immense distance between the knowledge of the world and the ability to use this knowledge!” Almost all projects were based on the need to suddenly get a hundred or two hundred thousand from somewhere. Then, it seemed to him, everything would be arranged as it should be, and the economy would go on, and the gaps would all be braided, and incomes could be quadrupled, and one could bring oneself to the opportunity to pay all debts. And he finished his speech: - But what do you want to do? No, and indeed there is no such benefactor who would dare to lend two hundred or even a hundred thousand! Clearly, God doesn't want to.","“But I can,” answered Hlobuev, and thereupon he poured out a perfect avalanche of projects. They were all so absurd, so odd, and were so little the result of a knowledge of men and the world that there was nothing for it but to shrug one’s shoulders and say: “Good Lord, what a fathomless gulf there is between knowledge of the world and the capacity for making use of it!” Almost all his projects rested upon the possibility of obtaining at once by some means a hundred or even two hundred thousand roubles. Then, so he fancied, everything could be settled satisfactorily and the estate would be properly run and the rents would be patched, and the revenues would be quadrupled, and it would be in his power to pay all his debts. And he ended his talk by saying: “But what would you have me do? There isn’t any benefactor who would venture to lend me two hundred or even one hundred thousand roubles! It seems it is not God’s will.”","“But I have plenty of both,” said Khlobuev, and with that went on to deliver himself of a perfect avalanche of projects. Yet those projects proved to be so uncouth, so clumsy, so little the outcome of a knowledge of men and things, that his hearers could only shrug their shoulders and mentally exclaim: “Good Lord! What a difference between worldly wisdom and the capacity to use it!” In every case the projects in question were based upon the imperative necessity of at once procuring from somewhere two hundred—or at least one hundred—thousand roubles. That done (so Khlobuev averred), everything would fall into its proper place, the holes in his pockets would become stopped, his income would be quadrupled, and he would find himself in a position to liquidate his debts in full. Nevertheless he ended by saying: “What would you advise me to do? I fear that the philanthropist who would lend me two hundred thousand roubles or even a hundred thousand, does not exist. It is not God’s will that he should.”","said Khlobuev, and forthwith unloaded on them a whole heap of projects. They were all so absurd, so strange, so little consequent upon a knowledge of people and the world, that it remained only to shrug one’s shoulders and say: “Good lord! what an infinite distance there is between knowledge of the world and the ability to use that knowledge!” Almost all the projects were based on the need for suddenly procuring a hundred or two hundred thousand somewhere. Then, it seemed to him, everything could be arranged properly, and the management would get under way, and all the holes would be patched, and the income would be quadrupled, and it would be possible for him to repay all his debts. And he would end with the words: “But what do you want me to do? There simply is no such benefactor as would decide to lend me two hundred or at least one hundred thousand! Clearly, God is against it.”",
"— Ну, бог с вами, давайте по тридцати и берите их себе!","- Well, God bless you, let's thirty and take them for yourself!","“Well, God bless you, give me thirty and you shall have them!”","“At least give me thirty roubles in assignats, and take the lot.”","“Well, God help you, give me thirty and take them!”","“Well, God be with you, give me thirty rubles a head and take them as your own!”"
"Собравшись у полицеймейстера, уже известного читателям отца и благодетеля города, чиновники имели случай заметить друг другу, что они даже похудели от этих забот и тревог. В самом деле, назначение нового генерал-губернатора, и эти полученные бумаги такого сурьезного содержания, и эти бог знает какие слухи — все это оставило заметные следы в их лицах, и фраки на многих сделались заметно просторней. Все подалось: и председатель похудел, и инспектор врачебной управы похудел, и прокурор похудел, и какой-то Семен Иванович, никогда не называвшийся по фамилии, носивший на указательном пальце перстень, который давал рассматривать дамам, даже и тот похудел. Конечно, нашлись, как и везде бывает, кое-кто неробкого десятка, которые не теряли присутствия духа, но их было весьма немного. Почтмейстер один только. Он один не изменялся в постоянно ровном характере и всегда в подобных случаях имел обыкновение говорить: «Знаем мы вас, генерал-губернаторов! Вас, может быть, три-четыре переменится, а я вот уже тридцать лет, судырь мой, сижу на одном месте». На это обыкновенно замечали другие чиновники: «Хорошо тебе, шпрехен зи дейч Иван Андрейч, у тебя дело почтовое: принять да отправить экспедицию; разве только надуешь, заперши присутствие часом раньше, да возьмешь с опоздавшего купца за прием письма в неуказанное время или перешлешь иную посылку, которую не следует пересылать, — тут, конечно, всякий будет святой. А вот пусть к тебе повадится черт подвертываться всякий день под руку, так что вот и не хочешь брать, а он сам сует. Тебе, разумеется, сполагоря, у тебя один сынишка, а тут, брат, Прасковью Федоровну наделил бог такою благодатию, что год, то несет: либо Праскушку, либо Петрушку: тут, брат, другое запоешь». Так говорили чиновники, а можно ли в самом деле устоять против черта, об этом судить не авторское дело. В собравшемся на сей раз совете очень заметно было отсутствие той необходимой вещи, которую в простонародье называют толком. Вообще мы как-то не создались для представительных заседаний. Во всех наших собраниях, начиная от крестьянской мирской сходки до всяких возможных ученых и прочих комитетов, если в них нет одной главы, управляющей всем, присутствует препорядочная путаница. Трудно даже и сказать, почему это; видно, уже народ такой, только и удаются те совещания, которые составляются для того, чтобы помутить или пообедать, как-то: клубы и всякие воксалы[26] на немецкую ногу. А готовность всякую минуту есть, пожалуй, на все. Мы вдруг, как ветер повеет, заведем общества благотворительные, поощрительные и невесть какие. Цель будет прекрасна, а при всем том ничего не выйдет. Может быть, это происходит оттого, что мы вдруг удовлетворяемся в самом начале и уже почитаем, что все сделано. Например, затеявши какое-нибудь благотворительное общество для бедных и пожертвовавши значительные суммы, мы тотчас в ознаменование такого похвального поступка задаем обед всем первым сановникам города, разумеется, на половину всех пожертвованных сумм; на остальные нанимается тут же для комитета великолепная квартира, с отоплением и сторожами, а затем и остается всей суммы для бедных пять рублей с полтиною, да и тут в распределении этой суммы еще не все члены согласны между собою, и всякий сует какую-нибудь свою куму. Впрочем, собравшееся ныне совещание было совершенно другого рода: оно образовалось вследствие необходимости. Не о каких-либо бедных или посторонних шло дело, дело касалось всякого чиновника лично, дело касалось беды, всем равно грозившей; стало быть, поневоле тут должно быть единодушнее, теснее. Но при всем том вышло черт знает что такое. Не говоря уже о разногласиях, свойственных всем советам, во мнении собравшихся обнаружилась какая-то даже непостижимая нерешительность: один говорил, что Чичиков делатель государственных ассигнаций, и потом сам прибавлял: «а может быть, и не делатель»; другой утверждал, что он чиновник генерал-губернаторской канцелярии, и тут же присовокуплял: «а впрочем, черт его знает, на лбу ведь не прочтешь». Против догадки, не переодетый ли разбойник, вооружились все; нашли, что сверх наружности, которая сама по себе была уже благонамеренна, в разговорах его ничего не было такого, которое бы показывало человека с буйными поступками. Вдруг почтмейстер, остававшийся несколько минут погруженным в какое-то размышление, вследствие ли внезапного вдохновения, осенившего его, или чего иного, вскрикнул неожиданно:","Gathering at the police chief, already known to readers as the father and benefactor of the city, the officials had the opportunity to remark to each other that they even lost weight from these worries and anxieties. In fact, the appointment of a new Governor-General, and these papers of such serious content, and these God knows what rumors - all this left noticeable marks on their faces, and the tailcoats on many became noticeably more spacious. Everything worked out: the chairman lost weight, and the inspector of the medical board lost weight, and the prosecutor lost weight, and some Semyon Ivanovich, never called by his last name, who wore a ring on his index finger, which allowed the ladies to examine it, even he lost weight. Of course, there were, as happens everywhere, a few ten who did not lose their presence of mind, but there were very few of them. There is only one postmaster. He alone did not change in a constantly even character and always in such cases was in the habit of saying: “We know you, governors general! Maybe three or four of you will change, but for thirty years now, my sir, I have been sitting in one place. Other officials usually remarked on this: “It’s good for you, sprechen zi deutsch Ivan Andreich, you have a postal business: to accept and send an expedition; unless you cheat by blocking the presence an hour earlier, and charge a late merchant for receiving a letter at an unspecified time, or send another parcel that should not be forwarded - then, of course, everyone will be a saint. But let the devil get into the habit of tucking into your arm every day, so that you don’t want to take it, but he himself fusses. You, of course, happily, you have one little son, and here, brother, God endowed Praskovya Fedorovna with such grace that a year brings either Praskushka or Petrushka: here, brother, you’ll sing something else. So the officials said, but is it really possible to resist the devil, it is not up to the author to judge this. In the council assembled this time, the absence of that necessary thing, which the common people call plainly, was very noticeable. In general, we were somehow not created for representative meetings. In all our meetings, from the peasant secular gathering to all sorts of possible scholars and other committees, if they do not have one head that governs everything, there is a great confusion. It is even difficult to say why this is; it is evident that the people are already like that, only those meetings are successful that are arranged in order to stir up or dine, somehow: clubs and all sorts of voxals[26] on a German footing. And readiness every minute is, perhaps, for everything. All of a sudden, as the wind blows, we will start charitable, incentive and who knows what societies. The goal will be beautiful, but for all that, nothing will come of it. Perhaps this happens because we are suddenly satisfied at the very beginning and already revere that everything is done. For example, having started some kind of charitable society for the poor and having donated significant sums, we immediately, in commemoration of such a laudable deed, set a dinner for all the first dignitaries of the city, of course, for half of all the donated amounts; for the rest, a magnificent apartment is immediately rented for the committee, with heating and watchmen, and then the whole amount for the poor remains five rubles and a half, and even here, in the distribution of this amount, not all members agree among themselves, and everyone puts in some godmother. However, the conference now assembled was of a completely different kind: it was formed out of necessity. It was not about any poor or strangers, it concerned every official personally, it concerned the misfortune that threatened everyone anyway; therefore, involuntarily, there should be more unanimity, closer. But with all that, it turned out the devil knows what it is. Not to mention the disagreements inherent in all soviets, a kind of even incomprehensible indecision was revealed in the opinion of those assembled: one said that Chichikov was a doer of state banknotes, and then he himself added: ""or maybe not a doer""; another claimed that he was an official of the Governor-General's office, and immediately added: ""but, the devil knows, you can't read it on your forehead."" Against the guess, whether it was a robber in disguise, they all armed themselves; they found that, apart from his appearance, which in itself was already well-intentioned, there was nothing in his conversations that would show a person with violent deeds. Suddenly the postmaster, who had remained for several minutes immersed in some kind of reflection, whether it was due to a sudden inspiration that had dawned on him, or something else, suddenly cried out:","When they met at the house of the police-master, already known to the reader as the father and benefactor of the town, the officials had the opportunity of observing of each other that they had actually grown thin through all these worries and anxieties. And, indeed, the appointment of a new governor-general, and the two documents of so serious a character, and these extraordinary rumours, had, all taken together, left a perceptible imprint on their faces, and the dress-coats of some of them had become noticeably looser. Everything was changed for the worse: the president was thinner, and the inspector of the medical board was thinner, and the prosecutor was thinner, and one Semyon Ivanovitch, who was never called by his surname, and wore on his first finger a ring which he used to show to ladies —even he was thinner. Of course there were some bold spirits, as there always are, who did not lose their presence of mind; but they were not many; in fact the post master was the only one. He alone was unchanged in his invariable composure, and always when such things happened was in the habit of saying: “We know all about you governor-generals! You may be changed three or four times over, but I have been for thirty years in the same place, my good sir.” To this the other officials usually answered: “It’s all very well for you, Sprechen Sie Deutsch, Ivan Andre itch: the post office is your job—receiving and dispatching the mails; the worst you can do is to close the post office an hour too early if you are in a bad temper, or to accept a late letter from some merchant at the wrong hour, or to send off some parcel which ought not to be sent off—any one would be a saint, of course, in your place. But suppose you had the devil at your elbow every day, so that even what you don’t want to take he thrusts upon you. You have not much to fear, to be sure; you have only one son; while God has been so bountiful to Praskovya Fyodorovna, my boy, that not a year passes but she presents me with a little Praskovya or a little Petrushka; in our place, you’d sing a different tune, my boy.” So said the officials, but whether it is really possible to resist the devil it is not for the author to decide. In the council assembled on this occasion, there was a conspicuous absence of that essential thing which among the common people is called good sense. We seem somehow not made for representative institutions. In all our assemblies, from the meetings of the peasants up to all kinds of learned and other committees, there is a pretty thorough muddle, unless there is some one at the head who is managing it all. It is hard to say why it is. Apparently the nature of the Russian people is such, that the only successful committees are those formed to arrange entertainments, or dinners, such as clubs, or pleasure gardens in the German style. Yet we are always ready at any minute for anything. We fly like the wind to get up benevolent and philanthropic societies and goodness knows what. The aim may be excellent but nothing ever comes of it. Perhaps it is because we are satisfied at the very beginning and consider everything has already been done. For instance, after organising a society for the benefit of the poor, and subscribing a considerable sum, we immediately spend half of the fund subscribed on giving a dinner to all the worthies of the town in celebration of our laudable enterprise; with what is left of our funds we promptly take a grand house with heating arrangements and porters for the use of the committee; after which five roubles and a half is all that is left for the poor, and over the distribution of that sum, the members of the committee cannot agree, each one urging the claims of some crony of his own. The committee that met on this occasion was of quite another kind: it was formed through urgent necessity. It was not a question of the poor or of outsiders at all: it concerned every official personally: the occasion was a calamity which threatened all alike, and so the meeting should have been more unanimous and more united. But for all that the result was awfully queer. To say nothing of the differences of opinion that crop up at every meeting, an inexplicable indecisiveness was apparent in the views of all present; one said that Tchitchikov was a forger of government notes, and then added, “Though perhaps he isn’t a forger”; another declared that he was an official in the governor-general’s office, and at once went on, “Though the devil only knows, it is not branded on his forehead.” All were opposed to the suggestion that he was a brigand in disguise. They considered that besides his appearance, which was highly respectable, there was nothing in his conversation to suggest a man given to deeds of violence. All at once the postmaster, who had been standing for some minutes lost in meditation, cried out suddenly from some inspiration or from something else: “","On assembling at the residence indicated, the tchinovniks had occasion to remark that, owing to all these cares and excitements, every one of their number had grown thinner. Yes, the appointment of a new Governor-General, coupled with the rumours described and the reception of the two serious documents above-mentioned, had left manifest traces upon the features of every one present. More than one frockcoat had come to look too large for its wearer, and more than one frame had fallen away, including the frames of the President of the Council, the Director of the Medical Department, and the Public Prosecutor. Even a certain Semen Ivanovitch, who, for some reason or another, was never alluded to by his family name, but who wore on his index finger a ring with which he was accustomed to dazzle his lady friends, had diminished in bulk. Yet, as always happens at such junctures, there were also present a score of brazen individuals who had succeeded in NOT losing their presence of mind, even though they constituted a mere sprinkling. Of them the Postmaster formed one, since he was a man of equable temperament who could always say: “WE know you, Governor-Generals! We have seen three or four of you come and go, whereas WE have been sitting on the same stools these thirty years.” Nevertheless a prominent feature of the gathering was the total absence of what is vulgarly known as “common sense.” In general, we Russians do not make a good show at representative assemblies, for the reason that, unless there be in authority a leading spirit to control the rest, the affair always develops into confusion. Why this should be so one could hardly say, but at all events a success is scored only by such gatherings as have for their object dining and festivity—to wit, gatherings at clubs or in German-run restaurants. However, on the present occasion, the meeting was NOT one of this kind; it was a meeting convoked of necessity, and likely in view of the threatened calamity to affect every tchinovnik in the place. Also, in addition to the great divergency of views expressed thereat, there was visible in all the speakers an invincible tendency to indecision which led them at one moment to make assertions, and at the next to contradict the same. But on at least one point all seemed to agree—namely, that Chichikov’s appearance and conversation were too respectable for him to be a forger or a disguised brigand. That is to say, all SEEMED to agree on the point; until a sudden shout arose from the direction of the Postmaster, who for some time past had been sitting plunged in thought.","Having gathered at the house of the police chief, known to the reader already as the father and benefactor of the town, the officials had occasion to observe to each other that they had even grown thinner as a result of all these cares and anxieties. Indeed, the appointment of the new governor-general, and the receipt of those documents of such serious content, and those God-knows- what rumors—all this left a visible imprint on their faces, and the frock coats of many of them had become visibly looser. Everything gave way: the head magistrate got thinner, the inspector of the board of health got thinner, the prosecutor got thinner, and some Semyon Ivanovich, who was never called by his last name, and who wore on his index finger a seal ring that he used to let the ladies look at—even he got thinner. Of course, as happens everywhere, there turned up some who did not quail or lose their presence of mind, but they were very few. Just the postmaster alone. He alone was unchanged in his constantly even character and had the custom of always saying on such occasions: “We know about you, governor-general! There’s maybe three or four of you have come to replace each other, but as for me, my dear sir, I’ve been sitting in the same place for thirty years now.” To this the other officials usually observed: “That’s fine for you, Sprechen-sie-Deych Ivan Andreych, yours is a mailing business: receiving and sending correspondence; so you might cheat on occasion by locking the office an hour early, or bilk some merchant for sending a letter at the wrong time, or else send some package that oughtn’t to be sent—here, of course, anyone can be a saint. But just let the devil start turning up under your hands every day, so that you don’t want to take it, but he just sticks it there. You, naturally, couldn’t care less, you have just one boy, but we, brother, have the much-blessed Praskovya Fyodorovna, so that every year brings something: now a Praskushka, now a Petrusha—here, brother, it’s a different tune.” So spoke the officials, but whether it is indeed possible to hold out against the devil is not for the author to judge. In the council that gathered this time, the absence of that necessary thing which simple folk call sense was very noticeable. Generally we are somehow not made for representative meetings. In all our gatherings, from the peasant community level up to all possible learned and other committees, unless they have one head to control everything, there is a great deal of confusion. It is even hard to say why this is so; evidently the nation is like that, since the only meetings that succeed are those arranged for the sake of carousing or dining, to wit: clubs and all sorts of vauxhalls on a German footing.46 Yet there is a readiness for anything, you might say, at any moment. Suddenly, as the wind blows, we start societies, charitable or for the encouragement of God knows what. The goal may be beautiful, but nothing will come of it for all that. Maybe it is because we are suddenly satisfied at the very beginning, and think that everything has already been done. For instance, having started some charitable society for the poor and donated considerable sums, we at once give a dinner for all the foremost dignitaries of the town to celebrate this praiseworthy action, spending, of course, half of all the donated money on it; the rest goes straightaway to rent a splendid apartment for the committee, with heating and doorkeepers, and then there are five and a half roubles left for the poor from the entire sum, and even here not all the members agree about their distribution, and each one trots out some gammer of his own. However, the meeting that gathered this time was of a completely different sort; it was formed as a result of necessity. The matter did not concern some poor people or strangers, the matter concerned each official personally, it was the matter of a calamity that threatened them all equally; which meant that, willy-nilly, there had to be more unanimity, closeness. But, for all that, it ended with devil knows what. Not to speak of the disagreement common to all councils, the opinions of those assembled displayed some even inconceivable indecisiveness: one said that Chichikov was a forger of government banknotes, and then himself added, “ Or maybe he’s not”; another affirmed that he was an official of the governor-general’s chancellery, and immediately went on, “Though, devil knows, it’s not written on his forehead.” Against the conjecture that he was a robber in disguise, everyone rose up in arms; they found that besides an appearance that in itself was trustworthy to begin with, there was nothing in his conversation to suggest a man of violent behavior. All at once the postmaster, who had stood for a few moments immersed in some reflection, cried out unexpectedly, either as a result of a sudden inspiration that visited him, or something else:","Having gathered at the house of the Chief of Police, the father and benefactor of the town with whom the reader is already acquainted, the officials had an opportunity to remark to one another that they had actually lost weight because of all these worries and alarums. And truly, the appointment of a new Governor-General, as well as the recent receipt of those documents the contents of which were of so serious a character, and all those rumors the nature of which God alone knew, had all left perceptible traces upon their countenances, while the frock coats upon many of them had become perceptibly roomier. Everybody there showed signs of wear and tear. The Chairman of the Administrative Offices had lost weight, and the Inspector of the Board of Health had lost weight, and the Public Prosecutor had lost weight, and a certain Semion Ivanovich, who was never called by his last name and who wore upon his right index finger a ring which he always permitted the ladies to examine, well, even he had lost weight. Of course, as is generally the case, there were to be found some courageous spirits who had not lost their presence of mind, but they were far from many—as a matter of fact there was only one: the Postmaster. He alone did not change; his character remained as imperturbable and tranquil as ever. Whenever such occasions as the present arose, it was his wont to remark: “ We know all about you Governors-General! There will be three or four of you replacing one another; but it’s thirty years by now, my dear sir, that I’m doing business at the same old stand.” To which the other officials would usually remark: “It’s all very well for you to talk, Sprechen Sie Deutsch, Ivan Andreich. Your work has to do with the mail, receiving it and dispatching it. All the monkey business you can do is to close the post office an hour earlier, maybe, or accept a little something from a belated merchant for taking a letter outside of regular hours, or you may forward a parcel or two that shouldn’t be forwarded. In a case like that, naturally, any man would be a saint. But suppose the Devil took to turning up at your elbow day after day, so that, even though you didn’t want to take anything, he persisted in thrusting temptation upon you. You, of course, haven’t much to worry you—all you’ve got is one little boy—but in my case, brother, my Praskovia Fedorovna has been endowed by God with such a blessed fertility that not a year passes without her bringing forth either a Praskushka or a Petrushka. In a case like that, brother, you’d strike up a different tune.” Thus did the officials discourse; but whether it’s really possible to withstand the Devil or not is not an author’s business to judge. In the council now convened there was a very noticeable absence of that indispensable something which among the common folk is called horse sense. In general we Russians haven’t, somehow, been created for representative bodies. In all our assemblies, beginning with the village meeting of the peasants and going all the way up to all possible sorts of learned committees and the like, a most impressive confusion will prevail if they lack a single leader who directs everything. It’s difficult to say why this is so; evidently it must be so because we’re that sort of folk. Only those conferences succeed which are undertaken with the ultimate goal of having a good time or a banquet, such organizations as clubs and all kinds of vauxhall pleasure gardens, patterned after the German style. But as for willingness, it’s on tap at a moment’s notice and for any purpose you will. We will, at the drop of a hat and with all the consistency of a weather-vane, launch societies for philanthropic purposes, for the encouragement of this and that, and for Heaven alone knows what else. The purpose will, every time, be splendid and beautiful, but with all that, nothing will come of it. Perhaps this is due to the fact that we become quickly satisfied at the very beginning and consider that everything has already been accomplished. For instance, having got up some society for the benefit of the poor and duly contributed considerable sums, we will immediately, to mark the occasion of so praiseworthy a deed, launch a banquet for all the leading dignitaries of the town, which banquet, in the nature of things, will eat up half the sums received; with the remaining funds, magnificent quarters will be promptly rented for the committee, complete with the latest heating arrangements and all sorts of attendants. And, in the upshot, there remains for the poor all of five rubles and a half, but even then the members of the committee aren’t in full accord as to the disposition of this sum, and each one proposes as the recipient some worthy person who had been godmother to his child. However, the conference now convened was of an entirely different kind—it had been called out of sheer necessity. It wasn’t with any poor folk or outsiders that it had to deal; it had to deal with matters that affected each one of the officials personally. It had to deal with a peril that threatened all of them alike; therefore, willy-nilly, the conference had to attain as much unanimity and camaraderie as possible. But, for all that, the result was the Devil knows what. To say nothing of the differences of opinion natural to all councils, a hesitancy that was downright incomprehensible was revealed about the views of those gathered here. One would say that Chichikov was a forger of government notes and would then himself add: “ And maybe he isn’t, at that.” Another maintained that our hero was an official from the chancellery of the Governor-General and then immediately tacked on: “ And yet, the Devil knows what he is; you can’t read anything on his forehead.” Against the conjecture whether he mightn’t be a brigand in disguise, all rose up in arms; they found that, outside of his appearance, which attested to his good intentions per se, there was nothing in his conversation that in any way betokened a man of violent deeds. Suddenly the Postmaster, who for several minutes had been plunged in some sort of meditation, moved by some sudden inspiration or by something else, cried out unexpectedly: “Do you know, gentlemen, who this Chichikov is?”"
"— Это — другое дело, Афанасий Васильевич. Я это делаю для спасения души, потому что в убеждении, что этим хоть сколько-нибудь заглажу праздную жизнь, что как я ни дурен, но молитвы все-таки что-нибудь значат у бога. Скажу вам, что я молюсь, — даже и без веры, но все-таки молюсь. Слышится только, что есть господин, от которого все зависит, как лошадь и скотина, которою пашем, знает чутьем того, кто запрягает.","“That's another matter, Afanasy Vasilyevich. I do this to save my soul, because I am convinced that by doing this I will at least a little make amends for an idle life, that no matter how bad I am, prayers still mean something to God.

One only hears that there is a master on whom everything depends, like the horse and cattle that we plow, knows by instinct the one who harnesses.","“That is a different matter, Afanasy Vassilyevitch.

I tell you that I pray, without faith,—but still I pray. I have a feeling that there is a Master on whom everything depends, just as horses and cattle feel they have a rightful master.”","Otherwise they will be ruined. Do not think that I am jesting.

"Платон Михалыч Платонов был Ахиллес и Парид[36] вместе: стройное сложенье, картинный рост, свежесть — все было собрано в нем. Приятная усмешка с легким выраженьем иронии как бы еще усиливала его красоту. Но, несмотря на все это, было в нем что-то неоживленное и сонное. Страсти, печали и потрясения не навели морщины на девственное, свежее его лицо, но с тем вместе и не оживили его.","Platon Mikhalych Platonov was Achilles and Parides[36] together: a slender build, picturesque growth, freshness - everything was collected in him. A pleasant smile with a slight expression of irony, as it were, further enhanced his beauty. But in spite of all this, there was something inanimate and sleepy about him. Passions, sorrows and shocks did not wrinkle his virginal, fresh face, but at the same time they did not revive him.","Platon Mihailovitch Platonov was an Achillesem and Parisen in one, a graceful figure, picturesque height, freshness—everything was combined in him. A pleasant smile with a faint expression of irony, as it were, accentuated his beauty, but, in spite of all that, there was something lifeless and drowsy about him.

Passions, sorrows, and shocks had brought no wrinkles to his virginal, fresh face, nor at the same time did they animate it.",

You see, they must have instruction in God’s word, and also lessons in music and dancing; and not for love or money can these things be procured in the country.","“No little estate, but I’ll move to town. That had to be done in any case, not for ourselves but for the children. They’ll need teachers of catechism, music, dance. One can’t get that in the country.”",

"— Но все же таки… но как же таки… как же запропастить себя в деревне? Какое же общество может быть между мужичьем? Здесь все-таки на улице попадется навстречу генерал или князь. Захочешь — и сам пройдешь каких-нибудь публичных красивых зданий, на Неву пойдешь взглянуть, а ведь там, что ни попадется, все это или мужик, или баба. За что ж себя осудить на невежество на всю жизнь свою?","- But still ... but how ... how can you lose yourself in the village? What kind of society can there be between men? Here, after all, on the street you will meet a general or a prince. If you want, you yourself will go through some beautiful public buildings, you will go to look at the Neva, and after all, whatever you come across is either a man or a woman. Why condemn yourself to ignorance for the rest of your life?","After a moment’s reflection he began after this style: “But all the same ... however can you? ... How can you vegetate in the country? What society will you have among peasants?

Why condemn yourself to rustic ignorance all your life?”","“Yes, but, but— but how can a man like you retire to rustication in the country? What society will you get there? Here one meets at least a general or a prince sometimes; indeed, no matter whom you pass in the street, that person represents gas lamps and European civilisation; but in the country, no matter what part of it you are in, not a soul is to be encountered save muzhiks and their women. Why should you go and condemn yourself to a state of vegetation like that?”","“But all the same … all the same … why go perish yourself in the country? What sort of society is there among muzhiks?

"Чичиков схватился со стула с ловкостью почти военного человека, подлетел к хозяйке с мягким выраженьем в улыбке деликатного штатского человека, коромыслом подставил ей руку и повел ее парадно через две комнаты в столовую, сохраняя во все время приятное наклоненье головы несколько набок. Служитель снял крышку с суповой чашки; все со стульями придвинулись ближе к столу, и началось хлебанье супа.","Chichikov grabbed himself from his chair with the dexterity of an almost military man, flew up to the hostess with a mild expression in the smile of a delicate civilian, offered her his arm with a yoke, and led her through two rooms to the dining room, keeping his head pleasantly inclined a little to one side. The attendant removed the lid from the soup cup; everyone with chairs moved closer to the table, and the slurping of soup began.","Tchitchikov leaped up from his chair with the agility of a military man; he flew up to the lady with a soft expression, with the politeness of a refined civilian made his arm into a loop, offered it to her and led her in state across two rooms to the dining-room, keeping his head agreeably on one side all the time. The servant took the cover off the soup tureen; they all moved their chairs nearer to the table and began upon the soup.","Chichikov sprang up with the alacrity of a military man, offered her his arm, and escorted her, as on parade, to the dining-room, where awaiting them there was the soup-toureen. From it the lid had just been removed, and the room was redolent of the fragrant odour of early spring roots and herbs. The company took their seats, and at once the servants placed the remainder of the dishes (under covers) upon the table and withdrew, for Kostanzhoglo hated to have servants listening to their employers’ conversation, and objected still more to their staring at him all the while that he was eating.","Chichikov popped up from his chair with the adroitness of an almost military man, flew over to the mistress with the soft expression of a delicate civilian in his smile, offered her the crook of his arm, and led her gala-fashion through two rooms into the dining room, all the while keeping his head agreeably inclined a bit to one side.

"В передней не дали даже и опомниться ему. «Ступайте! вас князь уже ждет», — сказал дежурный чиновник. Перед ним, как в тумане, мелькнула передняя с курьерами, принимавшими пакеты, потом зала, через которую он прошел, думая только: «Вот как схватит, да без суда, без всего, прямо в Сибирь!» Сердце его забилось с такой силою, с какой не бьется даже у наиревнивейшего любовника. Наконец растворилась пред ним дверь: предстал кабинет, с портфелями, шкафами и книгами, и князь гневный, как сам гнев.","In the front they didn't even let him come to his senses. “Go! the prince is already waiting for you, ”said the official on duty. In front of him, as if in a fog, flashed the hall with the couriers who received the packages, then the hall through which he passed, thinking only: “This is how he will seize, but without trial, without anything, straight to Siberia!” His heart began to beat with such force that even the most jealous lover does not beat. Finally, the door opened before him: an office appeared, with briefcases, cabinets and books, and the prince was angry, like anger itself.","They did not even let him get his breath in the hall. “Go in! the prince is expecting you,” said the clerk on duty. He caught glimpses, as through a mist, of the hall with the couriers receiving envelopes, then of a big room which he crossed, thinking: “This is how men are seized and without trial, without anything, sent straight to Siberia.” His heart beat more violently than the most passionate lover’s. At last a door was thrown open before him: and he was confronted with a study, with portfolios, shelves and books, and the prince, the embodiment of anger.","And even in the hall of that establishment no time was given him to pull himself together, for at once an aide-de-camp said: “Go inside immediately, for the Prince is awaiting you.” And as in a dream did our hero see a vestibule where couriers were being handed dispatches, and then a salon which he crossed with the thought, “I suppose I am not to be allowed a trial, but shall be sent straight to Siberia!” And at the thought his heart started beating in a manner which the most jealous of lovers could not have rivalled. At length there opened a door, and before him he saw a study full of portfolios, ledgers, and dispatch-boxes, with, standing behind them, the gravely menacing figure of the Prince.","In the anteroom he was not even allowed to come to his senses. “Go in! The prince is waiting for you,” said the official on duty. Before him as through a mist flashed the anteroom with messengers receiving packages, then a hall through which he passed, thinking only: “ He’ll just up and seize me, and with no trial, no anything—straight to Siberia!” His heart began to pound harder than the heart of the most jealous lover. The door finally opened: before him was the office, with portfolios, shelves, books, and the prince as wrathful as wrath itself.",
"— Очень не дрянь, — сказал Чичиков, пожав ему руку. Здесь был испущен очень глубокий вздох. Казалось, он был настроен к сердечным излияниям; не без чувства и выражения произнес он наконец следующие слова: — Если б вы знали, какую услугу оказали сей, по-видимому, дрянью человеку без племени и роду! Да и действительно, чего не потерпел я? как барка какая-нибудь среди свирепых волн… Каких гонений, каких преследований не испытал, какого горя не вкусил, а за что? за то, что соблюдал правду, что был чист на своей совести, что подавал руку и вдовице беспомощной, и сироте-горемыке!.. — Тут даже он отер платком выкатившуюся слезу.","""Don't be very rubbish,"" said Chichikov, shaking his hand. Here a very deep sigh was let out. He seemed to be in the mood for outpourings of the heart; not without feeling and expression, he finally uttered the following words: “If you only knew what service you rendered to this, apparently, rubbish, to a man without tribe and family!” And indeed, what did I not tolerate? like some kind of barge among the ferocious waves ... What kind of persecution, what persecution did not experience, what grief did not taste, but for what? for keeping the truth, for being pure in his conscience, for giving a hand to both the helpless widow and the miserable orphan!","“Not worthless at all,” said Tchitchikov, pressing his hand. At this point a very deep sigh escaped him. It seemed that he was inclined to pour out his heart; not without feeling and expression, he uttered at last the following words: “If only you knew the service that with those apparently worthless souls you are doing to a man of no rank or family! What have I not suffered indeed! Like some ship on the stormy waves... what ill-usage, what persecution have I not endured, what grief have I not known! And for what? For having followed the path of justice, for being true to my conscience, for giving a helping hand to the forlorn widow and orphan in distress! ...” At this point he actually wiped away a tear with his handkerchief","“Not at all,” replied Chichikov, pressing his hand; after which he heaved a profound sigh. Indeed, he seemed in the right mood for outpourings of the heart, for he continued—not without a ring of emotion in his tone: “If you but knew the service which you have rendered to an apparently insignificant individual who is devoid both of family and kindred! For what have I not suffered in my time—I, a drifting barque amid the tempestuous billows of life? What harryings, what persecutions, have I not known? Of what grief have I not tasted? And why? Simply because I have ever kept the truth in view, because ever I have preserved inviolate an unsullied conscience, because ever I have stretched out a helping hand to the defenceless widow and the hapless orphan!” After which outpouring Chichikov pulled out his handkerchief, and wiped away a brimming tear.","“By no means trash,” said Chichikov, pressing his hand. Here a very profound sigh was emitted. It seemed he was in the mood for outpourings of the heart; not without feeling and expression he finally uttered the following words: “If you only knew what a service you have just rendered, with this ostensible trash, to a man without kith or kin! Yes, really and truly, is there anything I have not suffered? like some bark amidst the savage waves … How persecuted, how victimized I have been, what grief I have tasted, and for what? for having observed the truth, for being of pure conscience, for holding my hand out to the helpless widow and the hapless orphan!… ” At this point he even wiped away an impending tear with his handkerchief.","“They are far from being trash,” said Chichikov, squeezing Manilov’s hand. At this point a very deep sigh escaped him. He was, it seemed, in a mood for heartfelt effusions; it was not without feeling and expressiveness that he uttered, at last , the following words: “If you but knew what a service you have rendered by giving this apparent trash to a man of no lineage or breeding! And really, what haven’t I endured? Like some bark or other, tossed amid the ferocious waves.... What oppressions, what persecutions have I not experienced, what woe have I not tasted of. And for what? For that I kept to the ways of righteousness, for that my conscience was clear, for that I extended the helping hand both to the homeless widow and to the poor, wretched orphan! ...” At this point he himself had to dab away with his handkerchief at a tear that coursed down his cheek."
"— Эхе-хе! что ж ты? — сказал Чичиков Селифану, — ты?","— Ehehe! what are you? Chichikov said to Selifan, ""you?""","“Hey, hey!

"— Да если вам свободно, так поедем со мной, — сказал Чичиков и подумал про себя, глядя на Платонова: «А это было бы хорошо: тогда бы можно издержки пополам, а подчинку коляски отнести вовсе на его счет».","“Yes, if it’s free for you, then let’s go with me,” said Chichikov and thought to himself, looking at Platonov: “And that would be good: then the costs could be halved, and the subordination of the carriage could be attributed entirely to his account.”","“Why if you are free, come with me,” said Tchitchikov, and to himself he thought, looking at Platonov, “and that would be a good thing, we could go halves over the expenses; and the repair of the carriage I could put down entirely to him.”","“Well, should it so please you, you might join me as my companion.” This said, the speaker added to himself as he eyed Platon: “Yes, that would suit me exactly, for then I should have half my expenses paid, and could charge him also with the cost of mending the koliaska.”","“If you’re free, then come with me,” said Chichikov, thinking to himself as he looked at Platonov: “And it would be nice: we could split the expenses, and the repairs of the carriage could go entirely to his account.”",
"— А Чичикова, ваше сиятельство, прикажите отпустить.","- And Chichikov, your Excellency, order to release.","“And bid them release Tchitchikov, your Excellency.”","“Also, I should order Chichikov to leave the town,” suggested Murazov.","“And order Chichikov’s release, Your Excellency.”",
"— А вот я и здесь! — раздался голос сбоку. Чичиков оглянулся. Барин уже ехал возле него, одетый, на дрожках — травяно-зеленый нанковый сюртук, желтые штаны и шея без галстука, на манер купидона! Боком сидел он на дрожках, занявши собою все дрожки. Чичиков хотел было что-то сказать ему, но толстяк уже исчез. Дрожки показались на другой стороне, и только слышался голос: «Щуку и семь карасей отнесите повару-телепню, а осетра подавай сюда: я его свезу сам на дрожках». Раздались снова голоса: «Фома Большой да Фома Меньшой! Козьма да Денис!» Когда же подъехал он к крыльцу дома, к величайшему изумленью его, толстый барин был уже на крыльце и принял его в свои объятья. Как он успел слетать, было непостижимо. Они поцеловались троекратно навкрест.","- And here I am! came a voice from the side. Chichikov looked around. The master was already riding beside him, dressed in a droshky - a grass-green nanke frock coat, yellow trousers and a neck without a tie, in the manner of a Cupid! He sat sideways on the droshky, occupying all the droshky with himself. Chichikov was about to say something to him, but the fat man had already disappeared. Drozhki appeared on the other side, and only a voice was heard: “Take the pike and seven crucian carp to the telepnik cook, and serve the sturgeon here: I’ll take it myself on the droshky.” Voices were heard again: “Thomas the Great and Thomas the Lesser! Kozma and Denis! When he drove up to the porch of the house, to his great amazement, the fat gentleman was already on the porch and received him in his arms. How he managed to fly was incomprehensible. They kissed three times.","“Well, here I am again,” cried a voice from one side. Tchitchikov looked round and saw that the stout gentleman was already driving in a droshky beside him, clothed—a grass-green nankeenel coat, yellow breeches, and a bare neck without a cravat like a Cupid. He was sitting sideways on the droshky, which he completely filled. Tchitchikov was about to say something to him, but the fat man had already vanished. The droshky appeared on the other side and the voice rang out again: “ Take the pike and the seven crucians to my booby the cook, but hand me the sturgeon here; I’ll take it myself on the droshky.” Again there were shouts: “Big Foma and Little Foma, Kozma and Denis!” When Tchitchikov drove up to the front door, to his intense astonishment the fat gentleman was already on the steps, and received him with open arms. It was inconceivable how he could have managed to fly there in the time. They kissed each other three times, first on one cheek and then on the other.","“A queer fellow, that Koshkarev!” said Chichikov to himself. “Well, whatever I may be, at least I’m here,” said a voice by his side. Chichikov looked round, and perceived that, in the meanwhile, the barin had dressed himself and overtaken the carriage. With a pair of yellow trousers he was wearing a grass-green jacket, and his neck was as guiltless of a collar as Cupid’s. Also, as he sat sideways in his drozhki, his bulk was such that he completely filled the vehicle. Chichikov was about to make some remark or another when the stout gentleman disappeared; and presently his drozhki re-emerged into view at the spot where the fish had been drawn to land, and his voice could be heard reiterating exhortations to his serfs. Yet when Chichikov reached the verandah of the house he found, to his intense surprise, the stout gentleman waiting to welcome the visitor. How he had contrived to convey himself thither passed Chichikov’s comprehension. Host and guest embraced three times, according to a bygone custom of Russia. Evidently the barin was one of the old school.","“And here I am!” a voice came from the side. Chichikov looked around. The squire was already driving along next to him, clothed, in a droshky—grass-green nankeen frock coat, yellow trousers, and a neck without a tie, after the manner of a cupid! He was sitting sideways on the droshky, taking up the whole droshky with himself. Chichikov was about to say something to him, but the fat man had already vanished. The droshky appeared on the other side, and all that was heard was a voice: “Take the pike and seven carp to that dolt of a cook, and fetch the sturgeon here: I’ll take him myself in the droshky.” Again came voices: “Big Foma and Little Foma! Kozma and Denis!” And when he drove up to the porch of the house, to his greatest amazement the fat squire was already standing there and received him into his embrace. How he had managed to fly there was inconceivable. They kissed each other three times crisscross.",
"Эту-то науку жизни сделал он предметом отдельного курса воспитания, в который поступали только одни самые отличные. Малоспособных выпускал он на службу из первого курса, утверждая, что их не нужно много мучить: довольно с них, если приучились быть терпеливыми, работящими исполнителями, не приобретая заносчивости и всяких видов вдаль. «Но с умниками, но с даровитыми мне нужно долго повозиться», — обыкновенно говорил он. И становился в этом курсе совершенно другой Александр Петрович и с первых же раз возвещал, что доселе он требовал от них простого ума, теперь потребует ума высшего. Не того ума, который умеет подтрунить над дураком и посмеяться, но умеющего вынесть всякое оскорбление, спустить дураку — и не раздражиться. Здесь-то стал он требовать того, что другие требуют от детей. Это-то называл он высшей степенью ума. Сохранить посреди каких бы то ни было огорчений высокий покой, в котором вечно должен пребывать человек, — вот что называл он умом! В этом-то курсе Александр Петрович показал, что знает, точно, науку жизни. Из наук были избраны только те, которые способны образовать из человека гражданина земли своей. Большая часть лекций состояла в рассказах о том, что ожидает впереди человека на всех поприщах и ступенях государственной службы и частных занятий. Все огорченья и преграды, какие только воздвигаются человеку на пути его, все искушенья и соблазны, ему предстоящие, собирал он перед ними во всей наготе, не скрывая ничего. Все было ему известно, точно как бы перебыл он сам во всех званьях и должностях. Словом, чертил он перед ними вовсе не радужную будущность. Странное дело! оттого ли, что честолюбие уже так сильно было в них возбуждено; оттого ли, что в самых глазах необыкновенного наставника было что-то говорящее юноше: вперед! — это слово, производящее такие чудеса над русским человеком, — то ли, другое ли, но юноша с самого начала искал только трудностей, алча действовать только там, где трудно, где нужно было показать большую силу души. Было что-то трезвое в их жизни. Александр Петрович делал с ними всякие опыты и пробы, наносил им то сам чувствительные оскорбления, то посредством их же товарищей, но, проникнувши это, они становились еще осторожней. Из этого курса вышло немного, но эти немногие были крепыши, были обкуренные порохом люди. В службе они удержались на самых шатких местах, тогда как многие, гораздо их умнейшие, не вытерпев, бросили службу из-за мелочных личных неприятностей, бросили вовсе, или же, не ведая ничего, очутились в руках взяточников и плутов. Но воспитанные Александром Петровичем не только не пошатнулись, но, умудренные познаньем человека и души, возымели высокое нравственное влияние даже на взяточников и дурных людей.","He made this science of life the subject of a separate course of education, in which only the most excellent entered. He released the incapable to serve from the first year, arguing that they did not need to be tortured much: it was enough for them if they had learned to be patient, hard-working performers, without acquiring arrogance and all sorts of distant views. “But with smart people, but with gifted ones, I need to tinker for a long time,” he usually said. And in this course Alexander Petrovich became completely different, and from the very first time he announced that hitherto he had demanded a simple mind from them, now he would demand a higher mind. Not the mind that knows how to make fun of a fool and laugh, but that knows how to endure any insult, let the fool down - and not be irritated. Here he began to demand what others demand from children. This is what he called the highest degree of intelligence. To preserve, in the midst of any kind of affliction, the high peace in which a person must remain forever - that's what he called the mind! In this course, Alexander Petrovich showed that he knew, for sure, the science of life. Of the sciences, only those were chosen that are capable of shaping a man into a citizen of his land. Most of the lectures consisted of stories about what lies ahead for a person in all fields and levels of public service and private studies. All the sorrows and obstacles that are only erected to a person on his way, all the temptations and temptations that are coming to him, he gathered before them in all nakedness, not hiding anything. Everything was known to him, just as if he himself had been in all ranks and positions. In a word, he did not draw a bright future for them at all. Strange affair! Is it because ambition was already so strongly aroused in them; Was it because in the very eyes of the extraordinary mentor there was something saying to the young man: forward! - this is a word that works such miracles on a Russian person - whether it’s one or the other, but the young man from the very beginning was looking for only difficulties, eager to act only where it was difficult, where it was necessary to show great strength of the soul. There was something sober in their lives. Alexander Petrovich made all sorts of experiments and tests with them, inflicted on them either himself sensitive insults, or through their own comrades, but, having penetrated this, they became even more cautious. Not much came out of this course, but these few were strong men, they were people stoned with gunpowder. In the service, they held on to the most shaky places, while many, much smarter than them, could not bear it, left the service due to petty personal troubles, left them altogether, or, knowing nothing, found themselves in the hands of bribe-takers and rogues. But those brought up by Alexander Petrovich not only did not waver, but, wiser in the knowledge of man and the soul, they had a high moral influence even on bribe-takers and bad people.","This science of life he made into a separate course of study to which only the most promising of his pupils were admitted. The less gifted boys he allowed to enter the government service straight from the first class, saying it was no use to worry them too much: it was enough for them if they learnt to be patient and diligent workers free from conceit and ulterior motives. “But the clever boys, the gifted boys, keep me busy a long time,” he used to say, and in this last course Alexandr Petrovitch became a different man, and from the first informed them that he had hitherto expected only simple intelligence, but that now he would expect from them a higher intelligence, not the intelligence that can jeer and mock at fools, but that which can bear every insult, and suffer fools without irritation. At this stage he required from them what others require from children. That he called the highest stage of intelligence. To preserve in the midst of any troubles that lofty calm in which man ought to dwell for ever—that was what he called intelligence. In this course Alexandr Petrovitch showed that he did understand the science of life. Of subjects only those were selected for study which were calculated to turn a man into a true citizen. A great part of the lectures consisted of descriptions of what lay before them in various careers, in the government service or in private callings. He laid before them in all their nakedness, concealing nothing, all the mortifications and obstacles which would confront a man on his path through life, all the dangers and temptations that would beset him. He knew all about them as though he himself had practised every calling and held every office. In fact he pictured anything but a joyful future. Strange to say, either because ambition had already been aroused in them, or because there was something in the very eye of that exceptional teacher that uttered the word, forward!—that marvellous word that works such miracles with the Russian—these lads actually sought positions of difficulty, thirsting for action just where action was hardest, where there was need to show a stout heart. There was a kind of sobriety in their lives. Alexandr Petrovitch put them to all sorts of proofs and tests, inflicted on them painful mortifications by his own action and also through their schoolfellows; but seeing through it they were all the more on their guard. Those who passed through the course were few in number, but those few were strong men, were like men who had been through fire. In the service they kept their footing even in the most precarious position when many others, cleverer perhaps than they, could not hold out, but gave up the service on account of the most trivial annoyances, or without being aware of it got into the hands of rogues and bribe-takers. But Alexandr Petrovitch’s pupils did not merely hold on steadily but, trained in the knowledge of man and nature, exerted a lofty influence, even upon the corrupt and the depraved.","“But no,” he would reply. “Not at all. You see, I make it my principle to keep the incapables for a single term only, since that is enough for them; but to the clever ones I allot a double course of instruction.” And, true enough, any lad of brains was retained for this finishing course. Yet he did not repress all boyish playfulness, since he declared it to be as necessary as a rash to a doctor, inasmuch as it enabled him to diagnose what lay hidden within. Consequently, how the boys loved him! Never was there such an attachment between master and pupils. And even later, during the foolish years, when foolish things attract, the measure of affection which Alexander Petrovitch retained was extraordinary. In fact, to the day of his death, every former pupil would celebrate the birthday of his late master by raising his glass in gratitude to the mentor dead and buried—then close his eyelids upon the tears which would come trickling through them. Even the slightest word of encouragement from Alexander Petrovitch could throw a lad into a transport of tremulous joy, and arouse in him an honourable emulation of his fellows. Boys of small capacity he did not long retain in his establishment; whereas those who possessed exceptional talent he put through an extra course of schooling. This senior class—a class composed of specially-selected pupils—was a very different affair from what usually obtains in other colleges. Only when a boy had attained its ranks did Alexander demand of him what other masters indiscreetly require of mere infants—namely the superior frame of mind which, while never indulging in mockery, can itself bear ridicule, and disregard the fool, and keep its temper, and repress itself, and eschew revenge, and calmly, proudly retain its tranquillity of soul. In short, whatever avails to form a boy into a man of assured character, that did Alexander Petrovitch employ during the pupil’s youth, as well as constantly put him to the test. How well he understood the art of life! Of assistant tutors he kept but few, since most of the necessary instruction he imparted in person, and, without pedantic terminology and inflated diction and views, could so transmit to his listeners the inmost spirit of a lesson that even the youngest present absorbed its essential elements. Also, of studies he selected none but those which may help a boy to become a good citizen; and therefore most of the lectures which he delivered consisted of discourses on what may be awaiting a youth, as well as of such demarcations of life’s field that the pupil, though seated, as yet, only at the desk, could beforehand bear his part in that field both in thought and spirit. Nor did the master CONCEAL anything. That is to say, without mincing words, he invariably set before his hearers the sorrows and the difficulties which may confront a man, the trials and the temptations which may beset him. And this he did in terms as though, in every possible calling and capacity, he himself had experienced the same. Consequently, either the vigorous development of self-respect or the constant stimulus of the master’s eye (which seemed to say to the pupil, “Forward!”—that word which has become so familiar to the contemporary Russian, that word which has worked such wonders upon his sensitive temperament); one or the other, I repeat, would from the first cause the pupil to tackle difficulties, and only difficulties, and to hunger for prowess only where the path was arduous, and obstacles were many, and it was necessary to display the utmost strength of mind. Indeed, few completed the course of which I have spoken without issuing therefrom reliable, seasoned fighters who could keep their heads in the most embarrassing of official positions, and at times when older and wiser men, distracted with the annoyances of life, had either abandoned everything or, grown slack and indifferent, had surrendered to the bribe-takers and the rascals. In short, no ex-pupil of Alexander Petrovitch ever wavered from the right road, but, familiar with life and with men, armed with the weapons of prudence, exerted a powerful influence upon wrongdoers.","This science of life he made the subject of a separate course of study, to which he admitted only the most excellent. Those of small ability he let go into government service after the first year, maintaining that there was no need to torment them too much: it was enough for them if they learned to be patient, industrious workers, without acquiring presumptuousness or any long-range views. “But with the clever ones, the gifted ones, I must take a lot more trouble,” he used to say. And in this course he became a totally different Alexander Petrovich, who from the first announced to them that so far he had demanded simple intelligence from them, but now he would demand a higher intelligence. Not the intelligence that knows how to taunt a fool and laugh at him, but one that knows how to endure any insult, ignore the fool—and not become irritated. It was here that he started to demand what others demand of children. It was this that he called the highest degree of intelligence! To preserve the lofty calm in which man must abide eternally amid any griefs whatever—it was this that he called intelligence! It was in this course that Alexander Petrovich showed that he indeed knew the science of life. Of subjects those alone were selected which were able to form a man into a citizen of his country. The majority of the lectures consisted of accounts of what lay ahead for a man in all careers and steps of government service and private occupations. All the troubles and obstacles that could be set up on a man’s path, all the temptations and seductions lying in wait for him, he gathered before them in all their nakedness, concealing nothing. Everything was known to him, just as if he himself had filled every rank and post. In short, what he outlined for them was not at all a bright future. Strangely enough, whether because ambition was already so strongly awakened in them, or because there was something in the very eyes of their extraordinary mentor that said to a young man: Forward!—that word which produces such miracles in the Russian man—in any case, the young men sought only difficulties from the very start, longing to act only where it was difficult, where one had to show great strength of soul. There was something sober in their life. Alexander Petrovich did all sorts of experiments and tests with them, inflicting palpable insults on them either himself or by means of their comrades, but, perceiving as much, they would become still more prudent. Few finished this course, but those few were stalwarts, people who had been under fire. In the service they held out in the most unstable posts, while many far more intelligent men, not able to endure, quit the service on account of petty personal troubles, quit altogether, or, quite unawares, wound up in the hands of bribe takers and crooks. But those educated by Alexander Petrovich not only did not waver, but, wise in their knowledge of man and the soul, acquired a lofty moral influence even over the bribe takers and bad people.",

"— О, вы еще не знаете его, — отвечал Манилов, у него чрезвычайно много остроумия. Вот меньшой, Алкид, тот не так быстр, а этот сейчас, если что-нибудь встретит, букашку, козявку, так уж у него вдруг глазенки и забегают; побежит за ней следом и тотчас обратит внимание. Я его прочу по дипломатической части. Фемистоклюс, — продолжал он, снова обратясь к нему, — хочешь быть посланником?","""Oh, you don't know him yet,"" answered Manilov, he has an extraordinary amount of wit. Here is the smaller one, Alkid, that one is not so fast, but this one now, if he meets something, a bug, a goat, his eyes suddenly start to run; will run after her and immediately pay attention. I will read it on the diplomatic side. Themistoclus,” he continued, turning to him again, “do you want to be a messenger?","“Oh, you don’t know him yet,” answered Manilov, “he has a very keen wit. The younger now, Alkides,z is not so quick, but this fellow if he comes upon anything such as a beetle or a lady-bird, his eyes are racing after it at once; he runs after it and notices it directly. I intend him for the diplomatic service. Themistoclus,“ he went on, addressing the boy again, ”would you like to be an ambassador?“","“You do not know him fully,” replied the delighted Manilov. “The amount of sharpness which he possesses is extraordinary. Our younger one, Alkid, is not so quick; whereas his brother—well, no matter what he may happen upon (whether upon a cowbug or upon a water-beetle or upon anything else), his little eyes begin jumping out of his head, and he runs to catch the thing, and to inspect it. For HIM I am reserving a diplomatic post. Themistocleus,” added the father, again turning to his son, “do you wish to become an ambassador?”","“Oh, you still don’t know him,” responded Manilov, “he has an exceeding amount of wit. The younger one now, Alkides, this one is not so quick, but that one, as soon as he meets something, a bug or a gnat, his eyes suddenly start rolling; he runs after it and investigates it at once. I intend him for the diplomatic line. Themistoclus,” he went on, again addressing the boy, “want to be an ambassador?”","“Oh, you don’t know him yet!” Manilov responded. “He has an extremely keen wit. You take the younger, Alcides, he isn’t so apt; whereas this little chap, the minute he comes across anything—some tiny insect, some little bug—why, his eyes simply light up all of a sudden and start darting to and fro; he’ll run after it and draw your attention to it at once. I intend to have him go into the diplomatic corps. Themistoclius,” he went on, turning to the boy anew, “do you want to be an ambassador?”"
"В лице его заметно было расстройство. Почтенный купец немецкого выговора был тот же час выслан, и они остались одни.","Disappointment was evident in his face. The venerable merchant with a German accent was expelled the same hour, and they were left alone.","His face looked troubled. The worthy dealer with the German accent was at once dismissed, and they were left alone.","“Never mind, never mind; it is nothing,” said Chichikov as he strove to communicate to his features as cheerful an expression as possible.","One could see by his face that he was upset. The worthy merchant of German enunciation was sent out at once, and they were left alone.",
"— Что? — спросил Чичиков, смутившись.","- What? Chichikov asked, embarrassed.","“What?” asked Tchitchikov, embarrassed.","For my own part, I could desire nothing better than this quiet life in the country.” “Let me guess what is in your mind,” said Pietukh. “What, then?” asked Chichikov, rather taken aback.","“What?” asked Chichikov, embarrassed.",
"— Константин! пора вставать, — сказала хозяйка, приподнявшись со стула. Платонов приподнялся, Костанжогло приподнялся, Чичиков приподнялся, хотя хотелось ему все сидеть да слушать. Подставив руку коромыслом, повел он обратно хозяйку. Но голова его не была склонена приветливо набок, недоставало ловкости в его оборотах, потому что мысли были заняты существенными оборотами и соображениями.","- Konstantin! it’s time to get up,” said the hostess, rising from her chair. Platonov got up, Kostanjoglo got up, Chichikov got up, although he wanted to sit and listen to everything. Substituting his hand with a yoke, he led the hostess back. But his head was not bowed amiably to one side, there was a lack of dexterity in his turns, because his thoughts were occupied with essential turns and considerations.","“Konstantin, it is time to get up,” said his wife, getting up from the table. Platonov rose, Skudronzhoglo got up, Tchitchikov got up, though he would have liked to go on sitting still and listening. Making a loop of his arm, Tchitchikov led the lady of the house back. But his head was not ingratiatingly on one side and there was not the same sprightly politeness in his movements. His mind was absorbed in more substantial movements and considerations.","“Constantine, it is time to leave the table,” said the lady of the house, rising from her seat. Every one followed her example, and Chichikov once again acted as his hostess’s escort—although with less dexterity of deportment than before, owing to the fact that this time his thoughts were occupied with more essential matters of procedure.","“Konstantin! it’s time we got up,” said the mistress, rising from her chair. Platonov rose , Kostanzhoglo rose, Chichikov rose, though he wanted to go on sitting and listening. Offering her the crook of his arm, he led the mistress back. But his head was not affably inclined to one side, his maneuvering lacked adroitness, because his thoughts were occupied with essential maneuvers and considerations.",
"Нельзя, однако же, сказать, чтобы природа героя нашего была так сурова и черства и чувства его были да того притуплены, чтобы он не знал ни жалости, ни сострадания; он чувствовал и то и другое, он бы даже хотел помочь, но только, чтобы не заключалось это в значительной сумме, чтобы не трогать уже тех денег, которых положено было не трогать; словом, отцовское наставление: береги и копи копейку — пошло впрок. Но в нем не было привязанности собственно к деньгам для денег; им не владели скряжничество и скупость. Нет, не они двигали им: ему мерещилась впереди жизнь во всех довольствах, со всякими достатками; экипажи, дом, отлично устроенный, вкусные обеды — вот что беспрерывно носилось в голове его. Чтобы наконец потом, со временем, вкусить непременно все это, вот для чего береглась копейка, скупо отказываемая до времени и себе и другому. Когда проносился мимо его богач на пролетных красивых дрожках, на рысаках в богатой упряжи, он как вкопанный останавливался на месте и потом, очнувшись, как после долгого сна, говорил: «А ведь был конторщик, волосы носил в кружок!» И все, что ни отзывалось богатством и довольством, производило на него впечатление, непостижимое им самим. Вышед из училища, он не хотел даже отдохнуть: так сильно было у него желанье скорее приняться за дело и службу. Однако же, несмотря на похвальные аттестаты, с большим трудом определился он в казенную палату. И в дальних захолустьях нужна протекция! Местечко досталось ему ничтожное, жалованья тридцать или сорок рублей в год. Но решился он жарко заняться службою, все победить и преодолеть. И точно, самоотвержение, терпенье и ограничение нужд показал он неслыханное. С раннего утра до позднего вечера, не уставая ни душевными, ни телесными силами, писал он, погрязнув весь в канцелярские бумаги, не ходил домой, спал в канцелярских комнатах на столах, обедал подчас с сторожами и при всем том умел сохранить опрятность, порядочно одеться, сообщить лицу приятное выражение и даже что-то благородное в движениях. Надобно сказать, что палатские чиновники особенно отличались невзрачностью и неблагообразием. У иных были лица, точно дурно выпеченный хлеб: щеку раздуло в одну сторону, подбородок покосило в другую, верхнюю губу вынесло пузырем, которая в прибавку к тому еще и треснула; словом, совсем некрасиво. Говорили они все как-то сурово, таким голосом, как бы собирались кого прибить; приносили частые жертвы Вакху, показав таким образом, чти в славянской природе есть еще много остатков язычества; приходили даже подчас в присутствие, как говорится, нализавшись, отчего в присутствии было нехорошо и воздух был вовсе не ароматический. Между такими чиновниками не мог не быть замечен и отличен Чичиков, представляя во всем совершенную противоположность и взрачностью лица, и приветливостью голоса, и совершенным неупотребленьем никаких крепких напитков. Но при всем том трудна была его дорога; он попал под начальство уже престарелому повытчику, который был образ какой-то каменной бесчувственности и непотрясаемости: вечно тот же, неприступный, никогда в жизни не явивший на лице своем усмешки, не приветствовавший ни разу никого даже запросом о здоровье. Никто не видал, чтобы он хоть раз был не тем, чем всегда, хоть на улице, хоть у себя дома; хоть бы раз показал он в чем-нибудь участье, хоть бы напился пьян и в пьянстве рассмеялся бы; хоть бы даже предался дикому веселью, какому предается разбойник в пьяную минуту, но даже тени не было в нем ничего такого. Ничего не было в нем ровно: ни злодейского, ни доброго, и что-то страшное являлось в сем отсутствии всего. Черство-мраморное лицо его, без всякой резкой неправильности, не намекало ни на какое сходство; в суровой соразмерности между собою были черты его. Одни только частые рябины и ухабины, истыкавшие их, причисляли его к числу тех лиц, на которых, по народному выражению, черт приходил по ночам молотить горох. Казалось, не было сил человеческих подбиться к такому человеку и привлечь его расположение, но Чичиков попробовал. Сначала он принялся угождать во всяких незаметных мелочах: рассмотрел внимательно чинку перьев, какими писал он, и, приготовивши несколько по образцу их, клал ему всякий раз их под руку; сдувал и сметал со стола его песок и табак; завел новую тряпку для его чернильницы; отыскал где-то его шапку, прескверную шапку, какая когда-либо существовала в мире, и всякий раз клал ее возле него за минуту до окончания присутствия; чистил ему спину, если тот запачкал ее мелом у стены, — но все это осталось решительно без всякого замечания, так, как будто ничего этого не было и делано. Наконец он пронюхал его домашнюю, семейственную жизнь, узнал, что у него была зрелая дочь, с лицом, тоже похожим на то, как будто бы на нем происходила по ночам молотьба гороху. С этой-то стороны придумал он навести приступ. Узнал, в какую церковь приходила она по воскресным дням, становился всякий раз насупротив ее, чисто одетый, накрахмаливши сильно манишку, — и дело возымело успех: пошатнулся суровый повытчик и зазвал его на чай! И в канцелярии не успели оглянуться, как устроилось дело так, что Чичиков переехал к нему в дом, сделался нужным и необходимым человеком, закупал и муку и сахар, с дочерью обращался, как с невестой, повытчика звал папенькой, целовал его в руку; все положили в палате, что в конце февраля перед великим постом будет свадьба. Суровый повытчик стал даже хлопотать за него у начальства, и чрез несколько времени Чичиков сам сел повытчиком на одно открывшееся вакантное место. В этом, казалось, и заключалась главная цель связей его с старым повытчиком, потому что тут же сундук свой он отправил секретно домой и на другой день очутился уже на другой квартире. Повытчика перестал звать папенькой и не целовал больше его руки, а о свадьбе так дело и замялось, как будто вовсе ничего не происходило. Однако же, встречаясь с ним, он всякий раз ласково жал ему руку и приглашал его на чай, так что старый повытчик, несмотря на вечную неподвижность и черствое равнодушие, всякий раз встряхивал головою и произносил себе под нос: «Надул, надул, чертов сын!»","It cannot, however, be said that the nature of our hero was so severe and callous, and that his feelings were so dulled that he knew neither pity nor compassion; he felt both, he would even want to help, but only so that it does not consist in a significant amount, so as not to touch the money that was supposed to be left alone; in a word, the father's admonition: take care and save a penny - it went for the future. But in him there was no attachment to money proper for money's sake; he was not possessed by stinginess and stinginess. No, they did not move him: he imagined ahead of him life in all contentment, with all sorts of prosperity; carriages, a house perfectly arranged, delicious dinners - that was what constantly rushed through his head. So that finally later, in time, to taste all this without fail, that's why the penny was spared, sparingly refusing for the time being both to oneself and to another. When a rich man rushed past him on a beautiful flying droshky, on trotters in a rich harness, he would stop in his tracks and then, waking up, as if after a long sleep, he would say: “But there was a clerk, he wore his hair in a circle!” And everything that did not respond with wealth and contentment made an impression on him, incomprehensible to himself. Having left the school, he did not even want to rest: he had such a strong desire to get down to work and service as soon as possible. However, despite the commendable certificates, with great difficulty he decided to go to the Treasury. And in the distant backwoods, protection is needed! He got an insignificant place, a salary of thirty or forty rubles a year. But he decided to take up the service passionately, to conquer and overcome everything. And indeed, self-sacrifice, patience and limitation of needs, he showed unheard of. From early morning until late at night, not tired of either mental or bodily strength, he wrote, mired all in stationery, did not go home, slept in the office rooms on the tables, sometimes dined with the watchmen, and for all that he knew how to keep neatness, to dress decently. , tell the face a pleasant expression and even something noble in the movements. It must be said that the chamber officials were especially distinguished by their homeliness and ugliness. Others had faces like badly baked bread: their cheeks were swollen in one direction, their chins slanted in the other, their upper lip was bulged out, which, in addition to that, also cracked; in other words, it's not pretty at all. They all spoke somehow sternly, in such a voice, as if they were going to beat someone; they made frequent sacrifices to Bacchus, thus showing that in Slavic nature there are still many remnants of paganism; sometimes they even came into the presence, as they say, drunk, which is why it was not good in the presence and the air was not at all aromatic. Among such officials, Chichikov could not help but be noticed and distinguished, representing in everything the perfect opposite both in the presence of a face, and the friendliness of his voice, and the complete non-use of any strong drinks. But for all that, his path was difficult; he fell under the command of an already aged priest, who was an image of some kind of stony insensitivity and unshakability: always the same, impregnable, never in his life showing a smile on his face, never once greeting anyone even with a request for health. No one saw that he was at least once not what he always was, even on the street, even at home; if only once he showed his participation in something, if only he got drunk drunk and laughed in drunkenness; even if he indulged in wild merriment, such as a robber indulges in a drunken moment, but there was not even a shadow in him. There was nothing exactly in him: neither villainous nor good, and something terrible appeared in this absence of everything. His callous-marble face, without any sharp irregularity, did not hint at any resemblance; in severe proportion among themselves were his features. Only the frequent mountain ash and potholes that gouged them ranked him among those faces on whom, according to popular expression, the devil came at night to thresh peas. It seemed that there was no human strength to get close to such a person and attract his favor, but Chichikov tried. At first he began to please in all sorts of inconspicuous trifles: he carefully examined the feathers with which he wrote, and having prepared several according to their model, put them under his arm each time; he blew and swept sand and tobacco from his table; got a new rag for his inkwell; I found somewhere his hat, the worst hat that ever existed in the world, and every time I put it near him a minute before the end of the presence; I cleaned his back if he stained it with chalk against the wall, but all this remained absolutely without any remark, as if nothing of this had ever been done. Finally, he sniffed out his home, family life, found out that he had a mature daughter, with a face that also looked like it was threshing peas at night. From this side he thought of inducing an attack. He found out which church she came to on Sundays, stood opposite her every time, cleanly dressed, heavily starched on his shirt-front - and the business was a success: the stern priest staggered and invited him for tea! And in the office they didn’t have time to look back, how things turned out so that Chichikov moved into his house, became a necessary and necessary person, bought both flour and sugar, treated his daughter like a bride, called the clerk papa, kissed him on the hand; everyone put in the ward that at the end of February there would be a wedding before Lent. The stern assistant even began to fuss with the authorities for him, and after a while Chichikov himself sat down as an assistant to one vacant position that had opened up. This, it seemed, was the main purpose of his ties with the old associate, because he immediately sent his chest secretly home and the next day found himself in another apartment. Povytchik ceased to be called papa and no longer kissed his hand, and the matter of the wedding was so hushed up, as if nothing had happened at all. However, every time he met him, he affectionately shook his hand and invited him to tea, so that the old clerk, despite his eternal immobility and callous indifference, shook his head every time and said under his breath: !""","It cannot be said, however, that our hero was naturally hard and callous, or that his feelings were so blunted that he knew neither pity nor compassion. He was capable of feeling both; he would even have liked to help so long as no considerable sum was involved, so long as he had not to touch the money which he had determined not to touch; in short his father’s admonition, “Be careful and save money,” was bearing fruit, but he had no great love of money for its own sake: he was not governed by meanness and miserliness. No, those were not the motives that actuated him; he had a vision of a future of ease and comfort with enough of everything; carriages, a well-built house, good dinners— these were the ideals continually floating in his mind. It was to make sure of enjoying all this some day in the future, that the kopecks were saved, and for a time stingily denied himself and to others. When a rich man dashed by him in a light elegant droshky drawn by richly-harnessed trotting horses, he would stand still as though rooted to the spot, and then as though waking from a long sleep, would say: “Why, he was a counting-house clerk and wore his hair cut like a peasant‘s!” And everything suggestive of wealth and prosperity made an impression upon him that he could not himself explain. On leaving school he did not even want to take a holiday, so strong was his desire to set to work at once and get into the service. In spite, however, of his high testimonials, it was with great difficulty that he succeeded in getting a berth in the Palace of Justice; even in the remotest corners powerful patronage is just as necessary! The job he obtained was a wretched one, the salary a miserable thirty or forty roubles a year. But he resolved to set to work zealously, to conquer and overcome all difficulties. And, indeed, he displayed incredible self-sacrifice, patience and self-denial. From early morning till late in the evening, without flagging spiritually or physically, he was up to the ears in official papers. He did not go home, but slept at the office on the tables, had dinner sometimes with the porters, and with all that, succeeded in preserving his neat exterior, in dressing decently, in retaining an agreeable expression on his face, and even something of dignity in his movements. It must be said that the officials of the Palace of Justice were distinguished by their ugliness and unprepossessing appearance. Some had faces that looked like badly-baked bread, with a cheek swollen out on one side, and the chin bent in the other direction, with a pimple on the upper lip, which was cracked, moreover—in fact they were anything but pretty. They all spoke gruffly in a voice that sounded as if they were just going to hit some one; they frequently sacrificed to Bacchus,dt so proving that there are many relics of paganism left in the Slovanic nature; they used even to come to the office sometimes the worse for liquor, as it is called, which made things very unpleasant and the air anything but fragrant. Tchitchikov, who was a complete contrast to them both in his looks, in the affableness of his voice and in his complete abstinence from strong drink, could not but be conspicuous and distinguished among such clerks. But, for all that, his progress was difficult. He was under the authority of a very old head clerk, who was the very incarnation of stony callousness and insensibility: everlastingly the same, unapproachable, he had never in his life displayed a trace of a smile on his face, he had never greeted any one even with an inquiry after his health. No one had ever seen him different from what he always was, either in the street, or at home. If only he had shown an interest in anything; if only he had got drunk and laughed in his cups; or if he had given himself up to the savage merriment of a drunken robber, but there was not a shadow of anything of the sort. There was absolutely nothing in him; neither wickedness nor goodness, and there was something terrible about this absence of anything. His coarsely marble-like face, free from any striking irregularity, did not suggest resemblance to anything; there was a morose harmony between his features. Only the pockmarks with which his face was pitted classified it with those faces on which, to use the popular expression, the devil has threshed peas at night. It seemed as though it were beyond human power to make up to this man and win his favour, but Tchitchikov made the attempt. At first he set to work to please him in all sorts of imperceptible trifles; he carefully considered the way he mended the pens with which he wrote, and preparing several on the same pattern, always put them ready to his hand; he blew or brushed away the sand and tobacco from his table, and brought a new rag to clean his inkstand; he looked for and found his hat, as wretched a hat as ever was seen in the world, and always laid it beside him before closing time; he brushed the back of the old man’s coat if he chanced to rub against the whitewashed wall. But it remained absolutely unnoticed, exactly as though nothing had been done. At last he sniffed out something about his private life: he found out that he had a rather mature daughter whose face also looked as if the devil had threshed peas on it. He determined to make his attack on that side. He found out what church she went to on Sundays, and made a practice of standing just opposite her, neatly dressed, with a stiffly starched shirt-front. This strategy was crowned with success: the morose head clerk was shaken and invited him to tea! And before the clerks in the office had time to look round things had gone so far that Tchitchikov had moved into the old man’s house, had become useful and indispensable to him, bought the flour and the sugar for the household, behaved to the daughter as though they were engaged, called the head clerk papa and kissed his hand. Every one in the office assumed that at the end of February, before Lent, there would be a wedding. The morose old head clerk even began trying to promote his interests with the higher powers, and in a short time Tchitchikov was himself appointed to a post as head clerk, which had just fallen vacant. This, it seemed, was the chief object of his connection with the old clerk, for the next day Tchitchikov secretly removed his trunk, and the following morning departed to another lodging. He left off calling the old head clerk papa, and never kissed his hand again, and the question of marriage dropped, as though it had never been thought of. Whenever he met the old man, however, he shook hands with him affably and invited him to tea, so that, in spite of the old clerk’s invariable stoniness and gruff indifference, he always shook his head and muttered to himself: “You took me in, you took me in, you limb of Satan!”","Yet let it not be inferred from this that our hero’s character had grown so blase and hard, or his conscience so blunted, as to preclude his experiencing a particle of sympathy or compassion. As a matter of fact, he was capable both of the one and the other, and would have been glad to assist his old teacher had no great sum been required, or had he not been called upon to touch the fund which he had decided should remain intact. In other words, the father’s injunction, “Guard and save every kopeck,” had become a hard and fast rule of the son’s. Yet the youth had no particular attachment to money for money’s sake; he was not possessed with the true instinct for hoarding and niggardliness. Rather, before his eyes there floated ever a vision of life and its amenities and advantages—a vision of carriages and an elegantly furnished house and recherche dinners; and it was in the hope that some day he might attain these things that he saved every kopeck and, meanwhile, stinted both himself and others. Whenever a rich man passed him by in a splendid drozhki drawn by swift and handsomely-caparisoned horses, he would halt as though deep in thought, and say to himself, like a man awakening from a long sleep: “That gentleman must have been a financier, he has so little hair on his brow.” In short, everything connected with wealth and plenty produced upon him an ineffaceable impression. Even when he left school he took no holiday, so strong in him was the desire to get to work and enter the Civil Service. Yet, for all the encomiums contained in his diploma, he had much ado to procure a nomination to a Government Department; and only after a long time was a minor post found for him, at a salary of thirty or forty roubles a year. Nevertheless, wretched though this appointment was, he determined, by strict attention to business, to overcome all obstacles, and to win success. And, indeed, the self-denial, the patience, and the economy which he displayed were remarkable. From early morn until late at night he would, with indefatigable zeal of body and mind, remain immersed in his sordid task of copying official documents—never going home, snatching what sleep he could on tables in the building, and dining with the watchman on duty. Yet all the while he contrived to remain clean and neat, to preserve a cheerful expression of countenance, and even to cultivate a certain elegance of movement. In passing, it may be remarked that his fellow tchinovniks were a peculiarly plain, unsightly lot, some of them having faces like badly baked bread, swollen cheeks, receding chins, and cracked and blistered upper lips. Indeed, not a man of them was handsome. Also, their tone of voice always contained a note of sullenness, as though they had a mind to knock some one on the head; and by their frequent sacrifices to Bacchus they showed that even yet there remains in the Slavonic nature a certain element of paganism. Nay, the Director’s room itself they would invade while still licking their lips, and since their breath was not over-aromatic, the atmosphere of the room grew not over-pleasant. Naturally, among such an official staff a man like Chichikov could not fail to attract attention and remark, since in everything—in cheerfulness of demeanour, in suavity of voice, and in complete neglect of the use of strong potions—he was the absolute antithesis of his companions. Yet his path was not an easy one to tread, for over him he had the misfortune to have placed in authority a Chief Clerk who was a graven image of elderly insensibility and inertia. Always the same, always unapproachable, this functionary could never in his life have smiled or asked civilly after an acquaintance’s health. Nor had any one ever seen him a whit different in the street or at his own home from what he was in the office, or showing the least interest in anything whatever, or getting drunk and relapsing into jollity in his cups, or indulging in that species of wild gaiety which, when intoxicated, even a burglar affects. No, not a particle of this was there in him. Nor, for that matter, was there in him a particle of anything at all, whether good or bad: which complete negativeness of character produced rather a strange effect. In the same way, his wizened, marble-like features reminded one of nothing in particular, so primly proportioned were they. Only the numerous pockmarks and dimples with which they were pitted placed him among the number of those over whose faces, to quote the popular saying, “ The Devil has walked by night to grind peas.” In short, it would seem that no human agency could have approached such a man and gained his goodwill. Yet Chichikov made the effort. As a first step, he took to consulting the other’s convenience in all manner of insignificant trifles—to cleaning his pens carefully, and, when they had been prepared exactly to the Chief Clerk’s liking, laying them ready at his elbow; to dusting and sweeping from his table all superfluous sand and tobacco ash; to procuring a new mat for his inkstand; to looking for his hat—the meanest-looking hat that ever the world beheld—and having it ready for him at the exact moment when business came to an end; to brushing his back if it happened to become smeared with whitewash from a wall. Yet all this passed as unnoticed as though it had never been done. Finally, Chichikov sniffed into his superior’s family and domestic life, and learnt that he possessed a grown-up daughter on whose face also there had taken place a nocturnal, diabolical grinding of peas. HERE was a quarter whence a fresh attack might be delivered! After ascertaining what church the daughter attended on Sundays, our hero took to contriving to meet her in a neat suit and a well-starched dickey: and soon the scheme began to work. The surly Chief Clerk wavered for a while; then ended by inviting Chichikov to tea. Nor could any man in the office have told you how it came about that before long Chichikov had removed to the Chief Clerk’s house, and become a person necessary—indeed indispensable—to the household, seeing that he bought the flour and the sugar, treated the daughter as his betrothed, called the Chief Clerk “Papenka,” and occasionally kissed “Papenka’s” hand. In fact, every one at the office supposed that, at the end of February (i.e. before the beginning of Lent) there would take place a wedding. Nay, the surly father even began to agitate with the authorities on Chichikov’s behalf, and so enabled our hero, on a vacancy occurring, to attain the stool of a Chief Clerk. Apparently this marked the consummation of Chichikov’s relations with his host, for he hastened stealthily to pack his trunk and, the next day, figured in a fresh lodging. Also, he ceased to call the Chief Clerk “Papenka,” or to kiss his hand; and the matter of the wedding came to as abrupt a termination as though it had never been mooted. Yet also he never failed to press his late host’s hand, whenever he met him, and to invite him to tea; while, on the other hand, for all his immobility and dry indifference, the Chief Clerk never failed to shake his head with a muttered, “Ah, my fine fellow, you have grown too proud, you have grown too proud.”","It is impossible, however, to say that our hero’s nature was so hard and callous and his feelings were so dulled that he did not know either pity or compassion; he felt both the one and the other, he would even want to help, but only provided it was not a significant sum, provided the money he had resolved not to touch remained untouched; in short, the fatherly admonition—“Keep and save your kopeck”—proved beneficial. But he was not attached to money for its own sake; he was not possessed by stinginess and miserliness. No, they were not what moved him: he pictured ahead of him a life of every comfort, of every sort of prosperity; carriages, an excellently furnished house, tasty dinners— this was what constantly hovered in his head. So as to be sure ultimately, in time, to taste all that—this was the reason for saving kopecks, stingily denied in the meantime both to himself and to others. When a rich man raced by him in a pretty, light droshky, his trotters richly harnessed, he would stand rooted to the spot, and then, coming to, as if after a long sleep, would say: “Yet he used to be a clerk and had a bowl haircut!” And whatever there was that smacked of wealth and prosperity produced an impression on him inconceivable to himself. On leaving school he did not even want to rest: so strong was his desire to get quickly down to business and start in the service. However, despite his honors diploma, it was with great difficulty that he found himself a place in the treasury. Even in a remote backwoods one needs patronage! The little post he got was a wretched one, the salary thirty or forty roubles a year. But he resolved to engage himself ardently in his service, to conquer and overcome all. And indeed he displayed unheard-of self-denial, patience, and restriction of needs. From early morning till late evening, tireless of both body and soul, he kept writing, all buried in office papers, did not go home, slept on tables in office rooms, ate on occasion with the caretakers, and for all that managed to keep himself tidy, to dress decently, to give his face an agreeable expression, and even a certain nobility to his gestures. It must be said that the treasury clerks were particularly distinguished by their unsightliness and unattractiveness. Some had faces like badly baked bread: a cheek bulging out on one side, the chin skewed to the other, the upper lip puffed into a blister, and cracked besides—in short, quite ugly. They all talked somehow harshly, in such tones as if they were about to give someone a beating; sacrifices were frequently offered to Bacchus, thereby showing that many leftovers of paganism still persist in the Slavic nature; occasionally they even came to the office soused, as they say, for which reason the office was not a very nice place and the air was far from aromatic. Among such clerks Chichikov could not fail to be noticed and distinguished, presenting a complete contrast to them in all ways, by the attractiveness of his face, and the amiableness of his voice, and his total abstention from all strong drink. Yet, for all that, his path was difficult; his superior was an elderly department chief, who was the image of some stony insensibility and unshakableness: eternally the same, unapproachable, never in his life showing a smile on his face, never once greeting anyone even with an inquiry after their health. No one had ever seen him, even once, be other than he always was, either in the street or at home; if only he had once shown sympathy for something or other, if only he had gotten drunk and in his drunkenness burst out laughing; if only he had even given himself to wild gaiety, as a robber will in a drunken moment—but there was not even a shadow of anything of the sort in him. There was precisely nothing in him, neither villainy nor goodness, and something frightful showed itself in this absence of everything. His callously marble face, with no sharp irregularity, did not hint at any resemblance; his features were in strict proportion to each other. Only the quantity of pocks and pits that mottled it included it in the number of those faces on which, according to the popular expression, the devil comes at night to thresh peas. It seemed beyond human power to suck up to such a man and win his favor, but Chichikov tried. To begin with, he set about pleasing him in various inconspicuous trifles: he made a close study of how the pens he wrote with were sharpened, and, preparing a few in that way, placed them at his hand each day; he blew and brushed the sand and tobacco from his desk; he provided a new rag for his inkstand; he found his hat somewhere, the vilest hat that ever existed in the world, and placed it by him each day a minute before the end of office hours; he cleaned off his back when he got whitewash on it from the wall—but all this went decidedly unnoticed, the same as if none of it had been done. Finally he sniffed out his home and family life, and learned that he had a grown-up daughter whose face also looked as if the threshing of peas took place on it nightly. It was from this side that he decided to mount his assault. Learning what church she went to on Sundays, he would stand opposite her each time, in clean clothes, his shirtfront stiffly starched—and the thing proved a success: the stern department chief wavered and invited him to tea! And before anyone in the office had time to blink, things got so arranged that Chichikov moved into his house, became a necessary and indispensable man, purchased the flour and the sugar, treated the daughter as his fiancée, called the department chief papa, and kissed his hand; everyone in the office decided that at the end of February, before the Great Lent, there would be a wedding.57 The stern department chief even began soliciting the authorities, and in a short time Chichikov himself was installed as a department chief in a vacancy that had come open. In this, it seemed, the main purpose of his connection with the old department chief consisted, because he straightaway sent his trunk home in secret, and the next day was already settled in other quarters. He stopped calling the department chief papa and no longer kissed his hand, and the matter of the wedding was hushed up, as if nothing had ever happened. However, on meeting him, he amiably shook his hand each time and invited him to tea, so that the old department chief, despite his eternal immobility and callous indifference, shook his head each time and muttered under his breath: “Hoodwinked, hoodwinked—that devil’s son!”","It cannot be said, however, that the nature of our hero was really so harsh and callous and that his feelings were so dulled that he knew neither pity nor compassion. He felt both the one and the other; he was even willing to help, but only if that help did not call for a great sum, only if it did not involve his having to touch that money which he had definitely proposed to leave untouched. In short, his father’s admonition, “Take care of each copper and save it,” had had its beneficial effect. But essentially he did not have any attachment for money qua money; meanness and miserliness had not taken possession of him. No, it was not these that motivated him; he envisaged ahead of him a life all of ease, with all manner of good things: carriages, an excellently built house, delectable dinners—these were the things that incessantly swarmed through his head. It was in order that he might ultimately and inevitably partake of all this later on, in due course of time, that every copper was saved, was stingily denied for the time being both to himself and to others. When some rich man whirled past him in a light, handsome droshky, drawn by thoroughbreds in rich harness, he’d stop as if he were rooted to the spot and then, upon coming to as if after a long sleep, would say: “ And yet that fellow was nothing but an office clerk and used to wear his hair bobbed like a peasant!” And everything that had an aura of riches and well-being made an impression upon him which he himself could not analyze. Upon getting out of school he did not want to take any time out, so strong was his desire to get down to business and to obtain a post as quickly as possible. However, despite the certificates cum laude he had received, it was only with great difficulty that he got into the Treasury Department—even in the tallest of the sticks one needs patronage! The place that fell to his lot was an insignificant one, the salary some thirty or forty rubles a year. But he resolved to buckle down fervidly to his work, to conquer and overcome everything. And he most certainly evinced unheard-of self-sacrifice, patience, and self-denial even in necessities. From early morn till late at night, with neither his spiritual nor his bodily forces flagging, he wrote on and on, plunged up to his ears in the chancellery papers; he did not go home but slept in the chancellery chambers upon the desks, dining at times with the chancellery watchmen, yet with all that was able to preserve his neatness, to dress decently, to impart a pleasing expression to his face and even a something that was genteel to his every movement. It must be said that the clerks in the Treasury were especially distinguished for their unprepossessing and unsightly appearance. Some had faces for all the world like badly baked bread: one cheek would be all puffed out to one side, the chin slanting off to the other, the upper lip blown up into a big blister that, to top it all off, had burst; in short, it wasn’t at all a pretty face to look at. They spoke, all of them, somehow dourly, in such a voice as if they were getting all set to slap somebody down; they offered frequent libations to Bacchus, thus demonstrating that there were still many vestiges of paganism in the Slavic nature; on occasion they even came to the office full to the gills, as they say, because of which the office was not any too fine a place and the air was not at all aromatic. Among such clerks Chichikov could not but be noticed and marked out, offering as he did a perfect contrast not only by the prepossessing appearance of his face but, as well, by the cordiality in his voice and his total abstinence from the use of strong spirits. Yet with all that his path was a hard and thorny one. It fell to his lot to have as his immediate superior a Registrar who had already grown old in the service, who was the personification of indescribably stony insensibility and imperturbability, everlastingly the same, unapproachable; a man who had never in his life shown a smile on his face, who had not even once greeted anybody with so much as an inquiry about his health. Nobody had ever seen him, even once, being anything else but what he always was—not even in the street, not even at home. If he had even once evinced any concern for anything, if he had even once got drunk and in his drunkenness broken into laughter, if he had even once given himself up to wild merrymaking, such as a brigand gives himself up to in a moment of drunkenness! But there was not as much as a shadow of anything even as human as that about him. There was just nothing at all in him, either of wickedness or of goodness, and there was a manifestation of something fearful in this absence of everything. His face, as hard as marble, without any sharp irregularity, did not hint at any resemblance to any other face; his features were in severe proportionality to one another. Only the numerous pockmarks and bumps thickly strewn over them made his face one of the number of those upon which, as the folk expression has it, the Devil comes at night to thresh peas. It looked as if it were beyond any human powers to get at this man and win his good graces, but Chichikov made the attempt. As a beginning he started catering to him in all sorts of imperceptible trifles: he examined closely the way he cut his quills and, having prepared several modeled after his, put them close to the Registrar ’s hand every time he needed a quill; he blew and brushed grains of blotting-sand and snuff off the Registrar’s desk; he dug up a new rag to clean the Registrar’s inkpot with; he would find the Registrar’s cap for him, wherever he may have put it (and a most abominable cap it was too—just about the most abominable the world had ever seen) and would always lay it near the Registrar just a minute before the office closed; he brushed off the Registrar’s back if the latter happened to soil it with whitewash off the wall. But all this remained absolutely without any notice, just as though nothing whatsoever had been done. Finally he got wind of the Registrar’s family life; he learned that the Registrar had a mature daughter, with a face that also looked as if peas were threshed on it at night. It occurred to him to attack the fortress from this side. He found out what church she attended on Sundays and each time took his stand across the aisle from her, neatly dressed, with his shirt bosom stiffly starched. And the ruse met with success: the dour Registrar was swayed and invited him to tea! And before the clerks in the chancellery had a chance to look around, matters were so arranged that Chichikov moved into the Registrar’s house, became a useful and indispensable person there, doing the buying of the flour and sugar for the household, treating the daughter as a fiancee, calling the Registrar his dear papa and kissing his hand. Everybody in the Treasury assumed that by the end of February, before Lent, the wedding would take place. The dour Registrar even began working on the higher-ups for a better place for Chichikov, and after a while Chichikov was himself filling a Registrar’s post that had just become vacant. This, apparently, was precisely what the chief purpose of his ties with the old Registrar had been, because right then and there he secretly sent his trunk back home and the next day was already settled in another lodging. He stopped calling the old Registrar dear papa and no longer kissed his hand; and as for the wedding, matters there somehow got lost in the shuffle, as though nothing at all had ever happened. Just the same, whenever he encountered the old Registrar, he would cordially shake his hand and invite him to tea, so that the old man, despite his eternal stoni ness and hard indifference, would shake his head every time and mutter under his breath: “He took me in, he took me in, the limb of Satan that he is!”"

"Пока продолжались разговоры, начали мало-помалу появляться свидетели: знакомый читателю прокурор-моргун, инспектор врачебной управы, Трухачевский, Бегушкин и прочие, по словам Собакевича, даром бременящие землю.

Каждый из свидетелей поместил себя со всеми своими достоинствами и чинами, кто оборотным шрифтом, кто косяками, кто просто чуть не вверх ногами, помещая такие буквы, каких даже и не видано было в русском алфавите. Известный Иван Антонович управился весьма проворно: крепости были записаны, помечены, занесены в книгу и куда следует, с принятием полупроцентовых и за припечатку в «Ведомостях», и Чичикову пришлось заплатить самую малость. Даже председатель дал приказание из пошлинных денег взять с него только половину, а другая, неизвестно каким образом, отнесена была на счет какого-то другого просителя.","While the conversations continued, little by little witnesses began to appear: the public prosecutor familiar to the reader, the inspector of the medical board, Trukhachevsky, Begushkin and others, according to Sobakevich, burdening the earth for nothing. Many of them were completely unfamiliar to Chichikov: those who were missing and superfluous were recruited right there, from the chamber officials. They also brought not only the son of Archpriest Father Cyril, but even the Archpriest himself. Each of the witnesses placed himself with all his merits and ranks, some in reverse type, some in jambs, some just almost upside down, placing letters that were not even seen in the Russian alphabet. The famous Ivan Antonovich managed very quickly: the fortresses were written down, marked, entered in the book and where they should be, with the acceptance of half a percent and for a print in Vedomosti, and Chichikov had to pay a very small amount. Even the chairman gave an order to take only half of the duty money from him, and the other, it is not known how, was attributed to the account of some other petitioner.","While the conversation continued, the witnesses began to turn up, one by one, the winking prosecutor, already known to the reader, the inspector of the medical board, Truhatchevsky, Byegushkin and the others whom Sobakevitch had described as cumberers of the earth. With some of them Tchitchikov was quite unacquainted. The number was made up by taking some clerks from the office. Not only the son of Father Kirill but Father Kirill himself was brought. Each of the witnesses put down his name with all his grades and qualifications, some in an upright hand, others in a slanting handwriting, others forming letters almost upside down, such as had never been seen in the Russian alphabet. Ivan Antonovitch, known already to the reader, got through the business very rapidly, the purchase deeds were drawn up, revised, entered in a book and wherever else was necessary, and the half per cent, and charge for publication in the Gazetteer were made out, and Tchitchikov had to pay the merest trifle. The president even gave orders that only half the usual dues should be charged to him, and the other half was in some mysterious way transferred to the account of some other applicant.","Whilst the foregoing conversation had been in progress, various witnesses had been arriving on the scene. They consisted of the constantly blinking Public Prosecutor, the Inspector of the Medical Department, and others—all, to quote Sobakevitch, “men who cumbered the ground for nothing.” With some of them, however, Chichikov was altogether unacquainted, since certain substitutes and supernumeraries had to be pressed into the service from among the ranks of the subordinate staff. There also arrived, in answer to the summons, not only the son of Father Cyril before mentioned, but also Father Cyril himself. Each such witness appended to his signature a full list of his dignities and qualifications: one man in printed characters, another in a flowing hand, a third in topsy-turvy characters of a kind never before seen in the Russian alphabet, and so forth. Meanwhile our friend Ivan Antonovitch comported himself with not a little address; and after the indentures had been signed, docketed, and registered, Chichikov found himself called upon to pay only the merest trifle in the way of Government percentage and fees for publishing the transaction in the Official Gazette. The reason of this was that the President had given orders that only half the usual charges were to be exacted from the present purchaser—the remaining half being somehow debited to the account of another applicant for serf registration.","While the conversation continued, the witnesses gradually began to appear: the blinking prosecutor, already known to the reader, the inspector of the board of health, Trukhachevsky, Begushkin, and others who, in Sobakevich’s words, were a useless burden on the earth. Many of them were completely unknown to Chichikov: the lacking and the extras were recruited on the spot from among the office clerks. Not only was the archpriest Father Kiril’s son brought, but even the archpriest himself. Each of the witnesses put himself down, with all his dignities and ranks, one in backhand script, one slanting forward, one simply all but upside down, putting himself in such letters as had never even been seen before in the Russian alphabet. The familiar Ivan Antonovich managed quite deftly: the deeds were recorded, marked, entered in the register and wherever else necessary, with a charge of half a percent plus the notice in the Gazette, and so Chichikov had to pay the smallest sum. The magistrate even ordered that he be charged only half the tax money, while the other half, in some unknown fashion, was transferred to the account of some other petitioner.","While these conversations were going on, the witnesses began to appear, little by little: The blinking Public Prosecutor with whom the reader is already acquainted, the Inspector of the Board of Health, Trukhachevski, Begushkin, and the others who, according to Sobakevich, were all useless and merely cumbered the earth. Many of them were utter strangers to Chichikov; to make up the necessary number of witnesses, some of the clerks were recruited on the spot. They also brought not only the son of Father Kiril the Archpriest but even the Archpriest himself. Each one of the witnesses affixed his signature, with all his attributes and ranks, some in a backhanded scrawl, some in slanting pothooks, some almost upside down, putting down such characters as were not even to be found in the Russian alphabet. Ivan Antonovich, whom we already know, had managed his end quite deftly and quickly; the purchase deeds were recorded, marked, entered in the proper ledger and wherever else was necessary, the tax of one-half of one percent and the charge for the notices in the Moscow News had already been manipulated, and Chichikov somehow had to pay but a mere trifle. The Chairman even issued an order that only half the revenue tax be taken from him, while the other half, in some unknown manner, was transferred to the account of some other applicant."

"— Да как вам сказать, Афанасий Васильевич? Я не знаю, лучше ли мои обстоятельства. Мне досталось всего пятьдесят душ крестьян и тридцать тысяч денег, которыми я должен был расплатиться с частью моих долгов, — и у меня вновь ровно ничего. А главное дело, что дело по этому завещанью самое нечистое. Тут, Афанасий Васильевич, завелись такие мошенничества! Я вам сейчас расскажу, и вы подивитесь, что такое делается. Этот Чичиков…","“But how can I tell you, Afanasy Vasilyevich? I don't know if my circumstances are better. I got only fifty souls of peasants and thirty thousand money with which I had to pay off part of my debts - and again I have absolutely nothing.

This Chichikov...","“What shall I say, Afanasy Vassilyevitch? I don’t know whether my position is any better. All that came to me was fifty serfs and thirty thousand roubles, with which I shall have to pay part of my debts, and then I shall have absolutely nothing again.

I’ll tell you all about it and you will be amazed at the things that have been done. That Tchitchikov ...”","“It would be difficult to say whether or not my affairs are improved,” replied Khlobuev. “True, fifty souls and thirty thousand roubles came to me from Madame Khanasarova, but I had to pay them away to satisfy my debts. Consequently I am once more destitute. But the important point is that there was trickery connected with the legacy, and shameful trickery at that. Yes, though it may surprise you, it is a fact that that fellow Chichikov—”","“How shall I tell you, Afanasy Vassilyevich? I don’t know whether my circumstances have improved.

"Где не бывает наслаждений? Живут они и в Петербурге, несмотря на суровую, сумрачную его наружность. Трещит по улицам сердитый тридцатиградусный мороз, визжит отчаянным бесом ведьма-вьюга, нахлобучивая на голову воротники шуб и шинелей, пудря усы людей и морды скотов, но приветливо светит вверху окошко где-нибудь, даже и в четвертом этаже: в уютной комнатке, при скромных стеариновых свечках, под шумок самовара, ведется согревающий и сердце и душу разговор, читается светлая страница вдохновенного русского поэта, какими наградил бог свою Россию, и так возвышенно-пылко трепещет молодое сердце юноши, как не случается нигде в других землях и под полуденным роскошным небом.","Where is there no pleasure? They also live in St. Petersburg, despite its stern, gloomy appearance. An angry thirty-degree frost crackles through the streets, a witch-blizzard screeches like a desperate demon, pulling the collars of fur coats and overcoats over her head, powdering the mustaches of people and the muzzles of cattle, but a window shines affably at the top somewhere, even on the fourth floor: in a cozy room, with modest stearin candles, under the guise of a samovar, a conversation is warming both the heart and soul, the bright page of an inspired Russian poet is read, with which God has awarded his Russia, and the young heart of a young man trembles so sublimely and ardently, as it does not happen anywhere else in other lands and under a luxurious midday sky .","Is there any place where there are no enjoyments? They exist even in Petersburg in spite of its grim forbidding aspect. There is a cruel frost in thirty degrees in the street, a witch’s hurricane howls like a despairing devil, flapping the collars of men’s fur coats against their heads, powdering their moustaches and the noses of beasts: but there is a hospitable gleam from some little window even on the fourth storey; in a cosy room a conversation that warms both heart and soul is carried on to the hiss of the samovar, in the humble light of stearinedz candles; an inspired and uplifting page is read from one of the poets with whom God has enriched His Russia, and the youthful heart throbs with a lofty ardour unknown in other lands and under the voluptuous skies of the south.","But where are compensations to be found? Even in St. Petersburg, despite its grim and murky exterior, they exist. Yes, even though thirty degrees of keen, cracking frost may have bound the streets, and the family of the North Wind be wailing there, and the Snowstorm Witch have heaped high the pavements, and be blinding the eyes, and powdering beards and fur collars and the shaggy manes of horses—even THEN there will be shining hospitably through the swirling snowflakes a fourth-floor window where, in a cosy room, and by the light of modest candles, and to the hiss of the samovar, there will be in progress a discussion which warms the heart and soul, or else a reading aloud of a brilliant page of one of those inspired Russian poets with whom God has dowered us, while the breast of each member of the company is heaving with a rapture unknown under a noontide sky.","Where will one not find pleasures? They also live in Petersburg, despite its stern, somber appearance. A biting twenty below zero outside, a witch-blizzard shrieking like a desperate demon, pulling the collars of fur coats and greatcoats over heads, powdering men’s mustaches and animals’ muzzles, but friendly is the light in a window somewhere high up, perhaps even on the fourth floor; in a cozy room, by the light of modest stearin candles, to the hum of the samovar, a heart- and soul-warming conversation goes on, a bright page from an inspired Russian poet, such as God has bestowed upon His Russia, is being read, and a youth’s young heart flutters so ardently and loftily, as never happens in any other lands, even under splendid southern skies.",

В первый раз, как только увидел вас вместе на бале, ну уж, думаю себе, Чичиков, верно, недаром… Впрочем, напрасно ты сделал такой выбор, я ничего в ней не наложу хорошего.

"Перекрестясь по русскому обычаю, приступил он к исполнению. Под видом избрания места для жительства и под другими предлогами предпринял он заглянуть в те и другие углы нашего государства, и преимущественно в те, которые более других пострадали от несчастных случаев, неурожаев, смертностей и прочего и прочего, — словом, где бы можно удобнее и дешевле накупить потребного народа. Он не обращался наобум ко всякому помещику, но избирал людей более по своему вкусу или таких, с которыми бы можно было с меньшими затруднениями делать подобные сделки, стараясь прежде познакомиться, расположить к себе, чтобы, если можно, более дружбою, а не покупкою приобрести мужиков. Итак, читатели не должны негодовать на автора, если лица, доныне являвшиеся, не пришлись по его вкусу; это вина Чичикова, здесь он полный хозяин, и куда ему вздумается, туда и мы должны тащиться. С нашей стороны, если, точно, падет обвинение за бледность и невзрачность лиц и характеров, скажем только то, что никогда вначале не видно всего широкого теченья и объема дела. Въезд в какой бы ни было город, хоть даже в столицу, всегда как-то бледен; сначала все серо и однообразно: тянутся бесконечные заводы да фабрики, закопченные дымом, а потом уже выглянут углы шестиэтажных домов, магазины, вывески, громадные перспективы улиц, все в колокольнях, колоннах, статуях, башнях, с городским блеском, шумом и громом и всем, что на диво произвела рука и мысль человека. Как произвелись первые покупки, читатель уже видел; как пойдет дело далее, какие будут удачи и неудачи герою, как придется разрешить и преодолеть ему более трудные препятствия, как предстанут колоссальные образы, как двигнутся сокровенные рычаги широкой повести, раздастся далече ее горизонт и вся она примет величавое лирическое течение, то увидит потом. Еще много пути предстоит совершить всему походному экипажу, состоящему из господина средних лет, брички, в которой ездят холостяки, лакея Петрушки, кучера Селифана и тройки коней, уже известных поименно от Заседателя до подлеца чубарого. Итак, вот весь налицо герой наш, каков он есть! Но потребуют, может быть, заключительного определения одною чертою: кто же он относительно качеств нравственных? Что он не герой, исполненный совершенств и добродетелей, это видно. Кто же он? стало быть, подлец? Почему ж подлец, зачем же быть так строгу к другим? Теперь у нас подлецов не бывает, есть люди благонамеренные, приятные, а таких, которые бы на всеобщий позор выставили свою физиогномию под публичную оплеуху, отыщется разве каких-нибудь два, три человека, да и те уже говорят теперь о добродетели. Справедливее всего назвать его: хозяин, приобретатель. Приобретение — вина всего; из-за него произвелись дела, которым свет дает название не очень чистых. Правда, в таком характере есть уже что-то отталкивающее, и тот же читатель, который на жизненной своей дороге будет дружен с таким человеком, будет водить с ним хлеб-соль и проводить приятно время, станет глядеть на него косо, если он очутится героем драмы или поэмы. Но мудр тот, кто не гнушается никаким характером, но, вперя в него испытующий взгляд, изведывает его до первоначальных причин. Быстро все превращается в человеке; не успеешь оглянуться, как уже вырос внутри страшный червь, самовластно обративший к себе все жизненные соки. И не раз не только широкая страсть, но ничтожная страстишка к чему-нибудь мелкому разрасталась в рожденном на лучшие подвиги, заставляла его позабывать великие и святые обязанности и в ничтожных побрякушках видеть великое и святое. Бесчисленны, как морские пески, человеческие страсти, и все не похожи одна на другую, и все они, низкие и прекрасные, вначале покорны человеку и потом уже становятся страшными властелинами его. Блажен избравший себе из всех прекраснейшую страсть; растет и десятерится с каждым часом и минутой безмерное его блаженство, и входит он глубже и глубже в бесконечный рай своей души. Но есть страсти, которых избранье не от человека. Уже родились они с ним в минуту рожденья его в свет, и не дано ему сил отклониться от них. Высшими начертаньями они ведутся, и есть в них что-то вечно зовущее, неумолкающее во всю жизнь. Земное великое поприще суждено совершить им: все равно, в мрачном ли образе, или пронестись светлым явленьем, возрадующим мир, — одинаково вызваны они для неведомого человеком блага. И, может быть, в сем же самом Чичикове страсть, его влекущая, уже не от него, и в холодном его существовании заключено то, что потом повергнет в прах и на колени человека пред мудростью небес. И еще тайна, почему сей образ предстал в ныне являющейся на свет поэме.","Crossing himself according to Russian custom, he began to perform. Under the guise of choosing a place to live and under other pretexts, he undertook to look into those and other corners of our state, and mainly into those that suffered more than others from accidents, crop failures, deaths, and other things, and other things, in a word, wherever possible more conveniently and cheaper to buy the needed people. He did not randomly address every landowner, but chose people more to his liking or those with whom it would be possible to make similar deals with less difficulty, trying first to get to know each other, to win him over, so that, if possible, by friendship, and not by purchase, he could acquire men. So, readers should not be indignant at the author if the faces that have hitherto appeared have not come to his taste; this is Chichikov's fault, he is the complete master here, and wherever he pleases, we must drag ourselves there. For our part, if, for sure, the accusation falls for the pallor and homeliness of faces and characters, we will only say that at the beginning one can never see the whole broad course and volume of the case. The entrance to any city, even to the capital, is always somehow pale; at first everything is gray and monotonous: endless factories and factories, sooty with smoke, stretch out, and then the corners of six-story houses, shops, signboards, huge street prospects, all in bell towers, columns, statues, towers, with urban brilliance, noise and thunder and everything that the hand and thought of man miraculously produced. How the first purchases were made, the reader has already seen; how things go further, what successes and failures the hero will have, how he will have to resolve and overcome more difficult obstacles, how colossal images will appear, how the innermost levers of a broad story will move, its horizon will be heard in the distance and all of it will take on a majestic lyrical current, he will see later. There is still a long way to go for the entire traveling carriage, consisting of a middle-aged gentleman, a britzka in which bachelors ride, Petrushka the footman, Selifan the coachman and a trio of horses, already known by name from the Assessor to the black-haired scoundrel. So, here is our hero, what he is! But they will demand, perhaps, a final definition in one line: who is he in relation to moral qualities? That he is not a hero, full of perfection and virtue, is evident. Who is he? so a scoundrel? Why is a scoundrel, why be so strict with others? Now there are no scoundrels among us, there are people who are well-intentioned, pleasant, and those who would put their physiognomy under a public slap in the face to general disgrace, only two or three people can be found, and even they are now talking about virtue. It is most fair to call him: the owner, the acquirer. Acquisition is the fault of everything; because of him things were done, to which the light gives the name of not very pure. True, there is already something repulsive in such a character, and the same reader who, on his life path, will be friends with such a person, will take bread and salt with him and spend pleasant time, will look askance at him if he turns out to be a hero. dramas or poems. But wise is he who does not shun any character, but, fixing him with a searching look, examines him to the original causes. Everything quickly turns into a person; before you have time to look back, a terrible worm has already grown inside, autocratically turning all the vital juices to itself. And more than once, not only a broad passion, but an insignificant passion for something petty grew in one born for the best deeds, made him forget great and holy duties and see the great and holy in insignificant trinkets. Countless, like the sands of the sea, are human passions, and all are not alike one another, and all of them, low and beautiful, are at first submissive to man and then already become his terrible rulers. Blessed is he who has chosen for himself the most beautiful passion of all; his immeasurable bliss grows and tenfolds every hour and minute, and he enters deeper and deeper into the infinite paradise of his soul. But there are passions whose choice is not from man. They were already born with him at the moment of his birth into the world, and he was not given the strength to deviate from them. They are guided by higher inscriptions, and there is in them something eternally calling, unceasing throughout life. They are destined to complete the earthly great field: it doesn’t matter whether in a gloomy image, or to rush through as a bright phenomenon that rejoices the world, they are equally called for the good unknown to man. And, perhaps, in this same Chichikov, the passion that attracts him is no longer from him, and in his cold existence lies something that will later plunge a person to dust and knees before the wisdom of heaven. And another mystery is why this image appeared in the poem that is now being born.","Crossing himself after the Russian fashion he proceeded to carry it out. On the pretence of looking for a place to settle and other pretexts, he went off to look at various corners of our empire, especially those which had suffered more than others from various misfortunes, such as bad harvests, high rate of mortality and so on, where in fact he might most conveniently and cheaply buy the sort of peasants he wanted. He did not apply to every landowner indiscriminately, but selected those who were most to his taste, or those with whom he found less difficulty in making such bargains, trying first to make their acquaintance and gain their good-will, so as to obtain the peasants through friendship rather than by purchase. And so the reader must not be indignant with the author if the characters who have hitherto appeared are not to his taste , that is Tchitchikov’s fault; here he is completely master and where he thinks fit to take us there we must go. If, however, we do incur censure for the colourlessness and unattractiveness of our characters, we will only say for ourselves that the full scope and magnitude of anything is not to be seen at first. The approach to any town whatever, even to the capital, is always dull and uninteresting; at first everything is grey and monotonous; there are endless strings of smoke-begrimed factories and work-shops, and only afterwards the corners of six-storied houses, shops, signboards, great vistas of streets begin to appear, all with belfrys, columns, statues, and turrets, with the splendour, noise and uproar of the town, and everything that the brain and hand of man has so marvellously devised. How his first purchase took place my readers have seen already. They will see later how things go afterwards, what successes and failures our hero meets with, how he has to overcome more difficult obstacles, how titanic forms appear, how the hidden springs of our great novel move as its horizon spreads wide in the distance, and it takes a grand lyrical direction. The travelling party, consisting of a middle-aged gentleman, a chaise such as bachelors drive in, the valet Petrushka, the coachman Selifan, and the three horses already known to the reader, from the Assessor to the rascally dappled grey, have a long way still to go. And so here we have the full-length portrait of our hero, just as he was! But perhaps the reader will insist on a definite answer in regard to one particular: what sort of man was he as regards moral qualities? That he was not a hero filled with virtues and perfections is evident. What was he then? He must have been a scoundrel, I suppose. Why a scoundrel? Why be so severe to others? There are no scoundrels among us nowadays: there are well-intentioned, agreeable people, but you will scarcely find above two or three men who would risk the public ignominy of a slap in the face, and even those talk about virtue nowadays. It would be more just to call him a good manager, a man bent on making money. Making money is the universal vice: things have been done which the world describes as not very honest for the sake of it. It is true that there is something repellent in such a character, and the very readers who on their way through life would make friends with such a man, would entertain him in their house and spend their time agreeably with him, will look at him askance if he is made the hero of a drama or a poem. But wise is he who does not disdain any character, but probing it with searching eye investigates its primary elements. Everything is rapidly transformed in a man; before you have time to look round, a terrible worm has grown up within him and is sucking all his vital sap. And more than once some passion—not merely a great passion, but some insignificant little propensity for something petty—has sprung up in a man born for better things, has made him forget great and sacred duties and see something great and holy in insignificant baubles. Innumerable as the sands of the sea are the passions of man and all are different, and all, base and noble alike, are first under a man’s control, and afterwards cruel tyrants dominating him. Blessed is the man who has chosen from among them a noble passion: it grows and with every hour and minute increases his immense happiness, and he enters further and further into the infinite paradise of his soul. But there are passions, the choice of which lies not in a man’s hands. They are born with him at the moment of his birth into the world, and he has not been given the strength to turn away from them. They work upon some higher plan, and there is in them something that for ever calls to one and is never silent all one’s life. They are destined to complete the grand pageant of the earth, whether they appear in gloomy, sinister form, or as a bright apparition that rejoices the world—they are equally called up for some good unknown to man. And maybe in this very Tchitchikov, the passion that led him on was not due to him, and in his cold existence there lies hidden what will one day reduce a man to ashes and to his knees before the wisdom of the heavens. And it is another mystery why this type has appeared in the poem that is now seeing the light.","After crossing himself, according to the Russian custom, Chichikov set about carrying out his enterprise. On pretence of selecting a place wherein to settle, he started forth to inspect various corners of the Russian Empire, but more especially those which had suffered from such unfortunate accidents as failures of the harvest, a high rate of mortality, or whatsoever else might enable him to purchase souls at the lowest possible rate. But he did not tackle his landowners haphazard: he rather selected such of them as seemed more particularly suited to his taste, or with whom he might with the least possible trouble conclude identical agreements; though, in the first instance, he always tried, by getting on terms of acquaintanceship—better still, of friendship—with them, to acquire the souls for nothing, and so to avoid purchase at all. In passing, my readers must not blame me if the characters whom they have encountered in these pages have not been altogether to their liking. The fault is Chichikov’s rather than mine, for he is the master, and where he leads we must follow. Also, should my readers gird at me for a certain dimness and want of clarity in my principal characters and actors, that will be tantamount to saying that never do the broad tendency and the general scope of a work become immediately apparent. Similarly does the entry to every town—the entry even to the Capital itself—convey to the traveller such an impression of vagueness that at first everything looks grey and monotonous, and the lines of smoky factories and workshops seem never to be coming to an end; but in time there will begin also to stand out the outlines of six-storied mansions, and of shops and balconies, and wide perspectives of streets, and a medley of steeples, columns, statues, and turrets—the whole framed in rattle and roar and the infinite wonders which the hand and the brain of men have conceived. Of the manner in which Chichikov’s first purchases were made the reader is aware. Subsequently he will see also how the affair progressed, and with what success or failure our hero met, and how Chichikov was called upon to decide and to overcome even more difficult problems than the foregoing, and by what colossal forces the levers of his far-flung tale are moved, and how eventually the horizon will become extended until everything assumes a grandiose and a lyrical tendency. Yes, many a verst of road remains to be travelled by a party made up of an elderly gentleman, a britchka of the kind affected by bachelors, a valet named Petrushka, a coachman named Selifan, and three horses which, from the Assessor to the skewbald, are known to us individually by name. Again, although I have given a full description of our hero’s exterior (such as it is), I may yet be asked for an inclusive definition also of his moral personality. That he is no hero compounded of virtues and perfections must be already clear. Then WHAT is he? A villain? Why should we call him a villain? Why should we be so hard upon a fellow man? In these days our villains have ceased to exist. Rather it would be fairer to call him an ACQUIRER. The love of acquisition, the love of gain, is a fault common to many, and gives rise to many and many a transaction of the kind generally known as “not strictly honourable.” True, such a character contains an element of ugliness, and the same reader who, on his journey through life, would sit at the board of a character of this kind, and spend a most agreeable time with him, would be the first to look at him askance if he should appear in the guise of the hero of a novel or a play. But wise is the reader who, on meeting such a character, scans him carefully, and, instead of shrinking from him with distaste, probes him to the springs of his being. The human personality contains nothing which may not, in the twinkling of an eye, become altogether changed—nothing in which, before you can look round, there may not spring to birth some cankerous worm which is destined to suck thence the essential juice. Yes, it is a common thing to see not only an overmastering passion, but also a passion of the most petty order, arise in a man who was born to better things, and lead him both to forget his greatest and most sacred obligations, and to see only in the veriest trifles the Great and the Holy. For human passions are as numberless as is the sand of the seashore, and go on to become his most insistent of masters. Happy, therefore, the man who may choose from among the gamut of human passions one which is noble! Hour by hour will that instinct grow and multiply in its measureless beneficence; hour by hour will it sink deeper and deeper into the infinite paradise of his soul. But there are passions of which a man cannot rid himself, seeing that they are born with him at his birth, and he has no power to abjure them. Higher powers govern those passions, and in them is something which will call to him, and refuse to be silenced, to the end of his life. Yes, whether in a guise of darkness, or whether in a guise which will become converted into a light to lighten the world, they will and must attain their consummation on life’s field: and in either case they have been evoked for man’s good. In the same way may the passion which drew our Chichikov onwards have been one that was independent of himself; in the same way may there have lurked even in his cold essence something which will one day cause men to humble themselves in the dust before the infinite wisdom of God.","After crossing himself, as Russians do, he went into action. In the guise of looking for a place to live and on other pretexts, he undertook to peek into various corners of our state, mostly those that had suffered more than others from calamities, bad harvests, mortalities, and so on and so forth—in short, where he could more readily and cheaply buy up the sort of folk he wanted. He did not turn at random to just any landowner, but selected people more to his taste or those with whom he would have less difficulty concluding such deals, and he tried first to strike up an acquaintance, to gain favor, so as to acquire the muzhiks, if possible, more through friendship than by purchase. And so, readers ought not to be indignant with the author if the characters who have appeared so far are not to their liking: it is Chichikov’s fault , he is full master here, and wherever he decides to go, we must drag ourselves after him. For our part, if indeed there should fall an accusation of paleness and unsightliness in our characters and persons, we shall say only that in the beginning one never sees the whole broad flow and volume of a thing. The entrance to any town whatever, even a capital, is always somehow pale; at first everything is gray and monotonous: mills and factories all smudged with smoke stretch out endlessly, and only later appear the corners of six-storied buildings, shops, signboards, the immense perspectives of streets, steeples everywhere, columns, statues, towers, with city splendor, noise and thunder, and all that the hand and mind of man have so marvelously brought about. How the first purchases were brought about , the reader has already seen; how matters will develop further, what fortunes and misfortunes await our hero, how he is to solve and surmount more difficult obstacles, how colossal images will emerge, how the secret levers of the vast narrative will work, how its horizon will extend far and wide, and all of it become one majestic lyrical flow—this he will see later. There is still a long way ahead of the whole traveling outfit, consisting of a gentleman of middle age, a britzka such as bachelors drive around in, a lackey Petrushka, a coachman Selifan, and three horses already known by name, from Assessor to the scoundrelly dapple-gray. And so, there you have the whole of our hero, just as he is! But perhaps there will be a demand for a conclusive definition, in one stroke: what is he as regards moral qualities? That he is no hero filled with perfections and virtues is clear. What is he—a scoundrel, then? Why a scoundrel, why be so hard on others? Nowadays we have no scoundrels, we have well-meaning, agreeable people, and of those who, for general disgrace, would offer their physiognomies to be publicly slapped, one can count no more than some two or three men, and they, too, have started talking about virtue. It would be most correct to call him an owner, an acquirer. Acquisition is to blame for everything; because of it things have been done which the world dubs not quite clean. True, there is something repulsive in such a character, and the same reader who on his journey through life would make friends with such a person, welcome him at his table, and pass the time pleasantly, will look askance at him once he becomes the hero of a drama or a poem. But he is wise who does not scorn any character, but, fixing a piercing eye on him, searches out his primary causes. Everything transforms quickly in man; before you can turn around, a horrible worm has grown inside him, despotically drawing all life’s juices to itself. And it has happened more than once that some passion, not a broad but a paltry little passion for some petty thing, has spread through one born for better deeds, making him forsake great and sacred duties and see the great and sacred in paltry baubles. Numberless as the sands of the sea are human passions, and no one resembles another, and all of them, base or beautiful, are at first obedient to man and only later become his dread rulers. Blessed is he who has chosen the most beautiful passion; his boundless bliss grows tenfold with every hour and minute, and he goes deeper and deeper into the infinite paradise of his soul. But there are passions that it is not for man to choose. They are born with him at the moment of his birth into this world, and he is not granted the power to refuse them. They are guided by a higher destiny, and they have in them something eternally calling, never ceasing throughout one’s life. They are ordained to accomplish a great earthly pursuit: as a dark image, or as a bright apparition sweeping by, gladdening the world—it makes no difference, both are equally called forth for the good unknown to man. And it may be that in this same Chichikov the passion that drives him comes not from him, and that his cold existence contains that which will later throw man down in the dust and make him kneel before the wisdom of the heavens. And it is still a mystery why this image has appeared in the poem that is presently coming into being.","Having made the sign of the cross over himself, after the Russian wont, he set about carrying out the scheme. Under the subterfuge of choosing a place of residence and various other pretexts, he made it his business to drop in on various nooks and crannies of our realm and, for preference, those that had suffered more than the others from calamities: poor crops, high mortalities, and the like; in a word, wherever he could buy most conveniently and as cheaply as possible the sort of serfs he needed. He did not tackle just any landowner at random but picked and chose those who were more to his taste or those with whom one could put through such deals with the least difficulty, trying first to form an acquaintanceship, to predispose them in his favor, so that, if possible, he might acquire the dead muzhiks through friendship rather than by purchase. And so the reader must not wax indignant at the author if the personae that have appeared up to now have not proven to his, the reader’s , taste: it’s all Chichikov’s fault; he is full master here, and wherever he may get a notion of going thither must we, too, drag ourselves. For our part, if we should really incur censure for the lack of color in, and the unprepossessing nature of, our personae and characters, we shall merely say that one can never see in the beginning all the wide current and scope of any matter. Entering any town, even though it be a capital, is always a bleak affair; at first everything is drab and monotonous: one comes upon factories and workshops without number, all blackened with smoke, and only thereafter will one glimpse the angles of six-story houses, and shops, and signs, and streets with tremendous perspectives consisting entirely of belfries, columns, statues, towers, with all of a city’s glitter, din, and thunder, and everything that the hand and mind of man have brought forth for man to wonder at. How the first acquisitions were consummated the reader has already seen; how the affair will go on in the future, what the fortunes and misfortunes of our hero will be, how he will have to resolve and overcome still greater obstacles in store for him, how colossal figures will appear, how the hidden levers of a far-flung narrative will move, while its horizon widens still further and it adopts a majestic lyrical flow, these things the reader will see later on. There is still a long road lying ahead of this whole nomadic outfit consisting of one gentleman of middle age, a light carriage of the sort that bachelors prefer to drive about in, Petrushka the flunky, Selifan the coachman, and the trio of horses, which the reader is now familiar with by name, from Assessor to that scoundrel of a piebald. And so there’s our hero, warts and all, just as he is! But perhaps the demand may be made to define him conclusively through a single trait: just what sort of a man is he as far as moral qualities are concerned? That he is not a hero full of perfections and virtues is self-evident. What is he, then? He must be a scoundrel, in that case. But why a scoundrel? After all, why be so severe toward others? There are no scoundrels among us nowadays: there are only well-intentioned, pleasant people, while as for those who would risk general disgrace by doing something for which their physiognomies might be slapped in public, why, you find only some two or three such, and even they are talking about virtue nowadays. The most just thing of all would be to call him a “proprietor,” an “acquirer.” Acquisition is the root of all evil; because of it deals have been put through upon which the world has bestowed the description of being “none too clean.” True, there is about such a character a something actually repellent, and the very same reader who on the road he pursues through life will be friendly with a man like that, will gladly have him as a frequent guest at his hospitable board and will spend the time pleasantly with him, will start eyeing him askance if the same fellow turns up as the hero of a drama or an epic. But wise is he who does not disdain any character but, fixing him with a searching gaze, investigates him down to his primary causes. Everything transforms itself quickly in man; before one has a chance to turn around there has already grown up within him a fearful cankerworm that has imperiously diverted all his life-sap to itself. And more than once, some passion—not merely some sweeping, grand longing, but a mean, sneaky yen for something insignificant—has developed in a man born for great deeds, making him forget great and sacred obligations and see something great and sacred in insignificant gewgaws. As countless as the sands of the sea are the passions of man, and no one of them resembles another, and all of them, the base and the splendidly beautiful, are in the beginning submissive to the will of man and only later on become fearful tyrants dominating him. Blessed is he that hath chosen for himself the most splendidly beautiful of all passions: his boundless bliss grows and increases tenfold with every hour and every minute, and he penetrates deeper and deeper into the infinite paradise of his soul. But there are passions the choice of which is not of man’s volition. For they were already born with him at the moment of his being born into the world, and he has not been given the strength to deviate from them. They are guided by designs from above, these passions, and there is in them something eternally summoning, something that is not stilled all life long. A great earthly course are they fated to perform, it is all one whether in a somber guise or flashing by as a radiant phenomenon that makes the world rejoice—they are equally called forth for a good that man is ignorant of. And perhaps, in this very Chichikov, the passion that is drawing him on is not of his choosing, and in his chill existence is contained that which will cast man down into the dust and on his knees before the wisdom of the heavens. And it is still a mystery why this form has arisen in the epic now seeing the light of day."

"— Да ведь соболезнование в карман не положишь, — сказал Плюшкин. — Вот возле меня живет капитан; черт знает его, откуда взялся, говорит — родственник: «Дядюшка, дядюшка!» — и в руку целует, а как начнет соболезновать, вой такой подымет, что уши береги. С лица весь красный: пеннику, чай, насмерть придерживается. Верно, спустил денежки, служа в офицерах, или театральная актриса выманила, так вот он теперь и соболезнует!","""But you can't put condolences in your pocket,"" said Plyushkin. “The captain lives near me; the devil knows where he came from, says - a relative: ""Uncle, uncle!"" - and kisses on the hand, and as soon as he begins to sympathize, he will raise such a howl that take care of your ears. All red from the face: penniku, tea, adheres to death. That's right, he lost money while serving as an officer, or the theater actress lured him out, and so now he sympathizes!","“But sympathy is nothing you can put in your pocket,” said Plyushkin. “Here there is a captain living near, the devil knows where he has come from; he says he is a relation. It’s ‘uncle,’ all the time, and he kisses my hand; and when he begins sympathising he sets up such a howl that one wants to stuff one’s fingers in one’s ears. He is all red in the face; he’s too fond of good brandy, I’ll be bound. No doubt he wasted his money, being an officer, or some stage actress turned his head, so now he has to sympathise!”","“But sympathy does not put anything into one’s pocket,” retorted Plushkin. “For instance, I have a kinsman who is constantly plaguing me. He is a captain in the army, damn him, and all day he does nothing but call me ‘dear uncle,’ and kiss my hand, and express sympathy until I am forced to stop my ears. You see, he has squandered all his money upon his brother-officers, as well as made a fool of himself with an actress; so now he spends his time in telling me that he has a sympathetic heart!”","“But condolence can’t be put in the pocket,” said Plyushkin. “There’s this captain in the neighborhood, devil knows where he came from, says he’s my relative—‘Uncle! Uncle!’ and kisses my hand—and once he starts his condoling, hold your ears, he sets up such a howl. He’s all red in the face: keeps a deathly grip on the home brew, I expect. Must have blown all his cash serving as an officer, or else some theater actress lured it out of him, so now he’s here condoling!”","“Yes, but commiseration isn’t anything you can put in your pocket,” Pliushkin remarked. “There, now, there’s a certain captain lives near me, the Devil knows where he has bobbed up from; he says he’s a relative of mine. ‘ Dear Uncle, dear Uncle!’—and he kisses my hand. Well, when he starts in commiserating, he’ll set up such a howl that you’d better watch out for your ears. His face is all ruddy—he must be clinging to strong brandy for dear life, I guess. Probably he squandered every copper he had at the time he was serving as an officer, or some play-acting jade wheedled everything out of him, so now he’s taken to commiserating!”"

"— Да, точно, это у Деребина Вахрамей. Вообрази, Деребину какое счастье: тетка его поссорилась с сыном за то, что женился на крепостной, и теперь записала ему все именье. Я думаю себе, вот если бы эдакую тетку иметь для дальнейших! Да что ты, брат, так отдалился от всех, нигде не бываешь? Конечно, я знаю, что ты занят иногда учеными предметами, любишь читать (уж почему Ноздрев заключил, что герой наш занимается учеными предметами и любит почитать, этого, признаемся, мы никак не можем сказать, а Чичиков и того менее). Ах, брат Чичиков, если бы ты только увидал… вот уж, точно, была бы пища твоему сатирическому уму (почему у Чичикова был сатирический ум, это тоже неизвестно). Вообрази, брат, у купца Лихачева играли в горку, вот уж где смех был! Перепендев, который был со мною: «Вот, говорит, если бы теперь Чичиков, уж вот бы ему точно!..» (между тем Чичиков отроду не знал никакого Перепендева). А ведь признайся, брат, ведь ты, право, преподло поступил тогда со мною, помнишь, как играли в шашки, ведь я выиграл… Да, брат, ты просто поддедюлил меня. Но ведь я, черт меня знает, никак не могу сердиться. Намедни с председателем… Ах, да! я ведь тебе должен сказать, что в городе все против тебя; они думают, что ты делаешь фальшивые бумажки, пристали ко мне, да я за тебя горой, наговорил им, что с тобой учился и отца знал; ну и, уж нечего говорить, слил им пулю порядочную.","- Yes, exactly, this is Derebin Vakhramei. Imagine how happy Derebin is: his aunt quarreled with her son for marrying a serf, and now she has written down all the estate to him. I think to myself, if only I could have such an aunt for further! What are you, brother, so far away from everyone, do not go anywhere? Of course, I know that you are sometimes busy with scientific subjects, you like to read (why Nozdryov concluded that our hero is engaged in scientific subjects and loves to read, we admit that we can’t say this at all, and Chichikov even less). Ah, brother Chichikov, if only you could see... surely there would be food for your satirical mind (why Chichikov had a satirical mind is also unknown). Imagine, brother, they were playing uphill at the merchant Likhachev's, that's where the laughter was! Perependev, who was with me: “Here, he says, if now Chichikov, he would certainly be! ..” (Meanwhile, Chichikov had never known any Perependev from his childhood). But admit it, brother, you really acted meanly then with me, remember how they played checkers, because I won ... Yes, brother, you just screwed me. But I, the devil knows me, can't get angry. The other day with the chairman ... Oh, yes! I must tell you that everyone in the city is against you; they think that you are making fake papers, stuck to me, but I am for you a mountain, told them that I studied with you and knew my father; well, there’s nothing to say, he poured a decent bullet into them.","“Oh yes, it is at Derebin’s that there is a Vahramey. Only fancy, what luck for Derebin: his aunt has quarrelled with her son because he has married a serf girl, and now she has left him all her property. I thought to myself if only one could have an aunt like that for the sake of the future! But how is it, old man, you have kept away from all of us and have not been near any one? Of course I know you are sometimes engaged in abstruse studies, you are fond of reading” (on what ground Nozdryov believed that Tchitchikov was engaged in abstruse subjects and was fond of reading we must own we cannot tell, and still less could Tchitchikov). “Ah, Tchitchikov, old man, if you had only seen . . . it really would have been a subject for your sarcastic wit” (why Tchitchikov was supposed to have a sarcastic wit is unknown also). “Only fancy, old boy, we were having a game of cards at the merchant Lihatchev‘s, and didn’t we have fun there too! Perependev who was with me, ’If only Tchitchikov were here,‘ said he, ’it would be just the thing for him....‘ ” (Tchitchikov had never known any one called Perependev in his life.) “But you must own up, old boy, you did play me a nasty trick, do you remember, over that game of draughts? I won it, you know ... Yes, old man, you simply did me over that. But there I don’t know how the devil it is but I can’t be cross. The other day at the president’s . . . Ah, yes, I ought to tell you every one in the town is turned against you. They imagine you forge notes. They kept pestering me about you, I stood up for you like a rock —I told them I had been to school with you and knew your father; and there, there’s no denying I pitched them a fine tale.”","Then it must be Derebin’s man I am thinking of. What a lucky fellow that Derebin is! An aunt of his has gone and quarrelled with her son for marrying a serf woman, and has left all her property to HIM, to Derebin. Would that I had an aunt of that kind to provide against future contingencies! But why have you been hiding yourself away? I suppose the reason has been that you go in for abstruse subjects and are fond of reading” (why Nozdrev should have drawn these conclusions no one could possibly have said—least of all Chichikov himself). “By the way, I can tell you of something that would have found you scope for your satirical vein” (the conclusion as to Chichikov’s “satirical vein” was, as before, altogether unwarranted on Nozdrev’s part). “That is to say, you would have seen merchant Likhachev losing a pile of money at play. My word, you would have laughed! A fellow with me named Perependev said: ‘Would that Chichikov had been here! It would have been the very thing for him!’” (As a matter of fact, never since the day of his birth had Nozdrev met any one of the name of Perependev.) “However, my friend, you must admit that you treated me rather badly the day that we played that game of chess; but, as I won the game, I bear you no malice. A propos, I am just from the President’s, and ought to tell you that the feeling against you in the town is very strong, for every one believes you to be a forger of currency notes. I myself was sent for and questioned about you, but I stuck up for you through thick and thin, and told the tchinovniks that I had been at school with you, and had known your father.","“Right, exactly, it’s Derebin who has a Vakhramey. Imagine Derebin’s luck: his aunt quarreled with her son for marrying a serf girl, and now she’s willed him her whole estate. I’m thinking to myself, it wouldn’t be bad to have such an aunt for further on! But what’s with you, brother, you’re so withdrawn from everybody, you don’t go anywhere? Of course, I know you’re sometimes occupied with learned subjects, you like to read” (what made Nozdryov conclude that our hero occupied himself with learned subjects and liked to read, we must confess, we simply cannot say, and still less could Chichikov). “Ah, brother Chichikov, if only you’d seen it … that really would have been food for your satirical mind” (why Chichikov should have a satirical mind is also unknown). “Imagine, brother, we were playing a game of brag at the merchant Likhachev’s, and how we laughed! Perependev, who was with me, ‘You know,’ he says, ‘if it was Chichikov now, you know, he’d really …!’ ” (while never in his born days did Chichikov know any Perependev). “And confess, brother, you really did me the meanest turn that time, remember, when we were playing checkers, because I really did win … Yes, brother, you just diddled me out of it. But, devil knows what it is with me, I can never be angry. The other day with the magistrate … Ah, yes! I must tell you, the whole town’s against you; they think you make forged bills, they started pestering me, but I stood up for you like a rock , I told them a heap of things, that I went to school with you and knew your father; well, needless to say , I spun them a good yarn.”","“Yes, that’s right; it’s Derebin who owns a Vakhramei. Imagine what luck this Derebin has: his aunt has quarreled with her son because he married a serf, and now she has willed all her estate to Derebin. ‘There,’ I thinks to myself, ‘if only one were to have an aunt like that for one’s future needs!’ But I say, brother, why have you withdrawn yourself like that from everybody, why don’t you go anywhere? Of course I know that you’re at times taken up with scientific studies, that you’re fond of reading.” (Just why Nozdrev had concluded that our hero was taken up with scientific matters and was fond of reading, we must confess we cannot tell, and Chichikov would be still less likely to.) “Ah, brother Chichikov! If you had but seen .. . there, now, really, you would have found food for your satirical mind!” (Just how Chichikov had come to have a satirical mind is likewise unknown.) “Just imagine, we were playing cards at the house of Likhachev the merchant, and what an amusing time we had! Perependev was with me. ‘ There,’ he says, ‘if only Chichikov were here, why, this would be just the thing for him! .. .’ “ (And yet Chichikov had never in all his born days known any Perependev.) “But own up, now, brother—why, you acted most abominably toward me that time, you remember, when we were playing checkers! For I had won. Yes, brother, you simply diddled me that time. But then, may the Devil take me, I simply can’t bear a grudge. Just the other day, at the house of the Chairman of the Administrative Offices ... Ah, yes! I must really tell you that the whole town has turned against you. They think that you’re turning out counterfeit bank notes; they started pestering me, but I stood up for you as firm as a rock; I told ’em a great deal about you, that I’d gone to school with you and had known your father. Well, there’s no use talking even , I spun them a fine yarn.”"
"А между тем его ожидало другое зрелище. Узнавши о приезде барина, населенье всей деревни собралося к крыльцу. Пестрые платки, повязки, повойники, зипуны, бороды всех родов: заступом, лопатой и клином, рыжие, русые и белые, как серебро, покрыли всю площадь. Мужики загремели: «Кормилец, дождались мы тебя!» Бабы заголосили: «Золото, серебро ты сердечное!» Стоявшие подале даже подрались от усердья продраться. Дряблая старушонка, похожая на сушеную грушу, прошмыгнула промеж ног других, подступила к нему, всплеснула руками и взвизгнула: «Соплюнчик ты наш, да какой же ты жиденький! изморила тебя окаянная немчура!» — «Пошла ты, баба! — закричали ей тут же бороды заступом, лопатой и клином. — Ишь куды полезла, корявая!» Кто-то приворотил к этому такое словцо, от которого один только русский мужик мог не засмеяться. Барин не выдержал и рассмеялся, но тем не менее он тронут был глубоко в душе своей. «Столько любви! и за что? — думал он в себе. — За то, что я никогда не видал их, никогда не занимался ими! Отныне же даю слово разделить с вами труды и занятья ваши! Употреблю все, чтобы помочь вам сделаться тем, чем вы должны быть, чем вам назначила быть ваша добрая, внутри вас же самих заключенная природа ваша, чтобы не даром была любовь ваша ко мне, чтобы я, точно, был кормилец ваш!»","Meanwhile, another sight awaited him. Having learned about the arrival of the master, the population of the whole village gathered to the porch. Colorful scarves, headbands, warriors, zipuns, beards of all kinds: with a spade, a spade and a wedge, red, fair-haired and white as silver, covered the entire area. The men thundered: “Breadwinner, we waited for you!” The women shouted: “Gold, silver, you are hearty!” Those standing at a distance even fought from zeal to get through. A flabby old woman, resembling a dried pear, slipped between the legs of the others, stepped up to him, clapped her hands and squealed: “You are our snot, but what a thin you are! the cursed nemchura has worn you out!” “Go ahead, grandma! the beards immediately shouted at her with a spade, a shovel and a wedge. “Look where you got, clumsy!” Someone has turned to this such a word, from which only a Russian peasant could not laugh. The master could not stand it and laughed, but nevertheless he was touched deep in his soul. “So much love! and for what? he thought to himself. “Because I never saw them, never studied them!” From now on, I give you my word to share your labors and your occupations with you! I will use everything to help you become what you should be, what your kind nature has appointed you to be, your nature is enclosed within you, so that your love for me will not be in vain, so that I, for sure, will be your breadwinner!","And meanwhile, another spectacle was awaiting him. Hearing of the master’s arrival the population of the whole village had gathered at the entrance. Bright-coloured kerchiefs, sashes, headbands, full-skirted coats, beards of all shapes—shovel, spade, wedge-shaped, red, fair, and white as silver, covered the whole court in front of the house. The peasants boomed out: “Our dead master, we have lived to see you again!”The women chanted: “Thou golden one, silver of our hearts!” Those who stood further off actually began fighting to get nearer. A decrepit little old woman who looked like a dried pear, darted between the legs of the others, stepped up to him, clasped her hands and shrieked: “Our nurseling! But how thin you are! the accursed foreigners have worn you out!” “Get away, woman!” the beards, shovel, spade, and wedge-shaped, shouted to her. “Where are you shoving to, you shrivelled thing?” Some one added to this an expression at which only a Russian peasant could help laughing. Andrey Ivanovitch could not refrain from laughter, but nevertheless he was deeply touched at heart. “How much love, and what for?” he thought to himself, “in return for my never having seen them, never having troubled about them! I swear from to-day that I will share your labours and your toils! I will do everything to help you to become what you ought to be, what the goodness innate in you meant you to be—that your love for me may not be for nothing, that I really may be a good master to you!”","Meanwhile another spectacle was being prepared for him. On learning that the barin was approaching the mansion, the muzhiks collected on the verandah in very variety of picturesque dress and tonsure; and when these good folk surrounded him, and there arose a resounding shout of “Here is our Foster Father! He has remembered us!” and, in spite of themselves, some of the older men and women began weeping as they recalled his grandfather and great-grandfather, he himself could not restrain his tears, but reflected: “How much affection! And in return for what? In return for my never having come to see them—in return for my never having taken the least interest in their affairs!” And then and there he registered a mental vow to share their every task and occupation.","And meanwhile another spectacle awaited him. Having learned of the master’s arrival, the population of the entire village gathered by the porch. Gay-colored kerchiefs, headbands, scarfs, homespun coats, beards of all sorts—spade, shovel, wedge-shaped, red, blond, and white as silver—covered the whole square. The muzhiks boomed out: “Our provider, we’ve waited so long!” The women wailed: “Gold, the heart’s silver!” Those who stood further away even fought in their zeal to press forward. A wobbly crone who looked like a dried pear crept between the others’ legs, accosted him, clasped her hands, and shrieked: “Our little runny-nose, what a weakling you are! the cursed Germans have starved you out!” “Away with you, granny!” the spade, shovel, and wedge-shaped beards all shouted at her. “Watch where you’re shoving, you old scraggy one!” Someone tacked on a little word, at which only a Russian peasant could keep from laughing. The master could not help himself and laughed, but nevertheless he was deeply touched in his soul. “So much love! and what for?” he thought to himself. “For never having seen them, for never concerning myself with them! I give my word that henceforth I will share all your labors and concerns with you! I’ll do everything to help you become what you ought to be, what the good nature that is in you meant you to be, so that your love for me will not be in vain, so that I will indeed be your provider!”",

Indeed, on one occasion I, with my own hands, caught a hare by the hind legs.”","“In this field here,” said Nozdryov, pointing his finger at the field, “it’s so thick with hares you can’t see the ground; I myself caught one by the hind legs with my bare hands.”","“On that field there,” said Nozdrev, pointing his finger at a field, “there’s such an awful lot of winter hares that you can’t see the ground for them; I myself caught one by his hind legs with my bare hands.”"
"— Он к тому не допустит, он сам приедет, — сказал Чичиков, и в то же время подумал в себе: «Генералы пришлись, однако же, кстати; между тем ведь язык совершенно взболтнул сдуру».","""He won't allow it to happen, he'll come himself,"" said Chichikov, and at the same time he thought to himself: ""The generals have come, however, by the way; meanwhile, after all, the language has completely shaken up foolishly.","“He would not think of allowing that, he will come himself,” said Tchitchikov, while he thought to himself, “the generals came in pat; though I was gagging away quite at random.”","“Never would he permit that, your Excellency. He would greatly prefer to be the first to make advances.” And Chichikov added to himself: “What a stroke of luck those Generals were!","“He wouldn’t allow that, he’ll come to you,” Chichikov said, and at the same time thought to himself: “The generals came in nicely; and yet my tongue just stupidly blurted it out.”",

Acknowledging their greeting with a slight bow, the prince began:","An hour later the Governor-General issued to all and sundry officials a notice that, on the occasion of his departure for St. Petersburg, he would be glad to see the corps of tchinovniks at a private meeting. Accordingly all ranks and grades of officialdom repaired to his residence, and there awaited—not without a certain measure of trepidation and of searching of heart—the Governor-General’s entry. When that took place he looked neither clear nor dull. Yet his bearing was proud, and his step assured.

"— Направо, — сказал мужик. — Это будет тебе дорога в Маниловку; а Заманиловки никакой нет. Она зовется так, то есть ее прозвание Маниловка, а Заманиловки тут вовсе нет. Там прямо на горе увидишь дом, каменный, в два этажа, господский дом, в котором, то есть, живет сам господин. Вот это тебе и есть Маниловка, а Заманиловки совсем нет никакой здесь и не было.","“To the right,” said the man. - This will be your way to Manilovka; and there is no lure. She is called so, that is, her nickname is Manilovka, and Zamanilovka is not here at all. There, right on the mountain, you will see a house, stone, two stories high, the manor's house, in which, that is, the master himself lives. This is what Manilovka is for you, and there is no Zamanilovka at all here and never was.","“To the right,” said the peasant. “That will be your road to Manilovka; but there is no such place as Zamanilovka. That is what it is called, its name is Manilovka, but as for Zamanilovka there is no such place here about. There straight before you on the hill you will see the house, built of brick, two storeys high—the manor house, that is, where the gentleman himself lives. There you have Manilovka, but there is no Zamanilovka here and never has been.”","“Yes, on the right,” affirmed the peasant. “You are on the proper road for Manilovka, but ZAmanilovka—well, there is no such place. The house you mean is called Manilovka because Manilovka is its name; but no house at all is called ZAmanilovka. The house you mean stands there, on that hill, and is a stone house in which a gentleman lives, and its name is Manilovka; but ZAmanilovka does not stand hereabouts, nor ever has stood.”","“To the right,” said the muzhik. “That’ll be your road to Manilovka; and there’s no such place as Zamanilovka. That’s her name, I mean, she’s called Manilovka, and there’s no Zamanilovka at all hereabouts. Right there on the hill you’ll see a house, a stone house, two stories, a master’s house, I mean, where the master himself lives. That’s your Manilovka, and there’s never been any such Zamanilovka around here at all.”","“To the right,” said the muzhik. “That will be your road to Manilovka; as for Zamanilovka, there ain’t no such place whatsoever. That’s what it’s called—it goes by the name of Manilovka, that is; but there ain’t no Zamanilovka hereabouts at all. When you get there, you’ll see a house up on a hill, of stone, two-storied—the manor that is, where the squire himself lives. And that there is your Manilovka; but as for Zamanilovka, there ain’t no such place whatsoever hereabouts, nor ever has been.”"

"Поутру, ранее даже того времени, которое назначено в городе N. для визитов, из дверей оранжевого деревянного дома с мезонином и голубыми колоннами выпорхнула дама в клетчатом щегольском клоке,[19] сопровождаемая лакеем в шинели с несколькими воротниками и золотым галуном на круглой лощеной шляпе. Дама вспорхнула в тот же час с необыкновенною поспешностью по откинутым ступенькам в стоявшую у подъезда коляску. Лакей тут же захлопнул даму дверцами, закидал ступеньками и ухватясь за ремни сзади коляски, закричал кучеру: «Пошел!» Дама везла только что услышанную новость и чувствовала побуждение непреодолимое скорее сообщить ее. Всякую минуту выглядывала она из окна и видела, к несказанной досаде, что все еще остается полдороги. Всякий дом казался ей длиннее обыкновенного; белая каменная богадельня с узенькими окнами тянулась нестерпимо долго, так что она наконец не вытерпела не сказать: «Проклятое строение, и конца нет!» Кучер уже два раза получил приказание: «Поскорее, поскорее, Андрюшка! ты сегодня несносно долго едешь!» Наконец цель была достигнута. Коляска остановилась перед деревянным же одноэтажным домом темно-серого цвета, с белыми барельефчиками над окнами, с высокою деревянною решеткою перед самыми окнами и узеньким палисадником, за решеткою которого находившиеся тоненькие деревца побелели от никогда не сходившей с них городской пыли. В окнах мелькали горшки с цветами, попугай, качавшийся в клетке, уцепясь носом за кольцо, и две собачонки, спавшие перед солнцем. В этом доме жила искренняя приятельница приехавшей дамы. Автор чрезвычайно затрудняется, как назвать ему обеих дам таким образом, чтобы опять не рассердились на него, как серживались встарь. Назвать выдуманною фамилией опасно. Какое ни придумай имя, уж непременно найдется в каком-нибудь углу нашего государства, благо велико, кто-нибудь, носящий его, и непременно рассердится не на живот, а на смерть, станет говорить, что автор нарочно приезжал секретно, с тем чтобы выведать все, что он такое сам, и в каком тулупчике ходит, и к какой Аграфене Ивановне наведывается, и что любит покушать. Назови же по чинам — боже сохрани, и того опасней. Теперь у нас все чины и сословия так раздражены, что все, что ни есть в печатной книге, уже кажется им личностью: таково уж, видно, расположенье в воздухе. Достаточно сказать только, что есть в одном городе глупый человек, это уже и личность; вдруг выскочит господин почтенной наружности и закричит: «Ведь я тоже человек, стало быть, я тоже глуп», — словом, вмиг смекнет, в чем дело. А потому, для избежания всего этого, будем называть даму к которой приехала гостья, так, как она называлась почти единогласно в городе N.: именно, дамою приятною во всех отношениях. Это название она приобрела законным образом, ибо, точно, ничего не пожалела, чтобы сделаться любезною в последней степени, хотя, конечна, сквозь любезность прокрадывалась ух какая яркая прыть женского характера! и хотя подчас в каждом приятном слове ее торчала ух какая булавка! а уж не приведи бог, что кипело в сердце против той, которая бы пролезла как-нибудь и чем-нибудь в первые. Но все это было облечено самою тонкою светскостью, какая только бывает в губернском городе. Всякие движения производила она со вкусом, даже любила стихи, даже иногда мечтательно умела держать голову, — и все согласились, что она, точно, дама приятная во всех отношениях. Другая же дама, то есть приехавшая, не имела такой многосторонности в характере, и потому будем называть ее: просто приятная дама. Приезд гостьи разбудил собачонок, сиявших на солнце: мохнатую Адель, беспрестанно путавшуюся в собственной шерсти, и кобелька Попури на тоненьких ножках. Тот и другая с лаем понесли кольцами хвосты свои в переднюю, где гостья освобождалась от своего клока и очутилась в платье модного узора и цвета и в длинных хвостах на шее; жасмины понеслись по всей комнате. Едва только во всех отношениях приятная дама узнала о приезде просто приятной дамы, как уже вбежала в переднюю. Дамы ухватились за руки, поцеловались и вскрикнули, как вскрикивают институтки, встретившиеся вскоре после выпуска, когда маменьки еще не успели объяснить им, что отец у одной беднее и ниже чином, нежели у другой. Поцелуй совершился звонко, потому что собачонки залаяли снова, за что были хлопнуты платком, и обе ламы отправились в гостиную, разумеется голубую, с диваном, овальным столом и даже ширмочками, обвитыми плющом; вслед за ними побежали, ворча, мохнатая Адель и высокий Попури на тоненьких ножках. «Сюда, сюда, вот в этот уголочек! — говорила хозяйка, усаживая гостью в угол дивана. — Вот так! вот так! вот вам и подушка!» Сказавши это, она запихнула ей за спину подушку, на которой был вышит шерстью рыцарь таким образом, как их всегда вышивают по канве: нос вышел лестницею, а губы четвероугольником. «Как же я рада, что вы… Я слышу, кто-то подъехал, да думаю себе, кто бы мог так рано. Параша говорит: „вице-губернаторша“, а я говорю: „ну вот, опять приехала дура надоедать“, и уж хотела сказать, что меня нет дома…»","In the morning, even before the time appointed in the city of N. for visits, a lady in a smart checkered tuft fluttered out of the door of an orange wooden house with a mezzanine and blue columns, [19] accompanied by a footman in an overcoat with several collars and gold lace on a round polished hat . The lady fluttered at the same hour with extraordinary haste up the retracted steps into a carriage standing at the entrance. The footman immediately slammed the door on the lady, threw the stairs over him and, grabbing the straps at the back of the carriage, shouted to the coachman: ""Let's go!"" The lady was carrying the news she had just heard and felt an irresistible impulse to tell her as soon as possible. Every minute she looked out of the window and saw, to indescribable annoyance, that there was still half the road left. Every house seemed to her longer than usual; the white stone almshouse with narrow windows dragged on for an unbearably long time, so that she finally could not bear not to say: “A damned building, and there is no end!” The coachman has already twice received the order: “Hurry, hurry, Andryushka! You're taking an unbearably long ride today!"" Finally the goal was reached. The carriage stopped in front of a wooden one-story house of a dark gray color, with white bas-reliefs above the windows, with a high wooden lattice in front of the very windows and a narrow front garden, behind the lattice of which the thin trees were whitened from the city dust that never descended from them. Pots of flowers flashed through the windows, a parrot swaying in a cage, clinging to the ring with its nose, and two little dogs sleeping in the sun. A sincere friend of the visiting lady lived in this house. The author finds it extremely difficult how to call both ladies to him in such a way that they will not be angry with him again, as they were angry of old. Calling a fictitious name is dangerous. Whatever name you come up with, it will certainly be found in some corner of our state, the blessing is great, someone who wears it, and will certainly be angry not with his stomach, but with death, will begin to say that the author came on purpose secretly in order to find out everything that he himself is, and in what sheepskin coat he goes, and what Agrafena Ivanovna visits, and what he likes to eat. Call me by rank - God forbid, even more dangerous. Now all the ranks and estates are so irritated among us that everything that is in a printed book already seems to them a person: such, apparently, is the disposition in the air. It is enough to say only that there is a stupid person in one city, this is already a person; suddenly a gentleman of respectable appearance jumps out and shouts: “After all, I am also a man, therefore, I am also stupid,” in a word, he will instantly realize what the matter is. And therefore, in order to avoid all this, we will call the lady to whom the guest came, as she was called almost unanimously in the city of N .: namely, a lady pleasant in all respects. She acquired this name in a legitimate way, for, as if, she spared nothing in order to become amiable to the last degree, although, of course, what a bright agility of a female character crept through amiability! and although sometimes in every pleasant word she stuck out, oh what a pin! and God forbid, what was seething in the heart against the one that would somehow and somehow crawl into the first. But all this was clothed with the most subtle secularism, which only happens in a provincial town. She made all kinds of movements with taste, she even loved poetry, she even sometimes dreamily knew how to hold her head - and everyone agreed that she was, in fact, a lady pleasant in all respects. The other lady, that is, the one who arrived, did not have such versatility in character, and therefore we will call her: simply a pleasant lady. The arrival of the guest woke up the little dogs, shining in the sun: the shaggy Adele, who was constantly tangled in her own fur, and the dog Potpuri on thin legs. The one and the other, barking, carried their tails in rings into the anteroom, where the guest freed herself from her tuft and found herself in a dress of fashionable pattern and color and in long tails around her neck; jasmine rushed all over the room. As soon as the pleasant lady in all respects learned about the arrival of the simply pleasant lady, she already ran into the hall. The ladies clutched their hands, kissed each other, and cried out, as college girls who meet shortly after graduation, when their mothers had not had time to explain to them, that the father of one is poorer and lower in rank than the other, scream. The kiss was completed loudly, because the little dogs barked again, for which they were clapped with a handkerchief, and both lamas went into the living room, blue, of course, with a sofa, an oval table, and even screens entwined with ivy; furry Adele and tall Potpuri on slender legs ran after them, grumbling. “Here, here, in this corner! - said the hostess, seating the guest in the corner of the sofa. - Like this! like this! Here's a pillow for you! Having said this, she pushed a pillow behind her back, on which a knight was embroidered with wool in the way they are always embroidered on canvas: the nose came out in a ladder, and the lips in a quadrangle. “How glad I am that you ... I hear someone drove up, but I think to myself who could have done it so early. Parasha says: “vice-governor”, and I say: “well, the fool has come again to annoy”, and I already wanted to say that I was not at home ... ""","In the morning, earlier than the hour usually fixed for calls in the town of N., a lady in a smart checked cloak darted out of the door of an orange-coloured wooden house with a mezzanine and blue columns. She was escorted by a footman in a livery coat, with many collars and gold braid on his round, shining hat. With unusual haste the lady at once skipped up the lowered steps of a carriage that stood at the door. The footman instantly slammed the carriage door, pulled up the steps and catching hold of a strap at the back of the carriage, shouted to the coachman: “Off! ” The lady was taking with her a piece of news she had only just heard, and was conscious of an irresistible longing to communicate it as soon as possible. She was every minute looking out of the window and seeing to her unspeakable vexation that they had only gone half-way. Every house seemed longer than usual; the white almshouse with its narrow windows seemed interminable, so that at last she could not resist saying: “ The confounded building, there is no end to it.” Already twice the coachman had received the order: “Make haste, make haste, Andryushka! You are insufferably slow to-day.” At last the goal was reached. The carriage stopped before a dark grey wooden house of one storey, with little white bas-reliefs above the windows, and high trellis fences just in front of the windows, and a narrow little front garden, in which the slender trees were always white with the dust of the town that covered their leaves. In the windows could be seen pots of flowers, a parrot swinging in a cage and holding the ring in its beak, and two lap-dogs asleep in the sun. In this house lived the lady’s bosom friend. The author is extremely perplexed how to name these ladies in such a way as to avoid exciting an outburst of anger, as he has done in the past. To call them by a fictitious surname is dangerous. Whatever name one thinks of, in some corner of our empire—well-called great—some one is sure to be found bearing it, and he is bound to be not slightly but mortally offended, and will declare that the author has secretly paid a visit to the neighbourhood on purpose to find out what he is like, and what sort of a sheepskin he wears, and what Agrafena Ivanovna he visits, and what he likes best to eat. As for speaking of them by their rank in the service, God forbid, that is more dangerous still. All grades and classes now are so mortally sensitive, that everything they find in a book seems to them a personality: apparently this sensitiveness is in the air. It is enough to say that in a certain town there is a stupid man— even that is a personality: a gentleman of respectable appearance will pop up at once and cry out, “Why, I am a man too, so it seems I am stupid”; in fact he perceives at once what is meant. And so in order to avoid all this I will call the lady to whom the visit was made, as she was almost unanimously called in the town of N., that is, a lady agreeable in every respect. She had gained this appellation quite legitimately, for she certainly spared no effort to be obliging in the extreme, although of course through that amiability there stole a glimpse of—oh! what a swift rush of femininity!—and even in her most agreeable phrase would be thrust— oh! what a sharp pin! And God forbid that she should be moved to fury against some one who had somehow poked herself in some way in front of her. But all this would be wrapped up in the most refined politeness such as is only found in provincial towns. Every movement she made was with good taste, she was even fond of poetry; and could hold her head pensively, and every one agreed that she really was a lady agreeable in every respect. The other lady, that is, the visitor, had not a character so many-sided, and so we will call her the simply agreeable lady. The arrival of the visitor woke the dogs that were sleeping in the sun: shaggy Adèle, always entangled in her own coat, and thin-legged Potpourri.db Both began describing circles with their tails in the hall where the visitor, divested of her cloak, appeared in a dress of fashionable design and colour with long streamers from her neck; a scent of jasmine was wafted all over the hall. As soon as the lady agreeable in all respects heard of the arrival of the simply agreeable lady, she ran out into the hall. The ladies grasped each other’s hands, kissed each other and screamed as schoolgirls scream on meeting again after a holiday, before their mothers have managed to explain to them that one is poorer and of a lower rank than another. The kiss was a noisy one, for the dogs began barking again, and were flicked with a handkerchief for doing so, and both of the ladies went off into the drawing-room, which was, of course, pale blue, with a sofa, an oval table and even a little screen with ivy climbing up it; shaggy Adèle and tall Potpourri on his slender legs ran in after them growling. “This way, this way, sit in this corner!” said the lady of the house, installing her friend in the corner of the sofa. “That’s right , that’s right , and here is a cushion for you.” Saying this, she stuffed a cushion in behind her, on which there was a knight worked in wool, as such figures always are worked on canvas, with a nose looking like a ladder and lips forming a square. “How glad I am that it’s you.... I heard some one drive up and I wondered who it could be so early. Parasha said, ‘It’s the vice-president’s lady,’ and I said, ‘There, here’s that silly creature come to bore me again,’ and I was on the point of telling them to say I was not at home.”","Next morning, before the usual hour for paying calls, there tripped from the portals of an orange-coloured wooden house with an attic storey and a row of blue pillars a lady in an elegant plaid cloak. With her came a footman in a many-caped greatcoat and a polished top hat with a gold band. Hastily, but gracefully, the lady ascended the steps let down from a koliaska which was standing before the entrance, and as soon as she had done so the footman shut her in, put up the steps again, and, catching hold of the strap behind the vehicle, shouted to the coachman, “Right away!” The reason of all this was that the lady was the possessor of a piece of intelligence that she was burning to communicate to a fellow-creature. Every moment she kept looking out of the carriage window, and perceiving, with almost speechless vexation, that, as yet, she was but half-way on her journey. The fronts of the houses appeared to her longer than usual, and in particular did the front of the white stone hospital, with its rows of narrow windows, seem interminable to a degree which at length forced her to ejaculate: “Oh, the cursed building! Positively there is no end to it!” Also, she twice adjured the coachman with the words, “Go quicker, Andrusha! You are a horribly long time over the journey this morning.” But at length the goal was reached, and the koliaska stopped before a one-storied wooden mansion, dark grey in colour, and having white carvings over the windows, a tall wooden fence and narrow garden in front of the latter, and a few meagre trees looming white with an incongruous coating of road dust. In the windows of the building were also a few flower pots and a parrot that kept alternately dancing on the floor of its cage and hanging on to the ring of the same with its beak. Also, in the sunshine before the door two pet dogs were sleeping. Here there lived the lady’s bosom friend. As soon as the bosom friend in question learnt of the newcomer’s arrival, she ran down into the hall, and the two ladies kissed and embraced one another. Then they adjourned to the drawing-room. “How glad I am to see you!” said the bosom friend. “When I heard some one arriving I wondered who could possibly be calling so early. Parasha declared that it must be the Vice-Governor’s wife, so, as I did not want to be bored with her, I gave orders that I was to be reported ‘not at home.’”","In the morning, even earlier than the hour fixed for visits in the town of N., there came fluttering out the doors of an orange wooden house with a mezzanine and light blue columns a lady in a stylish checked cloak, accompanied by a lackey in a greatcoat with several collars and gold braid on his round, glossy hat. The lady, with extraordinary haste, fluttered straight up the folding steps into the carriage standing at the front door. The lackey straightaway slammed the door on the lady, flung up the steps behind her, and, catching hold of the straps at the back of the carriage, shouted “Drive!” to the coachman. The lady was bearing some just-heard news and felt an irresistible urge to communicate it quickly. Every other moment she peeked out the window and saw to her unspeakable vexation that there was still halfway to go. Every house seemed longer than usual to her; the white stone almshouse with its narrow windows dragged on unbearably, so that she finally could not bear it and said: “Cursed building, there’s just no end to it!” The coachman had already twice been given the order: “Faster, faster, Andryushka! You’re taking insufferably long today!” At last the goal was attained. The carriage stopped in front of another one-storied wooden house, of a dark gray color, with little white bas-reliefs over the windows, and just in front of the windows a high wooden lattice and a narrow front garden, the slim trees of which were all white behind the lattice from the ever-abiding dust of the town. In the windows flashed flowerpots, a parrot swinging in his cage, clutching the ring with his beak, and two little dogs asleep in the sun. In this house lived the bosom friend of the arriving lady. The author is in the greatest perplexity how to name the two ladies in such a way that people do not get angry with him again, as they used to in olden times. To refer to them by fictitious names is dangerous. Whatever name one comes up with, there is sure to be found in some corner of our state, given its greatness, someone who bears that name and who is sure to get mortally angry and start saying that the author came secretly with the purpose of ferreting out everything about who he was, what kind of woolly coat he went around in, and what Agrafena Ivanovna he came calling on, and upon what food he liked to dine. To refer to them by their ranks, God forbid, is even more dangerous. Our ranks and estates are so irritated these days that they take personally whatever appears in printed books: such, evidently, is the mood in the air. It is enough simply to say that there is a stupid man in a certain town, and it already becomes personal; suddenly a gentleman of respectable appearance pops up and shouts: “ But I, too, am a man, which means that I, too, am stupid”—in short, he instantly grasps the situation. And therefore, to avoid all this, we shall refer to the lady who received the visit as she was referred to almost unanimously in the town of N.—namely, as a lady agreeable in all respects. She acquired this appellation legitimately, for she indeed spared nothing in making herself amiable to the utmost degree, but oh, of course, what nimble alacrity of female character lurked behind this amiableness! and oh, what a pin sometimes pricked through every agreeable word of hers! and God alone knew what seethed in that heart against any woman who might somewhere, somehow creep to the forefront. But all this was clothed in the subtlest worldliness, such as exists only in a provincial capital. Every movement she produced was tasteful, she even loved poetry, she even knew how to hold her head in a dreamy way on occasion—and everyone concurred that she was indeed a lady agreeable in all respects. Now the other lady, that is, the arriving one, was not possessed of so versatile a character, and therefore we shall refer to her as the simply agreeable lady. The arrival of the visitor woke the little dogs that were sleeping in the sun: the shaggy Adèle, ceaselessly entangled in her own fur, and Potpourri on his skinny legs. The one and the other, barking, carried the rings of their tails to the front hall, where the visitor was being freed from her cloak and emerged in a dress of fashionable pattern and color and with long tails around the neck; jasmine wafted through the whole room. The moment the lady agreeable in all respects learned of the arrival of the simply agreeable lady, she rushed to the front hall. The ladies seized each other’s hands, kissed each other, and uttered little cries, as boarding-school girls do when they meet soon after graduation, before their mamas have had time to explain to them that one has a father who is poorer and of lower rank than the other. The kiss was performed noisily, so that the dogs started barking again, for which they received a flick of a shawl, and the two ladies went to the drawing room, a light blue one, naturally, with a sofa, an oval table, and even a little screen covered with ivy; after them, growling, ran shaggy Adèle and tall Potpourri on his skinny legs. “Here, here, in this little corner!” the hostess said as she sat her visitor down in a corner of the sofa. “That’s right! that’s right! here’s a pillow for you!” So saying, she stuffed a pillow behind her back, on which a knight was embroidered in worsted the way things are always embroidered on canvas: the nose came out as a ladder, and the lips as a rectangle. “I’m so glad it’s you … I heard someone drive up and asked myself who it could be so early. Parasha said, ‘The vice-governor’s wife,’ and I said, ‘So that fool is coming to bore me again,’ and I was just about to say I wasn’t home …”","In the morning, even before the time which in the town of N-is set aside for paying calls, out of the doors of a wooden house painted orange, with a mezzanine and blue pillars, fluttered a lady in an elegant checkered cloak, escorted by a footman in a greatcoat with a cascade of collars and with a gold galloon on his round, sleek hat. The lady instantly, with inordinate haste, fluttered up the let-down steps into a barouche standing near the entrance. The footman at once slammed the carriage door shut after his mistress, folded up the steps, and grabbing hold of the straps behind the barouche, shouted to the coachman: “Let ’er go!” The lady was the bearer of a bit of news she had just heard and felt an insuperable urge to impart it to somebody as quickly as possible. She looked out of the carriage window every minute and saw, to her unutterable vexation, that half her journey lay still ahead of her. Each house front seemed to her wider than usual; the white stone poorhouse with its narrow small windows stretched out for an insufferably long time, so that she could not restrain herself from saying at last: “What a confounded building—there’s never an end to it!” The coachman had already received his commands twice: “Faster, faster, Andriushka! You’re driving unbearably slowly today!” Finally the goal was reached. The barouche came to a stop before a house that was also of wood, one-storied, of a dark-gray hue, with small white bas-reliefs above the windows and a high wooden trellis right in front of them, and a cramped little garden in front, behind the palisade of which the puny little trees had turned white from the town dust that never forsook them. Through the windows one could glimpse flowerpots, a parrot swaying in its cage, hanging onto a ring with its beak, and two lapdogs snoozing in the sun. In this house lived the closest and truest feminine friend of the lady who had just arrived. The author is very hard put to name both ladies in such a way as not to make them angry at him, as they used to be angry in the old days. To give them fictitious names is fraught with danger. No matter what name you think up, there will inevitably be found in some corner or other of our realm, since it is so large, someone who bears it and who will inevitably become incensed to the extent of wishing to beat me not only within an inch of my life but actually to death, who will begin saying that the author had purposely made a secret trip to the town to find out everything about him, just what sort of creature he is, and what sort of wretched little sheepskin jacket he walks around in, and which Agrafena Ivanovna he calls on, and what dishes he is fond of. But if one were to mention ranks—God save us, that would be still more dangerous! Nowadays all our ranks and classes are in so touchy a mood that anything and everything which may be between the covers of a printed book already has the appearance of personalities for them—such, evidently, is the spirit in the air. It suffices merely to say that there’s a stupid man in a certain town, and that’s already a personal reflection : a gentleman of respectable appearance will suddenly pounce upon you and set up a shout: “Why, I, too, am a man, ergo, I, too, am stupid!”—in a word, he’ll surmise in the wink of an eye just what you’re up to. And therefore, to avoid all this, let’s call the lady whom the guest had come to see what she was almost unanimously called in the town of N-: a lady agreeable in all respects. This appellation she had acquired quite legitimately, since she truly hadn’t spared any pains to make herself amiable to the utmost degree, even though, of course, there could be glimpsed through her amiability an— ooh, ever so brisk!—liveliness of a feminine nature; and even though, on occasion, pins and needles—ooh, ever so piercing!—would be poking up through some pleasant word of hers. And may God avert that which seethed within her heart against her who had in some way and through some means wormed her way through into the front ranks. But all this was clothed in the most refined social grace, such as is to be found only in a provincial capital. She performed every move with taste, was even fond of verse, even knew how to keep her head in a dreamy pose at times, and everybody concurred that she was, really, a lady who was agreeable in all respects. As for the other lady—that is, the one who had just arrived—her character did not have so many aspects, and for that reason we’ll call her a lady who was simply agreeable. The arrival of the guest had awakened the lapdogs snoozing in the sun: the shaggy Adele, who was forever tangling up in her long wool, and the darling little hound Potpourri, who had such slender little legs. Both the one and the other, barking, their tails curled into rings, dashed into the foyer, where the guest was divesting herself of her cloak, revealing at last a dress of fashionable color and design, with long streamers at the neck; jasmine was wafted all over the room. Barely had the lady who was agreeable in all respects learned of the arrival of the lady who was simply agreeable when she had already run out into the foyer. The ladies seized each other’s hands, kissed, and screamed, as boarding-school misses scream at a reunion shortly after graduation, before their mammas have yet had a chance to explain to them that the father of one of them is poorer and of lower rank than the father of the other. The kiss was consummated sonorously, since the lapdogs had begun barking anew, for which they were flicked with a handkerchief, and the two ladies went into the drawing room—light-blue, naturally, with a divan, an oval table, and even small screens, with ivy twining over them; after them ran, growling, the shaggy Adele and tall Potpourri on his slender little legs. “Here, here, in this little nook,” the hostess was saying, seating her guest in a corner of the divan. “There, that’s it! There, that’s it! There’s a cushion for you, too!” Having said which she thrust a cushion behind her guest’s back, which cushion had a knight embroidered in wool upon it, in that invariable fashion in which all knights are embroidered on canvas: the nose had come out as a ladder and the lips as a quadrangle. “But how happy I am that it’s you! ... I hear somebody driving up, and I think to myself, who could it be, as early as this? Parasha says: ‘It’s the Vice-Governor’s lady,’ and I say: ‘There, that fool has come to bore me again!’ and was on the verge of saying that I was not at home—”"

"— Нет, брат, ты не ругай меня фетюком, — отвечал зять, — я ей жизнью обязан. Такая, право, добрая, милая, такие ласки оказывает… до слез разбирает; спросит, что видел на ярмарке нужно все рассказать, такая, право, милая.","“No, brother, don’t scold me with a fetuk,” answered the son-in-law, “I owe her my life.” Such, really, kind, dear, she renders such caresses ... she disassembles to tears; he asks what he saw at the fair, you need to tell everything, so, really, dear.","“No, my boy, don’t call me names,” answered his brother-in-law, “I am indebted to her, to my wife. She is so kind and good really, she is so sweet to me, she touches me to tears. She will ask me what I saw at the fair, I must tell her all about it... she is so sweet really.”","“Do not insult me with the term Thetuk,” retorted the brother-in-law. “To her I owe my life, and she is a dear, good woman, and has shown me much affection. At the very thought of it I could weep. You see, she will be asking me what I have seen at the fair, and tell her about it I must, for she is such a dear, good woman.”","“No, brother, don’t call me a foozle,” the in-law replied. “I owe her my life. She’s so kind, really, so sweet, she shows me such tenderness … it moves me to tears; she’ll ask what I saw at the fair, I must tell her everything, really, she’s so sweet.”","“No, brother, don’t you go cursing me for a horse’s tail,” protested his brother-in-law. “I owe her my life. Really, now, she’s such a kind soul , so darling; she’s so loving to me ... it moves me to tears. She’ll ask me what I saw at the fair—I’ll have to tell her everything____Really, now, she’s such a darling.”"

"— Нет! полно! — сказал он наконец, — другую, другую жизнь. Пора в самом деле сделаться порядочным. О, если бы мне как-нибудь только выпутаться и уехать хоть с небольшим капиталом, поселюсь вдали от… А купчие?.. — Он подумал: «Что ж? зачем оставить это дело, стольким трудом приобретенное?.. Больше не стану покупать, но заложить те нужно. Ведь приобретенье это стоило трудов! Это я заложу, заложу, с тем чтобы купить па деньги поместье. Сделаюсь помещиком, потому что тут можно сделать много хорошего». И в мыслях его пробудились те чувства, которые овладели им, когда он был у Костанжогло, и милая, при греющем свете вечернем, умная беседа хозяина о том, как плодотворно и полезно занятье поместьем. Деревня так вдруг представилась ему прекрасно, точно как бы он в силах был почувствовать все перелести деревни.","- Not! full! he said at last, ""a different, different life."" It's time to really get honest. Oh, if only I could somehow get out and leave with at least a small capital, I would settle far from ... And what about the merchants? .. - He thought: “Well? why leave this business, acquired with so much work? .. I won’t buy anymore, but I need to mortgage them. After all, the acquisition was worth the trouble! I will mortgage this, I will mortgage it, in order to buy an estate with money. I will become a landowner, because here you can do a lot of good things. And his thoughts awakened those feelings that had taken possession of him when he was at Costanjoglo's, and the sweet, in the warming light of the evening, intelligent conversation of the owner about how fruitful and useful it is to occupy the estate. The village so suddenly presented itself beautifully to him, as if he were able to feel all the climbs of the village.","“Yes, it is enough!” he said at last, “a different life, a different life! It is high time indeed to become a decent man. Oh, if only I can somehow get out of this and go off with only a little capital, I will settle far away.... If I can but get back my papers ... and the deeds of purchase ...” he mused a little: “well? why abandon that which I have gained with such labour? I won’t buy any more but I must mortgage those. Getting them cost me such labour! I shall mortgage them so as to buy an estate with the money. I shall become a landowner, because one can do a great deal of good in that position.” And the feelings which had taken possession of him when he was at Skudronzhoglo’s rose up in his heart again, and he recalled the latter’s charming clever talk about the fruitfulness and usefulness of work on the land as he sat in the warm evening light. The country suddenly seemed to him delightful, as though he had been able at the moment to feel all its charms.","The old man sighed. “Paul Ivanovitch,” he said, “I know that you possess will-power, and that you possess also perseverance. A medicine may be bitter, yet the patient will gladly take it when assured that only by its means can he recover. Therefore, if it really be that you have no genuine love for doing good, do good by FORCING yourself to do so. Thus you will benefit yourself even more than you will benefit him for whose sake the act is performed. Only force yourself to do good just once and again, and, behold, you will suddenly conceive the TRUE love for well-doing. That is so, believe me. ‘A kingdom is to be won only by striving,’ says the proverb. That is to say, things are to be attained only by putting forth one’s whole strength, since nothing short of one’s whole strength will bring one to the desired goal. Paul Ivanovitch, within you there is a source of strength denied to many another man. I refer to the strength of an iron perseverance. Cannot THAT help you to overcome? Most men are weak and lack will-power, whereas I believe that you possess the power to act a hero’s part.” Sinking deep into Chichikov’s heart, these words would seem to have aroused in it a faint stirring of ambition, so much so that, if it was not fortitude which shone in his eyes, at all events it was something virile, and of much the same nature. “Athanasi Vassilievitch,” he said firmly, “if you will but petition for my release, as well as for permission for me to leave here with a portion of my property, I swear to you on my word of honour that I will begin a new life, and buy a country estate, and become the head of a household, and save money, not for myself, but for others, and do good everywhere, and to the best of my ability, and forget alike myself and the feasting and debauchery of town life, and lead, instead, a plain, sober existence.” “In that resolve may God strengthen you!” cried the old man with unbounded joy. “And I, for my part, will do my utmost to procure your release.","“No, enough!” he said finally, “a different, different life. It’s really time to become a decent man. Oh, if only I could somehow extricate myself and still be left with at least a little capital, I’d settle far away from … And the deeds?…” He thought: “What, then? why abandon this business, acquired with such labor? … I won’t buy any more, but I must mortgage those. The acquisition cost me labor! I’ll mortgage them, I will, in order to buy an estate. I’ll become a landowner, because here one can do much good.” And in his mind there awakened those feelings which had come over him when he was at Kostanzhoglo’s, listening to his host’s nice, intelligent conversation, in the warm evening light, about how fruitful and useful estate management is. The country suddenly appeared so beautiful to him, as if he were able to feel all the charms of country life.",
"— Нет, Павел Иванович, нет, вы гость, — говорил Манилов, показывая ему рукою на дверь.","“No, Pavel Ivanovich, no, you are a guest,” said Manilov, pointing to the door with his hand.","“No, Pavel Ivanovitch, no , you are the visitor,” said Manilov, motioning him to the door with his hand.","“I will follow YOU.” “No, Paul Ivanovitch—no! You are my guest.” And Manilov pointed towards the doorway.","“No, Pavel Ivanovich, no, you are a guest,” Manilov said, motioning him to the door with his hand.","“I shall follow you in.” “No, Pavel Ivanovich, no—you are my guest,” Manilov was saying, indicating the door with a wave of his hand."

"— Напротив, всё в наилучшем порядке, и брат мой отличнейший хозяин.","“On the contrary, everything is in the best order, and my brother is an excellent host.","“No, on the contrary, everything is in the best of order and my brother is an excellent manager.”","“On the contrary, everything is in splendid order, for my brother is the best of managers.” “Then to find things wearisome!” exclaimed Chichikov.","“On the contrary, everything’s in the best possible order, and my brother is an excellent manager.”",
"— Маловато, барин, — сказала старуха, однако ж взяла деньги с благодарностию и еще побежала впопыхах отворять им дверь. Она была не в убытке, потому что запросила вчетверо против того, что стоила водка.","“It’s not enough, master,” said the old woman, but she accepted the money with gratitude and ran in a hurry to open the door for them. She was not at a loss, because she asked for four times what the vodka cost.","“That’s very little, sir,” said the old woman. She took the money with gratitude, however, and ran with alacrity to open the door. She was not a loser by the transaction, for she had asked four times the cost of the vodka.","“No, it will NOT, barin,” protested the old woman. However, she took the money gratefully, and even ran to the door to open it for the gentlemen. As a matter of fact, she had lost nothing by the transaction, since she had demanded fully a quarter more than the vodka was worth.","“It’s a bit short, master,” said the old woman, though she took the money gratefully and hastened to run and open the door for them. She suffered no loss, since she had asked four times the price of the vodka.","“That’s not much, sir,” said the old woman; however, she accepted the silver coin with gratitude and even made a headlong dash to hold the door open for them. She was not really out anything, inasmuch as she had asked four times as much as the drinks were worth."
— Я бы недорого и взял. Для знакомства по рублику за штуку.,I would take it cheap. For dating for a ruble apiece.,"“I wouldn’t charge you much for them. For the sake of our good acquaintance, I will only ask a rouble a-piece.”","“I could let you have some cheap—say, as between friends, at a rouble a head?”","“I wouldn’t ask much. One little rouble apiece, for the sake of acquaintance.”","“Why, I wouldn’t take much, actually. For friendship’s sake, just a mere ruble a head.”"
"— Справедливо изволили заметить, ваше превосходительство. Но представьте же теперь мое положение… — Тут Чичиков, понизивши голос, стал говорить как бы по секрету: — У него в доме, ваше превосходительство, есть ключница, а у ключницы дети. Того и смотри, все перейдет им.","“You are right to remark, Your Excellency. But imagine now my situation…” Here Chichikov, lowering his voice, began to speak as if in secret: “He has a housekeeper, your Excellency, and the housekeeper has children. That and look, everything will pass to them.","“That is a very just observation, your Excellency. But imagine my position now.” Here Tchitchikov, dropping his voice, began saying as though it were a secret, “He has a housekeeper, your Excellency, and the housekeeper has children. If I don’t look out it will all go to them.”","“Possibly. And were that all, things would not be as bad as they are. But, unfortunately, my uncle has gone and taken up with his housekeeper, and has had children by her. Consequently, everything will now pass to THEM.”","“Quite a correct observation, if you please, Your Excellency. But imagine my position now …” Here Chichikov, lowering his voice, began speaking as if in secret: “He has a housekeeper in his house, Your Excellency, and she has children. Just you watch, everything will go to them.”",
"— Кого, батюшка?","- Who, father?","“Have whom, sir?”",“Hand over whom?”,"… Why not let me have them, Nastasya Petrovna?” “Whom, dearie?”","... Let me have them, now, Nastasia Petrovna!” “Whom, my dear sir?”"
— Не могу! — сказал Чичиков.,- I can not! Chichikov said.,"“I can‘t,” said Tchitchikov.","“Nevertheless I can eat no more,” said Chichikov.",“I can’t!” said Chichikov.,
"— Здравствуйте, батюшка. Каково почивали? — сказала хозяйка, приподнимаясь с места. Она была одета лучше, нежели вчера, — в темном платье и уже не в спальном чепце, но на шее все так же было что-то завязано.","— Hello, father. What was it like to rest? said the hostess, rising from her seat. She was better dressed than yesterday, in a dark dress and no longer in a sleeping cap, but there was still something tied around her neck.","“Good-morning, my good sir. How have you slept?” said the old lady, getting up from her seat. She was better dressed than she had been the night before, in a dark gown, and wore no nightcap, but she still had something wrapped round her neck.","“Good morning, dear sir,” she responded as she rose. “How have you slept?” She was dressed in better style than she had been on the previous evening. That is to say, she was now wearing a gown of some dark colour, and lacked her nightcap, and had swathed her neck in something stiff.","“Good morning, dearie. Did you sleep well?” said the mistress, rising from her place. She was better dressed than yesterday—in a dark dress, and not in a sleeping bonnet now, though there was still something wrapped around her neck.","“Greetings, my dear sir. How did you sleep?” inquired the hostess, rising a little from her seat. She was dressed somewhat better than yesterday, in a dark dress, and was now minus her sleeping cap; but there was still some sort of rag bound about her neck."
— Дворянство способно к злословью! — сказал Чичиков.,- The nobility is capable of slander! Chichikov said.,"I am sick of it at last.” “Country gentlemen are fond of backbiting,” said Tchitchikov.",“How readily folk speak evil!” exclaimed Chichikov.,“The gentry are quite capable of wicked talk!” said Chichikov.,
"— Не знаю,","- I do not know,",“I don’t know him.”,"And you, sir,” he added to Chichikov, “will you not join us at table?”",“I don’t.”,
"Манилов долго стоял на крыльце, провожая глазами удалявшуюся бричку, и когда она уже совершенно стала не видна, он все еще стоял, куря трубку. Наконец вошел он в комнату, сел на стуле и предался размышлению, душевно радуясь, что доставил гостю своему небольшое удовольствие. Потом мысли его перенеслись незаметно к другим предметам и наконец занеслись бог знает куда. Он думал о благополучии дружеской жизни, о том, как бы хорошо было жить с другом на берегу какой-нибудь реки, потом чрез эту реку начал строиться у него мост, потом огромнейший дом с таким высоким бельведером, что можно оттуда видеть даже Москву, и там пить вечером чай на открытом воздухе и рассуждать о каких-нибудь приятных предметах. Потом, что они вместе с Чичиковым приехали в какое-то общество в хороших каретах, где обворожают всех приятностию обращения, и что будто бы государь, узнавши о такой их дружбе, пожаловал их генералами, и далее, наконец, бог знает что такое, чего уже он и сам никак не мог разобрать. Странная просьба Чичикова прервала вдруг все его мечтания. Мысль о ней как-то особенно не варилась в его голове: как ни переворачивал он ее, но никак не мог изъяснить себе, и все время сидел он и курил трубку, что тянулось до самого ужина.","Manilov stood for a long time on the porch, following the retreating britzka with his eyes, and when it was no longer visible, he was still standing, smoking his pipe. At last he entered the room, sat down on a chair and gave himself over to reflection, sincerely glad that he had given his guest a little pleasure. Then his thoughts drifted imperceptibly to other objects, and finally drifted to God knows where. He thought about the well-being of a friendly life, about how nice it would be to live with a friend on the banks of some river, then a bridge began to be built across this river, then a huge house with such a high belvedere that you could even see Moscow from there, and there to drink tea in the evening in the open air and talk about some pleasant subjects. Then, that they, together with Chichikov, arrived in some kind of society in good carriages, where they enchant everyone with pleasant treatment, and that it was as if the sovereign, having learned about their friendship, granted them generals, and then, finally, God knows what is, what he himself could not make out. Chichikov's strange request suddenly interrupted all his dreams. The thought of her somehow did not particularly boil in his head: no matter how he turned it over, he could not explain it to himself, and all the time he sat and smoked his pipe, which lasted until dinner.","Manilov watched the chaise disappearing into the distance, and even after it was completely out of sight, still went on standing on the steps, smoking his pipe. At last he went into the house, sat down to the table and gave himself up to meditation, genuinely delighted at having given his visitor pleasure. Then his thoughts passed imperceptibly to other subjects, and goodness knows where they landed at last. He mused on the bliss of life spent in friendship, thought how nice it would be to live with a friend on some bank of a river, then a bridge began to rise across the river, then an immense house with such a high belvedereaa that one could see even Moscow from it, and then he dreamed of drinking tea there in the evenings in the open air and discussing agreeable subjects. Then he dreamed that he and Tchitchikov drove in fine carriages to some party, where they charmed every one by the agreeableness of their behaviour, and that the Tsar, hearing of their great friendship, made them both generals, and so passed into goodness knows what visions, such as he could not clearly make out himself. Tchitchikov’s strange request suddenly cut across all his dreams. It seemed as though his brain could not assimilate the idea, and however much he turned it about he could not explain it to himself, and so he sat on, smoking his pipe till supper-time.","For a long while Manilov stood following the departing britchka with his eyes. In fact, he continued to smoke his pipe and gaze after the vehicle even when it had become lost to view. Then he re-entered the drawing-room, seated himself upon a chair, and surrendered his mind to the thought that he had shown his guest most excellent entertainment. Next, his mind passed imperceptibly to other matters, until at last it lost itself God only knows where. He thought of the amenities of a life, of friendship, and of how nice it would be to live with a comrade on, say, the bank of some river, and to span the river with a bridge of his own, and to build an enormous mansion with a facade lofty enough even to afford a view to Moscow. On that facade he and his wife and friend would drink afternoon tea in the open air, and discuss interesting subjects; after which, in a fine carriage, they would drive to some reunion or other, where with their pleasant manners they would so charm the company that the Imperial Government, on learning of their merits, would raise the pair to the grade of General or God knows what—that is to say, to heights whereof even Manilov himself could form no idea. Then suddenly Chichikov’s extraordinary request interrupted the dreamer’s reflections, and he found his brain powerless to digest it, seeing that, turn and turn the matter about as he might, he could not properly explain its bearing. Smoking his pipe, he sat where he was until supper time.","Manilov stood for a long time on the porch, watching the departing britzka, and when it became quite invisible, he still stood there smoking his pipe. Finally he went inside, sat down on a chair, and gave himself over to reflection, rejoicing in his soul at having given his guest some small pleasure. Then his thoughts imperceptibly turned to other subjects and finally went off God knows where. He was thinking about the well-being of a life of friendship, about how nice it would be to live with a friend on the bank of some river, then a bridge began to be built across this river, then an enormous house with such a high belvedere that one could even see Moscow from it and drink tea there of an evening in the open air while discussing agreeable subjects. Then that he and Chichikov arrived together at some gathering in fine carriages, where they enchanted everyone with the agreeableness of their manners, and that the sovereign, supposedly learning there was such friendship between them, made them generals, and beyond that, finally, God knows what, something he himself could no longer figure out. Chichikov’s strange request suddenly interrupted all his reveries. The thought of it somehow especially refused to get digested in his head: whichever way he turned it, he simply could not explain it to himself, and all the while he sat and smoked his pipe, which went on right up to suppertime.","Manilov remained standing on the front staircase for a long time, his eyes following the receding carriage; even when it was altogether out of sight he still stood there, puffing away at his pipe. Finally he went indoors, sat down on a chair, and gave himself up to meditation, his soul rejoicing because he had afforded a slight gratification to his guest. After that his thoughts passed on imperceptibly to other matters and wound up God knows where. He was thinking of the felicity of a life of friendship, of how fine it would be to dwell with one’s friend on the bank of some river or other, after which his imagination began building a bridge across this river, then a most enormous house, with so lofty a cupola that one might see even Moscow from it, and he also thought how fine it would be to quaff tea there of evenings out in the open air and to discourse on pleasant subjects of one kind or another; after that he imagined that he and Chichikov had arrived in fine carriages at some social affair, where they were enchanting all and sundry with the affability of their behavior; next, the Sovereign, apparently having learned of so great a friendship as theirs, had elevated them to the rank of generals, and, after that, in the very end, his daydreams were of God knows what—things that he himself could make neither head nor tail of, no matter how hard he tried. Chichikov’s strange request put a sudden end to all his reveries. The thought of it refused , in some peculiar way, to be digested in his head; no matter how he turned it over and over in his mind, he could not make it clear to himself, as he sat there all this time and puffed away at his pipe, which occupation lasted until it was high time for supper."
"— Слышишь, Фетинья! — сказала хозяйка, обратясь к женщине, выходившей на крыльцо со свечою, которая успела уже притащить перину и, взбивши ее с обоих боков руками, напустила целый потоп перьев по всей комнате. — Ты возьми ихний-то кафтан вместе с исподним и прежде просуши их перед огнем, как делывали покойнику барину, а после перетри и выколоти хорошенько.","“Listen, Fetinya! said the hostess, turning to the woman, who was coming out onto the porch with a candle, who had already managed to drag the feather bed and, fluffing it up from both sides with her hands, sent a whole flood of feathers all over the room. - You take their caftan together with the underwear and first dry them in front of the fire, as they did to the deceased master, and then grind and beat them out well.","“Do you hear, Fetinya?” said the old lady, addressing the woman who had come out on to the steps with a light and who had now dragged in a feather bed and, beating it up on both sides, was scattering a perfect shower of feathers all over the room. “You take the gentleman’s coat together with his underthings, and first dry them before the fire as you used to do for the master, and afterwards give them a good brushing and beating.”","“Do you hear that, Fetinia?” said the hostess, turning to a woman who was engaged in dragging in a feather bed and deluging the room with feathers. “Take this coat and this vest, and, after drying them before the fire—just as we used to do for your late master—give them a good rub, and fold them up neatly.”","“Do you hear, Fetinya!” said the mistress, addressing the woman who had come out to the porch with a candle, and who had now managed to bring a feather bed and plump it up with her hands, loosing a flood of feathers all over the room. “Take his coat and underwear and dry them first in front of the fire, as you used to do for the late master, and then brush them and give them a good beating.”","“Do you hear that, Fetinia?” said the mistress of the house, turning to the woman who had first come out to the travelers and who by this time had already managed to drag in a feather bed and, having plumped it up with her hands on both sides, had loosed a whole deluge of feathers all over the room. “You take this gentleman’s greatcoat together with all his other garments and after first letting all of them dry out in front of a fire, as we used to do for the late master, you can then brush and beat them out well.”"
"— Мне совестно наложить на вас такую неприятную комиссию, потому что одно изъяснение с таким человеком для меня уже неприятная комиссия. Надобно вам сказать, что он из простых, мелкопоместных дворян нашей губернии, выслужился в Петербурге, вышел кое-как в люди, женившись там на чьей-то побочной дочери, и заважничал. Задает здесь тоны. Да у нас в губернии, слава богу, народ живет не глупый: мода нам не указ, а Петербург — не церковь.","“I am ashamed to impose such an unpleasant commission on you, because one explanation with such a person is already an unpleasant commission for me. I must tell you that he was one of the simple, small-scale nobles of our province, curried himself in St. Petersburg, somehow got into the people, marrying someone's natural daughter there, and put on airs. Sets the tone here. Yes, in our province, thank God, the people do not live stupid: fashion is not a decree for us, and Petersburg is not a church.","“I am ashamed really to impose such a disagreeable commission on you, for even an interview with such a man is to me an unpleasant commission. I must tell you that he comes of a simple family of small landowners of our province, has risen in the service in Petersburg, has managed to get into aristocratic society by marrying somebody’s illegitimate daughter and has begun to give himself airs. He behaves like a grand gentleman. In our province, thank God, people have some sense. Fashion is not the law for us, and Petersburg is not our holy place.”","“I should be ashamed to trouble you with such an unpleasant commission,” replied Vassili. “He is a man whom I take to be an utter rascal. Originally a member of a family of plain dvoriane in this province, he entered the Civil Service in St. Petersburg, then married some one’s natural daughter in that city, and has returned to lord it with a high hand. I cannot bear the tone he adopts. Our folk are by no means fools. They do not look upon the current fashion as the Tsar’s ukaz any more than they look upon St. Petersburg as the Church.”","“I’m ashamed to charge you with such an unpleasant mission, because merely to talk with such a man is already an unpleasant mission for me. I must tell you that he is from simple, petty-landowning nobility of our province, got his rank serving in Petersburg, set himself up somehow by marrying someone’s illegitimate daughter, and puts on airs. He sets the tone here. But, thank God, in our province people aren’t so stupid: for us fashion is no order, and Petersburg is no church.”",

"И действительно, Тентетников не шутя принялся хозяйничать и распоряжаться. Он увидел на месте, что приказчик был баба и дурак со всеми качествами дрянного приказчика, то есть вел аккуратно счет кур и яиц, пряжи и полотна, приносимых бабами, но не знал ни бельмеса в уборке хлеба и посевах, а в прибавленье ко всему подозревал мужиков в покушенье на жизнь свою. Дурака приказчика он выгнал, наместо его выбрал другого, бойкого. Оставил мелочи, обратил вниманье на главные части, уменьшил барщину, убавил дни работы на себя, прибавил времени мужикам работать на них самих и думал, что теперь дела пойдут наиотличнейшим порядком. Сам стал входить во все, показываться на полях, па гумне, в овинах, на мельницах, у пристани, при грузке и сплавке барок и плоскодонов.","And indeed, Tentetnikov, not jokingly, began to manage and dispose. He saw on the spot that the clerk was a woman and a fool with all the qualities of a lousy clerk, that is, he kept accurate count of chickens and eggs, yarn and linen brought by women, but did not know a single belmes in harvesting bread and crops, and suspected of adding to everything men in an attempt on their lives. He drove out the foolish clerk, instead of him he chose another, lively one. He left the little things, paid attention to the main parts, reduced the corvee, reduced the days of work for himself, added time for the peasants to work for themselves and thought that now things would go in the most excellent order. He himself began to enter into everything, to appear in the fields, on the threshing floor, in barns, at mills, at the pier, when loading and rafting barges and flat-bottomed boats.","And Tyentyetnikov really did set to work looking after his estate and his peasants in earnest. He saw at once that the steward really was an old woman and a fool with all the characteristics of a thoroughly bad steward— that is, he accurately kept an account of hens and eggs, of the yarn and the linen brought by the peasant women, but he knew absolutely nothing of harvest and sowing, and in addition suspected all the peasants of designs upon his life. He dismissed the foolish steward and engaged another, a smart fellow, in his place: without going into trivial matters he turned his attention to the points of most importance, diminished the dues, took off some of the days of labour for himself, giving the peasants more time to work on their own account, and thought that now things would go swimmingly. He went into everything himself and began to show himself in the fields, at the threshing floor, in the sheepfolds, at the mills and at the landing stage when barges and punts were being loaded and sent off.","So he applied himself to supervising and administering. He reduced the amount of the barstchina 40, he decreased the number of working-days for the owner, and he augmented the sum of the peasants’ leisure-time. He also dismissed the fool of a bailiff, and took to bearing a personal hand in everything—to being present in the fields, at the threshing-floor, at the kilns, at the wharf, at the freighting of barges and rafts, and at their conveyance down the river: wherefore","And in fact Tentetnikov began managing and giving orders in earnest. He saw on the spot that the steward was an old woman and a fool, with all the qualities of a rotten steward—that is, he kept a careful account of the hens and the eggs, of the yarn and linen the women brought, but did not know a blessed thing about harvesting and sowing, and on top of that suspected the peasants of making attempts on his life. He threw out the fool steward and chose another to replace him, a perky one. He disregarded trifles and paid attention to the main things, reduced the corvée, decreased the number of days the muzhiks had to work for him, added more time for them to work for themselves, and thought that things would now go most excellently. He began to enter into everything himself, to appear in the fields, on the threshing floor, in the barns, at the mills, on the wharf where barges and flatboats were loaded and sent off.",

"В образе преподавания наук он все переворотил вверх дном. С самыми благими намерениями завел он всякие нововведения — и все невпопад. Выписал новых преподавателей, с новыми взглядами и новыми точками воззрений. Читали они учено, забросали слушателей множеством новых терминов и слов. Видна была и логическая связь, и следованье за новыми открытиями, но увы! не было только, жизни в самой науке. Мертвечиной стало все это казаться в глазах уж начинавших понимать слушателей. Все пошло навыворот. Но хуже всего было то, что потерялось уваженье к начальству и власти: стали насмехаться и над наставниками и над преподавателями, директора стали называть Федькой, Булкой и другими разными именами; завелись такие дела, что нужно было многих выключить и выгнать.","In the manner of teaching the sciences, he turned everything upside down.

"«Да он, вишь ты, востроногий!» — стали говорить мужики и даже почесывать в затылках, потому что от долговременного бабьего управления они все изрядно поизленились. Но это продолжалось не долго. Русский мужик сметлив и умен: он понял скоро, что барин хоть и прыток и есть в нем охота взяться за многое, но как именно, каким образом взяться, — этого еще не смыслит, говорит как-то чересчур грамотно и затейливо, мужику невдолбеж и не в науку. Вышло то, что барин и мужик как-то не то чтобы совершенно не поняли друг друга, но просто не спелись вместе, не приспособились выводить одну и ту же ноту. Тентетников стал замечать, что на господской земле все выходило как-то хуже, чем на мужичьей: сеялось раньше, всходило позже. А работали, казалось, хорошо: он сам присутствовал и приказал выдать даже по чапорухе водки за усердные труды. У мужиков уже давно колосилась рожь, высыпался овес и кустилось просо, а у него едва начинал только идти хлеб в трубку, пятка колоса еще не завязывалась. Словом, стал замечать барин, что мужик просто плутует, несмотря на все льготы. Попробовал было укорить, но получил такой ответ: «Как можно, барин, чтобы мы о господской, то есть, выгоде не радели? Сами изволили видеть, как старались, когда пахали и сеяли: по чапорухе водки приказали подать». Что было на это возражать? «Да отчего ж теперь вышло скверно?» — допрашивал барин. «Кто его знает! Видно, червь подъел снизу, да и лето, вишь ты, какое: совсем дождей не было». Но барин видел, что у мужиков червь не подъедал снизу, да и дождь шел как-то странно, полосою: мужику угодил, а на барскую ниву хоть бы каплю выронил. Еще трудней ему было ладить с бабами. То и дело отпрашивались они от работ, жалуясь на тягость барщины. Странное дело! Он уничтожил вовсе всякие приносы холста, ягод, грибов и орехов, наполовину сбавил с них других работ, думая, что бабы обратят это время на домашнее хозяйство, обошьют, оденут своих мужей, умножат огороды. Не тут-то было! Праздность, драка, сплетни и всякие ссоры завелись между прекрасным полом такие, что мужья то и дело приходили к нему с такими словами: «Барин, уйми беса-бабу! Точно черт какой! житья нет от ней!» Несколько раз, скрепя свое сердце, хотел он приняться за строгость. Но как быть строгим? Баба приходила такой бабой, так развизгивалась, такая была хворая, больная, таких скверных, гадких наворачивала на себя тряпок — уж откуда она их набирала, бог ее весть. «Ступай, ступай себе только с глаз моих, бог с тобой!» — говорил бедный Тентетников и вослед за тем имел удовольствие видеть, как больная, вышед за ворота, схватывалась с соседкой за какую-нибудь репу и так отламывала ей бока, как не сумеет и здоровый мужик. Вздумал он было попробовать какую-то школу между ними завести, но от этого вышла такая чепуха, что он и голову повесил, — лучше было и не задумывать! Все это значительно охладило его рвенье и к хозяйству, и к разбирательному судейскому делу, и вообще к деятельности. При работах он уже присутствовал почти без вниманья: мысли были далеко, глаза отыскивали посторонние предметы. Во время покосов не глядел он на быстрое подыманье шестидесяти разом кос и мерное с легким шумом паденье под ними рядами высокой травы; он глядел вместо того на какой-нибудь в стороне извив реки, по берегам которой ходил красноносый, красноногий мартын — разумеется, птица, а не человек; он глядел, как этот мартын, поймав рыбу, держал ее впоперек в носу, как бы раздумывая, глотать или не глотать, и глядя в то же время пристально вздоль реки, где в отдаленье виден был другой мартын, еще не поймавший рыбы, но глядевший пристально на мартына, уже поймавшего рыбу. Во время уборки хлебов не глядел он на то, как складывали снопы копнами, крестами, а иногда и просто шишом. Ему не было дела до того, лениво или шибко метали стога и клали клади. Зажмуря глаза и приподняв голову кверху, к пространствам небесным, предоставлял он обонянью впивать запах полей, а слуху — поражаться голосами воздушного певучего населенья, когда оно отовсюду, от небес и от земли, соединяется в один звукосогласный хор, не переча друг другу. Бьет перепел, дергает в траве дергун, урчат и чиликают перелетающие коноплянки, по невидимой воздушной лестнице сыплются трели жаворонков, и турлыканье журавлей, несущихся в стороне вереницею, — точный звон серебряных труб, — слышится в пустоте звонко сотрясающейся пустыни воздушной. Вблизи ли производилась работа — он был вдали от нее; была ли она вдали — его глаза отыскивали, что было поближе. И был он похож на того рассеянного ученика, который глядит в книгу, но в то же время видит и фигу, подставленную ему товарищем. Наконец и совсем перестал он ходить на работы, бросил совершенно и суд, и всякие расправы, засел в комнаты и перестал принимать к себе даже с докладами приказчика.","“Yes, he, you see, sharp-legged!” - the peasants began to say and even scratch their heads, because from the long-term woman's management they all pretty much became emaciated. But this did not last long. The Russian muzhik is quick-witted and clever: he soon realized that the master, although he is quick and has a desire in him to take on a lot, but how exactly, how to take it on - he still does not understand this, he speaks somehow too competently and intricately, the peasant is not able to not into science. It turned out that the master and the peasant somehow did not understand each other at all, but simply did not sing together, did not adapt to deduce the same note. Tentetnikov began to notice that everything turned out somehow worse on the master's land than on the peasant's: it was sown earlier, it sprouted later. And they seemed to work well: he himself was present and ordered to give out even a cup of vodka for hard work. The muzhiks had long been earing rye, oats were spilling out and millet was bushing, but his bread had barely begun to go into the tube, the heel of the ear was not yet tied. In a word, the gentleman began to notice that the peasant was simply cheating, despite all the benefits. I tried to reproach, but received the following answer: “How is it possible, master, that we do not care about the master's, that is, the benefit? They themselves deigned to see how hard they tried when they plowed and sowed: they ordered vodka to be served at the chaporukha. What was the objection to this? “But why is it bad now?” the barin asked. ""Who knows! It can be seen that the worm has eaten up from below, and summer, you see, what it is: it didn’t rain at all. But the master saw that the worm did not eat up the bottom of the peasants, and the rain was somehow strange, in a strip: he pleased the peasant, but at least dropped a drop on the master's field. It was even more difficult for him to get along with the women. Every now and then they asked for time off from work, complaining about the burden of corvée. Strange affair! He completely destroyed all sorts of offerings of linen, berries, mushrooms and nuts, half reduced other work from them, thinking that the women would use this time for household chores, sew, clothe their husbands, multiply the gardens. It wasn't there! Idleness, fights, gossip and all sorts of quarrels started up between the fair sex, such that husbands now and then came to him with such words: “Master, calm down the demon woman! Exactly what the hell! there is no life from her!” Several times, reluctantly, he wanted to take up severity. But how to be strict? Baba came in like a woman, squealed so much, she was so ill, sick, she wrapped such nasty, nasty rags on herself - where did she get them from, God knows her. “Go, go only from my eyes, God be with you!” said poor Tentetnikov, and after that he had the pleasure of seeing how the sick woman, having gone out of the gate, grabbed some turnips with her neighbor and broke off her sides in such a way that even a healthy peasant would not be able to. He took it into his head to try to start some kind of school between them, but this turned out to be such nonsense that he hung his head - it was better not to even think about it! All this significantly cooled his zeal for the economy, and for the judicial case, and in general for activity. At work, he was already present almost without attention: his thoughts were far away, his eyes searched for foreign objects. During mowing, he did not look at the rapid lifting of sixty scythes at once and the measured, with a slight noise, falling under them in rows of tall grass; he looked instead at some meander of the river, along the banks of which a red-nosed, red-legged martyn walked - of course, a bird, and not a man; he watched how this martyn, having caught a fish, held it across his nose, as if considering whether to swallow or not to swallow, and at the same time gazing intently along the river, where in the distance another martyn was visible, who had not yet caught the fish, but was looking intently at martyn, who had already caught a fish. During the harvesting of bread, he did not look at how sheaves were stacked in shocks, crosses, and sometimes just a shish. He did not care whether lazily or quickly threw haystacks and laid luggage. Closing his eyes and raising his head upwards to the expanses of heaven, he allowed his sense of smell to drink in the smell of the fields, and his hearing to be amazed by the voices of the airy melodious population, when it from everywhere, from heaven and from earth, unites into one sound-consonant choir, without contradicting each other. The quail beats, the twitch twitches in the grass, the flying linnets rumble and chirp, the larks trill down the invisible air stairs, and the chirping of the cranes, rushing to the side in a line - the exact ringing of silver trumpets - is heard in the void of the resoundingly shaking air desert. Whether work was done near, he was away from it; whether she was far away - his eyes searched for what was closer. And he looked like that absent-minded student who looks at a book, but at the same time sees a fig, substituted for him by a comrade. Finally and completely he stopped going to work, he completely abandoned both the court and all reprisals, sat down in the rooms and stopped receiving even the reports of the clerk.","“My word, but he is a sharp one!” the peasants began to say, and they even scratched their heads a bit, for under the feeble control that had lasted so long they had all grown lazy. But this did not go on for very long. The Russian peasant is clever and shrewd: they soon realised that though the master was zealous and eager to undertake a great deal, he had no idea as yet how to set to work, that he talked somehow too learnedly and fancifully, beyond the grasp and understanding of the peasants. It came about that the master and the peasants, though they did not completely misunderstand each other, could not, so to speak, sing in unison, were incapable of producing the same note. Tyentyetnikov began to notice that everything somehow turned out worse on the master’s land than on the peasants‘. His fields were sown earlier and the crops came up later. Yet they seemed to be working well : he himself was present, and even ordered them to be given a mug of vodka for their diligent work. The peasants’ rye had already long been in ear, their oats were dropping, their millet was growing into a tuft, while his corn had scarcely begun to push up into a stem, the base of the ear had not yet formed. In fact he began to notice that the peasants were simply taking him in, in spite of all their flatteries; he tried reproaching them, but received some such answer, “How could we neglect the master’s profit, your honour? you saw yourself, sir, how we did our best when we were ploughing and sowing, you ordered us to be given a mug of vodka”; what reply could he make to that? “But why has it come up so badly?” he persisted. “Who can tell! It seems the worms have eaten it below! And look what a summer it has been, no rain at all.” But he saw that the worms had not eaten the peasants’ corn, and that the rain must have fallen queerly in streaks—it had favoured the peasants’ land, and not a drop had trickled on the master’s fields. He found it still more difficult to get on with the women. They were continually asking to be let off their work, complaining of the heavy burden of the labours they had to perform for him. It was strange! He had abolished all the dues of linen, fruit, mushrooms and nuts, and had taken off half of their other forced labour, expecting the women to employ their free time attending to their households, sewing and making clothes for their husbands and enlarging their kitchen gardens. But nothing of the sort happened. Such idleness, squabbling, scandal-mongering prevailed among the fair sex that their husbands were continually coming to him, saying: “Master, will you bring this fury of a woman to her senses, she is a regular devil, there is no living with her!” Sometimes, hardening his heart, he attempted to resort to severity. But how could he be severe? The woman came, so hopelessly womanish, made such a shrill outcry, was so sick and ailing, and had got herself up in such wretched filthy rags! (where she had picked them up, goodness only knows). “Go away, go where you like as long as it is out of my sight,” said poor Tyentyetnikov, and immediately afterwards had the satisfaction of seeing the woman at once, on going out of the gate, come to blows with a neighbour over a turnip and in spite of her ailing condition give her as sound a leathering as any sturdy peasant could have done. He had an idea of setting up a school among them, but this led to such a ridiculous fiasco that he hung his head and felt that it would have been better not to have thought of it. All this perceptibly cooled his zeal for looking after his estate as well as for the judicial and moral duties of his position, in fact for activity generally. He was present at the field labours almost without noticing them; his thoughts were far away, his eyes sought extraneous objects. During the mowing he did not watch the rapid rising and falling of the sixty scythes, and the regular fall of the high grass into long rows beneath them; he looked away at some bend in the river, on the bank of which some red-beaked, red-legged martin was walking—a bird of course, not a man; he watched how the martin having caught a fish held it crossways in his beak, hesitating whether to swallow it or not, and at the same time looked up the river where another martin could be seen who had not yet caught a fish, but was watching intently the martin who had. When the corn was being cut he did not watch how the sheaves were being laid in cocks or ricks or sometimes simply in a heap; he did not care whether they threw the sheaves up and made the cornstacks lazily or vigorously. Screwing up his eyes and gazing upwards at the vast expanse of the sky, he let his nostrils drink in the scent of the fields and his ears marvel at the voices of the numberless singers of the air when from all sides, from heaven and earth alike they unite in one chorus, without jarring on one another. The quail lashes its whip, the landrail utters its harsh grating cry among the grass, the linnets twitter and chirrup as they flit to and fro, the trills of the lark fall drop by drop down an unseen airy ladder, and the calls of the cranes, floating by in a long string, like the ringing notes of silver bugles, resound in the void of the melodiously vibrating ether. If the work were going on near by, he was far away; if it were far away, his eyes sought something near by. And he was like an inattentive schoolboy who looks into a book but sees his schoolfellow making a long nose at him. At last he gave up going out to look at the work altogether, abandoned his judicial duties, settled indoors and even left off seeing his steward and receiving reports from him.","He also dismissed the fool of a bailiff, and took to bearing a personal hand in everything—to being present in the fields, at the threshing-floor, at the kilns, at the wharf, at the freighting of barges and rafts, and at their conveyance down the river: wherefore even the lazy hands began to look to themselves. But this did not last long. The peasant is an observant individual, and Tientietnikov’s muzhiks soon scented the fact that, though energetic and desirous of doing much, the barin had no notion how to do it, nor even how to set about it—that, in short, he spoke by the book rather than out of his personal knowledge. Consequently things resulted, not in master and men failing to understand one another, but in their not singing together, in their not producing the very same note. That is to say, it was not long before Tientietnikov noticed that on the manorial lands, nothing prospered to the extent that it did on the peasants’. The manorial crops were sown in good time, and came up well, and every one appeared to work his best, so much so that Tientietnikov, who supervised the whole, frequently ordered mugs of vodka to be served out as a reward for the excellence of the labour performed. Yet the rye on the peasants’ land had formed into ear, and the oats had begun to shoot their grain, and the millet had filled before, on the manorial lands, the corn had so much as grown to stalk, or the ears had sprouted in embryo. In short, gradually the barin realised that, in spite of favours conferred, the peasants were playing the rogue with him. Next he resorted to remonstrance, but was met with the reply, “How could we not do our best for our barin? You yourself saw how well we laboured at the ploughing and the sowing, for you gave us mugs of vodka for our pains.” “Then why have things turned out so badly?” the barin persisted. “Who can say? It must be that a grub has eaten the crop from below. Besides, what a summer has it been—never a drop of rain!” Nevertheless, the barin noted that no grub had eaten the PEASANTS’ crops, as well as that the rain had fallen in the most curious fashion—namely, in patches. It had obliged the muzhiks, but had shed a mere sprinkling for the barin. Still more difficult did he find it to deal with the peasant women. Ever and anon they would beg to be excused from work, or start making complaints of the severity of the barstchina. Indeed, they were terrible folk! However, Tientietnikov abolished the majority of the tithes of linen, hedge fruit, mushrooms, and nuts, and also reduced by one-half other tasks proper to the women, in the hope that they would devote their spare time to their own domestic concerns—namely, to sewing and mending, and to making clothes for their husbands, and to increasing the area of their kitchen gardens. Yet no such result came about. On the contrary, such a pitch did the idleness, the quarrelsomeness, and the intriguing and caballing of the fair sex attain that their helpmeets were for ever coming to the barin with a request that he would rid one or another of his wife, since she had become a nuisance, and to live with her was impossible. Next, hardening his heart, the barin attempted severity. But of what avail was severity? The peasant woman remained always the peasant woman, and would come and whine that she was sick and ailing, and keep pitifully hugging to herself the mean and filthy rags which she had donned for the occasion. And when poor Tientietnikov found himself unable to say more to her than just, “Get out of my sight, and may the Lord go with you!” the next item in the comedy would be that he would see her, even as she was leaving his gates, fall to contending with a neighbour for, say, the possession of a turnip, and dealing out slaps in the face such as even a strong, healthy man could scarcely have compassed! Again, amongst other things, Tientietnikov conceived the idea of establishing a school for his people; but the scheme resulted in a farce which left him in sackcloth and ashes. In the same way he found that, when it came to a question of dispensing justice and of adjusting disputes, the host of juridical subtleties with which the professors had provided him proved absolutely useless. That is to say, the one party lied, and the other party lied, and only the devil could have decided between them. Consequently he himself perceived that a knowledge of mankind would have availed him more than all the legal refinements and philosophical maxims in the world could do. He lacked something; and though he could not divine what it was, the situation brought about was the common one of the barin failing to understand the peasant, and the peasant failing to understand the barin, and both becoming disaffected. In the end, these difficulties so chilled Tientietnikov’s enthusiasm that he took to supervising the labours of the field with greatly diminished attention. That is to say, no matter whether the scythes were softly swishing through the grass, or ricks were being built, or rafts were being loaded, he would allow his eyes to wander from his men, and to fall to gazing at, say, a red-billed, red-legged heron which, after strutting along the bank of a stream, would have caught a fish in its beak, and be holding it awhile, as though in doubt whether to swallow it. Next he would glance towards the spot where a similar bird, but one not yet in possession of a fish, was engaged in watching the doings of its mate. Lastly, with eyebrows knitted, and face turned to scan the zenith, he would drink in the smell of the fields, and fall to listening to the winged population of the air as from earth and sky alike the manifold music of winged creatures combined in a single harmonious chorus. In the rye the quail would be calling, and, in the grass, the corncrake, and over them would be wheeling flocks of twittering linnets. Also, the jacksnipe would be uttering its croak, and the lark executing its roulades where it had become lost in the sunshine, and cranes sending forth their trumpet-like challenge as they deployed towards the zenith in triangle-shaped flocks. In fact, the neighbourhood would seem to have become converted into one great concert of melody. O Creator, how fair is Thy world where, in remote, rural seclusion, it lies apart from cities and from highways! But soon even this began to pall upon Tientietnikov, and he ceased altogether to visit his fields, or to do aught but shut himself up in his rooms, where he refused to receive even the bailiff when that functionary called with his reports.","“He’s a quick-stepper, that he is!” the muzhiks started saying, and even scratched their heads, because from long-standing womanish management they had turned into a rather lazy lot. But this did not last long. The Russian muzhik is clever and intelligent: they soon understood that though the master was quick and wanted to take many things in hand, yet precisely how, in what way to take them in hand—of this he still knew nothing, he spoke somehow too literately and fancifully, puzzling for a muzhik and beyond his ability. As a result, while there was not really a total lack of comprehension between master and muzhik, they simply sang to different tunes, never able to produce the same note. Tentetnikov began to notice that everything turned out somehow worse on the master’s land than on the muzhik’s: the sowing came earlier, the sprouting later. Yet it seemed they worked well: he himself was there and even ordered a reward of a noggin of vodka for diligent work. The muzhiks had long had rye in the ear, oats swelling, millet bushing out, while his grain was still in the shoot and the ears had not yet begun to form. In short, the master began to notice that the muzhiks were simply cheating him, despite all his good turns. He made an attempt to reproach them, but received the following answer: “How can it be, your honor, that we haven’t been zealous for the master’s profit? You yourself were pleased to see how diligently we ploughed and sowed: you ordered us given a noggin of vodka each.” What objection could he make to that? “But why has it turned out so badly now?” the master persisted. “Who knows! Must be worms gnawed it from below, and just look at this summer: no rain at all.” But the master could see that worms had not gnawed the muzhiks’ crops from below, and it rained somehow oddly, in strips: the muzhiks got it, while the master’s fields did not get so much as a single drop. It was harder still for him to get along with the women. They asked so often to be excused from work, complaining about the heaviness of the corvée. How strange! He had abolished outright all bringing in of linen, berries, mushrooms, and nuts, and reduced the other tasks by half, thinking that the women would spend this time on housework, sewing, making clothes for their husbands, improving their kitchen gardens. Not a bit of it! Such idleness, fights, gossip, and all sorts of quarrels set in among the fair sex that the husbands kept coming to him with such words as: “Master, quiet down this demon of a woman! Just like some devil! she won’t let me live!” Several times, with heavy heart, he wanted to introduce severity. But how could he be severe? The woman would come as such a woman, get into such shrieking, was so sick, so ailing, would wrap herself up in such poor, vile rags—God only knows where she got them. “Go, just leave my sight, God be with you!” poor Tentetnikov would say, after which he would have the pleasure of seeing how the sick woman, coming out, would start squabbling with a neighbor over some turnip and give her such a drubbing as even a healthy man would not be capable of. He decided to try and start some sort of school among them, but such nonsense came out of it that he even hung his head—it would be better not to think about it! All this significantly chilled his enthusiasm both for management and for acting as judge, and generally for all activity. He was present at the field work almost without noticing it: his thoughts were far away, his eyes searched for extraneous objects. During the mowing he did not watch the quick raising of sixty scythes at once, followed by the measured fall, with a faint sound, of rows of tall grass; instead he looked off to the side at some bend of the river, on the bank of which walked some red-nosed, red-legged stalker—a stork, of course, not a man; he watched the stork catch a fish and hold it crosswise in its beak, as if considering whether to swallow it or not, and at the same time looking intently up the river, where, some distance away, another stork could be seen who had not yet caught a fish, but was looking intently at the one who already had. During the harvest, he did not look at how the sheaves were piled in shocks, in crosses, or sometimes simply in heaps. He hardly cared whether the piling and stacking was done lazily or briskly. Eyes closed, face lifted up to the spacious sky, he allowed his nose to imbibe the scent of the fields and his ears to be struck by the voices of the songful populace of the air, when it comes from everywhere, heaven and earth, to join in one harmonious chorus with no discord among themselves. The quail throbs, the corncrake crakes in the grass, linnets warble and twitter as they fly from place to place, the trilling of the lark spills down an invisible stairway of air, and the whooping of cranes rushing in a line off to one side—just like the sounding of silver trumpets—comes from the emptiness of the resoundingly vibrant airy desert. If the field work was close to him, he was far away from it; if it was far away, his eyes sought out things that were close. And he was like the distracted schoolboy who, while looking into his book, sees only the snook his comrade is cocking at him at the same time. In the end he stopped going out to the field work altogether, dropped entirely all administering of justice and punishments, firmly ensconced himself inside, and even stopped receiving the steward with his reports.",
"— Пропал совершенно сон! — сказал Чичиков, переворачиваясь на другую сторону, закутал голову в подушки и закрыл себя всего одеялом, чтобы не слышать ничего. Но сквозь одеяло слышалось беспрестанно: «Да поджарь, да подпеки, да дай взопреть хорошенько». Заснул он уже на каком-то индюке.","- Completely lost sleep! said Chichikov, turning over to the other side, wrapping his head in pillows and covering himself with a blanket so as not to hear anything. But through the blanket one could hear incessantly: ""Yes, fry, yes, bake, and let me squat well."" He fell asleep already on some turkey.","“I shall never get to sleep,” said Tchitchikov. Turning over on the other side, he buried his head in the pillow and pulled the quilt up over it, that he might hear nothing, but through the quilt he heard unceasingly: “And roast it well,” and “Bake it thoroughly.” He fell asleep over a turkey.","Yes, and put a lump of ice into the pig’s bladder, so as to swell it up.” Many other dishes did Pietukh order, and nothing was to be heard but his talk of boiling, roasting, and stewing. Finally, just as mention was being made of a turkey cock, Chichikov fell asleep.","“Sleep’s gone completely!” said Chichikov, turning on his other side, burying his head in the pillows, and covering himself up with a blanket so as not to hear anything. But through the blanket came unremittingly: “ And fry it, and bake it, and let it plump up nicely.” He finally fell asleep at some turkey.",

"— Бейте его! — кричал Ноздрев, порываясь вперед с черешневым чубуком, весь в жару, в поту, как будто подступал под неприступную крепость. — Бейте его! — кричал он таким же голосом, как во время великого приступа кричит своему взводу: «Ребята, вперед!» какой-нибудь отчаянный поручик, которого взбалмошная храбрость уже приобрела такую известность, что дается нарочный приказ держать его за руки во время горячих дел. Но поручик уже почувствовал бранный задор, все пошло кругом в голове его; перед ним носится Суворов, он лезет на великое дело. «Ребята, вперед!» — кричит он, порываясь, не помышляя, что вредит уже обдуманному плану общего приступа, что миллионы ружейных дул выставились в амбразуры неприступных, уходящих за облака крепостных стен, что взлетит, как пух, на воздух его бессильный взвод и что уже свищет роковая пуля, готовясь захлопнуть его крикливую глотку. Но если Ноздрев выразил собою подступившего под крепость отчаянного, потерявшегося поручика, то крепость, на которую он шел, никак не была похожа на неприступную. Напротив, крепость чувствовала такой страх, что душа ее спряталась в самые пятки. Уже стул, которым он вздумал было защищаться, был вырван крепостными людьми из рук его, уже, зажмурив глаза, ни жив ни мертв, он готовился отведать черкесского чубука своего хозяина, и бог знает чего бы ни случилось с ним; но судьбам угодно было спасти бока, плеча и все благовоспитанные части нашего героя. Неожиданным образом звякнули вдруг, как с облаков, задребезжавшие звуки колокольчика, раздался ясно стук колес подлетевшей к крыльцу телеги, и отозвались даже в самой комнате тяжелый храп и тяжкая одышка разгоряченных коней остановившейся тройки. Все невольно глянули в окно: кто-то, с усами, в полувоенном сюртуке, вылезал из телеги. Осведомившись в передней, вошел он в ту самую минуту, когда Чичиков не успел еще опомниться от своего страха и был в самом жалком положении, в каком когда-либо находился смертный.","- Beat him! shouted Nozdryov, rushing forward with a cherry chibouk, covered in heat and sweat, as if he were approaching an impregnable fortress. - Beat him! he shouted in the same voice as during a great attack he shouts to his platoon: “Guys, go ahead!” some desperate lieutenant, whose eccentric courage has already gained such fame that a special order is given to hold his hands during hot deeds. But the lieutenant already felt abusive enthusiasm, everything went round in his head; Suvorov rushes before him, he climbs to a great cause. ""Guys, go ahead!"" he shouts, rushing, not thinking that he is harming the already well-thought-out plan of the general attack, that millions of gun muzzles are exposed in the embrasures of impregnable fortress walls that go beyond the clouds, that his powerless platoon will fly up like fluff into the air, and that the fatal bullet is already whistling, preparing to slam his noisy throat. But if Nozdryov expressed himself as a desperate, lost lieutenant who approached the fortress, then the fortress he was going to did not at all look like an impregnable one. On the contrary, the fortress felt such fear that its soul hid in its very heels. Already the chair with which he had taken it into his head to defend himself had been torn from his hands by the serfs, already, closing his eyes, neither dead nor alive, he was preparing to taste his master's Circassian chubuk, and God knows what might happen to him; but the fates were pleased to save the sides, shoulders and all the well-bred parts of our hero. In an unexpected way, suddenly, as if from clouds, the sounds of a bell rattled, the sound of the wheels of a cart flying up to the porch was heard clearly, and even in the room itself the heavy snoring and heavy shortness of breath of the hot horses of the stopped troika echoed. Everyone involuntarily glanced out the window: someone with a mustache, in a semi-military frock coat, was getting out of the cart. Having inquired about the entrance, he entered at the very moment when Chichikov had not yet had time to recover from his fear and was in the most miserable position in which a mortal had ever been.","“Beat him!” cried Nozdryov, dashing forward with the cherrywood chibouk, as hot and perspiring as though he were attacking an impregnable citadel. “Beat him!” he shouted in the voice with which some desperate lieutenant shouts “Forward, lads!” to his men, though his hot-headed valour has attained such notoriety that special instructions have been given him to curb it when advancing to the attack. But the lieutenant is stirred by martial ardour, everything whirls round in his head, he has visions of Suvorovay and yearns for deeds of heroism. “Forward, lads!” he shouts, regardless of the fact that he is ruining the plan laid down for the general attack, that innumerable guns are ranged in the embrasure of the impregnable fortress walls that vanish into the skies, that his helpless company will be blown to atoms, and that already the fatal bullet that will still his shouts and close his mouth for ever is whistling through the air. But if Nozdryov did suggest a desperate and frantic lieutenant attacking a fortress, it must be admitted that the fortress that he was attacking was by no means an impregnable one. On the contrary, the object of his attack was so overwhelmed with terror that his heart sank into his heels. Already the chair with which he had thought to protect himself had been wrenched from his hands by the servants, already closing his eyes, more dead than alive, he was expecting to feel his host’s Circassianaz chibouk, and God only knows what might not have happened to him in another moment; but the fates were pleased to spare the sides, the shoulders, and all the well-bred person of our hero. Suddenly and unexpectedly, as though from the clouds, came the tinkle of jangling bells, there was a distinct sound of the rattling wheels of a trap flying up to the steps, and the heavy snorts and laboured breathing of the over-heated horses resounded even in the room. Every one involuntarily glanced out of window: a man with a moustache, in a semi-military uniform, got out of the trap. After inquiries in the hall, he walked in before Tchitchikov could recover from his terror and while he was in the most pitiful position in which mortal could be placed.","“Thrash him!” again shouted Nozdrev as he rushed forward in a state of heat and perspiration more proper to a warrior who is attacking an impregnable fortress. “Thrash him!” again he shouted in a voice like that of some half-demented lieutenant whose desperate bravery has acquired such a reputation that orders have had to be issued that his hands shall be held lest he attempt deeds of over-presumptuous daring. Seized with the military spirit, however, the lieutenant’s head begins to whirl, and before his eye there flits the image of Suvorov 21. He advances to the great encounter, and impulsively cries, “Forward, my sons!”—cries it without reflecting that he may be spoiling the plan of the general attack, that millions of rifles may be protruding their muzzles through the embrasures of the impregnable, towering walls of the fortress, that his own impotent assault may be destined to be dissipated like dust before the wind, and that already there may have been launched on its whistling career the bullet which is to close for ever his vociferous throat. However, if Nozdrev resembled the headstrong, desperate lieutenant whom we have just pictured as advancing upon a fortress, at least the fortress itself in no way resembled the impregnable stronghold which I have described. As a matter of fact, the fortress became seized with a panic which drove its spirit into its boots. First of all, the chair with which Chichikov (the fortress in question) sought to defend himself was wrested from his grasp by the serfs, and then—blinking and neither alive nor dead—he turned to parry the Circassian pipe-stem of his host. In fact, God only knows what would have happened had not the fates been pleased by a miracle to deliver Chichikov’s elegant back and shoulders from the onslaught. Suddenly, and as unexpectedly as though the sound had come from the clouds, there made itself heard the tinkling notes of a collar-bell, and then the rumble of wheels approaching the entrance steps, and, lastly, the snorting and hard breathing of a team of horses as a vehicle came to a standstill. Involuntarily all present glanced through the window, and saw a man clad in a semi-military greatcoat leap from a buggy. After making an inquiry or two in the hall, he entered the dining-room just at the juncture when Chichikov, almost swooning with terror, had found himself placed in about as awkward a situation as could well befall a mortal man.","“Beat him!” shouted Nozdryov, charging forward with his cherrywood chibouk, all hot and sweaty, as if he were assaulting an impregnable fortress. “Beat him!” he shouted in the same voice in which some desperate lieutenant, during a major assault, shouts “Forward, boys!” to his detachment, his extravagant valor already of such renown that a special order has been issued to hold him by the arms when things get hot. But the lieutenant has already caught the feeling of martial fervor, his head is all in a whirl; Suvorov17 hovers before his eyes, he pushes on towards a great deed. “Forward, boys!” he shouts, charging, not thinking of how he is damaging the already worked-out plan for the general assault, of the millions of gun barrels thrust through the embrasures of the fortress walls, impregnable, soaring beyond the clouds, of how his powerless detachment will be blown into the air like swansdown, or of the fatal bullet already whistling and about to slam shut his clamorous gullet. But if Nozdryov himself represented the desperate, lost, fortress-assaulting lieutenant, the fortress he was attacking in no way resembled an impregnable one. On the contrary, the fortress was so afraid that its heart sank right into its shoes. Already the chair with which he had thought to defend himself had been torn from his hands by the serfs, already, with eyes shut, more dead than alive, he was preparing to get a taste of his host’s Circassian chibouk, and God knows what was going to happen to him; but it pleased the fates to spare the ribs, the shoulders, and all the polite parts of our hero. Unexpectedly, there suddenly came a clinking, as if from the clouds, a jingling sound of bells, there was a rattle of wheels as a cart flew up to the porch, and even into the room itself came the heavy snorting and heavy breathing from the overheated horses of the stopped troika. Everyone involuntarily glanced at the window: someone, with a mustache, in a half-military frock coat, was getting out of the cart. After making inquiries in the front hall, he entered at the very moment when Chichikov, having not yet managed to collect himself after his fear, was in the most pitiful position a mortal had ever been in.","“Beat him up!” Nozdrev kept yelling, all ablaze and sweating, straining forward with his cherrywood chibouk, as though he were storming an impregnable fortress. “Beat him up!” He kept yelling in the same sort of voice that some desperate lieutenant, whose harebrained bravery has already gained such a reputation that a specific order is issued to hold him back by his arms during the heat of battle, uses to yell “Forward, lads!” to his platoon during a great assault. But the lieutenant has already felt the martial fervor, everything has begun going round and round in his head: Suvorov, that great general, soars in a vision before him; the lieutenant strains forward to perform a great deed. “Forward, lads!” he yells, dashing ahead, without reflecting that he is jeopardizing the plan of attack already decided upon, that countless gun muzzles are thrust out of the embrasures of the fortress, that his impotent platoon will be blown up into the air like so much swan’s-down, and that the bullet with his name on it is already whizzing through the air, just about to shut off his vociferous throat. But if Nozdrev was portraying in his person the lieutenant attacking the fortress, desperate and out of control, the fortress he was storming did not in any way resemble an impregnable one. On the contrary, the fortress was experiencing such fright that its heart was in its very heels. Already the chair, with which he had conceived the notion of defending himself, was wrested out of his hands by the serfs ; already, with his eyes shut tight, neither dead nor alive, he was preparing for a taste of his host s Circassian chibouk, and God knows what might have befallen him; but it pleased the Fates to save the sides, shoulders, and all the well-nurtured parts of our hero. In an unexpected fashion there suddenly came, as if from the clouds, the quivering sounds of jingle bells; there came clearly the rattle of cartwheels flying up to the front entrance, and the heavy snorting and labored breathing of the heated steeds of a halted troika echoed even in the very room. All involuntarily looked out of the window; some mustachioed fellow in a semi-military frock coat was clambering out of the cart. After inquiring in the entry, he entered at precisely the moment when Chichikov, not having yet had a chance to recover from his fright, was in just about the most piteous situation in which mortal man ever found himself."

"— Да у меня-то их хорошо пекут, — сказала хозяйка, — да вот беда: урожай плох, мука уж такая неважная… Да что же, батюшка, вы так спешите? — проговорила она, увидя, что Чичиков взял в руки картуз, — ведь и бричка еще не заложена.","“Yes, I bake them well,” said the hostess, “but the trouble is: the harvest is bad, the flour is so unimportant ...

But why are you in such a hurry?” she said, seeing that Tchitchikov was taking up his cap.","“Yes, we make them well here,” replied Madame. “Yet how unfortunate it is that the harvest should have proved so poor as to have prevented me from earning anything on my— But why should you be in such a hurry to depart, good sir?” She broke off on seeing Chichikov reach for his cap. “The britchka is not yet ready.”","“Yes, my cook makes them well,” said the mistress, “but the trouble is that the harvest was bad, and the flour turned out so uncommendable … But, my dear, why are you in such a rush?” she said, seeing that Chichikov had taken his peaked cap in his hand, “the britzka hasn’t been harnessed yet.”","“Yes, they make them well in my kitchen,” said the hostess, “but here’s the trouble: the crop was poor; the flour isn’t what it might have been. ... Why, my dear, why are you in such a hurry?” she asked, seeing that Chichikov had already picked up his hat. “Why, your carriage isn’t harnessed yet.”"
"— Да, мне пора! — произнес он, взявшись за шляпу.","— Yes, I have to go! he said, taking hold of his hat.","“Yes, I must be off,” he said, taking his hat.","“Yes, I must be going,” he said as he took his hat.","“Yes, it’s time!” he said, picking up his hat.","“Yes, it’s time for me to be going!” he announced, picking up his hat."

And indeed what fun is there sitting in a nurse’s arms and spoiling people’s coats!","“Never mind, never mind; it is nothing,” said Chichikov as he strove to communicate to his features as cheerful an expression as possible.","But it seems they were both lying: had they been offered such an exchange, they would straightaway have backed out of it. And what fun is it, indeed, sitting in a nurse’s arms and spoiling tailcoats!",

"Закуске последовал обед. Здесь добродушный хозяин сделался совершенным разбойником.

Here the good-natured host became a perfect robber.

God loves trinity"". The guest ate three - he told him: “Where is a cart with three wheels? Who builds a hut with three corners? For four he had a saying again, for five - too. Chichikov ate almost twelve slices of something and thought: ""Well, now the owner won't clean up anything else."" It was not there: the owner, without saying a word, put on his plate the back part of the calf roasted on a spit, the best part, whatever it was, with kidneys, and what a calf!","The savouries were followed by dinner. The good-hearted fat gentleman showed himself now a regular ruffian. As soon as he saw one piece on a visitor’s plate he would put a second piece beside it, saying: “It is not good for man or bird to live alone.” If the visitor finished the two pieces, he would foist a third on him, saying: “What’s the good of two, God loves a trinity.” If the guest devoured all three he would say: “Where’s the cart with three wheels? Who built a three-cornered hut?” For four he had another saying and for five, too. Tchitchikov ate nearly a dozen slices of something and thought: “Well, our host won’t force anything more upon me.” But he was wrong, without a word the master of the house laid upon his plate a piece of ribs of veal roasted on a spit, the best piece of all with the kidney, and what veal it was!","It was his nature to care for nothing mild. To the zakuski succeeded the meal itself, and the host became a perfect glutton on his guests’ behalf. Should he notice that a guest had taken but a single piece of a comestible, he added thereto another one, saying: “Without a mate, neither man nor bird can live in this world.” Should any one take two pieces, he added thereto a third, saying: “What is the good of the number 2? God loves a trinity.” Should any one take three pieces, he would say: “Where do you see a waggon with three wheels? Who builds a three-cornered hut?” Lastly, should any one take four pieces, he would cap them with a fifth, and add thereto the punning quip, “Na piat opiat 45”. After devouring at least twelve steaks of sturgeon, Chichikov ventured to think to himself, “My host cannot possibly add to THEM,” but found that he was mistaken, for, without a word, Pietukh heaped upon his plate an enormous portion of spit-roasted veal, and also some kidneys. And what veal it was!","The hors d’oeuvres were followed by dinner. Here the good-natured host turned into a real bully. The moment he noticed someone taking one piece, he would immediately give him a second, muttering: “Without a mate neither man nor bird can live in this world.” The guest ate the two—he heaped on a third, muttering: “What good is the number two? God loves the trinity.” The guest ate the third—then he: “Who ever saw a cart with three wheels? Does anyone build a cottage with three corners?” For four he had yet another saying, and also for five. Chichikov ate about a dozen helpings of something and thought: “Well, the host can’t come up with anything more now.” Not so: the host, without saying a word, put on his plate a rack of veal roasted on a spit, the best part there is, with the kidneys, and of such a calf!",
"Белокурый был один из тех людей, в характере которых на первый взгляд есть какое-то упорство. Еще не успеешь открыть рта, как они уже готовы спорить и, кажется, никогда не согласятся на то, что явно противуположно их образу мыслей, что никогда не назовут глупого умным и что в особенности не согласятся плясать по чужой дудке; а кончится всегда тем, что в характере их окажется мягкость, что они согласятся именно на то, что отвергали, глупое назовут умным и пойдут потом поплясывать как нельзя лучше под чужую дудку, — словом, начнут гладью, а кончат гадью.","The blond was one of those people whose character at first glance has some kind of stubbornness. Before you open your mouth, they are already ready to argue and, it seems, will never agree to something that is clearly contrary to their way of thinking, that they will never call a stupid person intelligent, and that they will especially not agree to dance according to someone else's tune; but it will always end with softness in their character, that they will agree precisely to what they rejected, they will call the stupid smart and then go to dance as well as possible to someone else's tune - in a word, they will start smooth, and end with shit.","The fair man was one of those people in whose character a certain obstinacy is at first sight apparent. Before you have time to open your lips, they are ready to begin arguing and it seems as though they will never agree to what is openly opposed to their way of thinking, that they will never call what is foolish sensible, and above all will never dance to another man’s piping. But it always ends in their displaying a weakness of will, in their agreeing to what they have denied, calling what is foolish sensible and dancing in fine style to another man’s piping—in fact they begin well and end badly.","The flaxen-haired man was one of those people in whose character, at first sight, there seems to lurk a certain grain of stubbornness—so much so that, almost before one has begun to speak, they are ready to dispute one’s words, and to disagree with anything that may be opposed to their peculiar form of opinion. For instance, they will decline to have folly called wisdom, or any tune danced to but their own. Always, however, will there become manifest in their character a soft spot, and in the end they will accept what hitherto they have denied, and call what is foolish sensible, and even dance—yes, better than any one else will do—to a tune set by some one else. In short, they generally begin well, but always end badly.","The fair-haired man was one of those people in whose character there is at first sight a certain obstinacy. Before you can open your mouth, they are already prepared to argue and, it seems, will never agree to anything that is clearly contrary to their way of thinking, will never call a stupid thing smart, and in particular will never agree to dance to another man’s tune; but it always ends up that there is a certain softness in their character, that they will agree precisely to what they had rejected, will call a stupid thing smart, and will then go off dancing their best to another man’s tune—in short, starts out well, ends in hell.","The flaxen-fair fellow was one of those people in the character of whom there is, at first glance, a certain streak of stubbornness. You hardly have time to open your mouth when they’re already set to argue, and, it seems, under no circumstances will they ever consent to that which is obviously contrary to their way of thinking, or consent to call that sensible which is stupid, and, in particular, never will they consent to dance to another’s tune; and yet it will always wind up by a certain soft spot in their makeup coming to the fore, by their consenting to precisely that which they had been rejecting; that which is stupid they will call sensible, and will thereafter set off to dancing to another’s tune in a way that could not be bettered—in short, they’ll start off smoothly and end up uncouthly."
— Если только ваше превосходительство…,“Unless Your Excellency…”,"“If only, your Excellency ...”","Chichikov bowed so low and so long that, by the time that his eyes had ceased to see nothing but his own boots, the General’s daughter had disappeared, and in her place was standing a bewhiskered butler, armed with a silver soap-dish and a hand-basin.",“If Your Excellency …”,
"— Да что! — сказал Хлобуев. — Право, мне кажется, мы совсем не для благоразумия рождены. Я не верю, чтобы из нас был кто-нибудь благоразумным. Если я вижу, что иной даже и порядочно живет, собирает и копит деньгу, — не верю я и тому! На старости и его черт попутает — спустит потом всё вдруг! И все у нас так: и благородные, и мужики, и просвещенные, и непросвещенные. Вон какой был умный мужик: из ничего нажил сто тысяч, а как нажил сто тысяч, пришла в голову дурь сделать ванну из шампанского, и выкупался в шампанском. Но вот мы, кажется, и все обсмотрели. Больше ничего нет. Хотите разве взглянуть на мельницу? Впрочем, в ней нет колеса, да и строенье никуда не годится.","— What! Khlobuev said. “Really, it seems to me that we were not born for prudence at all. I don't believe that any of us are sensible. If I see that someone even lives decently, collects and saves money, I don’t believe even that! In old age, the devil will confuse him - then he will suddenly lower everything! And all of us are like this: both noble and muzhiks, both enlightened and unenlightened. Look what a smart man he was: he made a hundred thousand out of nothing, and how he made a hundred thousand, the foolish idea came to make a bath of champagne, and bathed in champagne. But here we seem to have looked at everything. There is nothing more. Would you like to see the mill? However, there is no wheel in it, and the structure is no good.","“Well!” said Hlobuev. “Really it seems to me that we are not created for common sense. I don’t believe any one of us is sensible. If I do see that some one is actually living respectably and making and saving money I don’t trust even him: the devil will confound him in his old age, he will suddenly let it all go! And every one is like that among us, the gentry and the peasants, the cultured and the uncultured. There was a clever peasant who, starting from nothing, made a hundred thousand, and when he had made a hundred thousand he took a silly craze into his head to have a bath of champagne, and he did bathe in champagne. But now I believe we have looked over everything. There is nothing more. I don’t know whether you would like to look at the mill. It has no wheel, though, and its works are good for nothing.”","“‘Tis everywhere the same story.” “To tell the truth, we are not born to common sense. I doubt whether Russia has ever produced a really sensible man. For my own part, if I see my neighbour living a regular life, and making money, and saving it, I begin to distrust him, and to feel certain that in old age, if not before, he too will be led astray by the devil—led astray in a moment. Yes, whether or not we be educated, there is something we lack.","“Come, now!” said Khlobuev. “Really, it seems to me that we’re not born for reasonableness at all. I don’t believe any of us is reasonable. If I see that someone is even living decently, collecting money and putting it aside—I still don’t believe it. When he’s old, the devil will have his way with him—he’ll blow it all at once! We’re all the same: noblemen and muzhiks, educated and uneducated. There was one clever muzhik: made a hundred thousand out of nothing, and, once he’d made the hundred thousand, he got the crazy idea of taking a bath in champagne, so he took a bath in champagne. But I think we’ve looked it all over. There isn’t any more. Unless you want to glance at the mill? It has no wheel, however, and the building is good for nothing.”",

"Это очень его заинтересовало. В анониме было так много заманчивого и подстрекающего любопытство, что он перечел и в другой и в третий раз письмо и наконец сказал: «Любопытно бы, однако ж, знать, кто бы такая была писавшая!» Словом, дело, как видно, сделалось сурьезно; более часу он все думал об этом, наконец, расставив руки и наклоня голову, сказал: «А письмо очень, очень кудряво написано!» Потом, само собой разумеется, письмо было свернуто и уложено в шкатулку, в соседстве с какою-то афишею и пригласительным свадебным билетом, семь лет сохранявшимся в том же положении и на том же месте. Немного спустя принесли к нему, точно, приглашенье на бал к губернатору, — дело весьма обыкновенное в губернских городах: где губернатор, там и бал, иначе никак не будет надлежащей любви и уважения со стороны дворянства.","This interested him very much. There was so much tempting and inciting curiosity in the anonymous person that he re-read the letter a second and a third time and finally said: “It would be interesting, however, to know who the writer was!” In a word, the matter, apparently, became serious; for more than an hour he kept thinking about it, and finally, spreading his arms and bowing his head, he said: “And the letter is very, very curly written!” Then, of course, the letter was folded up and placed in a box, next to some kind of poster and a wedding invitation card, which had been preserved for seven years in the same position and in the same place. A little later, they brought him, as it were, an invitation to a ball to the governor - a very common thing in provincial cities: where the governor is, there is a ball, otherwise there will be no proper love and respect from the nobility.","This greatly interested him. There was so much that was alluring and that excited the curiosity in the anonymity of it, that he read the letter through a second and a third time, and said at last: “It would be interesting, though, to know who the writer is!” In fact, things were becoming serious, as may be seen. He spent more than an hour brooding over it. At last, flinging wide his hands and nodding his head, he said: “The letter is very, very fancifully written!” Then, I need hardly say, the letter was folded up and put in his case beside an advertisement and an invitation to a wedding, which had been preserved for seven years in the same place and position. Shortly afterwards an invitation actually was brought him for the governor’s ball, a very common event in provincial towns: where there is a governor, there is a ball, or the nobility would not pay him due respect and love.","This greatly interested Chichikov. Indeed, there was so much that was alluring and provocative of curiosity in the anonymous missive that he read it through a second time, and then a third, and finally said to himself: “I SHOULD like to know who sent it!” In short, he took the thing seriously, and spent over an hour in considering the same. At length, muttering a comment upon the epistle’s efflorescent style, he refolded the document, and committed it to his dispatch-box in company with a play-bill and an invitation to a wedding—the latter of which had for the last seven years reposed in the self-same receptacle and in the self-same position. Shortly afterwards there arrived a card of invitation to the Governor’s ball already referred to. In passing, it may be said that such festivities are not infrequent phenomena in county towns, for the reason that where Governors exist there must take place balls if from the local gentry there is to be evoked that respectful affection which is every Governor’s due.","This greatly intrigued him. The anonymity had so much that was alluring and arousing of curiosity in it, that he read it over again and then a third time, and finally said: “It would be curious, however, to know who the writer might be!” In short, it looked as if the matter was turning serious; for more than an hour he kept thinking about it, and at last, spreading his arms and inclining his head, he said: “The letter is very, very fancily written!” After which, it goes without saying, the letter was folded and put away in the chest, in the vicinity of some playbill and a wedding invitation preserved for seven years in the same position and the same place. A short time later he was in fact brought an invitation to the governor’s ball—quite a usual thing in provincial capitals: where the governor is, there will also be a ball, otherwise there would be no love or respect on the part of the nobility.","This piqued his interest very much. There was so much about the anonymity of the letter that was enticing and that excited the curiosity, that he read it through a second time, and a third, and said, at last: “Well, now, it would be curious to know just who wrote that!” In brief, the matter evidently became serious, for he kept mulling it over for more than an hour. At last, throwing up his arms and cocking his head, he said: “The letter is surely written in a very, very flowery way!” After which, it need hardly be said, the letter was folded up and tucked away in the traveling chest, next to some theatrical handbill or other and an engraved wedding invitation which had been preserved for seven years in the same position and the same spot. A little later, sure enough, an invitation to the Governor’s ball was brought to him, balls being quite the usual thing in provincial capitals; where the Governor is, there is bound to be a ball, otherwise the proper affection and respect on the part of the gentry would never be forthcoming."

Не знаю, удастся ли это сделать, но буду стараться. Если же, паче чаянья, удастся, Павел Иванович, — я попрошу у вас награды за труды: бросьте все эти поползновенья на эти приобретения. Говорю вам по чести, что, если бы я и всего лишился моего имущества, — а у меня его больше, чем у вас, — я бы не заплакал. Ей-ей, дело не в этом имуществе, которое могут у меня конфисковать, а в том, которого никто не может украсть и отнять! Вы уж пожили на свете довольно. Вы сами называете жизнь свою судном среди волн. У вас есть уже чем прожить остаток дней. Поселитесь себе в тихом уголке, поближе к церкви и простым, добрым людям; или, если знобит сильное желанье оставить по себе потомков, женитесь на небогатой доброй девушке, привыкшей к умеренности и простому хозяйству. Забудьте этот шумный мир и все его обольстительные прихоти; пусть и он вас позабудет. В нем нет успокоенья.

But I will do my best to alleviate your lot and free you. I don't know if I can do it, but I will try.

Hey, it's not about this property, which can be confiscated from me, but about the one that no one can steal and take away! You have already lived enough in the world.

You see: everything in him is an enemy, a tempter or a traitor.","“Pavel Ivanovitch!” said Murazov, and he paused. “To save you is not in my power, you see it yourself. But I will do everything I can to alleviate your lot and set you free. I don’t know whether I shall succeed in doing that, but I will try. If I should succeed beyond my expectation, Pavel Ivanovitch, I beg of you a favour in return for my trouble; abandon all these crooked means of making gain. I tell you on my honour that if I were deprived of all my property—and I have more than you—I should not weep. Aie, aie, it is not those possessions which can be confiscated that matter, but those which no one can steal or take away from us! You have lived in the world long enough.

Sincerely do I assure you that, were I myself to be deprived of my property (and my property greatly exceeds yours in magnitude) , I should not shed a single tear. It is not the property of which men can deprive us that matters, but the property of which no one on earth can deprive or despoil us. You are a man who has seen something of life—to use your own words, you have been a barque tossed hither and thither by tempestuous waves: yet still will there be left to you a remnant of substance on which to live, and therefore I beseech you to settle down in some quiet nook where there is a church, and where none but plain, good-hearted folk abide. Or, should you feel a yearning to leave behind you posterity, take in marriage a good woman who shall bring you, not money, but an aptitude for simple, modest domestic life.

Let Sobakevitch go to the devil, and come to MY place, where at least I shall have a piece of sturgeon to offer you for dinner. Ponomarev said to me on parting: ‘This piece is just the thing for you.

I tell you that in advance.” Here he broke off to run to the window and shout to his servant (who was holding a knife in one hand and a crust of bread and a piece of sturgeon in the other—he had contrived to filch the latter while fumbling in the britchka for something else): “Hi, Porphyri! Bring here that puppy, you rascal! What a puppy it is! Unfortunately that thief of a landlord has given it nothing to eat, even though I have promised him the roan filly which, as you may remember, I swopped from Khvostirev.” As a matter of act, Chichikov had never in his life seen either Khvostirev or the roan filly.","“But you’ll be sorry you were ever born when you get there, he’s a real jew-eater!

Listen to me, brother, you just send that Sobakevich packing to the Devil, now! Let’s you and me go to my place! What salted sturgeon steak I’ll treat you to! How Ponomarev, the low-down beast, scraped and bowed as he told me: ‘It’s only to you I’d sell it; you could search the whole fair through,’ he says, ‘and never find the like of that sturgeon.’ He’s a terrible rogue, just the same. I told him as much to his face. ‘ You,’ I told him, ‘and our tax-farmer are swindlers of the first water.’ He laughs, the low-down beast, and just strokes his beard. Kuvshinnikov and I breakfasted at his place every day. Ah, brother, here’s what I forgot to tell you—I know you’ll pester the life out of me after you see it, but I won’t give it up to you, not for ten thousand I won’t , I’m telling you that beforehand. Hey, there, Porfirii!” he began shouting, walking up to the window, calling his servant, who was holding a small knife in one hand and in the other a crust of bread with a piece of dried and salted sturgeon which he had had the luck to cut off as he had been taking something out of the carriage. “Hey, there, Porfirii!” Nozdrev shouted. “Fetch that pup, now! What a pup!” he went on, turning to Chichikov. “It’s stolen; its owner would rather have given up his own life than give up that pup. I promised him the light-chestnut mare—you remember, the one I got in a swap from Khvostyrev—”"
"— Помилуй, на что ж мне жеребец? — сказал Чичиков, изумленный в самом деле таким предложением.","“Forgive me, what do I need a stallion for? said Chichikov, really amazed at such a proposal.","“Upon my soul, what do I want with a stallion?” said Tchitchikov, genuinely astounded at such a proposition.","“But what should I want with your colt?” said Chichikov, genuinely astonished at the proposal.","“For pity’s sake, what do I need a stallion for?” said Chichikov, amazed indeed at such an offer.","“Good heavens, what would I do with a stallion?” asked Chichikov, really astonished by such a proposal."

"И туловище генерала стало колебаться от смеха. Плечи, носившие некогда густые эполеты, тряслись, точно как бы носили и поныне густые эполеты.","And the general's torso began to tremble with laughter. Shoulders that once wore thick epaulettes trembled, as if thick epaulettes were still worn.",And the general’s huge frame began quivering with laughter. His shoulders which had once worn fringed epaulettes shook as though they were still wearing fringed epaulettes.,"Chichikov bowed so low and so long that, by the time that his eyes had ceased to see nothing but his own boots, the General’s daughter had disappeared, and in her place was standing a bewhiskered butler, armed with a silver soap-dish and a hand-basin.",And the general’s body began to heave with laughter. Those shoulders that had once borne thick epaulettes were shaking as if even now they bore thick epaulettes.,
"— Ну это завещанье — вздор. Оно ничего не значит, оно уничтожено вторым.","“Well, this will is nonsense. It means nothing, it is destroyed by the second.","“But that will is all nonsense.

"Манилов совершенно растерялся. Он чувствовал, что ему нужно что-то сделать, предложить вопрос, а какой вопрос — черт его знает.

"— Совершенно так! — сказал Чичиков. — Зачем же трудиться, как не затем, чтобы, точно, иметь хорошую вещь?","— Quite so! Chichikov said. “Why work hard, if not to, for sure, have a good thing?”",Isn’t that right?” “Perfectly right!” said Tchitchikov. “Why give oneself a lot of trouble if not to have really good things?”,"Carrying the roll of stuff to the light—even stepping into the street for the purpose—the shopman unfolded his prize with the words, “A truly beautiful shade! A cloth of smoked grey, shot with flame colour!” The material met with the customer’s approval, a price was agreed upon, and with incredible celerity the vendor made up the purchase into a brown-paper parcel, and stowed it away in Chichikov’s koliaska.","Right?” “Absolutely right!” said Chichikov. “Why work, if it’s not so as to have something really good?”",

"«Эк ее, дубинноголовая какая! — сказал про себя Чичиков, уже начиная выходить из терпения. — Пойди ты сладь с нею! в пот бросила, проклятая старуха!» Тут он, вынувши из кармана платок, начал отирать пот, в самом деле выступивший на лбу. Впрочем, Чичиков напрасно сердился: иной и почтенный, и государственный даже человек, а на деле выходит совершенная Коробочка. Как зарубил что себе в голову, то уж ничем его не пересилить; сколько ни представляй ему доводов, ясных как день, все отскакивает от него, как резинный мяч отскакивает от стены. Отерши пот, Чичиков решился попробовать, нельзя ли ее навести на путь какою-нибудь иною стороною.","“Ek her, what a clubhead! Chichikov said to himself, already beginning to lose his patience. - Go and deal with her! I broke into a sweat, you damned old woman!” Here he, taking a handkerchief out of his pocket, began to wipe off the sweat that had actually come out on his forehead. However, Chichikov was needlessly angry: a different and respectable, and even statesman man, but in reality it turns out to be a perfect Korobochka. As he hacked something into his head, then nothing could overpower him; no matter how you present him with arguments, clear as day, everything bounces off him, like a rubber ball bounces off a wall. Wiping off the sweat, Chichikov made up his mind to try to see if it was possible to lead her on the path some other way.","“Ugh, she is as stupid as a post,” said Tchitchikov to himself, beginning to lose patience. “However is one to come to terms with her! She makes me feel hot all over, the confounded old woman!” And, taking a handkerchief out of his pocket, he began mopping his perspiring brow. Tchitchikov need not have been moved to anger, however: many a highly respected man, many a statesman indeed is a regular Korobotchka in business. Once he has taken a notion into his head there is no getting over it, anyhow: however many arguments as clear as daylight you put before him, they all rebound from him as an india-rubber ball bounces from a wall. After mopping his brow Tchitchikov made up his mind to try whether he could not get round her from some other side.","“What a blockhead of a creature!” said Chichikov to himself, for he was beginning to lose patience. “Bless her heart, I may as well be going. She has thrown me into a perfect sweat, the cursed old shrew!” He took a handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped the perspiration from his brow. Yet he need not have flown into such a passion. More than one respected statesman reveals himself, when confronted with a business matter, to be just such another as Madam Korobotchka, in that, once he has got an idea into his head, there is no getting it out of him —you may ply him with daylight-clear arguments, yet they will rebound from his brain as an india-rubber ball rebounds from a flagstone. Nevertheless, wiping away the perspiration, Chichikov resolved to try whether he could not bring her back to the road by another path.","“Bah, what a blockhead!” Chichikov said to himself, beginning to lose patience now. “Go, try getting along with her! I’m all in a sweat, the damned hag!” Here he took his handkerchief from his pocket and began mopping the sweat which in fact stood out on his brow. However, Chichikov need not have been angry: a man can be greatly respectable, even statesmanly, and in reality turn out to be a perfect Korobochka. Once he gets a thing stuck in his head, there’s no overcoming him; present him with as many arguments as you like, all clear as day—everything bounces off him, like a rubber ball bouncing off a wall. Having mopped his sweat, Chichikov decided to see whether she could be guided onto the path from another side.","“May the Devil take her! What a blockhead—her head must be made of oak,” said Chichikov to himself, by now beginning to lose his patience. “Try and come to terms with her! She’s making me sweat, the damned old hag!” Here, taking out his handkerchief, he began mopping the sweat that was now actually beading his forehead. However, it was in vain that Chichikov was getting worked up about her: at times you’ll come across a man who is highly respected and is even in the government’s employ, yet when it comes down to doing business with him, he will turn out to be a perfect Korobochka. Once such a man gets a notion into his head, there’s no earthly means of your overcoming him; no matter how many arguments that are as clear as day you may present to him, they will bounce off him the way a rubber ball bounces off a wall. Having mopped his sweat, Chichikov decided to see if there weren’t some other way of setting her on the right path."
"Князь задумался. В это время вошел молодой чиновник и почтительно остановился с портфелем. Забота, труд выражались на его молодом и еще свежем лице. Видно было, что он недаром служил по особым порученьям. Это был один из числа тех немногих, который занимался делопроизводством. Не сгорая ни честолюбием, ни желаньем прибытков, ни подражаньем другим, он занимался только потому, что был убежден, что ему нужно быть здесь, а не на другом месте, что для этого дана ему жизнь. Следить, разобрать по частям и, поймавши все нити запутаннейшего дела, разъяснить его — это было его дело. И труды, и старания, и бессонные ночи вознаграждались ему изобильно, если дело наконец начинало перед ним объясняться, сокровенные причины обнаруживаться, и он чувствовал, что может передать его все в немногих словах, отчетливо и ясно, так что всякому будет очевидно и понятно. Можно сказать, что не столько радовался ученик, когда пред ним раскрывалась какая-нибудь труднейшая фраза и обнаруживается настоящий смысл мысли великого писателя, как радовался он, когда пред ним распутывалось запутаннейшее дело. Зато…[48]","The prince considered. At that moment a young official entered and respectfully stopped with a briefcase. Care, labor were expressed on his young and still fresh face. It was evident that he had not served on special assignments for nothing. He was one of the few who did business. Burning with neither ambition, nor desire for profit, nor imitation of others, he worked only because he was convinced that he needed to be here, and not in another place, that life was given to him for this. To follow, to disassemble in parts and, having caught all the threads of the most complicated case, to explain it - that was his business. And labors, and efforts, and sleepless nights were richly rewarded to him, if the matter finally began to be explained to him, the hidden reasons were revealed, and he felt that he could convey it all in a few words, distinctly and clearly, so that it would be obvious and understandable to everyone. It can be said that the student was not so happy when some most difficult phrase was revealed before him and the real meaning of the thought of the great writer was revealed, as he was happy when the most complicated matter was unraveled before him. But…[48]","The prince pondered. At that moment an official came in and stood waiting respectfully with his portfolio. There was a look of hard work and anxiety on his still young and fresh face. It could be seen that it was not for nothing that he served on special commissions. He was one of those few officials who do their work con amore. Not excited by ambition nor desire of gain, nor imitation of others, he worked simply because he was convinced that he ought to be here and in no other place, and that this was the object of his life. To investigate, to analyse, and after extricating all the threads of a tangled case, to make it clear was his task. And his toil and his efforts and his sleepless nights were abundantly rewarded if the case at last began to grow clear before his eyes, and its hidden causes to be laid bare, and he felt he could present it all clearly and distinctly in full words. One may say no schoolboy rejoices more when some difficult sentence is unravelled and the real meaning of a great writer’s thought becomes apparent to him, than he rejoiced when an intricate case was disentangled. On the other hand ... (A page of the manuscript was torn out at this point","The Prince relapsed into thought; until presently there entered a young tchinovnik. Portfolio in hand, this official stood waiting respectfully. Care and hard work had already imprinted their insignia upon his fresh young face; for evidently he had not been in the Service for nothing. As a matter of fact, his greatest joy was to labour at a tangled case, and successfully to unravel it. [At this point a long hiatus occurs in the original.]","The prince lapsed into thought. At that moment a young official came in and stood deferentially, a portfolio in his hand. Care and travail showed on his young and still fresh face. One could see it was not for nothing that he served as a special agent. He belonged to the number of those few who do their clerical work con amore. Burning neither with ambition, nor with the desire for gain, nor with the imitation of others, he worked only because he was convinced that he had to be there and nowhere else, that life had been given him for that. To pursue, to analyze, and, having grasped all the threads of the most complicated case, to explain it—this was the thing for him. The labors, the efforts, the sleepless nights were abundantly rewarded if the case finally began to clarify itself before him, and the hidden causes revealed themselves, so that he felt he could convey the whole of it in a few words, clearly and distinctly, in such fashion that it would be obvious and understandable to anyone. It could be said that a student does not rejoice so much when some very difficult phrase and the true meaning of a great writer’s thought are revealed to him, as he rejoiced when a very tangled case untangled itself before him.",

"— Ты сам видишь, что с тобою нет возможности играть.",You can see for yourself that there is no way to play with you.,“You can see yourself that it is impossible to play with you.”,Surely you can see for yourself that such a thing is impossible?” “That cock won’t fight.,“You can see for yourself that it’s impossible to play with you.”,“You can see for yourself that it’s impossible to play with you.”
"Он отвечал, что уже имел счастие нечаянным образом познакомиться; попробовал еще кое-что прибавить, но кое-что совсем не вышло. Губернаторша, сказав два-три слова, наконец отошла с дочерью в другой конец залы к другим гостям, а Чичиков все еще стоял неподвижно на одном и том же месте, как человек, который весело вышел на улицу, с тем чтобы прогуляться, с глазами, расположенными глядеть на все, и вдруг неподвижно остановился вспомнив, что он позабыл что-то, и уж тогда глупее ничего не может быть такого человека: вмиг беззаботное выражение слетает с лица его; он силится припомнить, что позабыл он, — не платок ли? но платок в кармане; не деньги ли? но деньги тоже в кармане, все, кажется, при нем, а между тем какой-то неведомый дух шепчет ему в уши, что он позабыл что-то. И вот уже глядит он растерянно и смущенно на движущуюся толпу перед ним, на летающие экипажи, на кивера и ружья проходящего полка, на вывеску — и ничего хорошо не видит. Так и Чичиков вдруг сделался чуждым всему, что ни происходило вокруг него. В это время из дамских благовонных уст к нему устремилось множество намеков и вопросов, проникнутых насквозь тонкостию и любезностию. «Позволено ли нам, бедным жителям земли, быть так дерзкими, чтобы спросить вас, о чем мечтаете?» — «Где находятся те счастливые места, в которых порхает мысль ваша?» — «Можно ли знать имя той, которая погрузила вас в эту сладкую долину задумчивости?» Но он отвечал на все решительным невниманием, и приятные фразы канули, как в воду. Он даже до того был неучтив, что скоро ушел от них в другую сторону, желая повысмотреть, куда ушла губернаторша с своей дочкой. Но дамы, кажется, не хотели оставить его так скоро; каждая внутренно решилась употребить всевозможные орудия, столь опасные для сердец наших, и пустить в ход все, что было лучшего. Нужно заметить, что у некоторых дам, — я говорю у некоторых, это не то, что у всех, — есть маленькая слабость: если они заметят у себя что-нибудь особенно хорошее лоб ли, рот ли, руки ли, то уже думают, что лучшая часть лица их так первая и бросится всем в глаза и все вдруг заговорят в один голос: «Посмотрите, посмотрите, какой у ней прекрасный греческий нос!» или: «Какой правильный, очаровательный лоб!» У которой же хороши плечи, та уверена заранее, что все молодые люди будут совершенно восхищены и то и дело станут повторять в то время, когда она будет проходить мимо: «Ах, какие чудесные у этой плечи», — а на лицо, волосы, нос, лоб даже не взглянут, если же и взглянут, то как на что-то постороннее. Таким образом думают иные дамы. Каждая дама дала себе внутренний обет быть как можно очаровательней в танцах и показать во всем блеске превосходство того, что у нее было самого превосходного. Почтмейстерша, вальсируя, с такой томностию опустила набок голову, что слышалось в самом деле что-то неземное. Одна очень любезная дама, — которая приехала вовсе не с тем чтобы танцевать, по причине приключившегося, как сама выразилась, небольшого инкомодите[18] в виде горошинки на правой ноге, вследствие чего должна была даже надеть плисовые сапоги, — не вытерпела, однако же, и сделала несколько кругов в плисовых сапогах, для того именно, чтобы почтмейстерша не забрала в самом деле слишком много себе в голову.","He replied that he had already had the good fortune to make his acquaintance by chance; I tried to add something else, but something did not work out at all. The governor's wife, having said two or three words, finally went with her daughter to the other end of the hall to the other guests, and Chichikov still stood motionless in the same place, like a man who merrily went out into the street in order to take a walk, with eyes disposed to look at everything, and suddenly stopped motionless, remembering that he had forgotten something, and even then nothing could be more stupid than such a person: in an instant, a carefree expression flies from his face; he struggles to remember what he has forgotten—isn't it a handkerchief? but a handkerchief in his pocket; isn't it money? but the money is also in his pocket, everything seems to be with him, and meanwhile some unknown spirit whispers in his ears that he has forgotten something. And now he looks bewildered and embarrassed at the moving crowd in front of him, at the flying carriages, at the shako and guns of the passing regiment, at the sign - and sees nothing well. So Chichikov suddenly became a stranger to everything that happened around him. At this time, from the ladies' fragrant lips, many hints and questions rushed to him, imbued through and through with subtlety and courtesy. “Are we, the poor inhabitants of the earth, allowed to be so bold as to ask you what you dream about?” “Where are those happy places where your thought flutters?” “May I know the name of the one who plunged you into this sweet valley of thought?” But he answered everything with resolute inattention, and pleasant phrases vanished like water. He was even so discourteous that he soon left them in the other direction, wanting to see where the governor's wife and her daughter had gone. But the ladies didn't seem to want to leave him so soon; each inwardly decided to use all kinds of weapons, so dangerous for our hearts, and to use everything that was best. It should be noted that some ladies - I say some, it's not like everyone else - have a little weakness: if they notice something especially good in their forehead, mouth, or hands, they already think that the best part of their face is so first and catches everyone's eyes, and everyone suddenly speaks with one voice: “Look, look what a beautiful Greek nose she has!” or: ""What a proper, charming forehead!"" The one who has good shoulders, she is sure in advance that all young people will be completely delighted and will repeat every now and then at the time when she passes by: “Oh, what wonderful shoulders this one has,” and on her face, hair, nose, forehead, they don’t even look, and if they do, it’s like something extraneous. This is how other women think. Each lady made an inner vow to herself to be as charming as possible in dancing and to show in all its splendor the superiority of what was most excellent in her. The postmaster, waltzing, lowered her head to one side with such languor that something unearthly was indeed heard. One very amiable lady—who had not come at all to dance, because, as she put it herself, had happened to be a small incomodite[18] in the form of a pea on her right leg, as a result of which she even had to put on plush boots—could not bear it, however , and made a few circles in plush boots, precisely so that the postmaster would not really take too much into her head.","He said that he had already by chance had the happiness of making her acquaintance; he tried to say something more, but the something more did not come off. The governor’s wife said two or three words, and then went off with her daughter to the other end of the drawing-room to talk to other guests; while Tchitchikov still remained motionless at the same spot, like a man who having gaily sal-lied out into the street for a walk, with eyes disposed to observe everything, suddenly stands stock-still thinking he has forgotten something; and nothing can look stupider than such a man: instantly, the careless expression vanishes from his face; he struggles to recall what he has forgotten: was it his handkerchief?—but his handkerchief is still in his pocket; was it his money?—but his money too is in his pocket, he seems to have everything, but yet some unseen spirit keeps whispering in his ear that he has forgotten something. And now he looks blankly and absent-mindedly at the moving crowd before him, at the carriages dashing by, at the shakoscu and guns of the regiment marching by, at the signboard on the shop, and sees nothing clearly. So Tchitchikov suddenly became aloof from all that was passing around him. Meanwhile a number of hints and questions saturated with refinement and politeness were aimed at him from the fragrant lips of the ladies, such as: “Is it permissible for us, poor dwellers in this earthly sphere, to be so audacious as to ask the subject of your dreams?” “Where may those happy regions be to which your thoughts have taken flight?” “May we know the name of her who has plunged you into this sweet vale of reverie.” But he paid absolutely no attention, and the agreeable phrases were completely thrown away. He was even so uncivil as to walk away from them hurriedly to the other end of the room, anxious to find out where the governor’s wife had gone with her daughter. But the ladies were not, it seemed, disposed to let him escape so easily, every one of them inwardly determined to use all those weapons so menacing to the peace of our hearts, and to turn her best points to the best possible advantage. I must observe that some ladies—I say some, that is, not all ladies—have a little weakness: if a lady notices anything particularly attractive in herself—whether lips or brow or hand—she is apt to imagine that her best point is conspicuous and is attracting the notice of every one, and that all are saying with one voice: “ Look, look, hasn’t she a lovely Grecian nose!” or, “What a smooth and fascinating brow!” One who has good shoulders is confident that all the young men will be completely captivated, and will be continually repeating when she passes: “What marvellous shoulders she has!” and that they will not glance at her face , her hair, her nose, her brow, or if they do, it will be as at something quite apart. That is what some ladies imagine. Every lady took an inward vow to be as fascinating as possible in the dances, and to display in all the brilliance of its perfection whatever was most perfect in her. The postmaster’s wife put her head on one side so languishingly as she waltzed that it really gave one a feeling of something unearthly. One very amiable lady who had come with no idea of dancing at all on account of, as she herself expressed it, a slight incommodity in the shape of a small callos ity on her right foot, in consequence of which she had actually been obliged to put on plush boots, could not resist joining the dance and taking a few turns in her plush boots, solely to prevent the postmaster’s wife from really thinking too much of herself.","He replied that he HAD had the happiness of meeting Mademoiselle before, and under rather unexpected circumstances; but on his trying to say something further his tongue completely failed him. The Governor’s wife added a word or two, and then carried off her daughter to speak to some of the other guests. Chichikov stood rooted to the spot, like a man who, after issuing into the street for a pleasant walk, has suddenly come to a halt on remembering that something has been left behind him. In a moment, as he struggles to recall what that something is, the mien of careless expectancy disappears from his face, and he no longer sees a single person or a single object in his vicinity. In the same way did Chichikov suddenly become oblivious to the scene around him. Yet all the while the melodious tongues of ladies were plying him with multitudinous hints and questions—hints and questions inspired with a desire to captivate. “Might we poor cumberers of the ground make so bold as to ask you what you are thinking of?” “Pray tell us where lie the happy regions in which your thoughts are wandering?” “Might we be informed of the name of her who has plunged you into this sweet abandonment of meditation?”—such were the phrases thrown at him. But to everything he turned a dead ear, and the phrases in question might as well have been stones dropped into a pool. Indeed, his rudeness soon reached the pitch of his walking away altogether, in order that he might go and reconnoitre wither the Governor’s wife and daughter had retreated. But the ladies were not going to let him off so easily. Every one of them had made up her mind to use upon him her every weapon, and to exhibit whatsoever might chance to constitute her best point. Yet the ladies’ wiles proved useless, for Chichikov paid not the smallest attention to them, even when the dancing had begun, but kept raising himself on tiptoe to peer over people’s heads and ascertain in which direction the bewitching maiden with the golden hair had gone. Also, when seated, he continued to peep between his neighbours’ backs and shoulders, until at last he discovered her sitting beside her mother, who was wearing a sort of Oriental turban and feather. Upon that one would have thought that his purpose was to carry the position by storm; for, whether moved by the influence of spring, or whether moved by a push from behind, he pressed forward with such desperate resolution that his elbow caused the Commissioner of Taxes to stagger on his feet, and would have caused him to lose his balance altogether but for the supporting row of guests in the rear. Likewise the Postmaster was made to give ground; whereupon he turned and eyed Chichikov with mingled astonishment and subtle irony.","He replied that he had already had the happiness of accidentally making her acquaintance; tried to add something more, but the something did not come off at all. The governor’s wife, after saying two or three words, finally walked away with her daughter to other guests at the other end of the ballroom, while Chichikov still stood motionless on the same spot, like a man who merrily goes out for a stroll, his eyes disposed to look at everything, and suddenly stops motionless, recalling that he has forgotten something, and there can be nothing stupider than such a man then: instantly the carefree expression leaves his face; he strains to remember what he has forgotten—was it his handkerchief? but his handkerchief is in his pocket; was it money? but his money is also in his pocket; he seems to have everything, and yet some unknown spirit whispers in his ear that he has forgotten something. And so he now looks vaguely and perplexedly at the crowd moving before him, at the carriages flying along, at the shakos and guns of the regiment passing by, at the signboards—and sees nothing clearly. So, too, did Chichikov suddenly become a stranger to everything going on around him. During this time the ladies’ fragrant lips poured at him a multitude of hints and questions, thoroughly pervaded by subtlety and courtesy. “Is it permitted us poor earth-dwellers to be so bold as to ask what you are dreaming about?” “Where are those happy places in which your thought is fluttering?” “May we know the name of her who has plunged you into this sweet vale of reverie?” But he responded to it all with decided inattention, and the pleasant phrases vanished into thin air. He was even so impolite as to walk away from them soon, over to the other side, wishing to spy out where the governor’s wife had gone with her daughter. But the ladies seemed unwilling to give him up so soon; each of them resolved inwardly to employ all possible means, so dangerous for our hearts, and bring her best into play. It should be noted that some ladies—I say some, which is not the same as all—have a little weakness: if they notice that they have something particularly good—brow, or lips, or arms—they right away think that their best feature will be the first to catch everyone’s eye, and that they will all suddenly start saying with one voice: “Look, look, what a fine Greek nose she has!” or “What a well-formed, lovely brow!” And she who has handsome shoulders is certain beforehand that all the young men will be utterly enraptured and will not cease repeating as she passes by: “Ah, how wonderful those shoulders are!” and will not even glance at her face, hair, nose, brow, or, if they do, only as at something beside the point. So certain ladies think. Each lady inwardly vowed to herself to be as charming as possible while dancing and show in all its splendor the excellence of that which was most excellent in her. The postmaster’s wife, as she waltzed, held her head to one side with such languor that it indeed gave one the feeling of something unearthly. One very amiable lady—who had by no means come with the intention of dancing, owing to the occurrence, as she herself put it, of a slight incommodité, in the form of a little bump on her right foot, as a result of which she even had to wear velveteen booties—was nevertheless unable to help herself and took several turns in her velveteen booties, precisely so that the postmaster’s wife should not indeed take too much into her head.","He answered that he already had had the good fortune to encounter her by chance; he made an attempt to add something else, but that something else did not turn out well. The Governor’s lady, after a few more words, at last went off with her daughter to another part of the room to the other guests, but Chichikov still did not stir from the spot, like a man who has gaily sallied out of doors for a stroll, his eyes disposed to take in all the sights, and then suddenly comes to a dead stop, remembering that he has forgotten something; and when that happens you won’t find anything sillier than this individual: in an instant the carefree expression deserts his face; he strives to recall just what it is he has forgotten: was it a handkerchief, by any chance? But the handkerchief is right in his pocket. Is it money, perhaps? But the money, too, is right in his pocket; he has everything with him, and yet at the same time some unseen demon is whispering into his ears that he has forgotten something. And by this time he’s staring absentmindedly and in a muddled way at the throng moving past him, at the vehicles dashing by, at the shakos and guns of a regiment on the march, or even at some sign, yet without really seeing a thing. And so it was with Chichikov: he suddenly became alien to everything that was going on about him. At this point a multitude of hints and questions permeated with finesse and politesse was directed at him from fragrant feminine lips: “Is it permitted for us poor dwellers upon this earth to make so bold as to inquire what the subject of your reveries is?” “Where are located those happy regions where your thought is soaring?” “May one know the name of her who has plunged you into this sweet vale of pensiveness?” But his response to all this was utter inattentiveness and the pleasant phrases were entirely lost on him. He was actually uncivil to such an extent that in a short while he left them and went over to the other side of the room, wishing to spy out where the Governor’s lady had gone with her daughter. But the ladies apparently did not feel like giving him up so quickly as all that: each one had inwardly resolved to resort to all those weapons so dangerous for our hearts and to utilize all that was best and most effective in her armory. It must be remarked that certain ladies—I am saying certain ladies, which is not the same as saying all ladies—have a little weakness: if they should happen to notice some especially fine point about themselves, be it the brow, or the mouth, or the hands, why, they already think that the best feature will be the first thing to strike the eyes of all beholders and that all these beholders will instantly begin saying in the same voice: “Look, look what a splendidly beautiful Grecian nose she has!” or: “What a regular, enchanting brow!” As for her who has fine shoulders, she feels certain beforehand that all the young men will go off into utter raptures and will be incessantly repeating every time she passes by: “Ah, what marvelous shoulders that one has!” and feels certain that they won’t so much as glance at her face, or hair, or nose, or forehead; but, should they happen to glance at them, they will be regarded as merely extraneous. That’s the way certain ladies think. Each lady took an inner vow to be as enchanting as possible during the dances and to display in all its splendor the surpassing excellency of whatever was most surpassingly excellent about her. The Postmaster’s good lady, while waltzing, let her head loll to one side in such a languishing manner that one really sensed something not of this mundane sphere about her. One very amiable lady—who had come here not at all for the dancing, because of a slight incommodite, as she put it, which had befallen her, in the form of a pea-shaped growth on her right foot, and who in consequence thereof had actually been forced to wear plush booties—why, even she had not been able to hold out, in spite of everything, and circled a few times in her plush booties, for the specific purpose of not letting the Postmaster’s good lady really get too many high and mighty notions into her head."
"Ноздрев был в некотором отношении исторический человек. Ни на одном собрании, где он был, не обходилось без истории. Какая-нибудь история непременно происходила: или выведут его под руки из зала жандармы, или принуждены бывают вытолкать свои же приятели. Если же этого не случится, то все-таки что-нибудь да будет такое, чего с другим никак не будет: или нарежется в буфете таким образом, что только смеется, или проврется самым жестоким образом, так что наконец самому сделается совестно. И наврет совершенно без всякой нужды: вдруг расскажет, что у него была лошадь какой-нибудь голубой или розовой шерсти, и тому подобную чепуху, так что слушающие наконец все отходят, произнесши: «Ну, брат, ты, кажется, уже начал пули лить». Есть люди, имеющие страстишку нагадить ближнему, иногда вовсе без всякой причины. Иной, например, даже человек в чинах, с благородною наружностию, со звездой на груди, будет вам жать руку, разговорится с вами о предметах глубоких, вызывающих на размышления, а потом, смотришь, тут же, пред вашими глазами, и нагадит вам. И нагадит так, как простой коллежский регистратор, а вовсе не так, как человек со звездой на груди, разговаривающий о предметах, вызывающих на размышление, так что стоишь только да дивишься, пожимая плечами, да и ничего более. Такую же странную страсть имел и Ноздрев. Чем кто ближе с ним сходился, тому он скорее всех насаливал: распускал небылицу, глупее которой трудно выдумать, расстроивал свадьбу, торговую сделку и вовсе не почитал себя вашим неприятелем; напротив, если случай приводил его опять встретиться с вами, он обходился вновь по-дружески и даже говорил: «Ведь ты такой подлец, никогда ко мне не заедешь». Ноздрев во многих отношениях был многосторонний человек, то есть человек на все руки. В ту же минуту он предлагал вам ехать куда угодно, хоть на край света, войти в какое хотите предприятие, менять все что ни есть на все, что хотите. Ружье, собака, лошадь — все было предметом мены, но вовсе не с тем, чтобы выиграть: это происходило просто от какой-то неугомонной юркости и бойкости характера. Если ему на ярмарке посчастливилось напасть на простака и обыграть его, он накупал кучу всего, что прежде попадалось ему на глаза в лавках: хомутов, курительных свечек, платков для няньки, жеребца, изюму, серебряный рукомойник, голландского холста, крупичатой муки, табаку, пистолетов, селедок, картин, точильный инструмент, горшков, сапогов, фаянсовую посуду — насколько хватало денег. Впрочем, редко случалось, чтобы это было довезено домой; почти в тот же день спускалось оно все другому, счастливейшему игроку, иногда даже прибавлялась собственная трубка с кисетом и мундштуком, а в другой раз и вся четверня со всем: с коляской и кучером, так что сам хозяин отправлялся в коротеньком сюртучке или архалуке искать какого-нибудь приятеля, чтобы попользоваться его экипажем. Вот какой был Ноздрев! Может быть, назовут его характером избитым, станут говорить, что теперь нет уже Ноздрева. Увы! несправедливы будут те, которые станут говорить так. Ноздрев долго еще не выведется из мира. Он везде между нами и, может быть, только ходит в другом кафтане; но легкомысленно непроницательны люди, и человек в другом кафтане кажется им другим человеком.","Nozdryov was in some respects a historical person. Not a single meeting where he was, did not do without a story. Some kind of story was bound to happen: either the gendarmes would lead him by the arms out of the gendarme hall, or they would be forced to push out their own friends. If this does not happen, then nevertheless something will happen that will never happen to another: either he will cut himself in the buffet in such a way that he only laughs, or he will lie in the most cruel way, so that at last he himself will become ashamed. And he will lie completely without any need: he will suddenly tell that he had a horse of some blue or pink wool, and similar nonsense, so that the listeners finally all leave, saying: “Well, brother, it seems you have already begun to pour bullets "". There are people who have a passion to spoil their neighbor, sometimes for no reason at all. Another, for example, even a man in rank, with a noble appearance, with a star on his chest, will shake hands with you, talk to you about deep subjects that cause reflection, and then, you look, right there, before your eyes, and spoil you. And he will spoil like a simple collegiate registrar, and not at all like a man with a star on his chest, talking about subjects that provoke reflection, so that you just stand and marvel, shrugging your shoulders, and nothing more. Nozdryov had the same strange passion. The closer someone got along with him, the sooner he would piss everyone off: he spread a fable, more stupid than which it is difficult to invent, upset a wedding, a trade deal, and did not at all consider himself your enemy; on the contrary, if chance brought him to meet with you again, he treated you again in a friendly way and even said: “After all, you are such a scoundrel, you will never come to me.” Nozdryov was in many respects a versatile person, that is, a man of all trades. At that very moment, he offered you to go anywhere, even to the ends of the world, to enter into any enterprise you want, to change everything that is for everything you want. A gun, a dog, a horse—everything was an object of exchange, but not at all in order to win: it came simply from some kind of restless briskness and glibness of character. If he was lucky enough to attack a simpleton at the fair and beat him, he bought a bunch of everything that he had previously come across in the shops: collars, smoking candles, nanny's handkerchiefs, a stallion, raisins, a silver washstand, Dutch linen, grain flour, tobacco, pistols, herrings, paintings, sharpening tools, pots, boots, faience utensils - as far as money was enough. However, it rarely happened that this was brought home; almost on the same day it all went down to another, the happiest player, sometimes even his own pipe with a pouch and a mouthpiece was added, and at other times the whole quadruple with everything: with a carriage and a coachman, so that the owner himself went in a short frock coat or arhaluk to look for what some buddy to use his carriage. That's what Nozdryov was like! Maybe they will call him a beaten character, they will say that now Nozdryov is no longer there. Alas! those who speak thus will be unjust. Nozdryov will not be out of the world for a long time. He is everywhere between us and, perhaps, only walks in a different caftan; but people are frivolously impenetrable, and a man in a different caftan seems to them a different person.","Nozdryov was in a certain sense an historical character. No gathering at which he was present went off without some “history.” Some sort of scandal invariably occurred: either he was conducted out of the ballroom by the police, or his friends were forced to eject him themselves. If that did not occur, something would be sure to happen that never would happen to any one else: either he would get so drunk at the refreshment bar that he did nothing but laugh, or he would tell such fantastic lies that at last he felt ashamed of himself. And he would lie without any provocation: he would suddenly assert that he had a horse whose coat was a light blue or pink colour, and nonsense of that sort, so that at last his listeners would walk away from him, saying: “Well, my lad, it seems you are drawing the long-bow.” There are people who have a passion for playing nasty tricks on their neighbours, sometimes without the slightest provocation. Even a man of good position and gentlemanly appearance, with a decoration on his breast will, for instance, shake hands, and converse with you on intellectual subjects that call for deep reflection, and in another minute before your very eyes he is playing you a nasty trick like the humblest little copying clerk and not at all like a man with a decoration on his breast conversing on subjects that call for deep reflection, so that you simply stand amazed and can do nothing but shrug your shoulders. Nozdryov had this strange passion too. The more intimate any one was with him, the readier he was to do him a bad turn; he would spread the most incredible tales which would have been hard to beat for silliness, upset a wedding or a business transaction, and all the while would be far from regarding himself as your enemy; on the contrary, if chance threw you with him again, he would behave in the most friendly way again and would even say: “You are a wretch, you never come to see me.” In a certain sense Nozdryov was a many-sided man, that is, a man who could turn his hand to anything. In the same breath he would offer to go with you to the furthest ends of the earth, to undertake any enterprise you might choose, to swop anything in the world for anything you like. Guns, dogs, horses, anything would do for a swop, not with the slightest idea of gain; it all sprang from an irresistible impetuosity and recklessness of character. If he had the luck to hit upon a simpleton at a fair and rook him, he bought masses of things because they caught his eye in the shops: horse collars, fumigating candles, kerchiefs for the nurse, a stallion, raisins, a silver washing-basin, holland linen, fine wheaten flour, tobacco, pistols, herrings, pictures, a lathe, pots, boots, china—as long as his money lasted. However, it rarely happened that all this wealth was carried home; almost the same day it would pass into the hands of some luckier gambler, sometimes even with the addition of a peculiar pipe with a tobacco pouch and a mouth-piece, and another time with all his four horses, carriage, and coachman, so that their former owner had to set to work in a short jacket or a jerkin to look out for a friend to give him a lift in his carriage. Such was Nozdryov! Perhaps he will be called a hackneyed character, and it will be said that there are no Nozdryovs now. Alas! those who say so are wrong. It will be many long years before the Nozdryovs are extinct. They are everywhere among us, and the only difference perhaps is that they are wearing a different cut of coat; but people are carelessly unobservant and a man in a different coat seems to them a different man.","In short, Nozdrev was, as it were, a man of incident. Never was he present at any gathering without some sort of a fracas occurring thereat. Either he would require to be expelled from the room by gendarmes, or his friends would have to kick him out into the street. At all events, should neither of those occurrences take place, at least he did something of a nature which would not otherwise have been witnessed. That is to say, should he not play the fool in a buffet to such an extent as to make every one smile, you may be sure that he was engaged in lying to a degree which at times abashed even himself. Moreover, the man lied without reason. For instance, he would begin telling a story to the effect that he possessed a blue-coated or a red-coated horse; until, in the end, his listeners would be forced to leave him with the remark, “You are giving us some fine stuff, old fellow!” Also, men like Nozdrev have a passion for insulting their neighbours without the least excuse afforded. (For that matter, even a man of good standing and of respectable exterior—a man with a star on his breast—may unexpectedly press your hand one day, and begin talking to you on subjects of a nature to give food for serious thought. Yet just as unexpectedly may that man start abusing you to your face—and do so in a manner worthy of a collegiate registrar rather than of a man who wears a star on his breast and aspires to converse on subjects which merit reflection. All that one can do in such a case is to stand shrugging one’s shoulders in amazement.) Well, Nozdrev had just such a weakness. The more he became friendly with a man, the sooner would he insult him, and be ready to spread calumnies as to his reputation. Yet all the while he would consider himself the insulted one’s friend, and, should he meet him again, would greet him in the most amicable style possible, and say, “You rascal, why have you given up coming to see me.” Thus, taken all round, Nozdrev was a person of many aspects and numerous potentialities. In one and the same breath would he propose to go with you whithersoever you might choose (even to the very ends of the world should you so require) or to enter upon any sort of an enterprise with you, or to exchange any commodity for any other commodity which you might care to name. Guns, horses, dogs, all were subjects for barter—though not for profit so far as YOU were concerned. Such traits are mostly the outcome of a boisterous temperament, as is additionally exemplified by the fact that if at a fair he chanced to fall in with a simpleton and to fleece him, he would then proceed to buy a quantity of the very first articles which came to hand—horse-collars, cigar-lighters, dresses for his nursemaid, foals, raisins, silver ewers, lengths of holland, wheatmeal, tobacco, revolvers, dried herrings, pictures, whetstones, crockery, boots, and so forth, until every atom of his money was exhausted. Yet seldom were these articles conveyed home, since, as a rule, the same day saw them lost to some more skilful gambler, in addition to his pipe, his tobacco-pouch, his mouthpiece, his four-horsed turn-out, and his coachman: with the result that, stripped to his very shirt, he would be forced to beg the loan of a vehicle from a friend. Such was Nozdrev. Some may say that characters of his type have become extinct, that Nozdrevs no longer exist. Alas! such as say this will be wrong; for many a day must pass before the Nozdrevs will have disappeared from our ken. Everywhere they are to be seen in our midst— the only difference between the new and the old being a difference of garments. Persons of superficial observation are apt to consider that a man clad in a different coat is quite a different person from what he used to be.","Nozdryov was in a certain respect a storied man. Not one gathering he attended went by without some story. Some sort of story inevitably occurred: either he was taken under the arm and removed from the hall by gendarmes, or his own friends were obliged to throw him out. And if that did not happen, then something else did, of a sort that never happened to others: either he would get so potted at the buffet that he could do nothing but laugh, or he would pour out such a wicked pack of lies that he would finally become ashamed himself. And he lied absolutely without any need: he would suddenly tell about a horse he had of some blue or pink color, or similar nonsense, so that his listeners would all finally walk away, saying: “Well, brother, it seems you’ve started talking through your hat.” There exist people who have something of a passion for doing dirt to their neighbor, sometimes without any reason. One, for example, even a man of a certain rank, with a noble appearance, with a star on his breast, will press your hands, will get to talking with you about profound subjects that invite reflection, and then, lo and behold, right there, before your very eyes, he does you dirt. And he does you dirt like a mere collegiate registrar, not at all like a man with a star on his breast who talks about subjects that invite reflection, so that you just stand there marveling, shrugging your shoulders, and nothing more. Nozdryov, too, had this strange passion. The closer you got with him, the sooner he would muck things up for you: spread some cock-and-bull story, than which it would be hard to invent a stupider, thwart a wedding or a business deal, and yet by no means consider himself your enemy; on the contrary, if chance should bring him together with you again, he would again treat you in a friendly way, and even say: “What a scoundrel you are, you never come to see me.” Nozdryov was in many respects a many-sided man, that is, a Jack-of-all-trades. In the same moment he would offer to go with you wherever you please, even to the ends of the earth, join in any undertaking you like, trade whatever there was for whatever you like. A gun, a dog, a horse—everything was up for trade, but not at all with a view to gain: it came simply from some irrepressible briskness and friskiness of character. If he was lucky enough to come across a simpleton at a fair and beat him at cards, he would buy up a heap of all that had first caught his eye in the shops: yokes, scented candles, kerchiefs for the nanny, a colt, raisins, a silver washbasin, Holland linen, cake flour, tobacco, pistols, herring, paintings, a grindstone, crockery, boots, faïence dishes—for all the money he had. However, it rarely happened that these things got brought home; almost the same day it would all be gambled away to another, luckier player, sometimes even with the addition of his own pipe, tobacco pouch and mouthpiece included, or another time with his entire four-in-hand, everything included: coach and coachman—so that the master himself had to set out in a short frock coat or a striped smock to look for some friend and use his carriage. Such was Nozdryov! People may call him a trite character, they may say that Nozdryov is no more. Alas! mistaken will they be who say so. It will be long before Nozdryov passes from this world. He is among us everywhere, and is perhaps only wearing a different caftan; but people are light-mindedly unperceptive, and a man in a different caftan seems to them a different man.","Nozdrev, in a certain respect, was a man of affairs: there was nary a gathering at which he was present where things got along without an affair. Some affair or other was inevitably bound to arise: either the gendarmes would lead him by the arm out of the hall, or none other than his own cronies would be compelled to heave him out. But if such an affair didn’t befall, then, nevertheless, there would be some such thing as could never befall anybody else: either he would become so tipsy at the buffet that he would be able to do nothing but laugh, or else he would lie such a blue streak that he himself would become conscience-stricken. And he would tell a pack of lies utterly without any need for it: he would suddenly relate that he had a horse with some kind of blue hide, or pink, and suchlike poppycock, so that his auditors would, to a man, walk away from him at last, saying: “Well, brother, it seems you’ve started pulling the long bow!” There are certain folk who have a low-down passion for playing some vile trick on their fellow man, at times without any earthly reason for it. One, for instance, a man who has even attained high rank, with a noble appearance, with a Star gracing his bosom, will be clasping your hand as he discusses with you profound subjects which call for meditative reflection; yet later on, right on the spot, you look, and before your very eyes he will pull some vile stunt at your expense and will pull it in such a way as a common Collegiate Registrar might, and not at all in the way a man with a Star gracing his bosom would who discusses subjects that call for serious reflection, so that you can but stand there and wonder, shrugging your shoulders, and there isn’t a thing else on earth you can do. Just such a strange passion did Nozdrev have. The more intimate anybody became with him, the more willingly would Nozdrev put the skids under him, of all people; he would spread some wild tale, so silly that it would be difficult to think up a sillier to top it; he would break up a marriage or a business deal, yet would not at all consider himself your enemy; on the contrary, if chance ever led him to meet you again, he would treat you anew as a close friend and would even say: “Why, you’re such a low-down fellow, you never drop in on me!” Nozdrev, in many respects, was a many-sided man—that is, he was ready to try his hand at anything. In the same breath he would propose to go with you wherever you wished—to the end of the world, even— would propose entering with you on any enterprise you like, swapping everything in the world for anything you like. A gun, a dog, a horse, anything could form the basis for a swap, but not at all in order to gain something: the swap was undertaken only from some sort of turbulently indefatigable impetuosity and liveliness of character. If, at a fair, he had the good luck of coming upon a simpleton and trimming him, he would buy up a mountain of whatever things happened to meet his eye first in the shops: horse collars, incense pastilles, neckerchiefs for the nurse, a stallion, raisins, a silver washbasin, Holland linen, farina, tobacco, pistols, herrings, pictures, a turning lathe, pots, boots, faience dishes—as long as his money lasted. However, it but rarely happened that these things reached home: almost the same day they would be lost to some other, luckier gamester; at times even his own pipe, with tobacco pouch and an extra amber mouthpiece, would be thrown in and, on occasion, his whole team of four horses and everything that went with it—not only calash but the coachman as well—so that the master himself would have to set out in an abbreviated, wretched frock coat or a short Tatar kaftan to seek out some friend of his to get a lift home in his vehicle. That’s the sort of fellow Nozdrev was! Perhaps people will call him a hackneyed character, will start saying that there is no Nozdrev in existence nowadays. Alas, those who are going to say such things will be unjust. Nozdrev will not die off this earth for a long time yet. He is everywhere in our midst, perhaps merely walking about in a coat of a different cut; but men are frivolously unperceptive and a fellow in a coat of a different cut will look to them like an entirely different fellow."

"Заметив, что закуска была готова, полицеймейстер предложил гостям окончить вист после завтрака, и все пошли в ту комнату, откуда несшийся запах давно начинал приятным образом щекотать ноздри гостей и куда уже Собакевич давно заглядывал в дверь, наметив издали осетра, лежавшего в стороне на большом блюде. Гости, выпивши по рюмке водки темного оливкового цвета, какой бывает только на сибирских прозрачных камнях, из которых режут на Руси печати, приступили со всех сторон с вилками к столу и стали обнаруживать, как говорится, каждый свой характер и склонности, налегая кто на икру, кто на семгу, кто на сыр. Собакевич, оставив без всякого внимания все эти мелочи, пристроился к осетру, и, покамест те пили, разговаривали и ели, он в четверть часа с небольшим доехал его всего, так что когда полицеймейстер вспомнил было о нем и, сказавши: «А каково вам, господа покажется вот это произведенье природы?» — подошел было к нему с вилкою вместе с другими, то увидел, что от произведенья природы оставался всего один хвост; а Собакевич пришипился так, как будто и не он, и, подошедши к тарелке, которая была подальше прочих, тыкал вилкою в какую-то сушеную маленькую рыбку. Отделавши осетра, Собакевич сел в кресла и уж более не ел, не пил, а только жмурил и хлопал глазами. Полицеймейстер, кажется, не любил жалеть вина; тостам не было числа. Первый тост был выпит, как читатели, может быть, и сами догадаются, за здоровье нового херсонского помещика, потом за благоденствие крестьян его и счастливое их переселение, потом за здоровье будущей жены его, красавицы, что сорвало приятную улыбку с уст нашего героя. Приступили к нему со всех сторон и стали упрашивать убедительно остаться хоть на две недели в городе:","Noticing that the appetizer was ready, the police chief suggested that the guests finish their whist after breakfast, and they all went into that room, from where the wafting smell had long begun to pleasantly tickle the nostrils of the guests, and where Sobakevich had long peered through the door, outlining from a distance a sturgeon lying to the side on a large platter. The guests, having drunk a glass of vodka of a dark olive color, which happens only on Siberian transparent stones, from which seals are cut in Russia, proceeded from all sides with forks to the table and began to reveal, as they say, each of his character and inclinations, leaning some on caviar , some for salmon, some for cheese. Sobakevich, leaving all these trifles without any attention, attached himself to the sturgeon, and while they drank, talked and ate, he drove it all in a little over a quarter of an hour, so that when the police chief remembered him and, saying: “And how are you , gentlemen, this work of nature will seem? - approached him with a fork along with others, then he saw that only one tail remained from the product of nature; and Sobakevich hissed as if it were not him, and, going up to the plate, which was far away from the others, he poked with a fork at some kind of dried little fish. Having finished the sturgeon, Sobakevich sat down in an armchair and no longer ate or drank, but only screwed up his eyes and blinked. The police chief did not seem to like to spare wine; there were no toasts. The first toast was drunk, as readers, perhaps, will guess for themselves, to the health of the new Kherson landowner, then to the prosperity of his peasants and their happy resettlement, then to the health of his future wife, a beauty, which tore a pleasant smile from the lips of our hero. They approached him from all sides and began to beg convincingly to stay at least for two weeks in the city:","Observing that the savouries were ready, the police-master suggested that they should finish their game after lunch, and they all trooped into the room, the smell issuing from which had begun some time previously to tickle their noses agreeably, and in at the door of which Sobakevitch had for some time been peeping, having noted from a distance the sturgeon lying on a big dish. After drinking a glass of a dark vodka, of that olive colour which is only seen in the transparent Siberian stones of which seals are carved in Russia, the guests approached the table from all sides, with forks in their hands and began to display, as the saying is, each his character and propensities, one falling on the caviare, another on the dried salmon, another on the cheese. Sobakevitch, paying no attention to all these trifles, established himself by the sturgeon, and while the others were drinking, talking and eating, he in a little over a quarter of an hour had made his way through it, so that when the police-master recollected it, and saying: “And what do you think, gentlemen, of this product of nature?” went up, fork in hand, with others of the company towards it, he saw that nothing was left of the product of nature but its tail, while Sobakevitch effaced himself, and as though it were not his doing, went up to a dish at a little distance from the rest, and stuck his fork into some little dried fish. Having had enough with the sturgeon, Sobakevitch sat down in an easy-chair, ate and drank nothing more; he simply frowned and blinked. The police-master was apparently not given to sparing the wine; the toasts were innumerable. The first toast was, as the reader can probably guess for himself, drunk to the health of the new Kherson landowner, then to the prosperity of his peasants and their successful settlement in their new home, then to the health of that fair lady, his future bride, which elicited an agreeable smile from our hero. The company surrounded him on all sides and began earnestly pleading with him to remain with them, if only for another fortnight: “Come, Pavel Ivanovitch!","On perceiving the feast to be ready, the host proposed that his guests should finish their whist after luncheon; whereupon all proceeded to the room whence for some time past an agreeable odour had been tickling the nostrils of those present, and towards the door of which Sobakevitch in particular had been glancing since the moment when he had caught sight of a huge sturgeon reposing on the sideboard. After a glassful of warm, olive-coloured vodka apiece—vodka of the tint to be seen only in the species of Siberian stone whereof seals are cut—the company applied themselves to knife-and-fork work, and, in so doing, evinced their several characteristics and tastes. For instance, Sobakevitch, disdaining lesser trifles, tackled the large sturgeon, and, during the time that his fellow guests were eating minor comestibles, and drinking and talking, contrived to consume more than a quarter of the whole fish; so that, on the host remembering the creature, and, with fork in hand, leading the way in its direction and saying, “What, gentlemen, think you of this striking product of nature?” there ensued the discovery that of the said product of nature there remained little beyond the tail, while Sobakevitch, with an air as though at least HE had not eaten it, was engaged in plunging his fork into a much more diminutive piece of fish which happened to be resting on an adjacent platter. After his divorce from the sturgeon, Sobakevitch ate and drank no more, but sat frowning and blinking in an armchair. Apparently the host was not a man who believed in sparing the wine, for the toasts drunk were innumerable. The first toast (as the reader may guess) was quaffed to the health of the new landowner of Kherson; the second to the prosperity of his peasants and their safe transferment; and the third to the beauty of his future wife—a compliment which brought to our hero’s lips a flickering smile. Lastly, he received from the company a pressing, as well as an unanimous, invitation to extend his stay in town for at least another fortnight, and, in the meanwhile, to allow a wife to be found for him.","Noticing that the hors d’oeuvres were ready, the police chief suggested that his guests finish their whist after lunch, and everyone went into the other room, the smell wafting from which had long ago begun pleasantly to tickle the nostrils of the guests, and into which Sobakevich had long been peeking through the door, aiming from afar at the sturgeon that lay to one side on a big platter. The guests, having drunk a glass of vodka of the dark olive color that occurs only in those transparent Siberian stones from which seals are carved in Russia, accosted the table from all sides with forks and began to reveal, as they say, each his own character and inclinations, applying themselves one to the caviar, another to the salmon, another to the cheese. Sobakevich, letting all these trifles go unnoticed, stationed himself by the sturgeon, and while the others were drinking, talking, and eating, he, in a little over a quarter of an hour, went right through it, so that when the police chief remembered about it, and with the words: “And what, gentlemen, do you think of this work of nature?” approached it, fork in hand, along with the others, he saw that the only thing left of this work of nature was the tail; and Sobakevich scrooched down as if it was not him, and, coming to a plate some distance away, poked his fork into some little dried fish. After polishing off the sturgeon, Sobakevich sat in an armchair and no longer ate or drank, but only squinted and blinked his eyes. The police chief, it seemed, did not like to stint on wine; the toasts were innumerable. The first toast was drunk, as our readers might guess for themselves, to the health of the new Kherson landowner, then to the prosperity of his peasants and their happy resettlement, then to the health of his future wife, a beauty, which drew a pleasant smile from our hero’s lips. They accosted him on all sides and began begging him insistently to stay in town for at least two weeks:","Perceiving that the snack was ready, the Chief of Police proposed to his guests that they suspend their whist for a bite, and they all trooped into the room, the aromas from which had long since been pleasantly titillating the nostrils of the guests and into which Sobakevich had long been peeping, having marked from afar a sturgeon placed to one side, on a big platter. The guests, having each drained a glass of vodka of a dark, olivine hue—such a hue as is to be found only on certain transparent stones from Siberia, which in Russia are graven into seals—armed themselves with forks and attacked the table from all sides, each one, as they say, revealing his nature and his leanings, this one coming down hard on the caviar, that one assaulting the smoked salmon, still another tackling the cheese. Sobakevich, paying no attention to all these trifles, settled down to work on the sturgeon he had had his eye on and, while the others were drinking, chatting, and eating, he, in just a little more than a quarter of an hour, finished it all off, so that when the Chief of Police did recall it, saying: “And how will this work of nature strike you, gentlemen?” and had walked up to it with the others, fork in hand, he saw that there was but an inedible tail left of this work of nature. As for Sobakevich, he grew very quiet as if this hadn’t been his work at all, and, having withdrawn as far as possible from the others, was prodding his fork into a plate of some sort of small, dried fish. Having put away the exceptional sturgeon, Sobakevich settled down in an easy chair and no longer ate or drank another thing, but merely puckered and blinked his eyes. The Chief of Police evidently was not fond of sparing potables—there was no counting the toasts. The first toast was drunk, as our readers may even have surmised for themselves, to the health of the new landowner from Kherson; then came one to the well-being of his serfs and their happy resettlement, then another to the health of his future wife (naturally a great beauty), which evoked a pleasant smile from the lips of our hero. They surrounded him on all sides and began imploring him most convincingly to stay on in their town for at least two more weeks: “No, Pavel Ivanovich!"

"Гости воротились тою же гадкою дорогою к дому. Ноздрев повел их в свой кабинет, в котором, впрочем, не было заметно следов того, что бывает в кабинетах, то есть книг или бумаги; висели только сабли и два ружья — одно в триста, а другое в восемьсот рублей. Зять, осмотревши, покачал только головою. Потом были показаны турецкие кинжалы, на одном из которых по ошибке было вырезано: «Мастер Савелий Сибиряков». Вслед за тем показалась гостям шарманка. Ноздрев тут же провертел пред ними кое-что. Шарманка играла не без приятности, но в средине ее, кажется, что-то случилось, ибо мазурка оканчивалась песнею: «Мальбруг в поход поехал», а «Мальбруг в поход поехал» неожиданно завершался каким-то давно знакомым вальсом. Уже Ноздрев давно перестал вертеть, но в шарманке была одна дудка очень бойкая, никак не хотевшая угомониться, и долго еще потому свистела она одна. Потом показались трубки — деревянные, глиняные, пенковые, обкуренные и необкуренные, обтянутые замшею и необтянутые, чубук с янтарным мундштуком, недавно выигранный, кисет, вышитый какою-то графинею, где-то на почтовой станции влюбившеюся в него по уши, у которой ручки, по словам его, были самой субдительной сюперфлю, — слово, вероятно означавшее у него высочайшую точку совершенства. Закусивши балыком, они сели за стол близ пяти часов. Обед, как видно, не составлял у Ноздрева главного в жизни; блюда не играли большой роли: кое-что и пригорело, кое-что и вовсе не сварилось. Видно, что повар руководствовался более каким-то вдохновеньем и клал первое, что попадалось под руку: стоял ли возле него перец — он сыпал перец, капуста ли попалась — совал капусту, пичкал молоко, ветчину, горох — словом, катай-валяй, было бы горячо, а вкус какой-нибудь, верно, выйдет. Зато Ноздрев налег на вина: еще не подавали супа, он уже налил гостям по большому стакану портвейна и по другому госотерна, потому что в губернских и уездных городах не бывает простого сотерна. Потому Ноздрев велел принести бутылку мадеры, лучше которой не пивал сам фельдмаршал. Мадера, точно, даже горела во рту, ибо купцы, зная уже вкус помещиков, любивших добрую мадеру, заправляли ее беспощадно ромом, а иной раз вливали туда и царской водки, в надежде, что всё вынесут русские желудки. Потом Ноздрев велел еще принесть какую-то особенную бутылку, которая, по словам его, была и бургоньон и шампаньон вместе. Он наливал очень усердно в оба стакана, и направо и налево, и зятю и Чичикову; Чичиков заметил, однако же, как-то вскользь, что самому себе он не много прибавлял. Это заставило его быть осторожным, и как только Ноздрев как-нибудь заговаривался или наливал зятю, он опрокидывал в ту же минуту свой стакан в тарелку. В непродолжительном времени была принесена на стол рябиновка, имевшая, по словам Ноздрева, совершенный вкус сливок, но в которой, к изумлению, слышна была сивушища во всей своей силе. Потом пили какой-то бальзам, носивший такое имя, которое даже трудно было припомнить, да и сам хозяин в другой раз назвал его уже другим именем. Обед давно уже кончился, и вина были перепробованы, но гости всё еще сидели за столом. Чичиков никак не хотел заговорить с Ноздревым при зяте насчет главного предмета. Все-таки зять был человек посторонний, а предмет требовал уединенного и дружеского разговора. Впрочем, зять вряд ли мог быть человеком опасным, потому что нагрузился, кажется, вдоволь и, сидя на стуле, ежеминутно клевался носом. Заметив и сам, что находился не в надежном состоянии, он стал наконец отпрашиваться домой, но таким ленивым и вялым голосом, как будто бы, по русскому выражению, натаскивал клещами на лошадь хомут.","The guests returned by the same nasty path to the house. Nozdryov led them to his office, in which, however, there were no noticeable traces of what happens in offices, that is, books or paper; only sabers and two guns hung - one worth three hundred and the other eight hundred rubles. The brother-in-law, having looked around, shook his head only. Then Turkish daggers were shown, on one of which was mistakenly carved: ""Master Savely Sibiryakov."" After that, a hurdy-gurdy appeared to the guests. Nozdryov immediately turned something over in front of them. The hurdy-gurdy played not without pleasantness, but in the middle of it, it seems, something happened, for the mazurka ended with the song: ""Mahlbrug went on a campaign,"" and ""Malbrug went on a campaign"" unexpectedly ended with some long-familiar waltz. Nozdryov had long ceased to twirl, but there was only one very lively pipe in the hurdy-gurdy, which in no way wanted to calm down, and for that reason it whistled alone for a long time. Then pipes appeared - wooden, clay, meerschaum, stoned and unsmoked, covered with suede and not covered, a shank with an amber mouthpiece, recently won, a pouch embroidered by some countess, who, somewhere at the post station, fell head over heels in love with him, with which handles , according to him, were the most sublime superflue, a word that probably meant with him the highest point of perfection. Having had a bite of salmon, they sat down at the table about five o'clock. Dinner, apparently, was not the main thing in Nozdryov's life; the dishes did not play a big role: some burned, some did not cook at all. It can be seen that the cook was guided by some kind of inspiration and put the first thing that came to hand: if there was a pepper near him - he poured pepper, if he caught cabbage - he popped cabbage, stuffed milk, ham, peas - in a word, go ahead, it was would be hot, but some taste, right, will come out. On the other hand, Nozdryov leaned heavily on wine: soup had not yet been served, he had already poured out a large glass of port wine for the guests and, in a different way, state sourtern, because in provincial and district cities there is no simple sautern. Therefore, Nozdryov ordered to bring a bottle of Madeira, better than which the field marshal himself did not drink. Madeira, for sure, even burned in the mouth, for the merchants, already knowing the taste of the landowners who loved good Madeira, mercilessly filled it with rum, and sometimes poured aqua regia into it, in the hope that Russian stomachs would endure everything. Then Nozdryov also ordered that some special bottle be brought, which, according to him, was both bourgognon and champagne together. He poured very diligently into both glasses, right and left, both for his son-in-law and for Chichikov; Chichikov noticed, however, somehow casually, that he did not add much to himself. This forced him to be careful, and as soon as Nozdryov somehow spoke or poured for his son-in-law, he immediately knocked over his glass into a plate. In a short time, rowanberry was brought to the table, which, according to Nozdryov, had the perfect taste of cream, but in which, to amazement, fusel was heard in all its strength. Then they drank some kind of balm, which bore a name that was even difficult to remember, and the owner himself on another occasion called it by a different name. Dinner was long over, and the wines had been tasted, but the guests were still sitting at the table. Chichikov did not want to speak to Nozdryov in front of his son-in-law about the main subject. Still, the son-in-law was an outsider, and the subject required a solitary and friendly conversation. However, the son-in-law could hardly be a dangerous person, because he loaded himself, it seems, to his heart's content and, sitting on a chair, every minute nodding. Noticing himself that he was not in a reliable condition, he finally began to ask for leave to go home, but in such a lazy and sluggish voice, as if, in a Russian expression, he was pulling a collar on a horse with tongs.","The visitors returned to the house by the same disgusting road. Nozdryov led them to his study, in which however there was nothing commonly seen in studies, such as books or papers; on the walls there hung swords and two guns, one that had cost three hundred and the other eight hundred roubles. The brother-in-law after examining them merely shook his head. Then they were shown some Turkish daggers, on one of which there had been engraved by mistake: Made by Savely Sibiryakov. Then the friends were shown a barrel-organ. Nozdryov immediately turned the handle. The barrel-organ played not unpleasantly, but something seemed to go wrong with it in the middle, for the mazurka ended up with the song, “Marlbrook s‘en va-t-en guerre,”ar and Marlbrook wound up unexpectedly with an old familiar waltz. Nozdryov had left off turning, but there was one pipe in the organ that was very irrepressible and, unwilling to be silenced, went on for a long time fluting by itself. Then they were shown pipes made of wood, of clay, or of meerschaum, smoked and unsmoked, wrapped up in chamois leather and not wrapped up, a chiboukas with an amber mouthpiece lately won at cards, a tobacco pouch embroidered by a countess who had fallen head over ears in love with him somewhere at a posting station, and whose hands were, in his words, subtilement superflues,at words that apparently to him suggested the acme of perfection. After a preliminary snack of salt sturgeon they sat down to dinner about five o‘clock. Dinner evidently was not the chief interest in Nozdryov’s life; the dishes did not make a very fine show, some were burnt, others quite uncooked. It was evident the cook was guided by inspiration and put in the first ingredient he laid his hand on, if the pepper happened to stand by him he put in pepper, if cabbage turned up, in it went, he flung in milk, ham, peas— in short he pitched in everything pell-mell so long as it was hot, thinking it would be sure to have some sort of taste. On the other hand Nozdryov was strong on wines; even before the soup was handed round he had already poured out for each of his guests a big glass of port and another of Haut Sauterne,au for in provincial towns there is no such thing as simple Sauterne. Then Nozdryov sent for a bottle of Madeira, “no field-marshal ever drank better,” he said. The Madeiraav certainly did burn their mouths, for the wine merchants know the tastes of country gentlemen who are fond of good Madeira, and doctor it mercilessly with rum and sometimes put plain vodka in it, confidently relying on the fortitude of the Russian stomach. Then Nozdryov ordered a special bottle to be fetched of a wine which, according to him, was a mixture of Burgundy and champagne. He poured it very freely into the glasses of both—to right and to left, to his brother-in-law and Tchitchikov. Tchitchikov noticed, however, out of the corner of his eye that his host took very little for himself. This put him on his guard, and as soon as Nozdryov’s attention was distracted by talking or pouring out wine for his brother-in-law he upset his wine-glass into his plate. After a brief interval a liqueur made from rowan berries was put on the table and described by Nozdryov as tasting exactly like cream, though to their surprise it tasted strongly of corn-brandy. Then they drank some sort of balsam which had a name difficult to remember, and, indeed, the master of the house called it by a different name later on. The dinner had long ago been finished and all the wines tasted, but the guests still sat at the table. Tchitchikov was not at all anxious to broach the great subject to Nozdryov before the brother-in-law: the latter was in any case a third person and the subject called for privacy and friendly talk. At the same time the brother-in-law could hardly be a man to be afraid of, for he was apparently quite tipsy and was nod ding in his chair. Perceiving himself that he was in a somewhat unstable condition, he began to talk of going home, but in a voice as languid and listless as though, to use the Russian expression, he were putting on a horse’s collar with a pair of pincers.","The guests returned by the same route as that by which they had come; whereafter, on reaching the house, Nozdrev conducted them to his study, which contained not a trace of the things usually to be found in such apartments—such things as books and papers. On the contrary, the only articles to be seen were a sword and a brace of guns—the one “of them worth three hundred roubles,” and the other “about eight hundred.” The brother-in-law inspected the articles in question, and then shook his head as before. Next, the visitors were shown some “real Turkish” daggers, of which one bore the inadvertent inscription, “Saveli Sibiriakov 19, Master Cutler.” Then came a barrel-organ, on which Nozdrev started to play some tune or another. For a while the sounds were not wholly unpleasing, but suddenly something seemed to go wrong, for a mazurka started, to be followed by “Marlborough has gone to the war,” and to this, again, there succeeded an antiquated waltz. Also, long after Nozdrev had ceased to turn the handle, one particularly shrill-pitched pipe which had, throughout, refused to harmonise with the rest kept up a protracted whistling on its own account. Then followed an exhibition of tobacco pipes—pipes of clay, of wood, of meerschaum, pipes smoked and non-smoked; pipes wrapped in chamois leather and not so wrapped; an amber-mounted hookah (a stake won at cards) and a tobacco pouch (worked, it was alleged, by some countess who had fallen in love with Nozdrev at a posthouse, and whose handiwork Nozdrev averred to constitute the “sublimity of superfluity”—a term which, in the Nozdrevian vocabulary, purported to signify the acme of perfection). Finally, after some hors-d’oeuvres of sturgeon’s back, they sat down to table—the time being then nearly five o’clock. But the meal did not constitute by any means the best of which Chichikov had ever partaken, seeing that some of the dishes were overcooked, and others were scarcely cooked at all. Evidently their compounder had trusted chiefly to inspiration—she had laid hold of the first thing which had happened to come to hand. For instance, had pepper represented the nearest article within reach, she had added pepper wholesale. Had a cabbage chanced to be so encountered, she had pressed it also into the service. And the same with milk, bacon, and peas. In short, her rule seemed to have been “Make a hot dish of some sort, and some sort of taste will result.” For the rest, Nozdrev drew heavily upon the wine. Even before the soup had been served, he had poured out for each guest a bumper of port and another of “haut” sauterne. (Never in provincial towns is ordinary, vulgar sauterne even procurable.) Next, he called for a bottle of madeira—“as fine a tipple as ever a field-marshall drank”; but the madeira only burnt the mouth, since the dealers, familiar with the taste of our landed gentry (who love “good” madeira) invariably doctor the stuff with copious dashes of rum and Imperial vodka, in the hope that Russian stomachs will thus be enabled to carry off the lot. After this bottle Nozdrev called for another and “a very special” brand—a brand which he declared to consist of a blend of burgundy and champagne, and of which he poured generous measures into the glasses of Chichikov and the brother-in-law as they sat to right and left of him. But since Chichikov noticed that, after doing so, he added only a scanty modicum of the mixture to his own tumbler, our hero determined to be cautious, and therefore took advantage of a moment when Nozdrev had again plunged into conversation and was yet a third time engaged in refilling his brother-in-law’s glass, to contrive to upset his (Chichikov’s) glass over his plate. In time there came also to table a tart of mountain-ashberries—berries which the host declared to equal, in taste, ripe plums, but which, curiously enough, smacked more of corn brandy. Next, the company consumed a sort of pasty of which the precise name has escaped me, but which the host rendered differently even on the second occasion of its being mentioned. The meal over, and the whole tale of wines tried, the guests still retained their seats—a circumstance which embarrassed Chichikov, seeing that he had no mind to propound his pet scheme in the presence of Nozdrev’s brother-in-law, who was a complete stranger to him. No, that subject called for amicable and PRIVATE conversation. Nevertheless, the brother-in-law appeared to bode little danger, seeing that he had taken on board a full cargo, and was now engaged in doing nothing of a more menacing nature than picking his nose. At length he himself noticed that he was not altogether in a responsible condition; wherefore he rose and began to make excuses for departing homewards, though in a tone so drowsy and lethargic that, to quote the Russian proverb, he might almost have been “pulling a collar on to a horse by the clasps.”","The guests returned over the same nasty route to the house. Nozdryov led them to his study, in which, however, there was no trace to be seen of what is usually found in studies, that is, books or papers; there hung only sabers and two guns—one worth three hundred and the other eight hundred roubles. The in-law, having examined them, merely shook his head. Then they were shown some Turkish daggers, on one of which there had been mistakenly engraved: Savely Sibiryakov, Cutler. After that, a barrel organ appeared before the guests. Nozdryov straightaway ground something out for them. The barrel organ played not unpleasantly, but something seemed to have happened inside it, for the mazurka ended with the song “Malbrough Went Off to War,”15 and “Malbrough Went Off to War” was unexpectedly concluded by some long-familiar waltz. Nozdryov had long stopped grinding, but there was one very perky reed in the organ that simply refused to quiet down, and for some time afterwards went on tooting all by itself. Then pipes appeared—of wood, clay, meerschaum, broken in and un-broken-in, covered with chamois and not covered, a chibouk with an amber mouthpiece recently won at cards, a tobacco pouch embroidered by some countess who had fallen head over heels in love with him somewhere at a posting station, whose hands, according to him, were most subdiminally superflu—a phrase that for him probably meant the peak of perfection. After a snack of balyk, they sat down to eat at around five o’clock. Dinner, obviously, did not constitute the main thing in Nozdryov’s life; the dishes did not play a big role: some were burnt, some were totally underdone. It was obvious that the cook was guided more by some sort of inspiration and put in the first thing he laid his hands on: if pepper was standing there, he poured in pepper; if there happened to be cabbage, he stuck in cabbage; he threw in milk, ham, peas—in short, slapdash, as long as it was hot, and some sort of taste was bound to result. Instead, Nozdryov applied himself to the wines: the soup had not yet been served, and he had already poured his guests a big glass of port, and another of ho-sauterne,16 because in provincial and district capitals plain sauterne is not to be found. Then Nozdryov called for a bottle of madeira, than which no field marshal ever tasted better. The madeira, indeed, even burned the mouth, for the merchants, knowing the taste of landowners who like fine madeira, doctored it unmercifully with rum, and sometimes even poured aqua regia into it, in hopes that the Russian stomach could endure anything. Then Nozdryov called for some special bottle which, according to him, was burgognon and champagnon in one. He poured very zealously into both glasses, to his right and to his left, for his inlaw and for Chichikov. Chichikov noticed, however, somehow by the way, that he did not pour much for himself. This put him on his guard, and as soon as Nozdryov got somehow distracted, talking or pouring for his in-law, he would at once empty his glass onto his plate. After a short while, a rowanberry liqueur was brought to the table, which, according to Nozdryov, tasted altogether like cream, but which, amazingly, gave off a potent smell of moonshine. They then drank some sort of cordial, which had a name that was even difficult to remember, and which the host himself next time called by some different name. Dinner had long been over, and the wines had all been tried, but the guests were still sitting at the table. Chichikov by no means wanted to begin talking with Nozdryov about the main subject in the inlaw’s presence. After all, the in-law was a third party, and the subject called for private and friendly conversation. However, the in-law could hardly be a dangerous man, because he seemed to have gotten fairly loaded, and kept nodding as he sat in his chair. Noticing himself that he was in rather unreliable condition, he finally started asking to go home, but in such a lazy and languid voice as though he were, as the Russian saying goes, pulling a collar on a horse with a pair of pliers.","The visitors returned by the same vile route to the house. Nozdrev led them off to his study, in which, however, there were not to be found any traces of that which is usual to studies—books and papers, that is; all they saw there in the way of adornment were some swords and two guns— one of the latter had cost three hundred rubles and the other eight hundred. Nozdrev’s brother-in-law, having looked them over, merely shook his head. After that the host exhibited to them genuine Turkish daggers— one of which, however, through some error, was engraved with “Made by Savelii Sibiriakov.” Following this a hurdy-gurdy was exhibited to the guests. Nozdrev, right then and there, ground out a thing or two for them. The hurdy-gurdy played not unpleasingly but, apparently, something must have happened to its innards, inasmuch as a mazurka wound up with “Malbrouk to the Wars Has Gone,” while “Malbrouk to the Wars Has Gone” was unexpectedly terminated by some long-familiar waltz. Nozdrev had long since quit grinding, but the hurdy-gurdy had one particularly lively reed that would not quiet down, and for a while thereafter it kept tootling of its own accord. Then came the exhibition of the pipes: of brier, of clay, of meerschaum, broken-in and new, in chamois purses and without chamois purses, a chibouk with a mouthpiece of amber, recently won at play, a tobacco pouch embroidered by a certain countess who, at some stage post or other, had fallen head over heels in love with him and whose tiny hands, according to his words, were the most subtle superflues—a word that, for him, probably signified the very acme of perfection. Having had a snack of salted sturgeon, they sat down at the table about five. The dinner table, evidently, did not constitute for Nozdrev the main thing in life; the courses did not play a great role in the dinner; this dish and that had even become burnt; this dish and that had not even been thoroughly cooked. It was evident that the chef was guided for the most part by some weird inspiration and would pop into the pot the first things that came to his hand; if the pepper pot happened to be standing near by, he would sprinkle in the pepper; if cabbage came handy, he would shove in the cabbage; he slopped in milk, ham, peas—in short, slap, dash, as long as it was hot, and as for the taste, well, some sort of taste would probably come out in the end. But to make up for all that, Nozdrev leant heavily on wine: even before soup was served he had poured out for each guest a large glass of port, and another of haut sauternes, inasmuch as in provincial capitals and district towns there is no such thing to be found as ordinary sauternes. Next Nozdrev ordered a bottle of Madeira to be brought, “and not even the field marshal himself has ever drunk a better.” The Madeira, to be sure, actually burned ones mouth, inasmuch as the wine merchants, knowing well by now the taste of the landed proprietors who were fond of good Madeira, hocused it unmercifully with rum, and on occasion even poured into it Tsar’s vodka, trusting that Russian stomachs would stand anything and everything.3 Then Nozdrev also ordered a certain particular bottle to be fetched which, according to his own unorthodox terminology, was both a bourgognion and a cham-pagnion rolled into one. He was most zealous in pouring the drink into the glasses to his right and left, both into Chichikov’s and into his brother-in-law’s; Chichikov happened to notice, however, that he did not add a great deal to his own glass. This compelled him to be cautious, and, as soon as Nozdrev would happen to become absorbed in talk or would be filling up his brother-in-law’s glass, Chichikov would at that instant tip his glass over into his plate. After a brief interval, a cordial made from rowan berries was brought in and placed on the table, which cordial, according to Nozdrev’s words, tasted exactly like cream, but in which, amazingly enough, one could perceive moonshine in all its potency. Then they drank some balsam or other, which bore a name that was hard to remember, and even the host himself gave it another name when he had occasion to mention it a second time. The dinner had long since ended and all the wines had already been tasted, yet the guests still sat on at the table. Chichikov under no circumstances wished to broach his main object to Nozdrev in the presence of his brother-in-law; after all, his brother-in-law was an outsider, whereas the object demanded a private and friendly talk. However, Nozdrev’s brother-in-law could hardly have been regarded as a person to feel apprehensive about, inasmuch as he had, apparently, taken on a sufficient load and, seated in his chair, kept going off to sleep every minute or so. Perceiving himself that he was in a rather precarious state, he began, at last, begging to go home, but in such a drawling and listless voice as if, according to the Russian expression, he were putting a collar on a horse with a pair of pincers."
"Генерал смутился. Собирая слова и мысли, стал он говорить, хотя несколько несвязно, что слово ты было им сказано не в том смысле, что старику иной раз позволительно сказать молодому человеку ты (о чине своем он не упомянул ни слова).","The general was confused. Collecting words and thoughts, he began to say, although somewhat incoherently, that the word you was not spoken by him in the sense that it is sometimes permissible for an old man to say you to a young man (he did not mention a word about his rank).","“ The general was abashed. Collecting his thoughts he began to say, though rather incoherently, that he had not meant it in that sense, that it is sometimes permissible for an old man to address a young man in that informal way (he did not make the faintest allusion to his rank).","The General sat aghast. At length, rallying his tongue and his faculties, he replied that, though he had spoken with a lack of ceremony, he had used the term “thou” merely as an elderly man naturally employs it towards a junior (he made no reference to difference of rank).","The general was embarrassed. Collecting his words and thoughts, he began to say, albeit somewhat incoherently, that the familiarity had not been used in that sense, that it was sometimes permissible for an old man to address a young one in such fashion (he did not mention a word about his rank).",

"Чичиков оскорбился таким замечанием. Уже всякое выражение, сколько-нибудь грубое или оскорбляющее благопристойность, было ему неприятно. Он даже не любил допускать с собой ни в каком случае фамильярного обращения, разве только если особа была слишком высокого звания.

"— Еду я, — сказал Чичиков, потирая себе рукой по колену, в сопровожденье легкого покачиванья всего туловища и наклоняя голову набок, — не столько по своей нужде, сколько по нужде другого. Генерал Бетрищев, близкий приятель и, можно сказать, благотворитель, просил навестить родственников. Родственники, конечно, родственниками, но отчасти, так сказать, и для самого себя, ибо, — не говоря уже о пользе в геморроидальном отношении, — видеть свет и коловращенье людей — есть уже само по себе, так сказать, живая книга и вторая наука.","""I'm going,"" Chichikov said, rubbing his hand on his knee, accompanied by a slight swaying of his whole body and tilting his head to one side, ""not so much for my own need, but for the need of another. General Betrishchev, a close friend and, one might say, a philanthropist, asked to visit his relatives. Relatives, of course, relatives, but partly, so to speak, also for oneself, because, not to mention the benefits in the hemorrhoidal relation, to see the light and the gyration of people is in itself, so to speak, a living book and a second science. .","“I am going,” said Tchitchikov, rubbing his knee with his hand, while he gently swayed his whole person and leaned his head affably on one side, “not so much on my own affairs as on other people’s. General Betrishtchev, my intimate friend, and I may say benefactor, asked me to visit his relations. Relations of course are relations, but in a sense I am going for my own sake too—since apart from the advantages from the point of view of digestion—to see the world and what people are doing is, so to say, the book of life and a second education....”","By the way, to what part of the country, and to what places, are you thinking of travelling?” “To tell the truth,” replied Chichikov, rocking himself to and fro on the bench, and smoothing his knee with his hand, and gently inclining his head, “I am travelling less on my own affairs than on the affairs of others. That is to say, General Betristchev, an intimate friend, and, I might add, a generous benefactor of mine, has charged me with commissions to some of his relatives. Nevertheless, though relatives are relatives, I may say that I am travelling on my own account as well, in that, in addition to possible benefit to my health, I desire to see the world and the whirligig of humanity, which constitute, to so speak, a living book, a second course of education.”","“I’m going,” said Chichikov, rubbing his knee with his hand to accompany the slight rocking of his whole body and inclining his head to one side, “not so much on my own necessity as on another man’s.

Relatives, of course, are relatives, but it is partly, so to speak, for my own sake as well, for—to say nothing of the benefit in the hemorrhoidal respect—to see the world and the circulation of people—is already in itself, so to speak, a living book and a second education.”",

"Но вдруг на место прежнего тюфяка был прислан новый начальник, человек военный, строгий, враг взяточников и всего, что зовется неправдой. На другой же день пугнул он всех до одного, потребовал отчеты, увидел недочеты, на каждом шагу недостающие суммы, заметил в ту же минуту дома красивой гражданской архитектуры, и пошла переборка. Чиновники были отставлены от должности; дома гражданской архитектуры поступили в казну и обращены были на разные богоугодные заведения и школы для кантонистов, все распушено было в пух, и Чичиков более других. Лицо его вдруг, несмотря на приятность, не понравилось начальнику, почему именно, бог ведает, — иногда даже просто не бывает на это причин, — и он возненавидел его насмерть. И грозен был сильно для всех неумолимый начальник. Но так как все же он был человек военный, стало быть, не знал всех тонкостей гражданских проделок, то чрез несколько времени, посредством правдивой наружности и уменья подделаться во всему, втерлись к нему в милость другие чиновники, и генерал скоро очутился в руках еще больших мошенников, которых он вовсе не почитал такими; даже был доволен, что выбрал наконец людей как следует, и хвастался не в шутку тонким уменьем различать способности. Чиновники вдруг постигнули дух его и характер. Все, что ни было под начальством его, сделалось страшными гонителями неправды; везде, во всех делах они преследовали ее, как рыбак острогой преследует какую-нибудь мясистую белугу, и преследовали ее с таким успехом, что в скором времени у каждого очутилось по нескольку тысяч капиталу. В это время обратились на путь истины многие из прежних чиновников и были вновь приняты на службу. Но Чичиков уж никаким образом не мог втереться, как ни старался и как стоял за него подстрекнутый письмами князя Хованского первый генеральский секретарь, постигнувший совершенно управленье генеральским носом, но тут он ничего решительно не мог сделать. Генерал был такого рода человек, которого хотя и водили за нос (впрочем, без его ведома), но зато уже, если в голову ему западала какая-нибудь мысль, то она там была все равно что железный гвоздь: ничем нельзя было ее оттуда вытеребить. Все, что мог сделать умный секретарь, было уничтоженье запачканного послужного списка, и на то уже он подвинул начальника не иначе, как состраданием, изобразив ему в живых красках трогательную судьбу несчастного семейства Чичикова, которого, к счастию, у него не было.","But suddenly a new boss was sent in place of the former mattress, a military man, strict, an enemy of bribe-takers and everything that is called untruth. The very next day he frightened everyone to one, demanded reports, saw shortcomings, missing sums at every step, noticed at the same moment houses of beautiful civil architecture, and a bulkhead began. Officials were removed from office; houses of civil architecture went to the treasury and were turned to various charitable institutions and schools for cantonists, everything was fluffed up, and Chichikov more than others. His face suddenly, in spite of his pleasantness, did not please the boss, why exactly, God knows - sometimes there is simply no reason for it - and he hated him to death. And the inexorable boss was very formidable for everyone. But since he was nevertheless a military man, and therefore did not know all the intricacies of civil tricks, after a while, by means of a truthful appearance and the ability to fake everything, other officials rubbed into his favor, and the general soon found himself in the hands of even greater swindlers, whom he did not at all regard as such; he was even pleased that at last he had chosen people properly, and he boasted in earnest of his subtle ability to distinguish between abilities. Officials suddenly comprehended his spirit and character. Everything that was under his command became terrible persecutors of iniquity; everywhere, in all cases, they pursued her, as a spear fisherman pursues some fleshy beluga, and they pursued her with such success that soon everyone found themselves with several thousand capital. At this time, many of the former officials turned to the path of truth and were again taken to the service. But Chichikov could not in any way infiltrate himself, no matter how hard he tried and how much the first general secretary, incited by the letters of Prince Khovansky, who had completely mastered the control of the general's nose, stood for him, but here he could not do anything decisively. The General was the kind of person who, although led by the nose (however, without his knowledge), but on the other hand, if any thought got into his head, then it was there just like an iron nail: nothing could have pulled it out of there. . All that the clever secretary could do was to destroy the soiled track record, and for that he already moved the boss only with compassion, depicting to him in vivid colors the touching fate of the unfortunate Chichikov family, which, fortunately, he did not have.","But all at once a new chief, a stern military man, the enemy of bribe-takers and of everything that is called injustice, was sent to replace the easy-going old fogey who had been in command. The next day he frightened every one of them, he called for accounts, detected inaccuracies and sums of money missing at every step, instantly noticed the handsome private residences and a severe inquiry followed. Officials were dismissed from their posts. The handsome private residences passed to the Treasury and were transformed into almshouses and schools for the sons of soldiers—everything was scattered to the winds and Tchitchikov suffered more than the others. The new chief suddenly—God only knows why, sometimes indeed it happens for no reason—took a dislike to his face in spite of its pleasantness, and conceived a mortal hatred for him. And the relentless chief was a terrible menace to every one. But as he was a military man and so did not understand all the subtleties of civilian strategy, within a short time another set of officials succeeded in worming themselves into his favour, thanks to an appearance of honesty and a capacity for pleasing, and the general soon found himself in the hands of still greater scoundrels, though he did not recognise them as such; he was even delighted that he had at last picked out the right men and even boasted of his keen powers of discriminating character. The officials instantly grasped his temper and character. Everything that was under his command was carried on by men who fiercely tracked down every delinquency; everywhere, in every case, they hunted it as a fisherman hunts some fat white salmon with a harpoon, and they hunted it with such success, that in a short time every one of them had saved up several thousands of roubles. Then many of the former officials returned to the paths of righteousness and were received into the service. But Tchitchikov could not worm his way in again anyhow, though the general’s chief secretary, who completely led his chief by the nose, encouraged by Prince Hovansky’s letters, espoused his cause and did his utmost, yet he could do nothing for him whatever. Though the general could be led by the nose (without being aware of it of course), yet if an idea once got into his head it was like an iron nail , there was no pulling it out again. All the intelligent secretary could obtain was the destruction of the record of his ignominy, and he only obtained this by appealing to the general’s compassion, and painting in vivid colours the touching plight of the delinquent’s children, though Tchitchikov fortunately had none.","But suddenly there appeared upon the scene a new Director—a military man, and a martinet as regarded his hostility to bribe-takers and anything which might be called irregular. On the very day after his arrival he struck fear into every breast by calling for accounts, discovering hosts of deficits and missing sums, and directing his attention to the aforesaid fine houses of civilian architecture. Upon that there ensued a complete reshuffling. Tchinovniks were retired wholesale, and the houses were sequestrated to the Government, or else converted into various pious institutions and schools for soldiers’ children. Thus the whole fabric, and especially Chichikov, came crashing to the ground. Particularly did our hero’s agreeable face displease the new Director. Why that was so it is impossible to say, but frequently, in cases of the kind, no reason exists. However, the Director conceived a mortal dislike to him, and also extended that enmity to the whole of Chichikov’s colleagues. But inasmuch as the said Director was a military man, he was not fully acquainted with the myriad subtleties of the civilian mind; wherefore it was not long before, by dint of maintaining a discreet exterior, added to a faculty for humouring all and sundry, a fresh gang of tchinovniks succeeded in restoring him to mildness, and the General found himself in the hands of greater thieves than before, but thieves whom he did not even suspect, seeing that he believed himself to have selected men fit and proper, and even ventured to boast of possessing a keen eye for talent. In a trice the tchinovniks concerned appraised his spirit and character; with the result that the entire sphere over which he ruled became an agency for the detection of irregularities. Everywhere, and in every case, were those irregularities pursued as a fisherman pursues a fat sturgeon with a gaff; and to such an extent did the sport prove successful that almost in no time each participator in the hunt was seen to be in possession of several thousand roubles of capital. Upon that a large number of the former band of tchinovniks also became converted to paths of rectitude, and were allowed to re-enter the Service; but not by hook or by crook could Chichikov worm his way back, even though, incited thereto by sundry items of paper currency, the General’s first secretary and principal bear leader did all he could on our hero’s behalf. It seemed that the General was the kind of man who, though easily led by the nose (provided it was done without his knowledge) no sooner got an idea into his head than it stuck there like a nail, and could not possibly be extracted; and all that the wily secretary succeeded in procuring was the tearing up of a certain dirty fragment of paper—even that being effected only by an appeal to the General’s compassion, on the score of the unhappy fate which, otherwise, would befall Chichikov’s wife and children (who, luckily, had no existence in fact).","But suddenly, to replace the former old doormat, a new superior was sent, a military man, strict, the enemy of bribe takers and of everything known as falsehood. The very next day he threw a scare into one and all, demanded the accounts, found missing amounts, sums omitted at every step, noticed straight off the houses of beautiful civil architecture, and the sorting out began. The officials were dismissed from their posts; the houses of civil architecture were made government property and turned into various almshouses and schools for cantonists;59 everywhere the feathers flew, and with Chichikov more than the rest. Despite its agreeableness, the superior suddenly took a dislike to his face, God knows why exactly—sometimes it is even simply for no reason at all—and conceived a mortal hatred for him. And to everyone this implacable superior was a great terror. But since he was anyhow a military man, and consequently did not know all the subtleties of civilian capers, in a short time certain other officials wormed their way into his graces, by means of a truthful appearance and a skill in ingratiating themselves with everyone, and the general soon wound up in the hands of still greater crooks, whom he by no means regarded as such; he was even pleased that he had finally made a proper choice of people, and seriously boasted of his fine skill in discerning abilities. The officials suddenly comprehended his spirit and character. All that were under his command became terrible persecutors of falsehood; everywhere, in all things, they pursued it as a fisherman with a harpoon pursues some meaty sturgeon, and they pursued it so successfully that in a short while each of them turned out to have several thousand in capital. At that time many of the former officials returned to the right way and were taken back into the service. But Chichikov simply could not worm his way in, despite all the efforts of the general’s first secretary to stand up for him, instigated by letters from Prince Khovansky, for though he comprehended perfectly the art of directing the general’s nose, in this case he could do decidedly nothing. The general was the kind of man who, while he could be led by the nose (though without his knowing it), yet if some thought lodged itself in his head, it was the same as an iron nail: there was no way of getting it out. All that the clever secretary managed to do was to have the tarnished service record destroyed, and he moved the superior to that only by compassion, portraying for him in vivid colors the touching plight of Chichikov’s unfortunate family, which he, fortunately, did not have.","But suddenly, to replace the doormat of a man who had hitherto been in power, a new chief executive was sent on; a military man, stern, a foe to all bribetakers and of all that is called wrongdoing. The very next day he threw a scare into every last one of those under him: he demanded accounts, perceived discrepancies therein, coming upon shortages at every step; it did not take him more than a minute to notice the houses of handsome metropolitan architecture—and the shake-up was on. Officials were removed from their posts; the houses of metropolitan architecture went to the Treasury and were turned into various charitable institutions and schools for soldiers’ sons; the well-feathered nests were scattered to the four winds, and Chichikov’s more so than any of the others. His face, despite its amiability, suddenly proved not to the liking of the chief—just why, God alone knows: at times there just aren’t any reasons for such things—and he conceived a mortal hatred for Chichikov. And the implacable new chief was a mighty terror unto them all. But since he was, after all, a military man, and consequently not wise to all the refinements of civilian chicanery, it followed that after some time, thanks to their appearance of righteousness and their ability to simulate and assimilate, other officials wormed themselves into his good graces, and the General in a short while found himself in the hands of still bigger swindlers whom he did not at all consider to be such; he was actually satisfied because he had, at last, chosen the proper men and boasted in all seriousness of his exceptional ability to discern capable people. It didn’t take at all long for the officials to catch on to his temperament and character. All who were under his supervision became, with never an exception, awesome persecutors of wrongdoing; everywhere, in all matters, did they pursue it, even as a fisherman with a harpoon pursues some fleshy white sturgeon, and pursued it with such success that in a short while each one of them turned out to have a nest egg of a few thousands. It was at this time that many of the former officials turned to the path of righteousness and were taken back into the service. But Chichikov no longer could, in any way, worm his way in, no matter how the General’s head secretary, who had attained utter mastery in leading the General by the nose, exerted himself and stood up for him, urged on by certain notes signed by none other than the Minister of Finance himself; in this matter he could accomplish absolutely nothing. The General, true enough, was the sort of man who could be led about by his nose (without his knowing he was thus led, however), but, to make up for that, once he got any idea into his head it was fixed there once and for all, like a nail driven home flush, and there was no such thing as prying it out. All that the clever secretary was able to accomplish was to do away with the blot upon Chichikov’s service record, and he could move his chief to agree to this in no other way than through appealing to his compassion, depicting for him in lively colors the touching plight of Chichikov’s unhappy family, which, fortunately, Chichikov did not have."
"Чичиков великодушно расплатился с портным и, оставшись один, стал рассматривать себя на досуге в зеркале, как артист с эстетическим чувством и con amore.[45] Оказалось, что все как-то было еще лучше, чем прежде: щечки интереснее, подбородок заманчивей, белые воротнички давали тон щеке, атласный синий галстук давал тон воротничкам; новомодные складки манишки давали тон галстуку, богатый бархатный жилет давал тон манишке, а фрак наваринского дыма с пламенем, блистая, как шелк, давал тон всему. Поворотился направо — хорошо! Поворотился налево — еще лучше! Перегиб такой, как у камергера или у такого господина, который так чешет по-французски, что перед ним сам француз ничего, который, даже и рассердись, не срамит себя непристойно русским словом, даже и выбраниться не умеет на русском языке, а распечет французским диалектом. Деликатность такая! Он попробовал, склоня голову несколько набок, принять позу, как бы адресовался к даме средних лет и последнего просвещения: выходила просто картина. Художник, бери кисть и пиши! В удовольствии, он совершил тут же легкий прыжок, вроде антраша. Вздрогнул комод и шлепнулась на землю склянка с одеколоном; но это не причинило никакого помешательства. Он назвал, как и следовало, глупую склянку дурой и подумал: «К кому теперь прежде всего явиться? Всего лучше…»","Chichikov generously paid off the tailor and, left alone, began to examine himself at his leisure in the mirror, as an artist with an aesthetic sense and con amore.[45] It turned out that everything was somehow even better than before: the cheeks were more interesting, the chin more attractive, the white collars gave tone to the cheek, the satin blue tie gave tone to the collars; the new-fashioned folds of the shirt-front gave tone to the cravat, the rich velvet waistcoat gave tone to the shirt-front, and the coat of Navarino smoke with flames, shining like silk, gave tone to everything. Turned to the right - good! Turned to the left - even better! The inflection is such as that of a chamberlain or such a gentleman who scratches in French so much that the Frenchman himself is nothing in front of him, who, even when angry, will not shame himself with an obscene Russian word, even does not know how to get out in Russian, but will scribble in French dialect. Such delicacy! He tried, bowing his head somewhat to one side, to take a pose, as if addressing a lady of middle age and the last enlightenment: just a picture came out. Artist, take a brush and write! In pleasure, he immediately made a light jump, like an entreche. The chest of drawers shuddered and a bottle of cologne flopped to the ground; but it did not cause any insanity. He called, as he should have done, the stupid bottle a fool and thought: “Who should I come to first of all now? The best…”","Tchitchikov paid the tailor with magnanimous liberality, and left alone, began scrutinising himself at his leisure in the looking-glass with the eye of an artist, with aesthetic emotion and con amore.eu It seemed to make everything even better than before: his cheeks looked more interesting, his chin more alluring, the white collar gave a tone to the cheeks , the dark-blue satin cravat gave a tone to the collar; the new-fashioned fold of the shirt-front gave a tone to the cravat, the rich velvet waistcoat gave a tone to the shirt-front, and the coat of the “smoke and flame of Navarino,” shimmering like silk, gave a tone to everything. He turned to the right—it was good! He turned to the left—that was better still! He had the figure of a kam merherr,evor of an attaché on a foreign diplomatic mission, or of a gentleman who speaks French so beautifully that a Frenchman is nothing to him, and who even in a rage never demeans himself with a Russian word, but swears in French. Such refinement! Putting his head a little on one side he tried to assume the attitude in which he would address a lady of middle age, and of the most modern culture: it made a perfect picture. Painter, take a brush and paint him! In his delight he cut a little caper after the fashion of an entrechat. The chest of drawers shook and a bottle of eau-de-cologne fell on the floor; but this did not trouble him in the least. He very naturally called the bottle a silly thing, and began wondering: “To whom shall I pay my first visit? The best of all ...”","Chichikov graciously settled the man’s account, and, as soon as he had gone, paraded at leisure, and con amore, and after the manner of an artist of aesthetic taste, before the mirror. Somehow he seemed to look better than ever in the suit, for his cheeks had now taken on a still more interesting air, and his chin an added seductiveness, while his white collar lent tone to his neck, the blue satin tie heightened the effect of the collar, the fashionable dickey set off the tie, the rich satin waistcoat emphasised the dickey, and the smoked-grey-shot-with-flame-colour frockcoat, shining like silk, splendidly rounded off the whole. When he turned to the right he looked well: when he turned to the left he looked even better. In short, it was a costume worthy of a Lord Chamberlain or the species of dandy who shrinks from swearing in the Russian language, but amply relieves his feelings in the language of France. Next, inclining his head slightly to one side, our hero endeavoured to pose as though he were addressing a middle-aged lady of exquisite refinement; and the result of these efforts was a picture which any artist might have yearned to portray. Next, his delight led him gracefully to execute a hop in ballet fashion, so that the wardrobe trembled and a bottle of eau-de-Cologne came crashing to the floor. Yet even this contretemps did not upset him; he merely called the offending bottle a fool, and then debated whom first he should visit in his attractive guise.","Chichikov magnanimously paid the tailor and, left alone, began to examine himself at leisure in the mirror, like an artist, with aesthetic feeling and con amore. It turned out that everything was somehow even better than before: the little cheeks were more interesting, the chin more alluring, the white collar imparted its color to the cheek, the blue satin tie imparted its hue to the collar; the shirtfront, pleated in the latest fashion, imparted its hue to the tie, the rich velvet waistcoat imparted its hue to the shirtfront, and the tailcoat of the flames and smoke of Navarino, gleaming like silk, imparted its hue to everything! He turned to the right—good! He turned to the left—even better! The curve of the waist was like a courtier’s or such a gentleman’s as jabbers away in French so that next to him a Frenchman himself is nothing, one who, even when angry, does not disgrace himself indecently with a Russian word, who cannot even swear in Russian, but will give you a good scolding in French dialect. Such delicacy! He tried, inclining his head slightly to one side, to assume a pose as if he were addressing a middle-aged lady of the latest cultivation: it was a picture to see. Painter, take up your brush and paint! In his pleasure, he straightaway performed a light leap, like an entrechat. The chest of drawers shook and a flask of eau de cologne fell to the ground; but this caused no hindrance. He quite properly called the stupid flask a fool, and thought: “Whom shall I visit first of all? The best …”",
"Приказчик явился. Это был человек лет под сорок, бривший бороду, ходивший в сюртуке и, по-видимому, проводивший очень покойную жизнь, потому что лицо его глядело какою-то пухлою полнотою, а желтоватый цвет кожи и маленькие глаза показывали, что он знал слишком хорошо, что такое пуховики и перины. Можно было видеть тотчас, что он совершил свое поприще, как совершают его все господские приказчики: был прежде просто грамотным мальчишкой в доме, потом женился на какой-нибудь Агашке-ключнице, барыниной фаворитке, сделался сам ключником, а там и приказчиком. А сделавшись приказчиком, поступал, разумеется, как все приказчики: водился и кумился с теми, которые на деревне были побогаче, подбавлял на тягла[3] победнее, проснувшись в девятом часу утра, поджидал самовара и пил чай.","The clerk has arrived. He was a man of about forty, who shaved his beard, walked in a frock coat, and, apparently, led a very quiet life, because his face looked like some kind of plump fullness, and the yellowish skin color and small eyes showed that he knew too well, what are down jackets and feather beds. It could be seen at once that he had completed his career, as all the master's clerks do it: before that he was just a literate boy in the house, then he married some Agashka the housekeeper, a mistress's favorite, became a housekeeper himself, and then a clerk. And having become a clerk, he acted, of course, like all clerks: he hung out and mingled with those who were richer in the village, added to the taxes [3] poorer, waking up at nine o'clock in the morning, waiting for the samovar and drinking tea.","The steward appeared. He was a man about forty who shaved his beard, wore a frock-coat and apparently led a very easy life, for his face looked plump and puffy, and the yellow complexion and little eyes betrayed that he was not a stranger to feather beds and pillows. It could be seen at once that he had made his way in life as all gentlemen’s stewards do: he had once been simply a boy in the household who could read and write, then had married some Agashka, a housekeeper and favourite of the mistress, had himself become keeper of the stores and then steward. And, having become a steward, he behaved, of course, like all stewards; he hob-nobbed with those who were richer in the village and added to the burdens of the poorer; when he woke after eight o‘clock in the morning he waited for the samovar and drank his tea before he went out.","Before long the bailiff made his appearance. He was a man of under forty, clean-shaven, clad in a smock, and evidently used to a quiet life, seeing that his face was of that puffy fullness, and the skin encircling his slit-like eyes was of that sallow tint, which shows that the owner of those features is well acquainted with a feather bed. In a trice it could be seen that he had played his part in life as all such bailiffs do—that, originally a young serf of elementary education, he had married some Agashka of a housekeeper or a mistress’s favourite, and then himself become housekeeper, and, subsequently, bailiff; after which he had proceeded according to the rules of his tribe—that is to say, he had consorted with and stood in with the more well-to-do serfs on the estate, and added the poorer ones to the list of forced payers of obrok, while himself leaving his bed at nine o’clock in the morning, and, when the samovar had been brought, drinking his tea at leisure.","The steward appeared. He was a man approaching forty, who shaved his beard, wore a frock coat, and apparently led a very comfortable life, because his face had about it the look of a certain puffy plumpness, and his little eyes and the yellowish tint of his skin showed that he knew all too well what goose down and feather beds were. One could see at once that he had made his way in life as all estate stewards do: had first been simply a literate boy about the house, then married some housekeeper Agashka, the mistress’s favorite, became a housekeeper himself, and then steward. And having become steward, he behaved, naturally, like all stewards: hobnobbed with villagers of the wealthier sort; put additional taxes on the poorer ones; woke up past eight in the morning, waited for the samovar, and drank his tea.","The steward appeared. He was a man of near forty, clean-shaven and used to wearing a frock coat and, apparently, one who led a tranquil existence, inasmuch as his face had a sort of puffily full look, while the yellowish tinge of his skin and his little eyes indicated that he knew only too well what downy comforters and feather beds were like. One could see right off that he had gone through his career much the same as all seigno-rial stewards do: he had been formerly simply a lad about the house who knew how to read and write; then had married some Agashka, a housekeeper who was her mistress’s favorite; had become a manager in his own turn and, after that, actually the steward. And having become steward he acted, of course, as all stewards do: he hobnobbed with and cultivated the friendship of those folk in the village who were better off and added to the burdens of those of the poorer sort; he awoke when the morning was going on nine and then took it easy till the samovar came and he had his tea."
"А Чичиков в довольном расположении духа сидел в своей бричке, катившейся давно по столбовой дороге. Из предыдущей главы уже видно, в чем состоял главный предмет его вкуса и склонностей, а потому не диво, что он скоро погрузился весь в него и телом и душою. Предположения, сметы и соображения, блуждавшие по лицу его, видно, были очень приятны, ибо ежеминутно оставляли после себя следы довольной усмешки. Занятый ими, он не обращал никакого внимания на то, как его кучер, довольный приемом дворовых людей Манилова, делал весьма дельные замечания чубарому пристяжному коню, запряженному с правой стороны. Этот чубарый конь был сильно лукав и показывал только для вида, будто бы везет, тогда как коренной гнедой и пристяжной каурой масти, называвшийся Заседателем, потому что был приобретен от какого-то заседателя, трудился от всего сердца, так что даже в глазах их было заметно получаемое ими от того удовольствие. «Хитри, хитри! вот я тебя перехитрю! — говорил Селифан, приподнявшись и хлыснув кнутом ленивца. — Ты знай свое дело, панталонник ты немецкий! Гнедой — почтенный конь, он сполняет свой долг, я ему с охотою дам лишнюю меру, потому что он почтенный конь, и Заседатель тож хороший конь… Ну, ну! что потряхиваешь ушами? Ты, дурак, слушай, коли говорят! я тебя, невежа, не стану дурному учить. Ишь куда ползет!» Здесь он опять хлыснул его кнутом, примолвив; «У, варвар! Бонапарт ты проклятый!» Потом прикрикнул на всех: «Эй вы, любезные!» — и стегнул по всем по трем уже не в виде наказания, но чтобы показать, что был ими доволен. Доставив такое удовольствие, он опять обратил речь к чубарому: «Ты думаешь, что скроешь свое поведение. Нет, ты живи по правде, когда хочешь, чтобы тебе оказывали почтение. Вот у помещика, что мы были, хорошие люди. Я с удовольствием поговорю, коли хороший человек; с человеком хорошим мы всегда свои други, тонкие приятели; выпить ли чаю, или закусить — с охотою, коли хороший человек. Хорошему человеку всякой отдаст почтение. Вот барина нашего всякой уважает, потому что он, слышь ты, сполнял службу государскую, он сколеской советник…»","And Chichikov, in a contented frame of mind, was sitting in his britzka, which had been rolling along the high road for a long time. From the previous chapter it is already clear what was the main object of his taste and inclinations, and therefore it is not surprising that he soon immersed himself completely in it, both in body and soul. The assumptions, estimates and considerations that wandered over his face were evidently very pleasant, for every minute they left behind traces of a contented smile. Occupied by them, he did not pay any attention to how his coachman, pleased with the reception of Manilov's courtyard people, made very sensible remarks to the shaggy harness horse harnessed on the right side. This gray-haired horse was very cunning and showed only for the sake of appearances, as if he was lucky, while the native bay and harness coat of color, called the Assessor, because he was acquired from some assessor, worked with all his heart, so that even in their eyes there was noticeably the pleasure they derive from it. ""Cunning, cunning! Here I'll outwit you! said Selifan, rising and whipping the sloth. - You know your business, pantaloon you are German! The bay is a respectable horse, he does his duty, I will gladly give him an extra measure, because he is a respectable horse, and the Assessor is also a good horse ... Well, well! what are you shaking your ears? You fool, listen when they say! I will not teach you ignorant things. Look where it's crawling!"" Here he again whipped him with a whip, saying; ""Oh, barbarian! Bonaparte you damned! Then he shouted at everyone: “Hey you, dear ones!” - and lashed at all three, no longer as a punishment, but to show that he was pleased with them. Having delivered such pleasure, he again turned his speech to the chubarom: “You think that you will hide your behavior. No, you live by the truth when you want to be honored. Here is the landowner that we were, good people. I'll be happy to talk if a good person; with a good person we are always our friends, subtle buddies; whether to drink tea or have a snack - willingly, if a good person. Everyone will give respect to a good person. Here everyone respects our gentleman, because, you hear, he performed the state service, he is a scole adviser ... ""","Meanwhile Tchitchikov in a contented frame of mind was sitting in his chaise which had for some time been rolling along the high-road. From the foregoing chapter it can now be seen what was the chief subject of his interests and inclinations, and so it is not surprising that he was soon completely absorbed in it. The suppositions, calculations, and reflections of which signs passed over his face were evidently very agreeable, for at every moment traces of a gratified smile were left by them. Engrossed in them, he paid no attention to the fact that his coachman, well-satisfied with the reception given him by Manilov’s servants, was making very sagacious observations to the dappled trace -horseab harnessed on the right side. This dappled grey horse was extremely sly and only made a show of pulling, while the bay in the shafts and the other trace-horse, of a chestnut colour and called the Assessor because it had been purchased from some tax assessor, worked with all their hearts, so that the satisfaction they derived from it was actually perceptible in their eyes. “Be as sly as you like! I’ll be even with you!” said Selifan, rising in his seat and lashing the laggard with his whip. “You mind your job, you German pantaloon! The bay is a gentlemanly horse, he does his duty; I’ll be glad to give him an extra handful, for he is a gentlemanly horse, and the Assessor, he is a good horse too.... Now then, why are you shaking your ears? You should listen when you are spoken to, you fool! I am not going to teach you any harm, you dunce. There, where is he off to?” Here he lashed him, observing: “Ugh, you savage! you damned Bonaparte! ...” Then he shouted at all of them: “Hey, you darlings!” And he gave a flick to all three, not by way of punishment but to show that he was pleased with them. After having gratified himself in this way he again addressed the dappled trace-horse: “You think you will hide your conduct. No, you must act straightforwardly, if you want to be treated with respect. At that landowner’s now where we have been there are good folks. I am always glad to talk to a good man; a good man and I can always get on together, we are always close friends. Whether it’s drinking a cup of tea with anybody or taking a snack of something, I do it with a relish if he’s a good man. Every one pays respect to a good man. Here’s our master now, every one respects him because he has served his Tsar, do you hear, he is a collegiate councillor ...”","Meanwhile, Chichikov, seated in his britchka and bowling along the turnpike, was feeling greatly pleased with himself. From the preceding chapter the reader will have gathered the principal subject of his bent and inclinations: wherefore it is no matter for wonder that his body and his soul had ended by becoming wholly immersed therein. To all appearances the thoughts, the calculations, and the projects which were now reflected in his face partook of a pleasant nature, since momentarily they kept leaving behind them a satisfied smile. Indeed, so engrossed was he that he never noticed that his coachman, elated with the hospitality of Manilov’s domestics, was making remarks of a didactic nature to the off horse of the troika 11, a skewbald. This skewbald was a knowing animal, and made only a show of pulling; whereas its comrades, the middle horse (a bay, and known as the Assessor, owing to his having been acquired from a gentleman of that rank) and the near horse (a roan), would do their work gallantly, and even evince in their eyes the pleasure which they derived from their exertions. “Ah, you rascal, you rascal! I’ll get the better of you!” ejaculated Selifan as he sat up and gave the lazy one a cut with his whip. “YOU know your business all right, you German pantaloon! The bay is a good fellow, and does his duty, and I will give him a bit over his feed, for he is a horse to be respected; and the Assessor too is a good horse. But what are YOU shaking your ears for? You are a fool, so just mind when you’re spoken to. ‘ Tis good advice I’m giving you, you blockhead. Ah! You CAN travel when you like.” And he gave the animal another cut, and then shouted to the trio, “Gee up, my beauties!” and drew his whip gently across the backs of the skewbald’s comrades—not as a punishment, but as a sign of his approval. That done, he addressed himself to the skewbald again. “Do you think,” he cried, “that I don’t see what you are doing? You can behave quite decently when you like, and make a man respect you.” With that he fell to recalling certain reminiscences. “They were NICE folk, those folk at the gentleman’s yonder,” he mused. “I DO love a chat with a man when he is a good sort. With a man of that kind I am always hail-fellow-well-met, and glad to drink a glass of tea with him, or to eat a biscuit. One CAN’T help respecting a decent fellow. For instance, this gentleman of mine—why, every one looks up to him, for he has been in the Government’s service, and is a Collegiate Councillor.”","And Chichikov in a contented state of mind was sitting in his britzka, which had long been rolling down the high road. From the previous chapter it will already be clear what constituted the chief subject of his taste and inclinations, and therefore it is no wonder that he was soon immersed in it body and soul. The speculations, estimates, and considerations that wandered over his face were, apparently, very agreeable, for at every moment they left behind them traces of a contented smile. Occupied with them, he paid not the slightest attention to his coachman, who, content with his reception by Manilov’s household serfs, was making most sensible observations to the dappled gray outrunner harnessed on the right side. This dappled gray horse was extremely sly and only made a show of pulling, while the bay shaft horse and the chestnut outrunner, who was called Assessor because he had been acquired from some assessor, put their whole hearts into it, so that the satisfaction they derived from it could even be read in their eyes. “Fox away, fox away! I’ll still outfox you!” Selifan said, rising a little and lashing the lazybones with his whip. “To learn you your business, you German pantaloon! The bay’s a respectable horse, he does his duty, and I’ll gladly give him an extra measure, because he’s a respectable horse, and Assessor’s a good horse, too … Well, well, why are you twitching your ears? Listen to what you’re told, fool! I won’t learn you anything bad, you lout! Look at him crawling!” Here he lashed him again with the whip, adding: “Ooh, barbarian! Cursed Bonaparte!” Then he yelled at all of them: “Hup, my gentles!” and whipped all three of them, not with a view to punishment this time, but to show he was pleased with them. Having given them this pleasure, he again addressed his speech to the dapple-gray: “You think you can hide your behavior. No, you must live by the truth, if you want to be shown respect. At that landowner’s now, where we were, they were good people. It’s a pleasure for me to talk, if it’s with a good man; with a good man I’m always friends, fine companions: whether it’s having tea, or a bite to eat—I’m game, if it’s with a good man. To a good man everybody shows respect. Our master, now, everybody honors him, because he was in the goverman’s service, he’s a scollegiate councillor …”","Chichikov, in the meantime, in a spirit of contentment, lolled in his carriage, which had long since been tooling along a highroad. From the preceding chapter it is apparent by now what constituted the main object of his taste and inclinations, and therefore it is little to be wondered at if in a short while he surrendered thereto, body and soul. The projects, calculations, and schemes, indications of which strayed over his face, must have been most pleasant, evidently, inasmuch as at every moment they left their traces in a contented smile. Absorbed in them, he paid no attention whatsoever to the fact that his coachman, who was likewise gratified with the reception he had received from Manilov’s domestics, was making quite sound observations to the piebald trace-horse on the right. This piebald horse was powerful sly and was merely putting on a show of pulling his load, whereas the shaft-horse, a sorrel with black mane and tail, and the other trace-horse, a light chestnut in color, who was called Assessor because he had been acquired from some tax assessor or other, put all their hearts into their work, so that one could actually note in their eyes the pleasure they derived therefrom.1 “Keep on with your smart tricks, just keep right on! But watch out I don’t outsmart you!” Selifan was saying, rising a little and giving the sluggard a taste of his whip. “Just keep your mind on your work, you German pants-maker! You take the sorrel horse, there’s a horse to look up to; he does his duty; I’ll give him an extra measure of oats right willingly, because he is a horse you can look up to; and Assessor, now, he’s a good horse, too. . . . There you go, there you go —what are you twitching your ears for? You just listen, you fool, when someone’s talking to you! I ain’t a-goin’ to teach you nothin’ bad, you ignoramus! Look at where he’s goin’!” Here he again gave him a taste of his whip, adding, “Ugh, you barbarian, you! You damned Boneyparte, you!” Then he shouted at all three: “Hey, there, my darlings!” and flicked all three, no longer as a form of chastisement, but just to show them that he was satisfied with them. Having given them that pleasure, he again turned his lecture upon the dappled horse: “You’ve got a notion you can hide from me the way you’re carrying on. Oh, no, you ve got to live accordin’ to the ways of righteousness if you mean to be looked up to. There, over at the squires where we were just now, the people are a fine lot. I take pleasure in conversing, if there’s some fine person to converse with; I’m always good friends with a fine person—right friendly; whether it comes to drinking a dish of tea or having a snack, I’m right willing, if it be with a fine person. Everybody looks up to a fine person. There, our master is looked up to everywhere because he—do you hear me?—done his duty in serving the government, he’s a big wheel, a Collidjit Councilor, he is—”"

"Перед ним стояла не одна губернаторша: она держала под руку молоденькую шестнадцатилетнюю девушку, свеженькую блондинку с тоненькими и стройными чертами лица, с остреньким подбородком, с очаровательно круглившимся овалом лица, какое художник взял бы в образец для мадонны и какое только редким случаем попадается на Руси, где любит все оказаться в широком размере, всё что ни есть: и горы и леса и степи, и лица и губы и ноги; ту самую блондинку, которую он встретил на дороге, ехавши от Ноздрева, когда, по глупости кучеров или лошадей, их экипажи так странно столкнулись, перепутавшись упряжью, и дядя Митяй с дядею Миняем взялись распутывать дело. Чичиков так смешался, что не мог произнести ни одного толкового слова, и пробормотал черт знает что такое, чего бы уж никак не сказал ни Гремин, ни Зяонский, ни Лидин.","Before him stood more than one governor: she held by the arm a young sixteen-year-old girl, a fresh blonde with thin and slender features, with a pointed chin, with a charmingly rounded oval face, which an artist would take as a model for a Madonna and which only a rare case comes across in Russia , where everything likes to be in a wide size, everything that is: mountains and forests and steppes, and faces and lips and legs; the same blonde whom he met on the road, driving from Nozdryov, when, due to the stupidity of the coachmen or horses, their carriages collided so strangely, having mixed up the harness, and Uncle Mityai and Uncle Minyay undertook to unravel the matter. Chichikov was so confused that he could not utter a single sensible word, and muttered the devil knows what it was, something neither Gremin, nor Zyaonsky, nor Lidin would have said.","It was not the governor’s wife alone who stood before him; on her arm was a fresh-looking fair-haired girl of sixteen, with delicate and graceful features, a pointed chin, and a face of an enchantingly rounded oval, such as an artist might have taken as a model for his Madonna, and such as is rarely seen in Russia, where everything, whatever it may be, is apt to be on a broad scale: mountains, forests, steppes, faces, lips, and feet. It was the same fair-haired girl whom he had met on his way back from Nozdryov’s when through the stupidity of the coachman or the horses, their carriages had come so strangely into collision, when their harness was entangled and Uncle Mitya and Uncle Minyay undertook to extricate them. Tchitchikov was so overcome that he could utter nothing coherent, and goodness knows what he mumbled, something that certainly no Gremin, Zvonsky or Lidin would have said.","Before him there was standing not only Madame, but also a young girl whom she was holding by the hand. The golden hair, the fine-drawn, delicate contours, the face with its bewitching oval—a face which might have served as a model for the countenance of the Madonna, since it was of a type rarely to be met with in Russia, where nearly everything, from plains to human feet, is, rather, on the gigantic scale; these features, I say, were those of the identical maiden whom Chichikov had encountered on the road when he had been fleeing from Nozdrev’s. His emotion was such that he could not formulate a single intelligible syllable; he could merely murmur the devil only knows what, though certainly nothing of the kind which would have risen to the lips of the hero of a fashionable novel.","Before him stood not only the governor’s wife: on her arm she had a young girl of sixteen, a fresh blonde with fine and trim features, a sharp chin, a charmingly rounded face, the sort an artist would choose as a model for a Madonna, a sort rarely occurring in Russia, where everything likes to be on a vast scale, whatever there is—mountains and forests and steppes, and faces and lips and feet; the same blonde he had met on the road, leaving Nozdryov’s, when, owing to the stupidity either of the coachmen or of the horses, their carriages had so strangely collided, entangling their harnesses, and Uncle Mityai and Uncle Minyai had set about disentangling the affair. Chichikov was so abashed that he was unable to utter a single sensible word and mumbled devil knows what, something no Gremin or Zvonsky or Lidin would ever have said.","It was not only the Governor’s lady who was standing before him; she was holding by the hand a young girl of sixteen, a fresh little blonde with fine and regular features, with a sharp little chin; her whole face a bewitchingly rounded-out oval, such as an artist would have taken for his Madonna and which one but rarely comes upon in Russia, where all things like to evince themselves on a sweeping scale—all things, with no exception: the mountains, and the forests, and the steppes, and faces, and lips, and feet. It was the very same blonde whom he had met on the road while traveling from Nozdrev ’s, when through the stupidity of the coachmen or the horses their vehicles had so oddly collided, their harnesses tangling together, and Uncle Mitiai together with Uncle Miniai had undertaken the task of disentangling them. Chichikov became so confused that he was unable to bring out a single sensible word and mumbled the Devil knows what, but something which neither a Gremin nor a Zvonskii nor a Lidin would ever have said under any circumstances."

"Чичиков перечокался со всеми. «Нет, нет, еще!» — говорили те, которые были позадорнее, и вновь перечокались; потом полезли в третий раз чокаться, перечокались и в третий раз. В непродолжительное время всем сделалось весело необыкновенно. Председатель, который был премилый человек, когда развеселялся, обнимал несколько раз Чичикова, произнеся в излиянии сердечном: «Душа ты моя! маменька моя!» — и даже, щелкнув пальцами, пошел приплясывать вокруг него, припевая известную песню: «Ах ты такой и этакой камаринский мужик». После шампанского раскупорили венгерское, которое придало еще более духу и развеселило общество. Об висте решительно позабыли; спорили, кричали, говорили обо всем: об политике, об военном даже деле, излагали вольные мысли, за которые в другое время сами бы высекли своих детей. Решили тут же множество самых затруднительных вопросов. Чичиков никогда не чувствовал себя в таком веселом расположении, воображал себя уже настоящим херсонским помещиком, говорил об разных улучшениях: о трехпольном хозяйстве, о счастии и блаженстве двух душ, и стал читать Собакевичу послание в стихах Вертера к Шарлотте, на которое тот хлопал только глазами, сидя в креслах, ибо после осетра чувствовал большой позыв ко сну. Чичиков смекнул и сам, что начал уже слишком развязываться, попросил экипажа и воспользовался прокурорскими дрожками. Прокурорский кучер, как оказалось в дороге, был малый опытный, потому что правил одной только рукой, а другую засунув назад, придерживал ею барина. Таким образом, уже на прокурорских дрожках доехал он к себе в гостиницу, где долго еще у него вертелся на языке всякий вздор: белокурая невеста с румянцем и ямочкой на правой щеке, херсонские деревни, капиталы. Селифану даже были даны кое-какие хозяйственные приказания: собрать всех вновь переселившихся мужиков, чтобы сделать всем лично поголовную перекличку. Селифан молча слушал очень долго и потом вышел из комнаты, сказавши Петрушке: «Ступай раздевать барина!» Петрушка принялся снимать с него сапоги и чуть не стащил вместе с ними на пол и самого барина. Но наконец сапоги были сняты, барин разделся как следует и, поворочавшись несколько времени на постеле, которая скрыпела немилосердно, заснул решительно херсонским помещиком. А Петрушка между тем вынес на коридор панталоны и фрак брусничного цвета с искрой, который, растопыривши на деревянную вешалку, начал бить хлыстом и щеткой, напустивши пыли на весь коридор. Готовясь уже снять их, он взглянул с галереи вниз и увидел Селифана, возвращавшегося из конюшни. Они встретились взглядами и чутьем поняли друг друга: барин-де завалился спать, можно и заглянуть кое-куда. Тот же час, отнесши в комнату фрак и панталоны, Петрушка сошел вниз, и оба пошли вместе, не говоря друг другу ничего о цели путешествия и балагуря дорогою совершенно о постороннем. Прогулку сделали они недалекую: именно, перешли только на другую сторону улицы, к дому, бывшему насупротив гостиницы, и вошли в низенькую стеклянную закоптившуюся дверь, приводившую почти в подвал, где уже сидело за деревянными столами много всяких: и бривших и не бривших бороды, и в нагольных тулупах и просто в рубахе, а кое-кто и во фризовой шинели. Что делали там Петрушка с Селифаном, бог их ведает, но вышли они оттуда через час, взявшись за руки, сохраняя совершенное молчание, оказывая друг другу большое внимание и предостерегая взаимно от всяких углов. Рука в руку, не выпуская друг друга, они целые четверть часа взбирались на лестницу, наконец одолели ее и взошли. Петрушка остановился с минуту перед низенькою своею кроватью, придумывая, как бы лечь приличнее, и лег совершенно поперек, так что ноги его упирались в пол. Селифан лег и сам на той же кровати, поместив голову у Петрушки на брюхе и позабыв о том, что ему следовало спать вовсе не здесь, а, может быть, в людской, если не в конюшне близ лошадей. Оба заснули в ту же минуту, поднявши храп неслыханной густоты, на который барин из другой комнаты отвечал тонким носовым свистом. Скоро вслед за ними все угомонились, и гостиница объялась непробудным сном; только в одном окошечке виден еще был свет, где жил какой-то приехавший из Рязани поручик, большой, по-видимому, охотник до сапогов, потому что заказал уже четыре пары и беспрестанно примеривал пятую. Несколько раз подходил он к постели, с тем чтобы их скинуть и лечь, но никак не мог: сапоги, точно, были хорошо сшиты, и долго еще поднимал он ногу и обсматривал бойко и на диво стачанный каблук.","Chichikov cheered with everyone. ""No, no, not yet!"" - said those who were more cheerful, and again clinked glasses; then they climbed for the third time to clink glasses, and clinked glasses for the third time. In a short time, everyone became unusually cheerful. The chairman, who was a sweet man, when he was cheerful, hugged Chichikov several times, saying in an outpouring of the heart: “You are my soul! my mother!"" - and even, snapping his fingers, went to dance around him, humming a famous song: ""Oh, you are such and such a Kamarinsky peasant."" After the champagne, the Hungarian champagne was opened, which gave even more spirit and amused the society. Whist was completely forgotten; they argued, shouted, talked about everything: about politics, about military affairs, even, expressed free thoughts, for which at another time they themselves would have flogged their children. We immediately resolved many of the most difficult issues. Chichikov never felt in such a cheerful disposition, imagined himself already a real Kherson landowner, talked about various improvements: about a three-field economy, about the happiness and bliss of two souls, and began to read Sobakevich a message in Werther's verse to Charlotte, on which he only clapped his eyes , sitting in armchairs, because after the sturgeon felt a great urge to sleep. Chichikov himself realized that he had already begun to untie himself too much, asked for a carriage and took advantage of the prosecutor's droshky. The prosecutor's coachman, as it turned out on the road, was an experienced fellow, because he drove with only one hand, and thrusting the other back, he held the master with it. Thus, already on the prosecutor's droshky, he drove to his hotel, where for a long time all sorts of nonsense was spinning in his mouth: a blond bride with a blush and a dimple on her right cheek, Kherson villages, capitals. Selifan was even given some economic orders: to gather all the newly resettled peasants in order to make a personal roll call to everyone. Selifan listened in silence for a very long time and then left the room, saying to Petrushka: ""Go undress the master!"" Petrushka began to take off his boots and almost dragged the master himself to the floor along with them. But at last the boots were taken off, the master undressed properly, and after tossing and turning for some time on the bed, which creaked mercilessly, he fell asleep, decidedly a Kherson landowner. And Petrushka, meanwhile, brought out into the corridor pantaloons and a lingonberry-colored tailcoat with a spark, which, spreading it on a wooden hanger, began to beat with a whip and a brush, spreading dust over the entire corridor. Preparing to take them off, he looked down from the gallery and saw Selifan returning from the stable. Their eyes met and instinctively understood each other: the master had fallen asleep, it was possible to look somewhere. At the same hour, having carried his tailcoat and trousers into the room, Petrushka went downstairs, and both went off together, saying nothing to each other about the purpose of the journey, and joking along the way about completely strangers. They made a short walk: in fact, they only crossed to the other side of the street, to the house that was opposite the hotel, and entered a low, sooty glass door that led almost to the basement, where many people were already sitting at wooden tables: both those who shaved and those who did not shave their beards, and in naked sheepskin coats and simply in a shirt, and some in a frieze overcoat. What Petrushka and Selifan were doing there, God knows them, but they left an hour later, holding hands, maintaining perfect silence, showing each other great attention and warning each other against all angles. Hand in hand, not letting go of each other, they climbed the stairs for a whole quarter of an hour, finally overcame it and went up. Petrushka stopped for a minute in front of his low bed, contemplating how to lie down more decently, and lay down completely across, so that his legs rested on the floor. Selifan himself lay down on the same bed, placing his head on Petrushka's belly and forgetting that he should not have slept here at all, but perhaps in the men's room, if not in the stable near the horses. Both fell asleep at the same moment, raising snores of unheard-of density, to which the master from the other room answered with a thin nasal whistle. Soon, after them, everyone calmed down, and the hotel fell into a deep sleep; only in one little window was light still visible, where lived some lieutenant who had come from Ryazan, a big, apparently, hunter of boots, because he had already ordered four pairs and was constantly trying on a fifth. Several times he went up to the bed in order to throw them off and lie down, but could not in any way: the boots, as if, were well-tailored, and for a long time he raised his leg and examined the briskly and wonderfully stitched heel.","Tchitchikov clinked glasses with everyone. “Again, again,” cried some of the more persistent and clinked glasses again, some pushed forward a third time and they clinked glasses once more. In a little while they were all extraordinarily lively. The president who was a most charming person when he was a little elevated, embraced Tchitchikov several times, exclaiming in the fullness of his heart: “My dear soul, my precious!” and even, snapping his fingers, fell to pirouetting round him, humming the well-known song, “You are this and you are that, you Kamarinsky peasant!”cc After the champagne, they opened some bottles of Hungarian wine, which put still more spirit into the party and made them merrier than ever. The whist was completely forgotten. They disputed, shouted, talked about everything, about politics, even about military matters, giving expression to advanced ideas for which at any other time they would have thrashed their own children. They settled on the spot a number of the most difficult questions. Tchitchikov had never felt so merry, he imagined himself already a genuine Kherson landowner, talked of various improvements he meant to make, of the three-field system of cropping, of the bliss and happiness of two kindred souls, and began repeating to Sobakevitch Werther’s letter in verse to Charlotte,cd on which the latter merely blinked as he sat in an armchair, for after the sturgeon he felt a great inclination for sleep. Tchitchikov perceived himself that he had begun to be a little too expansive, he asked for his carriage, and accepted the offer of the prosecutor’s racing droshky. The prosecutor’s coachman was, as it turned out on the way, an efficient and experienced fellow, for he drove with one hand only, while he held the gentleman on with the other hand thrust out behind him. It was in this fashion that our hero arrived at his hotel, where his tongue still went on babbling all sorts of nonsense about a fair-haired bride with a rosy complexion and a dimple in her right cheek, estates in Kherson, and investments. Selifan even received some orders in regard to the management of the estate, he was told to collect together all the newly settled peasants that they might all answer to a roll-call. Selifan listened for a long time in silence and then went out of the room, saying to Petrushka: “Go and undress the master!” Petrushka set to work to pull off his boots and nearly pulled his master on to the floor with them. At last the boots were off, the master was properly undressed, and after turning over several times on the bed, which creaked mercilessly, he fell asleep like a genuine Kherson landowner. Meanwhile Petrushka carried out into the passage his master’s breeches and his shot cranberry-coloured coat, and spreading them out on a wooden hatstand, began beating and brushing them, filling the whole corridor with dust. As he was about to take the clothes down, he glanced over the bannisters, and saw Selifan coming in from the stable. Their eyes met, they understood each other: the master had gone to sleep and they could go and look in somewhere. Instantly taking the coat and trousers into the room, Petrushka went downstairs and they set off together, without one word to each other as to the object of their journey, chattering on the way upon quite extraneous matters. They did not walk far: in fact they only went to the other side of the street to a house that was opposite the hotel, and in at a low grimy glass door, which led down almost to the cellar, where many people of different sorts, shaven and un shaven, in plain sheepskins or simply in their shirt sleeves, and here and there a frieze overcoat, were sitting at the wooden tables. What Petrushka and Selifan did there, God only knows; but they came out an hour later, arm in arm, maintaining complete silence, showing great solicitude for each other, and steering each other clear of all corners. Still arm in arm they spent a quarter of an hour getting up the stairs, at last got the better of them and reached the top. Petrushka stood for a minute facing his low bed, considering which way it would be more suitable to lie on it, and finally lay across it at right angles, so that his legs were on the floor. Selifan lay down on the same bed with his head on Petrushka’s stomach, oblivious of the fact that he ought not to have been sleeping there, but perhaps in the servants’ room, or even in the stable, with the horses. They both fell asleep at the same instant and raised a snore of an incredibly deep note, to which their master responded from the next room with a refined nasal whistle. Soon afterwards everything was still and all the hotel was wrapped in profound slumber; only in one window a light was still to be seen, from the room occupied by the lieutenant from Kazan,ce apparently a great connoisseur in boots, for he had already bought himself four pairs and was continually trying on a fifth. Several times he went up to his bed to take them off and go to bed, but could not bring himself to do so; the boots were certainly well made, and he still sat a long while lifting up his foot and scrutinising the smartly and beautifully shaped heel.","And with that every one approached to clink glasses with him, and he readily accepted the compliment, and accepted it many times in succession. Indeed, as the hours passed on, the hilarity of the company increased yet further, and more than once the President (a man of great urbanity when thoroughly in his cups) embraced the chief guest of the day with the heartfelt words, “My dearest fellow! My own most precious of friends!” Nay, he even started to crack his fingers, to dance around Chichikov’s chair, and to sing snatches of a popular song. To the champagne succeeded Hungarian wine, which had the effect of still further heartening and enlivening the company. By this time every one had forgotten about whist, and given himself up to shouting and disputing. Every conceivable subject was discussed, including politics and military affairs; and in this connection guests voiced jejune opinions for the expression of which they would, at any other time, have soundly spanked their offspring. Chichikov, like the rest, had never before felt so gay, and, imagining himself really and truly to be a landowner of Kherson, spoke of various improvements in agriculture, of the three-field system of tillage 33, and of the beatific felicity of a union between two kindred souls. Also, he started to recite poetry to Sobakevitch, who blinked as he listened, for he greatly desired to go to sleep. At length the guest of the evening realised that matters had gone far enough, so begged to be given a lift home, and was accommodated with the Public Prosecutor’s drozhki. Luckily the driver of the vehicle was a practised man at his work, for, while driving with one hand, he succeeded in leaning backwards and, with the other, holding Chichikov securely in his place. Arrived at the inn, our hero continued babbling awhile about a flaxen-haired damsel with rosy lips and a dimple in her right cheek, about villages of his in Kherson, and about the amount of his capital. Nay, he even issued seignorial instructions that Selifan should go and muster the peasants about to be transferred, and make a complete and detailed inventory of them. For a while Selifan listened in silence; then he left the room, and instructed Petrushka to help the barin to undress. As it happened, Chichikov’s boots had no sooner been removed than he managed to perform the rest of his toilet without assistance, to roll on to the bed (which creaked terribly as he did so), and to sink into a sleep in every way worthy of a landowner of Kherson. Meanwhile Petrushka had taken his master’s coat and trousers of bilberry-coloured check into the corridor; where, spreading them over a clothes’ horse, he started to flick and to brush them, and to fill the whole corridor with dust. Just as he was about to replace them in his master’s room he happened to glance over the railing of the gallery, and saw Selifan returning from the stable. Glances were exchanged, and in an instant the pair had arrived at an instinctive understanding—an understanding to the effect that the barin was sound asleep, and that therefore one might consider one’s own pleasure a little. Accordingly Petrushka proceeded to restore the coat and trousers to their appointed places, and then descended the stairs; whereafter he and Selifan left the house together. Not a word passed between them as to the object of their expedition. On the contrary, they talked solely of extraneous subjects. Yet their walk did not take them far; it took them only to the other side of the street, and thence into an establishment which immediately confronted the inn. Entering a mean, dirty courtyard covered with glass, they passed thence into a cellar where a number of customers were seated around small wooden tables. What thereafter was done by Selifan and Petrushka God alone knows. At all events, within an hour’s time they issued, arm in arm, and in profound silence, yet remaining markedly assiduous to one another, and ever ready to help one another around an awkward corner. Still linked together—never once releasing their mutual hold—they spent the next quarter of an hour in attempting to negotiate the stairs of the inn; but at length even that ascent had been mastered, and they proceeded further on their way. Halting before his mean little pallet, Petrushka stood awhile in thought. His difficulty was how best to assume a recumbent position. Eventually he lay down on his face, with his legs trailing over the floor; after which Selifan also stretched himself upon the pallet, with his head resting upon Petrushka’s stomach, and his mind wholly oblivious of the fact that he ought not to have been sleeping there at all, but in the servant’s quarters, or in the stable beside his horses. Scarcely a moment had passed before the pair were plunged in slumber and emitting the most raucous snores; to which their master (next door) responded with snores of a whistling and nasal order. Indeed, before long every one in the inn had followed their soothing example, and the hostelry lay plunged in complete restfulness. Only in the window of the room of the newly-arrived lieutenant from Riazan did a light remain burning. Evidently he was a devotee of boots, for he had purchased four pairs, and was now trying on a fifth. Several times he approached the bed with a view to taking off the boots and retiring to rest; but each time he failed, for the reason that the boots were so alluring in their make that he had no choice but to lift up first one foot, and then the other, for the purpose of scanning their elegant welts.","Chichikov clinked with everyone. “No, no, again!” said the more enthusiastic ones, and clinked again all around; then they came at him to clink a third time, and so they all clinked a third time. In a short while everyone was feeling extraordinarily merry. The magistrate, who was the nicest of men when he got merry, embraced Chichikov several times, uttering in heartfelt effusion: “My dear soul! my sweetie pie!” and, snapping his fingers, even went around him in a little dance, singing the well-known song: “Ah, you blankety-blank Komarinsky muzhik. ”32 After the champagne a Hungarian wine was broached, which raised their spirits still more and made the company all the merrier. Whist was decidedly forgotten; they argued, shouted, discussed everything—politics, even military affairs—expounded free thoughts for which, at another time, they would have whipped their own children. Resolved on the spot a host of the most difficult questions. Chichikov had never felt himself in so merry a mood, already imagined himself a real Kherson landowner, talked of various improvements—the three-field system, the happiness and bliss of twin souls—and began reciting to Sobakevich Werther’s letter in verse to Charlotte,33 at which the man only blinked from his armchair, for after the sturgeon he felt a great urge to sleep. Chichikov himself realized that he was beginning to get much too loose, asked about a carriage, and availed himself of the prosecutor’s droshky. The prosecutor’s coachman, as it turned out on the way, was an experienced fellow, because he drove with one hand only, while holding up the master behind him with the other. Thus, on the prosecutor’s droshky, he reached his inn, where for a long time still he had all sorts of nonsense on the tip of his tongue: a fair-haired bride, blushing and with a dimple on her right cheek, Kherson estates, capital. Selifan was even given some managerial orders: to gather all the newly resettled muzhiks, so as to make an individual roll call of them all personally. Selifan listened silently for quite a while and then walked out of the room, saying to Petrushka: “Go undress the master!” Petrushka started taking his boots off and together with them almost pulled the master onto the floor. But the boots were finally taken off, the master got undressed properly, and after tossing for some time on his bed, which creaked unmercifully, fell asleep a confirmed Kherson landowner. And Petrushka meanwhile brought out to the corridor the trousers and the cranberry-colored tailcoat with flecks, spread them on a wooden clothes rack, and set about beating them with a whip and brush, filling the whole corridor with dust. As he was about to take them down, he glanced over the gallery railing and saw Selifan coming back from the stable. Their eyes met, and they intuitively understood each other: the master has hit the sack, so why not peek in somewhere or other. That same moment, after taking the tailcoat and trousers to the room, Petrushka came downstairs, and the two went off together, saying nothing to each other about the goal of their trip and gabbing on the way about totally unrelated matters. They did not stroll far: to be precise, they simply crossed to the other side of the street, to the house that stood facing the inn, and entered a low, sooty glass door that led almost to the basement, where various sorts were already sitting at wooden tables: some who shaved their beards, and some who did not, some in sheepskin coats, and some simply in shirts, and a few even in frieze greatcoats. What Petrushka and Selifan did there, God only knows, but they came out an hour later holding each other by the arm, keeping a perfect silence, according each other great attention, with mutual warnings against various corners. Arm in arm, not letting go of each other, they spent a whole quarter of an hour going up the stairs, finally managed it and got up. Petrushka paused for a moment before his low bed, pondering the most suitable way of lying down, and then lay down perfectly athwart it, so that his feet rested on the floor. Selifan lay himself down on the same bed, placing his head on Petrushka’s stomach, forgetting that he ought not to be sleeping there at all, but perhaps somewhere in the servants’ quarters, if not in the stable with the horses. They both fell asleep that same moment and set up a snoring of unheard-of density, to which the master responded from the other room with a thin nasal whistle. Soon after them everything quieted down, and the inn was enveloped in deep sleep; only in one little window was there still light, where lived some lieutenant, come from Ryazan, a great lover of boots by the look of it, because he had already ordered four pairs made and was ceaselessly trying on a fifth. Several times he had gone over to his bed with the intention of flinging them off and lying down, but he simply could not: the boots were indeed well made, and for a long time still he kept raising his foot and examining the smart and admirable turn of the heel.","Chichikov dutifully clinked glasses with all of them. “No, no, let’s clink glasses some more,” said those who felt especially lively, and they clinked glasses with him anew, and for a third time as well did they all clink glasses. In a short while they all grew extraordinarily jolly. The Chairman (you couldn’t find a more charming man, once he became thoroughly jolly), embraced Chichikov several times, uttering in heartfelt effusiveness: “My soul! My little mama!” and even, snapping his fingers, went into a dance around him, singing as he did so the well-known song: “Ah, you Kamarinskii muzhik, you’re this and you’re that!” After the champagne they uncorked some Hungarian wine, which added still more spirit and gaiety to the gathering. They had forgotten all about whist; they disputed and shouted and spoke of everything on earth, of politics and even of military matters; they propounded free and daring ideas for which, at another time, they themselves would have given their children a sound whipping. Right then and there they resolved a multitude of the most difficult problems. Never had Chichikov felt himself in so jolly a mood; by this time he imagined he really was a landowner of Kherson; he spoke of various improvements, of the scientific rotation of crops, of the happiness and bliss of twin souls, and began reciting to Sobakevich Werther’s versified epistle to Charlotte, in answer to which Sobakevich only batted his eyes as he sat in his easy chair, since after the sturgeon he felt a great tendency to sleep.2 Chichikov even surmised himself that he was become too expansive, asked for a carriage, and gladly availed himself of the Public Prosecutor’s droshky. The Public Prosecutor’s coachman, as it turned out on the way, was an experienced lad, since he directed the reins with only one hand, while with the other hand placed behind him, he kept the gentleman right end up. In such fashion did the Public Prosecutor’s droshky get him at last to his inn, where for a long while yet all sorts of nonsense kept coming to the tip of his tongue: about a flaxen-fair bride with rosy-red cheeks and a little dimple on the right one, about villages in Kherson, about lots of capital. Selifan was even given certain household instructions about getting all the newly resettled serfs together in order to have a roll call. Selifan listened in silence for a very long while and then went out of the room, after saying to Petrushka: “Go and undress the master!” Petrushka began taking Chichikov’s boots off and almost dragged his master to the floor together with them. But at last the boots were taken off, the master properly undressed, and after tossing a few times in bed, which creaked unmercifully, he fell asleep, to all intents and purposes a downright landowner of Kherson. And Petrushka in the meantime took out into the corridor his master’s trousers and the frock coat of scintillating lingonberry red, which, after spreading it on a wooden hanger, he began cleaning with a beater and a brush, filling the whole corridor with dust. As he was about to remove the garment, he happened to look down from the gallery and caught sight of Selifan in the courtyard, returning from the stable. Their eyes met and intuitively they understood each other : the master is asleep!—they would be able to drop in at a place or two. Right away, having carried the frock coat and trousers into the room, Petrushka went down and the two walked off together, without saying a word to each other about their destination and chaffing each other on their way about something utterly irrelevant. Their jaunt was not a protracted one—to be precise, they crossed over to the other side of the street, to a house that was opposite the inn, and entered a small low glass door, all covered with soot, which led into something that was practically a basement, where there were already a number of all sorts of folk seated at wooden tables: those who were clean-shaven and those who were bearded, those who wore unlined sheepskin jackets and those who wore little more than a shirt, while here and there was a fellow in a coarse tufted frieze overcoat. What Petrushka and Selifan did there God alone knows; but they came out an hour later, arm in arm, preserving a perfect silence, paying a great deal of attention to each other and mutually watchful of running into any sharp corners. Arm in arm, without letting go of each other, they took all of a quarter of an hour to climb the staircase until finally they got the better of it and reached the top. Petrushka stopped for a minute before his low cot, considering how he might lie down most conveniently, and wound up lying right across it, so that his feet were propped against the floor. Selifan too lay down on the same cot, pillowing his head on Petrushka’s belly and forgetting entirely that this was not at all the place where he was supposed to sleep, which was in the house-serfs’ quarters, perhaps, if not in the stable, next to the horses. Both fell asleep the same minute, raising a snore of unheard-of intensity, to which their master in the other room responded with a high-pitched nasal whistle. Soon after the arrival of the two, everything quieted down, and the inn was enveloped in profound sleep, save that in a single little window there was still a light to be seen, where some lieutenant, the one who had come from Riazan, lived. Evidently he had a great weakness for boots, because he had already bought himself four pair and was now incessantly trying on a fifth. Several times he approached the bed in order to throw them off and lie down but somehow could not bring himself to do so; the boots really were well made, and for a long while yet did he keep on lifting now this foot and now the other and inspecting the deftly and wondrously turned heel of each boot."
— Будто? — вскрикнул Чичиков. — И я буду совершенно оправдан?,"- Like? Chichikov screamed. ""And I'll be completely justified?""","Thirty thousand for all and nothing more!” “Really,” cried Tchitchikov, “and shall I be entirely acquitted?”","“Indeed!” said Chichikov. “And, for that, shall I be completely exonerated?”",“Really?” Chichikov cried out. “And I’ll be completely vindicated?”,
"— Да за что же припекут, коли я не брала и в руки четвертки? Уж скорее другой какой бабьей слабостью, а воровством меня еще никто не попрекал.","- But what will they bake for, if I didn’t even take a quarter in my hands? It’s more like some other woman’s weakness, and no one has yet reproached me with theft.","“Why should they toast me, when I have never touched the paper? Other womanish weaknesses maybe, but thieving nobody has ever charged me with before.”",“But why should I be roasted when I have never even TOUCHED the paper? You might accuse me of any other fault than theft.”,"“And why make it hot, since I never laid a finger on your writing paper? Sooner some other female weakness, but no one has yet reproached me for thievery.”","“But why should they be making it hot for me, when I never laid a finger on that paper? If it were some other womanish frailty, well and good, but thieving is something no one has ever yet reproached me with.”"
"А за ужином опять объелись. Когда вошел Павел Иванович в отведенную комнату для спанья и, ложась в постель, пощупал животик свой: «Барабан! — сказал, — никакой городничий не взойдет!» Надобно же было такому стеченью обстоятельств: за стеной был кабинет хозяина. Стена была тонкая, и слышалось все, что там ни говорилось. Хозяин заказывал повару, под видом раннего завтрака, на завтрашний день, решительный обед. И как заказывал! У мертвого родился бы аппетит. И губами подсасывал, и причмокивал. Раздавалось только: «Да поджарь, да дай взопреть хорошенько!» А повар приговаривал тоненькой фистулой: «Слушаю-с. Можно-с. Можно-с и такой».","And at dinner they ate again. When Pavel Ivanovich entered the allotted sleeping room and, lying down in bed, felt his tummy: “Drum! - he said, - no mayor will ascend! It was necessary to have such a combination of circumstances: behind the wall was the owner's office. The wall was thin, and everything that was said there could be heard. The owner ordered the cook, under the guise of an early breakfast, for the next day, a decisive dinner. And as ordered! The dead would have an appetite. And he sucked his lips, and smacked his lips. It was only heard: “Yes, fry, but let me buck up properly!” And the cook kept saying in a thin fistula: “I'm listening, sir. May with. It is possible, with such a one.","At supper they over-ate themselves again. When Pavel Ivanovitch had retired to the room assigned to him, and had got into bed, he felt his stomach: “It’s as tight as a drum!” he said; “no mayor could possibly get in.” As luck would have it, his host’s room was the other side of the wall, the wall was a thin one and everything that was said was audible. On the pretence of an early lunch he was giving the cook directions for a regular dinner, and what directions! It was enough to give a dead man an appetite. He licked and smacked his lips. There were continually such phrases as: “ But roast it well, let it soak well.” While the cook kept saying in a thin high voice: “Yes sir, I can, I can do that too.”","By the time that supper was finished the party had again over-eaten themselves, and when Chichikov entered the room allotted him for the night, he lay down upon the bed, and prodded his stomach. “It is as tight as a drum,” he said to himself. “Not another titbit of veal could now get into it.” Also, circumstances had so brought it about that next door to him there was situated his host’s apartment; and since the intervening wall was thin, Chichikov could hear every word that was said there. At the present moment the master of the house was engaged in giving the cook orders for what, under the guise of an early breakfast, promised to constitute a veritable dinner. You should have heard Pietukh’s behests! They would have excited the appetite of a corpse. “Yes,” he said, sucking his lips, and drawing a deep breath, “in the first place, make a pasty in four divisions.","And at supper they again ate too much. When Pavel Ivanovich came to the room where he was to sleep, and, getting into bed, felt his tummy: “A drum!” he said, “no governor could possibly get in!” Just imagine such a coincidence: on the other side of the wall was the host’s study. The wall was thin and one could hear everything that was being said there. The host was ordering the cook to prepare for the next day, in the guise of an early lunch, a decided dinner. And how he was ordering it! It was enough to make a dead man hungry. He sucked and smacked his lips. One heard only: “ And fry it, and then let it stew nice and long!” And the cook kept saying in a thin falsetto: “Yes, sir. It can be done, sir. That can be done, too, sir.”",

"— Нет, больше двух рублей я не могу дать, — сказал Чичиков.","""No, I can't give more than two rubles,"" said Chichikov.","“No, I can’t give more than two roubles,” said Tchitchikov.","“Nevertheless, I CANNOT give you more than two roubles per head,” said Chichikov.","“No, more than two roubles I cannot give,” said Chichikov.","“No,” said Chichikov, “more than two rubles I cannot give you.”"
"— Ах, Павел Иванович, Павел Иванович! — говорил Муразов, скорбно смотря на него и качая головой. — Я все думаю о том, какой бы из вас был человек, если бы так же, и силою и терпеньем, да подвизались бы на добрый труд и для лучшей цели! Если бы хоть кто-нибудь из тех людей, которые любят добро, да употребили бы столько усилий для него, как вы для добыванья своей копейки!.. да умели бы так пожертвовать для добра и собственным самолюбием, и честолюбием, не жалея себя, как вы не жалели для добыванья своей копейки!..","“Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, Pavel Ivanovich! said Murazov, looking mournfully at him and shaking his head. “I keep thinking about what kind of a person you would be if, in the same way, with strength and patience, you would strive for good work and for a better goal!” If only one of those people who love goodness would use as much effort for it as you do to get your penny! you did not spare your penny for getting it! ..","“Ah, Pavel Ivanovitch, Pavel Ivanovitch!” said Murazov, looking mournfully at him and shaking his head. “I keep thinking what a man you might have made if with the same energy and patience you had applied yourself to honest labour and for a better object! If only any one of those who care for what is good had used as much energy in its service as you have to gain your kopecks! ... And had been capable of sacrificing personal vanity and pride, without sparing himself, for a good cause as you have done to gain your kopecks!”","“Paul Ivanovitch, Paul Ivanovitch,” at length said Murazov, “what could not each of us rise to be did we but devote to good ends the same measure of energy and of patience which we bestow upon unworthy objects! How much good would not you yourself have effected! Yet I do not grieve so much for the fact that you have sinned against your fellow as I grieve for the fact that you have sinned against yourself and the rich store of gifts and opportunities which has been committed to your care. Though originally destined to rise, you have wandered from the path and fallen.”","“Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, Pavel Ivanovich!” Murazov was saying, looking at him mournfully and shaking his head. “I keep thinking what a man you’d be if, in the same way, with energy and patience, you had embarked on good work and for a better purpose! If only any one of those who love the good would apply as much effort to it as you did to procuring your kopeck! … and knew how to sacrifice to that good their own self-love and ambition, without sparing themselves, as you did not spare yourself in procuring your kopeck!…”",

"Скоро Тентетников свыкнулся с службою, но только она сделалась у него не первым делом и целью, как он полагал было вначале, но чем-то вторым. Она служила ему распределеньем времени, заставив его более дорожить оставшимися минутами. Дядя, действительный статский советник, уже начинал было думать, что в племяннике будет прок, как вдруг племянник подгадил. Надобно сказать, что в числе друзей Андрея Ивановича попалось два человека, которые были то, что называется огорченные люди. Это были те беспокойно-странные характеры, которые не могут переносить равнодушно не только несправедливостей, но даже и всего того, что кажется в их глазах несправедливостью. Добрые поначалу, но беспорядочные сами в своих действиях, они исполнены нетерпимости к другим. Пылкая речь их и благородный образ негодованья подействовали на него сильно. Разбудивши в нем нервы и дух раздражительности, они заставили замечать все те мелочи, на которые он прежде и не думал обращать внимание. Федор Федорович Леницын, начальник того отделения, в котором он числился, человек наиприятнейшей наружности, вдруг ему не понравился. Он стал отыскивать в нем бездну недостатков и возненавидел его за то, будто бы он выражал в лице своем чересчур много сахару, когда говорил с высшим, и тут же, оборотившись к низшему, становился весь уксус. «Я бы ему простил, — говорил Тентетников, — если бы эта перемена происходила не так скоро в его лице; но как тут же, при моих глазах, и сахар и уксус в одно и то же время!» С этих пор он стал замечать всякий шаг. Ему казалось, что и важничал Федор Федорович уже чересчур, что имел он все замашки мелких начальников, как-то: брать на замечанье тех, которые не являлись к нему с поздравленьем в праздники, даже мстить всем тем, которых имена не находились у швейцара на листе, и множество разных тех грешных принадлежностей, без которых не обходится ни добрый, ни злой человек. Он почувствовал к нему отвращенье нервическое. Какой-то злой дух толкал его сделать что-нибудь неприятное Федору Федоровичу. Он наискивался на это с каким-то особым наслаждением и в том успел. Раз поговорил он с ним до того крупно, что ему объявлено было от начальства — или просить извинения, или выходить в отставку. Он подал в отставку. Дядя, действительный статский советник, приехал к нему перепуганный и умоляющий.","Soon Tentetnikov got used to the service, but only it became not his first business and goal, as he thought it was at first, but something second. She served him as a time manager, making him cherish the remaining minutes more. My uncle, a real councilor of state, was already beginning to think that his nephew would be useful, when suddenly the nephew screwed up. It must be said that among Andrei Ivanovich's friends there were two people who were what are called distressed people. These were those restless-strange characters who cannot endure with indifference not only injustice, but even everything that seems in their eyes to be injustice. Kind at first, but disorderly in their own actions, they are full of intolerance towards others. Their ardent speech and noble image of indignation had a strong effect on him. Having awakened in him the nerves and the spirit of irritability, they made him notice all those little things that he had not thought to pay attention to before. Fedor Fedorovich Lenitsyn, the head of the department in which he was registered, a man of the most pleasant appearance, suddenly did not like him. He began to look for an abyss of shortcomings in him and hated him for the fact that he expressed too much sugar in his face when he spoke with the higher, and immediately, turning to the lower, all the vinegar became. “I would forgive him,” said Tentetnikov, “if this change did not occur so soon in his face; but how right there, before my eyes, and sugar and vinegar at the same time! Since then, he began to notice every step. It seemed to him that Fyodor Fyodorovich was already putting on too much air, that he had all the manners of petty bosses, somehow: to take reprimand those who did not come to him with congratulations on holidays, even to take revenge on all those whose names were not on the porter’s sheet, and many different sinful accessories, without which neither a good nor an evil person can do. He felt a nervous disgust towards him. Some evil spirit pushed him to do something unpleasant to Fyodor Fyodorovich. He looked for it with some special pleasure, and in that he succeeded. Once he talked to him to such an extent that he was told by his superiors to either ask for an apology or resign. He resigned. Uncle, a real state councilor, came to him frightened and pleading.","Tyentyetnikov soon grew used to his office work, but it never be came his prime interest and object as he had at first expected; it always took a second place. It served as the best means of filling up his time, making him appreciate more thoroughly the moments that were left him. His uncle, the actual councillor, began to think that his nephew would be of some use, when suddenly his nephew spoilt it all. It must be mentioned that among Andrey Ivanovitch’s friends were two who belonged to the class known as disappointed men. They were those strange uncomfortable characters who not only cannot endure injustice but cannot endure anything which to their eyes appears to be injustice. Fundamentally good, though somewhat irresponsible in their own conduct, they were full of intolerance for others. Their heated talk and lofty indignation had a great effect upon him. Working upon his nerves and exciting his irritability, they made him begin to notice all sorts of trivialities to which he would never have dreamt of paying attention in the past. He took a sudden dislike to Fyodor Fyodorovitch Lyenitsyn, the chief of the department in which he served, a man of very prepossessing appearance. He began looking for a mass of defects in him, and detested him on the ground that he displayed too much sweetness in his face when he talked to his superiors and was all vinegar at once when he turned to his inferiors. “I could forgive him,” said Tyentyetnikov, “if the change did not take place so quickly in his face: but on the spot, before my eyes, he is sugar and vinegar all in a minute!” From that time forward he began to watch him at every step. He fancied that Fyodor Fyodorovitch stood on his dignity to excess, that he had all the ways of petty Jacks-in-office, that he noticed unfavourably all those who did not come to pay their respects on holidays, and that he even revenged himself on those whose names did not appear on the list of visitors kept by his porter, and a number of other shortcomings from which no man good or bad is entirely free. He felt a nervous aversion for him. Some evil spirit prompted him to do something unpleasant to Fyodor Fyodorovitch. He sought an opportunity for doing this with peculiar satisfaction and succeeded in finding one. On one occasion he spoke so rudely to him that a message was sent him from the higher authorities that he must either beg his pardon or leave the service. He sent in his resignation. His uncle, the actual civil councillor, came to him, imploring and panic-stricken: “For Christ’s sake, upon my word, Andrey Ivanovitch, what’s this you have been about?","Gradually, therefore, Tientietnikov grew more at home in the Service. Yet never did it become, for him, the main pursuit, the main object in life, which he had expected. No, it remained but one of a secondary kind. That is to say, it served merely to divide up his time, and enable him the more to value his hours of leisure. Nevertheless, just when his uncle was beginning to flatter himself that his nephew was destined to succeed in the profession, the said nephew elected to ruin his every hope. Thus it befell. Tientietnikov’s friends (he had many) included among their number a couple of fellows of the species known as “embittered.” That is to say, though good-natured souls of that curiously restless type which cannot endure injustice, nor anything which it conceives to be such, they were thoroughly unbalanced of conduct themselves, and, while demanding general agreement with their views, treated those of others with the scantiest of ceremony. Nevertheless these two associates exercised upon Tientietnikov—both by the fire of their eloquence and by the form of their noble dissatisfaction with society—a very strong influence; with the result that, through arousing in him an innate tendency to nervous resentment, they led him also to notice trifles which before had escaped his attention. An instance of this is seen in the fact that he conceived against Thedor Thedorovitch Lienitsin, Director of one of the Departments which was quartered in the splendid range of offices before mentioned, a dislike which proved the cause of his discerning in the man a host of hitherto unmarked imperfections. Above all things did Tientietnikov take it into his head that, when conversing with his superiors, Lienitsin became, of the moment, a stick of luscious sweetmeat, but that, when conversing with his inferiors, he approximated more to a vinegar cruet. Certain it is that, like all petty-minded individuals, Lienitsin made a note of any one who failed to offer him a greeting on festival days, and that he revenged himself upon any one whose visiting-card had not been handed to his butler. Eventually the youth’s aversion almost attained the point of hysteria; until he felt that, come what might, he MUST insult the fellow in some fashion. To that task he applied himself con amore; and so thoroughly that he met with complete success. That is to say, he seized on an occasion to address Lienitsin in such fashion that the delinquent received notice either to apologise or to leave the Service; and when of these alternatives he chose the latter his uncle came to him, and made a terrified appeal.","Tentetnikov soon got accustomed to the service, only it became not the first thing or aim, as he had thought at the start, but something secondary. It served to organize his time, making him better cherish the remaining minutes. The uncle, the actual state councillor, was already beginning to think that something good would come of his nephew, when the nephew suddenly mucked things up. It must be said that among Andrei Ivanovich’s friends there were two of what are known as disgruntled men. They were the sort of troublesomely strange characters who are unable to bear with equanimity not only injustice, but even anything that in their eyes looks like injustice. Basically kind, but disorderly in their actions, they were full of intolerance towards others. Their ardent talk and loftily indignant manner influenced him greatly. Arousing the nerves and the spirit of vexation in him, they made him notice all the trifles he had never even thought of paying attention to before. He suddenly took a dislike to Fyodor Fyodorovich Lenitsyn, the head of the department he worked in, a man of most agreeable appearance. He began to find myriads of faults in him, and came to hate him for having such a sugary expression when talking to a superior, and straightaway becoming all vinegar when addressing a subordinate. “I could forgive him,” said Tentetnikov, “if the change in his face did not occur so quickly; but it’s right there in front of my eyes, both sugar and vinegar at once!” After that he started noticing every step. It seemed to him that Fyodor Fyodorovich gave himself far too many airs, that he had all the ways of a minor official, to wit: making note of all those who did not come to congratulate him on festive occasions, even taking revenge on all those whose names were not found on the doorkeeper’s list, and a host of other sinful accessories which neither a good nor a wicked man can do without. He felt a nervous loathing for him. Some evil spirit prompted him to do something unpleasant to Fyodor Fyodorovich. He sought it out with some special enjoyment, and he succeeded. Once he exchanged such words with him that the authorities declared he must either apologize or retire. He sent in his resignation. His uncle, the actual state councillor, came to him all frightened and beseeching.",
"— Ну, что ж ты расходилась так? Экая занозистая! Ей скажи только одно слово, а она уж в ответ десяток! Поди-ка принеси огоньку запечатать письмо.

Yes, stop, you grab a tallow candle, lard is a foul business: it will burn - yes and no, only a loss, and you bring me a splinter!","Plyushkin did, indeed, see the paper; he stood still for a minute chewing his lips, and then brought out: “Well, why are you running on like that? You are such a stuck-up thing! If one says a word to her, she answers back a dozen. Go and bring a light for me to seal a letter. Stay! You will snatch up a tallow candle; a tallow is so soft; it burns away to nothing, it’s a waste; you bring me a burning stick!”","Then he went on: “Well, and what are you making such a noise about? If one says a single word to you, you answer back with ten. Go and fetch me a candle to seal a letter with. And mind you bring a TALLOW candle, for it will not cost so much as the other sort. And bring me a match too.”","“So, why get yourself worked up like that? Bristling all over! Say just one word to her, and she comes back with a dozen! Go fetch some fire to seal the letter.

What a touchy creature! You tell her but one word, and she’ll come back at you with ten. Go on, now, bring me something so I can seal a letter. Wait, hold on! You’ll grab a tallow candle; tallow melts, it will burn up and there’s nothing left, just so much loss; guess you’d better bring me a bit of kindling wood!”"

"— Как же так вдруг решился?.. — начал было говорить Василий, озадаченный не на шутку таким решеньем, и чуть было не прибавил: «И еще замыслил ехать с человеком, которого видишь в первый раз, который, может быть, и дрянь, и черт знает что!» И, полный недоверия, стал он рассматривать искоса Чичикова и увидел, что он держался необыкновенно прилично, сохраняя все то же приятное наклоненье головы несколько набок и почтительно-приветное выражение в лице, так что никак нельзя было узнать, какого роду был Чичиков.","“How did you decide so suddenly? ..” Vasily began to say, seriously puzzled by such a decision, and almost added: “And he also planned to go with a man whom you see for the first time, who, perhaps, is rubbish, and the devil knows what!” And, full of distrust, he began to scrutinize Chichikov sideways and saw that he behaved unusually decently, retaining the same pleasant inclination of his head somewhat to one side and a respectfully friendly expression on his face, so that it was by no means possible to find out what kind of Chichikov he was.","“How did you come to settle it so quickly?” Vassily was beginning, genuinely puzzled at such a decision, and he was almost adding: “And settled to go too with a man you have never seen before, who may be a rascal, and goodness knows what!” And filled with mistrust he looked askance at Tchitchikov, and saw that he was still standing with perfect decorum, still politely holding his head a little on one side and still maintaining the respectfully affable expression on his face, so that it was impossible to say what kind of a man he was.","“Perhaps it will rid me of my melancholy.” “What has made you come to such a sudden decision?” asked the perplexed Vassili (very nearly he added: “Fancy going travelling with a man whose acquaintance you have just made, and who may turn out to be a rascal or the devil knows what!” But, in spite of his distrust, he contented himself with another covert scrutiny of Chichikov, and this time came to the conclusion that there was no fault to be found with his exterior).","“How did you decide so suddenly …?” Vassily started to say, seriously perplexed by such a decision, and he almost added: “ And, what’s more, think of going with a man you’ve never seen before, who may be trash or devil knows what!” And, filled with mistrust, he began studying Chichikov out of the corner of his eye, and saw that he behaved with extraordinary decency, keeping his head agreeably inclined a bit to one side, and with the same respectfully cordial expression on his face, so that there was no way of knowing what sort of man Chichikov was.",
"— Знаем мы вас, как вы плохо играете! — сказал Ноздрев, выступая шашкой.","- We know you, how badly you play! - said Nozdryov, speaking with his saber.","“I know what sort of a poor player you are!” said Nozdryov, moving forward a draught.","“Ah! I know you and your poor play,” repeated Nozdrev, moving a second chessman. “I say again that it is a long time since last I had a chessman in my hand.”","“We know what a poor player you are!” said Nozdryov, advancing a piece.","“We know all about you fellows who claim to play poorly!” said Nozdrev, advancing one of his checkers."
"Но дверь растворилась. Ротозей Емельян и вор Антошка явились с салфетками, накрыли стол, поставили поднос с шестью графинами разноцветных настоек. Скоро вокруг подносов и графинов обстановилось ожерелье тарелок — икра, сыры, соленые грузди, опенки, да новые приносы из кухни чего-то в закрытых тарелках, сквозь которые слышно было ворчавшее масло. Ротозей Емельян и вор Антошка были народ хороший и расторопный. Названья эти хозяин давал только потому, что без прозвищ все как-то выходило пресно, а он пресного не любил: сам был добр душой, но словцо любил пряное. Впрочем, и люди за это не сердились.","But the door opened. Rotozei Yemelyan and the thief Antoshka came with napkins, set the table, put down a tray with six decanters of multi-colored tinctures. Soon around the trays and decanters a necklace of plates was arranged - caviar, cheeses, salted milk mushrooms, mushrooms, and new bringings from the kitchen of something in closed plates, through which grumbled butter could be heard. Rotozei Emelyan and the thief Antoshka were good and efficient people. The owner gave these names only because without nicknames everything somehow came out insipid, and he did not like insipid things: he himself was kind in soul, but he liked spicy words. However, people weren't angry about it either.","But the door opened. The sluggard Emelyan and the thief Antoshka made their appearance with table napkins, laid the table, set a tray with six decanters of various coloured homemade wines; soon round the trays and decanters there was a necklace of plates—caviare, cheese, salted mushrooms of different kinds, and something was brought in from the kitchen covered with a plate, under which could be heard the hissing of butter. The sluggard Emelyan and the thief Antoshka were quick and excellent fellows. Their master gave them those titles because to address them without nicknames seemed tame and flat, and he did not like anything to be so; he was a kind-hearted man, but liked to use words of strong flavour. His servants did not resent it, however.","At this moment the door opened, and the “gawk” and the “thief” in question made their appearance with napkins and a tray—the latter bearing six decanters of variously-coloured beverages. These they placed upon the table, and then ringed them about with glasses and platefuls of every conceivable kind of appetiser. That done, the servants applied themselves to bringing in various comestibles under covers, through which could be heard the hissing of hot roast viands. In particular did the “gawk” and the “thief” work hard at their tasks. As a matter of fact, their appellations had been given them merely to spur them to greater activity, for, in general, the barin was no lover of abuse, but, rather, a kind-hearted man who, like most Russians, could not get on without a sharp word or two. That is to say, he needed them for his tongue as he need a glass of vodka for his digestion. What else could you expect?","But the door opened. The gawk Emelyan and the thief Antoshka appeared with napkins, laid the table, set down a tray with six carafes filled with varicolored liqueurs. Soon, around the tray and the carafes lay a necklace of plates—caviar, cheeses, salted mushrooms of various sorts, and from the kitchen a newly brought something on covered dishes, from which came a gurgling of butter. The gawk Emelyan and the thief Antoshka were fine and efficient folk. The master had given them these appellations only because everything came out somehow insipid without nicknames, and he did not like insipid things; he himself had a good heart, yet he loved a spicy phrase. Anyhow, his servants were not angered by it.",

Уже пятнадцать лет как он находился под судом, и так умел распорядиться, что никак нельзя было отрешить от должности. Все знали его, за подвиги его следовало бы шесть раз уже послать на поселенье. Кругом и со всех сторон был он в подозрениях, но никаких нельзя было возвести явных и доказанных улик. Тут было действительно что-то таинственное, и его бы можно было смело признать колдуном, если бы история, нами описанная, принадлежала временам невежества.","Chichikov immediately ordered the crew to be brought in and went to the legal adviser.

There were suspicions of him all around and on every side, yet it was impossible to present any clear and proven evidence.

You can’t move like that, three pieces at a time!”","“Why, that checker, now,” said Chichikov, and at the same moment perceived, almost under his very nose, still another checker, which, so it seemed, was trying to sneak through into the king’s row.

"Это вздорное, по-видимому, происшествие заметно расстроило нашего героя. Как ни глупы слова дурака, а иногда бывают они достаточны, чтобы смутить умного человека. Он стал чувствовать себя неловко, неладно: точь-точь как будто прекрасно вычищенным сапогом вступил вдруг в грязную, вонючую лужу; словом, нехорошо, совсем нехорошо! Он пробовал об этом не думать, старался рассеяться, развлечься, присел в вист, но все пошло как кривое колесо: два раза сходил он в чужую масть и, позабыв, что по третьей не бьют, размахнулся со всей руки и хватил сдуру свою же. Председатель никак не мог понять, как Павел Иванович, так хорошо и, можно сказать, тонко разумевший игру, мог сделать подобные ошибки и подвел даже под обух его пикового короля, на которого он, по собственному выражению, надеялся, как на бога. Конечно, почтмейстер и председатель и даже сам полицеймейстер, как водится, подшучивали над нашим героем, что уж не влюблен ли он и что мы знаем, дескать, что у Павла Ивановича сердечишко прихрамывает, знаем, кем и подстрелено; но все это никак не утешало, как он ни пробовал усмехаться и отшучиваться. За ужином тоже он никак не был в состоянии развернуться, несмотря на то что общество за столом было приятное и что Ноздрева давно уже вывели; ибо сами даже дамы наконец заметили, что поведение его чересчур становилось скандалезно. Посреди котильона он сел на пол и стал хватать за полы танцующих, что было уже ни на что не похоже, по выражению дам. Ужин был очень весел, все лица, мелькавшие перед тройными подсвечниками, цветами, конфектами и бутылками, были озарены самым непринужденным довольством. Офицеры, дамы, фраки — все сделалось любезно, даже до приторности. Мужчины вскакивали со стульев и бежали отнимать у слуг блюда, чтобы с необыкновенною ловкостию предложить их дамам. Один полковник подал даме тарелку с соусом на конце обнаженной шпаги. Мужчины почтенных лет, между которыми сидел Чичиков, спорили громко, заедая дельное слово рыбой или говядиной, обмакнутой нещадным образом в горчицу, и спорили о тех предметах, в которых он даже всегда принимал участие; но он был похож на какого-то человека, уставшего или разбитого дальней дорогой, которому ничто не лезет на ум и который не в силах войти ни во что. Даже не дождался он окончания ужина и уехал к себе несравненно ранее, чем имел обыкновение уезжать.","This apparently absurd incident visibly upset our hero. Stupid as the words of a fool may be, they are sometimes sufficient to confuse an intelligent person. He began to feel awkward, out of place: exactly as if he suddenly stepped into a dirty, stinking puddle with a perfectly polished boot; In a word, not good, not good at all! He tried not to think about it, tried to distract himself, to have fun, sat down to whist, but everything went like a crooked wheel: twice he went into someone else's suit and, forgetting that they don't hit on the third, swung with all his arm and foolishly grabbed his own. The chairman could not understand how Pavel Ivanovich, who understood the game so well and, one might say, subtly, could make such mistakes and even let his king of spades under the butt, whom he, in his own words, hoped for as in God. Of course, the postmaster and the chairman, and even the police chief himself, as usual, joked with our hero that he was not in love, and that we know, they say, that Pavel Ivanovich's heart is limping, we know who shot it; but all this was no consolation, no matter how hard he tried to smile and laugh it off. At dinner, too, he was in no way able to turn around, despite the fact that the company at the table was pleasant and that Nozdryov had long since been taken out; for even the ladies themselves finally noticed that his behavior was becoming too scandalous. In the middle of the cotillion, he sat down on the floor and began to grab the dancers by the floors, which was already unlike anything, in the expression of the ladies. The supper was very cheerful, all the faces flashing in front of the triple candlesticks, flowers, sweets and bottles were lit up with the most unconstrained contentment. Officers, ladies, tailcoats - everything was done kindly, even to the point of cloying. Men jumped up from their chairs and ran to take dishes from the servants in order to offer them to the ladies with extraordinary dexterity. One colonel gave the lady a plate of sauce on the end of a drawn sword. The men of respectable years, between whom Chichikov was sitting, were arguing loudly, seizing on a practical word with fish or beef, mercilessly dipped in mustard, and arguing about those subjects in which he even always took part; but he looked like some kind of man, tired or shattered by a long journey, to whom nothing climbs in his mind and who is unable to enter into anything. He did not even wait for the end of supper and left for his place incomparably earlier than he used to leave.","This apparently nonsensical incident unmistakably upset our hero. However stupid a fool’s words may be, they are sometimes enough to upset a sensible man. He began to feel uncomfortable and ill at ease, exactly as though with highly polished boots he had stepped into a filthy, stinking puddle—in short, it was nasty, very nasty He tried not to think of it, he tried to turn the current of his thoughts, to distract his mind, and sat down to whist, but everything went awry like a crooked wheel: twice he revoked and forgetting that one should not rump in the third place, threw away his whole hand and spoilt his game by his foolishness. The president simply could not understand how Pavel Ivanovitch, who had such a good and, one might say, subtle understanding of the game, could make such blunders and had even trumped his king of spades in whom, to use his own expression, he had trusted as in God. Of course the postmaster and the president and even the police-master bantered our hero, asking whether he was in love, and declaring that Pavel Ivanovitch’s heart had been smitten, and that they knew from whom the dart had come; but all that was no comfort to him, though he did his best to laugh and turn it off with a joke. At supper, too, he was not able to recover himself, although the company at the table was agreeable and Nozdryov had been ejected some time before, for even the ladies had observed that his conduct was becoming extremely scandalous. In the middle of the cotillion, he had sat down on the floor and clutched at the skirts of the dancers, which was really beyond anything, to use the ladies’ expression. The supper was very lively; all the faces, flitting to and fro before the three-stemmed candlesticks, the flowers, the sweets and the bottles, were beaming with the most spontaneous satisfaction. Officers, ladies, gentlemen in dress coats—everything was polite to mawkishness. The gentlemen jumped up from their chairs and ran to take the dishes from the servants to offer them with rare adroitness to the ladies. One colonel handed a lady a plate of sauce on the tip of his drawn sword. The gentlemen of respectable age, among whom Tchitchikov was sitting, argued loudly, absorbing a few words about business with the fish or the beef, which was ruthlessly smothered in mustard. They discussed the very subjects in which he was always interested; but he was like a man wearied or knocked up by a long journey who has not an idea in his head and who is not capable of entering into anything. He did not even stay to the end of the supper, but went home much earlier than he generally did.","Naturally this unseemly contretemps had greatly upset our hero; for, however foolish be a madman’s words, they may yet prove sufficient to sow doubt in the minds of saner individuals. He felt much as does a man who, shod with well-polished boots, has just stepped into a dirty, stinking puddle. He tried to put away from him the occurrence, and to expand, and to enjoy himself once more. Nay, he even took a hand at whist. But all was of no avail—matters kept going as awry as a badly-bent hoop. Twice he blundered in his play, and the President of the Council was at a loss to understand how his friend, Paul Ivanovitch, lately so good and so circumspect a player, could perpetrate such a mauvais pas as to throw away a particular king of spades which the President has been “trusting” as (to quote his own expression) “he would have trusted God.” At supper, too, matters felt uncomfortable, even though the society at Chichikov’s table was exceedingly agreeable and Nozdrev had been removed, owing to the fact that the ladies had found his conduct too scandalous to be borne, now that the delinquent had taken to seating himself on the floor and plucking at the skirts of passing lady dancers. As I say, therefore, Chichikov found the situation not a little awkward, and eventually put an end to it by leaving the supper room before the meal was over, and long before the hour when usually he returned to the inn.","This apparently absurd occurrence noticeably upset our hero. However stupid a fool’s words may be, they are sometimes enough to confound an intelligent man. He began to feel uneasy, ungainly—exactly as if he had suddenly stepped with a beautifully polished shoe into a dirty, stinking puddle; in short, not good, not good at all! He tried not to think about it, tried to get diverted, distracted, sat down to whist, but it all went like a crooked wheel: twice he played into his opponents’ strong suit, and, forgetting that one does not double trump, he swung his arm and, like a fool, took his own trick. The magistrate simply could not understand how Pavel Ivanovich, who had such a good and, one might say, subtle understanding of the game, could make such mistakes and even put under the axe his king of spades, in which, to use his own words, he trusted as in God. Of course, the postmaster and the magistrate, and even the police chief himself, kept poking fun at our hero, as is customary, suggesting that he might be in love, and don’t we know that Pavel Ivanovich’s heart has been smitten, and don’t we know who shot the dart; but all this was no comfort, however much he tried to smile and laugh it off. At supper, too, he was quite unable to be expansive, though the company at table was pleasant and Nozdryov had long ago been taken out; for even the ladies themselves finally noticed that his behavior was becoming much too scandalous. In the midst of the cotillion, he got down on the floor and started grabbing the dancers by their skirt hems, which was really beyond everything, as the ladies put it. The supper was very gay, all the faces flitting before the three-stemmed candlesticks, flowers, sweets, and bottles radiated the most unconstrained pleasure. Officers, ladies, tailcoats—everything became courteous, even to the point of cloying. Men jumped up from their chairs and ran to take dishes from the servants in order to offer them, with extraordinary adroitness, to the ladies. One colonel offered a dish of sauce to a lady on the tip of his bare sword. The men of respectable age, among whom Chichikov sat, were arguing loudly, following their sensible words with fish or beef dipped unmercifully in mustard, and arguing about subjects he had even always been interested in; but he was like a man worn-out or broken by a long journey, whose mind is closed to everything and who is unable to enter into anything. He did not even wait until supper was over, and went home incomparably earlier than was his custom.","This incident, apparently so nonsensical, perceptibly upset our hero. No matter how foolish the words of the fool, yet at times they will suffice to throw a wise man into confusion. Chichikov began to feel ill at ease and out of sorts, every whit as if he had set a beautifully polished boot into a filthy, stinking puddle; in a word, things were bad, downright bad! He tried not to think of it; he tried to distract himself, to find some amusement, to sit down to whist, but everything went as badly as a crooked wheel: twice he played out of turn and, forgetting that it was not up to him to cover the third card, swung back his arm and idiotically covered his own card. The Chairman of the Administrative Offices could not, no matter how he tried, understand how Pavel Ivanovich, who had such a good—and, one might even say, such a fine—grasp of the game could make mistakes like that, and even got the best of Pavel Ivanovich’s king of spades, in which, according to the latter’s own expression, he had placed his trust as in God. Of course the Postmaster and the Chairman of the Administrative Offices, and even the Chief of Police himself, kept twitting our hero in time-honored fashion : Was he in love, perhaps, and we know, now, that Pavel Ivanovich’s little heart has been smitten ; we know, as well, who loosed the arrow that wounded it. ... But all this did not console him in the least, no matter how hard he tried to smile and to return their banter. At supper, too, he found it impossible to relax, despite the fact that the gathering at the table was a pleasant one and that Nozdrev had long since been led out, since the ladies themselves had at last remarked that his conduct was becoming far too scandaleuse. At the very height of the cotillion he had plumped down on the floor and begun grabbing the dancers by their skirts and coat flaps, which, to use an expression of the ladies, was already beyond anything, really. The supper was a very gay one; all the faces, glimpsed between triple candelabra, flowers, bottles, and bonbon-nieresy were glowing with the most unconstrained pleasure. Army officers, ladies, frock-coated gentlemen—all became amiable, even to the point of being cloying. The gentlemen leapt up from their seats and ran to relieve the waiters of their platters, so as to offer them, with extraordinary adroitness, to the ladies. One colonel offered a sauceboat to a lady at the end of his unsheathed sword. Men who had attained the decorous age, among whom Chichikov was seated, were carrying on loud discussions, driving home the point of their weighty words with gobs of fish or beef ruthlessly smothered in mustard, and their discussions dealt with the very subjects in which he always took part; but he looked like a man fatigued or broken up by a prolonged trip, who can’t get a thing into his head and who finds it beyond his strength to grasp any matter. He didn’t even wait for the supper to be over and went home incomparably earlier than he usually did."

"— Мне странно, право: кажется, между нами происходит какое-то театральное представление или комедия, иначе я не могу себе объяснить… Вы, кажется, человек довольно умный, владеете сведениями образованности.

What is he worth? who needs?","Tchitchikov thought to himself, and then he added aloud: “I am really puzzled: it seems to me as though we are taking part in some theatrical performance or farce: that’s the only way I can explain it to myself... I believe you are a fairly intelligent man, you have all the advantages of education. Why, the goods you are selling are simply . . . ough! What are they worth? What use are they to any one?”","Then he added aloud: “The situation seems to me a strange one, for it is as though we were performing a stage comedy. No other explanation would meet the case. Yet you appear to be a man of sense, and possessed of some education. The matter is a very simple one. The question is: what is a dead soul worth, and is it of any use to any one?”","“I find it strange, really: it seems some theater performance or comedy is going on between us, otherwise I can’t explain it to myself … You seem to be quite an intelligent man, you possess educated knowledge.

You are, it seems, a man who is quite intelligent, possessing knowledge and an education. Why, the matter under discussion has no more substance than a puff of air! What can such stuff be worth? Who needs it?”"
"— По две копеечки пристегну, извольте. Сколько их у вас? Вы, кажется, говорили семьдесят?","- I’ll fasten two kopecks, if you please. How many do you have? You seem to have said seventy?","“I will raise it another two kopecks, certainly. How many of them have you? I believe you said seventy”","“Pardon me, but I cannot. How many runaway serfs did you say that you possess? Seventy?”","“Two little kopecks I will tack on, if you please. How many of them do you have?

"— Жена — хлопотать! — продолжал Чичиков. — Ну, что ж может какая-нибудь неопытная молодая женщина? Спасибо, что случились добрые люди, которые посоветовали пойти на мировую. Отделался он двумя тысячами да угостительным обедом. И на обеде, когда все уже развеселились, и он также, вот и говорят они ему: «Не стыдно ли тебе так поступить с нами? Ты все бы хотел нас видеть прибранными, да выбритыми, да во фраках. Нет, ты полюби нас черненькими, а беленькими нас всякий полюбит».","- Wife - work hard! Chichikov continued. “Well, what can some inexperienced young woman do? Thank you for the good people who advised me to go to the world. He got off with two thousand and a delicious dinner.

No, you love us black, and everyone will love us white.","“His wife did all she could,” Tchitchikov went on. “But what can an inexperienced young woman do? Luckily some kind people turned up who advised her to settle it amicably. He got off for two thousand roubles and a dinner to the officials. And at the dinner when they were all rather exhilarated, and he also, they said to him—‘Aren’t you ashamed now of the way you treated us? You wanted us shaven and well got up in our dress-coats: no, you love us dirty, for any one will love us clean.’ ”","And you, sir,” he added to Chichikov, “will you not join us at table?”","“The wife went around soliciting!” Chichikov continued. “But what can a young, inexperienced woman do?

"— А, например, как же цена? хотя, впрочем, это такой предмет… что о цене даже странно…","- And, for example, what about the price? although, however, this is such an object ... which is even strange about the price ...","And aloud he said, “And at what price, for instance?

"Чичиков между тем так помышлял: «Право, было бы хорошо! Можно даже и так, что все издержки будут на его счет. Можно даже сделать и так, чтобы отправиться на его лошадях, а мои покормятся у него в деревне. Для сбереженья можно и коляску оставить у него в деревне, а в дорогу взять его коляску».","Chichikov, meanwhile, thought like this: “Really, it would be good! It is possible even so that all costs will be on his account. You can even make it so that you go on his horses, and mine will feed in his village. For savings, you can leave the stroller with him in the village, and take his stroller on the road.","Tchitchikov meanwhile reflected: “It really would be a good thing. I might manage that he should undertake all the expenses. I might even so arrange as to set off with his horses, and to leave mine to be kept in his stables, and to take his carriage for the journey.”","As a matter of fact, Chichikov was reflecting, “Yes, the plan is an excellent one. I might even contrive that he should have to bear the whole of our expenses, and that his horses should be used while my own should be put out to graze on his farm.”","Chichikov meanwhile reflected thus: “Truly, it would be nice! It could even be done so that all the expenses would go to his account. It could even be arranged so that we would take his horses and mine would be fed on his estate. I could also spare my carriage by leaving it on his estate and taking his for the road.”",
"— Не выдержал Константин Федорович, — сказал он. — Чувствую, что не весело такому хозяину, каков он, глядеть на эдакое беспутное управленье. Верите ли, что не могу, не могу, Павел Иванович… что почти вовсе не сеял хлеба в этом году! Как честный человек. Семян не было, не говоря уже о том, что нечем пахать. Ваш братец, Платон Михайлыч, говорят, необыкновенный хозяин; о Константине Федоровиче что уж говорить — это Наполеон своего рода. Часто, право, думаю: «Ну, зачем столько ума дается в одну голову? ну, что бы хоть каплю его в мою глупую, хоть бы на то, чтобы сумел дом свой держать! Ничего не умею, ничего не могу». Ах, Павел Иванович, [возьмите] в свое распоряжение! Жаль больше всего мне мужичков бедных. Чувствую, что не умел быть…[40] что прикажете делать, не могу быть взыскательным и строгим. Да и как мог приучить их к порядку, когда сам беспорядочен! Я бы их отпустил сейчас же на волю, да как-то устроен русский человек, как-то не может без понукателя… Так и задремлет, так и заплеснет.","""Konstantin Fyodorovich couldn't stand it,"" he said. - I feel that it is not fun for such a master as he is to look at such dissolute management. Do you believe that I can’t, I can’t, Pavel Ivanovich… that he hardly sowed any grain this year! Like an honest person. There were no seeds, not to mention the fact that there was nothing to plow. Your brother, Platon Mikhailovich, they say, is an extraordinary host; about Konstantin Fedorovich, what can we say - this is a kind of Napoleon. Often, really, I think: “Well, why is so much mind given to one head? well, at least a drop of it in my stupid, at least to be able to keep his house! I can't do anything, I can't do anything."" Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, [take] at your disposal! Most of all I feel sorry for the poor peasants. I feel that I didn’t know how to be…[40] what you order me to do, I can’t be exacting and strict. And how could he accustom them to order when he himself is disorderly! I would set them free at once, but the Russian person is somehow arranged, somehow he cannot do without an urge ... So he will doze off, and he will splash.","“Konstantin Fyodorovitch couldn’t endure it,” he said. “I feel that it can’t be cheering for a farmer such as he is, to look at such senseless mismanagement. Would you believe it, Pavel Ivanovitch, that I cannot, that I am not able ... that I have hardly sown any wheat at all this year! As I am an honest man I had no seed, let alone the fact that I have nothing to plough with. Your brother is an extraordinary manager I am told, Platon Mihailovitch: but Konstantin Fyodorovitch, there is no denying it, is a Napoleon in that line. I often think indeed: ‘Why is it that there is so much sense in one head? if only there were one drop of it in my silly brain, just enough to know how to manage my household.’ I don’t know how to do anything: I am no use for anything. Oh, Pavel Ivanovitch, take my land under your care. I feel most sorry for my poor peasants, I feel that I am incapable.... I don’t know how to be strict and exacting. And, indeed, how could I train them in order and regularity when I am so disorderly and irregular myself I should like to give them all their freedom at once, but a Russian’s so made that he can’t do without a purchaser.... As he drowses so he drowns.”","“It was too much for him,” he remarked. “An agriculturist of that kind does not like to have to look upon the results of such feckless management as mine. Would you believe it, Paul Ivanovitch, but this year I have been unable to sow any wheat! Am I not a fine husbandman? There was no seed for the purpose, nor yet anything with which to prepare the ground. No, I am not like Constantine Thedorovitch, who, I hear, is a perfect Napoleon in his particular line. Again and again the thought occurs to me, ‘Why has so much intellect been put into that head, and only a drop or two into my own dull pate?’ Take care of that puddle, gentlemen. I have told my peasants to lay down planks for the spring, but they have not done so. Nevertheless my heart aches for the poor fellows, for they need a good example, and what sort of an example am I? How am I to give them orders? Pray take them under your charge, Paul Ivanovitch, for I cannot teach them orderliness and method when I myself lack both. As a matter of fact, I should have given them their freedom long ago, had there been any use in my doing so; for even I can see that peasants must first be afforded the means of earning a livelihood before they can live. What they need is a stern, yet just, master who shall live with them, day in, day out, and set them an example of tireless energy. The present-day Russian—I know of it myself—is helpless without a driver. Without one he falls asleep, and the mould grows over him.”","“Konstantin Fyodorovich couldn’t stand it,” he said. “I feel that it’s not very cheery for such a proprietor as he to look at such wayward management. Believe me, I cannot, I cannot , Pavel Ivanovich … I sowed almost no grain this year! On my honor. I had no seed, not to mention nothing to plough with. Your brother, Platon Mikhailovich, is said to be an extraordinary man; and of Konstantin Fyodorovich it goes without saying— he’s a Napoleon of sorts. I often think, in fact: ‘Now, why is so much intelligence given to one head? Now, if only one little drop of it could get into my foolish pate, if only so that I could keep my house! I don’t know how to do anything, I can’t do anything!’ Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, take it into your care! Most of all I pity the poor muzhiks. I feel that I was never able to be … * what do you want me to do, I can’t be exacting and strict. And how could I get them accustomed to order if I myself am disorderly! I’d set them free right now, but the Russian man is somehow so arranged, he somehow can’t do without being prodded … He’ll just fall asleep, he’ll just get moldy.”",

Может быть, к ним следует примкнуть и Манилова. На взгляд он был человек видный; черты лица его были не лишены приятности, но в эту приятность, казалось, чересчур было передано сахару; в приемах и оборотах его было что-то заискивающее расположения и знакомства. Он улыбался заманчиво, был белокур, с голубыми глазами. В первую минуту разговора с ним не можешь не сказать: «Какой приятный и добрый человек!» В следующую за тем минуту ничего не скажешь, а в третью скажешь: «Черт знает что такое!» — и отойдешь подальше; если ж не отойдешь, почувствуешь скуку смертельную. От него не дождешься никакого живого или хоть даже заносчивого слова, какое можешь услышать почти от всякого, если коснешься задирающего его предмета. У всякого есть свой задор: у одного задор обратился на борзых собак; другому кажется, что он сильный любитель музыки и удивительно чувствует все глубокие места в ней; третий мастер лихо пообедать; четвертый сыграть роль хоть одним вершком повыше той, которая ему назначена; пятый, с желанием более ограниченным, спит и грезит о том, как бы пройтиться на гулянье с флигель-адъютантом, напоказ своим приятелям, знакомым и даже незнакомым; шестой уже одарен такою рукою, которая чувствует желание сверхъестественное заломить угол какому-нибудь бубновому тузу или двойке, тогда как рука седьмого так и лезет произвести где-нибудь порядок, подобраться поближе к личности станционного смотрителя или ямщиков, — словом, у всякого есть свое, но у Манилова ничего не было. Дома он говорил очень мало и большею частию размышлял и думал, но о чем он думал, тоже разве богу было известно. Хозяйством нельзя сказать чтобы он занимался, он даже никогда не ездил на поля, хозяйство шло как-то само собою. Когда приказчик говорил: «Хорошо бы, барин, то и то сделать», — «Да, недурно», — отвечал он обыкновенно, куря трубку, которую курить сделал привычку, когда еще служил в армии, где считался скромнейшим, деликатнейшим и образованнейшим офицером. «Да, именно недурно», — повторял он. Когда приходил к нему мужик и, почесавши рукою затылок, говорил: «Барин, позволь отлучиться на работу, по́дать заработать», — «Ступай», — говорил он, куря трубку, и ему даже в голову не приходило, что мужик шел пьянствовать. Иногда, глядя с крыльца на двор и на пруд, говорил он о том, как бы хорошо было, если бы вдруг от дома провести подземный ход или чрез пруд выстроить каменный мост, на котором бы были по обеим сторонам лавки, и чтобы в них сидели купцы и продавали разные мелкие товары, нужные для крестьян. При этом глаза его делались чрезвычайно сладкими и лицо принимало самое довольное выражение; впрочем, все эти прожекты так и оканчивались только одними словами. В его кабинете всегда лежала какая-то книжка, заложенная закладкою на четырнадцатой странице, которую он постоянно читал уже два года. В доме его чего-нибудь вечно недоставало: в гостиной стояла прекрасная мебель, обтянутая щегольской шелковой материей, которая, верно, стоила весьма недешево; но на два кресла ее недостало, и кресла стояли обтянуты просто рогожею; впрочем, хозяин в продолжение нескольких лет всякий раз предостерегал своего гостя словами: «Не садитесь на эти кресла, они еще не готовы». В иной комнате и вовсе не было мебели, хотя и было говорено в первые дни после женитьбы: «Душенька, нужно будет завтра похлопотать, чтобы в эту комнату хоть на время поставить мебель». Ввечеру подавался на стол очень щегольской подсвечник из темной бронзы с тремя античными грациями, с перламутным щегольским щитом, и рядом с ним ставился какой-то просто медный инвалид, хромой, свернувшийся на сторону и весь в сале, хотя этого не замечал ни хозяин, ни хозяйка, ни слуги. Жена его… впрочем, они были совершенно довольны друг другом. Несмотря на то что минуло более восьми лет их супружеству, из них все еще каждый приносил другому или кусочек яблочка, или конфетку, или орешек и говорил трогательно-нежным голосом, выражавшим совершенную любовь: «Разинь, душенька, свой ротик, я тебе положу этот кусочек». Само собою разумеется, что ротик раскрывался при этом случае очень грациозно.","God alone could not say what the character of Manilov was. There is a kind of people known by the name: people are so-so, neither this nor that, neither in the city of Bogdan nor in the village of Selifan, according to the proverb. Perhaps Manilov should join them. In appearance he was a prominent person; his features were not devoid of pleasantness, but this pleasantness, it seemed, was too transferred to sugar; in his manners and turns there was something ingratiating himself with favors and acquaintances. He smiled enticingly, was blond, with blue eyes. In the first minute of a conversation with him, you can’t help but say: “What a pleasant and kind person!” In the next minute you will say nothing, and in the third you will say: “The devil knows what it is!” - and move away if you do not move away, you will feel bored to death. You will not expect any lively or even arrogant word from him, which you can hear from almost anyone if you touch the subject that torments him. Everyone has his own enthusiasm: one has turned his enthusiasm to greyhounds; to another it seems that he is a strong lover of music and surprisingly feels all the deep places in it; the third is a master of famously dine; the fourth to play a role at least one inch higher than the one assigned to him; the fifth, with a more limited desire, sleeps and dreams about how to go on a walk with the adjutant wing, showing off to his friends, acquaintances and even strangers; the sixth is already gifted with such a hand that feels a supernatural desire to break the corner of some diamond ace or deuce, while the hand of the seventh climbs somewhere to put things in order, to get closer to the personality of the stationmaster or coachmen - in a word, everyone has his own, but Manilov had nothing. At home he spoke very little and for the most part reflected and thought, but what he thought about, too, God only knew. It cannot be said that he was engaged in farming, he never even went to the fields, farming somehow went on by itself. When the clerk said: ""It would be nice, sir, to do this and that,"" - ""Yes, not bad,"" he usually answered, smoking a pipe, which he made a habit of smoking when he still served in the army, where he was considered the most modest, most delicate and most educated officer . “Yes, it’s not bad,” he repeated. When a peasant came to him and, scratching the back of his head with his hand, said: “Master, let me go to work, give me some money,” “Go,” he said, smoking a pipe, and it didn’t even enter his head that the peasant was going to get drunk. Sometimes, looking from the porch at the yard and at the pond, he would talk about how nice it would be if all of a sudden to lead an underground passage from the house or build a stone bridge across the pond, on which there would be benches on both sides, and so that people would sit in them. merchants and sold various small goods needed by the peasants. At the same time, his eyes became extremely sweet and his face assumed the most contented expression; however, all these projects ended in only one word. In his study there was always some kind of book, bookmarked on the fourteenth page, which he had been constantly reading for two years. Something was always missing in his house: in the living room there was beautiful furniture, upholstered in smart silk fabric, which, no doubt, was very expensive; but it was not enough for two armchairs, and the armchairs were upholstered simply with matting; however, for several years the host warned his guest every time with the words: ""Do not sit on these chairs, they are not yet ready."" In another room there was no furniture at all, although it was said in the first days after the marriage: ""Darling, you will have to work tomorrow to put furniture in this room at least for a while."" In the evening, a very smart candlestick made of dark bronze with three antique graces, with a mother-of-pearl smart shield, was served on the table, and next to it was placed some kind of simply copper invalid, lame, curled up on the side and covered in fat, although neither the owner nor mistress, no servant. His wife ... however, they were perfectly pleased with each other. Despite the fact that more than eight years of their marriage had passed, each of them still brought to the other either a piece of an apple, or a candy, or a nut and said in a touchingly tender voice expressing perfect love: “Open up your mouth, darling, I’ll put this a piece"". It goes without saying that the mouth opened very gracefully on this occasion.","God alone could say what Manilov’s character was like. There are people who are always spoken of as being “so-so,” neither one thing nor the other, neither flesh, fowl, nor good red herring, as the saying is. Possibly Manilov must be included in their number. In appearance, he was good-looking; the features of his countenance were rather agreeable, but in that agreeableness there was an overdose of sugar; in his deportment and manners there was something that betrayed an anxiety to win goodwill and friendship. He smiled ingratiatingly, he had fair hair and blue eyes. At the first moment of conversation with him one could not but say, “What a kind and agreeable man!”The next minute one would say nothing, and the third minute one would say, “What the devil is one to make of it?” and would walk away; if one did not walk away one would be aware of a deadly boredom. You would never hear from him a hasty or even over-eager word, such as you may hear from almost any one if you touch on a subject that upsets him. Every one has his weak spot: in one man it takes the form of hounds, another imagines that he is a great amateur of music and has a wonderful feeling for its inmost depths; a third is proud of his feats at the dining-table. A fourth is for playing a part if only one inch higher than that allotted him by fate; a fifth with more limited aspirations, dreams waking and sleeping of being seen on the promenade with a court adjutant to the admiration of his friends and acquaintances, and of strangers, too, indeed; a sixth is endowed with a hand which feels a supernatural prompting to turn down the corner of an ace of diamonds or of a two, while a seventh positively itches to maintain discipline everywhere and to enforce his views on station-masters and cabmen. In short every one has some peculiarity, but Manilov had nothing. At home he spoke very little, and for the most part confined himself to meditation and thought, but what he thought about, that too, God only knows. It could not be said that he busied himself in looking after his land, he never even drove out into the fields; the estate looked after itself somehow. When the steward said, “It would be a good thing to do this or that, sir,” “Yes, it would not be amiss,” he would usually reply, smoking his pipe, a habit he had taken to while he was in the army, in which he was considered a most modest, refined, and highly-cultured officer. “Yes, it certainly would not be amiss,” he would repeat. When a peasant came to him and, scratching the back of his head, said, “Master, give me leave of absence to earn money for my taxes,” “You can go,” he would say, smoking his pipe, and it would never enter his head that the peasant was going for a drinking-bout. Sometimes, looking from the steps into the yard or at the pond, he would say how nice it would be to make an underground passage from the house, or build a bridge over the pond with stalls on each side of it and shopmen sitting in them, selling all sorts of small articles of use to the peasants. And as he did so, his eyes would become extraordinarily sugary, and an expression of the greatest satisfaction would come into his face. All these projects ended in nothing but words, however. In his study there always lay a book with a marker at the fourteenth page, which he had been reading for the last two years. In his home something was always lacking: in the drawing-room there was excellent furniture upholstered in smart silken material which had certainly cost a good price, but there had not been enough of it to cover everything and two of the easy-chairs had remained simply swathed in sacking. The master of the house had been for some years past in the habit of warning his guests, “Don’t sit on those armchairs, they are not finished yet.” In some of the rooms there was no furniture at all, although in the early days after their marriage he had said to his wife: “To-morrow, my love, we must see about putting some furniture into those rooms if only for a time.” In the evening a very handsome candlestick of dark bronze with antique figures of the three Gracesw and an elegant mother-of-pearl shield was put on the table, and beside it was set a humble copper relic, unsteady on its legs and always covered with tallow, though this never attracted the notice of the master of the house, the mistress, or the servants. His wife was... however they were thoroughly satisfied with each other. Although they had been married over eight years they would still each offer the other a piece of apple or a sweet or a nut, and say in a touchingly tender voice expressive of the most perfect devotion: “Open your little mouth, my love, and I will pop it in.” It need hardly be said that on such occasions the little mouth was gracefully opened.","Only God can say what Manilov’s real character was. A class of men exists whom the proverb has described as “men unto themselves, neither this nor that—neither Bogdan of the city nor Selifan of the village.” And to that class we had better assign also Manilov. Outwardly he was presentable enough, for his features were not wanting in amiability, but that amiability was a quality into which there entered too much of the sugary element, so that his every gesture, his every attitude, seemed to connote an excess of eagerness to curry favour and cultivate a closer acquaintance. On first speaking to the man, his ingratiating smile, his flaxen hair, and his blue eyes would lead one to say, “What a pleasant, good-tempered fellow he seems!” yet during the next moment or two one would feel inclined to say nothing at all, and, during the third moment, only to say, “The devil alone knows what he is!” And should, thereafter, one not hasten to depart, one would inevitably become overpowered with the deadly sense of ennui which comes of the intuition that nothing in the least interesting is to be looked for, but only a series of wearisome utterances of the kind which are apt to fall from the lips of a man whose hobby has once been touched upon. For every man HAS his hobby. One man’s may be sporting dogs; another man’s may be that of believing himself to be a lover of music, and able to sound the art to its inmost depths; another’s may be that of posing as a connoisseur of recherche cookery; another’s may be that of aspiring to play roles of a kind higher than nature has assigned him; another ’s ( though this is a more limited ambition) may be that of getting drunk, and of dreaming that he is edifying both his friends, his acquaintances, and people with whom he has no connection at all by walking arm-in-arm with an Imperial aide-de-camp; another’s may be that of possessing a hand able to chip corners off aces and deuces of diamonds; another’s may be that of yearning to set things straight—in other words, to approximate his personality to that of a stationmaster or a director of posts. In short, almost every man has his hobby or his leaning; yet Manilov had none such, for at home he spoke little, and spent the greater part of his time in meditation—though God only knows what that meditation comprised! Nor can it be said that he took much interest in the management of his estate, for he never rode into the country, and the estate practically managed itself. Whenever the bailiff said to him, “It might be well to have such-and-such a thing done,” he would reply, “Yes, that is not a bad idea,” and then go on smoking his pipe—a habit which he had acquired during his service in the army, where he had been looked upon as an officer of modesty, delicacy, and refinement. “Yes, it is NOT a bad idea,” he would repeat. Again, whenever a peasant approached him and, rubbing the back of his neck, said “Barin, may I have leave to go and work for myself, in order that I may earn my obrok 9?” he would snap out, with pipe in mouth as usual, “Yes, go!” and never trouble his head as to whether the peasant’s real object might not be to go and get drunk. True, at intervals he would say, while gazing from the verandah to the courtyard, and from the courtyard to the pond, that it would be indeed splendid if a carriage drive could suddenly materialise, and the pond as suddenly become spanned with a stone bridge, and little shops as suddenly arise whence pedlars could dispense the petty merchandise of the kind which peasantry most need. And at such moments his eyes would grow winning, and his features assume an expression of intense satisfaction. Yet never did these projects pass beyond the stage of debate. Likewise there lay in his study a book with the fourteenth page permanently turned down. It was a book which he had been reading for the past two years! In general, something seemed to be wanting in the establishment. For instance, although the drawing-room was filled with beautiful furniture, and upholstered in some fine silken material which clearly had cost no inconsiderable sum, two of the chairs lacked any covering but bast, and for some years past the master had been accustomed to warn his guests with the words, “Do not sit upon these chairs; they are not yet ready for use.” Another room contained no furniture at all, although, a few days after the marriage, it had been said: “ My dear, to-morrow let us set about procuring at least some TEMPORARY furniture for this room.” Also, every evening would see placed upon the drawing-room table a fine bronze candelabrum, a statuette representative of the Three Graces, a tray inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and a rickety, lop-sided copper invalide. Yet of the fact that all four articles were thickly coated with grease neither the master of the house nor the mistress nor the servants seemed to entertain the least suspicion. At the same time, Manilov and his wife were quite satisfied with each other. More than eight years had elapsed since their marriage, yet one of them was for ever offering his or her partner a piece of apple or a bonbon or a nut, while murmuring some tender something which voiced a whole-hearted affection. “Open your mouth, dearest”—thus ran the formula—“and let me pop into it this titbit.” You may be sure that on such occasions the “dearest mouth” parted its lips most graciously!","God alone perhaps could tell what Manilov’s character was. There is a sort of people known by the name of so-so people, neither this nor that, neither Tom of the hill nor Jack of the mill, as the saying goes. It may be that Manilov ought to be put with them. He was a fine man to look at; the features of his face were not lacking in agreeableness, but this agreeableness had, it seemed, too much sugar in it; his ways and manners had about them a certain currying of favor and friendship. He smiled enticingly, was fair-haired, had blue eyes. At the first moment of conversation with him, you cannot help saying: “What an agreeable and kindly man!” The next moment you do not say anything, and the third moment you say: “Devil knows what this is!”—and walk away; or, if you do not walk away, you feel a deadly boredom. You will never get from him any sort of lively or even merely provoking word, such as can be heard from almost anyone, if you touch upon a subject that grips him. Everyone is gripped by something: for one it is borzoi hounds; another fancies himself a great lover of music and wonderfully sensitive to all its profundities; a third is an expert in hearty meals; a fourth in playing a role at least an inch above the one assigned him; a fifth, of more limited desires, sleeps and dreams of taking a stroll with an aide-de-camp, showing off in front of his friends, acquaintances, even non-acquaintances; a sixth is gifted with the sort of hand that feels a supernatural desire to turn down the corner of some ace or deuce of diamonds, while the hand of a seventh is simply itching to establish order somewhere, to get closer to the person of some stationmaster or cabdriver—in short, each has his own, but Manilov had nothing. At home he spoke very little and for the most part reflected and thought, but what he thought about, again, God only knows. One could not say he was occupied with management, he never even went out to the fields, the management somehow took care of itself. When the steward said: “Might be a good thing, master, to do such and such.” “Yes, not bad,” he would usually reply, smoking his pipe—a habit he had formed while still serving in the army, where he had been considered a most modest, most delicate, and most educated officer. “Yes, indeed, not bad,” he would repeat. When a muzhik came to him and, scratching the back of his head, said: “Master, give me leave to go and work, so I can pay my taxes,” “ Go,” he would say, smoking his pipe, and it would never even enter his head that the muzhik was going on a binge. Sometimes, as he gazed from the porch at the yard and pond, he would talk about how good it would be suddenly to make an underground passage from the house, or to build a stone bridge across the pond, and have shops on both sides of it, and shopkeepers sitting in the shops selling all sorts of small goods needed by peasants. At that his eyes would become exceedingly sweet and his face would acquire a most contented expression; however, all these projects ended only in words. In his study there was always some book lying, with a bookmark at the fourteenth page, which he had been reading constantly for the past two years. In his house something was eternally lacking: fine furniture stood in the drawing room, upholstered in stylish silk fabric, which must have been far from inexpensive; but there had not been enough for two of the armchairs, and so these armchairs were left upholstered in simple burlap; however, for several years the host had cautioned his guests each time with the words: “Don’t sit on these armchairs, they’re not ready yet.” In some rooms there was no furniture at all, though it had been said in the first days of their marriage: “Sweetie, we must see to it that furniture is put in this room tomorrow, at least for the time being.” In the evening a very stylish candlestick was placed on the table, made of dark bronze with the three Graces of antiquity and a stylish mother-of-pearl shield, while next to it was set some sort of plain copper invalid, lame, hunched over on one side, all covered with tallow, though this was noticed neither by the master, nor by the mistress, nor by the servants. His wife … however, they were perfectly satisfied with each other. Though it was already eight years since their wedding, they would still bring each other a little bit of apple, a piece of candy, or a nut, and say in a touchingly tender voice expressive of perfect love: “Open up your little mouth, sweetie, I’ll put this tidbit in for you.” Needless to say, the little mouth would on these occasions be very gracefully opened.","God alone, perhaps, could tell what sort of character Manilov’s was. There is a species of men labeled as so-so, neither here nor there, or, in the words of the proverb, neither fish nor flesh nor good red herring. Perhaps Manilov ought to be included in their number as well. He was a handsome man, to look at him; the features of his face were not devoid of amiability, but there was apparently far too great an overdose of sugariness about it; in his ways and turns of speech there was something that wheedled for your good graces and friendship. He smiled ingratiatingly and was blond in an ashy sort of way, with blue eyes. During the first minute or so of a conversation with him you could not but say: “What a pleasant and kindhearted man!” The minute after that you would not say anything at all, while the third minute you would say, “The Devil knows what’s going on here!” and walk away as far as ever you could; if you didn’t, you’d feel a deathly spell of the blues coming on. You could not, no matter how long you bided your time, ever get an eager word out of him, or even a challenging one, for that matter, such as you may hear from almost anybody should you broach a matter that touches him to the quick. Every man has his own enthusiasm: one’s enthusiasm is turned to wolfhounds; to another it seems that he is a great lover of music and amazingly sensitive to all its profound passages; a third may be a great hand at putting away a huge dinner; a fourth feels that he can play a better part in this world, even though that part be but a fraction above the one assigned to him; a fifth fellow, whose aspiration is more circumscribed, sleeps and dreams of how he might promenade on a gala occasion with some aide-de-camp, showing off before his friends, his acquaintances, and even those who aren’t acquainted with him; a sixth may be gifted with a hand that feels a preternatural urge to bet big on an ace or deuce of diamonds, say; while the hand of a seventh simply itches to set things to rights wherever he may happen to be, to get under the skin of a stationmaster or of a coachman. In short, everyone has something all his own, but Manilov didn’t have a thing. At home he spoke very little and for the most part gave himself up to meditation and thought, but what he thought was, likewise, known only to God—maybe. It could not be said that he busied himself about the estate—he never so much as drove out into the fields; the estate got along of its own accord, somehow. When his steward would tell him: “It might be a good thing, master, to do so and so,” he would usually answer, “Yes, that’s not a bad idea,” as he puffed away at his pipe, pipe smoking being a habit he had formed at the time he had served in the army, where he had been considered the most modest, the most considerate, and the best educated of officers. “Yes, just so, that’s not a bad idea,” he would repeat. When some muzhik would come to him and, scratching the nape of his neck, would say: “Master, give me leave from my work, so’s I can earn enough for the taxes,”—“Go ahead,” he would say, puffing away at his pipe, and it never even entered his head that the muzhik was going off on a bender. At times, as he looked down from the front porch on the courtyard and the pond, he would get to talking of what a good thing it would be if one were to up and tunnel an underground passage leading out of the house, or build a stone bridge across the pond, on both sides of which there would be shops, and have merchants sitting therein and selling all sorts of small wares that the peasants needed. As he spoke thus his eyes would become exceedingly sweet, while his face assumed the most contented expression. These projects ended, after all, with mere talk. In his study there was always some book lying about, with a bookmark on page 14, which he had been steadily reading for two years by now. There was perpetually something lacking about his house: the furniture in the dining room was splendid, upholstered with the smartest of silk materials, which had certainly cost quite a bit; but there had not been enough of it for two of the easy chairs, and those two chairs stood there upholstered in ordinary matting; however, the master, for several years at a stretch, kept warning every guest with the words: “Don’t sit down on those chairs; they aren’t ready yet.” In some of the rooms there was no furniture whatsoever, even though there had been talk of it during the first days after his marriage: “We’ll have to see to it tomorrow, my pet, and have some furniture placed in this room, if only temporarily.” In the evening an exceedingly exquisite candlestick of patinated bronze, with the three Graces of antiquity and an exquisite escutcheon of mother-of-pearl, would be brought in and placed on the table, and right alongside of it would be put some invalid of common copper, lame, twisted all to one side, and covered all over with winding sheets of tallow; the incongruity of this, however, struck neither the master of the house, nor its mistress, nor the servants. His wife . . . however, they were perfectly content with each other. Despite the fact that more than eight years had elapsed since their marriage, each one of them still kept bringing to the other either a slice of apple, or a bonbon, or a nut, and would say in a touchingly tender voice that expressed perfect love: “Open your little mouth wide, dearest, and let me put this tidbit in it.” It goes without saying that the little mouth was on such an occasion opened very gracefully."

Барин тут же велел Петрушке выдвинуть из-под кровати чемодан, покрывшийся уже порядочно пылью, и принялся укладывать вместе с ним, без большого разбора, чулки, рубашки, белье мытое и немытое, сапожные колодки, календарь… Все это укладывалось как попало; он хотел непременно быть готовым с вечера, чтобы назавтра не могло случиться никакой задержки. Селифан, постоявши минуты две у дверей, наконец очень медленно вышел из комнаты. Медленно, как только можно вообразить себе медленно, спускался он с лестницы, отпечатывая своими мокрыми сапогами следы по сходившим вниз избитым ступеням, и долго почесывал у себя рукою в затылке. Что означало это почесыванье? и что вообще оно значит? Досада ли на то, что вот не удалась задуманная назавтра сходка с своим братом в неприглядном тулупе, опоясанном кушаком, где-нибудь во царевом кабаке, или уже завязалась в новом месте какая зазнобушка сердечная и приходится оставлять вечернее стоянье у ворот и политичное держанье за белы ручки в тот час, как нахлобучиваются на город сумерки, детина в красной рубахе бренчит на балалайке перед дворовой челядью и плетет тихие речи разночинный отработавшийся народ? Или просто жаль оставлять отогретое уже место на людской кухне под тулупом, близ печи, да щей с городским мягким пирогом, с тем чтобы вновь тащиться под дождь, и слякоть, и всякую дорожную невзгоду? Бог весть, не угадаешь. Многое разное значит у русского народа почесыванье в затылке.","He tried to sell Nozdryov as soon as possible, summoned Selifan to him at the same hour and ordered him to be ready at dawn, so that tomorrow at six o'clock in the morning he would certainly leave the city, so that everything could be reviewed, the britzka was greased, and so on and so forth. Selifan said: ""I'm listening, Pavel Ivanovich!"" - and stopped, however, for some time at the door, without moving from his place. The master immediately ordered Petrushka to pull the suitcase out from under the bed, which was already covered with a fair amount of dust, and began to pack with it, indiscriminately, stockings, shirts, washed and unwashed linen, shoe lasts, a calendar ... All this fit in any way; he wanted to be absolutely ready in the evening, so that there could be no delay the next day. Selifan, after standing for two minutes at the door, finally left the room very slowly. Slowly, as slowly as one can imagine, he descended the stairs, making footprints with his wet boots on the battered steps descending, and for a long time scratched the back of his head with his hand. What did this scratching mean? and what does it mean anyway? Is it annoyance that the meeting planned for the next day with his brother in an unsightly sheepskin coat, girded with a sash, somewhere in the Tsar's tavern, somewhere in the Tsar's tavern, has not succeeded, or some kind of hearty sweetheart has already begun in a new place and you have to leave the evening standing at the gate and political holding on to white pens at the hour when twilight is pressing on the city, a fellow in a red shirt is strumming a balalaika in front of the servants of the yard and weaving quiet speeches by the raznochinny spent people? Or is it just a pity to leave the already warmed place in the people's kitchen under a sheepskin coat, near the stove, giving cabbage soup with a city soft pie, in order to again drag yourself through the rain, and slush, and all sorts of hardships on the road? God knows, don't guess. Scratching in the back of the head means many different things among the Russian people.","He tried to get rid of Nozdryov as quickly as he could, at once sent for Selifan and told him to be ready at daybreak, so that they could leave the town at six o‘clock next morning without fail, to look over everything, see that the carriage was greased and so on, and so on. Selifan articulated, “Yes, Pavel Ivanovitch,” but remained for some minutes standing motionless at the door. Our hero bade Petrushka pull the portmanteau, by now thickly covered with dust, from under the bed and began packing indiscriminately stockings, shirts, under- linen washed and unwashed, boot trees, a calendar.... All this was packed anyhow: he wanted to make sure of being ready so that nothing could happen to detain him in the morning. Selifan after standing for two minutes at the door went slowly away. He went slowly, as slowly as possible downstairs, leaving traces of his wet boots on the steps worn hollow by long use, and he stood for a long time scratching the back of his head. What did that scratching signify? and what does it indicate as a rule? Was it a vexation at missing the meeting planned for the next day in some imperial tavern with a fellow coachman, clad in an unattractive sheepskin with a sash tied round the waist, or had some little affair of the heart developed in this new place, and had he to give up standing in the evenings at the gate and diplomatically holding white hands at the hour when twilight drops upon the town, when a lad in a red shirt twangs on the balalaika before the assembled house serfs, and working people of all sorts after their toil exchange quiet talk? Or was he simply sorry to leave the snug place he had made for himself under a sheepskin by the stove in the servants’ kitchen, and the cabbage soup with the tender little town-made pies, to go dragging again through the rain and the sleet and all the hardships of the road? God knows,—there is no guessing. Scratching the head signifies all manner of things among the Russian people.","Getting rid of Nozdrev as soon as he could, he sent for Selifan, and ordered him to be up at daybreak, in order to clean the britchka and to have everything ready for a start at six o’clock. Yet, though Selifan replied, “Very well, Paul Ivanovitch,” he hesitated awhile by the door. Next, Chichikov bid Petrushka get out the dusty portmanteau from under the bed, and then set to work to cram into it, pell-mell, socks, shirts, collars (both clean and dirty), boot trees, a calendar, and a variety of other articles. Everything went into the receptacle just as it came to hand, since his one object was to obviate any possible delay in the morning’s departure. Meanwhile the reluctant Selifan slowly, very slowly, left the room, as slowly descended the staircase (on each separate step of which he left a muddy foot-print), and, finally, halted to scratch his head. What that scratching may have meant no one could say; for, with the Russian populace, such a scratching may mean any one of a hundred things.","He got Nozdryov off his hands as quickly as he could, summoned Selifan at once, and told him to be ready at daybreak, so that the next day at six o’clock in the morning they could leave town without fail, and that everything should be looked over, the britzka greased, and so on and so forth. Selifan said, “Right, Pavel Ivanovich!” and nevertheless stood for some time by the door, not moving from the spot. The master at once told Petrushka to pull the trunk, already quite covered with dust, from under the bed, and together with him began to pack, without much sorting out, stockings, shirts, underwear washed and unwashed, boot trees, a calendar … All this was packed haphazardly; he wanted to be ready that evening without fail, so that no delay should occur the next day. Selifan, having stood for some two minutes by the door, finally walked very slowly out of the room. Slowly, as slowly as one could only imagine, he went down the stairs, stamping traces with his wet boots on the worn-down, descending steps, and for a long time he scratched the back of his head with his hand. What did this scratching mean? and what does it generally mean? Was it vexation that now the planned meeting next day with his chum in the unseemly sheepskin coat tied with a belt, somewhere in a pot-house, would not come off, or had some little heartthrob started already in the new place, and he had to abandon the evening standing by the gate and the politic holding of white hands, at the hour when twilight pulls its brim down over the town, a strapping lad in a red shirt is strumming his balalaika before the household servants, and people, having finished work, weave their quiet talk? Or was he simply sorry to leave his already warmed-up place in the servants’ kitchen, under a coat, next to the stove, and the cabbage soup with tender town-baked pies, and drag himself out again into the rain and sleet and all the adversities of the road? God knows, there’s no guessing. Many and various among the Russian people are the meanings of scratching one’s head.","He tried to get rid of Nozdrev as quickly as possible, then immediately called Selifan and ordered him to be ready at dawn, so that they might leave the town no later than six o’clock in the morning, without fail; he gave orders to have everything in the carriage looked over, to grease the wheels, and so on, and so on. Selifan said: “Yes, sir, Pavel Ivanovich,” but nevertheless lingered in the doorway for some time, without stirring from the spot. The master also issued immediate orders to Petrushka to drag the small trunk out from under the bed (it had gathered quite a coat of dust by now) and, with his assistance, began packing away, without being too particular, socks, linen (putting the clean and the soiled together), boot trees, a calendar----All this was put away just as it came to hand: he wanted to have everything ready that evening without fail, so that there might not be any delay on the morrow. Selifan, after lingering in the doorway for a couple of minutes, finally walked very slowly out of the room. Slowly, as slowly as one can possibly imagine, did he go down the stairs, leaving the imprint of his wet boots on the worn steps, and for a long while did he keep scratching away at the nape of his neck. What did this scratching signify? And what does it signify in general? Was it vexation that the meeting set for tomorrow with some brother muzhik in an unprepossessing broad-belted sheepskin jacket would not now come off in some tavern licensed by the Tsar? Or had he already started an affair in this new place with someone who had pierced him to the very heart, and now he would have to leave off standing of evenings near the gates, leave off a politic holding of white hands at that hour when, as soon as the town had pulled the cowl of dusk over it, some husky lad in a red blouse strums his balalaika before all the house help, and working folk of all callings chat quietly among themselves after the toil of the day? Or, simply, did it signify that it was a pity to leave a place that had already been warmed in the domestics’ quarters, under a sheepskin, near the oven, and cabbage soup served with a soft, city-made meat pie, only to go off anew out in the rain and the mire and all sorts of inclement weather that overtakes one out on the road? God knows—one cannot guess with certainty. Many and sundry are the things signified when the Russian folk scratch the napes of their necks."
"— Идите в комнаты! — сказала ключница, отворотившись и показав ему спину, запачканную мукою, с большой прорехою пониже.","— Go to the rooms! said the housekeeper, turning away and showing him her back, stained with flour, with a large hole at the bottom.","“I have business.” “Go indoors,” said the housekeeper, turning round and showing him her back, dusty with flour, and a big slit in her skirt.","“Then pray walk into the house,” the woman advised. Then she turned upon him a back that was smeared with flour and had a long slit in the lower portion of its covering.","“It’s business.” “Go in!” said the housekeeper, turning away and showing him her back, dusted with flour, with a big rip lower down.","“Go in the house!” said the housekeeper, turning around and showing him her back, soiled with flour and flaunting a great rent down below."
"Ноздрев был так оттолкнут с своими безе, что чуть не полетел на землю: от него все отступились и не слушали больше; но все же слова его о покупке мертвых душ были произнесены во всю глотку и сопровождены таким громким смехом, что привлекли внимание даже тех, которые находились в самых дальних углах комнаты. Эта новость так показалась странною, что все остановились с каким-то деревянным, глупо-вопросительным выражением. Чичиков заметил, что многие дамы перемигнулись между собою с какою-то злобною, едкою усмешкою и в выражении некоторых лиц показалось что-то такое двусмысленное, которое еще более увеличило это смущение. Что Ноздрев лгун отъявленный, это было известно всем, и вовсе не было в диковинку слышать от него решительную бессмыслицу; но смертный, право, трудно даже понять, как устроен этот смертный: как бы ни была пошла новость, но лишь бы она была новость, он непременно сообщит ее другому смертному, хотя бы именно для того только, чтобы сказать: «Посмотрите, какую ложь распустили!» — а другой смертный с удовольствием преклонит ухо, хотя после скажет сам: «Да это совершенно пошлая ложь, не стоящая никакого внимания!» — и вслед за тем сей же час отправится искать третьего смертного, чтобы, рассказавши ему, после вместе с ним воскликнуть с благородным негодованием: «Какая пошлая ложь!» И это непременно обойдет весь город, и все смертные, сколько их ни есть, наговорятся непременно досыта и потом признают, что это не стоит внимания и не достойно, чтобы о нем говорить.","Nozdryov was so repelled with his meringues that he almost fell to the ground: everyone stepped aside from him and did not listen anymore; but still his words about buying dead souls were uttered at the top of his voice and accompanied by such loud laughter that they attracted the attention of even those who were in the farthest corners of the room. This news seemed so strange that everyone stopped with a kind of wooden, stupidly questioning expression. Chichikov noticed that many of the ladies winked at each other with a kind of malicious, caustic grin, and in the expression of some faces there seemed something so ambiguous, which further increased this embarrassment. That Nozdryov was a notorious liar was known to everyone, and it was not at all unusual to hear decided nonsense from him; but it’s really hard for a mortal to even understand how this mortal works: no matter how the news goes, if only it is news, he will certainly tell it to another mortal, if only to say: “Look, what a lie disbanded!"" - and another mortal will gladly bow his ear, although after that he himself will say: “Yes, this is a completely vulgar lie, not worth any attention!” - and after that, at the same time, he will go to look for the third mortal, so that, having told him, afterward, together with him, exclaim with noble indignation: “What a vulgar lie!” And this will certainly go around the whole city, and all mortals, no matter how many there are, will surely talk their fill and then admit that it is not worth attention and not worthy to talk about it.","Nozdryov was so violently repulsed with his baisers that he was almost thrown to the floor. Every one drew away from him and would hear no more. But still what he had said about the purchase of dead souls had been uttered at the top of his voice and accompanied by such loud laughter that it had attracted the attention even of persons sitting at the furthest ends of the room. This piece of news was so astounding that it left every one with a sort of wooden, stupidly interrogative expression. Tchitchikov noticed that many of the ladies glanced at each other with a spiteful, sarcastic smile, and in the expression of several countenances there was something ambiguous which further increased his confusion. That Nozdryov was a desperate liar was a fact known to all, and there was nothing to be surprised at in hearing the wildest fabrication from him, but mortal man—it really is difficult to understand what mortal man is made of; however silly a piece of news may be, so long as it is news, every mortal immediately passes it on to another, if only to say: “Just think what lies people are putting about!” And the other mortal listens eagerly, though he too will say afterwards: “Yes, that’s a perfectly silly lie, not worth noticing!” And thereupon he sets off to look for a third mortal, in order that after telling the story he may exclaim with righteous indignation: “What a silly lie!” And it will certainly go the round of the whole town and all the inhabitants, every one of them, will discuss it till they are sick of it, and will then admit that it’s not worth noticing and too silly to think of.","And in his efforts to force upon Chichikov what he termed his “baisers” he came near to measuring his length upon the floor. Every one now edged away, and turned a deaf ear to his further babblings; but his words on the subject of the purchase of dead souls had none the less been uttered at the top of his voice, and been accompanied with such uproarious laughter that the curiosity even of those who had happened to be sitting or standing in the remoter corners of the room had been aroused. So strange and novel seemed the idea that the company stood with faces expressive of nothing but a dumb, dull wonder. Only some of the ladies (as Chichikov did not fail to remark) exchanged meaning, ill-natured winks and a series of sarcastic smiles: which circumstance still further increased his confusion. That Nozdrev was a notorious liar every one, of course, knew, and that he should have given vent to an idiotic outburst of this sort had surprised no one; but a dead soul—well, what was one to make of Nozdrev’s reference to such a commodity?","Nozdryov was pushed away with his baisers, so hard that he almost went sprawling on the floor: everyone left him and no longer listened to him; but all the same his words about the buying of dead souls had been uttered at the top of his voice and accompanied by such loud laughter that they had attracted the attention even of those in the farthest corners of the room. This news seemed so strange that everyone stopped with some sort of wooden, foolishly quizzical expression. Chichikov noticed that many of the ladies winked at each other with a sort of spiteful, caustic grin, and certain faces bore an expression of something so ambiguous that it further increased his confusion. That Nozdryov was an inveterate liar everyone knew, and there was no wonder at all in hearing decided balderdash from him; but mortal man—truly, it is hard to understand how your mortal man is made: however banal the news may be, as long as it is news, he will not fail to pass it on to some other mortal, even if it is precisely with the purpose of saying: “See what a lie they’re spreading!” and the other mortal will gladly incline his ear, though afterwards he himself will say: “Yes, that is a perfectly banal lie, not worthy of any attention!” and thereupon he will set out at once to look for a third mortal, so that, having told him, they can both exclaim with noble indignation: “What a banal lie!” And it will not fail to make the rounds of the whole town, and all mortals, however many there are, will have their fill of talking and will then admit that it is unworthy of attention and not worth talking about.","Nozdrev was pushed back so hard with his baisers that he was sent flying and all but fell to the floor. Everybody drew away from him and no one listened to him any more. But just the same his words about the buying up of dead souls had been uttered at the top of his voice and had been accompanied with such loud laughter that it had attracted the attention of even those who had been in the farthest corners of the room. This bit of news appeared so strange that all those present stopped still, with some wooden, foolishly questioning air. Chichikov noted that many of the ladies exchanged winks among themselves with malevolent, caustic smiles, and in the expression of certain faces there appeared a something so equivocal that it increased his confusion still more. That Nozdrev was an arrant liar everybody knew, and it wasn’t at all a rare thing to hear him spout downright nonsense; but mortal man .. . really, it is hard to comprehend how mortal man is fashioned: no matter how vulgar a bit of news may be, just as long as it be news he’ll inevitably impart it to some other mortal man, even though it be for no other purpose than to say: “Just see what a lie they’ve spread around!” And the other mortal man will with pleasure incline his ear, although he’ll say in his turn: “Yes, that’s a downright vulgar lie, unworthy of any attention whatsoever!” And right after that he won’t waste an instant setting out in search of a third mortal man, so that he may, after having retailed the story to him, exclaim in chorus with the latter in noble indignation: “What a vulgar lie!” And this story will inevitably make the rounds of the whole town, and all the mortal men, no matter how many of them there may be, will inevitably have their bellyful of talk, and then will admit that the matter doesn’t deserve any attention and isn’t even worth talking about."
"«Нет, — подумал Чичиков, — ты-то не много сделаешь толку с десятью миллионами. А вот если б мне десять миллионов, я бы, точно, кое-что сделал».","""No,"" thought Chichikov, ""you won't do much good with ten million. But if I had ten million, I would definitely do something.","“No,” thought Tchitchikov, “you wouldn’t do much good with ten millions. But if I were given ten millions, I really should do something.”","Chichikov scanned the speaker’s face, but could make nothing of it.","“No,” thought Chichikov, “you won’t do much that’s sensible with ten million.

No, not until I have learnt what all this purchasing of dead peasants means. Look here. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Yes, I say that—I who am one of your best friends.” Here he turned to the Governor again. “Your Excellency,” he continued, “you would never believe what inseperables this man and I have been. Indeed, if you had stood there and said to me, ‘Nozdrev, tell me on your honour which of the two you love best—your father or Chichikov?’ I should have replied, ‘Chichikov, by God!’” With that he tackled our hero again, “Come, come, my friend!” he urged. “Let me imprint upon your cheeks a baiser or two.

"— Однако ж нет, после этаких опытов…","- But no, after such experiments ...","“Well, after such experiences, though ...”","Poor Khlobuev could not utter a word in reply, and Murazov began to feel sorry for him.","“Not really, though, after such experience …”",
"К довершению этого, кричал кричмя дворовый ребятишка, получивший от матери затрещину; визжал борзой кобель, присев задом к земле, по поводу горячего кипятка, которым обкатил его, выглянувши из кухни, повар. Словом, все голосило и верещало невыносимо. Барин все видел и слышал. И только тогда, когда это делалось до такой степени несносно, что даже мешало барину ничем не заниматься, высылал он сказать, чтоб шумели потише.","To top it off, the yard kid shouted, shouting, having received a slap from his mother; the dog squealed like a greyhound, crouching back to the ground, about the hot boiling water that the cook had poured over him, looking out of the kitchen. In a word, everything was screaming and squealing unbearably. Barin saw and heard everything. And only when it was done to such an unbearable degree that it even prevented the master from doing nothing, did he send to say that they should be quieter.","To complete the picture, a brat whose mother had just boxed his ears, was screaming at the top of his voice, and a borzoi hound squatting on the ground whined pitifully, for the cook had just looked out of the kitchen and splashed it with scalding water; the hubbub and uproar were insufferable. Their master saw and heard it all and not till it became so unendurable that it even hindered him in doing nothing did he send to tell them to be a little quieter in their noise.","Next, to complete the hubbub, a serf child which had been clouted by its mother broke out into a bawl, while a borzoi puppy which had happened to get splashed with boiling water by the cook fell to yelping vociferously. In short, the place soon became a babel of shouts and squeals, and, after watching and listening for a time, the barin found it so impossible to concentrate his mind upon anything that he sent out word that the noise would have to be abated.","To crown it all, a house serf’s brat was yelling his head off, having received a whack from his mother; a borzoi hound was whimpering, crouched on the ground, for reason of being scalded with boiling hot water by the cook, who was peeking out from the kitchen. In short, everything was howling and squealing insufferably. The master could see and hear it all. And only when it became so unbearable that it even prevented the master from doing nothing, would he send to tell them to make their noise more quietly.",

"— В таком случае я поеду просто к генералу без причины, — сказал Чичиков.","""In that case, I'll just go to the general for no reason,"" said Chichikov.","“In that case I’ll simply go to the general’s without any reason,” said Tchitchikov.","“A strange fellow, this Tientietnikov!” thought Chichikov, and then added aloud: “Yes, I will go and see him at ten o’clock to-morrow; but since my britchka is not yet altogether in travelling order, would you be so good as to lend me your koliaska for the purpose?”","“In that case I’ll simply go to the general without any reason,” said Chichikov.",
"И трудолюбивая жизнь, удаленная от шума городов и тех обольщений, которые от праздности выдумал, позабывши труд, человек, так сильно стала перед ним рисоваться, что он уже почти позабыл всю неприятность своего положения и, может быть, готов был даже возблагодарить провиденье за этот тяжелый урок, если только выпустят его и отдадут хотя часть. Но… одностворчатая дверь его нечистого чулана растворилась, вошла чиновная особа — Самосвистов, эпикуреец, собой лихач, отличный товарищ, кутила и продувная бестия, как выражались о нем сами товарищи. В военное время человек этот наделал бы чудес: его бы послать куда-нибудь пробраться сквозь непроходимые, опасные места, украсть перед носом у самого неприятеля пушку, — это его бы дело. Но, за неимением военного поприща, на котором бы, может быть, он был честным человеком, он пакостил и гадил. Непостижимое дело! с товарищами он был хорош, никого не продавал и, давши слово, держал; но высшее над собою начальство он считал чем-то вроде неприятельской батареи, сквозь которую нужно пробиваться, пользуясь всяким слабым местом, проломом или упущением…","And the industrious life, remote from the noise of the cities and those seductions that, out of idleness, invented, having forgotten labor, a man began to draw before him so strongly that he almost forgot all the unpleasantness of his position and, perhaps, was ready even to thank Providence for this a hard lesson, if only they let it out and give at least a part of it. But ... the single-leaf door of his unclean closet opened, an official came in - Samosvistov, an Epicurean, a reckless driver, an excellent comrade, a reveler and a swindling beast, as the comrades themselves expressed it about him. In wartime, this man would have done wonders: if he had been sent somewhere to get through impassable, dangerous places, to steal a cannon from the very nose of the enemy, that would be his business. But, in the absence of a military field, in which, perhaps, he would be an honest man, he dirty and spoiled. Incredible business! he was good with his comrades, he did not sell anyone, and having given his word, he kept them; but he considered the superiors above him to be something like an enemy battery, through which you need to break through, taking advantage of every weak spot, gap or omission ...","And a life of toil, away from the noise of cities and from all the temptations that man has devised in his idleness, rose up before him in such vivid colours that he almost forgot all the horror of his position, and perhaps was even ready to thank providence for this bitter trial, if only they would release him, and let him have at least a part of his property. But ... the door of his filthy prison opened and there walked in a certain official, one Samosvitov, an epicure, a capital companion, a rake and a sly beast as his colleagues said of him. In time of war this man would have performed marvels: he would have been sent to make his way through impassable dangerous places, to steal a cannon from under the very nose of the enemy, that would have been the very task for him. But lacking a military career he had thrown his energies into civil life, and, instead of feats for which he would have been with good reason decorated, he did all sorts of nasty and abominable things. Incredible to relate, he was quite good to his comrades, he never sold them to any one, and when he had given a promise he kept it; but those in authority over him he regarded as something like the battery of the enemy through which he had to make his way, taking advantage of every weak spot or gap in their defences....","That is to say, dimly his instinct divined that every man has a duty to perform, and that that duty may be performed here, there, and everywhere, and no matter what the circumstances and the emotions and the difficulties which compass a man about. And with such clearness did Chichikov mentally picture to himself the life of grateful toil which lies removed from the bustle of towns and the temptations which man, forgetful of the obligation of labour, has invented to beguile an hour of idleness that almost our hero forgot his unpleasant position, and even felt ready to thank Providence for the calamity which had befallen him, provided that it should end in his being released, and in his receiving back a portion of his property. Presently the massive door of the cell opened to admit a tchinovnik named Samosvitov, a robust, sensual individual who was reputed by his comrades to be something of a rake. Had he served in the army, he would have done wonders, for he would have stormed any point, however dangerous and inaccessible, and captured cannon under the very noses of the foe; but, as it was, the lack of a more warlike field for his energies caused him to devote the latter principally to dissipation. Nevertheless he enjoyed great popularity, for he was loyal to the point that, once his word had been given, nothing would ever make him break it. At the same time, some reason or another led him to regard his superiors in the light of a hostile battery which, come what might, he must breach at any weak or unguarded spot or gap which might be capable of being utilised for the purpose.","And a life of labor, far removed from the noise of the cities and those seductions invented in his idleness by the man who has forgotten labor, began to picture itself to him so vividly that he almost forgot the whole unpleasantness of his situation, and was, perhaps, even ready to give thanks to Providence for this harsh lesson, if only he were let go and at least part of his money were returned to him. But … the single-leafed door of his unclean closet opened and in walked an official person—Samosvistov, an epicure, a daredevil, an excellent friend, a carouser, and a cunning beast, as his own friends called him. In time of war this man might have done wonders: if he had been sent to sneak through some impassable, dangerous places, to steal a cannon right out from under the enemy’s nose—it would have been just the thing for him. But, for lack of a military career in which he might have been an honest man, he did dirty and mucked things up. Inconceivably, he was good with his friends, never sold anyone, and, once he gave his word, he kept it; but his own superiors he regarded as something like an enemy battery which one had to make one’s way through, taking advantage of every weak spot, breach, or negligence …",

"— Нет, барин, нигде не видно! — После чего Селифан, помахивая кнутом, затянул песню не песню, но что-то такое длинное, чему и конца не было. Туда все вошло: все ободрительные и побудительные крики, которыми потчевают лошадей по всей России от одного конца до другого; прилагательные всех родов без дальнейшего разбора, как что первое попалось на язык. Таким образом дошло до того, что он начал называть их наконец секретарями.","- No, sir, nowhere to be seen! - After which Selifan, waving his whip, sang a song, not a song, but something so long that there was no end. Everything went in there: all the encouraging and motivating cries with which horses are regaled all over Russia from one end to the other; adjectives of all genders without further analysis as to what first came to mind. Thus it came to the point that he finally began to call them secretaries.","“No, master, there is nothing in sight anywhere!” After which Selifan, brandishing his whip, struck up—not precisely a song but a sort of long rigmarole without an ending. Everything went into it; all the calls of encouragement and incitement with which horses are regaled all over Russia from one end to the other, adjectives of all kinds without discrimination just as they came first to his tongue. It came at last to his beginning to call them secretaries.","“No, barin.” After which, with a flourish of the whip, the man broke into a sort of endless, drawling song. In that song everything had a place. By “everything” I mean both the various encouraging and stimulating cries with which Russian folk urge on their horses, and a random, unpremeditated selection of adjectives.","“No, master, it’s nowhere to be seen!” After which Selifan, brandishing his whip, struck up, not really a song, but something so long that there was even no end to it. Everything went into it: every inciting and inviting cry to which horses all over Russia, from one end to the other, are treated; adjectives of every sort without further discrimination, whatever came first to his tongue. In this fashion things reached a point where he finally started calling them secretaries.","“No, master, it’s nowheres in sight!” After which Selifan, swinging his whip from time to time, launched into a song—well, you couldn’t call it a song, exactly, but it was something so long drawn out that there was never an end to it. Anything and everything had gone into it: all the encouraging and urging cries which horses are regaled with all over Russia, from one end to the other; all sorts of adjectives without the least discrimination, but just as they came to the tip of his tongue. Thus things reached such a pass that he began to call his horses, at last, his “secretaries.”"

"— А я, признаюсь, как только вы открыли рот, я уже смекнула, в чем дело, — отвечала дама приятная во всех отношениях.","“And I, I confess, as soon as you opened your mouth, I already realized what was the matter,” answered the lady pleasant in every respect.","“But as soon as you opened your mouth, I saw what was in the wind,” answered the lady who was agreeable in all respects.","“Well, to tell you the truth, I guessed it as soon as ever you opened your mouth.”","“And, I confess, as soon as you opened your mouth, I grasped what it was,” replied the lady agreeable in all respects.","“But I, I confess, as soon as you opened your mouth, had already surmised what was what,” answered the lady who was agreeable in all respects."
"На такое рассуждение барин совершенно не нашелся, что отвечать. Но в это время, казалось, как будто сама судьба решилась над ним сжалиться. Издали послышался собачий лай. Обрадованный Чичиков дал приказание погонять лошадей. Русский возница имеет доброе чутье вместо глаз; от этого случается, что он, зажмуря глаза, качает иногда во весь дух и всегда куда-нибудь да приезжает. Селифан, не видя ни зги, направил лошадей так прямо на деревню, что остановился тогда только, когда бричка ударилась оглоблями в забор и когда решительно уже некуда было ехать. Чичиков только заметил сквозь густое покрывало лившего дождя что-то похожее на крышу. Он послал Селифана отыскивать ворота, что, без сомнения, продолжалось бы долго, если бы на Руси не было вместо швейцаров лихих собак, которые доложили о нем так звонко, что он поднес пальцы к ушам своим. Свет мелькнул в одном окошке и досягнул туманною струею до забора, указавши нашим дорожным ворота. Селифан принялся стучать, и скоро, отворив калитку, высунулась какая-то фигура, покрытая армяком, и барин со слугою услышали хриплый бабий голос:","To such a reasoning, the master could not at all find what to answer. But at that time, it seemed as if fate itself had decided to take pity on him. A dog barking was heard in the distance. Delighted, Chichikov gave the order to drive the horses. The Russian driver has a good instinct instead of eyes; from this it happens that, closing his eyes, he sometimes pumps at the top of his lungs and always arrives somewhere. Selifan, not seeing a thing, sent the horses so straight at the village that he only stopped when the britzka hit the fence with the shafts, and when there was absolutely nowhere to go. Chichikov only noticed something resembling a roof through the thick cover of pouring rain. He sent Selifan to look for the gates, which, no doubt, would have gone on for a long time if in Russia there were not dashing dogs instead of porters, who announced him so loudly that he put his fingers to his ears. Light flickered in one window and reached the fence in a misty stream, indicating the gate to our travellers. Selifan began to knock, and soon, opening the gate, a figure leaned out, covered with a coat, and the master and the servant heard a hoarse woman's voice:","His master found absolutely no reply to make to this line of argument. But at that instant it seemed as though fate itself had determined to take pity on them. They heard a dog barking in the distance. Tchitchikov, overjoyed, told Selifan to whip up the horses. The Russian driver has a keen scent that takes the place of his eyes; that is how it is he jolts along at full speed with his eyes shut and always arrives somewhere in the end. Though Selifan could not see his hand before his face, he drove the horses so straight to the village that he didn’t stop till the shafts of the chaise struck against a fence and he could absolutely drive no further. All Tchitchikov could discern through the thick curtain of streaming rain was something that looked like a roof. He sent Selifan to seek for the gate, an operation which would undoubtedly have taken a long time if it were not that in Russia ferocious dogs do duty for house-porters, and these proclaimed its whereabouts so loudly that he put his fingers into his ears. There was a gleam of light in one little window which sent a misty glimmer as far as the fence and showed our travellers the gate. Selifan fell to knocking and soon a figure clad in a smock was thrust out at the gate, and the master and his servant heard a husky female voice ask: “Who is knocking?","This reasoning seemed, at the moment, irrefutable, and Chichikov said nothing more. Fortunately fate had decided to take pity on the pair, for from afar their ears caught the barking of a dog. Plucking up courage, Chichikov gave orders for the britchka to be righted, and the horses to be urged forward; and since a Russian driver has at least this merit, that, owing to a keen sense of smell being able to take the place of eyesight, he can, if necessary, drive at random and yet reach a destination of some sort, Selifan succeeded, though powerless to discern a single object, in directing his steeds to a country house near by, and that with such a certainty of instinct that it was not until the shafts had collided with a garden wall, and thereby made it clear that to proceed another pace was impossible, that he stopped. All that Chichikov could discern through the thick veil of pouring rain was something which resembled a verandah. So he dispatched Selifan to search for the entrance gates, and that process would have lasted indefinitely had it not been shortened by the circumstance that, in Russia, the place of a Swiss footman is frequently taken by watchdogs; of which animals a number now proclaimed the travellers’ presence so loudly that Chichikov found himself forced to stop his ears. Next, a light gleamed in one of the windows, and filtered in a thin stream to the garden wall—thus revealing the whereabouts of the entrance gates; whereupon Selifan fell to knocking at the gates until the bolts of the house door were withdrawn and there issued therefrom a figure clad in a rough cloak.","The master was completely at a loss how to respond to such reasoning. But at that time it seemed as if fate itself decided to have mercy on him. From far off came the barking of dogs. Overjoyed, Chichikov gave the order to whip up the horses. A Russian driver has good instinct in place of eyes; as a result, he sometimes goes pumping along at full speed, eyes shut, and always gets somewhere or other. Selifan, without seeing a blessed thing, aimed his horses so directly at the estate that he stopped only when the britzka’s shafts struck the fence and there was decidedly no way to go further. Chichikov only noticed through the thick sheet of pouring rain something resembling a roof. He sent Selifan in search of the gates, which no doubt would have taken a long time, were it not that in Russia, instead of gatekeepers, there are brave dogs, who announced him so ringingly that he put his fingers in his ears. Light flickered in one little window and its misty stream reached the fence, showing our travelers the gates. Selifan set about knocking, and soon some figure clad in a smock stuck itself out the wicket, and master and servant heard a husky female voice:","To such reasoning the master was utterly at a loss for an answer. But at this juncture it seemed as if fate itself had decided to have compassion upon him: barking was heard in the distance. Chichikov, heartened thereby, ordered the coachman to give the horses the whip. The Russian driver has a good scent which he uses instead of eyes; it is because of this that there are occasions when, shutting his eyes tight, he will merely jolt along with might and main yet will always fetch up somewhere in the end. Selifan, without seeing a thing, set his horses in such a straight line for the village that he stopped only when the shafts of the carriage ran right up against a fence and there was absolutely nowhere else to drive. The only thing Chichikov observed through the thick pall of the driving rain was something that resembled a roof. He sent Selifan off to seek out the gate, a search that beyond a doubt would have lasted for a long time if, in Russia, in place of doormen, savage dogs were not employed, who announced him so resonantly that he had to stick his fingers into his ears. A light gleamed in a small window and reached in a misty beam to the fence, indicating the gates to our wayfarers. Selifan took to hammering upon them and in a short while some sort of figure, swathed in a drab peasant overcoat, opened a wicket and thrust itself out from it, and the master and his serving man heard a countrywife’s hoarse voice: “Who’s that knocking there?"

"— Мило, Анна Григорьевна, до невероятности; шьется в два рубчика: широкие проймы и сверху… Но вот, вот когда вы изумитесь, вот уж когда скажете, что… Ну, изумляйтесь: вообразите, лифчики пошли еще длиннее, впереди мыском, и передняя косточка совсем выходит из границ; юбка вся собирается вокруг, как, бывало, в старину фижмы, даже сзади немножко подкладывают ваты, чтобы была совершенная бель-фам.[20]","- Cute, Anna Grigorievna, to the point of improbability; it is sewn in two ribs: wide armholes and on top ...

Only a person of the unhumanity of a “true friend” would have had the heart to interrupt her; but the hostess was just such a friend, and at once interposed with: “I wonder how any one can see anything in the man to praise or to admire.","“It’s sweet, Anna Grigorievna, unbelievably sweet. It’s made with double seams: wide armholes and above … But here, here is something amazing for you, now you’re going to say … Well, be amazed: imagine, the bodices are even longer now, vee-shaped in front, and the front busk goes beyond all bounds; the skirt is gathered around as it used to be with the old-fashioned farthingale, and they even pad it out a little behind with cotton batting, so as to make for a perfect belle-femme.”","“It’s darling, Anna Grigorievna, you’d hardly believe how darling it is: you sew them in two ruchings, with wide armholes, and then, on top . ..

"— Это, однако ж, странно, — сказала во всех отношениях приятная дама, — что бы такое могли значить эти мертвые души? Я, признаюсь, тут ровно ничего не понимаю.

I confess I don't understand anything here. This is the second time I've heard about these dead souls; and my husband still says that Nozdryov is lying; there is something, that's for sure.","“It certainly is odd,” said the lady agreeable in all respects. “What can be the meaning of these dead souls? I can’t make it out, I must own.

True, my husband avers that Nozdrev was lying; yet in his lies there seems to have been a grain of truth.”","“It is strange, though,” said the lady agreeable in all respects. “What might they mean, these dead souls? I confess, I understand precisely nothing of it. It’s the second time I’ve heard about these dead souls; but my husband still says Nozdryov’s lying. No, there must be something to it.”","how upset I became over all this!” “This is quite bizarre, though,” said the lady who was agreeable in all respects. “What in the world could these dead souls signify? I understand precisely nothing of all this, I must confess.

"Наконец бричка, сделавши порядочный скачок, опустилась, как будто в яму, в ворота гостиницы, и Чичиков был встречен Петрушкою, который одною рукою придерживал полу своего сюртука, ибо не любил, чтобы расходились полы, а другою стал помогать ему вылезать из брички. Половой тоже выбежал, со свечою в руке и салфеткою на плече. Обрадовался ли Петрушка приезду барина, неизвестно, по крайней мере, они перемигнулись с Селифаном, и обыкновенно суровая его наружность на этот раз как будто несколько прояснилась.","Finally, the britzka, having made a decent leap, sank, as if into a pit, at the gates of the hotel, and Chichikov was met by Petrushka, who with one hand held the hem of his coat, for he did not like the hem to part, and with the other began to help him get out of the britzka. The floorman also ran out, with a candle in his hand and a napkin on his shoulder. Whether Petrushka was delighted at the arrival of the master, it is not known, at least they exchanged winks with Selifan, and this time his usually stern appearance seemed to clear up somewhat.","At last the chaise with a violent jolt seemed to drop into a hole, as it passed in at the gates of the hotel, and Tchitchikov was met by Petrushka, who with one hand held the skirts of his coat, for he could not bear them to fly apart, and with the other began helping his master out of the chaise. The waiter ran out with a candle in his hand and a napkin over his shoulder. Whether Petrushka was pleased at his master’s arrival no one can tell; anyway, Selifan and he winked at each other, and his usually sullen countenance seemed for a moment to brighten.","With one hand holding back the tails of his coat (which he never liked to see fly apart), the valet assisted his master to alight. The waiter ran out with candle in hand and napkin on shoulder. Whether or not Petrushka was glad to see the barin return it is impossible to say, but at all events he exchanged a wink with Selifan, and his ordinarily morose exterior seemed momentarily to brighten.","Finally, after a decent bounce, the britzka sank, as if into a hole, into the gates of the inn, and Chichikov was met by Petrushka, who held the skirts of his frock coat with one hand, for he did not like them to come open, and with the other began helping him to get out of the britzka. The floorboy also ran out with a candle in his hand and a napkin on his shoulder. Whether Petrushka was glad of his master’s arrival is not known; in any case, he exchanged winks with Selifan, and his ordinarily stern exterior this time seemed to brighten a little.","Finally the carriage, after a considerable bounce, plunged, as if it were sinking into a pit, into the gates of his inn, where Chichikov was met by his servant Petrushka, who held the skirts of his frock coat with one hand (inasmuch as he did not like having them come apart) and with the other helped his master to climb out of the carriage. The tavern servant, too, came running out with a candle and a napkin over his shoulder. Whether Petrushka was gladdened by the arrival of his master, no one knows; but at any rate he exchanged winks with Selifan, and his usual sullen air seemed on this occasion to clear up to some extent."

"Чичиков уверил ее, что не завезет, и Коробочка, успокоившись, уже стала рассматривать все, что было во дворе ее; вперила глаза на ключницу, выносившую из кладовой деревянную побратиму с медом, на мужика, показавшегося в воротах, и мало-помалу вся переселилась в хозяйственную жизнь. Но зачем так долго заниматься Коробочкой? Коробочка ли, Манилова ли, хозяйственная ли жизнь, или нехозяйственная — мимо их! Не то на свете дивно устроено: веселое мигом обратится в печальное, если только долго застоишься перед ним, и тогда бог знает что взбредет в голову. Может быть, станешь даже думать: да полно, точно ли Коробочка стоит так низко на бесконечной лестнице человеческого совершенствования? Точно ли так велика пропасть, отделяющая ее от сестры ее, недосягаемо огражденной стенами аристократического дома с благовонными чугунными лестницами, сияющей медью, красным деревом и коврами, зевающей за недочитанной книгой в ожидании остроумно-светского визита, где ей предстанет поле блеснуть умом и высказать вытверженные мысли, мысли, занимающие по законам моды на целую неделю город, мысли не о том, что делается в ее доме и в ее поместьях, запутанных и расстроенных благодаря незнанью хозяйственного дела, а о том, какой политический переворот готовится во Франции, какое направление принял модный католицизм. Но мимо, мимо! зачем говорить об этом? Но зачем же среди недумающих, веселых, беспечных минут сама собою вдруг пронесется иная чудная струя: еще смех не успел совершенно сбежать с лица, а уже стал другим среди тех же людей, и уже другим светом осветилось лицо…","Chichikov assured her that he would not deliver, and Korobochka, having calmed down, already began to examine everything that was in her yard; she fixed her eyes on the housekeeper, who was carrying a wooden brother with honey out of the pantry, on the peasant who appeared at the gate, and little by little she completely settled into economic life. But why do Korobochka so long? Is it a box, is it Manilov, is it an economic life, or an uneconomic one - past them! Otherwise, the world is wonderfully arranged: the merry will instantly turn into sadness, if you only stagnate in front of it for a long time, and then God knows what will come into your head. Maybe you will even begin to think: come on, does Korobochka really stand so low on the endless ladder of human perfection? How great is the abyss separating her from her sister, inaccessibly fenced by the walls of an aristocratic house with fragrant cast-iron stairs, shining copper, mahogany and carpets, yawning over an unfinished book in anticipation of a witty secular visit, where she will have a field to show off her mind and express her outspoken thoughts, thoughts that, according to the laws of fashion, occupy the city for a whole week, thoughts not about what is happening in her house and on her estates, confused and upset due to ignorance of economic affairs, but about what political upheaval is being prepared in France, what direction she has taken fashionable catholicism. But pass, pass! why talk about it? But why, in the midst of unthinking, merry, carefree minutes, would another wonderful stream suddenly rush by itself: laughter had not yet had time to completely escape from the face, but it had already become different among the same people, and the face was already lit up with a different light ...","Tchitchikov assured her that he would not carry off the girl, and Madame Korobotchka, reassured, began scanning everything that was going on in her yard. She stared at the housekeeper who was bringing a wooden tub of honey out of the storeroom, at a peasant who appeared at the gate, and, little by little, was completely re-absorbed in the life of her farm. But why spend so long over Madame Korobotchka? Enough of Madame Korobotchka and Madame Manilov, of their well-ordered or ill-ordered lives! Or—as it is so strangely ordained in this world—what is amusing will turn into being gloomy, if you stand too long before it, and then God knows what ideas may not stray into the mind. Perhaps one may even begin thinking: “But, after all, is Madame Korobotchka so low down on the endless ladder of human perfectibility?” Is there really such a vast chasm separating her from her sister, who, inaccessibly immured within the walls of her aristocratic house with its perfumed cast-iron staircases, its shining copper fittings, its mahogany and carpets, yawns over her unfinished book while she waits to pay her visits in witty fashionable society? There she has a field in which to display her intelligence and express the views she has learnt by heart—not ideas of her own, about her household and her estate, both neglected and in disorder, thanks to her ignorance of housekeeping and farming—but those opinions that by fashion’s decree interest the town for a whole week, ideas about the political revolution brewing in France and the tendencies of fashionable Catholicism. But enough, enough! Why talk of this? Why is it that even in moments of unthinking careless gaiety a different and strange mood suddenly comes upon one? The smile has scarcely faded from the lips when, even among the same people, one is suddenly another man and already the face shines with a different light.","Chichikov reassured his hostess on the point, and Madame plucked up courage enough to scan, first of all, the housekeeper, who happened to be issuing from the storehouse with a bowl of honey, and, next, a young peasant who happened to be standing at the gates; and, while thus engaged, she became wholly absorbed in her domestic pursuits. But why pay her so much attention? The Widow Korobotchka, Madame Manilov, domestic life, non-domestic life—away with them all! How strangely are things compounded! In a trice may joy turn to sorrow, should one halt long enough over it: in a trice only God can say what ideas may strike one. You may fall even to thinking: “After all, did Madame Korobotchka stand so very low in the scale of human perfection? Was there really such a very great gulf between her and Madame Manilov—between her and the Madame Manilov whom we have seen entrenched behind the walls of a genteel mansion in which there were a fine staircase of wrought metal and a number of rich carpets; the Madame Manilov who spent most of her time in yawning behind half-read books, and in hoping for a visit from some socially distinguished person in order that she might display her wit and carefully rehearsed thoughts—thoughts which had been de rigeur in town for a week past, yet which referred, not to what was going on in her household or on her estate—both of which properties were at odds and ends, owing to her ignorance of the art of managing them—but to the coming political revolution in France and the direction in which fashionable Catholicism was supposed to be moving? But away with such things! Why need we speak of them? Yet how comes it that suddenly into the midst of our careless, frivolous, unthinking moments there may enter another, and a very different, tendency?—that the smile may not have left a human face before its owner will have radically changed his or her nature (though not his or her environment) with the result that the face will suddenly become lit with a radiance never before seen there?...","Chichikov promised her that he would not carry the girl off, and Korobochka, reassured, started inspecting everything that was in her yard; she fixed her eyes on the housekeeper, who was carrying a wooden stoup full of honey from the larder, on a muzhik who appeared in the gateway, and gradually settled herself back wholly into her life of management. But why occupy ourselves for so long with Korobochka? Mrs. Korobochka, Mrs. Manilov, the life of management, or of non-management—pass them by! Otherwise—marvelous is the world’s makeup—the merry will turn melancholy in a trice, if you stand a long time before it, and then God knows what may enter your head. Perhaps you will even start thinking: come now, does Korobochka indeed stand so low on the endless ladder of human perfection? Is there indeed so great an abyss separating her from her sister, inaccessibly fenced off behind the walls of her aristocratic house with its fragrant cast-iron stairways, shining brass, mahogany and carpets, who yawns over an unfinished book while waiting for a witty society visit, which will give her a field on which to display her sparkling intelligence and pronounce thoughts learned by rote, thoughts which, following the law of fashion, occupy the town for a whole week, thoughts not of what is going on in her house or on her estates, confused and disorderly thanks to her ignorance of management, but of what political upheaval is brewing in France, of what direction fashionable Catholicism has taken. But pass by, pass by! why talk of that? But why, then, in the midst of unthinking, merry, carefree moments does another wondrous stream rush by of itself: the laughter has not yet had time to leave your face completely, yet you are already different among the same people and your face is already lit by a different light …","Chichikov assured her that he would not carry off the little wench, and Korobochka, set at rest, now began overseeing everything in her yard: she stared hard at the housekeeper, who was carrying a wooden flagon of honey out of a storeroom; at a muzhik who had bobbed up at the gates; and little by little she withdrew entirely into the life of her household. But why busy ourselves so long with Korobochka? Whether it be a Korobochka, or a Manilova, whether the mode of life be domestic or not, let us pass these things by. For isn’t everything in the world arranged with wondrous whimsicality? The gay can in an instant turn into the sad, if one stand and contemplate it overlong, and then God knows what odd notions may not stray into your head. Perhaps you may even take to thinking: “Come now, does Korobochka really stand so low on the infinite ladder that leads humanity to perfection? Is the chasm so great that divides her from her sister, who is so inaccessibly fenced in by the walls of an aristocratic house, with perfumes floating over its cast-iron staircases, a house gleaming with brass and mahogany, and glossy with oriental rugs; her sister who yawns over an unfinished book until such time as she starts out for a visit to some witty social gathering, which will furnish her with an arena where she may brilliantly show off her intelligence and express thoroughly rehearsed ideas, ideas which, according to the laws of fashion, will amuse the whole town for a week; ideas having nothing to do with what is going on in her house and on her country estates, both household and estates being in utter confusion and going to wrack and ruin, thanks to her ignorance of domestic science, but ideas having to do with whatever political upheaval is brewing in France, with whatever direction modish Catholicism may have taken?” But let these things pass, let them pass! Why talk of all this? But why, then, amid thoughtless, gay, carefree moments, does another, wondrous strain of thought flash of itself within us? The laughter has not yet had time to fade completely off your face, and yet you have already become a different person in the midst of the very same people, and your face has already become illumined with a different light...."

"— Я давненько не вижу гостей, — сказал он, — да, признаться сказать, в них мало вижу проку. Завели пренеприличный обычай ездить друг к другу, а в хозяйстве-то упущения… да и лошадей их корми сеном!

A most unseemly habit of visiting one another has come into fashion, and it means neglecting one’s work . . . and one has to give hay to their horses too!

"А между тем, в самом деле, по судам шли просьбы за просьбой. Оказались родственники, о которых и не слышал никто. Как птицы слетаются на мертвечину, так все налетело на несметное имущество, оставшееся после старухи. Доносы на Чичикова, на подложность последнего завещания, доносы на подложность и первого завещания, улики в покраже и в утаении сумм. Явились улики на Чичикова в покупке мертвых душ, в провозе контрабанды во время бытности его еще при таможне. Выкопали все, разузнали его прежнюю историю. Бог весть откуда все это пронюхали и знали. Только были улики даже и в таких делах, об которых думал Чичиков, кроме его и четырех стен никто не знал. Покамест все это было еще судейская тайна и до ушей его не дошло, хотя верная записка юрисконсульта, которую он вскоре получил, несколько дала ему понять, что каша заварится. Записка была краткого содержания: «Спешу вас уведомить, что по делу будет возня: но помните, что тревожиться никак не следует. Главное дело — спокойствие. Обделаем все». Записка эта успокоила совершенно его. «Этот человек, точно, гений», — сказал Чичиков.","And meanwhile, in fact, the courts were asking for a request. There were relatives that no one had heard of. As birds flock to carrion, so everything flew into the innumerable property left after the old woman. Denunciations of Chichikov, of the forgery of the last will, denunciations of the forgery of the first will, evidence of theft and concealment of sums. Evidence appeared on Chichikov in buying dead souls, in smuggling while he was still at customs. They dug up everything, found out its former history. God knows where all this sniffed out and knew. Only there was evidence even in such cases that Chichikov thought about, except for him and the four walls no one knew. For the time being, all this was still a judicial secret and did not reach his ears, although the correct note from the legal adviser, which he soon received, somewhat let him know that the porridge was brewed. The note was brief: “I hasten to inform you that there will be fuss in the case: but remember that you should not worry at all. The main thing is peace. We'll do everything."" This note calmed him completely. “This man is definitely a genius,” said Chichikov.","Meanwhile petition after petition poured into the law-courts. Relations turned up of whom nobody had heard before. Just as carrion birds flock about a dead body, so everybody pounced upon the immense property left by the old lady: there were secret reports upon Tchitchikov, upon the forgery of the last will, upon the forgery of the first will also, evidence of the theft and concealment of sums of money. Evidence was even produced incriminating Tchitchikov for the purchase of dead souls and for the smuggling of contraband goods at the time when he was in the Customs. They dug up everything and found out all his previous history. God knows how they scented it out and how they learned it. Evidence was even produced regarding matters of which Tchitchikov supposed that no one knew but himself and four walls. For a time all this was a judicial secret, and had not reached his ears, though a trustworthy note, which he very soon received from his lawyer, gave him some idea that a fine mess was brewing. The note was brief: “I hasten to inform you that there is going to be a great scrimmage; but remember that it never does to be agitated. The great thing is to be calm. We will manage everything.” This note completely reassured Tchitchikov. “That man’s a real genius,” he said when he had read the note.","Meanwhile, plea after plea had been presented to the legal authorities, and daily were relatives whom no one had before heard of putting in an appearance. Yes, like vultures to a corpse did these good folk come flocking to the immense property which Madam Khanasarov had left behind her. Everywhere were heard rumours against Chichikov, rumours with regard to the validity of the second will, rumours with regard to will number one, and rumours of larceny and concealment of funds. Also, there came to hand information with regard both to Chichikov’s purchase of dead souls and to his conniving at contraband goods during his service in the Customs Department. In short, every possible item of evidence was exhumed, and the whole of his previous history investigated. How the authorities had come to suspect and to ascertain all this God only knows, but the fact remains that there had fallen into the hands of those authorities information concerning matters of which Chichikov had believed only himself and the four walls to be aware. True, for a time these matters remained within the cognisance of none but the functionaries concerned, and failed to reach Chichikov’s ears; but at length a letter from a confidential friend gave him reason to think that the fat was about to fall into the fire. Said the letter briefly: “Dear sir, I beg to advise you that possibly legal trouble is pending, but that you have no cause for uneasiness, seeing that everything will be attended to by yours very truly.” Yet, in spite of its tenor, the epistle reassured its recipient. “What a genius the fellow is!” thought Chichikov to himself.","And meanwhile, indeed, petition after petition kept coming to the courts. Relatives turned up of whom no one had ever heard. As birds come flying to carrion, so everything came flying down upon the incalculable wealth left by the old woman. Denunciations of Chichikov, of the spuriousness of the last will, denunciations of the spuriousness of the first will also, evidence of theft and of the concealment of certain sums. Evidence turned up against Chichikov of his buying dead souls, of smuggling goods while he was still in customs. Everything was unearthed, the whole story of his past was found out. God knows how they got wind of it all and learned it. Yet there was evidence even of such things as Chichikov thought no one knew of except for himself and his four walls. So far it was all still a court secret and had not yet reached his ears, though a trustworthy note he had recently received from his lawyer gave him some idea that trouble was brewing. The content of the note was brief: “I hasten to inform you that there will be some fuss around the case; but remember that you ought by no means to worry. The main thing is to be calm. Everything will be taken care of.” This note set him completely at ease. “The man is indeed a genius,” said Chichikov.",

"Все было в порядке необыкновенном. Леса были загороженные; повсюду попадались скотные дворы, тоже не без причины обстроенные, завидно содержимые; хлебные клади росту великанского. Обильно и хлебно было повсюду. Видно было вдруг, что живет туз-хозяин. Поднявшись на небольшую возвышенность, увидели на супротивной стороне большую деревню, рассыпавшуюся на трех горных возвышениях. Все тут было богато: торные улицы, крепкие избы; стояла ли где телега — телега была крепкая и новешенькая; попадался ли конь — конь был откормленный и добрый; рогатый скот — как на отбор. Даже мужичья свинья глядела дворянином. Так и видно, что здесь именно живут те мужики, которые гребут, как поется в песне, серебро лопатой. Не было тут аглицких парков, беседок и мостов с затеями и разных проспектов перед домом. От изб до господского двора потянулись рабочьи дворы. На крыше большой фонарь, не для видов, но для рассматривания, где и в каком месте и как производились работы.","Everything was in order extraordinary. The forests were fenced off; cattle yards came across everywhere, also not without reason built up, enviably maintained; bread stacks to the growth of a giant. Abundant and bread was everywhere. It could be seen suddenly that the ace-owner was living. Having risen to a small hill, we saw on the opposite side a large village, scattered on three mountain hills. Everything here was rich: tortuous streets, strong huts; whether there was a cart somewhere - the cart was strong and brand new; if a horse came across - the horse was well-fed and kind; cattle - as a selection. Even the male pig looked like a nobleman. So it is clear that it is here that those men live who row, as the song says, silver with a shovel. There were no English parks here, pavilions and bridges with inventions, and various avenues in front of the house. Workers' yards stretched from the huts to the master's yard. There is a large lantern on the roof, not for views, but for viewing where and in what place and how the work was carried out.","Everything was in extraordinarily good order. The forest was fenced in; there were cattleyards, also with good reason enclosed and admirably kept up; the stacks of corn were gigantic. There was abundance and fertility on every side. It could be seen at once that here there was a prince among managers. Going a little up hill they saw a big village facing them, scattered upon three hillsides. Everything in it was prosperous; the roads were well made; the huts were solid; if a cart was standing anywhere, that cart was new and strong; if they met a horse the horse looked well fed and spirited. The horned cattle also looked picked specimens, even a peasant’s pig had the air of a nobleman. It was evident that here were living those peasants who dig silver with their spades as the song says. There were here no English parks, no arbours, no bridges, nothing fantastic, no landscape gardening. From the huts to the big house stretched a row of fishermen’s yards. On the roof was a watch tower, not for the sake of the view, but to see how and where the work was going on.","“It is sad indeed to see a man so superficial as to be unable to explain matters of this kind.” At length the manor appeared in sight—an establishment looking almost like a town, so numerous were the huts where they stood arranged in three tiers, crowned with three churches, and surrounded with huge ricks and barns. “Yes,” thought Chichikov to himself, “one can see what a jewel of a landowner lives here.” The huts in question were stoutly built and the intervening alleys well laid-out; while, wherever a waggon was visible, it looked serviceable and more or less new. Also, the local peasants bore an intelligent look on their faces, the cattle were of the best possible breed, and even the peasants’ pigs belonged to the porcine aristocracy. Clearly there dwelt here peasants who, to quote the song, were accustomed to “pick up silver by the shovelful.” Nor were Englishified gardens and parterres and other conceits in evidence, but, on the contrary, there ran an open view from the manor house to the farm buildings and the workmen’s cots, so that, after the old Russian fashion, the barin should be able to keep an eye upon all that was going on around him. For the same purpose, the mansion was topped with a tall lantern and a superstructure—a device designed, not for ornament, nor for a vantage-spot for the contemplation of the view, but for supervision of the labourers engaged in distant fields. Lastly, the brisk, active servants who received the visitors on the verandah were very different menials from the drunken Petrushka, even though they did not wear swallow-tailed coats, but only Cossack tchekmenu 47 of blue homespun cloth.","Everything was in extraordinarily good order. The woods were fenced off; there were cattle yards everywhere, also arranged not without reason and enviably well tended; the haystacks were of gigantic size. Everywhere was abundance and fatness. One could see at once that a top-notch owner lived here. Having climbed a small rise, they saw on the other side a large estate scattered over three hillsides. Everything here was rich: smooth streets, sturdy cottages; if a cart stood somewhere, the cart was a sturdy one and new as could be; if one came upon a horse, the horse was a fine and well-fed one; or upon horned cattle, then they were of the choicest quality. Even the muzhik’s pig had an air of nobility. Precisely here, one could see, lived those muzhiks who, as the song says, shovel silver with their spades. There were no English parks here, no gazebos, whimsical bridges, or various avenues in front of the house. Workshops stretched between the cottages and the master’s yard. On the roof there was a big lantern, not for the view, but for seeing where, and in what shop, and how the work was going on.",
"Но герой наш уже был средних лет и осмотрительно-охлажденного характера. Он тоже задумался и думал, но положительнее, не так безотчетны и даже отчасти очень основательны были его мысли. «Славная бабешка! — сказал он, открывши табакерку и понюхавши табаку. — Но ведь что, главное, в ней хорошо? Хорошо то, что она сейчас только, как видно, выпущена из какого-нибудь пансиона или института, что в ней, как говорится, нет еще ничего бабьего, то есть именно того, что у них есть самого неприятного. Она теперь как дитя, все в ней просто, она скажет, что ей вздумается, засмеется, где захочет засмеяться. Из нее все можно сделать, она может быть чудо, а может выйти и дрянь, и выйдет дрянь! Вот пусть-на только за нее примутся теперь маменьки и тетушки. В один год так ее наполнят всяким бабьем, что сам родной отец не узнает. Откуда возьмется и надутость, и чопорность, станет ворочаться по вытверженным наставлениям, станет ломать голову и придумывать, с кем, и как, и сколько нужно говорить, как на кого смотреть, всякую минуту будет бояться, чтобы не сказать больше, чем нужно, запутается наконец сама, и кончится тем, что станет наконец врать всю жизнь, и выйдет просто черт знает что!» Здесь он несколько времени помолчал и потом прибавил: «А любопытно бы знать, чьих она? что, как ее отец? богатый ли помещик почтенного нрава, или просто благомыслящий человек с капиталом, приобретенным на службе? Ведь если, положим, этой девушке да придать тысячонок двести приданого, из нее бы мог выйти очень, очень лакомый кусочек. Это бы могло составить, так сказать, счастье порядочного человека». Двести тысячонок так привлекательно стали рисоваться в голове его, что он внутренно начал досадовать на самого себя, зачем в продолжение хлопотни около экипажей не разведал от форейтора или кучера, кто такие были проезжающие. Скоро, однако ж, показавшаяся деревня Собакевича рассеяла его мысли и заставила их обратиться к своему постоянному предмету.","But our hero was already middle-aged and of a prudently chilled character. He, too, pondered and thought, but more positively, his thoughts were not so unaccountable and even partly very thorough. ""Glorious grandmother! he said, opening his snuff-box and sniffing the snuff. But what, most importantly, is good about her? The good thing is that she has only now, apparently, graduated from some boarding school or institute, that, as they say, there is still nothing womanish about her, that is, precisely that which they have the most unpleasant. She is now like a child, everything in her is simple, she will say what she pleases, she will laugh where she wants to laugh. Everything can be done from it, it can be a miracle, or it can turn out to be rubbish, and rubbish will come out! Let the mothers and aunts take care of her now. In one year, it will be filled with all sorts of women so much that the father himself will not recognize it. Where will both puffiness and stiffness come from, he will begin to toss and turn according to his instructions, he will puzzle and figure out with whom, and how, and how much to say, how to look at whom, he will be afraid at all times, so as not to say more than necessary, he will get confused finally on her own, and will end up lying all her life, and it will turn out just the devil knows what! Here he was silent for some time and then added: “But it would be interesting to know whose it is? what, like her father? Is it a wealthy landowner of respectable character, or just a well-meaning person with capital acquired in the service? After all, if, let's say, this girl was given two hundred thousand dowry, a very, very tasty morsel could come out of her. This could constitute, so to speak, the happiness of a decent person. Two hundred thousand dollars began to be drawn so attractively in his head that he began to inwardly become annoyed with himself, why, in the course of the fuss about the carriages, he did not find out from the postilion or the coachman who the passers-by were. Soon, however, the appearance of Sobakevich's village scattered his thoughts and forced them to turn to their constant subject.","But our hero was a man of mature years and of a cool and calculating temper. He too grew pensive and reflected but more practically, his reflections were not so irresponsible but were, one may say, very much to the point. “A fine wench,” he said, opening his snuff box and taking a pinch of snuff. “But what is it that is especially fine in her? What is best in her is that she is evidently fresh from some school or college, that there is so far nothing of what is called feminine about her, which is precisely what is most distasteful in them. Now she is like a child; everything about her is simple; she says what comes into her head, laughs when she is inclined to laugh. Anything could be made of her. She might become something wonderful and she might turn out worthless—and she will turn out worthless, too! Wait till the mammas and the aunties set to work on her. In one year they will fill her head with such feminine flummery that her own father will hardly know her. Conceit and affectation will make their appearance; she will begin to move and hold herself according to the instructions she has learned; she will puzzle her brains and consider with whom and how much to talk, how and at whom she must look; every minute she will be afraid of saying more than she ought; she will get caught in the snares herself at last and will end by lying all her life, and the devil knows what she will turn into! “ At this point he paused for a minute and then added: ” But it would be interesting to know who she is, and what her father is, whether he is a wealthy landowner of respectable character or simply a well-meaning man with a fortune made in the service. Why, supposing there is a nice little dowry of two hundred thousand with that girl, it would make her a very tempting little morsel. She might, so to speak, make the happiness of the right sort of man. “ The thought of two hundred thousand took such an attractive shape in his mind that he began to be inwardly annoyed with himself for not having ascertained from the postillion or the coachman who the ladies were. Soon however the sight of Sobakevitch’s house in the distance distracted his thoughts and made them turn to their invariable subject.","But in the present case the hero was a man of middle-age, and of cautious and frigid temperament. True, he pondered over the incident, but in more deliberate fashion than a younger man would have done. That is to say, his reflections were not so irresponsible and unsteady. “She was a comely damsel,” he said to himself as he opened his snuff-box and took a pinch. “But the important point is: Is she also a NICE DAMSEL? One thing she has in her favour—and that is that she appears only just to have left school, and not to have had time to become womanly in the worser sense. At present, therefore, she is like a child. Everything in her is simple, and she says just what she thinks, and laughs merely when she feels inclined. Such a damsel might be made into anything—or she might be turned into worthless rubbish. The latter, I surmise, for trudging after her she will have a fond mother and a bevy of aunts, and so forth—persons who, within a year, will have filled her with womanishness to the point where her own father wouldn’t know her. And to that there will be added pride and affectation, and she will begin to observe established rules, and to rack her brains as to how, and how much, she ought to talk, and to whom, and where, and so forth. Every moment will see her growing timorous and confused lest she be saying too much. Finally, she will develop into a confirmed prevaricator, and end by marrying the devil knows whom!” Chichikov paused awhile. Then he went on: “Yet I should like to know who she is, and who her father is, and whether he is a rich landowner of good standing, or merely a respectable man who has acquired a fortune in the service of the Government. Should he allow her, on marriage, a dowry of, say, two hundred thousand roubles, she will be a very nice catch indeed. She might even, so to speak, make a man of good breeding happy.” Indeed, so attractively did the idea of the two hundred thousand roubles begin to dance before his imagination that he felt a twinge of self-reproach because, during the hubbub, he had not inquired of the postillion or the coachman who the travellers might be. But soon the sight of Sobakevitch’s country house dissipated his thoughts, and forced him to return to his stock subject of reflection.","But our hero was already middle-aged and of a circumspectly cool character. He, too, waxed thoughtful and started thinking, but his reflections were more positive, not so unaccountable, and even in part quite substantial. “A nice wench!” he said, opening his snuffbox and taking a pinch. “But what is it, chiefly, that’s so good in her? What’s good in her is that, as one can see, she has just come out of some boarding school or institute, there’s nothing about her that is female, as they say, which is precisely what is most disagreeable in them. She’s like a child now, everything is simple in her, she says what she likes, she laughs when she wants to. Anything can be made of her, she may become a wonder, or she may turn out trash, and trash is what she’ll turn out. Just let the mamas and aunties start working on her now. In a year they’ll have her so filled with all sorts of female stuff that her own father won’t recognize her. Out of nowhere will come conceit and pomposity, she’ll start turning around on memorized instructions, she’ll start racking her brains thinking up with whom, and how, and for what length of time she should speak, how to look at whom, she’ll be afraid every moment of saying more than is necessary, she’ll finally get confused, and in the end she’ll finally start lying all her life, and the result will be devil knows what!” Here he fell silent for a short time, then added: “And it would be curious to know who her people are, what and who her father is, is he a rich landowner of respectable character or simply a well-meaning man with capital acquired in the service? For if, say, to this girl there were added some two-hundred-thousand-rouble dowry , she would make a very, very tasty little morsel. That might constitute happiness, so to speak, for a decent man.” The tidy little two hundred thousand began to picture itself so attractively in his head that he inwardly became vexed with himself for not having found out who the travelers were from the postillion or the coachman, while the bustle around the carriages was going on. Soon, however, the appearance of Sobakevich’s estate distracted his thoughts and made them turn to their perennial subject.","But our hero had already reached middle age and was of a circumspectly congealed character. He, too, was plunged into thought and kept thinking on and on, but in a more sedate manner; his thoughts were not so irresponsible and, to some extent, were even most substantial. “A glorious little wench!” said he to himself, opening his snuffbox and putting a pinch up his nostrils. “But then what, chiefly, is so good about her? It is good that she has only just now, evidently, finished some boarding school or scholastic institute; that as yet there isn’t anything womanish about her, as they say, i.e., precisely that which is most unpleasant about women. She is now like a child; everything about her is simple—she will say whatever may come to her mind, will laugh outright wherever and whenever she may feel like laughing. One can fashion anything out of her; she can be a miracle, and she may turn out to be so much trash—and will! Just let the mamas and aunties get hold of her now. In one year they’ll pump her so full of all sorts of womanishness that her own father won’t recognize her. Suddenly she’ll be all stuffiness and primness, she will take to being guided by precepts learned by heart, will take to racking her head and considering whom she may talk to, and how, and for how long she should talk, and how this one or that one should be regarded; at every moment she will be afraid of saying more than is necessary; she will become all mixed up herself, and it will all wind up by her lying all her life, and the upshot will be the Devil’s own mess!” Here he ceased his mental soliloquy for some time and then added: “But it would be interesting to know, of what family is she? Well, what’s her father like? A rich landed proprietor of well-esteemed character, or simply a prudent fellow whose capital was acquired in serving the state? For if, let us suppose, they were to give this girl a dowry of two hundred thousand or so, she might turn out to be a most dainty tidbit. This might constitute, so to say, happiness for some decent fellow.” The two hundred thousand or so came to be delineated in his head so vividly that he began, inwardly, to be vexed with himself because during the to-do about the two vehicles he had not found out from the outrider or the coachman who and what the chance travelers were. In a short while, however, the appearance of Sobakevich’s village distracted his thoughts and made them revert to their constant object."

"Конечно, поверить этому чиновники не поверили, а, впрочем, призадумались и, рассматривая это дело каждый про себя, нашли, что лицо Чичикова, если он поворотится и станет боком, очень сдает на портрет Наполеона. Полицеймейстер, который служил в кампанию двенадцатого года и лично видел Наполеона, не мог тоже не сознаться, что ростом он никак не будет выше Чичикова и что складом своей фигуры Наполеон тоже нельзя сказать чтобы слишком толст, однако ж и не так чтобы тонок. Может быть, некоторые читатели назовут все это невероятным; автор тоже в угоду им готов бы назвать все это невероятным; но, как на беду, все именно произошло так, как рассказывается, и тем еще изумительнее, что город был не в глуши, а, напротив, недалеко от обеих столиц. Впрочем, нужно помнить, что все это происходило вскоре после достославного изгнания французов. В это время все наши помещики, чиновники, купцы, сидельцы и всякий грамотный и даже неграмотный народ сделались по крайней мере на целые восемь лет заклятыми политиками. «Московские ведомости» и «Сын отечества» зачитывались немилосердно и доходили к последнему чтецу в кусочках, не годных ни на какое употребление. Вместо вопросов: «Почем, батюшка, продали меру овса? как воспользовались вчерашней порошей?» — говорили: «А что пишут в газетах, не выпустили ли опять Наполеона из острова?» Купцы этого сильно опасались, ибо совершенно верили предсказанию одного пророка, уже три года сидевшего в остроге; пророк пришел неизвестно откуда в лаптях и нагольном тулупе, страшно отзывавшемся тухлой рыбой, и возвестил, что Наполеон есть антихрист и держится на каменной цепи, за шестью стенами и семью морями, но после разорвет цепь и овладеет всем миром. Пророк за предсказание попал, как следует, в острог, но тем не менее дело свое сделал и смутил совершенно купцов. Долго еще, во время даже самых прибыточных сделок, купцы, отправляясь в трактир запивать их чаем, поговаривали об антихристе. Многие из чиновников и благородного дворянства тоже невольно подумывали об этом и, зараженные мистицизмом, который, как известно, был тогда в большой моде, видели в каждой букве, из которых было составлено слово «Наполеон», какое-то особенное значение; многие даже открыли в нем апокалипсические цифры.[29] Итак, ничего нет удивительного, что чиновники невольно задумались на этом пункте; скоро, однако же, спохватились, заметив, что воображение их уже чересчур рысисто и что все это не то. Думали, думали, толковали, толковали и наконец решили, что не худо бы еще расспросить хорошенько Ноздрева. Так как он первый вынес историю о мертвых душах и был, как говорится, в каких-то тесных отношениях с Чичиковым, стало быть, без сомнения, знает кое-что из обстоятельств его жизни, то попробовать еще, что скажет Ноздрев.","Of course, the officials did not believe this, but, however, they became thoughtful and, considering this matter, each to himself, found that Chichikov’s face, if he turns and becomes sideways, is very handy for a portrait of Napoleon. The police chief, who served in the campaign of the twelfth year and personally saw Napoleon, also could not help confessing that he would in no way be taller than Chichikov, and that Napoleon, too, could not be said to be too fat, but not so thin either. Perhaps some readers will call all this incredible; the author, too, to please them, would be ready to call all this incredible; but, unfortunately, everything happened exactly as it is told, and all the more amazing that the city was not in the wilderness, but, on the contrary, not far from both capitals. However, it must be remembered that all this took place shortly after the glorious expulsion of the French. At this time, all our landowners, officials, merchants, inmates, and every literate and even illiterate people became, for at least eight whole years, sworn politicians. Moskovskiye Vedomosti and Son of the Fatherland were read mercilessly and reached the last reader in bits that were not fit for any use. Instead of questions: “How much, father, did you sell a measure of oats? How did you use yesterday's powder? - they said: “And what do they write in the newspapers, have they let Napoleon out of the island again?” The merchants were greatly afraid of this, for they completely believed the prediction of one prophet, who had been sitting in prison for three years already; the prophet came from nowhere in bast shoes and an unsheathed sheepskin coat, terribly reeking of rotten fish, and announced that Napoleon was the Antichrist and kept on a stone chain, behind six walls and seven seas, but after that he would break the chain and take possession of the whole world. The prophet, for the prediction, got, as it should be, into prison, but nevertheless he did his job and completely embarrassed the merchants. For a long time, during even the most profitable transactions, the merchants, going to the tavern to drink tea, talked about the Antichrist. Many of the officials and the noble nobility also involuntarily thought about this and, infected with mysticism, which, as you know, was then in great fashion, saw in each letter from which the word ""Napoleon"" was composed, some special meaning; many even discovered apocalyptic figures in it.[29] So, there is nothing surprising that the officials involuntarily thought about this point; soon, however, they caught on, noticing that their imagination was already too trotting and that all this was not right. They thought, thought, explained and explained, and finally decided that it would not be a bad thing to ask Nozdryov a good deal more. Since he was the first to bring up the story of dead souls and was, as they say, in some kind of close relationship with Chichikov, therefore, without a doubt, he knows some of the circumstances of his life, then try what Nozdryov says.","Of course the officials did not fully believe this, but they grew very thoughtful, and each separately thinking the matter over, decided that Tchitchikov, if he were turned round and looked at sideways, was very much like the portraits of Napoleon. The police-master, who had served in the campaign of 1812 and had seen Napoleon in person, could not but admit that he was no taller than Tchitchikov, and that in figure Napoleon could not be said to be too stout, though on the other hand he was far from thin. Perhaps some of my readers will call this improbable; the author is quite prepared to oblige them by confessing that it is most improbable; but unfortunately it all happened precisely as described, and what makes it the more astonishing is that the town was not far away in the wilds, but, on the contrary, no great distance from both capitals. But it must be remembered that all this happened very shortly after the glorious expulsion of the French. At that period all our landowners, officials and merchants and shopmen and every one that could read and write, and even illiterate peasants, became at least for eight years inveterate politicians. The Moscow News and the Sun of the Fatherland were read with merciless zeal, and reached the last reader in tatters quite useless for any purpose whatever. Instead of such questions as: “At what price were they selling the measure of oats, sir?” “Did you get any fun out of the snow we had yesterday?” they used to ask: “What news is there in the paper? Haven’t they let Napoleon out of the Island again?” The merchants were in the greatest apprehension of this, for they put im- plicit faith in the predictions of a prophet who had been for three years in prison. No one knew where the prophet came from, he made his appearance wearing bark shoes, and an unlined sheepskin and smelling terribly of stale fish, and announced that Napoleon was Antichrist, and was bound by a stone chain behind six walls and seven seas, but later on would break his chain and gain possession of the whole world. The prophet was very properly put into prison for his predictions, but nevertheless he had done his work and completely confounded the merchants. Long afterwards, even at a time of most profitable transactions, the merchants talked of Antichrist when they went to the tavern to drink their tea. Many of the official class and of the gentry could not help thinking about it too, and infected by the mysticism which was, as is well known, all the fashion then, saw in every letter of the name Napoleon some peculiar significance, some even discovered Apocalyptic numbers in it. And so there is nothing surprising in the fact that the officials unconsciously thought on the same lines; but they soon pulled themselves together, realising that their imaginations were running away with them, and that all this was nonsense. They pondered and pondered and discussed and discussed and at last decided that it would not be amiss to question Nozdryov thoroughly again. Since he was the first to tell the story of the dead souls and was, so it was said, on very intimate terms with Tchitchikov, and therefore would undoubtedly know something about the circumstances of his life, it was decided to try again what Nozdryov could tell them.","Various other theories were then propounded, among them a theory that Chichikov was Napoleon, escaped from St. Helena and travelling about the world in disguise. And if it should be supposed that no such notion could possibly have been broached, let the reader remember that these events took place not many years after the French had been driven out of Russia, and that various prophets had since declared that Napoleon was Antichrist, and would one day escape from his island prison to exercise universal sway on earth. Nay, some good folk had even declared the letters of Napoleon’s name to constitute the Apocalyptic cipher! As a last resort, the tchinovniks decided to question Nozdrev, since not only had the latter been the first to mention the dead souls, but also he was supposed to stand on terms of intimacy with Chichikov.","Of course, as far as believing it went, the officials did not believe it, but nevertheless they did fall to thinking and, each considering the matter in himself, found that Chichikov’s face, if he turned and stood sideways, looked a lot like Napoleon’s portrait. The police chief, who had served in the campaign of the year ’twelve and had seen Napoleon in person, also could not help admitting that he was no whit taller than Chichikov, and that, concerning his build, it was impossible to say he was too fat, and yet neither was he so very thin. Perhaps some readers will call all this incredible; to please them, the author is also ready to call all this incredible; but, unfortunately, it all happened precisely as it is being told, and what makes it more amazing still is that the town was not in some backwoods, but, on the contrary, no great distance from the two capitals.50 However, it must be remembered that all this happened shortly after the glorious expulsion of the French. At that time all our landowners, officials, merchants, shop clerks, literate and even illiterate folk of every sort became sworn politicians for a good eight years at least. The Moscow Gazette and the Son of the Fatherland were mercilessly read to pieces and reached their last reader in shreds unfit for any use whatsoever. Instead of such questions as: “Well, my dear, how much did you get for a measure of oats?” or “Did you avail yourself of yesterday’s snowfall?” people would say: “And what are they writing in the papers, has Napoleon been let go from his island again?” The merchants were very much afraid of that, because they believed completely in the prediction of a certain prophet who had been put in jail three years before; the prophet had come from no one knew where, in bast shoes and a raw sheepskin coat that stank terribly of rotten fish, and announced that Napoleon was the Antichrist and was kept on a chain of stone beyond the six walls and the seven seas, but afterwards he would break the chain and take possession of the whole world. For this prediction the prophet had landed, quite properly, in jail, but he had done his bit all the same and completely disturbed the merchants. For a long time after, even during the most profitable dealings, as they went to the tavern to wash them down with tea, the merchants kept muttering about the Antichrist. Many of the officials and nobility also kept thinking about it inadvertently and, infected with mysticism, which, as we know, was in great vogue then, saw some special meaning in every letter that made up the word “Napoleon”; many even discovered Apocalyptic numbers in it.51 And so it is nothing surprising that our officials inadvertently kept pondering this point; soon, however, they checked themselves, noticing that their imaginations were galloping away with them, and that all this was not it. They thought and thought, talked and talked, and finally decided that it would not be a bad idea to question Nozdryov a little better. Since he was the first to bring out the story of the dead souls and was, as they say, in some close relationship with Chichikov, he therefore undoubtedly knew something about the circumstances of his life, so why not try again what Nozdryov would say.","Of course, when it came to actually believing this, the bureaucrats did not believe it, yet just the same, they fell into deep thought and, as each one scrutinized this business for himself, they found that Chichikov’s face, were he to turn and stand sideways, did bear a most striking resemblance to a portrait of Napoleon. The Chief of Police, who had served in the campaign of 1812 and had seen Napoleon with his own eyes, also could not but own that the Little Corporal couldn’t possibly be of a greater height than Chichikov and that in bodily build also Napoleon wasn’t what you would call any too stout, even though you couldn’t say he was any too thin, either. Perhaps there are some readers who will call all this improbable; the author, too, just for the sake of pleasing them, is ready to call all this improbable; but, as ill luck would have it, everything took place precisely as it is told here, and what is still more amazing, the town wasn’t in some backwoods but, on the contrary, not far from both our capitals. However, it must be remembered that all this took place only shortly after the glorious expulsion of the French. At that time all our landowners, officials, merchants, shopmen, and all our literate folk, as well as the illiterate, had become—at least for all of eight years—inveterate politicians. The Moscow News and the Son of the Fatherland were read through implacably and reached the last reader in shreds and tatters that were of no use whatsoever for any practical purposes. Instead of such questions as “What price did you get for a measure of oats, my friend?” or “Did you take advantage of the first snow we had yesterday?” people would ask, “And what do they say in the papers? Have they let Napoleon slip away from that island again, by any chance?” The merchants were very much afraid of this contingency, inasmuch as they had utter faith in the prediction of a certain prophet who had been sitting in jail for three years by now. This prophet had come no one knew whence, in bast sandals and an undressed sheepskin that reeked to high heaven of spoilt fish, and had proclaimed that Napoleon was Antichrist and was being kept on a chain of stone behind six walls and beyond seven seas but that later on he would rend his chain and gain possession of all the world. The prophet, as a reward for his prediction, landed in jail, which was just as it should have been; nevertheless, he had done his work and had thrown the merchants into utter confusion. For a long while thereafter, even during their most profitable deals, the merchants, on setting out for the tavern to wet the bargains with tea, would talk a bit about the Antichrist. Many of the officials, and the gentry and the nobility, also involuntarily thought of this from time to time and, infected by the mysticism which, as everybody knows, was all the go at the time, saw some sort of peculiar significance in every letter that went to form the name Napoleon; many even discovered Apocalyptic numbers in the name.1 And so there is nothing to wonder at if the bureaucrats involuntarily fell into deep thought on this point. In a short while, however, they came to, remarking that their imagination was far too frisky this time and that all this wasn’t the right thing. They pondered and they pondered; they deliberated and they deliberated, and the upshot was that they decided that it mightn’t be a bad idea to question Nozdrev rather thoroughly again. Since he had been the first to put out the story about the dead souls and was apparently on very close terms with Chichikov and was consequently bound to know, beyond a doubt, a thing or two about the circumstances of the latter’s life, they ought to have another go at it and see what Nozdrev had to say."
"Чичиков поклонился с признательностью. Узнавши, что он шел в палату за совершением купчей, Манилов изъявил готовность ему сопутствовать. Приятели взялись под руку и пошли вместе. При всяком небольшом возвышении, или горке, или ступеньке, Манилов поддерживал Чичикова и почти приподнимал его рукою, присовокупляя с приятной улыбкою, что он не допустит никак Павла Ивановича зашибить свои ножки. Чичиков совестился, не зная, как благодарить, ибо чувствовал, что несколько был тяжеленек. Во взаимных услугах они дошли наконец до площади, где находились присутственные места: большой трехэтажный каменный дом, весь белый, как мел, вероятно для изображения чистоты душ помещавшихся в нем должностей; прочие здания на площади не отвечали огромностию каменному дому. Это были: караульная будка, у которой стоял солдат с ружьем, две-три извозчичьи биржи и, наконец, длинные заборы с известными заборными надписями и рисунками, нацарапанными углем и мелом; более не находилось ничего на сей уединенной, или, как у нас выражаются, красивой площади. Из окон второго и третьего этажа высовывались неподкупные головы жрецов Фемиды и в ту ж минуту прятались опять: вероятно, в то время входил в комнату начальник. Приятели не взошли, а взбежали по лестнице, потому что Чичиков, стараясь избегнуть поддерживанья под руки со стороны Манилова, ускорял шаг, а Манилов тоже с своей стороны летел вперед, стараясь не позволить Чичикову устать, и потому оба запыхались весьма сильно, когда вступили в темный коридор. Ни в коридорах, ни в комнатах взор их не был поражен чистотою. Тогда еще не заботились о ней, и то, что было грязно, так и оставалось грязным, не принимая привлекательной наружности. Фемида просто, какова есть, в неглиже и халате принимала гостей. Следовало бы описать канцелярские комнаты, которыми проходили наши герои, но автор питает сильную робость ко всем присутственным местам. Если и случалось ему проходить их даже в блистательном и облагороженном виде, с лакированными полами и столами, он старался пробежать как можно скорее, смиренно опустив и потупив глаза в землю, а потому совершенно не знает, как там все благоденствует и процветает. Герои наши видели много бумаги, и черновой и белой, наклонившиеся головы, широкие затылки, фраки, сертуки губернского покроя и даже просто какую-то светло-серую куртку, отделившуюся весьма резко, которая, своротив голову набок и положив ее почти на самую бумагу, выписывала бойко и замашисто какой-нибудь протокол об оттяганье земли или описке имения, захваченного каким-нибудь мирным помещиком, покойно доживающим век свой под судом, нажившим себе и детей и внуков под его покровом, да слышались урывками короткие выражения, произносимые хриплым голосом: «Одолжите, Федосей Федосеевич, дельце за N368!» — «Вы всегда куда-нибудь затаскаете пробку с казенной чернильницы!» Иногда голос более величавый, без сомнения одного из начальников, раздавался повелительно: «На, перепиши! а не то снимут сапоги и просидишь ты у меня шесть суток не евши». Шум от перьев был большой и походил на то, как будто бы несколько телег с хворостом проезжали лес, заваленный на четверть аршина иссохшими листьями.","Chichikov bowed with gratitude. Upon learning that he was going to the chamber to complete the bill of sale, Manilov expressed his readiness to accompany him. Friends joined hands and walked together. At every slight rise, or hill, or step, Manilov supported Chichikov and almost lifted him with his hand, adding with a pleasant smile that he would not allow Pavel Ivanovich to bruise his legs in any way. Chichikov felt ashamed, not knowing how to thank him, for he felt that he was somewhat heavy. In mutual services, they finally reached the square where the offices were located: a large three-story stone house, all white as chalk, probably to depict the purity of the souls of the posts located in it; the other buildings on the square did not match the immensity of the stone house. These were: a guardhouse, near which a soldier stood with a gun, two or three cabs and, finally, long fences with famous fence inscriptions and drawings scratched with charcoal and chalk; there was nothing else in this secluded, or, as we say, beautiful square. From the windows of the second and third floors, the incorruptible heads of the priests of Themis protruded and at the same moment hid again: probably at that time the chief entered the room. The friends did not go up, but ran up the stairs, because Chichikov, trying to avoid being held by the arms by Manilov, quickened his pace, and Manilov, on his side, also flew forward, trying not to let Chichikov get tired, and therefore both were very out of breath when they entered into dark corridor. Neither in the corridors nor in the rooms was their gaze struck by cleanliness. They didn't care about her then, and what was dirty remained dirty, not taking on an attractive appearance. Themis just what it is, in a negligee and a dressing gown received guests. It would be necessary to describe the office rooms through which our heroes passed, but the author has a strong timidity towards all public places. If he happened to pass them even in a brilliant and ennobled form, with varnished floors and tables, he tried to run as quickly as possible, humbly lowering and lowering his eyes to the ground, and therefore he does not know at all how everything prospers and prospers there. Our heroes saw a lot of paper, both rough and white, bent heads, wide necks, tailcoats, coats of provincial cut, and even just some kind of light gray jacket, which came off very abruptly, which, turning its head to one side and laying it almost on the very paper, briskly and boldly wrote out some kind of protocol on the withdrawal of land or a typo of an estate seized by some peaceful landowner, peacefully living out his life under the court, having made himself and children and grandchildren under his protection, but short expressions were heard in fits and starts, uttered in a hoarse voice: Borrow, Fedosey Fedoseevich, business for N368! “You always drag a cork from a state-owned inkwell somewhere!” Sometimes a more majestic voice, no doubt one of the bosses, was heard imperatively: “Here, rewrite! otherwise they will take off their boots and you will sit with me for six days without eating. The noise from the feathers was great and looked like several wagons with brushwood were passing through a forest littered with a quarter of an arshin of withered leaves.","Tchitchikov bowed his acknowledgment. Learning that he was going to the government offices to complete the purchase, Manilov expressed his readiness to accompany him. The friends took each the other’s arm and walked on together. At the slightest rise in the ground, whether it was a hillock or a step, Manilov supported Tchitchikov and almost lifted him up, saying with an agreeable smile, as he did so, that he could not let Pavel Ivanovitch hurt his precious foot. Tchitchikov was abashed, not knowing how to thank him and conscious that he was no light weight. Paying each other these attentions they reached at last the square in which the government offices were to be found in a big three-storied brick house, painted white as chalk all over, probably as a symbol of the purity of heart of the various departments located in it. The other buildings in the square were out of keeping with the huge brick house. They were a sentry-box at which a soldier was standing with a gun, a cabstand, and lastly a long fence adorned with the inscriptions and sketches in charcoal and chalk usual on fences. There was nothing else in this desolate or, as the expression is among us, picturesque place. From the windows of the second and third storeys, the incorruptible heads of the votaries of Themisbz were thrust out and instantly disappeared again: probably their chief entered the room at the moment. The friends rather ran than walked up the stairs, for Tchitchikov, trying to avoid being supported by Manilov, quickened his pace, while Manilov dashed forward, trying to assist Tchitchikov, that he might not be tired, so both the friends were breathless when they reached the dark corridor at the top. The eye was not impressed with the high degree of cleanliness either of the corridor or of the rooms. At that time, they did not trouble about it and what was dirty remained dirty, and no attempt was made at external charm. Themis received her visitors, just as she was, in negligee and dressing-gown. The offices through which our heroes passed ought to be described, but our author cherishes the deepest awe for all such places. If he has chanced to pass through them even when they were in their most brilliant and dignified aspect with polished floors and tables, he has tried to hasten through them as quickly as he could, with bowed head and eyes meekly cast down, and so he has not the slightest idea how flourishing and prosperous it all looked. Our hero saw a vast amount of paper, rough drafts and fair copies, bent heads, thick necks, dress coats, frock coats of provincial cut, even a light grey jacket which stood out conspicuously among the others, and the wearer of which, with his head on one side and almost touching the paper, was writing in a bold and flourishing hand a report on a successful lawsuit concerning misappropriation of land or the inventory of an estate, of which a peaceable country gentleman had taken possession, and on which he had spent his life, maintained himself, his children and his grandchildren while the lawsuit went on over his head: and brief phrases uttered in a husky voice were audible by snatches: “Oblige me with case No. 368, Fe dosey Fedoseyitch!” “You always carry off the cork of the office inkpot!” From time to time a more majestic voice, doubtless that of one of the chiefs, rang out peremptorily: “Copy it out again, or they shall take your boots away, and you shall stay here for six days and nights with nothing to eat.” There was a great scratching of pens, which sounded like a cartful of brushwood driving through a copse a quarter of a yard deep in dead leaves.","Chichikov bowed his acknowledgements. Next, on learning that he was on his way to the municipal offices for the purpose of completing the transfer, Manilov expressed his readiness to accompany him; wherefore the pair linked arm in arm and proceeded together. Whenever they encountered a slight rise in the ground—even the smallest unevenness or difference of level—Manilov supported Chichikov with such energy as almost to lift him off his feet, while accompanying the service with a smiling implication that not if HE could help it should Paul Ivanovitch slip or fall. Nevertheless this conduct appeared to embarrass Chichikov, either because he could not find any fitting words of gratitude or because he considered the proceeding tiresome; and it was with a sense of relief that he debouched upon the square where the municipal offices—a large, three-storied building of a chalky whiteness which probably symbolised the purity of the souls engaged within—were situated. No other building in the square could vie with them in size, seeing that the remaining edifices consisted only of a sentry-box, a shelter for two or three cabmen, and a long hoarding—the latter adorned with the usual bills, posters, and scrawls in chalk and charcoal. At intervals, from the windows of the second and third stories of the municipal offices, the incorruptible heads of certain of the attendant priests of Themis would peer quickly forth, and as quickly disappear again—probably for the reason that a superior official had just entered the room. Meanwhile the two friends ascended the staircase—nay, almost flew up it, since, longing to get rid of Manilov’s ever-supporting arm, Chichikov hastened his steps, and Manilov kept darting forward to anticipate any possible failure on the part of his companion’s legs. Consequently the pair were breathless when they reached the first corridor. In passing it may be remarked that neither corridors nor rooms evinced any of that cleanliness and purity which marked the exterior of the building, for such attributes were not troubled about within, and anything that was dirty remained so, and donned no meritricious, purely external, disguise. It was as though Themis received her visitors in neglige and a dressing-gown. The author would also give a description of the various offices through which our hero passed, were it not that he (the author) stands in awe of such legal haunts. Approaching the first desk which he happened to encounter, Chichikov inquired of the two young officials who were seated at it whether they would kindly tell him where business relating to serf-indenture was transacted.","Chichikov bowed in gratitude. On learning that he was going to court to execute the deed, Manilov expressed a readiness to accompany him. The friends linked arms and set off together. At every little rise, bump, or step, Manilov supported Chichikov and almost lifted him up by the arm, adding with a pleasant smile that he would by no means allow Pavel Ivanovich to hurt his little feet. Chichikov was abashed, not knowing how to thank him, for he was aware that he was a bit on the heavy side. With mutual services they finally reached the square where the offices were located: a big three-story stone house, all white as chalk, probably to represent the purity of soul of the functions located within; the other structures on the square did not answer to the hugeness of the stone building. These were: a sentry box, where a soldier with a gun stood, two or three cabstands, and, finally, long fences with well-known fence inscriptions and drawings scrawled on them in charcoal or chalk; there was nothing else to be found on this solitary, or, as we say, beautiful square. From the windows of the second and third stories the incorruptible heads of the priests of Themis peeked out and ducked back at the same moment: probably a superior had come into the room just then. The friends did not so much walk as run up the stairs, because Chichikov, trying to elude the supporting arm from Manilov’s side, kept quickening his pace, while Manilov, on his side, rushed ahead, trying to keep Chichikov from tiring himself, with the result that they were both quite breathless as they entered the dark corridor. Neither in the corridors nor in the rooms were their eyes struck by cleanliness. Back then people did not bother about it, and what was dirty simply stayed dirty, not assuming an attractive appearance. Themis received her guests as she was, in négligée and dressing gown. The chancellery rooms through which our heroes passed ought to be described, but the author feels a great timidity before all official places. Even happening to pass through them when they were splendid and ennobled of aspect, with polished floors and tables, he has tried to run as quickly as possible, humbly lowering his eyes and casting them on the ground, with the result that he is totally ignorant of how everything there prospers and flourishes. Our heroes saw lots of paper, rough drafts and fair copies, bent heads, broad napes, tailcoats, frock coats of a provincial cut, and even simply some light gray jacket, which stood out quite sharply, its head twisted to one side and almost lying on the paper as it traced, deftly and boldly, some protocol on an appropriation of land or the perquisition of an estate taken over by some peaceful landowner, who was quietly living out his life under lawsuit and had acquired children and grandchildren for himself under its protection, and they heard scraps of short phrases, uttered in a hoarse voice: “Hey, Fedosei Fedoseevich, lend me that little case no. 368!” “You always walk off somewhere with the cork to the office ink bottle!” Sometimes a more majestic voice, undoubtedly that of one of the superiors, resounded commandingly: “Here, copy this! or we’ll take your boots away and you’ll sit here for six days without food.” The noise of pens was great and resembled that of several carts loaded with brushwood moving through a forest two feet deep in dry leaves.","Chichikov bowed in acknowledgment. Learning that he was going to the Administrative Offices to execute the title deeds, Manilov expressed a willingness to accompany him there. The friends linked arms and started off together. At every slight rise in the ground, or a hummock, or a step, Manilov would support Chichikov and almost give him a hand up, adding with a pleasant smile that under no circumstances would he permit Pavel Ivanovich to stub his small feet. Chichikov felt compunction, not knowing how to thank him, inasmuch as he sensed that he was somewhat heavy on the hoof. Rendering each other such mutual services they managed, at last, to reach on foot the square where the Administrative Offices were located, a great, three-story building of stone, all as white as chalk, probably to convey an idea of the purity of soul of the functionaries who had their offices within. The other structures on the square were hardly in keeping with the grandeur of the stone building. These other structures were: a sentry box, near which a soldier with a gun was standing; two or three cabstands, and, to conclude the list, long board fences with the familiar fenciana and wall art, sketchily executed in charcoal and chalk. There was nothing else to be found upon this barren (or, as it would be described by our writing brethren, beautiful) square. Several heads of the incorruptible priests of Themis popped out of the windows on the second and third stories and hid themselves the same minute: probably a superior was entering the room at that moment.1 The friends did not walk up but rather dashed up the stairs, since Chichikov, trying to avoid being supported under the arm by Manilov, had quickened his step, whereupon Manilov, for his part, flew forward, striving not to allow Chichikov to become fatigued, and for that reason both were puffing quite hard as they stepped into the dark corridor. Neither in the corridors nor in the chambers were their eyes overwhelmed with cleanliness. At that time cleanliness was still not considered a matter to be greatly concerned about, and that which was dirty just remained dirty, without acquiring any attractiveness thereby. Themis in all her simplicity, just as she is, was receiving her guests in negligee and dressing gown. The chancellery chambers through which our heroes passed really merit description, but the author cherishes a strong timidity where all administrative places are concerned. Even when he has had occasion to traverse such of these chambers as had a resplendent and ennobled air about them, with waxed floors and highly polished tables, he has tried to dash through them as quickly as possible, with his eyes meekly lowered and fixed on the ground, and for that reason he is utterly ignorant of how well and flourishingly everything is going on there. Our heroes saw a great deal of paper, both for rough drafts and of the purest white for final copies; they saw heads bent over their work, and broad napes of necks, and many frock coats, and dress coats of a provincial cut, or simply some sort of short jacket of light gray that stood out quite sharply, which jacket, with its head twisted almost entirely to one side and all but resting on the very paper, was nimbly and with a full sweep writing out some protocol or other concerning a land-grab, or the inventory of an estate appropriated by some peaceful landed proprietor or other who was tranquilly finishing out his days while the suit was going on, and who had lived long enough to beget not only children but grandchildren under the benign shelter of this suit. And one could hear, in snatches, brief remarks uttered in a hoarse tenor: “ Lend me, Fedosei Fedoseevich, the file on Number Three Hundred and Sixty-Eight!” “You’re always dragging off the lid of the office ink bottle somewhere!” At times a voice, more majestic and beyond a doubt belonging to one of the higher officials, would ring out imperiously: “There, transcribe that! And if you don’t, I’ll have them take the boots off you and keep you here for six days without food or drink.” Great was the scratching of quills, and the sound thereof was as if several carts laden with brushwood were driving through a forest piled with dead leaves a yard deep."
"— Ах, Павел Иванович, Павел Иванович! — говорил старик Муразов, качая головою. — Как вас ослепило это имущество! Из-за него вы и бедной души своей не слышите!","“Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, Pavel Ivanovich! said old Murazov, shaking his head. “How blinded you are by this property!” Because of him, you can't even hear your poor soul!","“Ah, Pavel Ivanovitch, Pavel Ivanovitch!” said the old man, shaking his head. “That property has blinded you! For the sake of it you have not thought of your poor soul.”","“Paul Ivanovitch,” said Murazov, shaking his head, “how that property of yours still seals your eyes and ears, so that you cannot so much as listen to the promptings of your own soul!”","“Ah, Pavel Ivanovich, Pavel Ivanovich!” old Murazov kept saying, shaking his head. “How blinded you are by this property!

"— Афанасий Васильевич! вашу власть и я готов над собою признать, ваш слуга и что хотите: отдаюсь вам. Но не давайте работы свыше сил: я не Потапыч и говорю вам, что ни на что доброе не гожусь.","- Afanasy Vasilyevich! your power and I am ready to recognize over myself, your servant, and whatever you want: I surrender to you.

Listen to me. In the monastery there is a recluse who never looks upon a human face. Of all men whom I know he has the broadest mind, and he breaks not his silence save to give advice. To him I went and said that I had a friend (though I did not actually mention your name) who was in great trouble of soul.","“Afanasy Vassilyevich! I, too, am ready to acknowledge your power over me, I am your servant and whatever you want: I give myself to you.

"— Вы спрашиваете, для каких причин? причины вот какие: я хотел бы купить крестьян… — сказал Чичиков, заикнулся и не кончил речи.","“For what reason, you ask?” The reasons are as follows: I would like to buy the peasants ... - said Chichikov, stammered and did not finish his speech.","“You ask for what reason. The reason is this, I should like to buy the peasants . . .” said Tchitchikov, hesitating and not finishing his sentence.","“You ask me,” said Chichikov, “for what purpose I want the list. Well, my purpose in wanting it is this—that I desire to purchase a few peasants.” And he broke off in a gulp.","“You ask, for what reasons? These are the reasons: I would like to buy peasants …,” Chichikov said, faltered, and did not finish his speech.","“For what reasons, you ask? Here are the reasons: I would like to buy some peasants—” said Chichikov, then stammered and did not finish what he was saying."
"Комната была, точно, не без приятности: стены были выкрашены какой-то голубенькой краской вроде серенькой, четыре стула, одно кресло, стол, на котором лежала книжка с заложенною закладкою, о которой мы уже имели случай упомянуть, несколько исписанных бумаг, но больше всего было табаку. Он был в разных видах: в картузах и в табачнице, и, наконец, насыпан был просто кучею на столе. На своих окнах тоже помещены были горки выбитой из трубки золы, расставленные не без старания очень красивыми рядками. Заметно было, что это иногда доставляло хозяину препровождение времени.","The room was certainly not without pleasantness: the walls were painted with some kind of blue paint, like gray, four chairs, one armchair, a table on which lay a book with a bookmark, which we have already had the opportunity to mention, several scribbled papers, but more everything was tobacco. It was in different forms: in caps and in a tobacco box, and, finally, it was simply poured in a heap on the table. On their windows, too, were placed mounds of ash knocked out of a pipe, arranged, not without diligence, in very beautiful rows. It was noticeable that this sometimes provided the owner with a pastime.","The room certainly was not without charm: the walls were painted a greyish-blue colour; there were four chairs, one easy-chair, a table on which lay the book and in it the book-marker which we have already had occasion to mention; but what was most in evidence was tobacco. It was conspicuous in various receptacles: in packets, in a jar, and also scattered in a heap on the table. In both the windows also there were little heaps of ashes, carefully arranged in very elegant lines. It might be gathered that their arrangement at moments afforded the master of the house a pastime.","And, indeed, the room did not lack a certain attractiveness. The walls were painted a sort of blueish-grey colour, and the furniture consisted of four chairs, a settee, and a table—the latter of which bore a few sheets of writing-paper and the book of which I have before had occasion to speak. But the most prominent feature of the room was tobacco, which appeared in many different guises—in packets, in a tobacco jar, and in a loose heap strewn about the table. Likewise, both window sills were studded with little heaps of ash, arranged, not without artifice, in rows of more or less tidiness. Clearly smoking afforded the master of the house a frequent means of passing the time.","The room was, indeed, not without agreeableness: walls painted a pretty light blue like a sort of gray, four chairs, one armchair, a table, on which lay the book with the bookmark in it, of which we have already had occasion to make mention, several scribbled-on sheets of paper, but mainly there was tobacco. It was in various forms: in paper packets, in the tobacco jar, and, finally, simply poured out in a heap on the table. On both windowsills were also placed little piles of knocked-out pipe ash, arranged not without assiduousness in very handsome rows. It could be observed that this sometimes provided the host with a pastime.","And the room really wasn’t devoid of a pleasant atmosphere; the walls were done in some charming bluish tint, on the grayish side; there were four chairs, one easy chair, a table on which a book was lying, with a bookmark inserted therein, which book we’ve already had occasion to mention, and several papers covered with writing; but there was more of tobacco there than of anything else. It was there in all shapes and forms: in paper boxes, in a tobacco jar, and, finally, simply strewn in a heap on the table. Also, lying upon both windowsills were little mounds of ashes knocked out of pipes and so disposed, not without pains, as to achieve very handsome little rows. It was obvious that, on occasion, this must have constituted a pastime for the master of the house."

"— В самом слове нет ничего оскорбительного, — сказал Тентетников, — но в смысле слова, но в голосе, с которым сказано оно, заключается оскорбление.

Вот что это значит!","“There is nothing offensive in the word itself,” said Tentetnikov, “but in the sense of the word, but in the voice with which it is said, there is an insult.

That's what it means!","“There is nothing insulting in the word itself,” answered Tyentyetnikov, “but in the significance of the word, in the voice in which it was uttered, that is where the insult lies. Thou! that means ‘Remember that you are of no importance; I receive you only because there is no one better, but if some Princess Yuzyakin comes, you know your place and stand at the door!’ That’s what it means.”","“The offence lay, rather, in the insult conveyed in the General’s tone.” Tientietnikov was a kindly and peaceable man, yet his eyes flashed as he said this, and his voice vibrated with wounded feeling. “Yet, even then, need you have taken it so much amiss?”","“There’s nothing insulting in the word itself,” said Tentetnikov, “but the sense of the word, the voice in which it was uttered, that’s where the insult lies.

"И, уехав домой, ни минуты не медля, чтобы не замешивать никого и все концы в воду, сам нарядился жандармом, оказался в усах и бакенбардах — сам черт бы не узнал.

Жители города и без того, как уже мы видели в первой главе, душевно полюбили Чичикова, а теперь, после таких слухов, полюбили еще душевнее. Впрочем, если сказать правду, они все были народ добрый, живя между собою в ладу, обращались совершенно по-приятельски, и беседы их носили печать какого-то особенного простодушия и короткости: «Любезный друг Илья Ильич», «Послушай, брат, Антипатор Захарьевич!», «Ты заврался, мамочка, Иван Григорьевич». К почтмейстеру, которого звали Иван Андреевич, всегда прибавляли: «Шпрехен зи дейч, Иван Андрейч?» — словом, все было очень семейственно. Многие были не без образования: председатель палаты знал наизусть «Людмилу» Жуковского, которая еще была тогда непростывшею новостию, и мастерски читал многие места, особенно: «Бор заснул, долина спит», и слово «чу!» так, что в самом деле виделось, как будто долина спит; для большего сходства он даже в это время зажмуривал глаза. Почтмейстер вдался более в философию и читал весьма прилежно, даже по ночам, Юнговы «Ночи» и «Ключ к таинствам натуры» Эккартсгаузена, из которых делал весьма длинные выписки, но какого рода они были, это никому не было известно; впрочем, он был остряк, цветист в словах и любил, как сам выражался, уснастить речь. А уснащивал он речь множеством разных частиц, как-то: «судырь ты мой, эдакой какой-нибудь, знаете, понимаете, можете себе представить, относительно так сказать, некоторым образом», и прочими, которые сыпал он мешками; уснащивал он речь тоже довольно удачно подмаргиванием, прищуриванием одного глаза, что все придавало весьма едкое выражение многим его сатирическим намекам. Прочие тоже были более или менее люди просвещенные: кто читал Карамзина, кто «Московские ведомости», кто даже и совсем ничего не читал. Кто был то, что называют тюрюк, то есть человек, которого нужно было подымать пинком на что-нибудь; кто был просто байбак, лежавший, как говорится, весь век на боку, которого даже напрасно было подымать: не встанет ни в каком случае. Насчет благовидности уже известно, все они были люди надежные, чахоточного между ними никого не было. Все были такого рода, которым жены в нежных разговорах, происходящих в уединении, давали названия: кубышки, толстунчика, пузантика, чернушки, кики, жужу и проч. Но вообще они были народ добрый, полны гостеприимства, и человек, вкусивший с ними хлеба ли или просидевший вечер за вистом, уже становился чем-то близким, тем более Чичиков с своими обворожительными качествами и приемами, знавший в самом деле великую тайну нравиться. Они так полюбили его, что он не видел средств, как вырваться из города; только и слышал он: «Ну, недельку, еще одну недельку поживите с нами, Павел Иванович!» — словом, он был носим, как говорится, на руках. Но несравненно замечательнее было впечатление (совершенный предмет изумления!), которое произвел Чичиков на дам. Чтоб это сколько-нибудь изъяснить, следовало бы сказать многое о самих дамах, об их обществе, описать, как говорится, живыми красками их душевные качества; но для автора это очень трудно. С одной стороны, останавливает его неограниченное почтение к супругам сановников, а с другой стороны… с другой стороны — просто трудно. Дамы города N. были… нет, никаким образом не могу: чувствуется точно робость. В дамах города N. больше всего замечательно было то… Даже странно, совсем не подымается перо, точно будто свинец какой-нибудь сидит в нем. Так и быть: о характерах их, видно, нужно предоставить сказать тому, у которого поживее краски и побольше их на палитре, а нам придется разве слова два о наружности да о том, что поповерхностней. Дамы города N. были то, что называют презентабельны, и в этом отношении их можно было смело поставить в пример всем другим. Что до того, как вести себя, соблюсти тон, поддержать этикет, множество приличий самых тонких, а особенно наблюсти моду в самых последних мелочах, то в этом они опередили даже дам петербургских и московских. Одевались они с большим вкусом, разъезжали по городу в колясках, как предписывала последняя мода, сзади покачивался лакей, и ливрея в золотых позументах. Визитная карточка, будь она писана хоть на трефовой двойке или бубновом тузе, но вещь была очень священная. Из-за нее две дамы, большие приятельницы и даже родственницы, перессорились совершенно, именно за то, что одна из них как-то манкировала контрвизитом. И уж как ни старались потом мужья и родственники примирить их, но нет, оказалось, что все можно сделать на свете, одного только нельзя: примирить двух дам, поссорившихся за манкировку визита. Так обе дамы и остались во взаимном нерасположении, по выражению городского света. Насчет занятия первых мест происходило тоже множество весьма сильных сцен, внушавших мужьям иногда совершенно рыцарские, великодушные понятия о заступничестве. Дуэли, конечно, между ними не происходило, потому что все были гражданские чиновники, но зато один другому старался напакостить, где было можно, что, как известно, подчас бывает тяжелее всякой дуэли. В нравах дамы города N. были строги, исполнены благородного негодования противу всего порочного и всяких соблазнов, казнили без всякой пощады всякие слабости. Если же между ими и происходило какое-нибудь то, что называют другое-третье, то оно происходило втайне, так что не было подаваемо никакого вида, что происходило; сохранялось все достоинство, и самый муж так был приготовлен, что если и видел другое-третье или слышал о нем, то отвечал коротко и благоразумно пословицею: «Кому какое дело, что кума с кумом сидела». Еще нужно сказать, что дамы города N. отличались, подобно многим дамам петербургским, необыкновенною осторожностью и приличием в словах и выражениях. Никогда не говорили они: «я высморкалась», «я вспотела», «я плюнула», а говорили: «я облегчила себе нос», «я обошлась посредством платка». Ни в каком случае нельзя было сказать: «этот стакан или эта тарелка воняет». И даже нельзя было сказать ничего такого, что бы подало намек на это, а говорили вместо того: «этот стакан нехорошо ведет себя» или что-нибудь вроде этого. Чтоб еще более облагородить русский язык, половина почти слов была выброшена вовсе из разговора, и потому весьма часто было нужно прибегать к французскому языку, зато уж там, по-французски, другое дело: там позволялись такие слова, которые были гораздо пожестче упомянутых. Итак, вот что можно сказать о дамах города N., говоря поповерхностней. Но если заглянуть поглубже, то, конечно, откроется много иных вещей; но весьма опасно заглядывать поглубже в дамские сердца. Итак, ограничась поверхностью, будем продолжать. До сих пор все дамы как-то мало говорили о Чичикове, отдавая, впрочем, ему полную справедливость в приятности светского обращения; но с тех пор как пронеслись слухи об его миллионстве, отыскались и другие качества. Впрочем, дамы были вовсе не интересанки; виною всему слово «миллионщик», — не сам миллионщик, а именно одно слово; ибо в одном звуке этого слова, мимо всякого денежного мешка, заключается что-то такое, которое действует и на людей подлецов, и на людей ни се ни то, и на людей хороших, — словом, на всех действует. Миллионщик имеет ту выгоду, что может видеть подлость, совершенно бескорыстную, чистую подлость, не основанную ни на каких расчетах: многие очень хорошо знают, что ничего не получат от него и не имеют никакого права получить, но непременно хоть забегут ему вперед, хоть засмеются, хоть снимут шляпу, хоть напросятся насильно на тот обед, куда узнают, что приглашен миллионщик. Нельзя сказать, чтобы это нежное расположение к подлости было почувствовано дамами; однако же в многих гостиных стали говорить, что, конечно, Чичиков не первый красавец, но зато таков, как следует быть мужчине, что будь он немного толще или полнее, уж это было бы нехорошо. При этом было сказано как-то даже несколько обидно насчет тоненького мужчины: что он больше ничего, как что-то вроде зубочистки, а не человек. В дамских нарядах оказались многие разные прибавления. В гостином дворе сделалась толкотня, чуть не давка; образовалось даже гулянье, до такой степени наехало экипажей. Купцы изумились, увидя, как несколько кусков материй, привезенных ими с ярмарки и не сходивших с рук по причине цены, показавшейся высокою, пошли вдруг в ход и были раскуплены нарасхват. Во время обедни у одной из дам заметили внизу платья такое руло, которое растопырило его на полцеркви, так что частный пристав, находившийся тут же, дал приказание подвинуться народу подалее, то есть поближе к паперти, чтоб как-нибудь не измялся туалет ее высокоблагородия. Сам даже Чичиков не мог отчасти не заметить такого необыкновенного внимания. Один раз, возвратясь к себе домой, он нашел на столе у себя письмо; откуда и кто принес его, ничего нельзя было узнать; трактирный слуга отозвался, что принесли-де и не велели сказывать от кого. Письмо начиналось очень решительно, именно так: «Нет, я должна к тебе писать!» Потом говорено было о том, что есть тайное сочувствие между душами; эта истина скреплена была несколькими точками, занявшими почти полстроки; потом следовало несколько мыслей, весьма замечательных по своей справедливости, так что считаем почти необходимым их выписать: «Что жизнь наша? — Долина, где поселились горести. Что свет? — Толпа людей, которая не чувствует». Затем писавшая упоминала, что омочает слезами строки нежной матери, которая, протекло двадцать пять лет, как уже не существует на свете; приглашали Чичикова в пустыню, оставить навсегда город, где люди в душных оградах не пользуются воздухом; окончание письма отзывалось даже решительным отчаяньем и заключалось такими стихами:","All these talks and reasonings produced, however, the most favorable consequences that Chichikov could have expected. Namely, rumors spread that he was no more, no less than a millionaire. The inhabitants of the city, as we have already seen in the first chapter, sincerely fell in love with Chichikov, and now, after such rumors, they fell in love even more sincerely. However, to tell the truth, they were all kind people, living in harmony with each other, treated in a completely friendly way, and their conversations bore the stamp of some special simplicity and brevity: “Dear friend Ilya Ilyich”, “Listen, brother, Antipator Zakharyevich! ”,“ You lied, mommy, Ivan Grigorievich. To the postmaster, whose name was Ivan Andreyevich, they always added: “Sprechen zi deutsch, Ivan Andreich?” In a word, everything was very family. Many were not without education: the chairman of the chamber knew Zhukovsky’s “Lyudmila” by heart, which was still unseen news at that time, and masterfully read many passages, especially: “Bor fell asleep, the valley sleeps,” and the word “chu!” so that it really seemed as if the valley was sleeping; for greater resemblance, he even at this time screwed up his eyes. The postmaster went more into philosophy and read very diligently, even at night, Jung's ""Nights"" and Eckartshausen's ""Key to the Mysteries of Nature"", from which he made very long extracts, but no one knew what kind they were; however, he was a wit, flowery in words and liked, as he himself expressed, to equip speech. And he equipped speech with many different particles, such as: “my sir, you are some kind, you know, you understand, you can imagine, relatively, so to speak, in a certain way,” and others that he poured in bags; he also rigged his speech quite successfully with winking, squinting one eye, which all gave a very caustic expression to many of his satirical allusions. Others were also more or less enlightened people: some read Karamzin, some Moskovskie Vedomosti, some even read nothing at all. Someone was what is called a tyuryuk, that is, a person who had to be kicked up to something; who was just a bobak, who, as they say, lay on his side for the whole century, which it was even in vain to raise: he would not get up in any case. It is already known about plausibility, they were all reliable people, there was no consumptive among them. All were of the kind to which the wives, in tender conversations taking place in solitude, gave names: egg-pods, chubby, pot-bellied, nigella, kicks, buzz, and so on. But in general they were kind people, full of hospitality, and a person who ate bread with them or spent an evening playing whist was already becoming something close, especially Chichikov with his charming qualities and methods, who really knew the great secret of being liked. They loved him so much that he saw no means of getting out of the city; All he heard was: “Well, a week, stay with us for another week, Pavel Ivanovich!” - in a word, he was worn, as they say, on his hands. But incomparably more remarkable was the impression (a perfect object of astonishment!), which Chichikov made on the ladies. In order to explain this in any way, it would be necessary to say a lot about the ladies themselves, about their society, to describe, as they say, with vivid colors their spiritual qualities; but for the author it is very difficult. On the one hand, he is stopped by unlimited respect for the spouses of dignitaries, and on the other hand ... on the other hand, it is simply difficult. The ladies of the city of N. were ... no, I can’t in any way: one can feel timidity. The most remarkable thing about the ladies of the city of N. was that ... It’s even strange, the pen does not rise at all, as if some kind of lead was sitting in it. So be it: about their characters, apparently, it is necessary to leave it to the one who has livelier colors and more of them on the palette, but we will only have to say a couple of words about appearance and that which is more superficial. The ladies of the city of N. were what is called presentable, and in this respect they could safely be set as an example to all others. As for how to behave, keep the tone, maintain etiquette, a lot of the most subtle propriety, and especially observe the fashion in the latest trifles, in this they are ahead of even the ladies of St. Petersburg and Moscow. They dressed with great taste, drove around the city in carriages, as the latest fashion prescribed, a footman swayed behind, and a livery in gold braid. A business card, whether it was written on a deuce of clubs or an ace of diamonds, but the thing was very sacred. Because of her, two ladies, great friends and even relatives, completely quarreled, precisely because one of them somehow skimped on a return visit. And no matter how hard the husbands and relatives later tried to reconcile them, but no, it turned out that everything can be done in the world, only one thing is impossible: to reconcile two ladies who had quarreled over a visit. Thus the two ladies remained in mutual dislike, as the society of the city put it. As regards the occupation of the first places, there were also many very strong scenes, which sometimes inspired the husbands with completely chivalrous, generous ideas about intercession. Of course, there was no duel between them, because they were all civil officials, but on the other hand, one tried to harm the other where possible, which, as you know, is sometimes harder than any duel. In morals, the ladies of the city of N. were strict, full of noble indignation against everything vicious and all sorts of temptations, they executed all weaknesses without any mercy. If between them some kind of thing that is called the second or third happened, then it happened in secret, so that no appearance was given of what was happening; all dignity was preserved, and the husband himself was so prepared that if he saw another or a third or heard about him, he answered briefly and prudently with the proverb: “Who cares that the godfather was sitting with the godfather.” It must also be said that the ladies of the city of N. were distinguished, like many ladies of St. Petersburg, by unusual caution and decency in words and expressions. They never said: “I blew my nose”, “I sweated”, “I spat”, but they said: “I relieved my nose”, “I managed with a handkerchief”. In no case was it possible to say: ""this glass or this plate stinks."" And you couldn't even say anything that would give a hint of this, but instead they said: ""this glass is not behaving well"" or something like that. In order to ennoble the Russian language even more, almost half of the words were completely thrown out of the conversation, and therefore it was very often necessary to resort to the French language, but there, in French, it’s a different matter: there words were allowed that were much harder than those mentioned. So, this is what can be said about the ladies of the city of N., speaking more superficially. But if you look deeper, then, of course, many other things will be revealed; but it is very dangerous to look deeper into ladies' hearts. So, limited to the surface, we will continue. Until now, all the ladies somehow spoke little about Chichikov, giving him full justice, however, in the pleasantness of secular treatment; but since the rumors about his millionth have swept, other qualities have been found. However, the ladies were not interested at all; the word ""millionaire"" is to blame for everything - not the millionaire himself, but precisely one word; for in one sound of this word, beyond any bag of money, there is something that affects people scoundrels, and people for nothing, and good people - in a word, it affects everyone. The millionaire has the advantage that he can see meanness, completely disinterested, pure meanness, not based on any calculations: many people know very well that they will not get anything from him and have no right to receive, but they will certainly at least run ahead of him, even laugh , even if they take off their hat, even if they force themselves on that dinner, where they find out that a millionaire has been invited. It cannot be said that this tender inclination towards meanness was felt by the ladies; however, in many drawing rooms they began to say that, of course, Chichikov was not the first handsome man, but he was such as a man should be, that if he were a little fatter or fuller, it would not be good. At the same time, it was said somehow even somewhat insultingly about the thin man: that he was nothing more, like something like a toothpick, and not a person. Many different additions turned out to be in ladies' outfits. There was a hustle and bustle in the Gostiny Dvor, almost a crush; there was even a festivity, to such an extent that the carriages ran over. The merchants were amazed to see how several pieces of fabric, brought by them from the fair and not getting away with it because of the price, which seemed high, suddenly went into circulation and were sold like hot cakes. During mass, a ruffle was noticed at the bottom of one of the ladies' dress, which spread it across half the church, so that the private bailiff, who was right there, gave the order to move the people further away, that is, closer to the porch, so that somehow the toilet of her high nobility would not be wrinkled. Even Chichikov himself could not partly fail to notice such extraordinary attention. Once, returning to his home, he found a letter on his desk; whence and who brought it, nothing could be known; the tavern servant replied that they had brought it and were not told to tell from whom. The letter began very decisively, just like this: “No, I must write to you!” Then it was said that there is a secret sympathy between souls; this truth was sealed with a few dots that took up almost half a line; then followed several thoughts, quite remarkable in their justice, so that we consider it almost necessary to write them out: “What is our life? - The valley where sorrows settled. What is light? ""A crowd of people who don't feel."" Then the writer mentioned that she was wetting with tears the lines of a tender mother, who, twenty-five years later, no longer exists in the world; they invited Chichikov to the desert, to leave forever the city, where people in stuffy fences do not use the air; the end of the letter even resounded with resolute despair and concluded with the following verses:","All these arguments and discussions, however, led to a more agreeable result than Tchitchikov could possibly have expected, that is, to the rumour that he was neither more nor less than a millionaire. The people of the town had already, as we have seen in the first chapter, taken a great liking to Tchitchikov, and after this rumour spread among them, their liking for him was even greater. Though, to tell the truth, they were all good-natured people, got on well together, and behaved in a friendly way to each other, and indeed, there was a peculiar note of kindliness and good humour in their conversation: “My dear friend, Ilya Ilyitch!” ... I say, Antipator Zaharye vitch, old man!“ . . . ” You are drawing the long bow, Ivan Grigoryevitch, my precious. “ ... When addressing Ivan Andreyevitch, people always added: ”Sprechen Sie Deutsch,ci Ivan Andreye vitch.“ ... In short they were all like one family. Many of them had some degree of culture; the president of the court of justice knew by heart Zhukovsky’s “Ludmila,”cj which was then a great novelty, and recited many passages in masterly fashion, especially, “ The forest sleeps, the valley slumbers,” and the word “Tchoo!” so that they really seemed to see the valley slumbering; for greater effect he actually closed his eyes at the passage. The postmaster was more devoted to philosophy and read diligently even at night,Young’s Night Thoughtsck and The Key to the Mysteries of Nature,cl by Eckartshausen, from which he copied out very long extracts; but no one knew what they were about. He was however a wit, flowery in his language, and fond as he expressed it of flavouring his words. And he did flavour his words with a number of all sorts of little phrases such as: “My dear sir, you know, you understand, you can fancy, as regards, so to say, in a certain sense,” and so on, which he scattered freely about him; he flavoured his language also rather successfully by winking and screwing up one eye, which gave a very biting expression to many of his satirical allusions. The others were all more or less cultured people, one read Karamzin,cm another read the Moscow News, while there were others who actually read nothing at all. Some were the sort of men who need a kick to make them rise to anything; others were simply sluggards lying all their lives on one side, as the saying is, and it would have been a waste of time to lift them up, they wouldn’t have stood up under any circumstances. As far as health and appearance goes, they were all, as we have said already, sound people, there wasn’t one consumptive among them. They were all of the kind to whom wives in moments of tender tête-à-têtecn use such endearing ep ithets as “tubby,” “fatty,” “chubby,” “dumpling,” “zou-zou,” and so on. But, take them all in all, they were a good-natured set, full of hospitality, and a man who had eaten their salt or spent the evening playing whist with them was at once near and dear to them, and Tchitchikov, with his fascinating qualities and manners, and his real understanding of the great secret of pleasing was, of course, especially so. They had grown so fond of him that he did not know how to tear himself from the town; he heard nothing but: “Come, a week, just one short week more, you must stay with us, Pavel Ivanovitch!” In fact he was, as the saying is, carried along in triumph. But incomparably more remarkable (truly a marvel!) was the impression which Tchitchikov made upon the ladies. To make even a partial explanation of it, one would have to say a great deal of the ladies themselves, of their society and their surroundings, to describe in living colours, as it is called, their spiritual qualities; but that is very difficult for the author. On the one hand he is restrained by his unbounded respect for the spouses of the higher officials, and on the other hand ... on the other hand, it is simply too difficult. The ladies of the town of N. were ... no, I really can’t : I really feel shy. What was most remarkable in the ladies of the town of N. was ... It is positively strange my pen refuses to move, as though it were weighted with lead. So be it: it seems I must leave the painting of their characters to some one whose colours are more vivid, and who has a greater variety on his palette; while I confine myself to a few words about their exterior and their superficial characteristics. The ladies of the town of N. were what is called presentable, and in that respect one may boldly hold them up as an example to all others. As regards deportment, elevation of tone, observance of etiquette and of a multitude of the most refined rules of propriety, and, above all, as regards following the fashion to its minutest details, they actually surpassed the ladies of Petersburg and Moscow. They dressed with great taste, and drove about the town in carriages, with a footman perched up behind, in a livery with gold lace on it, as prescribed by the latest fashion. A visiting card, even if it were written on a two of clubs or an ace of diamonds, was a very sacred thing. Two ladies, great friends and even relations, were completely estranged on account of a card, just because one of them had somehow failed to return a call. And in spite of all the efforts of their husbands and relations to reconcile them afterwards, it appeared that one may do anything else in the world, but that one thing is impossible—to reconcile two ladies who have quarrelled over failure to leave a card. And so the two ladies were left, “mutually indisposed” as the society of the town expressed it. The question of precedence also gave rise to many violent scenes, inspiring sometimes in their husbands a chivalrous and noble-minded conception of the duty of championing them. Duels of course did not occur because the gentlemen were all in the civil service, but on the other hand they tried to play each other nasty tricks wherever possible, and that as every one knows, is sometimes worse than any duel. In moral principles the ladies of N. were severe, full of noble indignation at everything vicious, and every form of depravity, and they punished every weakness without mercy. If what is known as a “thing or two” did occur, it was kept dark so that there was no outward sign of its having occurred; every dignity was preserved and the husband himself was so well primed, that if he did see a “thing or two,” or heard of it, he responded mildly and reasonably with the popular saying: What does it matter to any one else, if the godfather sits with the godmother? Another thing I must mention about the ladies of N. is that, like many Petersburg ladies, they were distinguished by great niceness and propriety in their choice of words and expressions. They never said: “I blew my nose, I got into a sweat, I spat,” but used instead some such expression as: “I made use of my handkerchief.” It was out of the question to say under any circumstances “that glass or that plate stinks,” or even to say anything that would suggest it; they said instead “that glass is not quite agreeable,” or something of the sort. To refine and elevate the Russian language, fully half the words in it were rejected from their vocabulary, and so it was very often necessary to have recourse to French; but in French it was quite a different matter; in that language they permitted themselves expressions far coarser than those mentioned above. So much for what may be said of the ladies of N., speaking superficially. Though, of course, if one were to look more deeply, many other things would be discovered, but it is very dangerous to look too deeply into the feminine heart. And so, confining ourselves to the superficial, we will continue. Hitherto the ladies had said very little of Tchitchikov, although they gave him full credit for his agreeable demeanour in company, but from the time that there were rumours of his being a millionaire, other qualities were discerned in him. Though, indeed, the ladies were not at all mercenary-minded: the word millionaire was to blame—not the millionaire himself but just the word; for in the mere sound of that word, altogether apart from the moneybags, there is something which produces an effect upon people who are scoundrels, upon people who are neither one thing nor the other, and upon good people too, that is, it produces an effect upon all. The millionaire has the advantage of meeting with servility that is quite disinterested, pure servility resting on no secondary motives: many people know perfectly well that they will never get a farthing from him and have no right to expect it, but yet will not fail to run to anticipate his wishes, to laugh at his jokes, to take off their hats, to wring an invitation for themselves to a dinner where they know he will be. It cannot be said that this tender inclination to servility was felt by the ladies; in many drawing-rooms, however, it began to be said that Tchitchikov was, of course, not strikingly handsome, but he was quite what a man ought to be, that if he were stouter or fatter, it would be a pity. And incidentally the observation was made—somewhat slighting to thin men in general—that they were more like toothpicks than men. All sorts of additional touches appeared in the attire of the ladies. There was quite a crowd, almost a crush in the arcade; there were so many carriages driving up to it that they were a regular procession. The shopkeepers were astonished at seeing that some pieces of material, which they had brought from the fair and could not get rid of on account of the price, had suddenly become the rage, and were snapped up regardless of expense. At mass in church one lady had a stiff flounce at the bottom of her skirt, which stuck it out so far all round her, that the police inspector of the quarter, who happened to be present, ordered the people to move further back, that they might not crush her honour’s costume. Tchitchikov himself could not help noticing the extraordinary attention paid him. One day on returning home he found a letter lying on his table. He could not find out from whom it came or who had brought it: the waiter informed him that it had been brought with orders not to say from whom it came. The letter began with great determination, in these words in fact: “Yes, I must write to you!” then something was said about a mysterious affinity of souls; this truth was confirmed by a number of dots which filled up half a line. Then followed several reflections so remarkable for their justice, that we feel it almost essential to quote them: “What is our life? A vale in which grief has taken up its abode. What is the world? The crowd of the unfeeling.” Then the writer mentioned that she was bedewing the lines with tears for a tender mother, who twenty-five years before had left this earthly sphere; Tchitchikov was invited to flee to the desert, to abandon for ever the town where, shut in by spiritual barriers, people did not breathe the air of freedom; the latter part of the letter had a note of positive despair, and ended with the following verses:","Indeed such was the interest taken by certain citizens in the matter that they advised the purchaser to provide himself and his convoy with an escort, in order to ensure their safe arrival at the appointed destination; but though Chichikov thanked the donors of this advice for the same, and declared that he should be very glad, in case of need, to avail himself of it, he declared also that there was no real need for an escort, seeing that the peasants whom he had purchased were exceptionally peace-loving folk, and that, being themselves consenting parties to the transferment, they would undoubtedly prove in every way tractable. One particularly good result of this advertisement of his scheme was that he came to rank as neither more nor less than a millionaire. Consequently, much as the inhabitants had liked our hero in the first instance (as seen in Chapter I.), they now liked him more than ever. As a matter of fact, they were citizens of an exceptionally quiet, good-natured, easy-going disposition; and some of them were even well-educated. For instance, the President of the Local Council could recite the whole of Zhukovski’s LUDMILLA by heart, and give such an impressive rendering of the passage “The pine forest was asleep and the valley at rest” (as well as of the exclamation “Phew!”) that one felt, as he did so, that the pine forest and the valley really WERE as he described them. The effect was also further heightened by the manner in which, at such moments, he assumed the most portentous frown. For his part, the Postmaster went in more for philosophy, and diligently perused such works as Young’s Night Thoughts, and Eckharthausen’s A Key to the Mysteries of Nature; of which latter work he would make copious extracts, though no one had the slightest notion what they referred to. For the rest, he was a witty, florid little individual, and much addicted to a practice of what he called “embellishing” whatsoever he had to say—a feat which he performed with the aid of such by-the-way phrases as “my dear sir,” “ my good So-and-So ,” “you know,” “you understand,” “you may imagine,” “relatively speaking,” “for instance,” and “et cetera”; of which phrases he would add sackfuls to his speech. He could also “embellish” his words by the simple expedient of half-closing, half-winking one eye; which trick communicated to some of his satirical utterances quite a mordant effect. Nor were his colleagues a wit inferior to him in enlightenment. For instance, one of them made a regular practice of reading Karamzin, another of conning the Moscow Gazette, and a third of never looking at a book at all. Likewise, although they were the sort of men to whom, in their more intimate movements, their wives would very naturally address such nicknames as “Toby Jug,” “Marmot,” “Fatty,” “Pot Belly,” “Smutty,” “Kiki,” and “Buzz-Buzz,” they were men also of good heart, and very ready to extend their hospitality and their friendship when once a guest had eaten of their bread and salt, or spent an evening in their company. Particularly, therefore, did Chichikov earn these good folk’s approval with his taking methods and qualities—so much so that the expression of that approval bid fair to make it difficult for him to quit the town, seeing that, wherever he went, the one phrase dinned into his ears was “Stay another week with us, Paul Ivanovitch.” In short, he ceased to be a free agent. But incomparably more striking was the impression (a matter for unbounded surprise!) which he produced upon the ladies. Properly to explain this phenomenon I should need to say a great deal about the ladies themselves, and to describe in the most vivid of colours their social intercourse and spiritual qualities. Yet this would be a difficult thing for me to do, since, on the one hand, I should be hampered by my boundless respect for the womenfolk of all Civil Service officials, and, on the other hand—well, simply by the innate arduousness of the task. The ladies of N. were— But no, I cannot do it; my heart has already failed me. Come, come! The ladies of N. were distinguished for— But it is of no use; somehow my pen seems to refuse to move over the paper—it seems to be weighted as with a plummet of lead. Very well. That being so, I will merely say a word or two concerning the most prominent tints on the feminine palette of N.—merely a word or two concerning the outward appearance of its ladies, and a word or two concerning their more superficial characteristics. The ladies of N. were pre-eminently what is known as “presentable.” Indeed, in that respect they might have served as a model to the ladies of many another town. That is to say, in whatever pertained to “tone,” etiquette, the intricacies of decorum, and strict observance of the prevailing mode, they surpassed even the ladies of Moscow and St. Petersburg, seeing that they dressed with taste, drove about in carriages in the latest fashions, and never went out without the escort of a footman in gold-laced livery. Again, they looked upon a visiting card—even upon a make-shift affair consisting of an ace of diamonds or a two of clubs—as a sacred thing; so sacred that on one occasion two closely related ladies who had also been closely attached friends were known to fall out with one another over the mere fact of an omission to return a social call! Yes, in spite of the best efforts of husbands and kinsfolk to reconcile the antagonists, it became clear that, though all else in the world might conceivably be possible, never could the hatchet be buried between ladies who had quarrelled over a neglected visit. Likewise strenuous scenes used to take place over questions of precedence—scenes of a kind which had the effect of inspiring husbands to great and knightly ideas on the subject of protecting the fair. True, never did a duel actually take place, since all the husbands were officials belonging to the Civil Service; but at least a given combatant would strive to heap contumely upon his rival, and, as we all know, that is a resource which may prove even more effectual than a duel. As regards morality, the ladies of N. were nothing if not censorious, and would at once be fired with virtuous indignation when they heard of a case of vice or seduction. Nay, even to mere frailty they would award the lash without mercy. On the other hand, should any instance of what they called “third personism” occur among THEIR OWN circle, it was always kept dark—not a hint of what was going on being allowed to transpire, and even the wronged husband holding himself ready, should he meet with, or hear of, the “third person,” to quote, in a mild and rational manner, the proverb, “Whom concerns it that a friend should consort with friend?” In addition, I may say that, like most of the female world of St. Petersburg, the ladies of N. were pre-eminently careful and refined in their choice of words and phrases. Never did a lady say, “I blew my nose,” or “I perspired,” or “I spat.” No, it had to be, “I relieved my nose through the expedient of wiping it with my handkerchief,” and so forth. Again, to say, “This glass, or this plate, smells badly,” was forbidden. No, not even a hint to such an effect was to be dropped. Rather, the proper phrase, in such a case, was “This glass, or this plate, is not behaving very well,”—or some such formula. In fact, to refine the Russian tongue the more thoroughly, something like half the words in it were cut out: which circumstance necessitated very frequent recourse to the tongue of France, since the same words, if spoken in French, were another matter altogether, and one could use even blunter ones than the ones originally objected to. So much for the ladies of N., provided that one confines one’s observations to the surface; yet hardly need it be said that, should one penetrate deeper than that, a great deal more would come to light. At the same time, it is never a very safe proceeding to peer deeply into the hearts of ladies; wherefore, restricting ourselves to the foregoing superficialities, let us proceed further on our way. Hitherto the ladies had paid Chichikov no particular attention, though giving him full credit for his gentlemanly and urbane demeanour; but from the moment that there arose rumours of his being a millionaire other qualities of his began to be canvassed. Nevertheless, not ALL the ladies were governed by interested motives, since it is due to the term “millionaire” rather than to the character of the person who bears it, that the mere sound of the word exercises upon rascals, upon decent folk, and upon folk who are neither the one nor the other, an undeniable influence. A millionaire suffers from the disadvantage of everywhere having to behold meanness, including the sort of meanness which, though not actually based upon calculations of self-interest, yet runs after the wealthy man with smiles, and doffs his hat, and begs for invitations to houses where the millionaire is known to be going to dine. That a similar inclination to meanness seized upon the ladies of N. goes without saying; with the result that many a drawing-room heard it whispered that, if Chichikov was not exactly a beauty, at least he was sufficiently good-looking to serve for a husband, though he could have borne to have been a little more rotund and stout. To that there would be added scornful references to lean husbands, and hints that they resembled tooth-brushes rather than men—with many other feminine additions. Also, such crowds of feminine shoppers began to repair to the Bazaar as almost to constitute a crush, and something like a procession of carriages ensued, so long grew the rank of vehicles. For their part, the tradesmen had the joy of seeing highly priced dress materials which they had bought at fairs, and then been unable to dispose of, now suddenly become tradeable, and go off with a rush. For instance, on one occasion a lady appeared at Mass in a bustle which filled the church to an extent which led the verger on duty to bid the commoner folk withdraw to the porch, lest the lady’s toilet should be soiled in the crush. Even Chichikov could not help privately remarking the attention which he aroused. On one occasion, when he returned to the inn, he found on his table a note addressed to himself. Whence it had come, and who had delivered it, he failed to discover, for the waiter declared that the person who had brought it had omitted to leave the name of the writer. Beginning abruptly with the words “I MUST write to you,” the letter went on to say that between a certain pair of souls there existed a bond of sympathy; and this verity the epistle further confirmed with rows of full stops to the extent of nearly half a page. Next there followed a few reflections of a correctitude so remarkable that I have no choice but to quote them. “What, I would ask, is this life of ours?” inquired the writer. “‘Tis nought but a vale of woe. And what, I would ask, is the world? ‘ Tis nought but a mob of unthinking humanity.” Thereafter, incidentally remarking that she had just dropped a tear to the memory of her dear mother, who had departed this life twenty-five years ago, the (presumably) lady writer invited Chichikov to come forth into the wilds, and to leave for ever the city where, penned in noisome haunts, folk could not even draw their breath. In conclusion, the writer gave way to unconcealed despair, and wound up with the following verses:","All this gossip and discussion produced, however, as favorable a result as Chichikov could possibly have looked for. Namely, the rumor spread that he was no more nor less than a millionaire. The inhabitants of the town, as we have already seen in the first chapter, had taken a hearty liking to Chichikov even without that, but now, after such rumors, their liking became heartier still. Truth to tell, however, they were all kindly folk, got along well among themselves, treated each other with perfect friendliness, and their conversations bore the stamp of some especial simple-heartedness and familiarity: “ My gentle friend Ilya Ilych,” “Listen, brother Antipator Zakharievich!” “You’re lying like a rug, Ivan Grigorievich, dear heart.” To the postmaster, whose name was Ivan Andreevich, they always added: “Sprechen sie Deych, Ivan Andreych?”35—in short, everything was on a quite familial footing. Many were not without cultivation: the head magistrate knew by heart Zhukovsky’s Lyudmila,36 which was then a not-yet-faded novelty, and masterfully recited many passages, especially “The forest sleeps, the valley slumbers” and the word “hark!” so that one actually seemed to see the valley slumbering; for greater similitude he even shut his eyes at that moment. The postmaster delved more into philosophy and read quite diligently, even at night, in Young’s Night Thoughts and The Key to Nature’s Mysteries by Eckartshausen,37 from which he copied out quite lengthy excerpts, though of what sort no one ever knew; anyhow, he was a wit, had a florid style, and liked, as he put it, to rig out his speech. And rig it out he did, with a host of various particles, such as: “my good sir, some such one, you know, you understand, can you imagine, relatively so to speak, in a certain fashion,” and others, which he poured out by the bagful; he also rigged out his speech rather successfully with winking, or squinting one eye, all of which lent quite a caustic expression to his many satirical allusions. Others, too, were more or less enlightened people: one read Karamzin, another the Moscow Gazette,38 another even read nothing at all. One was what is known as a sad sack, the sort of person who has to be roused with a kick to do anything; another was simply a slug-a-bed, lying on his back age in and age out, as they say, whom it was even useless to rouse: he would not get up in any case. As for seemliness, we know already that they were all reliable people, there were no consumptives among them. They were all the kind to whom wives, in those tender conversations which take place in private, gave such appellations as: chubsy, tubsy, tumsy, blackie, kiki, zhuzhu, and so on. But generally they were kindly folk, full of hospitality, and the man who sat down to table with them or spent an evening at whist was already an intimate, all the more so Chichikov, with his enchanting qualities and ways, who did indeed know the great secret of being liked. They grew so fond of him that he saw no way of tearing himself free of the town; all he heard was: “Come, a little week, you can spend one more little week with us, Pavel Ivanovich!”—in short, he was, as they say, made much of. But incomparably more remarkable was the impression (altogether an object of amazement!) that Chichikov made on the ladies. To begin to explain it, one would have to say a lot about the ladies themselves, about their society, to describe in vivid colors, so to speak, their qualities of soul; but for the author that is very difficult. On the one hand, he is prevented by his boundless respect for the wives of the dignitaries, and on the other hand … on the other hand—it is simply difficult. The ladies of the town of N. were … no, it is in no way possible for me: I really feel timid. The most remarkable thing about the ladies of the town of N. was … It is even strange, I cannot lift the pen at all, as if there were some kind of lead inside it. So be it: evidently it must be left to one whose colors are more vivid and who has more of them on his palette to speak of their characters, and we will just say a word or two of their appearance and of what is more superficial. The ladies of the town of N. were what is called presentable, and in this respect they may boldly be held up as an example to all others. As for knowing how to behave themselves, keeping tone, observing etiquette, a host of proprieties of the subtlest sort, and above all following fashion down to the least detail, in this they surpassed even the ladies of Petersburg and Moscow. They dressed with great taste, went for drives around town in carriages, as the latest fashion dictated, with lackey and gold-braided livery swaying behind. The visiting card, even if written on a deuce of clubs or ace of diamonds, was a very sacred thing. On account of it two ladies, great friends and even relatives, quarreled altogether, precisely because one of them once neglected a return visit. And how hard their husbands and relatives tried to reconcile them afterwards, but no, it turned out that while anything in the world might be done, only one thing could not be done: to reconcile two ladies who had quarreled over a neglected visit. And so these ladies remained mutually ill-disposed, in the expression of town society. With regard to occupying the foremost positions, a lot of rather big scenes also took place, which sometimes inspired the husbands to perfectly chivalrous, magnanimous notions of intercession. Duels, of course, did not take place between them, because they were all civil servants, but instead they tried to do each other dirt wherever possible, which, as everyone knows, can sometimes be worse than any duel. In morals the ladies of the town of N. were strict, filled with noble indignation against all vice and any temptation, and they punished any weaknesses without any mercy. And if there did occur among them something of what is known as this-or-that, it occurred in secret, so that there was no sign of its having occurred; full dignity was preserved, and the husband himself was so prepared that even if he saw this-or-that or heard about it, he would respond briefly with a proverb: “It’s always fair weather when friends get together. ” It must also be said that the ladies of the town of N. were distinguished, like many Petersburg ladies, by an extraordinary prudence and propriety in their words and expressions. Never would they say: “I blew my nose,” “I sweated,” “I spat,” but rather: “I relieved my nose” or “I resorted to my handkerchief.” It was in no case possible to say: “This glass or this plate stinks.” And it was even impossible to say anything that hinted at it, but instead they would say: “This glass is being naughty,” or something of the sort. To ennoble the Russian language still more, almost half of its words were banished from conversation altogether, and therefore it was quite often necessary to have recourse to the French language, although there, in French, it was a different matter: there such words were allowed as were much coarser than those aforementioned. And so, that is what can be told about the ladies of the town of N., speaking superficially. But if one were to look more deeply, then, of course, many other things would be discovered; but it is quite dangerous to look more deeply into ladies’ hearts. And so, confining ourselves to the superficial, we shall continue. Up to now the ladies had all somehow talked little about Chichikov, doing him full justice, however, as to the agreeableness of his social comportment; but since the rumors spread about his millions, other qualities were found. However, the ladies were not self-seeking in the least; the word “millionaire” was to blame for it all—not the millionaire himself, but precisely the word alone; for the sound of this word alone, aside from any bag of money, contains something that affects people who are scoundrels, and people who are neither this nor that, and people who are good—in short, it affects everyone. The millionaire has this advantage, that he is able to observe meanness, a perfectly disinterested, pure meanness, not based on any calculations: many know very well that they will not get anything from him and have no right to get anything, but they want to be sure at least to run ahead for him, at least to laugh, at least to doff their hats, at least to wangle themselves an invitation to dinner where they know the millionaire has been invited. It cannot be said that this tender inclination to meanness was felt by the ladies; nevertheless, in many drawing rooms there was talk of Chichikov being, not outstandingly handsome, of course, but still such as a man ought to be, that if he were any fuller or fatter, it would be not so good. Along with that, something was said which was even rather insulting with regard to the slim man: that he was nothing more than a sort of toothpick, and not a man. A great variety of additions occurred in the ladies’ attire. There was crowding in the shopping district, almost a crush; a fête even formed itself from all the carriages driving through. The merchants were amazed to see several lengths of cloth they had brought back from the fair and could not get rid of because the price seemed too high, suddenly come into demand and get snatched up. During the Sunday liturgy one lady was observed to have such a rouleau at the hem of her dress that it spread half the width of the church, so that a police officer who was there gave orders for the folk to move farther back, that is, nearer to the porch, to keep her ladyship’s toilette from being somehow crumpled. Even Chichikov himself could not fail partly to notice such extraordinary attention. Once, on returning home, he found a letter on his table; of whence and by whom it had been brought, nothing could be learned; the tavern servant replied that it had been brought with an order not to say whom it was from. The letter began very resolutely, namely thus: “No, I must write to you!” Then came talk about there being a mysterious affinity between souls; this truth was clinched by some dots, taking up almost half a line; then there followed some thoughts, quite remarkable in their correctness, so that we regard it as almost necessary to write them down: “What is our life? A vale wherein grief dwells. What is this world? A crowd of people who do not feel.” At that the writer mentioned that she was wetting with tears these lines of a tender mother who, for twenty-five years now, had not existed in this world; Chichikov was invited to the desert, to leave forever the town where people, behind stifling walls, make no use of the air; the ending of the letter even rang with decided despair and concluded with these verses:","All this talk and discussion, however, brought about the most beneficent consequences, such as Chichikov could hardly have expected—to wit, rumors spread that he was no more and no less than a millionaire. The citizens of this town had, even without this, as we have already seen in the first chapter, come to love Chichikov with all their hearts, and now, after such rumors, they came to love him with their hearts and souls both. However, if the truth were told, they were all kindhearted folk; they lived in concord among themselves, treating one another like perfect friends, and their conversations bore the impress of a certain peculiar simple-heartedness and intimacy: “My dear friend Ilia Ilich!”; “I say, brother Antipator Zakharievich!”; “Youve gotten all tangled up in your lies, Ivan Grigorievich, my little darling!” In the case of the Postmaster, whose name was Ivan Andreevich, they always tacked on the tag: “Sprechen Sie Deutsch?”—thus: “Sprechen Sie Deutsch, Ivan Andreich?”3 In short, everything was on a very homey footing. Many of them were not without culture: the Chairman of the Administrative Offices knew the Liudmila of Zhukovskii by heart—which poem was at that time a novelty hot off the presses—and recited many passages in a masterly fashion, especially: “Sleeps the pine grove; the dale slumbers “and when he came to “Hush!” he would pronounce it in such a way that one really seemed to see the dale slumbering; for the sake of greater verisimilitude he would at this point even half-shut his eyes.4 The Postmaster went in more for philosophy and read quite diligently, even burning the midnight oil—such things as Young’s Night Thoughts and Eckartshausen’s The Key to the Mysteries of Nature, from both of which he copied quite lengthy excerpts, but no one knew of just what nature these excerpts were.5 He was a wit, however, colorful in his choice of words, and fond, as he himself put it, of “garnishing” his speech. And the way he garnished his speech was through a multiplicity of sundry tag-ends and oddments of phrases, such as “my dear sir,” “some sort of a fellow,” “you know,” “you understand,” “you can just imagine,” “relatively speaking, so to say,” “in a sort of a way,” and other such verbal small change, which he poured out by the bagful; he also garnished his speech, quite successfully, by blinking one eye or puckering it up, all of which added quite a caustic air to many of his satirical innuendoes. The others were also more or less enlightened folk; this one would read Karamzin, that one the Moscow News, while a third, perhaps, even read nothing whatsoever.6 One might be what is called a “paper bag”—that is, a man who has to be kicked in the behind to arouse him to anything; another simply a solitary sluggard, who, as they say, lies abed all his life long, whom it would be even no use to arouse, he’d simply roll over on the other side. In terms of comeliness we have already seen that they were all solid people; there wasn’t a single consumptive among them. All the men were of the sort upon whom their wives, during the tender talks that take place in privacy, bestow pet names, such as Dumpling, Chubby, Tummy, Blackie, Kiki, Zuzu, and the like. But, in general, they were a kindly folk and full of hospitality, and a man who had partaken of their bread and salt or had sat through an evening of whist with them already became something near and dear to them; all the more so a Chichikov, with his enchanting qualities and ways, who really knew the great secret of making oneself liked. They fell in love with him to such an extent that he could not see any means of tearing himself out of the town; he never heard anything but: “There, one short week more, stay with us for just one short week more, Pavel Ivanovich!” In short, they simply dandled him like a baby, to use the common expression. But incomparably more remarkable was the impression (truly a matter to marvel at!) which Chichikov made on the ladies. In order to explain this, to however slight an extent, it would be necessary to say a great deal about the ladies themselves, about their society, to describe in living pigments, as the phrase goes, their spiritual qualities; but all that is a very difficult thing for the author. On the one hand he is held back by his boundless respect for the spouses of dignitaries, while on the other hand ... on the other hand it is simply a difficult thing to do. The ladies in the town of N-were . .. no, I simply can’t do it , I really do feel a certain timidity. The most remarkable thing about the ladies of the town of N-was ... Why, it’s actually odd , my quill absolutely refuses to rise, just as if it were loaded with lead or something. So be it, then: the description of their characters will evidently have to be left to him whose pigments are more vivid—and who has a greater variety of them on his palette; as for us, we’ll simply have to say a word or two, perhaps, about their appearance and about that which is rather superficial. The ladies of the town of N-were what is called presentable, and in this respect they might be boldly held up as an example to all others. When it came to such things as deportment, keeping up the tone, observing etiquette, as well as a multitude of the most refined proprieties, and particularly following the mode down to its very least trifles—why, in such things they were far ahead of the ladies of even St. Petersburg and Moscow. They dressed with great taste and drove about town in their carriages, as the latest fashion decreed, with a footman always swaying behind, and the livery on him all gold galloons. The visiting card, even if one were forced to improvise one out of a deuce of clubs or an ace of diamonds, was nevertheless a very sacred thing. Because of just such a thing, two of the ladies, not only great friends but actually relatives, broke off their friendship for good and all; to be precise, one of them had failed to make a contre-visite. And no matter how hard their husbands and male kindred strove afterward to reconcile them, it was no go; it turned out that one can accomplish all things in this world, save one alone: the reconciliation of two ladies who have fallen out over a neglected return call. And so both ladies remained “mutually disinclined,” to use an expression current in the grand monde of the town. The matter of precedence at social functions also brought about a great many quite stirring scenes, which at times inspired the husbands with perfectly chivalric and magnanimous notions of knight-errantry. No duels, of course, took place among them, inasmuch as all of them were Civil Service officials, but to make up for that each would try to pull some dirty trick on the other wherever and whenever possible, which, as everybody knows, can on occasion inflict greater damage than any duel. When it came to morals, the ladies of the town of N-were strict, filled with noble indignation against vice of any sort and temptations of every sort, punishing frailties without any mercy. But if what is known as “a thing or two” did occur among them, it occurred in secret, so that there was no hint whatsoever given of what was going on; propriety was entirely preserved, and the husband himself had been so well trained that, even if he did happen to catch a glimpse of “this and that,” or heard about it, he would answer succinctly and sensibly with the proverb: “He that would live at Peace and Rest, must hear and see, and say the Best,” or “Evil to him who evil thinks. ” It must also be said that the ladies of the town of N-were distinguished, like many ladies in St. Petersburg, by an unusual fastidiousness and decorum in their choice of words and expressions. Never did they say: “I blew my nose; I sweated; I spat”; instead they said: “I relieved my nose; I had to use my handkerchief.” One could not, under any circumstances, say: “This glass (or this plate) stinks,” and one could not even say anything that would give a hint of this, but instead of that they would say: “This glass is misbehaving,” or something else of that sort. In order to ennoble the Russian language still more, almost half the words therein were utterly rejected in conversation, and for that reason they frequently had to resort to the French language; also, to make up for their nicety in Russian, things were altogether different when it came to French—words far coarser than any of the examples given above were perfectly propre therein. And there you have whatever can be said (speaking quite superficially, of course) about the ladies of the town of N-. But if one were to look below the surface then, naturally, many other things would be revealed; however, it’s quite dangerous to look below the surface of feminine hearts. And so, limiting ourselves to superficiality in this case, let’s be getting on. Up to now the ladies had somehow discussed Chichikov but little, giving him his full due, however, for having such agreeable social graces. But once rumors began to spread about his millionairehood, they began finding many other good points about him. However, the ladies were not at all avaricious schemers: the fault of the whole thing lay in the very word millionaire—not in the millionaire himself but precisely in the very word, because the very sound of the word contains, outside of any vision of moneybags, a something that has an effect not only on men who are scoundrels but on men who are fine by nature, to say nothing of men who are neither one thing nor another; in a word, it has an effect on everybody. The millionaire has one great advantage: he can witness meanness that is utterly disinterested, meanness pure and unadulterated, meanness not based upon any ulterior motives whatsoever; many know very well that they won t get a thing out of him and that they aren’t entitled to anything, yet they’ll never fail at least to catch his eye, or to laugh ingratiatingly, or to doff their hats, or to wangle an invitation to the dinner to which, as they have learned, the millionaire has been invited. It can’t be said that this tender predisposition to meanness had been experienced by the ladies; however, in many of the drawing rooms they began saying that while Chichikov was not, of course, the handsomest of men, he was, just the same, all that a man should be, that were he but a little fatter (or stouter, rather) it would be a pity. In connection with this something would be said, even quite offensively somehow, concerning the man who was decidedly thin, that he was something in the nature of a toothpick rather than a man. Many and sundry additional touches appeared on the attire of the ladies. There was a great stir at the shopping arcade, almost a crush. There was something very like a parade of carriages, so many of them had gathered there. The merchants were amazed to see several bolts of goods they had brought home from the fair, and which had been left on their hands because the price had seemed high, now suddenly become all the rage and almost snatched out of their hands. During mass one of the ladies was seen with such a rouleau or hoop at the bottom of her dress that made it spread out over half the church, so that a policeman who was near by had to issue orders for the commoner folk to move back— nearer to the porch, that is—lest Her Highness’ raiment be rumpled somehow. And as for Chichikov himself, he could not but notice, if only in part, such unusual attentiveness. On one occasion when he came home, he found a letter on his table. Whence it had come and who had brought it he could not find out; the tavern waiter remarked that someone had brought it but had not wanted to say whom it was from. The letter began in very positive terms, precisely as follows: “No, I really must write you!” After that it went on to say that there is such a thing as a secret affinity between souls; this verity was clinched with a number of full stops that took up almost half a line. Then followed a few thoughts, quite remarkable for their incontrovertibility, so that we deem it almost indispensable to make an abstract of them: “What is our life? A vale of sorrows. What is the world? An insensate human herd.” Next the fair writer mentioned that she was bedewing with tears certain lines written by her angelic mother—five-and-twenty years had gone since she had passed from this world; she called on Chichikov to come out into the wilderness, to leave forever the city, where people in stifling enclosures cannot breathe the free air; the end of the letter even echoed downright despair and concluded with the following lines:"
"Уже более недели приезжий господин жил в городе, разъезжая по вечеринкам и обедам и таким образом проводя, как говорится, очень приятно время. Наконец он решился перенести свои визиты за город и навестить помещиков Манилова и Собакевича, которым дал слово. Может быть, к сему побудила его другая, более существенная причина, дело более серьезное, близшее к сердцу… Но обо всем этом читатель узнает постепенно и в свое время, если только будет иметь терпение прочесть предлагаемую повесть, очень длинную, имеющую после раздвинуться шире и просторнее по мере приближения к концу, венчающему дело. Кучеру Селифану отдано было приказание рано поутру заложить лошадей в известную бричку; Петрушке приказано было оставаться дома, смотреть за комнатой и чемоданом. Для читателя будет не лишним познакомиться с сими двумя крепостными людьми нашего героя. Хотя, конечно, они лица не так заметные, и то, что называют второстепенные или даже третьестепенные, хотя главные ходы и пружины поэмы не на них утверждены и разве кое-где касаются и легко зацепляют их, — но автор любит чрезвычайно быть обстоятельным во всем и с этой стороны, несмотря на то что сам человек русский, хочет быть аккуратен, как немец. Это займет, впрочем, не много времени и места, потому что не много нужно прибавить к тому, что уже читатель знает, то есть что Петрушка ходил в несколько широком коричневом сюртуке с барского плеча и имел по обычаю людей своего звания, крупный нос и губы. Характера он был больше молчаливого, чем разговорчивого; имел даже благородное побуждение к просвещению, то есть чтению книг, содержанием которых не затруднялся: ему было совершенно все равно, похождение ли влюбленного героя, просто букварь или молитвенник, — он всё читал с равным вниманием; если бы ему подвернули химию, он и от нее бы не отказался. Ему нравилось не то, о чем читал он, но больше самое чтение, или, лучше сказать, процесс самого чтения, что вот-де из букв вечно выходит какое-нибудь слово, которое иной раз черт знает что и значит. Это чтение совершалось более в лежачем положении в передней, на кровати и на тюфяке, сделавшемся от такого обстоятельства убитым и тоненьким, как лепешка. Кроме страсти к чтению, он имел еще два обыкновения, составлявшие две другие его характеристические черты: спать не раздеваясь, так, как есть, в том же сюртуке, и носить всегда с собою какой-то свой особенный воздух, своего собственного запаха, отзывавшийся несколько жилым покоем, так что достаточно было ему только пристроить где-нибудь свою кровать, хоть даже в необитаемой дотоле комнате, да перетащить туда шинель и пожитки, и уже казалось, что в этой комнате лет десять жили люди. Чичиков, будучи человек весьма щекотливый и даже в некоторых случаях привередливый, потянувши к себе воздух на свежий нос поутру, только помарщивался да встряхивал головою, приговаривая: «Ты, брат, черт тебя знает, потеешь, что ли. Сходил бы ты хоть в баню». На что Петрушка ничего не отвечал и старался тут же заняться каким-нибудь делом; или подходил с плеткой к висевшему барскому фраку, или просто прибирал что-нибудь. Что думал он в то время, когда молчал, — может быть, он говорил про себя: «И ты, однако ж, хорош, не надоело тебе сорок раз повторять одно и то же», — бог ведает, трудно знать, что думает дворовый крепостной человек в то время, барин ему дает наставление. Итак, вот что на первый раз можно сказать о Петрушке. Кучер Селифан был совершенно другой человек… Но автор весьма совестится занимать так долго читателей людьми низкого класса, зная по опыту, как неохотно они знакомятся с низкими сословиями. Таков уже русский человек: страсть сильная зазнаться с тем, который бы хотя одним чином был его повыше, и шапочное знакомство с графом или князем для него лучше всяких тесных дружеских отношений. Автор даже опасается за своего героя, который только коллежский советник. Надворные советники, может быть, и познакомятся с ним, но те, которые подобрались уже к чинам генеральским, те, бог весть, может быть, даже бросят один из тех презрительных взглядов, которые бросаются гордо человеком на все, что ни пресмыкается у ног его, или, что еще хуже, может быть, пройдут убийственным для автора невниманием. Но как ни прискорбно то и другое, а все, однако ж, нужно возвратиться к герою. Итак, отдавши нужные приказания еще с вечера, проснувшись поутру очень рано, вымывшись, вытершись с ног до головы мокрою губкой, что делалось только по воскресным дням, — а в тот день случись воскресенье, — выбрившись таким образом, что щеки сделались настоящий атлас в рассуждении гладкости и лоска, надевши фрак брусничного цвета с искрой и потом шинель на больших медведях, он сошел с лестницы, поддерживаемый под руку то с одной, то с другой стороны трактирным слугою, и сел в бричку. С громом выехала бричка из-под ворот гостиницы на улицу. Проходивший поп снял шляпу, несколько мальчишек в замаранных рубашках протянули руки, приговаривая: «Барин, подай сиротиньке!» Кучер, заметивши, что один из них был большой охотник становиться на запятки, хлыснул его кнутом, и бричка пошла прыгать по камням. Не без радости был вдали узрет полосатый шлагбаум, дававший знать, что мостовой, как и всякой другой муке, будет скоро конец; и еще несколько раз ударившись довольно крепко головою в кузов, Чичиков понесся наконец по мягкой земле. Едва только ушел назад город, как уже пошли писать, по нашему обычаю, чушь и дичь по обеим сторонам дороги: кочки, ельник, низенькие жидкие кусты молодых сосен, обгорелые стволы старых, дикий вереск и тому подобный вздор. Попадались вытянутые по шнурку деревни, постройкою похожие на старые складенные дрова, покрытые серыми крышами с резными деревянными под ними украшениями в виде висячих шитых узорами утиральников. Несколько мужиков, по обыкновению, зевали, сидя на лавках перед воротами в своих овчинных тулупах. Бабы с толстыми лицами и перевязанными грудями смотрели из верхних окон; из нижних глядел теленок или высовывала слепую морду свою свинья. Словом, виды известные. Проехавши пятнадцатую версту, он вспомнил, что здесь, по словам Манилова, должна быть его деревня, но и шестнадцатая верста пролетела мимо, а деревни все не было видно, и если бы не два мужика. попавшиеся навстречу, то вряд ли бы довелось им потрафить на лад.","For more than a week the visiting gentleman had been living in the city, driving around for parties and dinners, and thus spending, as they say, a very pleasant time. Finally, he decided to postpone his visits outside the city and visit the landowners Manilov and Sobakevich, to whom he gave his word. Perhaps another, more significant reason prompted him to do this, a matter more serious, closer to his heart ... But the reader will learn about all this gradually and in due time, if he only has the patience to read the proposed story, which is very long, having after that to move apart wider and more spacious as you approach the end, crowning the case. The coachman Selifan was ordered early in the morning to put the horses into a well-known britzka; Petrushka was ordered to stay at home, to look after the room and the suitcase. It will not be superfluous for the reader to get acquainted with these two serfs of our hero. Although, of course, they are not so noticeable faces, and what are called secondary or even tertiary ones, although the main moves and springs of the poem are not approved on them and only in some places touch and easily hook them, but the author likes to be extremely thorough in everything and from this side, despite the fact that the person himself is Russian, he wants to be accurate, like a German. This, however, will not take much time and space, because not much needs to be added to what the reader already knows, that is, that Petrushka went about in a somewhat wide brown frock coat from the master's shoulder and, as was customary for people of his rank, had a large nose and lips. . He was more silent than talkative in character; he even had a noble impulse to enlightenment, that is, to read books, the content of which was not difficult for him: it made absolutely no difference to him whether the adventure of a hero in love, just a primer or a prayer book - he read everything with equal attention; if he had been given chemo, he would not have refused it either. He liked not what he read about, but rather the reading itself, or, to put it better, the process of reading itself, that some word always comes out of the letters, which sometimes the devil knows what it means. This reading was done more in a lying position in the hallway, on the bed and on the mattress, which became dead and thin as a cake from such a circumstance. In addition to his passion for reading, he had two more habits, which constituted two of his other characteristic features: to sleep without undressing, as he was, in the same frock coat, and always to carry with him some kind of special air, of his own smell, which resonated somewhat living peace, so that it was enough for him to just add his bed somewhere, even in a hitherto uninhabited room, and drag his overcoat and belongings there, and it already seemed that people had lived in this room for ten years. Chichikov, being a very ticklish and even in some cases fastidious person, drawing air into his fresh nose in the morning, only grimaced and shook his head, saying: “You, brother, the devil knows you, are you sweating or something. You should have gone to the bath."" To which Petrushka made no answer and tried to get down to business at once; or approached with a whip to the lord's hanging tailcoat, or simply tidied up something. What he was thinking at the time when he was silent - perhaps he was saying to himself: ""And you, however, are good, you are not tired of repeating the same thing forty times"" - God knows, it's hard to know what the courtyard thinks a serf at that time, the master gives him instructions. So, here is what for the first time can be said about Petrushka. The coachman Selifan was a completely different person ... But the author is very ashamed to keep his readers busy for so long with people of the low class, knowing from experience how reluctantly they get acquainted with the low classes. Such is already a Russian man: a strong passion to be arrogant with someone who would be at least one rank higher than him, and a captive acquaintance with a count or prince is better for him than any close friendly relations. The author even fears for his hero, who is only a collegiate adviser. Court advisers, perhaps, will get to know him, but those who have already crept up to the ranks of generals, those, God knows, may even cast one of those contemptuous glances that a man proudly throws at everything that does not grovel at his feet. , or, even worse, perhaps they will pass by a fatal inattention for the author. But no matter how regrettable one or the other, but all the same, it is necessary to return to the hero. So, having given the necessary orders in the evening, waking up very early in the morning, having washed, dried from head to toe with a wet sponge, which was done only on Sundays - and on that day it was Sunday - having shaved in such a way that the cheeks became a real satin in reasoning of smoothness and gloss, putting on a lingonberry-colored tailcoat with a sparkle and then an overcoat on big bears, he descended the stairs, supported by the arm, first on one side, then on the other, by a tavern servant, and sat down in the britzka. With a thunder, the britzka drove out from under the gate of the hotel into the street. The passing priest took off his hat, several boys in soiled shirts held out their hands, saying: “Master, give it to the orphan!” The coachman, noticing that one of them was a big fan of standing on the heel, whipped him with a whip, and the britzka went to jump over the stones. Not without joy, he saw a striped barrier in the distance, letting know that the pavement, like any other torment, would soon end; and hitting his head quite hard on the truck a few more times, Chichikov finally rushed across the soft earth. As soon as the city had gone back, they began to write, according to our custom, nonsense and game on both sides of the road: tussocks, fir groves, low thin bushes of young pines, burnt trunks of old ones, wild heather, and similar nonsense. There were villages stretched out along a string, built like old stacked firewood, covered with gray roofs with carved wooden decorations underneath in the form of hanging embroidered towels. Several peasants, as usual, yawned, sitting on benches in front of the gates in their sheepskin coats. Babas with fat faces and bandaged breasts looked out of the upper windows; a calf peered out of the lower ones, or a pig stuck out its blind snout. In a word, the species are known. Having traveled the fifteenth verst, he remembered that here, according to Manilov, should be his village, but even the sixteenth verst flew past, and the village was still not visible, and if not for two peasants. come across, then they would hardly have had a chance to please them in a good way.","Our new-comer had stayed for over a week in the town, driving about to evening-parties and dinners and so passing his time, as it is called, very agreeably. At last he made up his mind to carry his visits beyond the town and to go and see Manilov and Sobakevitch as he had promised. Perhaps he was impelled to this by another more essential reason, by something more serious and nearer to his heart.... But of all this the reader will learn by degrees in due season, if only he has the patience to read through the following narrative, a very long one, since it was later on to cover a wider and wider ground as it approaches its conclusion. Selifan the coachman was given orders to put the horses into the familiar chaise early in the morning; Petrushka was instructed to remain at home to look after the room and portmanteau. It will not be amiss for the reader to be made acquainted with these two serfs of our hero’s. Although of course they are not very prominent characters but are rather what are called secondary or even tertiary, though the principal events and the mainsprings of the poem do not rest upon them, and only here and there touch and lightly catch upon them, yet the author likes to be extremely circumstantial in everything and in that respect, though a Russian, prefers to be as precise as a German. This however will not take up much time and space, since we need not add much to what the reader knows already, that is, that Petrushka wore a rather roomy brown coat that had been his master‘s, and had, as usual with persons of his calling, a thick nose and lips. He was rather of a taciturn than of a talkative disposition; he even had a generous yearning for enlightenment, that is, for reading books, over the subject of which he did not trouble himself: it was precisely the same to him whether it was the story of a love-sick hero’s adventures, or simply a dictionary or a prayer-book-he read everything with equal attention. If he had been offered a manual of chemistry he would not have refused it. He liked not so much what he read as the reading itself, or rather the process of reading, the fact that the letters continually made up a word and the devil knows what it might sometimes mean. His reading was for the most part done in a recumbent position on the bedstead in the passage and on a mattress which had through this habit been flattened out as thin as a wafer. Apart from his passion for reading he had two other characteristics; he slept without undressing, just as he was, in the same coat, and he always brought with him his own peculiar atmosphere, his individual odour which was suggestive of a room which has been lived in a long time, so that it was enough for him to put up his bedstead somewhere even in a room hitherto uninhabited, and to instal there his greatcoat and belongings for it to seem at once as though people had been living in the room for the last ten years. Tchitchikov, who was a very fastidious and in some cases an over-particular man, would pucker up his face when he sniffed the air in the morning and, shaking his head, would say: “Goodness knows what it is, my boy, you are in a sweat or something, you should go to the bath.” To which Petrushka made no reply but tried to be very busy about something at once: either he went with a brush to his master’s dress coat hanging on a peg, or simply put something in its place. What was he thinking while he was silent? Perhaps he was saying to himself: “You are a nice one too, you are never tired of saying the same thing forty times over....” God knows, it is hard to tell what a serf is thinking when his master is giving him a lecture. So much then may be said of Petrushka to start with. Selifan, the coachman, was quite a different man.... But the author is really ashamed of occupying his readers’ attention so long with persons of a low class, knowing from experience how reluctant they are to make acquaintance with the lower orders. It is characteristic of the Russian that he has a great passion for making the acquaintance of any one who is ever so little higher in rank, and a nodding acquaintance with a count or a prince is more precious to him than the closest friendship of ordinary human beings. The author, indeed, is a little anxious over his hero who is only a collegiate councillor. Court councillors perhaps will consent to make his acquaintance, but those who have attained the rank of general may perhaps—God knows—cast upon him one of those contemptuous glances which a man proudly casts at everything which grovels at his feet, or, worse still perhaps, pass by with an indifference that will stab the author to the heart. But however mortifying either of these alternatives would be, we must in any case return now to our hero. And so, having given his orders overnight, he woke up very early in the morning, washed, rubbing himself from head to foot with a wet sponge, an operation only performed on Sundays—and it happened to be a Sunday—he shaved so thoroughly that his cheeks were like satin for smoothness and glossiness, he put on his shot cranberry-coloured swallow-tail coat, then his overcoat lined with thick bearskin; then, supported first on one side and then on the other by the waiter, he went downstairs and got into his chaise. The chaise drove rumbling out of the gates of the hotel into the street. A passing priest took off his hat, some street urchins in dirty shirts held out their hands, saying, “Something for a poor orphan, sir!” The coachman, noticing that one of them was very zealous to stand on the footboard, gave him a lash with the whip, and the chaise went jolting over the cobble stones. It was not without relief that our hero saw in the distance the striped barrier post that indicated that to the cobbled road as to every form of torture there would soon be an end, and after striking his head rather violently against the sides of the chaise two or three times more, Tchitchikov glided at last over the soft earth. As soon as the town was left behind, all sorts of wild rubbish and litter made its appearance on both sides of the road, as is usually the case in Russia: mounds of earth, firwoods, low scanty thickets of young pines, the charred stumps of old ones, wild heather and such stuff. They came upon villages consisting of a string of huts, looking like old timber shacks, covered with grey roofs with carvings under them, that resembled embroidered towels. As usual a few peasants sat gaping on benches in front of their gates, dressed in their sheepskins; peasant women, tightly girt above the bosom, showed their fat faces at the upper windows; from the lower ones a calf stared or a pig poked out its small-eyed snout. In short, there were the familiar sights. After driving about ten miles our hero remembered that from Manilov’s account his village ought to be here, but the eleventh mile was passed and still the village was not to be seen, and if they had not happened to meet two peasants they could hardly have reached their destination.","For more than two weeks the visitor lived amid a round of evening parties and dinners; wherefore he spent (as the saying goes) a very pleasant time. Finally he decided to extend his visits beyond the urban boundaries by going and calling upon landowners Manilov and Sobakevitch, seeing that he had promised on his honour to do so. Yet what really incited him to this may have been a more essential cause, a matter of greater gravity, a purpose which stood nearer to his heart, than the motive which I have just given; and of that purpose the reader will learn if only he will have the patience to read this prefatory narrative (which, lengthy though it be, may yet develop and expand in proportion as we approach the denouement with which the present work is destined to be crowned). One evening, therefore, Selifan the coachman received orders to have the horses harnessed in good time next morning; while Petrushka received orders to remain behind, for the purpose of looking after the portmanteau and the room. In passing, the reader may care to become more fully acquainted with the two serving-men of whom I have spoken. Naturally, they were not persons of much note, but merely what folk call characters of secondary, or even of tertiary, importance. Yet, despite the fact that the springs and the thread of this romance will not DEPEND upon them, but only touch upon them, and occasionally include them, the author has a passion for circumstantiality, and, like the average Russian, such a desire for accuracy as even a German could not rival. To what the reader already knows concerning the personages in hand it is therefore necessary to add that Petrushka usually wore a cast-off brown jacket of a size too large for him, as also that he had (according to the custom of individuals of his calling) a pair of thick lips and a very prominent nose. In temperament he was taciturn rather than loquacious, and he cherished a yearning for self-education. That is to say, he loved to read books, even though their contents came alike to him whether they were books of heroic adventure or mere grammars or liturgical compendia. As I say, he perused every book with an equal amount of attention, and, had he been offered a work on chemistry, would have accepted that also. Not the words which he read, but the mere solace derived from the act of reading, was what especially pleased his mind; even though at any moment there might launch itself from the page some devil-sent word whereof he could make neither head nor tail. For the most part, his task of reading was performed in a recumbent position in the anteroom; which circumstance ended by causing his mattress to become as ragged and as thin as a wafer. In addition to his love of poring over books, he could boast of two habits which constituted two other essential features of his character—namely, a habit of retiring to rest in his clothes (that is to say, in the brown jacket above-mentioned) and a habit of everywhere bearing with him his own peculiar atmosphere, his own peculiar smell—a smell which filled any lodging with such subtlety that he needed but to make up his bed anywhere, even in a room hitherto untenanted, and to drag thither his greatcoat and other impedimenta, for that room at once to assume an air of having been lived in during the past ten years. Nevertheless, though a fastidious, and even an irritable, man, Chichikov would merely frown when his nose caught this smell amid the freshness of the morning, and exclaim with a toss of his head: “The devil only knows what is up with you! Surely you sweat a good deal, do you not? The best thing you can do is to go and take a bath.” To this Petrushka would make no reply, but, approaching, brush in hand, the spot where his master’s coat would be pendent, or starting to arrange one and another article in order, would strive to seem wholly immersed in his work. Yet of what was he thinking as he remained thus silent? Perhaps he was saying to himself: “My master is a good fellow, but for him to keep on saying the same thing forty times over is a little wearisome.” Only God knows and sees all things; wherefore for a mere human being to know what is in the mind of a servant while his master is scolding him is wholly impossible. However, no more need be said about Petrushka. On the other hand, Coachman Selifan— But here let me remark that I do not like engaging the reader’s attention in connection with persons of a lower class than himself; for experience has taught me that we do not willingly familiarise ourselves with the lower orders—that it is the custom of the average Russian to yearn exclusively for information concerning persons on the higher rungs of the social ladder. In fact, even a bowing acquaintance with a prince or a lord counts, in his eyes, for more than do the most intimate of relations with ordinary folk. For the same reason the author feels apprehensive on his hero’s account, seeing that he has made that hero a mere Collegiate Councillor—a mere person with whom Aulic Councillors might consort, but upon whom persons of the grade of full General 8 would probably bestow one of those glances proper to a man who is cringing at their august feet. Worse still, such persons of the grade of General are likely to treat Chichikov with studied negligence—and to an author studied negligence spells death. However, in spite of the distressfulness of the foregoing possibilities, it is time that I returned to my hero. After issuing, overnight, the necessary orders, he awoke early, washed himself, rubbed himself from head to foot with a wet sponge (a performance executed only on Sundays—and the day in question happened to be a Sunday), shaved his face with such care that his cheeks issued of absolutely satin-like smoothness and polish, donned first his bilberry-coloured, spotted frockcoat, and then his bearskin overcoat, descended the staircase (attended, throughout, by the waiter) and entered his britchka. With a loud rattle the vehicle left the inn-yard, and issued into the street. A passing priest doffed his cap, and a few urchins in grimy shirts shouted, “Gentleman, please give a poor orphan a trifle!” Presently the driver noticed that a sturdy young rascal was on the point of climbing onto the splashboard; wherefore he cracked his whip and the britchka leapt forward with increased speed over the cobblestones. At last, with a feeling of relief, the travellers caught sight of macadam ahead, which promised an end both to the cobblestones and to sundry other annoyances. And, sure enough, after his head had been bumped a few more times against the boot of the conveyance, Chichikov found himself bowling over softer ground. On the town receding into the distance, the sides of the road began to be varied with the usual hillocks, fir trees, clumps of young pine, trees with old, scarred trunks, bushes of wild juniper, and so forth. Presently there came into view also strings of country villas which, with their carved supports and grey roofs (the latter looking like pendent, embroidered tablecloths), resembled, rather, bundles of old faggots. Likewise the customary peasants, dressed in sheepskin jackets, could be seen yawning on benches before their huts, while their womenfolk, fat of feature and swathed of bosom, gazed out of upper windows, and the windows below displayed, here a peering calf, and there the unsightly jaws of a pig. In short, the view was one of the familiar type. After passing the fifteenth verst-stone Chichikov suddenly recollected that, according to Manilov, fifteen versts was the exact distance between his country house and the town; but the sixteenth verst stone flew by, and the said country house was still nowhere to be seen. In fact, but for the circumstance that the travellers happened to encounter a couple of peasants, they would have come on their errand in vain.","For more than a week already the newly arrived gentleman had been living in the town, driving about to soirées and dinners and thus passing his time, as they say, very pleasantly. At last he decided to transfer his visits outside of town and call on the landowners Manilov and Sobakevich, to whom he had given his word. Perhaps he was impelled to it by some other, more essential reason, some more serious matter, closer to his heart … But of all that the reader will learn gradually and in due time, if only he has patience enough to read the proffered tale, a very long one, which is to expand more widely and vastly later on, as it nears the end that crowns the matter. The coachman Selifan was given orders to harness the horses to the familiar britzka early in the morning; Petrushka was ordered to stay home, to keep an eye on the room and the trunk. It will not be superfluous here for the reader to make the acquaintance of these two bondsmen of our hero’s. Although, of course, they are not such notable characters, and are what is known as secondary or even tertiary, although the main lines and springs of the poem do not rest on them, and perhaps only occasionally touch and graze them lightly—still, the author is extremely fond of being circumstantial in all things, and in this respect, despite his being a Russian man, he wishes to be as precise as a German. This will not take up much time or space, however, because not much needs to be added to what the reader already knows, to wit, that Petrushka went about in a rather loose brown frock coat from his master’s back and had, as is customary for people of his station in life, a large nose and lips. He was more taciturn than talkative in character; he even had a noble impulse for enlightenment, that is, for reading books, the content of which did not trouble him: it made absolutely no difference to him whether it was the adventures of some amorous hero, a simple primer, or a prayer book—he read everything with equal attention; if they slipped him chemistry, he would not refuse that either. He liked not so much what he was reading about as the reading itself, or, better, the process of reading, the fact that letters are eternally forming some word, which sometimes even means the devil knows what. This reading was accomplished mostly in a recumbent position in the anteroom, on a bed and a mattress which, owing to this circumstance, was beaten down and thin as a flapjack. Besides a passion for reading, he had two further customs, which constituted two more of his characteristic traits: to sleep without undressing, just as he was, in the same frock coat; and always to have about him a sort of personal atmosphere of his own peculiar smell, somewhat reminiscent of living quarters, so that it was enough for him merely to set up his bed somewhere, even in a hitherto uninhabited room, and haul his overcoat and chattels there, for it to seem that people had been living there for ten years. Chichikov, being a most ticklish man and even on occasion a finical one, when he drew in air through a fresh nose in the morning, would only wince and toss his head, saying: “Devil knows, brother, you’re sweating or something. You ought to go to a bathhouse.” To which Petrushka made no reply and straightaway tried to busy himself somehow: either approaching his master’s hanging tailcoat with a brush, or simply putting things in order. What he was thinking all the while he stood there silently —perhaps he was saying to himself: “And you’re a good one, too, aren’t you sick of repeating the same thing forty times?”—God knows, it is hard to tell what a household serf is thinking while his master admonishes him. And so, that is what can be said for a start about Petrushka. The coachman Selifan was a totally different man … But the author is most ashamed to occupy his readers for so long with people of low class, knowing from experience how reluctantly they make acquaintance with the lower estate. Such is the Russian man: strong is his passion for knowing someone at least one rank above himself, and a nodding acquaintance with a count or prince is better to him than any close relations with friends. The author even fears for his hero, who is only a collegiate councillor. Court councillors may well make his acquaintance, but those who are already nearing the rank of general, these, God knows, may even cast at him one of those contemptuous glances a man proudly casts at all that grovels at his feet, or, worse still, pass over him with an inattention deadly for the author. But, however lamentable the one and the other, it is nevertheless necessary for us to return to our hero. And so, having given the necessary orders the evening before, having awakened very early in the morning, having washed, having wiped himself from head to foot with a wet sponge, a thing done only on Sundays—and this day happened to be a Sunday—having shaved in such a way that his cheeks became real satin as regards smoothness and lustre, having put on a cranberry-colored tailcoat with flecks and then an overcoat lined with bearskin, he descended the stairs, supported under his elbow now on one side, now on the other, by the tavern servant, and got into the britzka. With a rumble, the britzka drove through the gates of the inn to the street. A passing priest took off his hat, several urchins in dirty shirts held their hands out, murmuring: “Master, give to the little orphan!” The coachman, noticing that one of them was an avid footboard rider, lashed him with his whip, and the britzka went bouncing off over the cobbles. Not without joy was the striped tollgate beheld in the distance, letting it be known that the pavement, like any other torment, would soon come to an end; and after a few more good hard bumps of his head against the sides, Chichikov was at last racing over soft ground. No sooner had the town dropped back than all sorts of stuff and nonsense, as is usual with us, began scrawling itself along both sides of the road: tussocks, fir trees, low skimpy stands of young pines, charred trunks of old ones, wild heather, and similar gibberish. Strung-out villages happened by, their architecture resembling old stacks of firewood, covered with gray roofs with cutout wooden decorations under them, looking like embroidered towels hanging down. Several muzhiks yawned, as is their custom, sitting on benches before the gates in their sheepskin coats. Women with fat faces and tightly bound bosoms looked out of upper windows; out of the lower ones a calf peeked or a sow stuck her blind snout. Familiar sights, in short. Having driven past the tenth milestone, he recalled that, according to Manilov’s words, his estate should be here, but the eleventh mile flew by and the estate was still nowhere to be seen, and had it not been for two muzhiks they met, things would hardly have gone well for them.","The newly arrived gentleman had been living in the town for more than a week by now, driving about to attend modest evenings-at-home and dinners and in that manner passing his time, as the expression goes, very pleasantly. Finally he decided to extend his visits beyond the town and to call on Manilov and Sobakevich, the landowners to whom he had given his word he would. Perhaps he was urged to do so by another, more essential reason; a matter more serious, nearer his heart... . But concerning all this the readers will find out by degrees and in its own due time, if they will only have the patience to read the narrative offered them—a very long one, which has yet to expand more sweepingly and broadly as it draws to that end which crowns the matter. An order was issued to Selifan the coachman to harness the horses in the familiar carriage early in the morning; Petrushka the flunky was ordered to stay at home, to keep an eye on the room and the small trunk. It would not be superfluous for the reader to make the acquaintance of these two bondmen of our hero’s. Even though, of course, they are not such very prominent personae and belong to what is called the secondary or even the tertiary category, and even though the chief actions and mainsprings of this epic are not based upon them and may concern and implicate them but lightly here and there, yet the author is exceedingly fond of being circumstantial in all things, and even though he himself is a native of Russia, he wishes, in this respect, to be as thoroughgoing as any German. This, however, will not take up very much time and space, since it will not be necessary to add a great deal to that which the reader already knows—to wit, that Petrushka wore a loose brown frock coat that was a hand-me-down from his master, and that he had, as is usually the way among people of his calling, a nose and lips done on a large scale. He was by temperament taciturn rather than talkative; he even had a noble impulse toward enlightenment—i.e., the reading of books, the contents of which presented no difficulty to him whatsoever; it was all one to him if the book dealt with the adventures of an enamored hero or whether it was simply a dictionary or a prayer book—he read everything with the same attentiveness; if a handbook on chemistry were to be thrust under his nose he wouldn’t have spurned it either. It wasn’t what he read that pleased him, but more the reading itself or, to put it better, the very process of reading—lo and behold, some word or other inevitably emerged out of the welter of letters, even though, at times, the Devil alone knew what that word might mean. This reading was generally performed in a recumbent position, in the entry, on his cot and pallet; the latter, owing to this circumstance, had become beat-up and as thin as a wafer. Besides his passion for reading, he had two more habits that comprised his other characteristic traits: that of sleeping without undressing, just as he was, in that very selfsame frock coat, and of always having about him a certain atmosphere that was peculiarly his own, his very own smell, somewhat redolent of quarters that had been long lived in, so that it sufficed for him merely to set up his cot somewhere, even in a room that had not up to then been lived in, and to drag his overcoat and worldly goods into it, and it would immediately seem that people had been living in that room for ten years or so. Chichikov, being quite a sensitive man, and even in certain cases downright squeamish, upon drawing in a whiff of the air in the morning, through a nose refreshed by slumber, could only make a wry face and say, after a shake of his head: “The Devil alone knows what you’re up to, brother; you’re sweating, or something. You ought to go to a public bath, at least.” To which Petrushka would make no reply and try to busy himself with some immediate task: he would either pick up a clothesbrush and go to where his master’s frock coat was hung up, or simply begin tidying up something or other. What were his thoughts while he went silently about his tasks? He may have been saying to himself: “You’re a fine fellow, too; you never get bored with saying the same old thing over and over and over....” God knows, it is hard to know what a domestic serf thinks about while the man who owns him gives him a lecture. And there, for a start, you have what can be told about Petrushka. Selifan the coachman was an altogether different sort of man... . However, the author is quite conscience-stricken about taking up the time of his readers for so long with people of a low class, knowing by experience how unwilling they are to be introduced to the low strata of society. For that’s how the Russian is: he has an overwhelming passion for scraping up an acquaintance with him who may be but a single step above him in rank, while a nodding acquaintance with a count or a prince is for him a better thing than to be on the most intimate terms with a real friend. The author actually feels dubious about his hero, who is only a mere Collegiate Councilor, after all. There is a likelihood that court councilors, say, may condescend to know him; but as for those who have already clambered up the grades of General This and General That, these, God knows, may even bestow upon him one of those contemptuous looks which man proudly bestows upon anything that may be crawling like vermin at his feet, or, which would be still worse, will pass him by with an unconcern that would be lethal for the author. However, no matter how exceedingly grievous either the one procedure or the other would be, we still must come back to our hero. And so, having issued the necessary orders the evening before, after awaking very early in the morning, after a wash-up and a sponge bath from head to foot (something that was ordinarily gone through only on Sundays, and this day happening to be a Sunday), after shaving himself so closely that his cheeks became truly satinlike, as far as smoothness and glossiness were concerned, and donning his frock coat of scintillating lingonberry hue, and then a greatcoat lined with selected bearskins, he at last descended the stairs, supported now on this side, now on that, by the tavern servant and seated himself in his light carriage. The said carriage thundered out of the gates of the inn and into the street. A priest who was passing by doffed his hat; several street urchins in thoroughly soiled shirts held out their hands, to a chorus of “Kind Sir, give something to a poor orphan!” The coachman, having noticed that one of them had a great fondness for hitching on behind, lashed him with his whip, and the carriage was off, bouncing over the cobbles. Not without joy did Chichikov behold the striped tollgate in the distance, informing him that the paved way, like every other torture, would soon be at an end; and, after having bumped his head quite hard a few more times against the body of the vehicle, he was at last rolling along on soft earth. Hardly had the town retreated when (quite the usual thing among us) there unrolled on both sides of the road vistas of a wild pre-posterousness: hummocks; fir groves; small, squat, sparse undergrowths of young pines; charred stumps of old ones; wild heather; and suchlike nonsensical rubbish. One came upon villages all strung out in a single line, with huts that looked like weather-beaten woodpiles covered over with gray roofs, the wooden fretwork decorations underneath them resembling hanging towels with embroidered designs. A few muzhiks in short sheepskin jackets were, as usual, yawning as they squatted on benches placed before the gates; countrywives, with stout faces and their breasts caught up by shawls, were looking out of the upper windows; out of a lower window a calf would peer, or a sow might be poking out its unseeing snout. In brief, the sights were of a thoroughly familiar nature. Having passed the tenth mile, Chichikov recalled that, according to Manilov, his village must be thereabouts, but the eleventh mile flew by as well and yet the village was still not to be seen, and, had it not been for two muzhiks that they chanced to come upon, Chichikov and his coachman would hardly have hit upon the right direction."

"На другой день все обделалось как нельзя лучше. Костанжогло дал с радостью десять тысяч без процентов, без поручительства — просто под одну расписку. Так был он готов помогать всякому на пути к приобретенью. Этого мало: он сам взялся сопровождать Чичикова к Хлобуеву, с тем чтобы осмотреть вместе с ним имение. После сытного завтрака все они отправились, севши все трое в коляску Павла Ивановича; пролетки хозяина следовали порожняком за ними. Ярб бежал впереди, сгоняя с дороги птиц. В полтора часа с небольшим сделали они восемнадцать верст и увидели деревушку с двумя домами. Один большой и новый, недостроенный и остававшийся вчерне несколько лет, другой маленький и старенький. Хозяина нашли они растрепанного, заспанного, недавно проснувшегося; на сюртуке у него была заплата, а на сапоге дырка.","The next day everything worked out for the best. Costanjoglo gladly gave ten thousand without interest, without guarantee - just under one receipt. So he was ready to help everyone on the way to gain. This is not enough: he himself undertook to accompany Chichikov to Khlobuev in order to inspect the estate with him. After a hearty breakfast they all set off, all three of them getting into Pavel Ivanovich's carriage; the host's cabs followed them empty. Yarb ran ahead, driving the birds out of the way. In a little over an hour and a half they made eighteen miles and saw a village with two houses. One is large and new, unfinished and left in the rough for several years, the other is small and old. They found the owner disheveled, sleepy, recently awakened; he had a patch on his coat, and a hole in his boot.","The next day everything was arranged most successfully. Skudronzhoglo was delighted to lend ten thousand roubles without interest or security, simply upon a signed receipt: so ready was he to help any one on to the way of prosperity. That was not all: he undertook to accompany Tchitchikov to Hlobuev‘s, in order to look over the latter’s estate with him. After a substantial breakfast they set off all three in Pavel Ivanovitch’s carriage; Skudronzhoglo’s racing droshky followed empty. Yarb ran on ahead, chasing the birds off the road. They did the twelve miles in a little over an hour and a half and then caught sight of a small village with two houses—a big new one that was unfinished and had remained in the rough for many years, and a little old one. They found the owner very untidy and sleepy, as he was only just awake; there was a patch on his coat and holes in his boots.","Next day, with Platon and Constantine, Chichikov set forth to interview Khlobuev, the owner whose estate Constantine had consented to help Chichikov to purchase with a non-interest-bearing, uncovenanted loan of ten thousand roubles. Naturally, our hero was in the highest of spirits. For the first fifteen versts or so the road led through forest land and tillage belonging to Platon and his brother-in-law; but directly the limit of these domains was reached, forest land began to be replaced with swamp, and tillage with waste. Also, the village in Khlobuev’s estate had about it a deserted air, and as for the proprietor himself, he was discovered in a state of drowsy dishevelment, having not long left his bed. A man of about forty, he had his cravat crooked, his frockcoat adorned with a large stain, and one of his boots worn through.","The next day everything was arranged in the best possible way. Kostanzhoglo gladly gave him the ten thousand without interest, without security—simply with a receipt. So ready he was to assist anyone on the path to acquisition. Not only that: he himself undertook to accompany Chichikov to Khlobuev’s, so as to look the estate over. After a substantial breakfast, they all set out, having climbed all three into Pavel Ivanovich’s carriage; the host’s droshky followed empty behind. Yarb ran ahead, chasing birds off the road. In a little over an hour and a half, they covered ten miles and saw a small estate with two houses. One of them, big and new, was unfinished and had remained in that rough state for several years; the other was small and old. They found the owner disheveled, sleepy, just awakened; there was a patch on his frock coat and a hole in his boot.",

"— Что ж, душа моя, — сказал Собакевич, — если б я сам это делал, но я тебе прямо в глаза скажу, что я гадостей не стану есть. Мне лягушку хоть сахаром облепи, не возьму ее в рот, и устрицы тоже не возьму: я знаю, на что устрица похожа. Возьмите барана, — продолжал он, обращаясь к Чичикову, — это бараний бок с кашей! Это не те фрикасе, что делаются на барских кухнях из баранины, какая суток по четыре на рынке валяется! Это все выдумали доктора немцы да французы, я бы их перевешал за это! Выдумали диету, лечить голодом! Что у них немецкая жидкостная натура, так они воображают, что и с русским желудком сладят! Нет, это все не то, это всё выдумки, это всё… — Здесь Собакевич даже сердито покачал головою. — Толкуют: просвещенье, просвещенье, а это просвещенье — фук! Сказал бы и другое слово, да вот только что за столом неприлично. У меня не так. У меня когда свинина — всю свинью давай на стол, баранина — всего барана тащи, гусь — всего гуся! Лучше я съем двух блюд, да съем в меру, как душа требует. — Собакевич подтвердил это делом: он опрокинул половину бараньего бока к себе на тарелку, съел все, обгрыз, обсосал до последней косточки.","“Well, my soul,” said Sobakevich, “if I did it myself, I’ll tell you straight to your face that I won’t eat nasty things.” Put some sugar on the frog for me, I won’t take it in my mouth, and I won’t take oysters either: I know what an oyster looks like. Take a ram,” he continued, turning to Chichikov, “this is a side of mutton with porridge!” These are not the fricassees that are made in the master's kitchens from lamb, which is lying around on the market for four days! All this was invented by the Germans and the French doctors, I would hang them for this! Invented a diet, treat hunger! That they have a German liquid nature, so they imagine that they can cope with the Russian stomach! No, it's all wrong, it's all fiction, it's all ... - Here Sobakevich even shook his head angrily. - They say: enlightenment, enlightenment, and this enlightenment - poof! I would say another word, but that's just indecent at the table. I don't. When I have pork - put the whole pig on the table, lamb - drag the whole ram, goose - just the goose! I'd rather eat two dishes, but eat in moderation, as my soul requires. - Sobakevich confirmed this with a deed: he tipped half a lamb side onto his plate, ate it all, gnawed it, sucked it to the last bone.","“Well, my love,” said Sobakevitch, “if I did the same myself, you might complain, but I tell you straight that I am not going to eat filth. If you sprinkle frogs with sugar I wouldn’t put them into my mouth, and I wouldn’t taste oysters, either: I know what oysters are like. Take some mutton,” he went on, addressing Tchitchikov. “This is saddle of mutton with grain, not the fricassees that they make in gentlemen’s kitchens out of mutton which has been lying about in the marketplace for days. The French and German doctors have invented all that; I’d have them all hanged for it. They have invented a treatment too, the hunger cure! Because they have a thin-blooded German constitution, they fancy they can treat the Russian stomach too. No, it’s all wrong, it’s all their fancies, it’s all . . .” Here Sobakevitch shook his head wrathfully “They talk of enlightenment, enlightenment, and this enlightenment is ... faugh! I might use another word for it but it would be improper at the dinner table. It is not like that in my house. If we have pork we put the whole pig on the table, if it’s mutton, we bring in the whole sheep, if it’s a goose, the whole goose! I had rather eat only two dishes, and eat my fill of them.” Sobakevitch confirmed this in practice; he put half a saddle of mutton on his plate and ate it all, gnawing and sucking every little bone.","“I tell you straight that I would not eat such nastiness, even had I made it myself. Sugar a frog as much as you like, but never shall it pass MY lips. Nor would I swallow an oyster, for I know only too well what an oyster may resemble. But have some mutton, friend Chichikov. It is shoulder of mutton, and very different stuff from the mutton which they cook in noble kitchens—mutton which has been kicking about the market-place four days or more. All that sort of cookery has been invented by French and German doctors, and I should like to hang them for having done so. They go and prescribe diets and a hunger cure as though what suits their flaccid German systems will agree with a Russian stomach! Such devices are no good at all.” Sobakevitch shook his head wrathfully. “Fellows like those are for ever talking of civilisation. As if THAT sort of thing was civilisation! Phew!” (Perhaps the speaker’s concluding exclamation would have been even stronger had he not been seated at table.) “For myself, I will have none of it. When I eat pork at a meal, give me the WHOLE pig; when mutton, the WHOLE sheep; when goose, the WHOLE of the bird. Two dishes are better than a thousand, provided that one can eat of them as much as one wants.” And he proceeded to put precept into practice by taking half the shoulder of mutton on to his plate, and then devouring it down to the last morsel of gristle and bone.","“But, my sweet,” said Sobakevich, “it’s not as if I were doing it myself, but I’ll tell you right to your face, I will not eat any vileness. No frog, even if it’s pasted all over with sugar, will ever go near my mouth, and no oyster either : I know what oysters are like. Take this lamb,” he went on, addressing Chichikov, “this is a rack of lamb with buckwheat groats! It’s not that fricassee they make in squires’ kitchens out of lamb that’s been lying around the marketplace for four days! It was German and French doctors who invented it all, I’d have the whole lot of them hung for it! They invented the diet, the hunger treatment! With their thin-boned German nature, they fancy they can take on the Russian stomach, too! No, it’s all wrong, all these inventions, it’s all …” Here Sobakevich even shook his head angrily. “They say: enlightenment, enlightenment, and this enlightenment—poof! I’d use another word, only it wouldn’t be proper at the table. With me it’s not like that. With me, if it’s pork—let’s have the whole pig on the table, if it’s lamb—drag in the whole sheep, if goose—the whole goose! Better that I eat just two courses, but eat my fill, as my soul demands.” Sobakevich confirmed this in action: he dumped half of the rack of lamb onto his own plate, ate it all up, gnawed it, and sucked it out to the last little bone.","“Well, now, my pet,” Sobakevich persisted, “if I did things like that myself it would be a different matter, but I’m telling you right to your face that I’m not going to eat any abominations. You can plaster frogs’ legs even with sugar, as far as I’m concerned, and I won’t take ’em into my mouth, nor will I take oysters, for that matter— an oyster’s looks remind me too much of something else. Take some of the mutton,” he went on, turning to Chichikov; “it’s a whole side of mutton, with buckwheat groats. These aren’t your fricassees, which are made in lordly kitchens out of mutton that’s been knocking around on the market stalls for four days in a row. It’s all a scheme thought up by the German and the French doctors; if I had my way, I’d string up all of ’em. They’ve thought up dieting, the hunger cure! Since theirs is a watery German constitution, they imagine they’ll make the thing work with the Russian stomach! No, it’s all wrong, it’s all pure invention, it’s all—” At this point Sobakevich even shook his head angrily. “They’re forever talking about enlightenment, enlightenment, but all this enlightenment is just so much . . . flapdoodle! I might even use another word, only it would be impolite at table. I don’t do things that way. If it’s pork I want, I order the whole swine to be served at table; if it’s mutton, drag in the whole ram; if a goose, the whole goose! Better for me if I eat but two courses, but eat a goodly enough portion of each, as the soul craves.” Sobakevich confirmed this by action: he overturned half the side of mutton onto his plate and ate it all up, gnawing clean and sucking dry every last bit of a bone."

I have a wretched little bit of land and the peasants are lazy, they are not fond of work, they are always trying to get off to the tavern.... If I don’t look out, I shall be begging my bread in my old age!”","“Also,” went on Plushkin, “I am ashamed to say that hardly a wisp of fodder does the place contain. But how can I get fodder? My lands are small, and the peasantry lazy fellows who hate work and think of nothing but the tavern. In the end, therefore, I shall be forced to go and spend my old age in roaming about the world.”","“And, such a nasty story, there’s not a wisp of hay on the whole estate!” Plyushkin went on. “And how, indeed, can one save any?—wretched little piece of land, lazy muzhiks, don’t like to work at all, dream only of the pot-house … I’m afraid I’ll find myself a beggar in my old age.”","“And what vile luck, there isn’t as much as a wisp of hay on the whole place!” Pliushkin continued.” And, really, how is one to store it up? There’s so little land; the muzhik is lazy, not overfond of work; all he thinks of is how he might sneak off to the tavern .. . like as not, one may have to go out into the world and beg in one’s old age!”"

Selifan turned with such a dry question to the girl sitting next to him, showing her with a whip along the road blackened from the rain between the bright green, illuminated fields.","“To the right?” was the curt question Selifan addressed to the girl sitting beside him, as he pointed with his whip towards the rain-darkened road between the fresh bright green fields.","“To the right, eh?” snapped Selifan to the girl beside him as he pointed to a rain-soaked road which trended away through fresh green fields.","“To the right, is it?” With this dry question Selifan turned to the girl sitting next to him, and pointed with his whip to a rain-blackened road between bright green, freshened fields.","“Do we go to the right now?” Selifan turned to the little girl seated beside him, putting the question in the driest of tones and pointing out to her with his whip the road, darkened from the rain, between the vividly green rain-freshened fields."

"Пока приезжий господин осматривал свою комнату, внесены были его пожитки: прежде всего чемодан из белой кожи, несколько по истасканный, показывавший, что был не в первый раз в дороге. Чемодан внесли кучер Селифан, низенький человек в тулупчике, и лакей Петрушка, малый лет тридцати, в просторном подержанном сюртуке, как видно с барского плеча, малый немного суровый на взгляд, с очень крупными губами и носом. Вслед за чемоданом внесен был небольшой ларчик красного дерева с штучными выкладками из карельской березы, сапожные колодки и завернутая в синюю бумагу жареная курица. Когда все это было внесено, кучер Селифан отправился на конюшню возиться около лошадей, а лакей Петрушка стал устраиваться в маленькой передней, очень темной конурке, куда уже успел притащить свою шинель и вместе с нею какой-то свой собственный запах, который был сообщен и принесенному вслед за тем мешку с разным лакейским туалетом. В этой конурке он приладил к стене узенькую трехногую кровать, накрыв ее небольшим подобием тюфяка, убитым и плоским, как блин, и, может быть, так же замаслившимся, как блин, который удалось ему вытребовать у хозяина гостиницы.","While the visiting gentleman was inspecting his room, his belongings were brought in: first of all, a suitcase made of white leather, somewhat worn, showing that it was not the first time on the road. The suitcase was brought in by the coachman Selifan, a short man in a sheepskin coat, and the footman Petrushka, a fellow of about thirty, in a spacious second-hand frock coat, as can be seen from the master's shoulder, the fellow is a little stern in his eyes, with very large lips and nose. Following the suitcase was brought in a small mahogany chest lined with Karelian birch, shoe lasts, and a fried chicken wrapped in blue paper. When all this was brought in, the coachman Selifan went to the stable to mess about with the horses, and the footman Petrushka began to settle in a small front, very dark kennel, where he had already managed to drag his overcoat and, along with it, some kind of his own smell, which was also communicated to the brought followed by a sack with various footmen's toilets. In this kennel he fixed a narrow three-legged bed against the wall, covering it with a small semblance of a mattress, dead and flat as a pancake, and perhaps as greasy as a pancake, which he managed to extort from the innkeeper.","While the new-comer was inspecting his room, his luggage was carried up: first of all, a portmanteau of white leather, somewhat worn and evidently not on its first journey. The portmanteau was brought in by his coachman Selifan, a little man in sheepskin, and his footman Petrushka, a fellow of thirty, somewhat sullen looking, with very thick lips and nose, wearing a rather shabby loose frock-coat that had evidently been his master’s. After the portmanteau they carried up a small mahogany chest inlaid with hard birch, a pair of boot-trees, and a roast fowl wrapped up in blue paper. When all this had been brought in, the coachman Selifan went to the stables to look after the horses, while the footman Petrushka proceeded to instal himself in a little lobby, a very dark little cupboard, into which he had already conveyed his overcoat and with it his own peculiar odour which was communicated also to the sack containing various articles for his flunkey toilet, which he brought up next. In this cupboard he put up against the wall a narrow three-legged bedstead, covering it with a small travesty of a mattress, crushed as flat as a pancake, and perhaps as greasy, too, which he had succeeded in begging from the hotel-keeper.","During the traveller’s inspection of his room his luggage was brought into the apartment. First came a portmanteau of white leather whose raggedness indicated that the receptacle had made several previous journeys. The bearers of the same were the gentleman’s coachman, Selifan (a little man in a large overcoat), and the gentleman’s valet, Petrushka—the latter a fellow of about thirty, clad in a worn, over-ample jacket which formerly had graced his master’s shoulders, and possessed of a nose and a pair of lips whose coarseness communicated to his face rather a sullen expression. Behind the portmanteau came a small dispatch-box of redwood, lined with birch bark, a boot-case, and (wrapped in blue paper) a roast fowl; all of which having been deposited, the coachman departed to look after his horses, and the valet to establish himself in the little dark anteroom or kennel where already he had stored a cloak, a bagful of livery, and his own peculiar smell. Pressing the narrow bedstead back against the wall, he covered it with the tiny remnant of mattress—a remnant as thin and flat (perhaps also as greasy) as a pancake—which he had managed to beg of the landlord of the establishment.","While the visiting gentleman was examining his room, his belongings were brought in: first of all a white leather trunk, somewhat worn, indicating that this was not its first time on the road. The trunk was brought in by the coachman Selifan, a short man in a sheepskin coat, and the lackey Petrushka, a fellow of about thirty in a roomy secondhand frock coat, evidently from his master’s back, a somewhat stern fellow by the look of him, with a very large nose and lips. After the trunk, a small mahogany chest inlaid with Karelian birch was brought in, a boot-tree, and a roast chicken wrapped in blue paper. When all this had been brought in, the coachman Selifan went to the stables to potter with the horses, while the lackey Petrushka began to settle himself in a small anteroom, a very dark closet, where he had already managed to drag his overcoat and with it a certain smell of his own, which had also been imparted to the sack of various lackey toiletries brought in after it. In this closet, he fixed a narrow, three-legged bed to the wall and covered it with a small semblance of a mattress, beaten down and flat as a pancake, and perhaps as greasy as a pancake, which he had managed to extort from the innkeeper.","While the transient gentleman was inspecting his room, his belongings were carried in; first and foremost, a small trunk of white leather, somewhat scuffed, indicating that this was not the first time it had been out on the road. The small trunk was brought in by Selifan, the coachman, a squat little fellow in a short sheepskin coat, and by Petrushka, a flunky, a lad of about thirty in a loose, much-worn frock coat, evidently a hand-me-down from his master’s shoulders, a lad somewhat austere at first glance, whose lips and nose were on a very large scale. After the trunk, they carried in a small chest of mahogany with marquetry of Karelian birch, a pair of shoe trees, and a roasted chicken wrapped up in blue paper. When all these had been carried in, Selifan the coachman set out for the stable to see to the horses, while Petrushka the flunky began settling himself in the tiny anteroom, a very dark cubbyhole, whither he had already brought his overcoat and, together with it, a certain odor all his own, which had been also imparted to the bag he brought in next, containing sundry flunkyish effects. In this cubbyhole he set up against the wall a small and narrow cot with only three legs, putting on top of it a skimpy simulacrum of a pallet, beat-up and as flat as a pancake (and, perhaps, just as greasy), which he had succeeded in wangling out of the owner of the inn."
"Но все это никак не произвело предполагаемого действия на Чичикова. Он даже не смотрел на круги, производимые дамами, но беспрестанно подымался на цыпочки выглядывать поверх голов, куда бы могла забраться занимательная блондинка; приседал и вниз тоже, высматривая промеж плечей и спин, наконец доискался и увидел ее, сидящую вместе с матерью, над которою величаво колебалась какая-то восточная чалма с пером. Казалось, как будто он хотел взять их приступом; весеннее ли расположение подействовало на него, или толкал его кто сзади, только он протеснялся решительно вперед, несмотря ни на что; откупщик получил от него такой толчок, что пошатнулся и чуть-чуть удержался на одной ноге, не то бы, конечно, повалил за собою целый ряд; почтмейстер тоже отступился и посмотрел на него с изумлением, смешанным с довольно тонкой иронией, но он на них не поглядел; он видел только вдали блондинку, надевавшую длинную перчатку и, без сомнения, сгоравшую желанием пуститься летать по паркету. А уж там в стороне четыре пары откалывали мазурку; каблуки ломали пол, и армейский штабс-капитан работал и душою и телом, и руками и ногами, отвертывая такие па, какие и во сне никому не случалось отвертывать. Чичиков прошмыгнул мимо мазурки почти по самым каблукам и прямо к тому месту, где сидела губернаторша с дочкой. Однако ж он подступил к ним очень робко, не семенил так бойко и франтовски ногами, даже несколько замялся, и во всех движениях оказалась какая-то неловкость.","But all this did not produce the intended effect on Chichikov. He did not even look at the circles made by the ladies, but constantly rose on tiptoe to look over their heads, where the entertaining blonde might climb; he squatted down, too, looking between the shoulders and backs, finally found his way and saw her sitting with her mother, over whom some kind of oriental turban with a feather was majestically swaying. It seemed as if he wanted to take them by storm; whether the spring disposition had an effect on him, or someone pushed him from behind, only he resolutely pushed forward, in spite of everything; the farmer received from him such a push that he staggered and barely managed to stay on one leg, otherwise, of course, he would have knocked down a whole row behind him; the postmaster also stepped back and looked at him with astonishment, mingled with rather subtle irony, but he did not look at them; all he saw in the distance was a blond woman putting on a long glove and, no doubt, burning with a desire to start flying across the parquet. And there, aside, four couples were chipping away a mazurka; the heels broke the floor, and the army staff captain worked with his soul and body, and with his hands and feet, unscrewing such pas that no one had ever unscrewed in a dream. Chichikov darted past the mazurka almost on the very heels and straight to the place where the governor's wife was sitting with her daughter. However, he approached them very timidly, did not mince his feet so smartly and smartly, even hesitated a little, and in all his movements there appeared some kind of awkwardness.","But all this did not produce the effect anticipated on Tchitchikov. He did not even look at the circles described by the ladies, but was continually rising on tiptoe to peep over people’s heads, and see where the interesting fair one had gone; he stooped down too, to look between backs and shoulders; at last his search was successful, and he saw her sitting with her mother, on whose head a sort of oriental turban with a feather was nodding majestically. He seemed to mean to take them by storm. Whether the influence of spring affected him or some one was pushing from behind, he pressed resolutely forward, regardless of everything: the spirit tax contractor was so violently pushed aside by him, that he staggered and only just succeeded in balancing himself on one leg, or he would have brought a whole row of others down with him; the postmaster too stepped back and looked at him in amazement mixed with rather subtle irony, but he did not look at them: he saw nothing but the fair girl in the distance, pulling on a long glove, and no doubt burning with impatience to be flying over the parquet floor. And already four couples were dancing the mazurka,cv heels were tapping on the floor, and an army captain was working hard with body and soul, and arms and legs, executing such steps as no one had ever executed before in his wildest dreams. Tchitchikov dashed by the mazurka almost on the dancers’ heels, and straight to the place where the governor’s wife was sitting with her daughter. He approached them, however, very timidly, he did not trip up to them with jaunty and foppish little steps, he even shifted from one foot to the other uneasily, and there was an awkwardness in all his movements.","But Chichikov never even noticed him; he saw in the distance only the golden-haired beauty. At that moment she was drawing on a long glove and, doubtless, pining to be flying over the dancing-floor, where, with clicking heels, four couples had now begun to thread the mazes of the mazurka. In particular was a military staff-captain working body and soul and arms and legs to compass such a series of steps as were never before performed, even in a dream. However, Chichikov slipped past the mazurka dancers, and, almost treading on their heels, made his way towards the spot where Madame and her daughter were seated. Yet he approached them with great diffidence and none of his late mincing and prancing. Nay, he even faltered as he walked; his every movement had about it an air of awkwardness.","But all this in no way produced the intended effect on Chichikov. He was not even looking at the turns produced by the ladies, but was constantly getting on tiptoe to seek over the heads where the engaging blonde might have gotten to; he also crouched down, looking between shoulders and backs, and finally succeeded in his search and spotted her sitting with her mother, above whom some sort of oriental turban with a feather swayed majestically. It seemed as if he wanted to take them by storm; whether it was a spring mood affecting him, or someone was pushing him from behind, in any case he was decidedly pressing forward despite all; the tax farmer got such a shove from him that he staggered and barely managed to keep himself on one leg, otherwise he certainly would have brought down a whole row along with him; the postmaster also stepped back and looked at him with amazement, mingled with rather subtle irony, but he did not look at them; all he saw was the blond girl in the distance, putting on a long glove and undoubtedly burning with desire to start flying over the parquet. And there, to one side, four couples were already jigging away at the mazurka; heels were smashing the floor, and one army staff captain was working body and soul, and arms, and legs, pulling off such steps as no one had ever pulled off before even in a dream. Chichikov slipped past the mazurka almost right on their heels, and made straight for the place where the governor’s wife sat with her daughter. However, he approached them very timidly, did not mince his steps so perkily and foppishly, even became somewhat confused, and in all his movements showed a certain awkwardness.","But all these maneuvers utterly failed to make the intended impression on Chichikov. He didn’t so much as look at the figures the ladies performed as they danced but kept ceaselessly rising on tiptoes to see if he could find where the engrossing blonde had gone; he bent his knees a little, too, keeping a sharp lookout between the shoulders and backs of the dancers; finally his search was successful and he caught sight of her, sitting together with her mother, over whose head some sort of feathered oriental turban was majestically swaying. Apparently he wanted to take them by frontal assault. Whether it was the mood of spring that affected him, or whether someone was pushing him from behind, the fact remains that he resolutely pressed forward, regardless of everything. The tax-farmer received such a shove from him that he staggered and barely managed to balance himself upright on one foot: if he hadn’t succeeded in doing so, he would have toppled over a whole row of others after him. The Postmaster also had to step back and looked at Chichikov in amazement, not unmixed with rather fine irony, but Chichikov did not even glance at these officials : he had eyes only for the blonde in the distance, who was pulling on a long glove and, beyond a doubt, was all consumed with a desire to be off whirling over the parquet floor. For in the meantime, over to one side, four couples were going through a mazurka; their heels were splintering the floor, while an army officer (a second captain, to be precise), putting into his work body as well as soul, arms as well as legs, was performing such steps as no one had ever chanced to perform even in a dream. Chichikov darted past the mazurka, almost at the very heels of the dancers, and made directly for the spot where the Governor’s lady and her daughter were sitting. However, he approached them with the utmost timidity; he did not mince along nimbly and gallantly as before; he had become a little halting, even, and some sort of awkwardness evinced itself in all his movements."

"— Да как сколько? Многие умирали с тех пор, — сказал приказчик и при этом икнул, заслонив рот слегка рукою, наподобие щитка.","- Yes, how much? Many have died since then,” said the clerk, and at the same time he hiccupped, covering his mouth slightly with his hand, like a shield.","“How many? A good many have died since then,” said the steward, and he hiccoughed, putting his hand before his mouth like a shield.","Why, a great many.” The bailiff hiccoughed, and slapped his mouth lightly after doing so.","“Who knows? Quite a lot have died since then,” said the steward, and with that he hiccuped, covering his mouth slightly with his hand, as with a little screen.","“Why, how do you mean, how many? There’s been many dying off since then,” said the steward and hiccuped at the same time, shielding his mouth by slightly cupping his hand over it."

"Они подъехали к дому. Хозяина не было; встретила их жена, родная сестра Платонова, белокурая, белоликая, с прямо русским выраженьем, так же красавица, но так же полусонная, как он. Кажется, как будто ее мало заботило то, о чем заботятся, или оттого, что всепоглощающая деятельность мужа ничего не оставила на ее долю, или оттого, что ока принадлежала, по самому сложению своему, к тому философическому разряду людей, которые, имея и чувства, и мысли, и ум, живут как-то вполовину, на жизнь глядят вполглаза и, видя возмутительные тревоги и борьбы, говорят: «Пусть их, дураки, бесятся! Им же хуже».","They drove up to the house.

"И в самом деле, Селифан давно уже ехал зажмуря глаза, изредка только потряхивая впросонках вожжами по бокам дремавших тоже лошадей; а с Петрушки уже давно невесть в каком месте слетел картуз, и он сам, опрокинувшись назад, уткнул свою голову в колено Чичикову, так что тот должен был дать ей щелчка. Селифан приободрился и, отшлепавши несколько раз по спине чубарого, после чего тот пустился рысцой, да помахнувши сверху кнутом на всех, примолвил тонким певучим голоском: «Не бойся!» Лошадки расшевелились и понесли, как пух, легонькую бричку. Селифан только помахивал да покрикивал: «Эх! эх! эх!» — плавно подскакивая на козлах, по мере того как тройка то взлетала на пригорок, то неслась духом с пригорка, которыми была усеяна вся столбовая дорога, стремившаяся чуть заметным накатом вниз. Чичиков только улыбался, слегка подлетывая на своей кожаной подушке, ибо любил быструю езду. И какой же русский не любит быстрой езды? Его ли душе, стремящейся закружиться, загуляться, сказать иногда: «черт побери все!» — его ли душе не любить ее? Ее ли не любить, когда в ней слышится что-то восторженно-чудное? Кажись, неведомая сила подхватила тебя на крыло к себе, и сам летишь, и все летит: летят версты, летят навстречу купцы на облучках своих кибиток, летит с обеих сторон лес с темными строями елей и сосен, с топорным стуком и вороньим криком, летит вся дорога невесть куда в пропадающую даль, и что-то страшное заключено в сем быстром мельканье, где не успевает означиться пропадающий предмет, — только небо над головою, да легкие тучи, да продирающийся месяц одни кажутся недвижны. Эх, тройка! птица тройка, кто тебя выдумал? знать, у бойкого народа ты могла только родиться, в той земле, что не любит шутить, а ровнем-гладнем разметнулась на полсвета, да и ступай считать версты, пока не зарябит тебе в очи. И не хитрый, кажись, дорожный снаряд, не железным схвачен винтом, а наскоро живьем с одним топором да молотом снарядил и собрал тебя ярославский расторопный мужик. Не в немецких ботфортах ямщик: борода да рукавицы, и сидит черт знает на чем; а привстал, да замахнулся, да затянул песню — кони вихрем, спицы в колесах смешались в один гладкий круг, только дрогнула дорога, да вскрикнул в испуге остановившийся пешеход — и вон она понеслась, понеслась, понеслась!.. И вон уже видно вдали, как что-то пылит и сверлит воздух.","And in fact, Selifan had long been riding with his eyes shut, occasionally only waking up shaking the reins on the sides of the horses, which were also dozing; and Petrushka's cap had long since fallen off in some place, and he himself, tipping over backwards, buried his head in Chichikov's knee, so that he had to give it a click. Selifan cheered up and, slapping the dapple-haired man several times on the back, after which he set off at a trot, and waving his whip at everyone from above, said in a thin, melodious voice: “Do not be afraid!” The horses stirred and carried, like fluff, a light britzka. Selifan only waved and shouted: “Eh! eh! eh!"" - smoothly jumping on the goats, as the troika either took off up the hillock, then rushed in spirit from the hillock, with which the entire high road was dotted, striving with a slightly noticeable roll down. Chichikov only smiled, slightly flying up on his leather cushion, for he liked fast driving. And what Russian does not like to drive fast? Is it his soul, seeking to spin, take a walk, sometimes say: “Damn it all!” Is it possible for his soul not to love her? Is it not to love her when something enthusiastic and wonderful is heard in her? It seems that an unknown force has taken you on a wing to itself, and you yourself are flying, and everything is flying: versts are flying, merchants are flying towards them on the wings of their wagons, a forest is flying on both sides with dark formations of firs and pines, with a clumsy knock and a crow's cry, flying the whole road, God knows where, into the vanishing distance, and something terrible is contained in this rapid flickering, where the vanishing object does not have time to appear - only the sky above the head, and the light clouds, and the moon trudging through, alone seem to be motionless. Ah, the trio! bird troika, who invented you? to know that you could only be born among a lively people, in that land that does not like to joke, but spread out half the world as evenly as possible, and go and count miles until it fills your eyes. And not a cunning, it would seem, road projectile, not captured by an iron screw, but hastily, alive with one ax and a hammer, a smart Yaroslavl peasant equipped and assembled you. The coachman is not in German boots: a beard and mittens, and the devil knows what he sits on; but he got up, and swung, and began to sing a song - the horses whirlwind, the spokes in the wheels mixed up in one smooth circle, only the road trembled, and the pedestrian who stopped screamed in fright - and there she rushed, rushed, rushed! .. And you can already see in the distance, as something dusts and drills the air.","And, indeed, Selifan had for a long time been driving with closed eyes, only occasionally shaking the reins about the sides of the horses who were also dozing; and Petrushka’s cap had fallen off long ago, and he had sunk back with his head poking Tchitchikov ’s legs so that the latter was obliged to give him a nudge. Selifan pulled himself together, and giving the dappled grey a few switches on the back, after which the latter fell into a trot, and flourishing the whip over them all, cried in a thin sing-song voice: “Never fear.” The horses bestirred themselves and carried the chaise along as though it were as light as a feather. Selifan brandished the whip and kept shouting, “Ech! ech! ech!” smoothly rising up and down on the box, as the three horses darted up or flew like the wind down the little hills which dotted the high road that sloped scarcely perceptibly down hill. Tchitchikov merely smiled as he lightly swayed on his leather cushion, for he loved rapid driving. And what Russian does not love rapid driving? How should his soul that craves to be lost in a whirl, to carouse without stint, to say at times , “Damnation take it all!”—how should his soul not love it? How not love it when there is a feeling in it of something ecstatic and marvellous? One fancies an unseen force has caught one up on its wing and one flies oneself, and everything flies too: milestones fly by, merchants on the front seats of their tilt-carts fly to meet one , the forest flies by on both sides with dark rows of firs and pines, with the ring of the axe and caw of the crows; the whole road flies into the unknown retreating distance; and there is something terrible in this rapid flitting by, in which there is no time to distinguish the vanishing object and only the sky over one’s head and the light clouds and the moon that struggles through them seem motionless. Ah! troika,dx bird of a troika! Who was it first thought of thee? Sure, thou couldst only have been born among a spirited people,—in that land that does not care to do things by halves, but has spread, a vast plain, over half the world, and one may count its milestones till one’s eyes are dizzy! And there is nothing elaborate, one would think, about thy construction; it is not held together by iron screws— no, a deft Yaroslavdy peasant fitted thee up and put thee together, hastily, roughly, with nothing but axe and drill. The driver wears no German top boots: he has a beard and gauntlets, and sits upon goodness knows what; but when he stands up and swings his whip and sets up a song—the horses fly like a whirlwind, the spokes of the wheels are blended into one revolving disc, the road quivers, and the pedestrian cries out, halting in alarm—and the troika dashes away and away! ... And already all that can be seen in the distance is something flinging up the dust and whirling through the air.","And indeed, Selifan had long been sitting with half-closed eyes, and hands which bestowed no encouragement upon his somnolent steeds save an occasional flicking of the reins against their flanks; whilst Petrushka had lost his cap, and was leaning backwards until his head had come to rest against Chichikov’s knees—a position which necessitated his being awakened with a cuff. Selifan also roused himself, and apportioned to the skewbald a few cuts across the back of a kind which at least had the effect of inciting that animal to trot; and when, presently, the other two horses followed their companion’s example, the light britchka moved forwards like a piece of thistledown. Selifan flourished his whip and shouted, “Hi, hi!” as the inequalities of the road jerked him vertically on his seat; and meanwhile, reclining against the leather cushions of the vehicle’s interior, Chichikov smiled with gratification at the sensation of driving fast. For what Russian does not love to drive fast? Which of us does not at times yearn to give his horses their head, and to let them go, and to cry, “To the devil with the world!”? At such moments a great force seems to uplift one as on wings; and one flies, and everything else flies, but contrariwise—both the verst stones, and traders riding on the shafts of their waggons, and the forest with dark lines of spruce and fir amid which may be heard the axe of the woodcutter and the croaking of the raven. Yes, out of a dim, remote distance the road comes towards one, and while nothing save the sky and the light clouds through which the moon is cleaving her way seem halted, the brief glimpses wherein one can discern nothing clearly have in them a pervading touch of mystery. Ah, troika, troika, swift as a bird, who was it first invented you? Only among a hardy race of folk can you have come to birth—only in a land which, though poor and rough, lies spread over half the world, and spans versts the counting whereof would leave one with aching eyes. Nor are you a modishly-fashioned vehicle of the road—a thing of clamps and iron. Rather, you are a vehicle but shapen and fitted with the axe or chisel of some handy peasant of Yaroslav. Nor are you driven by a coachman clothed in German livery, but by a man bearded and mittened. See him as he mounts, and flourishes his whip, and breaks into a long-drawn song! Away like the wind go the horses, and the wheels, with their spokes, become transparent circles, and the road seems to quiver beneath them, and a pedestrian, with a cry of astonishment, halts to watch the vehicle as it flies, flies, flies on its way until it becomes lost on the ultimate horizon—a speck amid a cloud of dust!","And indeed Selifan had long been driving with his eyes closed, only occasionally, through sleep, snapping the reins against the flanks of the horses, who were also dozing; and Petrushka’s cap had long since flown off at some unknown place, and he himself was leaning back, resting his head on Chichikov’s knee, so that he had to give it a flick. Selifan perked up and, slapping the dapple-gray on the back a few times, which made him break into a trot, and brandishing his whip over them all, added in a thin, singsong voice: “Never fear!” The horses got moving and pulled the light britzka along like a bit of fluff. Selifan just kept brandishing and shouting “Hup! hup! hup!” bouncing smoothly on his box, as the troika now flew up and now rushed full-tilt down a hummock, such as were scattered the whole length of the high road, which ran down a barely noticeable slope. Chichikov just smiled, jouncing slightly on his leather cushion, for he loved fast driving. And what Russian does not love fast driving? How can his soul, which yearns to get into a whirl, to carouse, to say sometimes: “Devil take it all!”—how can his soul not love it? Not love it when something ecstatically wondrous is felt in it? It seems an unknown force has taken you on its wing, and you are flying, and everything is flying: milestones go flying by, merchants come flying at you on the boxes of their kibitkas, the forest on both sides is flying by with its dark ranks of firs and pines, with axes chopping and crows cawing, the whole road is flying off no one knows where into the vanishing distance, and there is something terrible in this quick flashing, in which the vanishing object has no time to fix itself—only the sky overhead, and the light clouds, and the moon trying to break through, they alone seem motionless. Ah, troika! bird troika, who invented you? Surely you could only have been born among a brisk people, in a land that cares not for jokes, but sweeps smoothly and evenly over half the world, and you can go on counting the miles until it all dances before your eyes. And you are no clever traveling outfit, it seems, held together by an iron screw, but some dextrous Yaroslav muzhik fitted you out and put you together slapdash, with only an axe and a chisel. The driver wears no German top boots: a beard, mittens, and devil knows what he sits on; but when he stands up, waves, and strikes up a song—the steeds go like the wind, the spokes of the wheels blend to a smooth disc, the road simply shudders, and the passerby stops and cries out in fright —there she goes racing, racing, racing! … And already far in the distance you see something raising dust and drilling the air.","And really Selifan had long been driving along with his eyes closed and half asleep, merely flipping the reins at rare intervals over the flanks of the horses, who were also dozing; as for Petrushka, his cap had long since flown off, no one could tell where, and he himself, having slumped back, had propped his head against Chichikov’s knee, so that the latter had to give it a rap to make him sit up. Selifan bucked up a little and, having clipped the back of the piebald several times, whereupon that horse set off at a dogtrot, and having flourished the whip over all of them, uttered in a high, singsong voice: “Don’t you be scairt!” The nags bestirred themselves and dashed along with the light little carriage as if it were so much swansdown. Selifan merely kept brandishing his whip and adding the shouted encouragement of “Eh! Eh! Eh!” as he smoothly rose and fell on his box, depending on whether the troika was flying up a hillock or dashing with all its might down a hillock, with which hillocks the entire highroad was strewn, although it stretched away downhill in a barely perceptible slope. Chichikov merely kept smiling, jouncing a little on his leather cushion, for he loved fast driving. And what Russian is there who doesn’t love fast driving? How should his soul, which yearns to go off into a whirl, to go off on a fling, to say on occasion: “Devil take it all!”—how should his soul fail to love it? Is it not a thing to be loved, when one can sense in it something exaltedly wondrous? Some unseen power, it seems, has caught you up on its wing, and you’re flying yourself, and all things else are flying: the milestones are flying, some merchants are flying toward you, perched on the front seats of their covered carts; the forest flies on both sides of the road with its dark rows of firs and pines, echoing with the ring of axes and the cawing of crows; the whole road is flying none knows whither into the disappearing distance; and there is something fearsome hidden in the very flashing by of objects, so rapid that there’s no time for each one to become defined before it disappears; only the sky in the infinity above and the light clouds and the moon breaking through these clouds seem motionless. Eh, thou troika, thou that art a bird! Who conceived thee? Methinks’tis only among a spirited folk that thou couldst have come into being, in that land that is not fond of doing things by halves, but that has evenly, smoothly spread itself out over half the world; therefore, try and count its milestones until they turn to spots before the eyes! And far from cunningly contrived is the vehicle the troika draws; held together with no screws of iron art thou, but hastily, with a slam and a bang, wert thou put together and fitted out by some handy muzhik of Iaroslavl, with nothing but an ax and a chisel. No fancy Hessian jackboots does thy driver wear, he sports a beard and great gauntlets and sits on the Devil knows what for a cushion, but let him rise in his seat, and swing his whip back, and strike up a long-drawn song—and his steeds are off like a whirlwind, the spokes of each wheel have blended into one unbroken disk; the road merely quivers, and a passerby on foot, stopping short, cries out in fright, and the troika is soaring, soaring, soaring away! . .. And now all one can see, already far in the distance, is something raising the dust and swirling through the air."
"Еще падет обвинение на автора со стороны так называемых патриотов, которые спокойно сидят себе по углам и занимаются совершенно посторонними делами, накопляют себе капитальцы, устроивая судьбу свою на счет других; но как только случится что-нибудь, по мненью их, оскорбительное для отечества, появится какая-нибудь книга, в которой скажется иногда горькая правда, они выбегут со всех углов, как пауки, увидевшие, что запуталась в паутину муха, и подымут вдруг клики: «Да хорошо ли выводить это на свет, провозглашать об этом? Ведь это все, что ни описано здесь, это все наше — хорошо ли это? А что скажут иностранцы? Разве весело слышать дурное мнение о себе. Думают, разве это не больно? Думают, разве мы не патриоты?» Да такие мудрые замечания, особенно насчет мнения иностранцев, признаюсь, ничего нельзя прибрать в ответ. А разве вот что: жили в одном отдаленном уголке России два обитателя. Один был отец семейства, по имени Кифа Мокиевич, человек нрава кроткого, проводивший жизнь халатным образом. Семейством своим он не занимался; существованье его было обращено более в умозрительную сторону и занято следующим, как он называл, философическим вопросом: «Вот, например, зверь, — говорил он, ходя по комнате, — зверь родится нагишом. Почему же именно нагишом? Почему не так, как птица, почему не вылупливается из яйца? Как, право, того: совсем не поймешь натуры, как побольше в нее углубишься!» Так мыслил обитатель Кифа Мокиевич. Но не в этом еще главное дело. Другой обитатель был Мокий Кифович, родной сын его. Был он то, что называют на Руси богатырь, и в то время, когда отец занимался рожденьем зверя, двадцатилетняя плечистая натура его так и порывалась развернуться. Ни за что не умел он взяться слегка: все или рука у кого-нибудь затрещит, или волдырь вскочит на чьем-нибудь носу. В доме и в соседстве все, от дворовой девки до дворовой собаки, бежало прочь, его завидя; даже собственную кровать в спальне изломал он в куски. Таков был Мокий Кифович, а впрочем, был он доброй души. Но не в этом еще главное дело. А главное дело вот в чем: «Помилуй, батюшка барин, Кифа Мокиевич, — говорила отцу и своя и чужая дворня, — что у тебя за Мокий Кифович? Никому нет от него покоя, такой припертень!» — «Да, шаловлив, шаловлив, — говорил обыкновенно на это отец, — да ведь как быть: драться с ним поздно, да и меня же все обвинят в жестокости; а человек он честолюбивый, укори его при другом-третьем, он уймется, да ведь гласность-то — вот беда! город узнает, назовет его совсем собакой. Что, право, думают, мне разве не больно? разве я не отец? Что занимаюсь философией да иной раз нет времени, так уж я и не отец? Ан вот нет же, отец! отец, черт их побери, отец! У меня Мокий Кифович вот тут сидит, в сердце! — Тут Кифа Мокиевич бил себя весьма сильно в грудь кулаком и приходил в совершенный азарт. — Уж если он и останется собакой, так пусть же не от меня об этом узнают, пусть не я выдал его». И, показав такое отеческое чувство, он оставлял Мокия Кифовича продолжать богатырские свои подвиги, а сам обращался вновь к любимому предмету, задав себе вдруг какой-нибудь подобный вопрос: «Ну а если бы слон родился в яйце, ведь скорлупа, чай, сильно бы толста была, пушкой не прошибешь; нужно какое-нибудь новое огнестрельное орудие выдумать». Так проводили жизнь два обитателя мирного уголка, которые нежданно, как из окошка, выглянули в конце нашей поэмы, выглянули для того, чтобы отвечать скромно на обвинение со стороны некоторых горячих патриотов, до времени покойно занимающихся какой-нибудь философией или приращениями на счет сумм нежно любимого ими отечества, думающих не о том, чтобы не делать дурного, а о том, чтобы только не говорили, что они делают дурное. Но нет, не патриотизм и не первое чувство суть причины обвинений, другое скрывается под ними. К чему таить слово? Кто же, как не автор, должен сказать святую правду? Вы боитесь глубоко устремленного взора, вы страшитесь сами устремить на что-нибудь глубокий взор, вы любите скользнуть по всему недумающими глазами. Вы посмеетесь даже от души над Чичиковым, может быть, даже похвалите автора, скажете: «Однако ж кое-что он ловко подметил, должен быть веселого нрава человек!» И после таких слов с удвоившеюся гордостию обратитесь к себе, самодовольная улыбка покажется на лице вашем, и вы прибавите: «А ведь должно согласиться, престранные и пресмешные бывают люди в некоторых провинциях, да и подлецы притом немалые!» А кто из вас, полный христианского смиренья, не гласно, а в тишине, один, в минуты уединенных бесед с самим собой, углубит вовнутрь собственной души сей тяжелый запрос: «А нет ли и во мне какой-нибудь части Чичикова?» Да, как бы не так! А вот пройди в это время мимо его какой-нибудь его же знакомый, имеющий чин ни слишком большой, ни слишком малый, он в ту же минуту толкнет под руку своего соседа и скажет ему, чуть не фыркнув от смеха: «Смотри, смотри, вон Чичиков, Чичиков пошел!» И потом, как ребенок, позабыв всякое приличие, должное званию и летам, побежит за ним вдогонку, поддразнивая сзади и приговаривая: «Чичиков! Чичиков! Чичиков!»","The author will still be accused by the so-called patriots, who sit quietly in their corners and are engaged in completely extraneous affairs, accumulate capital for themselves, arranging their fate at the expense of others; but as soon as something happens, in their opinion, insulting to the fatherland, some book appears, in which sometimes the bitter truth is revealed, they will run out from all corners, like spiders who see that a fly is entangled in a web, and suddenly raise cliques : “Is it good to bring it to light, to proclaim it? After all, this is all that is not described here, this is all ours - is it good? What will foreigners say? Is it fun to hear a bad opinion about yourself. Think it doesn't hurt? Do they think we are not patriots?” Yes, such wise remarks, especially about the opinion of foreigners, I confess, nothing can be cleaned up in response. But perhaps this: two inhabitants lived in one remote corner of Russia. One was the father of the family, named Kifa Mokievich, a man of meek disposition, who spent his life in a negligent manner. He did not take care of his family; his existence was turned more speculatively and occupied with the following, as he called it, philosophical question: “Here, for example, the beast,” he said, walking around the room, “the beast will be born naked. Why exactly naked? Why not like a bird, why doesn't it hatch from an egg? How, really, that: you won’t understand nature at all, as you go deeper into it! This is how the inhabitant of Kifa Mokievich thought. But this is not the main point. Another inhabitant was Mokiy Kifovich, his own son. He was what they call in Russia a hero, and at the time when his father was engaged in the birth of the beast, his twenty-year-old broad-shouldered nature was trying to turn around. He never knew how to lightly grasp anything: either someone's hand cracks, or a blister pops up on someone's nose. Everyone in the house and in the neighborhood, from the yard girl to the yard dog, ran away when they saw him; he even broke his own bed in the bedroom into pieces. Such was Mokiy Kifovich, and by the way, he was a good soul. But this is not the main point. And the main thing is this: “Have mercy, father, gentleman, Kifa Mokievich,” both his own and other household servants said to his father, “what kind of Mokiy Kifovich do you have? No one has peace from him, such a corner!” “Yes, playful, playful,” my father usually said to this, “but what can I do: it’s too late to fight him, and everyone will accuse me of cruelty; but he is an ambitious man, reproach him with a friend or a third, he will calm down, but after all, publicity is the trouble! the city will know, call him a complete dog. What, really, they think, doesn't it hurt me? am I not a father? That I do philosophy and sometimes I don’t have time, so I’m not a father? But no, father! father, damn them, father! I have Moky Kifovich sitting right here, in my heart! - Here Kifa Mokievich beat himself very hard on the chest with his fist and went into complete excitement. “If he remains a dog, then let them not find out about it from me, let it not be me who betrayed him.” And, having shown such a paternal feeling, he left Mokiy Kifovich to continue his heroic deeds, and he turned again to his favorite subject, suddenly asking himself some similar question: “Well, if an elephant was born in an egg, after all, the shell, tea, would be very strong. she was fat, you can’t break through with a cannon; you need to invent some new firearms."" This is how two inhabitants of a peaceful corner spent their lives, who suddenly, as if from a window, looked out at the end of our poem, looked out in order to modestly answer the accusation from some ardent patriots, until the time calmly engaged in some kind of philosophy or increments at the expense of sums gently their beloved fatherland, thinking not about not doing bad things, but about not saying that they are doing bad things. But no, not patriotism and not the first feeling are the reasons for the accusations, something else is hidden under them. Why hide a word? Who, if not the author, should tell the holy truth? You are afraid of a deeply fixed gaze, you yourself are afraid of directing a deep gaze at something, you love to glimpse everything with unthinking eyes. You will even laugh heartily at Chichikov, maybe even praise the author, say: “However, he cleverly noticed something, a person must be of a cheerful disposition!” And after such words, with redoubled pride, turn to yourself, a self-satisfied smile will appear on your face, and you will add: “But you must agree, people in some provinces are strange and ridiculous, and scoundrels, moreover, no small!” And which of you, full of Christian humility, not publicly, but in silence, alone, in moments of solitary conversations with himself, will deepen this heavy inquiry into his own soul: “Isn’t there some part of Chichikov in me too?” Yes, no matter how! But if at that time some acquaintance of his, who has a rank neither too high nor too small, passes by at that moment, he will immediately push his neighbor by the arm and say to him, almost snorting with laughter: “Look, look, get out Chichikov, Chichikov has gone!” And then, like a child, forgetting all propriety due to his rank and years, he will run after him, teasing him from behind and saying: “Chichikov! Chichikov! Chichikov!","The author will incur censure also from the so-called patriots who as a rule sit quietly at home and busy themselves about quite other matters, making money, making their fortunes at the expense of others; but as soon as anything happens which they regard as insulting to their country, if a book appears in which some bitter truth is told, they run out of every corner like spiders, when they see a fly caught in their web, and immediately raise outcries: “Is it right to bring such a thing to light, to proclaim it aloud? Why, all the things that are described here are our private affairs—is it right? What will foreigners say? Is it pleasant to hear a low opinion of oneself? Do they imagine that it isn’t painful? Do they imagine that we are not patriots?” I must confess that I cannot find a fitting answer to these sage observations, especially the one concerning the opinion of foreigners. Unless perhaps this. Two citizens lived in a remote corner of Russia. One whose name was Kifa Mokievitch was the father of a family, and a man of mild disposition, who passed his life in a dressing-gown and slippers; he did not trouble his head about his family; his time was devoted rather to speculative inquiries and engrossed with the following philosophical—as he called it—questions: “Now for instance the animal is born naked,” he would say as he walked up and down the room. “Why is it that he is naked? Why isn’t he born like a bird: why isn’t he hatched out of an egg? It really is ... er ... The more you look into nature the harder it is to understand! ... ” Such were the meditations of the worthy citizen Kifa Mokievitch. But that is not what matters. The other citizen was Moky Kifovitch, his son. He was what is called in Russia a bogatyr, dw and while his father was absorbed in the question of the problem of the birth of animals, this muscular young man of twenty craved for self-expression. He could not do anything by halves: somebody’s arm was always broken or somebody else had a bump on his nose. Every one in the house or the neighbourhood—from the serf girl to the yard dog—fled at the sight of him: he even smashed his own bedstead into fragments. Such was Moky Kifovitch, but yet he had a kind heart. But that is not the point either. The point really is this: “Mercy on us, kind sir, Kifa Mokievitch,” said all the servants of his own and the neighbouring households to his father, “your Moky Kifovitch is too much for us. Nobody has any peace for him, he is such a pestering fellow!” “Yes, he is mischievous, he is mischievous,” his father usually replied: “but there, what’s to be done? It’s too late to knock him about, besides every one would blame me for cruelty; and he is sensitive; reproach him before two or three other people, he’ll be meek, but then the publicity! That is what is so dreadful! All the town would be calling him a cur. Do you really imagine that would not be painful—am I not his father? Because I am absorbed in philosophy and have not time to attend to my family, do you suppose I am not a father? No, indeed, I am his father! his father, hang it all, his father. Moky Kifovitch is very near and dear to me! “ At this point Kifa Mokievitch smote himself on the chest with his fist and became greatly excited. ” If he is to remain a cur, don’t let people learn it from me, don’t let me give him away!“ And having thus displayed his paternal sentiments, he left Moky Kifovitch to persevere in his heroic exploits and returned again to his favourite subject, asking himself some such question as: ”Well, if an elephant were hatched out of an egg I expect the shell would be pretty thick, you wouldn’t break it with a cannon ball, they would have to invent some new explosive. “ So thus they went on living, these two citizens who have so unexpectedly peeped out of their quiet retirement as out of a window into the end of our poem, in order to furnish a modest answer to the censures of some ardent patriots who have hitherto been quietly engaged in philosophical pursuits or in increasing their fortunes at the expense of the finances of the country they love so dearly, not caring about avoiding wrongdoing, but very anxious that people should not talk of their wrong-doings. But no, not patriotism, nor genuine feeling is at the root of their censure. Another feeling lies concealed under it. Why hide the truth? Who if not an author is bound to speak the holy truth? You are afraid of any one’s looking deeply below the surface, you dread looking below the surface yourselves, you like to glide over everything with heedless eyes. You even laugh heartily at Tchitchikov, perhaps you will even praise the author—and will say: ”He has neatly hit it off, though, he must be an amusing fellow! “ And after saying that you look at yourself with redoubled pride, a self-satisfied smile comes on to your face and you add: ”There is no denying that there are very queer and funny people in some provinces and thorough rogues too! “ And which of you, full of Christian meekness, not in public, but alone in private, at the moment of solitary inward converse, asks in the depths of your own soul, this painful question: ”Is there not a bit of Tchitchikov in me too? “ And it is pretty sure to be so indeed! And if some friend, not of too low or too high a grade in the service, should chance to pass by at that moment, you will immediately nudge your neighbour and will say almost guffawing: ” Look, look, there goes Tchitchikov, there’s Tchitchikov! “ And then like a child, forgetting all decorum befitting your age and position, you will run behind him, mimicking and repeating: ”Tchitchikov! Tchitchikov! Tchitchikov!“","Possibly the author may also incur censure at the hands of those so-called “patriots” who sit quietly in corners, and become capitalists through making fortunes at the expense of others. Yes, let but something which they conceive to be derogatory to their country occur—for instance, let there be published some book which voices the bitter truth— and out they will come from their hiding-places like a spider which perceives a fly to be caught in its web. “Is it well to proclaim this to the world, and to set folk talking about it?” they will cry. “What you have described touches US, is OUR affair. Is conduct of that kind right? What will foreigners say? Does any one care calmly to sit by and hear himself traduced? Why should you lead foreigners to suppose that all is not well with us, and that we are not patriotic?” Well, to these sage remarks no answer can really be returned, especially to such of the above as refer to foreign opinion. But see here. There once lived in a remote corner of Russia two natives of the region indicated. One of those natives was a good man named Kifa Mokievitch, and a man of kindly disposition; a man who went through life in a dressing-gown, and paid no heed to his household, for the reason that his whole being was centred upon the province of speculation, and that, in particular, he was preoccupied with a philosophical problem usually stated by him thus: “A beast,” he would say, “is born naked. Now, why should that be? Why should not a beast be born as a bird is born—that is to say, through the process of being hatched from an egg? Nature is beyond the understanding, however much one may probe her.” This was the substance of Kifa Mokievitch’s reflections. But herein is not the chief point. The other of the pair was a fellow named Mofi Kifovitch, and son to the first named. He was what we Russians call a “hero,” and while his father was pondering the parturition of beasts, his, the son’s, lusty, twenty-year-old temperament was violently struggling for development. Yet that son could tackle nothing without some accident occurring. At one moment would he crack some one’s fingers in half, and at another would he raise a bump on somebody’s nose; so that both at home and abroad every one and everything—from the serving-maid to the yard-dog—fled on his approach, and even the bed in his bedroom became shattered to splinters. Such was Mofi Kifovitch; and with it all he had a kindly soul. But herein is not the chief point. “Good sir, good Kifa Mokievitch,” servants and neighbours would come and say to the father, “what are you going to do about your Moki Kifovitch? We get no rest from him, he is so above himself.” “That is only his play, that is only his play,” the father would reply. “What else can you expect? It is too late now to start a quarrel with him, and, moreover, every one would accuse me of harshness. True, he is a little conceited; but, were I to reprove him in public, the whole thing would become common talk, and folk would begin giving him a dog’s name. And if they did that, would not their opinion touch me also, seeing that I am his father? Also, I am busy with philosophy, and have no time for such things. Lastly, Moki Kifovitch is my son, and very dear to my heart.” And, beating his breast, Kifa Mokievitch again asserted that, even though his son should elect to continue his pranks, it would not be for HIM, for the father, to proclaim the fact, or to fall out with his offspring. And, this expression of paternal feeling uttered, Kifa Mokievitch left Moki Kifovitch to his heroic exploits, and himself returned to his beloved subject of speculation, which now included also the problem, “Suppose elephants were to take to being hatched from eggs, would not the shell of such eggs be of a thickness proof against cannonballs, and necessitate the invention of some new type of firearm?” Thus at the end of this little story we have these two denizens of a peaceful corner of Russia looking thence, as from a window, in less terror of doing what was scandalous than of having it SAID of them that they were acting scandalously. Yes, the feeling animating our so-called “patriots” is not true patriotism at all. Something else lies beneath it. Who, if not an author, is to speak aloud the truth? Men like you, my pseudo-patriots, stand in dread of the eye which is able to discern, yet shrink from using your own, and prefer, rather, to glance at everything unheedingly. Yes, after laughing heartily over Chichikov’s misadventures, and perhaps even commending the author for his dexterity of observation and pretty turn of wit , you will look at yourselves with redoubled pride and a self-satisfied smile, and add: “Well, we agree that in certain parts of the provinces there exists strange and ridiculous individuals, as well as unconscionable rascals.” Yet which of you, when quiet, and alone, and engaged in solitary self-communion, would not do well to probe YOUR OWN souls, and to put to YOURSELVES the solemn question, “Is there not in ME an element of Chichikov?” For how should there not be? Which of you is not liable at any moment to be passed in the street by an acquaintance who, nudging his neighbour, may say of you, with a barely suppressed sneer: “Look! there goes Chichikov! That is Chichikov who has just gone by!”","Accusation will also fall upon the author from the side of the so-called patriots, who sit quietly in their corners, occupied with completely unrelated matters, and stash away small fortunes for themselves, arranging their lives at the expense of others; but as soon as something happens which in their opinion is insulting to the fatherland, if some book appears in which the sometimes bitter truth is told, they rush out of all corners like spiders seeing a fly tangled in their web, and suddenly raise a cry: “But is it good to bring it to light, to proclaim about it? Because all this that’s written here, all this is ours—is that nice? And what will foreigners say? Is it cheery to hear a bad opinion of oneself? Do they think it doesn’t hurt? Do they think we’re not patriots?” To these wise observations, especially concerning the opinion of foreigners, I confess it is impossible to find an answer. Unless it is this: in a remote corner of Russia there lived two inhabitants. One was a father of a family, Kifa Mokievich by name, a man of meek character who spent his life in a dressing-gown way. He did not occupy himself with his family; his existence was turned more in a contemplative direction and was occupied with the following, as he called it , philosophical question: “Take, for instance, a beast,” he would say, pacing the room, “a beast is born naked. And why precisely naked? Why not like a bird , why not hatched from an egg? So you see: the deeper you go into nature, the less you understand her!” Thus reasoned the inhabitant Kifa Mokievich. But that is still not the main thing. The other inhabitant was Moky Kifovich, his own son. He was what is known in Russia as a mighty man, and all the while that his father was occupied with the birth of a beast, his broad-shouldered twenty-year-old nature kept wanting to display itself. He could not go about anything lightly: it was always someone’s arm broken or a bump swelling on someone’s nose. In and around the house everything, from the serf wench to the yard bitch, ran away from him on sight; he even broke his own bed to pieces in the bedroom. Such was Moky Kifovich, who nevertheless had a good heart. But that is still not the main thing. The main thing is the following: “For pity’s sake, dear master, Kifa Mokievich,” his own and other house serfs used to say to the father, “what’s with your Moky Kifovich? He won’t leave anyone in peace, he’s such a roughneck.” “Yes, a prankster, a prankster,” the father usually replied to that, “but what can I do? It’s too late to beat him, and I’d be the one accused of cruelty; then, too, he’s a proud man, if I reproached him in front of just a couple of people, he’d calm down, but publicity—there’s the trouble! They’d find out in town and call him a downright dog. What do they think, really, that it doesn’t hurt me? that I’m not a father? That I occupy myself with philosophy and sometimes have no time, and so I’m not a father anymore? No, I’m a father all right! a father, devil take them, a father! I’ve got Moky Kifovich sitting right here in my heart!” Here Kifa Mokievich beat himself quite hard on the breast with his fist and flew into a complete passion. “Let him even remain a dog, but let them not find it out from me, let it not be me who betrays him.” Then, having shown such paternal feeling, he would leave Moky Kifovich to go on with his mighty deeds, and himself turn again to his favorite subject, suddenly asking himself some such question as: “Well, and if an elephant was born from an egg, then I suppose the shell would be mighty thick , a cannonball couldn’t break it; some new firearms would have to be invented.” So they spent their life, these two inhabitants of a peaceful corner, who have suddenly peeked out, as from a window, at the end of our poem, peeked out in order to respond modestly to accusations on the part of certain ardent patriots, who for the moment are quietly occupied with some sort of philosophy or with augmentations at the expense of their dearly beloved fatherland, and think not about not doing wrong, but only about having no one say they are doing wrong. But no, neither patriotism nor primal feeling is the cause of these accusations, something else is hidden behind them. Why conceal the word? Who, then, if not an author, must speak the sacred truth? You fear the deeply penetrating gaze, you are afraid to penetrate anything deeply with your own gaze, you like to skim over everything with unthinking eyes. You will even have a hearty laugh over Chichikov, will perhaps even praise the author, saying: “He did cleverly catch a thing or two, though; must be a man of merry temperament!” And after these words you will turn to yourself with redoubled pride, a self-satisfied smile will appear on your face, and you will add: “One can’t help agreeing, the most strange and ridiculous people turn up in some provinces, and no small scoundrels at that!” And who among you, filled with Christian humility, not publicly, but in quiet, alone, in moments of solitary converse with himself, will point deeply into his own soul this painful question: “And isn’t there a bit of Chichikov in me, too?” Perish the thought! But if some acquaintance of yours should pass by just then, a man of neither too high nor too low a rank, you will straightaway nudge your neighbor and tell him, all but snorting with laughter: “Look, look, there goes Chichikov, it’s Chichikov!” And then, like a child, forgetting all decorum incumbent upon your age and station, you will run after him, taunting him from behind and repeating: “Chichikov! Chichikov! Chichikov!”","The author will also incur censure on the part of the so-called patriots who take it easy in their snug nooks and busy themselves with utterly irrelevant matters, accumulating tidy little bank rolls and arranging their life at the expense of others; but, should anything at all happen which in their opinion is an insult to the fatherland, should some book or other appear in which some bitter truth occasionally emerges, they’ll come running out of all their crannies, like spiders on seeing a fly become tangled in a web, and will suddenly raise their voices to shout: “But is it a good thing to bring this out into the light, to proclaim this aloud? Why, everything that is described herein—everything!—has to do with our own affairs! Is it right to wash our linen in public? And what will the people abroad say? Is it so jolly to hear a bad opinion of our own selves? Do these people think this isn’t painful? Do they think we aren’t patriots?” To such sage observations, especially touching on the opinion of the people abroad, there is but little, I confess, to be scraped up by way of an answer. Except the following, perchance. Once upon a time there were two citizens living in a remote little nook of Russia. One was the father of a family, by the name of Kifa Mokievich, a man of a mild nature, who passed his life in an easygoing, dressing-gown-and-slippers sort of fashion. He didn’t bother himself with his family much: his existence was directed rather toward intellectual speculativeness and was taken up with the following philosophical, as he called it, problem. “You take an animal, for instance,” he’d say, pacing the room. “An animal is born stark naked. But why, precisely, stark naked? Why isn’t it born the way a bird is , why isn’t it hatched out of an egg? Really, now, when you consider it, there’s absolutely no understanding nature , the deeper one goes into it!” Thus did the citizen Kifa Mokievich cogitate. But that is not the main point. The other citizen was Mokii Kifovich, his own son. He was what is called in Russia a bogatyr, a man of might, and, at the same time that his father was preoccupied with how an animal is born, the son’s broad-shouldered, twenty-year-old nature was simply straining to unfold. He didn’t know how to handle anything lightly; always, if he clasped anyone’s hand, it would start cracking, or he’d raise a bump on somebody’s nose; in the house and in the neighborhood every living thing, from the house wench to the house dog, would run off yelping at the mere sight of him; he had even smashed the bed in his room all to pieces. Such was Mokii Kifovich; yet, taking him by and large, he was a good soul. But that’s still not the main point. The main point is this: “Have mercy, our father and our master, Kifa Mokievich,” he was appealed to both by his own domestics and by those of others, “what sort of a man is this Mokii Kifovich of yours? There’s never any rest for a body because of him, he’s such a confounded pest!” “Yes, he’s playful, he’s playful,” his father would usually say in answer to this, “ but then, what is one to do? It’s kind of late to take the strap to him, and besides I would be the one to be accused of cruelty by everybody. And yet he’s a sensitive sort of fellow: you upbraid him before two or three people and he’ll quiet down; but then there’s the notoriety, now, there’s the trouble! The whole town will find out and call him a downright dog. Really, now, what do people think, that it doesn’t pain me? Am I not a father? Just because I am taken up with philosophy, and once in a while have no time to bother with him, does that mean that I’m not a father? But, oh, no, never, I am a father! I am a father, the Devil take it, I am a father! I’ve got Mokii Kifovich enthroned right here, in my very heart!” At this point Kifa Mokievich would thump his fist on his chest quite hard and become downright aroused. “Well, if he’s bound to remain a dog, then don’t let people find it out from me, don’t let me be the one to give him away!” And, having evinced such a fatherly feeling, he would let Mokii Kifovich keep right on with his mighty exploits, while he him self turned anew to his favorite subject, suddenly posing some such question to himself as: “Well, now, suppose an elephant were to be born in a shell? Why, I guess the eggshell would be mighty thick, then; there would be no breaking it through even with a cannon; one would have to think up some new sort of ordnance.” Such was the mode of life in their peaceful nook of these two citizens of Russia who have so unexpectedly peeked, as if out of a little window, at the very end of our epic, who have peeked out in order to furnish a modest answer to censure on the part of certain ardent patriots, who up to now have been quietly busying themselves with some philosophy or with increments in the sums acquired at the expense of the fatherland they love so tenderly, who are not concerned about avoiding wrongdoing, but are only concerned lest people get to talking about their wrongdoing. But no, it is neither patriotism nor the desire to contemplate only the beautiful which is the true cause of their censures; there is something else lurking behind these apparent causes. Why keep one’s word secret? Who, if not an author, is bound to tell the sacred truth? You fear a penetratingly fixed gaze, you yourselves dread to fix your gaze penetratingly upon anything; you like to glide over everything with heedless eyes. You will even laugh with all your soul at this Chichikov, you may, perhaps, even praise the author, saying: “However, he has observed a thing or two quite deftly! He must be a merry sort of fellow!” And after saying this you’ll turn to yourselves with redoubled pride, a self-satisfied smile will appear upon your faces, and you’ll add: “ And yet one must agree, one does come across the queerest and most amusing people in certain provinces—and quite considerable scoundrels, to boot!” Yet which one of you, filled with Christian humility, not aloud, but in silence, when you are all alone, during moments of solitary communion with your own self, will let sink deep into the inward recesses of your own soul this onerous question: “Come, now, isn’t there a bit of Chichikov in me, too?” But there isn’t much likelihood of such a thing ever happening! And yet, if at this point someone or other were to pass by you, even actually a friend of yours, a fellow whose rank is neither too high nor too low, you would that very moment nudge the arm of the man next to you and say, all but snorting from laughter: “Look, look, there’s Chichikov, there goes Chichikov!” And then, like a child, having forgotten all the decorum befitting your calling and years, you’ll start running after him, teasing and calling him behind his back: “Yah, yah, yah! Chichikov! Chichikov! Chichikov!”"
"— Ах, что вы это говорите, Софья Ивановна! — сказала дама приятная во всех отношениях и всплеснула руками.","“Oh, what are you talking about, Sofya Ivanovna! said the lady agreeable in all respects, and clasped her hands.","“Oh, what are you saying, Sofya Ivanovna!” said the lady agreeable in all respects, and she clasped her hands.",“Yes; and I should say that one of those accomplices is Nozdrev.”,"“Ah, what are you saying, Sofya Ivanovna!” said the lady agreeable in all respects, clasping her hands.","“Ah, what are you saying, Sofia Ivanovna!” said the lady who was agreeable in all respects and wrung her hands."

Just feel them.”","“Lies, lies, you never even dreamed of combing him; I think, fool, that you even added some of your own.

Do but consider this well—why, you’re ruining yourself, paying a tax on a dead serf as if he were alive—”"
"— Нет, — подхватил Чичиков, — нет, я разумею предмет таков как есть, то есть те души, которые, точно, уже умерли.","""No,"" Chichikov put in, ""no, I mean the subject as it is, that is, those souls who, to be sure, have already died.""","“No,” Tchitchikov interposed. “ No, I mean just what I say, that is, the souls which are really dead.”","“Oh, no,” asserted Chichikov. “I mean what I say and no more.","“No,” Chichikov picked up, “no, I mean the subject just as it is, that is, those souls which, indeed, have already died.”","“No,” Chichikov caught him up, “no, I mean the matter to be taken just as it is—that is, I am referring to those souls who are now definitely dead.”"

Tell me, have any of your peasants been dying off?”"
"Покамест Чичиков думал и внутренно посмеивался над прозвищем, отпущенным мужиками Плюшкину, он не заметил, как въехал в средину обширного села со множеством изб и улиц. Скоро, однако же, дал заметить ему это препорядочный толчок, произведенный бревенчатою мостовою, пред которою городская каменная была ничто. Эти бревна, как фортепьянные клавиши, подымались то вверх, то вниз, и необерегшийся ездок приобретал или шишку на затылок, или синее пятно на лоб, или же случалось своими собственными зубами откусить пребольно хвостик собственного же языка. Какую-то особенную ветхость заметил он на всех деревенских строениях: бревно на избах было темно и старо; многие крыши сквозили, как решето; на иных оставался только конек вверху да жерди по сторонам в виде ребр. Кажется, сами хозяева снесли с них дранье и тес, рассуждая, и, конечно, справедливо, что в дождь избы не кроют, а в ведро и сама не каплет, бабиться же в ней незачем, когда есть простор и в кабаке, и на большой дороге, — словом, где хочешь. Окна в избенках были без стекол, иные были заткнуты тряпкой или зипуном; балкончики под крышами с перилами, неизвестно для каких причин делаемые в иных русских избах, покосились и почернели даже не живописно. Из-за изб тянулись во многих местах рядами огромные клади хлеба, застоявшиеся, как видно, долго; цветом походили они на старый, плохо выжженный кирпич, на верхушке их росла всякая дрянь, и даже прицепился сбоку кустарник. Хлеб, как видно, был господский. Из-за хлебных кладей и ветхих крыш возносились и мелькали на чистом воздухе, то справа, то слева, по мере того как бричка делала повороты, две сельские церкви, одна возле другой: опустевшая деревянная и каменная, с желтенькими стенами, испятнанная, истрескавшаяся. Частями стал выказываться господский дом и наконец глянул весь в том месте, где цепь изб прервалась и наместо их остался пустырем огород или капустник, обнесенный низкою, местами изломанною городьбою. Каким-то дряхлым инвалидом глядел сей странный замок, длинный, длинный непомерно. Местами был он в один этаж, местами в два; на темной крыше, не везде надежно защищавшей его старость, торчали два бельведера, один против другого, оба уже пошатнувшиеся, лишенные когда-то покрывавшей их краски. Стены дома ощеливали местами нагую штукатурную решетку и, как видно, много потерпели от всяких непогод, дождей, вихрей и осенних перемен. Из окон только два были открыты, прочие были заставлены ставнями или даже забиты досками. Эти два окна, с своей стороны, были тоже подслеповаты; на одном из них темнел наклеенный треугольник из синей сахарной бумаги.","While Chichikov was thinking and inwardly laughing at the nickname bestowed by the peasants on Plyushkin, he did not notice how he drove into the middle of a vast village with many huts and streets. Soon, however, he noticed this formidable jolt, produced by a log pavement, in front of which the city stone was nothing. These logs, like piano keys, rose up and down, and the careless rider acquired either a bump on the back of his head, or a blue spot on his forehead, or it happened with his own teeth to bite off painfully the tail of his own tongue. He noticed some special dilapidation on all the village buildings: the log on the huts was dark and old; many roofs blew through like a sieve; on others there was only a ridge at the top and poles on the sides in the form of ribs. It seems that the owners themselves took down the rags and the hemp from them, arguing, and, of course, it’s fair that they don’t cover the hut in the rain, and they don’t drip into the bucket themselves, but there’s no need to fumble in it when there is room both in the tavern and on the big road, in a word, wherever you want. The windows in the huts were without glass, others were plugged up with a rag or zipun; roofed balconies with railings, for unknown reasons, made in other Russian huts, squinted and turned black, not even picturesquely. Behind the huts in many places stretched in rows huge stacks of bread, which had evidently been stagnant for a long time; they looked like old, poorly baked bricks in color, all sorts of rubbish grew on their top, and even bushes clung to the side. The bread, apparently, was master's. From behind grain stores and dilapidated roofs, two village churches, one near the other, rose and flashed in the clear air, now to the right, then to the left, as the britzka made turns: an empty wooden one and a stone one, with yellowish walls, stained, cracked. Partially, the master's house began to show itself, and finally the whole thing looked in the place where the chain of huts was broken and instead of them there was a wasteland of a vegetable garden or a skit, surrounded by a low, in some places broken city. This strange castle looked like some kind of decrepit invalid, long, unreasonably long. In some places it was one story, in other places it was two; on the dark roof, which did not reliably protect his old age everywhere, two belvederes stuck out, one opposite the other, both already tottering, deprived of the paint that once covered them. The walls of the house slitted bare stucco grating in places and, apparently, suffered a lot from all sorts of bad weather, rains, whirlwinds and autumn changes. Of the windows, only two were open; the rest were shuttered or even boarded up. These two windows, for their part, were also half-sighted; one of them had a dark blue sugar paper triangle glued on.","While Tchitchikov was meditating and inwardly laughing at the nickname the peasant had given to Plyushkin, he did not notice that he had driven into the middle of a large village, with a number of peasant’s huts and streets. He was soon, however, roused to notice it by a rather violent jolting, as they passed over the bridge of logs, compared with which our town bridge of cobble-stones is nothing. The logs hop up and down like the keys of a piano, and the incautious traveller gets a bump on the back of his head, or a bruise on his forehead, or may chance to bite the tip of his tongue very painfully. He noticed signs of age and decay in all the village buildings; the logs of which the huts were built were old and dark. Many of the roofs were as full of holes as a sieve; on some nothing was left but the ridge-pole and the transverse pieces like ribs. It seemed as though the owners themselves had removed the laths and shingles, arguing, and no doubt quite correctly, that as huts cannot be roofed in the rain, while in fine weather the rain keeps off of itself, there is no need to mess about indoors, while there is plenty of room in the tavern and on the high-road-wherever one chooses, in fact. The windows in the huts had no panes, some were stuffed up with a rag or a coat. The little balconies with railings which for some inexplicable reason are put just below the roof in some Russian huts were all aslant and too black to be picturesque, even. In several places immense stacks of corn stretched in rows behind the huts, and evidently they had been standing there for years; in colour they were like an old, badly baked brick, all sorts of weeds were sprouting on the top of them, and bushes growing at the side were tangled in them. The corn was evidently the master’s. Behind the stacks of corn and dilapidated roofs two village churches, standing side by side, one wooden and disused, the other built of brick with yellow walls covered with stains and cracks, stood up in the pure air and showed in glimpses, first on the right and then on the left, as the chaise turned in one direction or another. Parts of the owner’s house came into sight, and at last the whole of it could be seen where there was a gap in the chain of huts, and there was the open space made by a kitchen garden or a cabbage patch, enclosed by a low, and in places broken, fence. This strange castle, which was of quite disproportionate length, had the air of a decrepit invalid. In parts it was of one storey, in parts of two; on its dark roof, which did not everywhere furnish it with secure protection, there stood two belvederes facing each other, both were infirm, and here and there bare of the paint that had once covered them. The walls of the house showed here and there the bare laths under the plaster and had evidently suffered a great deal from all sorts of weather, rain and hurricane, and the changes of autumn. Of the windows only two were uncovered, the others were closed with shutters or even boarded up. Even the two windows were half blind. On one of them was a triangular dark patch where a piece of the blue paper in which sugar is wrapped had been pasted.","outburst prevented him from noticing that he had reached the centre of a large and populous village; but, presently, a violent jolt aroused him to the fact that he was driving over wooden pavements of a kind compared with which the cobblestones of the town had been as nothing. Like the keys of a piano, the planks kept rising and falling, and unguarded passage over them entailed either a bump on the back of the neck or a bruise on the forehead or a bite on the tip of one’s tongue. At the same time Chichikov noticed a look of decay about the buildings of the village. The beams of the huts had grown dark with age, many of their roofs were riddled with holes, others had but a tile of the roof remaining, and yet others were reduced to the rib-like framework of the same. It would seem as though the inhabitants themselves had removed the laths and traverses, on the very natural plea that the huts were no protection against the rain, and therefore, since the latter entered in bucketfuls, there was no particular object to be gained by sitting in such huts when all the time there was the tavern and the highroad and other places to resort to.","While Chichikov thought and chuckled inwardly over the nickname the muzhiks had bestowed upon Plyushkin, he failed to notice that he had driven into the middle of a vast settlement with a multitude of cottages and lanes. Soon, however, it was brought to his notice by a quite decent jolt, produced by the log pavement, to which town cobblestones are nothing in comparison. These logs, like piano keys, kept rising up and down, and the unwary traveler would acquire a bump on his head, or a bruise on his brow, or might chance to give a painful bite with his own teeth to the tip of his own tongue. He noticed a sort of special dilapidation in all the village buildings: the logs of the cottages were dark and old; many of the roofs were riddled like sieves; some had just a ridge pole on top and rafters like ribs on the sides. It seemed as if the owners themselves had torn off the shingles and laths, considering—correctly, of course—that one does not roof cottages in the rain, and in fair weather there is no dripping anyway, so why sit around women’s skirts inside, when there is free space enough in the pot-house and on the high road—in short, anywhere you like. The windows of the cottages had no glass, some were stopped up with a rag or a jacket; the little roofed balconies with railings, which for unknown reasons are built onto some Russian cottages, were lopsided and blackened, not even picturesquely. Behind the cottages in many places stretched rows of huge stacks of wheat, which had evidently been standing there for a long time; in color they resembled old, poorly baked brick, trash of all kinds was growing on top of them, and bushes even clung to their sides. The wheat evidently belonged to the master. From behind the wheat stacks and dilapidated roofs there soared and flashed in the clear air, now right, now left, according to the turns the britzka made, two village churches, one next to the other: an abandoned wooden one, and a stone one, its yellowed walls all stains and cracks. Parts of the master’s house came into view and finally the whole of it appeared in a gap where the chain of cottages broke off and in their place was left a vacant lot, formerly a kitchen garden or cabbage patch, surrounded by a low, in places broken, fence. Long, immeasurably long, the strange castle looked like some decrepit invalid. In places it had one story, in places two; on the dark roof, which did not everywhere reliably shield its old age, two belvederes had been stuck, facing each other, both of them shaky now, deprived of the paint that had once covered them. The walls of the house showed bare lath in places and had evidently suffered much from all sorts of bad weather, rains, gales, and autumnal changes. Of the windows, only two were open, the rest being either shuttered or even boarded up. These two windows, for their part, were also weak-sighted; one of them had a dark triangle of blue sugar paper glued to it.","While Chichikov was mulling over and inwardly chuckling over the nickname which the muzhiks had bestowed upon Pliushkin, he had not noticed how he had driven into the center of a far-spreading settlement, with a multitude of huts and lanes. In a short while, however, a most jarring jolt, brought about by a corduroy roadway, a roadway before which the cobbled one in town was a mere nothing, let him perceive where he was.1 The logs of this roadway now rose, now fell, like the keys of a pianoforte, and the incautious rider acquired either a lump on the back of his neck, or a livid bruise on his forehead, or might even chance to nip, most painfully, the tip of his tongue between his teeth. He noticed some sort of especial tumbledown air over all the structures in the village; the logs of the huts were darkened and old; many of the roofs had gaps through which one could see the sky as through a sieve; on some only the roof-ridge remained up above—that, and the transverse poles which looked like ribs. Apparently the owners themselves had carried the shingles and planks off the roofs, reasoning, and quite justly at that, that the huts afforded no shelter from the rain, while in fine weather it’s dry and there’s no sense in coddling oneself indoors, when one can find room to spread out both at the tavern and on the highroad—in short, wherever you wish. The windows in the small huts were without panes; some were stuffed up with rags or a homespun jacket; the tiny railed balconies under the eaves which, for some unknown reason, are tacked onto some Russian huts, had become askew and weather-beaten, yet without acquiring any picturesqueness thereby. Behind the huts, in many places, were rows of enormous stacks of grain which had been stagnating there, as was very evident, for a long time; in hue they resembled old, badly baked brick; all sorts of weeds were growing on top of them, and here and there even a shrub would be clinging to one of the sides. The grain evidently belonged to the master. Out from behind the stacks of grain and the tumble-down roofs reared up and momentarily appeared and disappeared in the clear air, now on the right, now on the left, depending on the turns the carriage made, two village churches that were side by side; a deserted one of wood, and one of stone with yellowish walls; it was all in stains and blotches and with cracks everywhere. Parts of the proprietor’s house began to emerge, and finally, it came into full view at the spot where the chain of huts ended and was succeeded by a vegetable garden or cabbage patch that had been allowed to become a waste land, with a low picket fence, broken in some places, thrown about it. Like some decrepit invalid did this strange castle appear, long, inordinately long. In places it was of only one story, in others of two stories; on its darkened roof, which did not everywhere afford dependable protection to the house in its old age, two cupolas were sticking up, facing each other; both of them were rickety by now, devoid of the paint that had covered them at one time. The walls of the house showed cracks here and there that exposed the naked plastering and lath and, as one could see, had endured a great deal from inclement weather, rains, whirlwinds, and autumnal changes. Of the windows, only two were in use; the others were shuttered or simply boarded over. These two windows, for their part, were also purblind; on one of them a triangle of dark-blue paper, such as comes wrapped around sugar loaves, had been pasted."
"Гость, однако же, коснулся больше событий внутреннего мира. Заговорил о превратностях судьбы; уподобил жизнь свою судну посреди морей, гонимому отовсюду ветрами; упомянул о том, что должен был переменить много мест и должностей, что много потерпел за правду, что даже самая жизнь его была не раз в опасности со стороны врагов, и много еще рассказал он такого, из чего Тентетников мог видеть, что гость его был скорее практический человек.

He spoke of the vicissitudes of fate; likened his life to a ship in the midst of the seas, driven from everywhere by the winds; mentioned that he had to change many places and posts, that he suffered a lot for the truth, that even his very life was more than once in danger from enemies, and he told a lot more such that Tentetnikov could see that his guest was more of a practical person. At the conclusion of everything, he blew his nose into a white cambric handkerchief as loudly as Andrei Ivanovich had ever heard before. Sometimes you come across in an orchestra such a rogue-trumpet that, when enough is enough, it will seem that it grunted not in the orchestra, but in one's own ear. Exactly the same sound was heard in the awakened chambers of the dormant house, and immediately after it the fragrance of cologne followed, invisibly diffused by the deft shaking of a cambric handkerchief.","The visitor, however, touched rather upon the incidents of the inner world. He spoke of the mutability of destiny, compared his life to a ship in midocean, driven before the winds; referred to the fact that he had frequently had to change his appointments and his duties, that he had suffered a great deal in the cause of justice, that his life even had more than once been in danger from his enemies, and he said a great deal more from which Tyentyetnikov could gather that his visitor was rather a practical man. In conclusion he brought out a white cambric handkerchief and blew his nose more loudly than Andrey Ivanovitch had ever heard any one do. Sometimes in an orchestra there is a rascally trumpet which, when it gives a blast, seems to be blaring right in one ’s ear: such was the sound which echoed through the awakened rooms of the slumbering house, and it was immediately followed by an agreeable fragrance of eau-de-cologne, invisibly diffused by the deft flourish of the cambric pocket-handkerchief.","But the newcomer applied himself, rather, to phenomena of the internal world, saying that his life might be likened to a barque tossed on the crests of perfidious billows, that in his time he had been fated to play many parts, and that on more than one occasion his life had stood in danger at the hands of foes. At the same time, these tidings were communicated in a manner calculated to show that the speaker was also a man of PRACTICAL capabilities. In conclusion, the visitor took out a cambric pocket-handkerchief, and sneezed into it with a vehemence wholly new to Tientietnikov’s experience. In fact, the sneeze rather resembled the note which, at times, the trombone of an orchestra appears to utter not so much from its proper place on the platform as from the immediate neighbourhood of the listener’s ear. And as the echoes of the drowsy mansion resounded to the report of the explosion there followed upon the same a wave of perfume, skilfully wafted abroad with a flourish of the eau-de-Cologne-scented handkerchief.","The visitor, however, touched more upon events of the inner world. He started speaking about the adversities of fate; likened his life to a ship on the high seas, driven about by winds from every quarter; mentioned that he had had to change places and posts many times, that he had suffered much for the truth, that even his very life had more than once been in danger from enemies, and there was much else he said which let Tentetnikov see that his visitor was rather a practical man. In conclusion to it all he blew his nose into a white cambric handkerchief, so loudly that Andrei Ivanovich had never heard the like of it. Sometimes in an orchestra there is one rascally trumpet which, when it strikes up, seems to quack not in the orchestra but in one’s own ear. Exactly the same noise resounded in the awakened rooms of the dozing house, and was immediately followed by the fragrance of eau de cologne, invisibly diffused by an adroit shake of the cambric handkerchief.",

"— Я придумал вот что. Теперь, покуда новые ревижские сказки не поданы, у помещиков больших имений наберется немало, наряду с душами живыми, отбывших и умерших… Так, если, например, ваше превосходительство передадите мне их в таком виде, как бы они были живые, с совершением купчей крепости, я бы тогда эту крепость представил старику, и он, как ни вертись, а наследство бы мне отдал.","- Here's what I came up with.

If you will hand me over all the dead souls on your estate—hand them over to me exactly as though they were still alive, and were purchasable property—I will offer them to the old man, and then he will leave me his fortune.”","“Here’s what I’ve thought up. Right now, before the new census lists have been turned in, the owners of big estates may have, along with their living souls, also some that are departed and dead … So that if, for instance, Your Excellency were to hand them over to me as if they were alive, with a deed of purchase, I could then present this deed to the old man, and he, dodge as he may, will have to give me my inheritance.”",
"И на этом деревянном лице вдруг скользнул какой-то теплый луч, выразилось не чувство, а какое-то бледное отражение чувства, явление, подобное неожиданному появлению на поверхности вод утопающего, произведшему радостный крик в толпе, обступившей берег. Но напрасно обрадовавшиеся братья и сестры кидают с берега веревку и ждут, не мелькнет ли вновь спина или утомленные бореньем руки, — появление было последнее. Глухо все, и еще страшнее и пустыннее становится после того затихнувшая поверхность безответной стихии. Так и лицо Плюшкина вслед за мгновенно скользнувшим на нем чувством стало еще бесчувственней и еще пошлее.","And on this wooden face a warm ray suddenly glided, it was not a feeling that was expressed, but some kind of pale reflection of a feeling, a phenomenon similar to the unexpected appearance of a drowning man on the surface of the water, producing a joyful cry in the crowd surrounding the shore. But in vain, the brothers and sisters, overjoyed, throw a rope from the shore and wait for a glimpse of the back or hands weary from the struggle - this was the last appearance. Everything is deaf, and the surface of the unrequited element becomes even more terrible and deserted after that. So Plyushkin's face, following the feeling that instantly slipped over him, became even more insensitive and even more vulgar.","And, all at once, something like a ray of warmth glided over that wooden face, there was an expression not of feeling, but of a sort of pale reflection of feeling. It was an apparition, like the sudden appearance of a drowned man at the surface of the water, that calls forth a shout of joy in the crowd upon the bank; but in vain the rejoicing brothers and sisters let down a cord from the bank and wait for another glimpse of the back or the arms exhausted with struggling—that appearance was the last. All is still and the unrippled surface of the implacable element is still more terrible and desolate than before. So the face of Plyushkin, after the feeling that glided for an instant over it, looked harder and meaner than ever.","Over Plushkin’s wooden features there had gleamed a ray of warmth—a ray which expressed, if not feeling, at all events feeling’s pale reflection. Just such a phenomenon may be witnessed when, for a brief moment, a drowning man makes a last re-appearance on the surface of a river, and there rises from the crowd lining the banks a cry of hope that even yet the exhausted hands may clutch the rope which has been thrown him—may clutch it before the surface of the unstable element shall have resumed for ever its calm, dread vacuity. But the hope is short-lived, and the hands disappear. Even so did Plushkin’s face, after its momentary manifestation of feeling, become meaner and more insensible than ever.","And some warm ray suddenly passed over his wooden face, expressing not a feeling, but some pale reflection of a feeling, a phenomenon similar to the sudden appearance of a drowning man on the surface, drawing a joyful shout from the crowd on the bank.

"Разумеется, с этих пор знакомство между ними прекратилось, и любовь кончилась при самом начале. Потухнул свет, на минуту было перед ним блеснувший, и последовавшие за ним сумерки стали еще сумрачней. Байбак сызнова залез в халат свой. Все поворотило сызнова на лежанье и бездействие. В доме завелись гадость и беспорядок. Половая щетка оставалась по целому дню посреди комнаты вместе с сором. Панталоны заходили даже в гостиную. На щеголеватом столе перед диваном лежали засаленные подтяжки, точно какое угощенье гостю, и до того стала ничтожной и сонной его жизнь, что не только перестали уважать его дворовые люди, но даже чуть не клевали домашние куры. Бессильно чертил он на бумаге по целым часам рогульки, домики, избы, телеги, тройки или же выписывал «Милостивый государь!» с восклицательным знаком всеми почерками и характерами. А иногда же, все позабывши, перо чертило само собой, без ведома хозяина, маленькую головку с тонкими, острыми чертами, с приподнятой легкой прядью волос, упадавшей из-под гребня длинными тонкими кудрями, молодыми обнаженными руками, как бы летевшую, — и в изумленье видел хозяин, как выходил портрет той, с которой портрета не мог бы написать никакой живописец. И еще грустнее становилось ему потом, и, веря тому, что нет на земле счастья, оставался он на целый день скучным и безответным.","Of course, from that time on, the acquaintance between them ceased, and love ended at the very beginning. The light went out, for a moment it had flashed before him, and the twilight that followed it became even more gloomy. Baibak climbed back into his dressing gown. Everything turned again to lying and inaction. The house was filled with filth and disorder. The broom remained for the whole day in the middle of the room, along with rubbish. Pantaloons even entered the living room. On a dapper table in front of the sofa lay greasy suspenders, just like a treat for a guest, and his life became so insignificant and sleepy that not only the courtyard people ceased to respect him, but even domestic chickens almost pecked. Powerlessly, he drew on paper for hours on end flyers, houses, huts, carts, troikas, or wrote out “Dear sir!” with an exclamation mark in all handwriting and characters. And sometimes, forgetting everything, the pen drew by itself, without the knowledge of the owner, a small head with thin, sharp features, with a light strand of hair raised, falling from under the comb in long thin curls, with young bare hands, as if flying, - and into the owner saw amazement as a portrait of one from whom no painter could paint a portrait came out. And then he became even sadder, and, believing that there was no happiness on earth, he remained for the whole day boring and unanswered.","Their acquaintance was of course cut short from that time. Love ended as soon as it began; the light that had gleamed before him for one instant was quenched, and the gloom that followed it was darker than ever. The sluggard got back into his dressing-gown again. His life was again spent in lying about and doing nothing. Dirt and disorder reigned in the house: the broom remained in the room together with the dust for days together; his trousers even made their way into the drawing-room; on the elegant table in front of the sofa lay a pair of greasy braces as though it were a tit-bit for a guest. And his life became so drowsy and abject that not only his servants ceased to respect him, but even the hens almost pecked at him. For hours at a time he would scribble feebly, drawing crooked trees, little houses, huts, carts, sledges, or he would write ”Honoured Sir!“ with an exclamation mark after it in all sorts of handwritings and characters. And sometimes while he was still plunged in forgetfulness, his pen would of itself, without his knowledge, sketch a little head that seemed to be taking flight, with delicate pointed features, with a light tress of hair raised and falling from under the comb, in long, delicate curls, with bare youthful arms—and with amazement he saw that it had turned into a portrait of her whose portrait no artist could paint. And he was even more sorrowful after that, and believing that there was no happiness on earth he was depressed and hopeless for the rest of the day.","Nevertheless, the acquaintance broke off here, and with it any possibility of love-making. The light which had shed a momentary gleam before Tientietnikov’s eyes had become extinguished for ever, and upon it there followed a darkness denser than before. Henceforth everything conduced to evolve the regime which the reader has noted—that regime of sloth and inaction which converted Tientietnikov’s residence into a place of dirt and neglect. For days at a time would a broom and a heap of dust be left lying in the middle of a room, and trousers tossing about the salon, and pairs of worn-out braces adorning the what-not near the sofa. In short, so mean and untidy did Tientietnikov’s mode of life become, that not only his servants, but even his very poultry ceased to treat him with respect. Taking up a pen, he would spend hours in idly sketching houses, huts, waggons, troikas, and flourishes on a piece of paper; while at other times, when he had sunk into a reverie, the pen would, all unknowingly, sketch a small head which had delicate features, a pair of quick, penetrating eyes, and a raised coiffure. Then suddenly the dreamer would perceive, to his surprise, that the pen had executed the portrait of a maiden whose picture no artist could adequately have painted; and therewith his despondency would become greater than ever, and, believing that happiness did not exist on earth, he would relapse into increased ennui, increased neglect of his responsibilities.","Naturally, after that their acquaintance ceased, and love ended at its very beginning. Out went the light that had gleamed before him momentarily, and the gloom that followed became still gloomier. The sloth got into his dressing gown once again. Everything steered itself once again towards prostration and inaction. Nastiness and disorder came to the house. A broom stood for days on end in the middle of the room together with its sweepings. His trousers sometimes even stopped for a visit in the drawing room. On an elegant table in front of the sofa lay a pair of greasy suspenders, as a sort of treat for a guest, and so worthless and drowsy did his life become that not only did the house serfs stop respecting him, but even the barnyard chickens all but pecked him. He spent long hours impotently tracing doodles on paper—little houses, cottages, carts, troikas—or else writing “Dear Sir!” with an exclamation point in all sorts of hands and characters. And sometimes, all oblivious, the pen would trace of itself, without the master’s knowledge, a little head with fine, sharp features, with light, combed-up tresses, falling from behind the comb in long, delicate curls, young bared arms, as if flying off somewhere—and with amazement the master saw emerging the portrait of her whose portrait no artist could paint. And he would feel still sadder after that, and, believing that there was no happiness on earth, would remain dull and unresponsive for the rest of the day.",

"Андрей Иванович был нрава тихого. Он не участвовал в ночных оргиях с товарищами, которые, несмотря на строжайший присмотр, завели на стороне любовницу — одну на восемь человек, — ни также в других шалостях, доходивших до кощунства и насмешек над самою религиею из-за того только, что директор требовал частого хождения в церковь и попался плохой священник. Но он повесил нос. Честолюбье было возбуждено в нем сильно, а деятельности и поприща ему не было. Лучше б было и не возбуждать его! Он слушал горячившихся на кафедре профессоров, а вспоминал прежнего наставника, который, не горячась, умел говорить понятно. Он слушал и химию, и философию прав, и профессорские углубления во все тонкости политических наук, и всеобщую историю человечества в таком огромном виде, что профессор в три года успел только прочесть введение да развитие общин каких-то немецких городов; но все это оставалось в голове его какими-то безобразными клочками. Благодаря природному уму он чувствовал только, что не так должно преподаваться, а как — не знал. И вспоминал он часто об Александре Петровиче, и так ему бывало грустно, что не знал он, куда деться от тоски.","Andrei Ivanovich was of a quiet disposition. He did not participate in nightly orgies with his comrades, who, despite the strictest supervision, took a mistress on the side - one for eight people - nor in other pranks that amounted to blasphemy and ridicule of religion itself because of the fact that the director demanded frequent going to church and got a bad priest. But he hung up his nose. Ambition was strongly aroused in him, but he had no activity and career. It would be better not to excite him! He listened to the professors who got excited in the department, but he remembered his former mentor, who, without getting excited, knew how to speak clearly. He listened to chemistry, and the philosophy of rights, and professorial deepenings into all the subtleties of political science, and the general history of mankind in such a huge form that the professor only had time to read the introduction and development of the communities of some German cities in three years; but all this remained in his head as some ugly shreds. Thanks to his natural mind, he only felt that this was not how it should be taught, but he did not know how. And he often remembered Alexander Petrovich, and he felt so sad that he did not know where to escape from longing.","Andrey Ivanovitch was of a gentle disposition. He did not take part in the nightly orgies of his companions, who in spite of the strictest supervision had set up a mistress in the neighbourhood, one for eight of them, nor in their other evil courses which went as far as sacrilege and jeering at religion, just because the head master insisted upon their attending church very frequently. But he lost heart. His ambition had been stirred, but there was no activity, no career for him. It would have been better if it had never been aroused at all. He listened to the professors who grew hot in the lecture hall, and thought of his old master, who without getting hot, knew how to speak intelligibly. He heard lectures on chemistry, on the philosophy of law, and listened to the professors, as they went deeply into the subtleties of political science and the universal history of man conceived on such a vast scale that the professor only succeeded in treating of the introduction and development of guilds in some German towns in three years; but only some shapeless scraps of all this remained in his head. Thanks to his natural good sense, he saw that this was the wrong way to teach, but what was the right way he could not tell. And he often thought of Alexandr Petrovitch, and he used to be so sad that he did not know what to do for misery.","And sundry other things began to take place—things which necessitated many a penalty and expulsion; until, within a couple of years, no one who had known the school in former days would now have recognised it. Nevertheless Tientietnikov, a youth of retiring disposition, experienced no leanings towards the nocturnal orgies of his companions, orgies during which the latter used to flirt with damsels before the very windows of the headmaster’s rooms, nor yet towards their mockery of all that was sacred, simply because fate had cast in their way an injudicious priest. No, despite its dreaminess, his soul ever remembered its celestial origin, and could not be diverted from the path of virtue. Yet still he hung his head, for, while his ambition had come to life, it could find no sort of outlet. Truly ‘twere well if it had NOT come to life, for throughout the time that he was listening to professors who gesticulated on their chairs he could not help remembering the old preceptor who, invariably cool and calm, had yet known how to make himself understood. To what subjects, to what lectures, did the boy not have to listen!—to lectures on medicine, and on philosophy, and on law, and on a version of general history so enlarged that even three years failed to enable the professor to do more than finish the introduction thereto, and also the account of the development of some self-governing towns in Germany. None of the stuff remained fixed in Tientietnikov’s brain save as shapeless clots; for though his native intellect could not tell him how instruction ought to be imparted, it at least told him that THIS was not the way. And frequently, at such moments he would recall Alexander Petrovitch, and give way to such grief that scarcely did he know what he was doing.","Andrei Ivanovich was of a quiet disposition.

But he was downcast. Ambition had been strongly awakened in him, but there was no activity or career before him. It would have been better for him not to be awakened! He listened to the professors getting excited at the podium, and remembered his former mentor, who had known how to speak clearly without getting excited. He heard lectures in chemistry and the philosophy of law, and profound professorial analyses of all the subtleties of political science, and the universal history of mankind on such an enormous scale that in three years the professor managed only to give an introduction and to speak on the development of communes in some German cities; but all this remained as some sort of misshapen scraps in his head. Thanks to his natural intelligence, he simply felt that that was not how to teach, but how to teach—he did not know. And he often remembered Alexander Petrovich, and it made him so sad that he did not know where to turn for sorrow.",

"Ноздрев повел своих гостей полем, которое во многих местах состояло из кочек. Гости должны были пробираться между перелогами и взбороненными нивами. Чичиков начинал чувствовать усталость. Во многих местах ноги их выдавливали под собою воду, до такой степени место было низко. Сначала они было береглись и переступали осторожно, но потом, увидя, что это ни к чему не служит, брели прямо, не разбирая, где бо́льшая, а где меньшая грязь. Прошедши порядочное расстояние, увидели, точно, границу, состоявшую из деревянного столбика и узенького рва.","Nozdryov led his guests through the field, which in many places consisted of hummocks. The guests had to make their way between fallows and raised fields. Chichikov began to feel tired. In many places their feet squeezed the water under them, to such an extent the place was low. At first they were careful and stepped carefully, but then, seeing that this was of no use, they wandered straight, not making out where the dirt was more and where it was less. Having walked a decent distance, they saw, for sure, the border, which consisted of a wooden post and a narrow ditch.","Nozdryov led his visitors across fields which in many places were covered with hillocks. The guests had to make their way between rough fallow land and ploughed fields. Tchitchikov began to feel tired. In many places the water squelched up under their feet, it was such low-lying ground. At first they were careful and picked their way, but afterwards, seeing that it was of no use, walked straight on without looking out for the mud. After walking a considerable distance they did indeed see the boundary which consisted of a wooden post and a narrow ditch.","So saying, he started to conduct his guests across a field which consisted mostly of moleheaps, and in which the party had to pick their way between strips of ploughed land and of harrowed. Soon Chichikov began to feel weary, for the terrain was so low-lying that in many spots water could be heard squelching underfoot, and though for a while the visitors watched their feet, and stepped carefully, they soon perceived that such a course availed them nothing, and took to following their noses, without either selecting or avoiding the spots where the mire happened to be deeper or the reverse. At length, when a considerable distance had been covered, they caught sight of a boundary-post and a narrow ditch.","Nozdryov led his guests across the field, which in many places consisted of tussocks.

"— Да я вижу сам, что более благого дела не мог бы предпринять. Как бы то ни было, цель человека все еще не определена, если он не стал наконец твердой стопою на прочное основание, а не на какую-нибудь вольнодумную химеру юности. — Тут он весьма кстати выбранил за либерализм, и поделом, всех молодых людей. Но замечательно, что в словах его была все какая-то нетвердость, как будто бы тут же сказал он сам себе: «Эх, брат, врешь ты, да еще и сильно!» Он даже не взглянул на Собакевича и Манилова из боязни встретить что-нибудь на их лицах. Но напрасно боялся он: лицо Собакевича не шевельнулось, а Манилов, обвороженный фразою, от удовольствия только потряхивал одобрительно головою, погрузясь в такое положение, в каком находится любитель музыки, когда певица перещеголяла самую скрипку и пискнула такую тонкую ноту, какая невмочь и птичьему горлу.","Yes, I see for myself that I could not have undertaken a better deed. Be that as it may, a man's goal is still undetermined if he has not finally set his foot on a solid foundation, and not on some free-thinking chimera of youth. - Here he very opportunely scolded for liberalism, and rightly so, all young people. But it is remarkable that in his words there was still some kind of unsteadiness, as if he immediately said to himself: “Oh, brother, you are lying, and even more so!” He did not even look at Sobakevich and Manilov for fear of seeing something on their faces. But he was afraid in vain: Sobakevich's face did not move, and Manilov, enchanted by the phrase, only shook his head approvingly from pleasure, plunging into the position in which a music lover is when the singer outdid the violin itself and squeaked such a thin note that even a bird's throat could not stand it. .","“Yes, I see myself that I could not do anything that would be better. In any case a man’s goal remains undefined, if he does not firmly take his stand at last on a solid foundation and not on some free-thinking chimera of youth.” Hereupon he very appropriately fell to abusing the liberalism of all young people—not without reason, indeed. But it is a remarkable fact that there was all the while a lack of assurance in his words, as though he were saying to himself: “Ah, my lad, you are lying and lying hard too!” He did not even glance at Sobakevitch or Manilov for fear of detecting something in their faces. But he had no need to be afraid. Sobakevitch’s face did not stir a muscle, while Manilov, enchanted by his phrases, merely nodded his head approvingly in the attitude of a musical amateur when a prima donna outdoes the violin and shrills out a note higher than any bird’s throat could produce.","“I, too, conceive that I could not well have done better. The truth is that never until a man has driven home the piles of his life’s structure upon a lasting bottom, instead of upon the wayward chimeras of youth, will his aims in life assume a definite end.” And, that said, Chichikov went on to deliver himself of a very telling indictment of Liberalism and our modern young men. Yet in his words there seemed to lurk a certain lack of conviction. Somehow he seemed secretly to be saying to himself, “My good sir, you are talking the most absolute rubbish, and nothing but rubbish.” Nor did he even throw a glance at Sobakevitch and Manilov. It was as though he were uncertain what he might not encounter in their expression. Yet he need not have been afraid. Never once did Sobakevitch ’s face move a muscle, and, as for Manilov, he was too much under the spell of Chichikov’s eloquence to do aught beyond nod his approval at intervals, and strike the kind of attitude which is assumed by lovers of music when a lady singer has, in rivalry of an accompanying violin, produced a note whereof the shrillness would exceed even the capacity of a bird’s throstle.","“Yes, I myself can see that I could not have undertaken any better thing. However it may be, a man’s goal is never defined until he finally sets a firm foot on solid ground, and not on some freethinking chimera of youth.” Here he quite appropriately denounced all young people, and rightly so, for liberalism. Yet, remarkably, there was still some lack of firmness in his words, as if he were saying to himself at the same time: “Eh, brother, you’re lying, and mightily, too!” He did not even glance at Sobakevich and Manilov, for fear of encountering something on their faces. But he need not have feared: Sobakevich’s face did not stir, and Manilov, enchanted by the phrase, just kept shaking his head approvingly, immersed in that state in which a music lover finds himself when the soprano has outdone the fiddle itself and squeaked on such a high note as is even too much for the throat of a bird.","“Yes, I can see myself that I could not have done better. No matter how things are, man’s goal is still indeterminate as long as he has not placed his foot firmly upon some solid foundation instead of some freethinking chimera of youth.” At this point, quite fittingly, he chided all young people for their liberalism, and justly so. Yet, remarkably enough, there was a certain lack of assurance in his words, as though he had at the same time said to himself: “Eh, brother, but you’re lying, and mighty hard, at that!” He even avoided looking up at Sobakevich and Manilov, out of fear of detecting something on their faces. But his fears were groundless: Sobakevich’s face did not so much as twitch, and Manilov, bewitched by the apt phrase, was so pleased that he merely kept tossing his head approvingly from time to time, having plunged into that state in which a lover of music finds himself when some cantatrice has outdone the violin itself and has squeaked out so fine and high a note as is beyond the power of even a bird’s throat."

"В ворота гостиницы губернского города NN въехала довольно красивая рессорная небольшая бричка, в какой ездят холостяки: отставные подполковники, штабс-капитаны, помещики, имеющие около сотни душ крестьян, — словом, все те, которых называют господами средней руки. В бричке сидел господин, не красавец, но и не дурной наружности, ни слишком толст, ни слишком тонок; нельзя сказать, чтобы стар, однако ж и не так, чтобы слишком молод. Въезд его не произвел в городе совершенно никакого шума и не был сопровожден ничем особенным; только два русские мужика, стоявшие у дверей кабака против гостиницы, сделали кое-какие замечания, относившиеся, впрочем, более к экипажу, чем к сидевшему в нем. «Вишь ты, — сказал один другому, — вон какое колесо! что ты думаешь, доедет то колесо, если б случилось, в Москву или не доедет?» — «Доедет», — отвечал другой. «А в Казань-то, я думаю, не доедет?» — «В Казань не доедет», — отвечал другой. Этим разговор и кончился. Да еще, когда бричка подъехала к гостинице, встретился молодой человек в белых канифасовых панталонах, весьма узких и коротких, во фраке с покушеньями на моду, из-под которого видна была манишка, застегнутая тульскою булавкою с бронзовым пистолетом. Молодой человек оборотился назад, посмотрел экипаж, придержал рукою картуз, чуть не слетевший от ветра, и пошел своей дорогой.","At the gates of the hotel in the provincial town of NN, a rather beautiful spring-loaded small britzka drove in, in which bachelors ride: retired lieutenant colonels, staff captains, landowners with about a hundred souls of peasants - in a word, all those who are called gentlemen of the middle class. In the britzka sat a gentleman, not handsome, but not bad-looking either, neither too fat nor too thin; one cannot say that he is old, but it is not so that he is too young. His entry made absolutely no noise in the city and was not accompanied by anything special; only two Russian peasants, standing at the door of the tavern opposite the hotel, made some remarks, which, however, referred more to the carriage than to the person sitting in it. “You see,” one said to the other, “what a wheel! what do you think, will that wheel, if it happens, reach Moscow or not?” ""He'll get there,"" replied the other. “But I don’t think he will reach Kazan?” “He won’t get to Kazan,” answered another. This conversation ended. Moreover, when the britzka drove up to the hotel, a young man met in white kanifas trousers, very narrow and short, in a tailcoat with attempts on fashion, from under which was visible a shirt-front, fastened with a Tula pin with a bronze pistol. The young man turned back, looked at the carriage, held his cap, which was almost blown off by the wind, and went on his way.","A rather pretty little chaise on springs, such as bachelors, half-pay officers, staff captains, landowners with about a hundred serfsa—in short, all such as are spoken of as “gentlemen of the middling sort”—drive about in, rolled in at the gates of the hotel of the provincial town of N. In the chaise sat a gentleman, not handsome but not bad-looking, not too stout and not too thin; it could not be said that he was old, neither could he be described as extremely young. His arrival in the town created no sensation whatever and was not accompanied by anything remarkable. Only two Russian peasants standing at the door of the tavern facing the hotel made some observations, with reference, however, rather to the carriage than to its occupant. “My eye,” said one to the other, “isn’t that a wheel! What do you think? Would that wheel, if so it chanced, get to Moscow or would it never get there?” “It would,” answered the other. “But to Kazanb now, I don’t think it would get there?” “It wouldn’t get to Kazan,” answered the other. With that the conversation ended. Moreover, just as the chaise drove up to the hotel it was met by a young man in extremely short and narrow white canvas trousers, in a coat with fashionable cut-away tails and a shirt-front fastened with a Tulac breastpin adorned with a bronze pistol. The young man turned round, stared at the chaise, holding his cap which was almost flying off in the wind, and went on his way.","To the door of an inn in the provincial town of N. there drew up a smart britchka—a light spring-carriage of the sort affected by bachelors, retired lieutenant-colonels, staff-captains, land-owners possessed of about a hundred souls, and, in short, all persons who rank as gentlemen of the intermediate category. In the britchka was seated such a gentleman—a man who, though not handsome, was not ill-favoured, not over-fat, and not over-thin. Also, though not over-elderly, he was not over-young. His arrival produced no stir in the town, and was accompanied by no particular incident, beyond that a couple of peasants who happened to be standing at the door of a dramshop exchanged a few comments with reference to the equipage rather than to the individual who was seated in it. “Look at that carriage,” one of them said to the other. “Think you it will be going as far as Moscow?” “I think it will,” replied his companion. “But not as far as Kazan, eh?” “No, not as far as Kazan.” With that the conversation ended. Presently, as the britchka was approaching the inn, it was met by a young man in a pair of very short, very tight breeches of white dimity, a quasi-fashionable frockcoat, and a dickey fastened with a pistol-shaped bronze tie-pin. The young man turned his head as he passed the britchka and eyed it attentively; after which he clapped his hand to his cap (which was in danger of being removed by the wind) and resumed his way.","Through the gates of the inn in the provincial town of N. drove a rather handsome, smallish spring britzka, of the sort driven around in by bachelors: retired lieutenant colonels, staff captains, landowners possessed of some hundred peasant souls—in short, all those known as gentlemen of the middling sort. In the britzka sat a gentleman, not handsome, but also not bad-looking, neither too fat nor too thin; you could not have said he was old, yet neither was he all that young. His entrance caused no stir whatever in town and was accompanied by nothing special; only two Russian muzhiks standing by the door of the pot-house across from the inn made some remarks, which referred, however, more to the vehicle than to the person sitting in it. “See that?” said the one to the other, “there’s a wheel for you! What do you say, would that wheel make it as far as Moscow, if it so happened, or wouldn’t it?” “It would,” replied the other. “But not as far as Kazan I don’t suppose?” “Not as far as Kazan,” replied the other. And with that the conversation ended. Then, as the britzka drove up to the inn, it met with a young man in white twill trousers, quite narrow and short, and a tailcoat with presumptions to fashion, under which could be seen a shirtfront fastened with a Tula-made pin shaped like a bronze pistol.1 The young man turned around, looked at the carriage, held his hand to his peaked cap, which was almost blown off by the wind, and went on his way.","A rather handsome, light traveling carriage on springs rolled into the gates of an inn in a certain provincial capital, the kind of carriage that is favored by bachelors: retired lieutenant colonels, second captains, landowners possessing a hundred souls or so of serfs—in a word, all those who are called the fair-to-middlin’ sort. The gentleman seated in this carriage was not handsome, but he wasn’t bad to look at either; he was neither too stout nor too thin; you couldn’t say he was old, but still he wasn’t what you might call any too young either. His arrival created no stir whatever in the town of N— and was not coupled with any remarkable event; all the comments it called forth came from two Russian muzhiks standing in the doorway of a tavern across the way from the inn, comments which, however, had more to do with the carriage itself than with the man sitting in it. “Look at that, will you?” said one muzhik to the other. “ What a wheel! What do you think, would that wheel make it to Moscow, if need be, or wouldn’t it?” “It would,” answered the other. “But it wouldn’t make it to Kazan, I’m thinking—or would it?” “Not to Kazan, it wouldn’t,” the other answered. And with that the discussion ended. Also, as the carriage drove up to the inn, it encountered a young man in white dimity trousers, quite narrow and short, and a swallow-tailed coat that made a brave attempt at being in the mode, revealing a dickey fastened with a stickpin of Tula bronze in the shape of a pistol. The young man turned back, looked the vehicle over while clutching at his cap, which had been almost carried away by the wind, and then went on his way again."

"— Был управитель, ваше превосходительство, из немцев, молодой человек. По случаю поставки рекрут и прочего имел он надобность приезжать в город и, разумеется, подмазывать судейских. — Тут Чичиков, прищуря глаз, выразил в лице своем, как подмазываются судейские. — Впрочем, и они тоже полюбили, угощали его. Вот как-то один раз у них на обеде говорит он: «Что ж, господа, когда-нибудь и ко мне, в имение к князю». Говорят: «Приедем». Скоро после того случилось выехать суду на следствие, по делу, случившемуся во владениях графа Трехметьева, которого, ваше превосходительство, без сомнения, тоже изволите знать.","- There was a steward, Your Excellency, from the Germans, a young man. On the occasion of the delivery of a recruit and other things, he had the need to come to the city and, of course, grease up the judges. - Here Chichikov, screwing up his eyes, expressed in his face how the judges grease up. - However, they also fell in love, treated him. Once, at a dinner, he said: “Well, gentlemen, someday to me, on the prince’s estate.” They say: ""Come."" Soon after that, the court happened to leave for an investigation, in a case that happened in the possessions of Count Trekhmetyev, whom, Your Excellency, no doubt, you also deign to know.","“... There was a steward, your Excellency, a young man and a German. He had to go to the town about the levy of recruits and other business, and of course he had to grease the hands of the court officials. They liked him however and entertained him. So one day when he was at dinner with them, he said: ‘Well, gentlemen, I hope one day you will come and see me on the prince’s estate.’ They said: ‘We’ll come.’ It happened not long afterwards that the court had to conduct an examination on the estate of Count Trehmetyev, whom no doubt your Excellency knows also.”","And you, sir,” he added to Chichikov, “will you not join us at table?”","“There was a steward, Your Excellency, of German stock, a young man. He had to go to town for supplying recruits and on other occasions, and, of course, to grease the palms of the court clerks.” Here Chichikov, narrowing one eye, showed with his face how court clerks’ palms are greased. “However, they also liked him and used to wine and dine him. So once, at dinner with them, he said: ‘You know, gentlemen, one day you must also visit me on the prince’s estate.’ They said: ‘We will.’ Soon after that the court happened to go to investigate a case that occurred on the domains of Count Trekhmetyev, whom Your Excellency is no doubt also pleased to know.”",

Such a straightforward, open character; there is a look of such simple warm-heartedness in his face.”","Accordingly he added aloud: “For my own part, I should give the preference to the Head of the Gendarmery.

"Чудная, однако же, вещь: на другой день, когда подали Чичикову лошадей и вскочил он в коляску с легкостью почти военного человека, одетый в новый фрак, белый галстук и жилет, и покатился свидетельствовать почтение генералу, Тентетников пришел в такое волненье духа, какого давно не испытывал. Весь этот ржавый и дремлющий ход его мыслей превратился в деятельно-беспокойный. Возмущенье нервическое обуяло вдруг всеми чувствами доселе погруженного в беспечную лень байбака. То садился он на диван, то подходил к окну, то принимался за книгу, то хотел мыслить, — безуспешное хотенье! — мысль не лезла к нему в голову. То старался ни о чем не мыслить, — безуспешное старание! — отрывки чего-то похожего на мысли, концы и хвостики мыслей лезли и отовсюду наклевывались к нему в голову. «Странное состоянье!» — сказал он и придвинулся к окну глядеть на дорогу, прорезавшую дуброву, в конце которой еще курилась не успевшая улечься пыль, поднятая уехавшей коляской. Но оставим Тентетникова и последуем за Чичиковым.","A wonderful thing, however: the next day, when they gave Chichikov horses and he jumped into the carriage with the ease of an almost military man, dressed in a new tailcoat, white tie and waistcoat, and rolled off to pay respect to the general, Tentetnikov came into such agitation of the spirit, what haven't experienced it for a long time. All this rusty and dormant train of his thoughts turned into an active and restless one. Nervous indignation suddenly seized with all the feelings hitherto immersed in careless laziness the bobak. Now he sat down on the sofa, now he went up to the window, now he began to read a book, now he wanted to think—unsuccessful longing! The thought didn't cross his mind. Then he tried not to think about anything - an unsuccessful effort! - fragments of something similar to thoughts, the ends and tails of thoughts climbed and pecked into his head from everywhere. ""Strange condition!"" he said, and moved closer to the window to look at the road cutting through the oak trees, at the end of which the dust that had not yet settled, raised by the departing carriage, was still smoking. But let us leave Tentetnikov and follow Chichikov.","Strange to relate, however, next morning when the carriage was brought round for Tchitchikov and he jumped into it with the lightness almost of a military man, wearing his new dress-coat, white cravat and waistcoat, and rolled off to pay his respects to the general, Tyentyetnikov was thrown into an agitation such as he had not experienced for a long time. The whole current of his ideas which had been slumbering and had grown dull were awakened to restless activity. All the feelings of the idler, who had hitherto been plunged in careless sloth, were suddenly caught up in a nervous tumult. At one moment he sat down on the sofa, then he went to the window, then he took up a book, then he tried to think. A fruitless attempt! A thought would not come into his head. Then he tried to think of nothing at all. A fruitless effort. Fragments of something like thought, shreds and ends of thoughts forced themselves on him and pecked at his brain from all sides. “ What a strange condition!” he said, and moving towards the window, looked out at the road which was intersected by the oak copse, and at the end of it he saw still floating in the air the dust raised by the carriage.","“A strange fellow, this Tientietnikov!” thought Chichikov, and then added aloud: “Yes, I will go and see him at ten o’clock to-morrow; but since my britchka is not yet altogether in travelling order, would you be so good as to lend me your koliaska for the purpose?”","An odd thing, however: the next day, when Chichikov’s horses were ready, and he leaped into the carriage with the ease of an almost military man, dressed in a new tailcoat, a white tie and waistcoat, and drove off to pay his respects to the general, Tentetnikov felt an agitation in his soul such as he had not experienced for a long time. All the rusty and drowsy course of his thoughts turned into an actively troubled one. A nervous excitement came over all the feelings of the sloth who hitherto had been sunk in careless indolence. Now he sat down on the sofa, now he went to the window, now he would take up a book, now he wanted to think— futile wanting!—thought refused to come into his head. Now he attempted not to think about anything—futile attempt!—scraps of something resembling thoughts, odds and ends of thoughts, kept creeping and pecking into his head from everywhere. “A strange state!” he said and moved to the window to gaze at the road cutting through the grove, at the end of which the clouds of dust raised by the departing carriage had not yet had time to settle. But let us leave Tentetnikov and follow Chichikov.",

"Очень сомнительно, чтобы избранный нами герой понравился читателям. Дамам он не понравится, это можно сказать утвердительно, ибо дамы требуют, чтоб герой был решительное совершенство, и если какое-нибудь душевное или телесное пятнышко, тогда беда! Как глубоко ни загляни автор ему в душу, хоть отрази чище зеркала его образ, ему не дадут никакой цены. Самая полнота и средние лета Чичикова много повредят ему: полноты ни в каком случае не простят герою, и весьма многие дамы, отворотившись, скажут: «Фи, такой гадкий!» Увы! все это известно автору, и при всем том он не может взять в герои добродетельного человека, но… может быть, в сей же самой повести почуются иные, еще доселе не бранные струны, предстанет несметное богатство русского духа, пройдет муж, одаренный божескими доблестями, или чудная русская девица, какой не сыскать нигде в мире, со всей дивной красотой женской души, вся из великодушного стремления и самоотвержения. И мертвыми покажутся пред ними все добродетельные люди других племен, как мертва книга пред живым словом! Подымутся русские движения… и увидят, как глубоко заронилось в славянскую природу то, что скользнуло только по природе других народов… Но к чему и зачем говорить о том, что впереди? Неприлично автору, будучи давно уже мужем, воспитанному суровой внутренней жизнью и свежительной трезвостью уединения, забываться подобно юноше. Всему свой черед, и место, и время! А добродетельный человек все-таки не взят в герои. И можно даже сказать, почему не взят. Потому что пора наконец дать отдых бедному добродетельному человеку, потому что праздно вращается на устах слово «добродетельный человек»; потому что обратили в лошадь добродетельного человека, и нет писателя, который бы не ездил на нем, понукая и кнутом и всем чем ни попало; потому что изморили добродетельного человека до того, что теперь нет на нем и тени добродетели, а остались только ребра да кожа вместо тела; потому что лицемерно призывают добродетельного человека; потому что не уважают добродетельного человека. Нет, пора наконец припрячь и подлеца. Итак, припряжем подлеца!","It is very doubtful that the hero chosen by us will be liked by readers. The ladies will not like him, this can be said in the affirmative, because the ladies demand that the hero be a decisive perfection, and if there is any mental or bodily speck, then trouble! No matter how deeply the author looks into his soul, even though the mirror reflects his image more clearly, he will not be given any price. The very fullness and middle years of Chichikov will hurt him a lot: fullness will in no case be forgiven for the hero, and quite a few ladies, turning away, will say: “Fie, so ugly!” Alas! All this is known to the author, and for all that, he cannot take a virtuous person as a hero, but ... perhaps in the same story, other strings that have not yet been scolded will be felt, the incalculable wealth of the Russian spirit will appear, a husband gifted with divine valor will pass by, or a marvelous Russian maiden, which cannot be found anywhere else in the world, with all the wondrous beauty of a woman's soul, all of generous striving and self-sacrifice. And all the virtuous people of other tribes will appear dead before them, just as a book is dead before the living word! Russian movements will rise up… and they will see how deep into Slavic nature that which slipped only through the nature of other peoples… But why and why talk about what lies ahead? It is indecent for the author, who has long been a husband, brought up by a harsh inner life and the fresh sobriety of solitude, to forget himself like a young man. Everything has its turn, and place, and time! But a virtuous person is still not taken as a hero. And you can even say why not taken. Because it is time to finally give rest to the poor virtuous person, because the word “virtuous person” is idly revolving on the lips; because they turned a virtuous man into a horse, and there is no writer who would not ride him, goading him with a whip and everything else; because they have exhausted a virtuous person to the point that now there is not even a shadow of virtue on him, but only ribs and skin instead of a body remain; because they hypocritically call for a virtuous person; because they do not respect a virtuous person. No, it's time to finally hide the scoundrel. So let's harness the scoundrel!","It is very doubtful whether the reader will like the hero we have selected. That he will not please the ladies one may say with certainty, for ladies insist on a hero’s being absolute perfection, and if he has some tiny spiritual or physical blemish then—there’s trouble! However deeply the author gazes into his soul, and though he may reflect it more clearly than a mirror, they will give him no credit for it. Tchitchikov’s very stoutness and middle age will do him great damage in their eyes: they will never forgive stoutness in a hero under any circumstances, and very many ladies will turn away, saying, Fie! what a horrid man! Alas! the author is very well aware of all this, and yet he cannot take a virtuous man for his hero. But ... perhaps in this very novel some chords hitherto unstruck may be discerned, the infinite wealth of the Russian soul may be set forth, a man endowed with divine qualities, or a wonderful Russian maiden, such as cannot be found elsewhere in the world, with the marvellous beauty of a woman’s soul made up of generous impulse and self-sacrifice, may emerge. And all the virtuous people of other races will seem dead beside them as a book is dead beside the living word! Russian emotions will arise. They will see how deeply what has only glided through the nature of other peoples has taken root in the nature of the Russians.... But what use or reason is there to speak of what is in the future? It is unseemly for the author, a man of full age, disciplined by a harsh inner life and the invigorating sobriety of solitude, to forget himself like a boy. There is a fitting time and place for everything! But all the same I have not taken a virtuous man for my hero. And I may even say why I have not. Because it is high time at last to let the poor virtuous man rest; because the phrase “virtuous man” is too often taken in vain, because they have made a regular hack of the virtuous man and there is not a writer who has not ridden him to death, lashing him on with whip or anything that comes to hand; because they have so overdone the virtuous man that there is not a shadow of virtue left about him, and he is nothing but skin and bone; because it is through hypocrisy they invoke the virtuous man; because the virtuous man is not respected. No, the time has come at last to trot out the rascal! And so let us trot out the rascal!","Whether the character whom I have selected for my hero has pleased my readers is, of course, exceedingly doubtful. At all events the ladies will have failed to approve him for the fair sex demands in a hero perfection, and, should there be the least mental or physical stain on him— well, woe betide! Yes, no matter how profoundly the author may probe that hero’s soul, no matter how clearly he may portray his figure as in a mirror, he will be given no credit for the achievement. Indeed, Chichikov’s very stoutness and plenitude of years may have militated against him, for never is a hero pardoned for the former, and the majority of ladies will, in such case, turn away, and mutter to themselves: “Phew! What a beast!” Yes, the author is well aware of this. Yet, though he could not, to save his life, take a person of virtue for his principal character, it may be that this story contains themes never before selected, and that in it there projects the whole boundless wealth of Russian psychology; that it portrays, as well as Chichikov, the peasant who is gifted with the virtues which God has sent him, and the marvellous maiden of Russia who has not her like in all the world for her beautiful feminine spirituality, the roots of which lie buried in noble aspirations and boundless self-denial. In fact, compared with these types, the virtuous of other races seem lifeless, as does an inanimate volume when compared with the living word. Yes, each time that there arises in Russia a movement of thought, it becomes clear that the movement sinks deep into the Slavonic nature where it would but have skimmed the surface of other nations.—But why am I talking like this? Whither am I tending? It is indeed shameful that an author who long ago reached man’s estate, and was brought up to a course of severe introspection and sober, solitary self-enlightenment, should give way to such jejune wandering from the point. To everything its proper time and place and turn. As I was saying, it does not lie in me to take a virtuous character for my hero: and I will tell you why. It is because it is high time that a rest were given to the “poor, but virtuous” individual; it is because the phrase “a man of worth” has grown into a by-word; it is because the “man of worth” has become converted into a horse, and there is not a writer but rides him and flogs him, in and out of season; it is because the “man of worth” has been starved until he has not a shred of his virtue left, and all that remains of his body is but the ribs and the hide; it is because the “man of worth” is for ever being smuggled upon the scene; it is because the “man of worth” has at length forfeited every one’s respect. For these reasons do I reaffirm that it is high time to yoke a rascal to the shafts. Let us yoke that rascal.","It is highly doubtful that readers will like the hero we have chosen. The ladies will not like him, that can be said positively, for the ladies demand that a hero be a decided perfection, and if there is any little spot on his soul or body, it means trouble! However deeply the author peers into his soul, reflecting his image more purely than a mirror, it will be of no avail. The very plumpness and middle age of Chichikov will do him great harm: plumpness will in no way be forgiven a hero, and a great many ladies will turn away, saying: “Fie, ugly thing!” Alas! all this is known to the author, yet for all that he cannot take a virtuous man as his hero, but … perhaps in this same story some other , as yet untouched strings will be felt, the inestimable wealth of the Russian spirit will step forth, a man endowed with divine valor will pass by, or some wondrous Russian maiden such as can be found nowhere in the world, with all the marvelous beauty of a woman’s soul, all magnanimous aspiration and self-denial. And all virtuous people of other tribes will seem dead next to them, as a book is dead next to the living word! Russian movements will arise … and it will be seen how deeply that which has only grazed the nature of other peoples has sunk into the Slavic nature … But wherefore and why speak of what lies ahead? It is unbecoming for the author, a man long since taught by a stern inner life and the refreshing sobriety of solitude, to forget himself like a youth. Everything in its turn, its place, its time! But all the same the virtuous man has not been taken as a hero. And it is even possible to say why he has not been taken. Because it is time finally to give the poor virtuous man a rest, because the phrase “virtuous man” idly circulates on all lips; because the virtuous man has been turned into a horse, and there is no writer who has not driven him, urging him on with a whip and whatever else is handy; because the virtuous man has been so worn out that there is not even the ghost of any virtue left in him, but only skin and ribs instead of a body; because the virtuous man is invoked hypocritically; because the virtuous man is not respected! No, it is time finally to hitch up a scoundrel. And so, let us hitch up a scoundrel.","It is very much to be doubted if the hero we have chosen has proven to the liking of the readers. He wont be to the liking of the ladies, that we can state positively, since the ladies demand that the hero be utter perfection and if there be any spiritual or bodily blemish in him, no matter how slight, why, it’s just too bad! No matter how deeply the author peer into his soul, though he reflect his image more clearly than a mirror, they won’t have him at any price. The very corpulence and middle age of Chichikov will be much to his detriment, for corpulence is under no circumstances forgivable in a hero, and quite a great number of ladies will turn away and say: “Faugh! What a repulsive fellow!” Alas! The author is fully aware of all this, yet for all that he cannot take a virtuous man as a hero. But... it may befall that in this very narrative other chords, as yet unstruck, will be heard, that the incalculable riches of the Russian spirit will be set forth, that a man endowed with divine attributes of valor and virtue, or a wonderful Russian maiden, such as is not to be found anywhere else in the world, with all the wondrous beauty of a woman’s soul, all compact of magnanimous striving and self-denial, may yet pass through our pages. And all the virtuous people of other tribes will seem dead beside them, even as a book is dead before the living word! Russian emotions will spring into life ... and the readers will perceive how deeply has been implanted in the Slavic nature that which has but skimmed the surface of the nature of other peoples.... But why and wherefore speak of that which lies ahead? It is unseemly in the author, who has long since been a man schooled by a rigorous inner life and the invigorating sobriety of solitude, to forget himself like a mere callow youth. There is a turn, and a place, and a time for everything! But, just the same, we have not taken a man of virtue for our hero, after all. And one may even explain why he hasn’t been taken. Because it’s high time to give a rest to the poor man of virtue; because the phrase “man of virtue” is formed all too glibly and idly by all lips; because the man of virtue has been turned into a hack and there isn’t a writer who doesn’t ride him hard, urging him on with a whip or whatever else comes to his hand; because they have overworked the man of virtue to such an extent that now there isn’t even a shadow of virtue about him, and there is noth ing but skin and bones left of him instead of flesh and blood; because it is only through hypocrisy that they trot out the man of virtue; because the man of virtue isn’t held in much respect. No, it’s high time, at last, to put an actual scoundrel in harness! And so let us harness a scoundrel."

Answer me at once.” “Yes, I did know it,” replied Selifan, hanging his head.","“You scoundrel!” cried Chichikov, clasping his hands, and he came up so close to him that Selifan, for fear the master might make him a little gift, backed off a bit and stepped aside. “So you’re going to kill me, eh? want to put a knife in me? knife me on the high road , you robber, you cursed pig, you sea monster! eh? eh? Sat here for three weeks, eh? If you’d only made a peep, you wastrel—and now you’ve pushed it right up to the final hour! when everything’s almost set—just get in and go, eh? and it’s here that you muck it up, eh? eh? Didn’t you know before? didn’t you, eh? eh? Answer! Didn’t you know?”","“You scoundrel!” Chichikov cried out, wringing his hands, and walked up so close to him that Selifan, out of fear of receiving a free gift from him, backed away and sidestepped. “Do you want to be the death of me, eh? Do you want to slit my throat? Have you set your mind on slitting my throat on the highway, you robber, you damned swine, you sea monster, you! Eh? Eh? We’ve been sitting in this one spot for three weeks now, haven’t we, eh? If you’d only given me an inkling, you shiftless lout—but no, now, at the eleventh hour, you let me have it all at once! When everything is all set to get in the carriage and be off, eh? So that’s the very time you have to go and play me a dirty trick like that, eh? Eh? For you knew all this before, didn’t you? For you did know it, eh? Eh? Answer me! You did know? Eh?”"
"Что значили эти рыданья? Обнаруживала ли ими болеющая душа скорбную тайну своей болезни, что не успел образоваться и окрепнуть начинавший в нем строиться высокий внутренний человек; что, не испытанный измлада в борьбе с неудачами, не достигнул он до высокого состоянья возвышаться и крепнуть от преград и препятствий; что, растопившись, подобно разогретому металлу, богатый запас великих ощущений не принял последней закалки, и теперь, без упругости, бессильна его воля; что слишком для него рано умер необыкновенный наставник и нет теперь никого во всем свете, кто бы был в силах воздвигнуть и поднять шатаемые вечными колебаньями силы и лишенную упругости немощную волю, — кто бы крикнул живым, пробуждающим голосом, — крикнул душе пробуждающее слово: вперед! — которого жаждет повсюду, на всех ступенях стоящий, всех сословий, званий и промыслов, русский человек?","What did these sobs mean? Did the ailing soul reveal by them the mournful secret of his illness, that the high inner man that began to be built in him did not have time to form and grow stronger; that, having not experienced childhood in the fight against failures, he did not reach a high state of rising and becoming stronger from barriers and obstacles; that, having melted like heated metal, the rich store of great sensations did not take on the final hardening, and now, without elasticity, his will is powerless; that an extraordinary mentor died too early for him, and now there is no one in the whole world who would have the strength to raise up and raise the forces shattered by eternal fluctuations and the weak will devoid of elasticity - who would cry out in a living, awakening voice - shouted the awakening word to the soul: forward ! - which is longed for everywhere, standing on all steps, of all classes, ranks and trades, a Russian person?","What did those sobs mean? Did his sick soul betray in them the sorrowful secret of its sickness—that the fine inner man, that had begun to be formed within him, had not had time to develop and grow strong; that unpractised in the struggle with failure he had never attained the precious faculty of rising to higher things and gaining strength from obstacles and difficulties; that the rich treasure of lofty feelings that had glowed within him like molten metal had not been tempered like steel, and now his will had no elasticity and was impotent; that his rare, marvellous teacher had died too soon, and now there was no one in the whole world who could rouse and awaken his forces, flagging from continual hesitation, and his weak, impotent will—who could cry to the soul in a living, rousing voice, the rousing word: “ Forward!” which the Russian, at every stage, in every condition and calling, thirsts to hear?","What meant these repinings? Was there not disclosed in them the secret of his galling spiritual pain—the fact that he had failed to order his life aright, to confirm the lofty aims with which he had started his course; the fact that, always poorly equipped with experience, he had failed to attain the better and the higher state, and there to strengthen himself for the overcoming of hindrances and obstacles; the fact that, dissolving like overheated metal, his bounteous store of superior instincts had failed to take the final tempering; the fact that the tutor of his boyhood, a man in a thousand, had prematurely died, and left to Tientietnikov no one who could restore to him the moral strength shattered by vacillation and the will power weakened by want of virility—no one, in short, who could cry hearteningly to his soul “Forward!”—the word for which the Russian of every degree, of every class, of every occupation, of every school of thought, is for ever hungering. Indeed, WHERE is the man who can cry aloud for any of us, in the Russian tongue dear to our soul, the all-compelling command “Forward!”?","What was the meaning of this weeping? Was his aching soul thereby revealing the doleful mystery of its illness—that the lofty inner man who was beginning to be built in him had had no time to form and gain strength; that, not tried from early years in the struggle with failure , he had never attained the lofty ability to rise and gain strength from obstacles and barriers; that, having melted like heated metal, the wealth of great feelings had not been subjected to a final tempering, and now, lacking resilience, his will was powerless; that an extraordinary mentor had died too soon, and there was no longer anyone in the whole world capable of raising and holding up those forces rocked by eternal vacillation and that feeble will lacking in resilience—who could cry out in a live and rousing voice—cry out to his soul the rousing word : forward!—which the Russian man everywhere, at every level of rank, title, and occupation, yearns for?",
"— Не хочу! — сказал Чичиков и поднес, однако ж, обе руки на всякий случай поближе к лицу, ибо дело становилось в самом деле жарко.","- I do not want! said Chichikov, and, however, raised both hands, just in case, closer to his face, for the matter was getting really hot.","said Nozdryov, advancing closer. “No,” said Tchitchikov, and at the same time he brought both his hands nearer to his face in case of need, for things were really getting rather too hot for him.","And Nozdrev approached a step nearer. “Very well; I DO say that,” replied Chichikov, and at the same moment raised his hands towards his face, for the dispute was growing heated.","“No, tell me straight out that you don’t want to play,” Nozdryov said, stepping still closer. “I don’t!” said Chichikov, bringing both hands closer to his face anyhow, just in case, for things were indeed getting heated.","“No, I don’t want to,” said Chichikov but, just the same, brought both his hands nearer his face, against any contingency, since things were really getting hot."
"Уже несколько минут стоял Плюшкин, не говоря ни слова, а Чичиков все еще не мог начать разговора, развлеченный как видом самого хозяина, так и всего того, что было в его комнате. Долго не мог он придумать, в каких бы словах изъяснять причину своего посещения. Он уже хотел было выразиться в таком духе, что, наслышась о добродетели и редких свойствах души его, почел долгом принести лично дань уважения, но спохватился и почувствовал, что это слишком. Искоса бросив еще один взгляд на все, что было в комнате, он почувствовал, что слово «добродетель» и «редкие свойства души» можно с успехом заменить словами «экономия» и «порядок»; и потому, преобразивши таким образом речь, он сказал, что, наслышась об экономии его и редком управлении имениями, он почел за долг познакомиться и принести лично свое почтение. Конечно, можно было бы привести иную, лучшую причину, но ничего иного не взбрело тогда на ум.","Plyushkin had been standing for several minutes without saying a word, but Chichikov was still unable to start a conversation, entertained both by the sight of the owner himself and by everything that was in his room. For a long time he could not think of any words to explain the reason for his visit. He was about to express himself in such a spirit that, having heard a lot about virtue and the rare properties of his soul, he considered it his duty to personally pay tribute, but he caught himself and felt that this was too much. Throwing another sidelong glance at everything that was in the room, he felt that the words ""virtue"" and ""rare properties of the soul"" could be successfully replaced by the words ""economy"" and ""order""; and therefore, thus transforming his speech, he said that, having heard a lot about his economy and the rare management of estates, he considered it a duty to make acquaintance and pay his respects personally. Of course, another, better reason could have been given, but nothing else came to mind then.","Plyushkin had been standing for some minutes without uttering a word, and still Tchitchikov, distracted both by the appearance of the landowner himself and by all that was in his room, could not think how to begin the conversation. For a long while he could not imagine in what words to explain the object of his visit. He had intended to use some such expression as “that having heard of his virtues and the rare qualities of his soul, he had thought it his duty to pay him his respects in person”; but he hesitated and felt that this was too much. Casting another sidelong look at all the things in the room, he felt that the words “virtues” or “rare qualities of soul,” might be suitably replaced by the words “economy” and “good management,” and so, adapting his speech accordingly, he said, that, having heard of his economy and rare skill in the management of his estates, he had thought it his duty to make his acquaintance and pay his respects in person. No doubt a better reason might have been found, but nothing else occurred to him at the moment.","For several minutes Plushkin stood mute, while Chichikov remained so dazed with the appearance of the host and everything else in the room, that he too, could not begin a conversation, but stood wondering how best to find words in which to explain the object of his visit. For a while he thought of expressing himself to the effect that, having heard so much of his host’s benevolence and other rare qualities of spirit, he had considered it his duty to come and pay a tribute of respect; but presently even HE came to the conclusion that this would be overdoing the thing, and, after another glance round the room, decided that the phrase “benevolence and other rare qualities of spirit” might to advantage give place to “economy and genius for method.” Accordingly, the speech mentally composed, he said aloud that, having heard of Plushkin’s talents for thrifty and systematic management , he had considered himself bound to make the acquaintance of his host, and to present him with his personal compliments (I need hardly say that Chichikov could easily have alleged a better reason, had any better one happened, at the moment, to have come into his head).","For several minutes already Plyushkin had been standing there, not saying a word, yet Chichikov was still unable to begin talking, distracted as much by the look of the master himself as by all that was in his room. For a long time he was unable to think up any words to explain the reason for his visit. He was just about to express himself in some such spirit as, having heard of his virtue and the rare qualities of his soul, he felt it his duty personally to pay a tribute of respect, but he checked himself, feeling it was too much. Casting one more sidelong glance at all that was in the room, he felt that the words “virtue” and “rare qualities of soul” could successfully be replaced by the words “economy” and “order”; and therefore, transforming the speech in this manner, he said that, having heard of his economy and rare skill in running his estate, he felt it his duty to make his acquaintance and offer his respects personally. Of course, it would have been possible to produce another, better reason, but nothing else came into his head just then.","Pliushkin had been standing thus for several minutes by now, without uttering a word, while Chichikov still could not begin a conversation, being distracted both by the appearance of his host and by everything in his room. For a long time he could not hit upon the words with which to explain the reason for his coming. He was just about to express himself in some such high-flown vein as that, having heard such a great deal about his virtue and the rare qualities of his soul, he had deemed it his duty to pay him his due tribute of respect in person; but he brought himself up short and sensed that this was a bit much. Casting another look out of the corner of his eye at all the things in the room, he sensed that for such words as virtue and rare qualities of the soul one might well substitute the words economy and orderliness, and for that reason, having reworked his speech accordingly, he said that having heard of Pliushkin’s economy and his rare skill in estate management, he had deemed it his duty to make his acquaintance and to pay him his respects in person. Of course, he might have given another and a better reason, but at the time nothing else popped into his head."
"— Эй, борода! а как проехать отсюда к Плюшкину, так чтоб не мимо господского дома?","- Hey beard! but how to get from here to Plyushkin, so as not to pass by the master's house?","“Hey, bushy beard! How’s one to get from here to Plyushkin’s without passing your master’s house?”",“Hi!” shouted Chichikov. “How can I reach landowner Plushkin’s place without first going past the mansion here?”,"“Hey, graybeard! how can I get from here to Plyushkin’s, so as not to go past the master’s house?”","“Hey, there, you with the beard! How does one drive from here to Pliushkin’s place, but so’s not to drive past the master’s house?”"
— Куды ж ехать?,— Where to go?,“Where could I go?”,“But whither?”,“Where to?”,
"— Извольте, по полтине прибавлю.","- Excuse me, I'll add a half.","“Well, if you like I’ll say another half rouble.”","“However, I will add another half-rouble.” And he did so.","“If you please, I’ll add fifty kopecks.”","“I’ll give him a half-ruble more per soul, the dog, by way of a tip!”—“I’ll add on half a ruble for each, if you like.”"
"Так рассуждая, Селифан забрался наконец в самые отдаленные отвлеченности. Если бы Чичиков прислушался, то узнал бы много подробностей, относившихся лично к нему; но мысли его так были заняты своим предметом, что один только сильный удар грома заставил его очнуться и посмотреть вокруг себя; все небо было совершенно обложено тучами, и пыльная почтовая дорога опрыскалась каплями дождя. Наконец громовый удар раздался в другой раз громче и ближе, и дождь хлынул вдруг как из ведра. Сначала, принявши косое направление, хлестал он в одну сторону кузова кибитки, потом в другую, потом, изменив и образ нападения и сделавшись совершенно прямым, барабанил прямо в верх его кузова; брызги наконец стали долетать ему в лицо. Это заставило его задернуться кожаными занавесками с двумя круглыми окошечками, определенными на рассматривание дорожных видов, и приказать Селифану ехать скорее. Селифан, прерванный тоже на самой середине речи, смекнул, что, точно, не нужно мешкать, вытащил тут же из-под козел какую-то дрянь из серого сукна, надел ее в рукава, схватил в руки вожжи и прикрикнул на свою тройку, которая чуть-чуть переступала ногами, ибо чувствовала приятное расслабление от поучительных речей. Но Селифан никак не мог припомнить, два или три поворота проехал. Сообразив и припоминая несколько дорогу, он догадался, что много было поворотов, которые все пропустил он мимо. Так как русский человек в решительные минуты найдется, что сделать, не вдаваясь в дальние рассуждения, то, поворотивши направо, на первую перекрестную дорогу, прикрикнул он: «Эй вы, други почтенные!» — и пустился вскачь, мало помышляя о том, куда приведет взятая дорога.","Thinking thus, Selifan at last climbed into the most remote abstractions. If Chichikov had listened, he would have learned many details relating to him personally; but his thoughts were so occupied with his subject that only a strong clap of thunder made him wake up and look around him; the whole sky was completely overcast, and the dusty post road was sprinkled with raindrops. At last the thunderclap resounded another time, louder and nearer, and the rain suddenly gushed as if from a bucket. First, having taken an oblique direction, he whipped at one side of the body of the wagon, then at the other, then, changing the mode of attack and becoming completely straight, he drummed directly on the top of its body; spray finally began to reach him in the face. This made him draw back the leather curtains with two round windows, determined to view the road views, and order Selifan to go faster. Selifan, also interrupted in the very middle of his speech, realized that there was no need to linger, immediately pulled some rubbish from under the goat, put it on his sleeves, grabbed the reins in his hands and shouted at his troika, which she moved her feet a little, for she felt a pleasant relaxation from instructive speeches. But Selifan could not remember whether he had gone through two or three turns. Thinking and remembering the road somewhat, he guessed that there were many turns, which he all missed by. Since a Russian person in decisive moments will find something to do without going into distant arguments, then, turning to the right, onto the first crossroads, he shouted: “Hey you, respected friends!” - and set off at a gallop, thinking little about where the road taken would lead.","Reasoning in this way Selifan rose at last to the most abstract generalisations. If Tchitchikov had been listening, he would have learned many details relating to himself. But his thoughts were so engrossed with his pet idea that nothing but a loud clap of thunder made him rouse himself and look about him. The whole sky was completely covered with clouds and the dusty high-road was being sprinkled with drops of rain. Then there came a second clap of thunder louder and nearer and the rain spurted down in bucketfuls. At first falling in a slanting direction, it lashed on one side of the chaise, then on the other; then, changing its direction and coming down quite straight, it pattered on the roof of the carriage; and finally drops spurted straight into our hero’s face. This made him draw the leather curtains, with two little round windows in them to give a view of the road, and tell Selifan to drive faster. Selifan, interrupted in the middle of his talk, realised that it certainly would not do to dawdle, pulled out from under the box seat some ragged garment of grey cloth, put it on, snatched up the reins, and shouted at his horses, who were scarcely moving their legs, for they felt agreeably relaxed by his edifying admonitions. But Selifan could not remember whether he had passed two, or three, turnings. On reflecting and recalling the road, he surmised that he had passed many. As in critical moments a Russian always decides what to do without further reflection, he turned to the right at the next crossroad and, shouting, “Hey, honoured friends!” put his horses into a gallop without considering long where the road he had taken might lead them.","Thus soliloquising, he passed to more remote abstractions; until, had Chichikov been listening, he would have learnt a number of interesting details concerning himself. However, his thoughts were wholly occupied with his own subject, so much so that not until a loud clap of thunder awoke him from his reverie did he glance around him. The sky was completely covered with clouds, and the dusty turnpike beginning to be sprinkled with drops of rain. At length a second and a nearer and a louder peal resounded, and the rain descended as from a bucket. Falling slantwise, it beat upon one side of the basketwork of the tilt until the splashings began to spurt into his face, and he found himself forced to draw the curtains (fitted with circular openings through which to obtain a glimpse of the wayside view), and to shout to Selifan to quicken his pace. Upon that the coachman, interrupted in the middle of his harangue, bethought him that no time was to be lost; wherefore, extracting from under the box-seat a piece of old blanket, he covered over his sleeves, resumed the reins, and cheered on his threefold team (which, it may be said, had so completely succumbed to the influence of the pleasant lassitude induced by Selifan’s discourse that it had taken to scarcely placing one leg before the other). Unfortunately, Selifan could not clearly remember whether two turnings had been passed or three. Indeed, on collecting his faculties, and dimly recalling the lie of the road, he became filled with a shrewd suspicion that A VERY LARGE NUMBER of turnings had been passed. But since, at moments which call for a hasty decision, a Russian is quick to discover what may conceivably be the best course to take, our coachman put away from him all ulterior reasoning, and, turning to the right at the next cross-road, shouted, “Hi, my beauties!” and set off at a gallop. Never for a moment did he stop to think whither the road might lead him!","Reasoning thus, Selifan wound up finally in the most remote abstractions. If Chichikov had lent an ear to it, he would have learned many details relating to himself personally; but his thoughts were so occupied with his subject that only a loud clap of thunder made him come to himself and look around: the whole sky was completely covered with dark clouds, and the dusty post road was sprinkled with drops of rain. Finally a clap of thunder came louder and nearer, and it suddenly started pouring buckets. At first, assuming an oblique direction, the rain lashed against one side of the kibitka’s body, then against the other, then, changing its manner of attack and becoming completely straight, it drummed straight down on the top; splashes finally started flying as far as his face. This induced him to draw the leather curtains with their two round little windows, intended for the viewing of roadside scenes, and order Selifan to drive faster. Selifan, also interrupted in the middle of his speech, realized that he indeed should not dawdle, straightaway pulled some rag of gray flannel from under his seat, thrust his arms into the sleeves, seized the reins in his hands, and yelled to his troika, which had barely been moving its legs, for it felt agreeably relaxed as a result of his instructive speeches. But Selifan simply could not recall whether he had passed two or three turns. Thinking back and recalling the road somewhat, he realized that there had been many turns, all of which he had skipped. Since a Russian man in a critical moment finds what to do without going into further reasonings, he shouted, after turning right at the next crossroads: “ Hup, my honored friends!” and started off at a gallop, thinking little of where the road he had taken would lead him.","Discoursing thus, Selifan at last got off into the most remote abstractions. If Chichikov had lent an attentive ear, he would have learned many particulars referring to him personally; but his thoughts were so taken up with their main object that it was only a deafening thunderclap which forced him to come to himself and look about him : the whole sky was overcast with clouds, and the dusty post road had become spattered with drops of rain. Finally a thunderclap pealed a second time, louder and nearer by now, and the rain burst suddenly, as if from a bucket. At first, taking an oblique direction, it lashed one side of the carriage, then the other; next, changing its method of attack and becoming perfectly vertical, it drummed right on the carriage top; the drops, finally, began pelting the occupant’s face. This made him screen himself by pulling down two leather curtains with two round little windows, intended for the contemplation of the views along the road, and give orders to Selifan to drive faster. Selifan, who had also been interrupted in the very midst of his harangue, realizing that this was certainly no time to dally, immediately dragged out from under his box some sort of wretched garment of drab cloth, threw it over himself, grabbed the reins, and shouted to his troika, who were barely putting one foot in front of another, for they felt a pleasant enervation after the instructive discourses they had heard. But Selifan, no matter how hard he strove to do so, could not recall whether he had passed two turns in the road or three. Having considered, and recalling the road to some extent, he surmised that the turns had been many, all of which he had let slip by. Since a Russian will always promptly find a course of action at decisive moments, without going in for any remote considerations, Selifan consequently turned to the right at the first crossroad he came to, shouted to his horses: “Hey, there, my honored friends!” and started off at a gallop, giving but little thought to where the road he had taken might bring him."
"На это Плюшкин что-то пробормотал сквозь губы, ибо зубов не было, что именно, неизвестно, но, вероятно, смысл был таков: «А побрал бы тебя черт с твоим почтением!» Но так как гостеприимство у нас в таком ходу, что и скряга не в силах преступить его законов, то он прибавил тут же несколько внятнее: «Прошу покорнейше садиться!»","To this, Plyushkin muttered something through his lips, for there were no teeth, what exactly, it is not known, but, probably, the meaning was this: “And the devil would have taken you with your respect!” But since our hospitality is in such a way that even a miser is not able to transgress its laws, he immediately added somewhat more clearly: “I ask you to sit down most humbly!”","To this Plyushkin muttered something between his lips,—he had no teeth,—what it was exactly is not certain, but probably the gist of it was: “ The deuce take you and your respects”; but, as hospitality is so traditional a duty among us that even a miser cannot bring himself to transgress its laws, he added a little more distinctly: “Pray sit down!”","With toothless gums Plushkin murmured something in reply, but nothing is known as to its precise terms beyond that it included a statement that the devil was at liberty to fly away with Chichikov’s sentiments.

Зато, брат Чичиков, как покатили мы в первые дни! Правда, ярмарка была отличнейшая. Сами купцы говорят, что никогда не было такого съезда. У меня все, что ни привезли из деревни, продали по самой выгоднейшей цене. Эх, братец, как покутили! Теперь даже, как вспомнишь… черт возьми! то есть как жаль, что ты не был. Вообрази, что в трех верстах от города стоял драгунский полк. Веришь ли, что офицеры, сколько их ни было, сорок человек одних офицеров было в городе; как начали мы, братец, пить… Штабс-ротмистр Поцелуев… такой славный! усы, братец, такие! Бордо называет просто бурдашкой. «Принеси-ка, брат, говорит, бурдашки!» Поручик Кувшинников… Ах, братец, какой премилый человек! вот уж, можно сказать, во всей форме кутила. Мы все были с ним вместе. Какого вина отпустил нам Пономарев! Нужно тебе знать, что он мошенник и в его лавке ничего нельзя брать: в вино мешает всякую дрянь: сандал, жженую пробку и даже бузиной, подлец, затирает; но зато уж если вытащит из дальней комнатки, которая называется у него особенной, какую-нибудь бутылочку — ну просто, брат, находишься в эмпиреях. Шампанское у нас было такое — что пред ним губернаторское? просто квас. Вообрази, не клико, а какое-то клико-матрадура, это значит двойное клико. И еще достал одну бутылочку французского под названием: бонбон. Запах? — розетка и все что хочешь. Уж так покутили!.. После нас приехал какой-то князь, послал в лавку за шампанским, нет ни одной бутылки во всем городе, все офицеры выпили. Веришь ли, что я один в продолжение обеда выпил семнадцать бутылок шампанского!","— What an importance! - said Nostril, - that way I will beat him. No, try to play doublet, [7] so then I'll see, I'll see then what kind of player he is! But, brother Chichikov, how we rolled in the first days! Indeed, the fair was excellent. The merchants themselves say that there has never been such a congress. I have everything that was brought from the village, sold at the best price. Oh, brother, what a spree! Now, even when you remember... damn it! I mean, what a pity you weren't. Imagine that three versts from the city there was a regiment of dragoons. Do you believe that the officers, no matter how many there were, forty people of some officers were in the city; how we began to drink, brother... Captain-captain Kiss... so glorious! mustache, brother, such! He calls Bordeaux simply a burdashka. “Bring it, brother, he says, booties!” Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov... Ah, brother, what a lovely man! now, one might say, in all form a reveler. We were all with him. What wine did Ponomarev release us! You need to know that he is a swindler and you can’t take anything in his shop: all sorts of rubbish interferes with the wine: sandalwood, burnt cork and even elderberry, scoundrel, rubs; but on the other hand, if he pulls out some kind of bottle from a distant room, which he calls special, - well, simply, brother, you are in the empyrean. We had such champagne - what is the governor's before him? just kvass. Imagine, not a clique, but some kind of clique-matradura, that means double clique. And he also took out one bottle of French called: bonbon. Smell? - socket and whatever you want. We've had so much fun!.. Some prince came after us, sent to the shop for champagne, there wasn't a single bottle in the whole city, all the officers had drunk. Would you believe that I alone drank seventeen bottles of champagne in the course of dinner!","“As though that mattered,” said Nozdryov; “I shall beat him all the same. Just let him try playing doubles, then I shall see; I shall see then how much of a player he is. But what a roaring time we had the first days, friendTchitchikov. The fair really was a first-rate one. The very dealers said there had never been such a crowd. Everything I had brought from the village sold at tip-top prices. Ah, my boy, didn’t we have a time! Even now when one thinks of it ... dash it all! What a pity you weren’t there! Only fancy, there was a regiment of dragoons stationed only two miles from the town. Would you believe it, all the officers, forty of them, were in the town, every man-jack of them.... When we began to drink, my boy ... the staff-captain Potsyeluev ... such a jolly fellow ... such fine moustaches, my boy! He calls Bordeaux simply ‘bordashka.’ ‘Bring us some bordashka, waiter!’ he would say. Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov ... ah, my boy, what a charming man! One might say he is a regular dog! He and I were together all the time. What wine Ponomarey brought out for us! You must know he is a regular cheat; you shouldn’t buy anything in his shop; he puts all sorts of rubbish into his wine, sandalwood, burnt cork, and even colours it with elderberries, the rogue: but if he brings out from some remote place they call the special room, some choice little bottle, well then, old boy, you will find yourself in the empyrean.an We had champagne ... what was the governor’s compared with it?—no better than cider. Just fancy, not Cliquot but a special Cliquot-Matradura which means double Cliquot. And he got us a bottle of French wine too, called Bon-bon, with a fragrance!—of roses and anything you like! Didn’t we have a roaring time! A prince who came after us sent to the shop for champagne, there wasn’t a bottle to be had in the town: the officers had drunk it all. Would you believe it, I drank seventeen bottles of champagne myself at dinner!”","“Splendid of him! Nevertheless I will get my own back. Let him play me at doubles, and we shall soon see what sort of a player he is! Friend Chichikov, at first we had a glorious time, for the fair was a tremendous success. Indeed, the tradesmen said that never yet had there been such a gathering. I myself managed to sell everything from my estate at a good price. In fact, we had a magnificent time. I can’t help thinking of it, devil take me! But what a pity YOU were not there! Three versts from the town there is quartered a regiment of dragoons, and you would scarcely believe what a lot of officers it has. Forty at least there are, and they do a fine lot of knocking about the town and drinking. In particular, Staff-Captain Potsieluev is a SPLENDID fellow! You should just see his moustache! Why, he calls good claret ‘trash’! ‘ Bring me some of the usual trash,’ is his way of ordering it. And Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov, too! He is as delightful as the other man. In fact, I may say that every one of the lot is a rake. I spent my whole time with them, and you can imagine that Ponomarev, the wine merchant, did a fine trade indeed! All the same, he is a rascal, you know, and ought not to be dealt with, for he puts all sorts of rubbish into his liquor—Indian wood and burnt cork and elderberry juice, the villain! Nevertheless, get him to produce a bottle from what he calls his ‘special cellar,’ and you will fancy yourself in the seventh heaven of delight. And what quantities of champagne we drank! Compared with it, provincial stuff is kvass 18. Try to imagine not merely Clicquot, but a sort of blend of Clicquot and Matradura—Clicquot of double strength. Also Ponomarev produced a bottle of French stuff which he calls ‘Bonbon.’ Had it a bouquet, ask you? Why, it had the bouquet of a rose garden, of anything else you like. What times we had, to be sure! Just after we had left Pnomarev’s place, some prince or another arrived in the town, and sent out for some champagne; but not a bottle was there left, for the officers had drunk every one! Why, I myself got through seventeen bottles at a sitting.”","said Nozdryov. “I could beat him, too, that way! No, let him try doubling , then I’ll see, then I’ll see what kind of player he is! But still, brother Chichikov, how we caroused those first days! True, the fair was an excellent one. The merchants themselves said there had never been such a gathering. Everything we brought from my estate was sold at the most profitable price. Eh, brother, how we caroused! Even now, when I remember … devil take it! I mean, what a pity you weren’t there. Imagine, a dragoon regiment was stationed two miles from town. Would you believe it, the officers, all there were of them, forty men just of officers alone, came to town; and, brother, how we started drinking … Staff Captain Potseluev … what a nice one he is! a mustache, brother, like this! Bordeaux he calls simply brewdeaux. ‘ Bring us some of that brewdeaux, brother!’ he says. Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov … Ah, brother, what a sweetheart! Him, now, him we can call a carouser by all the rules. We were always together. What wine Ponomaryov brought out for us! You should know that he’s a crook and one oughtn’t to buy anything in his shop: he mixes all sorts of trash with his wine—sandalwood, burnt cork, he even rubs red elderberry into it, the scoundrel; but to make up for that, if he does go and fetch some bottle from his far-off little room, the special room, he calls it—well, brother, then you’re simply in the empyrean. We had such a champagne— what’s the governor’s next to that? mere kvass. Imagine, not clicquot, but some sort of clicquot-matradura, meaning double clicquot.10 And he also brought out one little bottle of a French wine called ‘bonbon.’ Bouquet?—rosebuds and whatever else you like. Oh, did we carouse! … After us some prince arrived, sent to a shop for champagne, there wasn’t a bottle left in the whole town, the officers drank it all. Would you believe it, I alone, in the course of one dinner, drank seventeen bottles of champagne!”","“He isn’t so great!” said Nozdrev. “If I were to pull some of his stunts, I could trim him too. Oh, no; just let him try to double, then I’ll see— I’ll see then what sort of a gambler he is! But then, brother Chichikov, what a high time we had during the first few days! The fair was certainly a most excellent one. The merchants themselves say that never before had so many people come together. Everything I had brought from the village was sold at a most advantageous price. Eh, dear brother, did we have ourselves a good time! Even now, when one thinks of it... the Devil take it! I mean, what a pity it is you weren’t there! Just imagine, there was a regiment of dragoons stationed a couple of miles from town. Well, would you believe it, all the officers—and there must have been at least forty of them—were in town, to a man. .. . When we started in to drink, brother dear.... Second Captain of Cavalry Potseluev, what a glorious fellow he was! What a mustache, brother dear! He never called Bordeaux anything but just bird-doo. ‘ Brother,’ he’d say to the waiter, ‘bring us some bird-doo, now!’ Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov... ah, brother, what an infinitely charming fellow!2 There, now, is what one would call a full-blown profligate! He and I went around together all the time. And what wines Pono-marev let us have! You must know he’s a great swindler, and you can’t get anything decent in his shop; he always mixes all sorts of rubbish into his wines—sandalwood, burnt cork, and, the scoundrel, he even fouls it with alderwood; but then, if he does at last drag some little bottle or other out of his furthest room, which is called the Special Room in his place, well, brother, then you simply float in the empyrean. The champagne we had was such that.. . well, what would the Governor’s be beside it? Why, nothing but ordinary kvas! Just imagine, it wasn’t Clicquot, but some sort of a Clicquot-Matradura; that means it’s double Clicquot. And he also got out a bottle of French wine, by the name of Bon-Bon. Bouquet? A posy of roses and everything else you wish. Oh, we sure did have ourselves a good time! Some prince or other who arrived in town after we did sent to Ponomarev’s shop for champagne—the officers had drunk it up, every last drop of it. Would you believe it, I alone drank up seventeen bottles of champagne at one dinner!”"

"Но в продолжение того, как он сидел в жестких своих креслах, тревожимый мыслями и бессонницей, угощая усердно Ноздрева и всю родню его, и перед ним теплилась сальная свечка, которой светильня давно уже накрылась нагоревшею черною шапкою, ежеминутно грозя погаснуть, и глядела ему в окна слепая, темная ночь, готовая посинеть от приближавшегося рассвета, и пересвистывались вдали отдаленные петухи, и в совершенно заснувшем городе, может быть, плелась где-нибудь фризовая шинель, горемыка неизвестно какого класса и чина, знающая одну только (увы!) слишком протертую русским забубенным народом дорогу, — в это время на другом конце города происходило событие, которое готовилось увеличить неприятность положения нашего героя. Именно, в отдаленных улицах и закоулках города дребезжал весьма странный экипаж, наводивший недоумение насчет своего названия. Он не был похож ни на тарантас, ни на коляску, ни на бричку, а был скорее похож на толстощекий выпуклый арбуз, поставленный на колеса. Щеки этого арбуза, то есть дверцы, носившие следы желтой краски, затворялись очень плохо по причине плохого состояния ручек и замков, кое-как связанных веревками. Арбуз был наполнен ситцевыми подушками в виде кисетов, валиков и просто подушек, напичкан мешками с хлебами, калачами, кокурками, скородумками и кренделями из заварного теста. Пирог-курник и пирог-рассольник выглядывали даже наверх. Запятки были заняты лицом лакейского происхожденья, в куртке из домашней пеструшки, с небритой бородою, подернутою легкой проседью, — лицо, известное под именем «малого». Шум и визг от железных скобок и ржавых винтов разбудили на другом конце города булочника, который, подняв свою алебарду, закричал спросонья что стало мочи: «Кто идет?» — но, увидев, что никто не шел, а слышалось только издали дребезжанье, поймал у себя на воротнике какого-то зверя и, подошед к фонарю, казнил его тут же у себя на ногте. После чего, отставивши алебарду, опять заснул по уставам своего рыцарства. Лошади то и дело падали на передние коленки, потому что не были подкованы, и притом, как видно, покойная городская мостовая была им мало знакома. Колымага, сделавши несколько поворотов из улицы в улицу, наконец поворотила в темный переулок мимо небольшой приходской церкви Николы на Недотычках и остановилась пред воротами дома протопопши. Из брички вылезла девка, с платком на голове, в телогрейке, и хватила обоими кулаками в ворота так сильно, хоть бы и мужчине (малый в куртке из пеструшки был уже потом стащен за ноги, ибо спал мертвецки). Собаки залаяли, и ворота, разинувшись наконец, проглотили, хотя с большим трудом, это неуклюжее дорожное произведение. Экипаж въехал в тесный двор, заваленный дровами, курятниками и всякими клетухами; из экипажа вылезла барыня: эта барыня была помещица, коллежская секретарша Коробочка. Старушка вскоре после отъезда нашего героя в такое пришла беспокойство насчет могущего произойти со стороны его обмана, что, не поспавши три ночи сряду, решилась ехать в город, несмотря на то что лошади не были подкованы, и там узнать наверно, почем ходят мертвые души и уж не промахнулась ли она, боже сохрани, продав их, может быть, втридешева. Какое произвело следствие это прибытие, читатель может узнать из одного разговора, который произошел между одними двумя дамами. Разговор сей… но пусть лучше сей разговор будет в следующей главе.","But as he sat in his hard armchair, troubled by thoughts and insomnia, diligently treating Nozdryov and all his relatives, a tallow candle flickered in front of him, with which the lamp had long been covered with a burning black hat, every minute threatening to go out, and looked into his blind, dark night, ready to turn blue from the approaching dawn, and distant roosters whistled in the distance, and in the completely asleep city, perhaps, somewhere a frieze overcoat was woven somewhere, a miserable man of unknown class and rank, who knows only one (alas!) too worn the road to the Russian people, beaten down by the people, - at that time, at the other end of the city, an event was taking place that was preparing to increase the unpleasantness of the position of our hero. Indeed, in the remote streets and back streets of the city, a very strange carriage rattled, suggesting bewilderment about its name. It did not look like a carriage, or a carriage, or a britzka, but rather looked like a fat-cheeked, convex watermelon set on wheels. The cheeks of this watermelon, that is, the doors, which bore traces of yellow paint, closed very poorly due to the poor condition of the handles and locks, somehow tied with ropes. The watermelon was filled with cotton pillows in the form of pouches, rolls and just pillows, stuffed with sacks of bread, rolls, kokurki, quick thinkers and pretzels made from custard dough. Pie-kurnik and pie-pickle even looked up. The back of the head was occupied by a person of lackey origin, in a jacket of homemade pied, with an unshaven beard covered with light gray, - a person known as the ""small one"". A noise and a screech from iron brackets and rusty screws woke up a baker at the other end of the city, who, raising his halberd, yelled in his waking breath: ""Who's coming?"" - but, seeing that no one was walking, and only a rattling was heard from afar, he caught some animal on his collar and, going up to the lantern, executed him right there on his fingernail. After that, putting aside the halberd, he again fell asleep according to the rules of his chivalry. The horses now and then fell on their front knees, because they were not shod, and, moreover, apparently, the late city pavement was little known to them. Kolymaga, after making several turns from street to street, finally turned into a dark lane past the small parish church of Nikola on Nedotychki and stopped in front of the gates of the archpriest's house. A girl climbed out of the britzka, with a scarf on her head, in a padded jacket, and with both fists hit the gate as hard as even a man (the guy in the pied jacket was later dragged off by the legs, for he slept like a dead man). The dogs barked, and the gates opened at last, swallowing, though with great difficulty, this clumsy work of the road. The crew drove into a cramped yard, littered with firewood, chicken coops and all sorts of sheds; a lady got out of the carriage: this lady was a landowner, collegiate secretary Korobochka. Soon after the departure of our hero, the old woman became so anxious about what might happen on the part of his deceit that, having not slept for three nights in a row, she decided to go to the city, despite the fact that the horses were not shod, and there to find out for sure how much dead souls go and maybe she missed, God forbid, by selling them, maybe at a bargain price. What effect this arrival produced, the reader may learn from a conversation which took place between two ladies alone. This conversation ... but let this conversation be in the next chapter.","But while our hero was sitting in his hard armchair, troubled by sleeplessness and his thoughts, and vigorously cursing Nozdryov and all his relations, while before him glowed a tallow candle with a black cowl of soot on the wick, which threatened every minute to go out, while the blind, dark night, on the point of turning blue with the approaching dawn, looked in at the window, and in the distance cocks were crowing to one another, and in the slumbering town perhaps some poor fellow of unknown class and rank in a fustianda overcoat trudged along knowing nothing of aught but the highway, too well worn (alas!) by the vagabonds of Russia—at that very moment an event was taking place at the other end of the town that was destined to increase the unpleasantness of our hero’s position. To be precise, a strange equipage, for which it is puzzling to find a name, was creaking through the further streets and alleys of the town; it was not like a coach, nor a carriage, nor a chaise, but it was more like a full-cheeked rounded melon on wheels. The cheeks of this melon, that is the doors, which bore tracks of yellow paint, shut very badly owing to the rickety condition of the handles and locks, which were tied up with string. The melon was full of cotton cushions in the shape of pouches, rolling-pins and simple pillows, stuffed up with sacks of bread, fancy loaves, doughnuts and pasties, and bread rings made of boiled dough. Chicken pies and saltfish pies peeped out at the top. The footboard was occupied by an individual of the flunkey order, with an unshaven chin, slightly touched with grey, in a short jacket of bright-coloured homespun—the sort of individual known as a “fellow.” The clank and squeaking of the iron clamps and rusty screws woke a sentry at the other end of the town, who picking up his halberd shouted half awake at the top of his voice: “Who goes there?” but seeing that no one was passing, and only hearing a creaking in the distance, caught a beast of some sort on his collar, and, going up to a lamp-post, executed it on the spot with his nail, then laying aside his halberd, fell asleep again in accordance with the rules of his chivalry. The horses kept falling on their knees, for they had not been shod, and evidently the quiet cobbled streets of the town were unfamiliar to them. This grotesque equipage, after turning several times from one street into another, at last turned into a dark side-street next the little parish church of St. Nikolay, and stopped before the head priest’s gate. A girl clambered out of the vehicle, wearing a short warm jacket, with a kerchief on her head, and beat on the gate with both fists as though she were beating a man (the “fellow” in the bright-coloured homespun jacket was afterwards dragged down by his legs, for he was sleeping like the dead). Dogs began barking, the gates yawned, and at last, though with difficulty, swallowed up this uncouth monster of the road. The carriage drove into the narrow yard which was filled up with stacks of wood, poultry-houses and sheds; a lady alighted: this lady was no other than Madame Korobotchka. Soon after our hero’s departure, the old lady had been overcome by such anxiety as to the possibility of his deceiving her, that after lying awake for three nights in succession she made up her mind to drive into the town, regardless of the fact that the horses were not shod, hoping there to find out for certain what price dead souls were going for, and whether she had not—God forbid—made a terrible blunder by selling them at a third of their proper price. The effect produced by this incident may be understood by the reader from a conversation which took place between two ladies. This conversation—but this conversation had better be kept for the following chapter.","In short, Nozdrev’s whole lineage was passed in review; and many of its members in the ascending line fared badly in the process. Meanwhile, at the other end of the town there was in progress an event which was destined to augment still further the unpleasantness of our hero’s position. That is to say, through the outlying streets and alleys of the town there was clattering a vehicle to which it would be difficult precisely to assign a name, seeing that, though it was of a species peculiar to itself, it most nearly resembled a large, rickety water melon on wheels. Eventually this monstrosity drew up at the gates of a house where the archpriest of one of the churches resided, and from its doors there leapt a damsel clad in a jerkin and wearing a scarf over her head. For a while she thumped the gates so vigorously as to set all the dogs barking; then the gates stiffly opened, and admitted this unwieldy phenomenon of the road. Lastly, the barinia herself alighted, and stood revealed as Madame Korobotchka, widow of a Collegiate Secretary! The reason of her sudden arrival was that she had felt so uneasy about the possible outcome of Chichikov’s whim, that during the three nights following his departure she had been unable to sleep a wink; whereafter, in spite of the fact that her horses were not shod, she had set off for the town, in order to learn at first hand how the dead souls were faring, and whether (which might God forfend!) she had not sold them at something like a third of their true value. The consequences of her venture the reader will learn from a conversation between two ladies. We will reserve it for the ensuing chapter.","But all the while he was sitting in his hard armchair, troubled by thoughts and sleeplessness, zealously giving what for to Nozdryov and all his kin, and the tallow candle glimmered before him, its wick long covered by a black cap of snuff, threatening to go out at any moment, and blind, dark night looked in his window, ready to turn blue with approaching dawn, and somewhere far away far-off roosters whistled to each other, and in a completely sleeping town, perhaps, a frieze greatcoat plodded along somewhere, a wretch of unknown class and rank, who knows (alas!) one path only, all too well beaten by the devil-may-care Russian people—during this time, at the other end of town, an event was taking place which was about to increase the unpleasantness of our hero’s situation. Namely, through the remote streets and alleys of the town there came clattering a rather strange vehicle, causing bewilderment with regard to its name. It resembled neither a tarantass, nor a barouche, nor a britzka, but more closely resembled a round, fat-cheeked watermelon on wheels. The cheeks of this watermelon—the doors, that is—bearing traces of yellow paint, closed very poorly on account of the poor condition of the handles and latches, which were tied anyhow with string. The watermelon was filled with cotton pillows shaped like pouches, bolsters, and simple pillows, and it was stuffed with sacks of bread, kalatchi,41 cheesecakes, filled dumplings, and doughnuts. A chicken pie and a mince pie even peeked from the top. The footboard was occupied by a person of lackey origin, in a jacket of homespun ticking, with an unshaved beard shot with gray—a person known by the name of “lad.” The noise and screeching of iron clamps and rusty bolts awakened a sentinel on the other side of town, who, raising his halberd, shouted, half awake, with all his might: “ Who goes there?”—but seeing no one going there, and hearing only a distant clatter, he caught some beast on his collar and, going up to the streetlamp, executed it then and there on his nail. After which, setting his halberd aside, he fell asleep again according to the rules of his knightly order. The horses kept falling on their knees, because they were not shod and, besides, evidently had little familiarity with the comforts of town cobblestones. The rattletrap made several turns from one street to another and finally turned onto a dark lane by the small parish church of St. Nicholas on Nedotychki42 and stopped by the gates of the archpriest’s wife’s house. A wench climbed out of the britzka in a quilted jacket, with a kerchief on her head, and banged on the gate with both fists as good as a man (the lad in the homespun jacket was later pulled down by his feet, for he was sleeping like the dead). The dogs barked and the gates, having gaped open, finally swallowed, though with great difficulty, this clumsy traveling contraption. The vehicle drove into a small yard cluttered with firewood, chicken coops, and all sorts of sheds; out of the vehicle climbed a lady: this lady was a landowner, the widow of a collegiate secretary, Korobochka. Soon after our hero’s departure, the old woman had become so worried with regard to the possible occurrence of deceit on his side that, after three sleepless nights in a row, she had resolved to go to town, even though the horses were not shod, and there find out for certain what was the going price for dead souls, and whether she had, God forbid, gone amiss, having perhaps sold them dirt cheap. What consequences this arrival produced, the reader may learn from a certain conversation that took place between a certain two ladies. This conversation … but better let this conversation take place in the next chapter.","But while Chichikov was sitting in his uneasy chair, troubled by his thoughts and sleeplessness, heartily reviling Nozdrev and all his kith and kin, and before him warmly glowed a tallow candle, the wick of which had long since become covered with candle snuff as if with a black cowl and was threatening to go out at any moment, and sightless, black night was peering in at the windows, just about to turn bluish because of the approaching dawn, and roosters, afar off, were exchanging their clarion calls, and throughout the town, all sunk in slumber, there may not have been a soul out on the streets save for some frieze overcoat tipsily weaving along somewhere, some poor wretch, his class and rank unknown, and himself knowing only (alas!) the path, all too deeply beaten and much trodden by the unruly, loose, hard-drinking Russian folk—at this time, in another quarter of the town, an event was taking place which was about to augment the unpleasantness of our hero’s position. To be precise, through the remote streets and by-lanes of the town a quite odd vehicle, which made one wonder what name one could give it, was jarringly lumbering along. It resembled neither a tarantass, nor a calash, nor a light covered carriage, but rather a round-cheeked, bulging watermelon placed on wheels. The cheeks of this watermelon—i.e., its small doors— which still bore traces of yellow paint, closed but poorly, owing to the sad state of the handles and catches, which were haphazardly tied together with bits of rope. The watermelon was filled to bursting with calico pillows shaped like tobacco pouches, like bolsters, or simply like pillows; it was stuffed with bags of bread loaves (plain and braided), egg buns, dumplings, and pretzels of biscuit dough. There was even a chicken pie and another of salted beef, both peeping coyly out of one of the bags. The footboard behind was occupied by a person of flunky extraction, in a short jacket of homespun striped ticking, his chin unshaven and his head slightly grizzled—a person usually described as a “lad.” The noise and whining from the iron clamps and rusty bolts awakened, at the other end of the town, a sentry in his box, who, picking up his halberd, set up a shout with all his might, though still half asleep: “Who goes there?” But, perceiving that no one was going there and that there was only a clatter of wheels in the distance, he contented himself with catching some beastie or other on his coat collar and, walking up to a street lamp, executing it summarily on his thumbnail, after which, putting his halberd away in a corner, he again fell asleep, according to all the canons of his order of knighthood. The horses were forever stumbling to their foreknees, since they were not shod and, in addition to that, had but little acquaintance with the restful paved road of the town. This antediluvian shandrydan, having made several turns from one street to another, finally turned into a dark by-lane near the small parish church of Nikola-Out-in-the-Sticks and stopped before the house of the Archpriests wife. A wench with a kerchief on her head and dressed in a warm, sleeveless jacket, crawled out of the vehicle and began pounding with her fists on the gate as hard as any man could have done (the lad in the short jacket of striped ticking was only later on dragged off his perch by his feet, inasmuch as he was sleeping the sleep of the dead). Dogs began barking, and the gates, gaping open at last, swallowed, though with difficulty, this cumbersome conveyance. It drove into a crowded yard, cluttered with firewood, henhouses, and all sorts of flimsy coops and hutches; a gentlewoman climbed out of the vehicle; this gentlewoman being none other than Korobochka the landowner, widow of a collegiate secretary. Soon after our hero’s departure the little crone had been overcome by such uneasiness about a possible raw deal on his part that, after losing sleep for three nights in a row, she had decided to go into town—despite the fact that her horses were not shod—and there learn for sure what dead souls were fetching and whether she hadn’t— God forbid!—missed a trick in selling them for what may have been next to nothing. What effect this arrival brought about the reader may learn from a certain conversation which took place between a certain two ladies. This conversation .. . but better let this conversation come in the next chapter."
"— А что брат, — говорил Ноздрев, прижавши бока колоды пальцами и несколько погнувши ее, так что треснула и отскочила бумажка. — Ну, для препровождения времени, держу триста рублей банку!","“What about brother,” said Nozdryov, pressing the sides of the pack with his fingers and bending it a little, so that the piece of paper cracked and bounced off. - Well, to pass the time, I keep three hundred rubles in a jar!","“Well, my boy,” said Nozdryov, pressing the side of the pack with his fingers and slightly bending it so that the paper round it split and flew off, “to pass the time I’ll put three hundred roubles in the bank.”","“I tell you what,” said Nozdrev, pressing the sides of the pack together, and then slightly bending them, so that the pack cracked and a card flew out. “How would it be if, to pass the time, I were to make a bank of three hundred?”","“And now, brother,” Nozdryov said, squeezing the sides of the pack with his fingers and bending it slightly, so that the wrapper cracked and popped off. “So, just to while away the time, I’ll put up a bank of three hundred roubles!”","“Well, what do you say, brother?” Nozdrev was saying, squeezing the sides of the deck with his fingers and buckling it a little, so that the band about it burst and flew off. “I’m starting the bank at three hundred— oh, just to pass the time away!”"
"— Не в том дело, дядюшка, — сказал племянник. — Мне не трудно попросить у него извиненья, тем более что я, точно, виноват. Он мне начальник, и мне ни в каком случае не следовало так говорить с ним. Но дело вот в чем: вы позабыли, что у меня есть другая служба; у меня триста душ крестьян, именье в расстройстве, а управляющий — дурак. Государству утраты немного, если вместо меня сядет в канцелярию другой переписывать бумагу, но большая утрата, если триста человек не заплатят податей. Я помещик: званье это также не бездельно. Если я позабочусь о сохраненье, сбереженье и улучшенье участи вверенных мне людей и представлю государству триста исправнейших, трезвых, работящих подданных — чем моя служба будет хуже службы какого-нибудь начальника отделения Леницына?","""That's not the point, uncle,"" said the nephew. “It’s not difficult for me to ask him for an apology, especially since I’m definitely to blame. He's my boss and I shouldn't have spoken to him like that. But here's the thing: you forgot that I have another service; I have three hundred souls of peasants, the estate is in disorder, and the manager is a fool. It is a small loss for the state if another one sits in the office instead of me to copy the paper, but a big loss if three hundred people do not pay taxes. I am a landowner: the title is also not idle. If I take care to preserve, save and improve the lot of the people entrusted to me and present to the state three hundred most efficient, sober, hard-working subjects - how will my service be worse than the service of some head of the department Leninsyn?","“That’s not the point, uncle,” said the nephew. “There’s no difficulty about my asking his pardon, especially as I really am to blame. He is my chief and I ought not in any case to have spoken to him as I did. But the real point is this: you have forgotten that I have other duties: I have three hundred peasants, my estate is in disorder and my steward’s a fool. It will be no great loss to the state if some one sits in my place copying papers, but it will be a great loss if three hundred men don’t pay their taxes. I am a landowner: there’s plenty to do in that position also. If I concern myself with the preservation, care and improvement of the people entrusted to me and present the state with three hundred sober, hardworking subjects, in what way will my work be inferior to that of some chief of a department like Lyenitsyn?”","“But, dear Uncle,” the nephew replied, “that is not the point. The point is, not that I should find an apology difficult to offer, seeing that, since Lienitsin is my superior, and I ought not to have addressed him as I did, I am clearly in the wrong. Rather, the point is the following. To my charge there has been committed the performance of another kind of service. That is to say, I am the owner of three hundred peasant souls, a badly administered estate, and a fool of a bailiff. That being so, whereas the State will lose little by having to fill my stool with another copyist, it will lose very much by causing three hundred peasant souls to fail in the payment of their taxes. As I say (how am I to put it?), I am a landowner who has preferred to enter the Public Service. Now, should I employ myself henceforth in conserving, restoring, and improving the fortunes of the souls whom God has entrusted to my care, and thereby provide the State with three hundred law-abiding, sober, hard-working taxpayers, how will that service of mine rank as inferior to the service of a department-directing fool like Lienitsin?”","“That’s not the point, dear uncle,” said the nephew. “It’s not hard for me to apologize, the more so as I am indeed to blame. He is my superior, and I should never have spoken to him in that way. But the point is this: you forget that I have a different service; I have three hundred peasant souls, my estate is in disorder, and the steward is a fool. It will be no great loss to the state if someone else sits in the office copying papers instead of me, but it will be a great loss if three hundred men don’t pay their taxes. I am a landowner: the title is not a worthless one. If I take care to preserve, protect, and improve the lot of the people entrusted to me, and present the state with three hundred fit, sober, and industrious subjects—will my service be in any way worse than the service of some department chief Lenitsyn?”",

"— Сам погубил себя, сам знаю — не умел вовремя остановиться. Но за что же такая страшная кара, Афанасий Васильевич? Я разве разбойник? От меня разве пострадал кто-нибудь? Разве я сделал кого несчастным? Трудом и потом, кровавым потом добывал копейку. Зачем добывал копейку? Затем, чтобы в довольстве прожить остаток дней, оставить что-нибудь детям, которых намеревался приобрести для блага, для службы отечеству. Покривил, не спорю, покривил… что ж делать? Но ведь покривил, увидя, что прямой дорогой не возьмешь и что косой дорогой больше напрямик. Но ведь я трудился, я изощрялся. А эти мерзавцы, которые по судам берут тысячи с казны иль небогатых людей грабят, последнюю копейку сдирают с того, у кого нет ничего!.. Афанасий Васильевич! Я не блудничал, я не пьянствовал. Да ведь сколько трудов, сколько железного терпенья! Да я, можно сказать, выкупил всякую добытую копейку страданьями, страданьями! Пусть их кто-нибудь выстрадает то, что я! Ведь что вся жизнь моя: лютая борьба, судно среди волн. И потеряно, Афанасий Васильевич, то, что приобретено такой борьбой…","- I ruined myself, I know myself - I did not know how to stop in time. But why such a terrible punishment, Afanasy Vasilyevich? Am I a robber? Did anyone get hurt by me? Have I made anyone unhappy? With labor and sweat, bloody sweat, I got a penny. Why did you get a penny? Then, in order to live the rest of the days in contentment, leave something for the children whom he intended to acquire for the good, for the service of the fatherland. Crooked, I do not argue, twisted ... what to do? But after all, he twisted, seeing that you couldn’t take the straight road and that the oblique road was more straight. But after all I worked, I refined myself. And these bastards, who take thousands from the treasury by courts or rob poor people, rip off the last penny from the one who has nothing! .. Afanasy Vasilyevich! I didn't fornicate, I didn't drink. Why, how much work, how much iron patience! Yes, I can say that I redeemed every penny I got with suffering, suffering! Let them someone suffer what I am! After all, what is my whole life: a fierce struggle, a ship among the waves. And lost, Afanasy Vasilyevich, is what is gained by such a struggle ...","“I have been my own ruin, I feel that I have been my own ruin. I could not stop in time. But what is such a fearful punishment for, Afanasy Vassilyevitch! Am I a robber? Have I made any one unhappy? By toil and sweat, by bloody sweat I have made my hard-earned kopecks. What have I made my money for? To live out the remnant of my days in comfort, to leave something to my wife and the children whom I had intended to have for the welfare, for the service of my country. I have not been straightforward, I admit it ... what could I do? for I saw that I could never get there by the straight road, and that the shortest way was by the crooked path. But I have toiled, I have exerted myself. While those blackguards who take thousands in the courts—and not as though it were from the government—they rob poor people of their last kopeck, they fleece those who have nothing! Afanasy Vassilyevitch , I have not been profligate, I’ve not been drunken.... And what toil, what iron endurance I have shown! Yes I have , I may say, paid for every kopeck I have gained by suffering, suffering! Let any one of them endure what I have! What, what has all my life been? A bitter struggle, a ship tossing in the waves. And all at once to be deprived of what I have earned, Afanasy Vassilyevitch, of what I have won by such struggles ...”","“Satan tempted me, and has ended by making of me an outcast from the human race!” Chichikov beat his head against the wall and struck the table with his fist until the blood spurted from his hand. Yet neither his head nor his hand seemed to be conscious of the least pain. “Calm yourself, Paul Ivanovitch,” said Murazov. “Calm yourself, and consider how best you can make your peace with God. Think of your miserable soul, and not of the judgment of man.” “I will, Athanasi Vassilievitch, I will. But what a fate is mine! Did ever such a fate befall a man? To think of all the patience with which I have gathered my kopecks, of all the toil and trouble which I have endured! Yet what I have done has not been done with the intention of robbing any one, nor of cheating the Treasury. Why, then, did I gather those kopecks? I gathered them to the end that one day I might be able to live in plenty, and also to have something to leave to the wife and children whom, for the benefit and welfare of my country, I hoped eventually to win and maintain. That was why I gathered those kopecks. True, I worked by devious methods—that I fully admit; but what else could I do? And even devious methods I employed only when I saw that the straight road would not serve my purpose so well as a crooked. Moreover, as I toiled, the appetite for those methods grew upon me. Yet what I took I took only from the rich; whereas villains exist who, while drawing thousands a year from the Treasury, despoil the poor, and take from the man with nothing even that which he has. Is it not the cruelty of fate, therefore, that, just when I was beginning to reap the harvest of my toil—to touch it, so to speak, with the tip of one finger—there should have arisen a sudden storm which has sent my barque to pieces on a rock? My capital had nearly reached the sum of three hundred thousand roubles, and a three-storied house was as good as mine, and twice over I could have bought a country estate. Why, then, should such a tempest have burst upon me? Why should I have sustained such a blow? Was not my life already like a barque tossed to and fro by the billows? Where is Heaven’s justice—where is the reward for all my patience, for my boundless perseverance? Three times did I have to begin life afresh, and each time that I lost my all I began with a single kopeck at a moment when other men would have given themselves up to despair and drink. How much did I not have to overcome. How much did I not have to bear! Every kopeck which I gained I had to make with my whole strength; for though, to others, wealth may come easily, every coin of mine had to be ‘forged with a nail worth three kopecks’ as the proverb has it. With such a nail—with the nail of an iron, unwearying perseverance—did I forge my kopecks.”","“I have been my own ruin, I know it—I did not know how to stop in time. But why such a terrible punishment, Afanasy Vassilyevich? Am I a robber? Has anyone suffered from me? Have I made anyone unhappy? By toil and sweat, by sweating blood, I procured my kopeck. Why did I procure this kopeck? In order to live out the rest of my days in comfort, to leave something to my children, whom I intended to acquire for the good, for the service of the fatherland. I erred , I don’t deny it, I erred … what to do? But I erred because I saw that I’d get nowhere on the straight path, and that to go crookedly was straighter. But I toiled, I strained. And these scoundrels who sit in the courts taking thousands from the treasury or robbing people who aren’t rich, filching the last kopeck from those who have nothing … Afanasy Vassilyevich! I did not fornicate, I did not drink. And so much work, so much iron patience! Yes, it could be said that every kopeck I procured was redeemed with sufferings, sufferings! Let one of them suffer as I did! What has my whole life been: a bitter struggle, a ship amidst the waves. And, Afanasy Vassilyevich, I have lost what was acquired with such struggle …”",

Why not a thrashing, if it’s deserved? That’s what you are master for. There must be thrashing, for the peasants are too fond of their ease; order must be kept up. If it’s deserved, then thrash, why not thrash?”","“As you please, barin,” replied the complacent Selifan. “Should you whip me, you will whip me, and I shall have nothing to complain of. Why should you not whip me if I deserve it? ‘ Tis for you to do as you like. Whippings are necessary sometimes, for a peasant often plays the fool, and discipline ought to be maintained. If I have deserved it, beat me. Why should you not?”","“As ever your grace pleases,” replied the all-agreeable Selifan, “if it’s a whipping, it’s a whipping; I don’t mind about that at all. Why not a whipping, if it’s deserved, that’s the master’s will. Whipping’s needed, because a muzhik goes a-frolicking, there’s need for order. If it’s deserved, give him a whipping: why not give him a whipping?”","“Just as Your Grace wishes,” answered Selifan, who was ready to agree to everything. “If I’ve got to be flogged, then let me be flogged; I’m not at all against it. Why not be flogged, if one deserves it? That is as the master wills. Flogging, now, is a needful thing, for otherwise the muzhik would get spoiled; order must be maintained. If one deserves it, then go ahead with the flogging—why not?”"

"— Приятное столкновение, — сказал голос того же самого, который окружил его поясницу. Это был Вишнепокромов. — Готовился было пройти лавку без вниманья, вдруг вижу знакомое лицо — как отказаться от приятного удовольствия! Нечего сказать, сукна в этом году несравненно лучше. Ведь это стыд, срам! Я никак не мог было отыскать… Я готов тридцать рублей, сорок рублей… возьми пятьдесят даже, но дай хорошего. По мне, или иметь вещь, которая бы, точно, была уже отличнейшая, или уж лучше вовсе не иметь. Не так ли?","""Nice encounter,"" said the voice of the same one that circled his lower back. It was Vishnepokromov. - I was getting ready to pass the shop without attention, suddenly I see a familiar face - how to refuse a pleasant pleasure! Needless to say, the cloth this year is incomparably better. It's a shame, a shame! I couldn’t find it in any way ... I’m ready for thirty rubles, forty rubles ... even take fifty, but give me a good one. For me, either to have a thing that, for sure, would already be excellent, or it’s better not to have it at all. Is not it?","“An agreeable encounter,” said the voice of the person whose arm was round his waist. It was Vishnepokromov. “I was just going to pass the shop without noticing, when suddenly I saw a familiar face—I couldn’t deny myself the pleasure! There is no doubt that the cloth is ever so much better this year. It used to be a shame, a disgrace! I never could find anything decent.... I am ready to pay forty roubles, fifty even, but give me something good.... What I think is: either have a thing that really is the best, or else have nothing at all. Isn’t that right?”","“Excellent, but not what I want,” pronounced Chichikov. “Formerly I was in the Custom’s Department, and therefore wear none but cloth of the latest make. What I want is of a ruddier pattern than this—not exactly a bottle-tinted pattern, but something approaching bilberry.” “I understand, sir. Of course you require only the very newest thing. A cloth of that kind I DO possess, sir, and though excessive in price, it is of a quality to match.”","“A pleasant encounter,” said the voice of the same man who had encircled his waist. It was Vishnepokromov. “I was prepared to pass by the shop without paying any attention, when suddenly I saw a familiar face—how can one deny oneself an agreeable pleasure! There’s no denying the fabrics are incomparably better this year. It’s a shame and a disgrace! I simply couldn’t find … Thirty roubles, forty roubles I’m prepared to … ask even fifty, but give me something good. I say either one has something that is really of the most excellent quality, or it’s better not to have it at all. Right?”",

"— Да, был бы ты без ружья, как без шапки. Эх, брат Чичиков, то есть как я жалел, что тебя не было Я знаю, что ты бы не расстался с поручиком Кувшинниковым. Уж как бы вы с ним хорошо сошлись! Это не то что прокурор и все губернские скряги в нашем городе, которые так и трясутся за каждую копейку. Этот, братец, и в гальбик, и в банчишку, и во все что хочешь. Эх, Чичиков, ну что бы тебе стоило приехать? Право, свинтус ты за это, скотовод эдакой! Поцелуй меня, душа, смерть люблю тебя! Мижуев, смотри, вот судьба свела: ну что он мне или я ему? Он приехал бог знает откуда, я тоже здесь живу… А сколько было, брат, карет, и все это en gros.[8] В фортунку[9] крутнул: выиграл две банки помады, фарфоровую чашку и гитару; потом опять поставил один раз и прокрутил, канальство, еще сверх шесть целковых. А какой, если б ты знал, волокита Кувшинников! Мы с ним были на всех почти балах. Одна была такая разодетая, рюши на ней, и трюши, и черт знает чего не было… я думаю себе только: «черт возьми!» А Кувшинников, то есть это такая бестия, подсел к ней и на французском языке подпускает ей такие комплименты… Поверишь ли, простых баб не пропустил. Это он называет: попользоваться насчет клубнички. Рыб и балыков навезли чудных. Я таки привез с собою один; хорошо, что догадался купить, когда были еще деньги. Ты куда теперь едешь?","- Yes, if you were without a gun, it would be like without a hat. Oh, brother Chichikov, that is, how I regretted that you were not there. I know that you would not part with Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov. How well you would get along with him! This is not like the prosecutor and all the provincial misers in our city, who are shaking for every penny. This one, brother, is in galbik, and in a jar, and in whatever you want. Eh, Chichikov, why should you come? Really, you're a pig for this, a kind of cattle breeder! Kiss me, soul, death love you! Mizhuev, look, fate brought together: what is he to me or me to him? He came from God knows where, I also live here ... And how many carriages, brother, and all this en gros.[8] I played fortune [9]: I won two cans of lipstick, a china cup and a guitar; then again he set it once and scrolled, channel, more than six rubles. And what, if you knew, red tape Kuvshinnikov! We were with him at almost all the balls. One was so dressed up, ruffles on her, and ruffles, and the devil knows what was not there ... I only think to myself: “Damn it!” And Kuvshinnikov, that is, this is such a beast, sat down next to her and in French allowed her such compliments ... Believe me, he didn’t miss ordinary women. That's what he calls: take advantage of the strawberries. Wonderful fish and balyks were brought in. I did bring one with me; It's good that I guessed to buy when there was still money. Where are you going now?","“Yes, you would lose your gun if you did, as you lost your cap. Oh, friend Tchitchikov, how sorry I was you weren’t there! I know that you would never have parted from Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov, how he and you would have got on together!

Oh, Tchitchikov, you might just as well have come! You really were a pig not to, you cattle-breeder! Kiss me, my dear soul, I like you awfully! Just fancy, Mizhuev, here fate has brought us together! Why, what was he to me or I to him? He has come here God knows where from and I, too, am living here.... And what lots of carriages there were, old boy, and it was all en gros.ao I tried my luck and won two pots of po matum, a china cup and a guitar; and then I staked once more and lost more than six roubles, damn it all. And what a flirt that Kuvshinnikov is if you only knew! We went with him to almost all the balls. There was one girl dressed up to the nines, all frills and flounces, and the deuce knows what. I thought to myself: ‘Dash it all!’ But Kuvshinnikov, he is a devil of a fellow, sat down beside her and let off such compliments in French.... Would you believe it, he wouldn’t let the peasant women alone either. That’s what he calls ‘gathering roses while we may. ’ap There were wonderful fish and dried sturgeon for sale; I did bring one away with me, it’s a good thing I thought to buy it while I had the money left. Where are you off to now?”","“It is as well for you that you don’t, since, otherwise, you would have found yourself minus both gun and cap. However, friend Chichikov, it is a pity you were not there. Had you been there, I feel sure you would have found yourself unable to part with Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov. You and he would have hit it off splendidly. You know, he is quite a different sort from the Public Prosecutor and our other provincial skinflints—fellows who shiver in their shoes before they will spend a single kopeck.

I like you immensely. Mizhuev, see how curiously things have turned out. Chichikov has nothing to do with me, or I with him, yet here is he come from God knows where, and landed in the very spot where I happen to be living! I may tell you that, no matter how many carriages I possessed, I should gamble the lot away. Recently I went in for a turn at billiards, and lost two jars of pomade, a china teapot, and a guitar. Then I staked some more things, and, like a fool, lost them all, and six roubles in addition. What a dog is that Kuvshinnikov! He and I attended nearly every ball in the place. In particular, there was a woman—decolletee, and such a swell! I merely thought to myself, ‘The devil take her!’ but Kuvshinnikov is such a wag that he sat down beside her, and began paying her strings of compliments in French. However, I did not neglect the damsels altogether—although HE calls that sort of thing ‘going in for strawberries.’ By the way, I have a splendid piece of fish and some caviare with me. ‘ Tis all I HAVE brought back! In fact it is a lucky chance that I happened to buy the stuff before my money was gone. Where are you for?”","“Right, you’d be without a gun, just as you’re without a hat. Eh, brother Chichikov, I mean, how sorry I was that you weren’t there. I know you’d never part from Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov. How well you’d get along together! A far cry from the prosecutor and all the provincial skinflints in our town, who tremble over every kopeck. That one, brother, will sit down to quinze, or faro, or anything you like. Eh, Chichikov, would it have cost you so much to come? Really, aren’t you a little pig after that, you cattle breeder! Kiss me, dear heart, on my life I do love you! Mizhuev, look how fate has brought us together: what is he to me or I to him? He came from God knows where, and I also live here … And there were so many carriages, brother, and all that en gros. I spun the wheel of fortune: won two jars of pomade, a porcelain cup, and a guitar; then I staked again, spun it, and lost, confound it, six roubles on top of that. And what a philanderer Kuvshinnikov is, if you only knew! He and I went to nearly all the balls. There was one girl there so decked out, all ruche and truche and devil knows what not … I just thought to myself: ‘Devil take it!’ But Kuvshinnikov, I mean, he’s such a rascal, he sat himself down next to her and started getting at her with all these compliments in the French language … Would you believe it, he didn’t pass by the simple wenches either. That’s what he calls ‘going straw-berrying.’ And the abundance of wonderful fish and balyks!11 I brought one with me; it’s a good thing I thought of buying it while I still had money. Where are you going now?”","“Why, you’d be shy a gun just as sure as you’re standing there. Eh, brother Chichikov, I can’t tell you how sorry I felt you weren’t there. I know that you and Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov would have become inseparable. How well you’d have gotten along together! This isn’t the same thing as the Public Prosecutor and all the provincial skinflints in our town, who simply shiver in their boots over every copper. This fellow, brother, will go for faro or banker, and for anything and everything you like. Eh, Chichikov, how would it have put you out to come? Really, you’re a swine not to have done it, you cattle breeder, you! Kiss me, my soul, I’m terribly fond of you! Look, Mizhuev, fate itself has brought us together! There, now, what is he to me, or I to him? He has come God knows whence, and I happen to be just a fellow living hereabouts.... And how many carriages there were, brother, and all that en gros, on a grand scale. I had a whirl at the roulette wheel, too, and won two jars of pomade, a porcelain cup, and a guitar; then I had one more go and, deuce take it, lost everything and six silver rubles on top of that. And if you but knew what a man Kuvshinnikov is for a petticoat! He and I were at almost all the balls. There was one fair creature at one of them dressed to kill, all frills and furbelows, and the Devil alone knows what else she didn’t have on.... All I do is to think to myself: cMay the Devil take me!’ But Kuvshinnikov, now, what a scoundrel he is! He sits down near her and starts dishing out compliments to her in French, and what compliments! ...

Ну, послушайте: ну, вот я вам на суд… — Тут Костанжогло подвинулся ближе к Чичикову и, чтобы заставить его получше вникнуть в дело, взял его на абордаж, другими словами — засунул палец в петлю его фрака. — Ну, что может быть яснее? У тебя крестьяне затем, чтобы ты им покровительствовал в их крестьянском быту. В чем же быт? в чем же занятия крестьянина? В хлебопашестве? Так старайся, чтобы он был хорошим хлебопашцем. Ясно?

Что сами благодаря этой роскоши стали тряпки, а не люди, и болезней черт знает каких понабрались, и уж нет осьмнадцатилетнего мальчишки, который бы не испробовал всего: и зубов у него нет, и плешив, — так хотят теперь и этих заразить. Да слава богу, что у нас осталось хотя одно еще здоровое сословие, которое не познакомилось с этими прихотями! За это мы просто должны благодарить бога. Да, хлебопашцы для меня всех почтеннее.

Yes, you look under your feet, and do not look at the offspring; take care to make the peasant sufficient and rich, and so that he has time to study according to his own desire, and not just say with a stick in his hand: “Learn!” The devil knows where they start from! .. Well, listen: well, here I am for you to judge ... - Here Costanjoglo moved closer to Chichikov and, in order to get him to better understand the matter, took him on board, in other words - stuck his finger in the loop of his tailcoat. Well, what could be clearer? You have peasants so that you patronize them in their peasant life. What is life? what is the occupation of the peasant? In arable farming? So try to make him a good farmer. It's clear? No, there were smart people, they say: “He needs to be brought out of this state. He leads a too rough, simple life: you need to introduce him to luxury goods. That, thanks to this luxury, they themselves became rags, and not people, and the devil knows what diseases they picked up, and there is no longer an eighteen-year-old boy who has not tried everything: he has no teeth and is bald - so now they want to infect these too. Yes, thank God that we still have at least one healthy class left that has not become acquainted with these whims! For that we just have to thank God. Yes, the cultivators are the most respected for me. God forbid that all were cultivators!","“Oh, brother, do you at least be sensible; what do you want with that posterity? Every one seems to think that he is Peter the Great. But you look at what’s under your feet, and don’t gaze away at posterity ; work to make the peasant competent and well off, and to let him have leisure to study as he likes instead of saying to him, stick in hand: ‘Learn!’ They begin at the wrong end! ... Here, listen; come, I ask you to judge....” At this point Skudronzhoglo moved closer to Tchitchikov, and to make him attend more closely to the matter, took possession of him, or, in other words, put his finger through the buttonhole of his coat. “Come, what could be clearer. You have peasants in order that you may protect them in their peasant existence. And what does it consist of? What is the peasant’s occupation? Growing corn. So you must try and make him a good husbandman. Is that clear? There are wiseacres who say: ‘We can raise him out of that condition. He leads too coarse and simple an existence. We must make him acquainted with objects of luxury.’ It is not enough for them that through this luxury they have themselves become rags instead of men, and the devil only knows what diseases they have contracted from it, and now there is not a wretched boy of eighteen who hasn’t tried everything and has lost all his teeth and is bald,—and so now they want to infect the peasants too. But thank God we have one healthy class left which hasn’t got to know these vices. For that we ought simply to thank God. Yes, the man who tills the land is to my mind more worthy of honour than any. God grant that we may all be tillers of the land.”","Yes, no sooner does a man get a little education into his head than he becomes a Don Quixote, and establishes schools on his estate such as even a madman would never have dreamed of. And from that school there issues a workman who is good for nothing, whether in the country or in the town—a fellow who drinks and is for ever standing on his dignity. Yet still our landowners keep taking to philanthropy, to converting themselves into philanthropic knights-errant, and spending millions upon senseless hospitals and institutions, and so ruining themselves and turning their families adrift. Yes, that is all that comes of philanthropy.” Chichikov’s business had nothing to do with the spread of enlightenment, he was but seeking an opportunity to inquire further concerning the putting of refuse to lucrative uses; but Kostanzhoglo would not let him get a word in edgeways, so irresistibly did the flow of sarcastic comment pour from the speaker’s lips. “Yes,” went on Kostanzhoglo, “folk are always scheming to educate the peasant. But first make him well-off and a good farmer. THEN he will educate himself fast enough. As things are now, the world has grown stupid to a degree that passes belief. Look at the stuff our present-day scribblers write! Let any sort of a book be published, and at once you will see every one making a rush for it. Similarly will you find folk saying: ‘The peasant leads an over-simple life. He ought to be familiarised with luxuries, and so led to yearn for things above his station.’ And the result of such luxuries will be that the peasant will become a rag rather than a man, and suffer from the devil only knows what diseases, until there will remain in the land not a boy of eighteen who will not have experienced the whole gamut of them, and found himself left with not a tooth in his jaws or a hair on his pate. Yes, that is what will come of infecting the peasant with such rubbish. But, thank God, there is still one healthy class left to us—a class which has never taken up with the ‘advantages’ of which I speak. For that we ought to be grateful. And since, even yet, the Russian agriculturist remains the most respect-worthy man in the land, why should he be touched? Would to God every one were an agriculturist!”","“But you at least be intelligent, brother! What do you care about this posterity? Everyone thinks he’s some kind of Peter the Great! Look under your feet, don’t gaze into posterity; make it so that the muzhik is well off, even rich, so that he has time to study of his own will, but don’t take a stick in your hand and say: ‘Study!’ Devil knows which end they start from! … Listen, now, I’ll let you be the judge now …” Here Kostanzhoglo moved closer to Chichikov and, to give him a better grasp of the matter, boarded him with a grapnel—in other words, put a finger in the buttonhole of his tailcoat. “Now, what could be clearer? You have peasants, so you should foster them in their peasant way of life. What is this way of life? What is the peasant’s occupation? Ploughing? Then see to it that he’s a good ploughman. Clear? No, clever fellows turn up who say: ‘He should be taken out of this condition. The life he leads is too crude and simple: he must be made acquainted with the objects of luxury.’ They themselves, owing to this luxury, have become rags instead of people, and got infested with devil knows what diseases, and there’s no lad of eighteen left who hasn’t already tried everything : he’s toothless and bald behind —so now they want to infect these others with it all. Thank God we have at least this one healthy stratum left, as yet unacquainted with such whimsies! We must simply be grateful to God for that. Yes, for me the ploughmen are worthiest of all. God grant that all become ploughmen!”",

"«Эк его неугомонный бес как обуял!» — подумал про себя Чичиков и решился во что бы то ни стало отделаться от всяких бричек, шарманок и всех возможных собак, несмотря на непостижимую уму бочковатость ребр и комкость лап.","“Oh, how his restless demon seized him!” thought Chichikov to himself, and resolved to get rid of all sorts of britzkas, hurdy-gurdies, and all possible dogs at all costs, despite the incomprehensible barrel-shaped ribs and lumpy paws.","“Ough, the devil is egging him on! ” Tchitchikov thought to himself, and he made up his mind that, come what might, he would refuse all chaises, barrel-organs, and any conceivable dog in spite of ribs, barrel-shaped beyond all conception, and paws so soft and supple.","“The ramping, incorrigible devil!” thought Chichikov to himself as at all hazards he resolved to escape from britchkas, organs, and every species of dog, however marvellously barrel-ribbed and tucked up of paw.","“Eh, what a restless demon’s got into him!” Chichikov thought to himself, and resolved to be rid at whatever cost of every sort of britzka, barrel organ, and all possible dogs, despite any inconceivable-to-the-mind barrel shape of ribs or ball-likeness of paws.","“Eh, some fiend that won’t be stifled must have gotten into him!” Chichikov thought to himself and decided, no matter what happened, to get out of acquiring any light carriages, hurdy-gurdies, and all dogs of any sort whatsoever, despite the barrel-like formation of their ribs, beyond the powers of the mind to grasp, and the padlike formation of their paws."
"Старуха задумалась.

She saw that the transaction certainly seemed a profitable one, only it was too novel and unusual, and so she began to be extremely uneasy that the purchaser might be trying to cheat her.","However, the old lady still communed with herself.

"О себе приезжий, как казалось, избегал много говорить; если же говорил, то какими-то общими местами, с заметною скромностию, и разговор его в таких случаях принимал несколько книжные обороты: что он незначащий червь мира сего и не достоин того, чтобы много о нем заботились, что испытал много на веку своем, претерпел на службе за правду, имел много неприятелей, покушавшихся даже на жизнь его, и что теперь, желая успокоиться, ищет избрать наконец место для жительства, и что, прибывши в этот город, почел за непременный долг засвидетельствовать свое почтение первым его сановникам. Вот все, что узнали в городе об этом новом лице, которое очень скоро не преминуло показать себя на губернаторской вечеринке. Приготовление к этой вечеринке заняло с лишком два часа времени, и здесь в приезжем оказалась такая внимательность к туалету, какой даже не везде видывано. После небольшого послеобеденного сна он приказал подать умыться и чрезвычайно долго тер мылом обе щеки, подперши их извнутри языком; потом, взявши с плеча трактирного слуги полотенце, вытер им со всех сторон полное свое лицо, начав из-за ушей и фыркнув прежде раза два в самое лицо трактирного слуги. Потом надел перед зеркалом манишку, выщипнул вылезшие из носу два волоска и непосредственно за тем очутился во фраке брусничного цвета с искрой. Таким образом одевшись, покатился он в собственном экипаже по бесконечно широким улицам, озаренным тощим освещением из кое-где мелькавших океан. Впрочем, губернаторский дом был так освещен, хоть бы и для бала; коляска с фонарями, перед подъездом два жандарма, форейторские крики вдали — словом, всё как нужно. Вошедши в зал, Чичиков должен был на минуту зажмурить глаза, потому что блеск от свечей, ламп и дамских платьев был страшный. Все было залито светом. Черные фраки мелькали и носились врознь и кучами там и там, как носятся мухи на белом сияющем рафинаде в пору жаркого июльского лета, когда старая ключница рубит и делит его на сверкающие обломки перед открытым окном; дети все глядят, собравшись вокруг, следя любопытно за движениями жестких рук ее, подымающих молот, а воздушные эскадроны мух, поднятые легким воздухом, влетают смело, как полные хозяева, и, пользуясь подслеповатостию старухи и солнцем, беспокоящим глаза ее, обсыпают лакомые куски где вразбитную, где густыми кучами. Насыщенные богатым летом, и без того на всяком шагу расставляющим лакомые блюда, они влетели вовсе не с тем, чтобы есть, но чтобы только показать себя, пройтись взад и вперед по сахарной куче, потереть одна о другую задние или передние ножки, или почесать ими у себя под крылышками, или, протянувши обе передние лапки, потереть ими у себя над головою, повернуться и опять улететь, и опять прилететь с новыми докучными эскадронами. Не успел Чичиков осмотреться, как уже был схвачен под руку губернатором, который представил его тут же губернаторше. Приезжий гость и тут не уронил себя: он сказал какой-то комплимент, весьма приличный для человека средних лет, имеющего чин не слишком большой и не слишком малый. Когда установившиеся пары танцующих притиснули всех к стене, он, заложивши руки назад, глядел на них минуты две очень внимательно. Многие дамы были хорошо одеты и по моде, другие оделись во что бог послал в губернский город. Мужчины здесь, как и везде, были двух родов: одни тоненькие, которые всё увивались около дам; некоторые из них были такого рода, что с трудом можно было отличить их от петербургских, имели так же весьма обдуманно и со вкусом зачесанные бакенбарды или просто благовидные, весьма гладко выбритые овалы лиц, так же небрежно подседали к дамам, так же говорили по-французски и смешили дам так же, как и в Петербурге. Другой род мужчин составляли толстые или такие же, как Чичиков, то есть не так чтобы слишком толстые, однако ж и не тонкие. Эти, напротив того, косились и пятились от дам и посматривали только по сторонам, не расставлял ли где губернаторский слуга зеленого стола для виста. Лица у них были полные и круглые, на иных даже были бородавки, кое-кто был и рябоват, волос они на голове не носили ни хохлами, ни буклями, ни на манер «черт меня побери», как говорят французы, — волосы у них были или низко подстрижены, или прилизаны, а черты лица больше закругленные и крепкие. Это были почетные чиновники в городе. Увы! толстые умеют лучше на этом свете обделывать дела свои, нежели тоненькие. Тоненькие служат больше по особенным поручениям или только числятся и виляют туда и сюда; их существование как-то слишком легко, воздушно и совсем ненадежно. Толстые же никогда не занимают косвенных мест, а все прямые, и уж если сядут где, то сядут надежно и крепко, так что скорей место затрещит и угнется под ними, а уж они не слетят. Наружного блеска они не любят; на них фрак не так ловко скроен, как у тоненьких, зато в шкатулках благодать божия. У тоненького в три года не остается ни одной души, не заложенной в ломбард; у толстого спокойно, глядь — и явился где-нибудь в конце города дом, купленный на имя жены, потом в другом конце другой дом, потом близ города деревенька, потом и село со всеми угодьями. Наконец толстый, послуживши богу и государю, заслуживши всеобщее уважение, оставляет службу, перебирается и делается помещиком, славным русским барином, хлебосолом, и живет, и хорошо живет. А после него опять тоненькие наследники спускают, по русскому обычаю, на курьерских все отцовское добро. Нельзя утаить, что почти такого рода размышления занимали Чичикова в то время, когда он рассматривал общество, и следствием этого было то, что он наконец присоединился к толстым, где встретил почти все знакомые лица: прокурора с весьма черными густыми бровями и несколько подмигивавшим левым глазом так, как будто бы говорил: «Пойдем, брат, в другую комнату, там я тебе что-то скажу», — человека, впрочем, серьезного и молчаливого; почтмейстера, низенького человека, но остряка и философа; председателя палаты, весьма рассудительного и любезного человека, — которые все приветствовали его, как старинного знакомого, на что Чичиков раскланивался несколько набок, впрочем, не без приятности. Тут же познакомился он с весьма обходительным и учтивым помещиком Маниловым и несколько неуклюжим на взгляд Собакевичем, который с первого раза ему наступил на ногу, сказавши: «Прошу прощения». Тут же ему всунули карту на вист, которую он принял с таким же вежливым поклоном. Они сели за зеленый стол и не вставали уже до ужина. Все разговоры совершенно прекратились, как случается всегда, когда наконец предаются занятию дельному. Хотя почтмейстер был очень речист, но и тот, взявши в руки карты, тот же час выразил на лице своем мыслящую физиономию, покрыл нижнею губою верхнюю и сохранил такое положение во все время игры. Выходя с фигуры, он ударял по столу крепко рукою, приговаривая, если была дама: «Пошла, старая попадья!», если же король: «Пошел, тамбовский мужик!» А председатель приговаривал: «А я его по усам! А я ее по усам!» Иногда при ударе карт по столу вырывались выражения: «А! была не была, не с чего, так с бубен!» Или же просто восклицания: «черви! червоточина! пикенция!» или: «пикендрас! пичурущух! пичура!» и даже просто: «пичук!» — названия, которыми перекрестили они масти в своем обществе. По окончании игры спорили, как водится, довольно громко. Приезжий наш гость также спорил, но как-то чрезвычайно искусно, так что все видели, что он спорил, а между тем приятно спорил. Никогда он не говорил: «вы пошли», но: «вы изволили пойти», «я имел честь покрыть вашу двойку» и тому подобное. Чтобы еще более согласить в чем-нибудь своих противников, он всякий раз подносил им всем свою серебряную с финифтью табакерку, на дне которой заметили две фиалки, положенные туда для запаха. Внимание приезжего особенно заняли помещики Манилов и Собакевич, о которых было упомянуто выше. Он тотчас же осведомился о них, отозвавши тут же несколько в сторону председателя и почтмейстера. Несколько вопросов, им сделанных, показали в госте не только любознательность, но и основательность; ибо прежде всего расспросил он, сколько у каждого из них душ крестьян и в каком положении находятся их имения, а потом уже осведомился, как имя и отчество. В немного времени он совершенно успел очаровать их. Помещик Манилов, еще вовсе человек не пожилой, имевший глаза сладкие, как сахар, и щуривший их всякий раз, когда смеялся, был от него без памяти. Он очень долго жал ему руку и просил убедительно сделать ему честь своим приездом в деревню, к которой, по его словам, было только пятнадцать верст от городской заставы. На что Чичиков с весьма вежливым наклонением головы и искренним пожатием руки отвечал, что он не только с большою охотою готов это исполнить, но даже почтет за священнейший долг. Собакевич тоже сказал несколько лаконически: «И ко мне прошу», — шаркнувши ногою, обутою в сапог такого исполинского размера, которому вряд ли где можно найти отвечающую ногу, особливо в нынешнее время, когда и на Руси начинают выводиться богатыри.","The visitor, it seemed, avoided talking much about himself; if he spoke, then in some general places, with noticeable modesty, and his conversation in such cases took on somewhat bookish turns: that he was an insignificant worm of this world and did not deserve to be taken care of a lot, that he experienced a lot in his lifetime, suffered in the service for the truth, had many enemies who even made attempts on his life, and that now, wanting to calm down, he is finally looking for a place to live, and that, having arrived in this city, he considered it an indispensable duty to testify his respect to its first dignitaries. Here is everything that the city learned about this new face, who very soon did not fail to show himself at the governor's party. The preparation for this party took more than two hours, and here the visitor showed such attentiveness to the toilet, which is not even seen anywhere. After a short afternoon nap, he ordered to wash and rubbed both cheeks with soap for an extremely long time, propping them up from the inside with his tongue; then, taking a towel from the tavern servant's shoulder, he wiped his plump face from all sides with it, starting from behind his ears and snorting, first of all, a couple of times in the very face of the tavern servant. Then he put on his shirt-front in front of the mirror, plucked out two hairs that had come out of his nose, and immediately after that found himself in a lingonberry-colored tailcoat with a spark. Thus dressed, he rolled in his own carriage along the endlessly wide streets, illuminated by the skinny illumination from the ocean that flickered here and there. However, the governor's house was so lit up, even for a ball; a carriage with lanterns, two gendarmes in front of the entrance, postillion cries in the distance - in a word, everything is as it should be. On entering the hall, Chichikov had to shut his eyes for a minute, because the glare from the candles, lamps, and ladies' dresses was terrible. Everything was filled with light. Black tailcoats flashed and rushed apart and in heaps here and there, like flies on a white shining refined sugar during the hot July summer, when the old housekeeper cuts and divides it into sparkling fragments in front of an open window; the children all stare, gathered around, following with curiosity the movements of her hard hands, raising the hammer, and the aerial squadrons of flies, lifted by the light air, fly in boldly, like complete masters, and, taking advantage of the old woman's short-sightedness and the sun that disturbs her eyes, sprinkle tidbits where smashed, where in thick heaps. Saturated with a rich summer, already laying out delicious dishes at every step, they flew in not at all to eat, but only to show themselves, to walk up and down the sugar heap, to rub their hind or front legs against one another, or to scratch them. under your wings, or, stretching out both front paws, rub them over your head, turn around and fly away again, and fly back again with new tiresome squadrons. Before Chichikov had time to look around, he was already grabbed by the arm of the governor, who immediately introduced him to the governor's wife. The visiting guest did not drop himself here either: he said some kind of compliment, very decent for a middle-aged man who has a rank that is not too high and not too small. When the established pairs of dancers pressed everyone against the wall, he, laying his hands behind him, looked at them for about two minutes very carefully. Many ladies were well dressed and fashionable, others dressed in what God sent to the provincial town. The men here, as elsewhere, were of two kinds: some thin, who kept hovering around the ladies; some of them were of such a kind that it was difficult to distinguish them from St. and they made the ladies laugh just like in St. Petersburg. Another kind of men were fat or the same as Chichikov, that is, not so fat, but not thin either. These, on the contrary, squinted and backed away from the ladies and looked only around to see if the governor's servant had set up a green table for whist somewhere. Their faces were full and round, some even had warts, some were pockmarked, they did not wear hair on their heads either in tufts or curls, nor in the manner of ""damn it to me"", as the French say - their hair were either cut short or sleek, and the features were more rounded and strong. These were honorary officials in the city. Alas! fat people know how to handle their affairs better in this world than thin ones. The thin ones serve more on special assignments or are only registered and wag hither and thither; their existence is somehow too easy, airy and completely unreliable. Fat people never occupy indirect places, but all direct ones, and if they sit somewhere, they will sit securely and firmly, so that the place will soon crackle and bend under them, and they won’t fly off. They do not like external brilliance; on them the tailcoat is not so cleverly tailored as on thin ones, but in the caskets there is the grace of God. At the age of three, a thin man does not have a single soul left that is not pawned in a pawnshop; the fat one was calm, lo and behold - and somewhere at the end of the city a house bought in the name of his wife appeared, then another house at the other end, then a village near the city, then a village with all the land. Finally, the fat one, having served God and the sovereign, having earned universal respect, leaves the service, moves over and becomes a landowner, a glorious Russian master, a hospitable man, and lives, and lives well. And after him, again, the thin heirs lower, according to Russian custom, all their father's goods on courier. It cannot be concealed that almost this kind of reflection occupied Chichikov at the time when he was considering society, and the consequence of this was that he finally joined the fat ones, where he met almost all familiar faces: a prosecutor with very black thick eyebrows and a somewhat winking left eye as if he were saying: “Let's go, brother, to another room, there I will tell you something,” a man, however, serious and silent; the postmaster, a short man, but a wit and a philosopher; chairman of the chamber, a very sensible and amiable person, who all greeted him as if he were an old acquaintance, to which Chichikov bowed somewhat sideways, however, not without pleasantness. Immediately he met the very courteous and courteous landowner Manilov and the somewhat clumsy-looking Sobakevich, who stepped on his foot the first time, saying: ""I beg your pardon."" Immediately he was given a whist card, which he accepted with the same polite bow. They sat down at the green table and did not get up until supper. All conversations ceased completely, as always happens when one finally indulges in a sensible occupation. Although the postmaster was very eloquent, he, having taken the cards in his hands, immediately expressed a thinking physiognomy on his face, covered his upper lip with his lower lip and maintained this position throughout the game. Leaving the figure, he struck the table firmly with his hand, saying, if there was a lady: “Go, old priest!”, If the king: “Go, Tambov peasant!” And the chairman would say: “And I’m on his mustache! And I'm on her mustache! Sometimes, when the cards hit the table, expressions came out: “Ah! was not, not from what, so with a tambourine! Or just exclamations: “worms! worm-hole! picnic! or: “pickendras! pichurushchuh! pichura! and even simply: “pichuk!” - the names with which they crossed the suits in their society. At the end of the game they argued, as usual, rather loudly. Our visiting guest also argued, but somehow extremely skillfully, so that everyone saw that he was arguing, but meanwhile he was arguing pleasantly. He never said: “you went”, but: “you deigned to go”, “I had the honor to cover your deuce”, and the like. In order to further agree on something with his opponents, he each time offered them all his silver snuffbox with enamel, at the bottom of which they noticed two violets, put there for smell. The visitor's attention was especially occupied by the landowners Manilov and Sobakevich, whom we mentioned above. He immediately inquired about them, immediately recalling a few in the direction of the chairman and postmaster. Several questions made by him showed in the guest not only curiosity, but also thoroughness; for first of all he asked how many souls of peasants each of them had and in what condition their estates were, and then he inquired as to the name and patronymic. In a little while, he had completely charmed them. The landowner Manilov, not yet at all an elderly man, who had eyes as sweet as sugar, and screwed them up every time he laughed, was beyond memory of him. He shook his hand for a very long time and asked him convincingly to do him the honor of his arrival in the village, to which, according to him, was only fifteen miles from the city outpost. To which Chichikov, with a very polite inclination of his head and a sincere shake of the hand, replied that he was not only ready to do it with great pleasure, but even honored it as a sacred duty. Sobakevich also said somewhat succinctly: “And I ask you,” shuffling his foot, shod in a boot of such a gigantic size, which it is hardly possible to find a responding foot anywhere, especially at the present time, when heroes are beginning to appear in Russia.","The new-comer, as it seemed, avoided saying much about himself; if he did speak of himself it was in generalities, with conspicuous modesty, and his speech on such occasions took somewhat a bookish turn, such as: that he was only an insignificant worm, and did not deserve to be the object of attention, that he had passed through many experiences in his time, had suffered for the cause of justice, had many enemies who had even attempted his life, and that now, desirous of living in peace, he was looking out to find a place for his permanent residence and that being in the town he thought it his bounden duty to show his respect for its leading dignitaries. That was all that was learned in the town about this new personage who very shortly afterwards did not fail to put in an appearance at the governor’s evening-party. The preparations for this evening-party occupied him over two hours, and on this occasion he exhibited a greater attention to his toilet than is commonly seen. After a brief after-dinner nap he asked for soap and water and spent an extremely long time scrubbing his cheeks with soap, putting his tongue into them to make them stand out; then, taking a towel off the shoulder of the waiter, wiped his face in all directions, beginning from behind his ears, first giving two snorts right in the face of the waiter; then he put on his shirt-front before the looking-glass, tweaked out two hairs that were protruding from his nose, and immediately after that attired himself in a short cranberry-coloured dress coat. Having thus arrayed himself he drove in his own carriage through the immensely wide streets, illuminated by the faint light that came from the windows glimmering here and there. The governor’s house, however, was illuminated as though for a ball; there were carriages with lamps, two mounted policemen before the entrance, shouting postillions in the distance—in fact everything as it should be. On entering the room Tchitchikov had for a moment to screw up his eyes, for the glare of the candles, the lamps, and the ladies’ dresses was terrific. It was all flooded with light. Black coats flitted about, one by one or in groups, here and there, like flies flitting about a sparkling sugar-loaf on a hot July day when the old housekeeper breaks and splits it up into glistening lumps before the open window: the children all look on, gathered round her, watching with interest her rough hands lifting the hammer while airy squadrons of flies, floating on the breeze, fly in boldly as though the house belonged to them and, taking advantage of the old woman’s dim sight and the sunshine that dazzles her eyes, cover the dainty morsels, here in scattered groups, and there in dense crowds. Sated by the wealth of summer which spreads dainties for them at every step, they fly in, not for food but to display themselves, to parade up and down over the heap of sugar, to rub their hind legs or their front legs one against the other, or to scratch themselves under their wings, or stretching out both front legs to brush their heads with them, to turn and fly out again and to fly in once more in new persistent squadrons. Tchitchikov had hardly time to look about him when the governor took him by the arm and at once presented him to his wife. The new-comer did not lose his head, but paid her some compliments extremely suitable for a man of his age, who is of a rank in the service neither exalted nor very humble. When the couples of dancers taking their places pressed every one back to the wall, he gazed at them very attentively for two or three minutes with his hands behind him. Many of the ladies were well and fashionably dressed. Others were dressed in whatever Providence was pleased to send them in a provincial town. The men here as everywhere were of two kinds; first, the thin who were always hanging about the ladies; some of them could hardly be distinguished from Peters burgers:p they had the same elaborately and tastefully combed whiskers and the same pleasing, smoothly shaven, oval faces, they seated themselves beside the ladies in the same casual way, spoke French and diverted the ladies just like gentlemen from Petersburg. The second class consisted of the stout or those like Tchitchikov, who, though not extremely stout, were certainly not thin. These, on the contrary, looked askance at the ladies and held aloof from them, while they gazed about to see whether the governor’s servants had yet set the table for whist.q Their faces were round and full, some of them even had warts, some of them even were pock-marked; they did not wear their hair either in a top-knot or in curls, nor d la diable m‘emporter as the French call it; their hair was either cropped short or plastered to their heads, and their features inclined rather to the round and solid. These were the more dignified officials of the town. Alas! the stout know better how to manage their affairs in this world than the thin. The thin serve rather on special commissions or are mere supernumeraries, sent here and there. Their existence is somehow too light and airy and not to be depended upon. The stout never go by by-paths but always keep to the main road, and if they seat themselves anywhere they sit firmly and reliably, so that their seat is more likely to give way under them than they are to be dislodged from it. They are not fond of external display. Their coats are not so smartly cut as the thin man’s; their wardrobe is better stocked however. The thin man will in three years’ time not have a single serf left unmortgaged: while if you take a quiet look round, the fat man has a house at the end of the town bought in the name of his wife; later on, at the other end of the town, another one, then a little village near the town, then an estate with all the conveniences. In the end the fat man, after serving God and his Tsar and winning universal respect, leaves the service, moves away and becomes a landowner, a hearty hospitable Russian gentleman,—he gets on, and indeed gets on very well. And when he has gone, his thin heirs in accordance with the Russian tradition make ducks and drakess of all their father’s property. I cannot disguise the fact that such were the reflections which occupied Tchitchikov’s mind while he was scrutinising the company and the result was that he finally joined the fat ones, among whom he found all the personages he knew: the public prosecutor with very black thick eyebrows and with the left eye given to winking slightly as though to say: “Come into the next room, my boy, I have something to tell you,” though he was a serious and taciturn man; the postmaster, a short man who was a wit and a philosopher; the president of the court, a very sagacious and polite man,—all of whom welcomed him as an old acquaintance while Tchitchikov responded to their civilities by profuse bows a little to one side but no less agreeable for that. Then he made the acquaintance of a very civil and affable landowner called Manilov, and another, somewhat clumsy-looking, called Sobakevitch who to begin with trod on his foot, saying, “I beg your pardon.” Then they thrust upon him a card for whist, which he accepted with the same polite bow. They sat down to a green table and did not get up before supper. All conversation ceased entirely, as is always the case when people give themselves up to an important occupation. Though the postmaster was a very talkative person, yet as soon as he took up his cards his face at once became expressive of thought, while his upper lip was drawn down over the lower one and remained so all the time he was playing. When he played a court card, he would strike the table violently with his hand, saying if it were a queen, “Away with you, old priest’s wife,“ if it were a king, ”Away with you, Tambovt peasant! “—while the president would say, ” I’ll pull his whiskers, I’ll pull her whiskers! “ Sometimes as cards were slapped down on the table, comments burst out, ”Ah, come what may! there’s nothing else, so play a diamond! “ or the suits were called by various endearing nicknames with which they had rechristened them. At the end of the game they disputed rather loudly, as is usual. Our hero disputed, but so extremely skilfully, that every one could see that though he was arguing, he was arguing agreeably. He never said, ”You led,“ but ”You were pleased to lead; I had the honour to cover your two,“ and so on. To propitiate his opponents still further he invariably offered them his silver enamelled snuff-box, at the bottom of which they noticed two violets put there for the sake of the scent. The new-comer’s attention was particularly engaged by Manilov and Sobakevitch, the landowners above mentioned. He immediately drew the president and the postmaster a little aside and made inquiries concerning them. Several of the questions put by him showed not only a love of knowledge but also solid sense in the visitor, for he first of all inquired how many souls of peasants each of them possessed and in what condition their estates were, and only afterwards inquired their Christian name and father’s name. Before long he had succeeded in completely fascinating them. Manilov, a man who had hardly reached middle-age, with eyes as sweet as sugar which he screwed up every time he laughed, was enchanted with him. He pressed his hand very warmly and begged him earnestly to do him the honour of a visit to his country place which in his words was only ten miles from the town gate; to which Tchitchikov, with a very polite inclination of the head and cordial pressure of the hand, replied that he was not only extremely eager to do so, but would positively regard it as a sacred duty. Sobakevitch too said somewhat laconically, ” And I invite you too,“ with a scrape of his foot, shod in a boot of such gigantic proportions that it would be hard to find a foot to fit it, particularly nowadays when even in Russia giants are beginning to die out.","Of himself, however, the traveller had spoken little; or, if he had spoken at any length, he had done so in a general sort of way and with marked modesty. Indeed, at moments of the kind his discourse had assumed something of a literary vein, in that invariably he had stated that, being a worm of no account in the world, he was deserving of no consideration at the hands of his fellows; that in his time he had undergone many strange experiences; that subsequently he had suffered much in the cause of Truth; that he had many enemies seeking his life; and that, being desirous of rest, he was now engaged in searching for a spot wherein to dwell—wherefore, having stumbled upon the town in which he now found himself, he had considered it his bounden duty to evince his respect for the chief authorities of the place. This, and no more, was all that, for the moment, the town succeeded in learning about the new arrival. Naturally he lost no time in presenting himself at the Governor’s evening party. First, however, his preparations for that function occupied a space of over two hours, and necessitated an attention to his toilet of a kind not commonly seen. That is to say, after a brief post-prandial nap he called for soap and water, and spent a considerable period in the task of scrubbing his cheeks (which, for the purpose, he supported from within with his tongue) and then of drying his full, round face, from the ears downwards, with a towel which he took from the waiter’s shoulder. Twice he snorted into the waiter’s countenance as he did this, and then he posted himself in front of the mirror, donned a false shirt-front, plucked out a couple of hairs which were protruding from his nose, and appeared vested in a frockcoat of bilberry-coloured check. Thereafter driving through broad streets sparsely lighted with lanterns, he arrived at the Governor’s residence to find it illuminated as for a ball. Barouches with gleaming lamps, a couple of gendarmes posted before the doors, a babel of postillions’ cries—nothing of a kind likely to be impressive was wanting; and, on reaching the salon, the visitor actually found himself obliged to close his eyes for a moment, so strong was the mingled sheen of lamps, candles, and feminine apparel. Everything seemed suffused with light, and everywhere, flitting and flashing, were to be seen black coats—even as on a hot summer’s day flies revolve around a sugar loaf while the old housekeeper is cutting it into cubes before the open window, and the children of the house crowd around her to watch the movements of her rugged hands as those members ply the smoking pestle; and airy squadrons of flies, borne on the breeze, enter boldly, as though free of the house, and, taking advantage of the fact that the glare of the sunshine is troubling the old lady’s sight, disperse themselves over broken and unbroken fragments alike, even though the lethargy induced by the opulence of summer and the rich shower of dainties to be encountered at every step has induced them to enter less for the purpose of eating than for that of showing themselves in public, of parading up and down the sugar loaf, of rubbing both their hindquarters and their fore against one another, of cleaning their bodies under the wings, of extending their forelegs over their heads and grooming themselves, and of flying out of the window again to return with other predatory squadrons. Indeed, so dazed was Chichikov that scarcely did he realise that the Governor was taking him by the arm and presenting him to his (the Governor’s) lady. Yet the newly-arrived guest kept his head sufficiently to contrive to murmur some such compliment as might fittingly come from a middle-aged individual of a rank neither excessively high nor excessively low. Next, when couples had been formed for dancing and the remainder of the company found itself pressed back against the walls, Chichikov folded his arms, and carefully scrutinised the dancers. Some of the ladies were dressed well and in the fashion, while the remainder were clad in such garments as God usually bestows upon a provincial town. Also here, as elsewhere, the men belonged to two separate and distinct categories; one of which comprised slender individuals who, flitting around the ladies, were scarcely to be distinguished from denizens of the metropolis, so carefully, so artistically, groomed were their whiskers, so presentable their oval, clean-shaven faces, so easy the manner of their dancing attendance upon their womenfolk, so glib their French conversation as they quizzed their female companions. As for the other category, it comprised individuals who, stout, or of the same build as Chichikov (that is to say, neither very portly nor very lean), backed and sidled away from the ladies, and kept peering hither and thither to see whether the Governor’s footmen had set out green tables for whist. Their features were full and plump, some of them had beards, and in no case was their hair curled or waved or arranged in what the French call “the devil-may-care” style. On the contrary, their heads were either close-cropped or brushed very smooth, and their faces were round and firm. This category represented the more respectable officials of the town. In passing, I may say that in business matters fat men always prove superior to their leaner brethren; which is probably the reason why the latter are mostly to be found in the Political Police, or acting as mere ciphers whose existence is a purely hopeless, airy, trivial one. Again, stout individuals never take a back seat, but always a front one, and, wheresoever it be, they sit firmly, and with confidence, and decline to budge even though the seat crack and bend with their weight. For comeliness of exterior they care not a rap, and therefore a dress coat sits less easily on their figures than is the case with figures of leaner individuals. Yet invariably fat men amass the greater wealth. In three years’ time a thin man will not have a single serf whom he has left unpledged; whereas —well, pray look at a fat man’s fortunes, and what will you see? First of all a suburban villa, and then a larger suburban villa, and then a villa close to a town, and lastly a country estate which comprises every amenity! That is to say, having served both God and the State, the stout individual has won universal respect, and will end by retiring from business, reordering his mode of life, and becoming a Russian landowner—in other words, a fine gentleman who dispenses hospitality, lives in comfort and luxury, and is destined to leave his property to heirs who are purposing to squander the same on foreign travel. That the foregoing represents pretty much the gist of Chichikov’s reflections as he stood watching the company I will not attempt to deny. And of those reflections the upshot was that he decided to join himself to the stouter section of the guests, among whom he had already recognised several familiar faces—namely, those of the Public Prosecutor (a man with beetling brows over eyes which seemed to be saying with a wink, “Come into the next room , my friend, for I have something to say to you”—though, in the main, their owner was a man of grave and taciturn habit), of the Postmaster (an insignificant-looking individual, yet a would-be wit and a philosopher), and of the President of the Local Council (a man of much amiability and good sense). These three personages greeted Chichikov as an old acquaintance, and to their salutations he responded with a sidelong, yet a sufficiently civil, bow. Also, he became acquainted with an extremely unctuous and approachable landowner named Manilov, and with a landowner of more uncouth exterior named Sobakevitch—the latter of whom began the acquaintance by treading heavily upon Chichikov’s toes, and then begging his pardon. Next, Chichikov received an offer of a “cut in” at whist, and accepted the same with his usual courteous inclination of the head. Seating themselves at a green table, the party did not rise therefrom till supper time; and during that period all conversation between the players became hushed, as is the custom when men have given themselves up to a really serious pursuit. Even the Postmaster—a talkative man by nature—had no sooner taken the cards into his hands than he assumed an expression of profound thought, pursed his lips, and retained this attitude unchanged throughout the game. Only when playing a court card was it his custom to strike the table with his fist, and to exclaim (if the card happened to be a queen), “Now, old popadia 7!” and (if the card happened to be a king), “Now, peasant of Tambov!” To which ejaculations invariably the President of the Local Council retorted, “Ah, I have him by the ears, I have him by the ears!” And from the neighbourhood of the table other strong ejaculations relative to the play would arise, interposed with one or another of those nicknames which participants in a game are apt to apply to members of the various suits. I need hardly add that, the game over, the players fell to quarrelling, and that in the dispute our friend joined, though so artfully as to let every one see that, in spite of the fact that he was wrangling, he was doing so only in the most amicable fashion possible. Never did he say outright, “You played the wrong card at such and such a point.” No, he always employed some such phrase as, “You permitted yourself to make a slip, and thus afforded me the honour of covering your deuce.” Indeed, the better to keep in accord with his antagonists, he kept offering them his silver-enamelled snuff-box (at the bottom of which lay a couple of violets, placed there for the sake of their scent). In particular did the newcomer pay attention to landowners Manilov and Sobakevitch; so much so that his haste to arrive on good terms with them led to his leaving the President and the Postmaster rather in the shade. At the same time, certain questions which he put to those two landowners evinced not only curiosity, but also a certain amount of sound intelligence; for he began by asking how many peasant souls each of them possessed, and how their affairs happened at present to be situated, and then proceeded to enlighten himself also as their standing and their families. Indeed, it was not long before he had succeeded in fairly enchanting his new friends. In particular did Manilov—a man still in his prime, and possessed of a pair of eyes which, sweet as sugar, blinked whenever he laughed—find himself unable to make enough of his enchanter. Clasping Chichikov long and fervently by the hand, he besought him to do him, Manilov, the honour of visiting his country house (which he declared to lie at a distance of not more than fifteen versts from the boundaries of the town); and in return Chichikov averred (with an exceedingly affable bow and a most sincere handshake) that he was prepared not only to fulfil his friend’s behest, but also to look upon the fulfilling of it as a sacred duty. In the same way Sobakevitch said to him laconically: “And do you pay ME a visit,” and then proceeded to shuffle a pair of boots of such dimensions that to find a pair to correspond with them would have been indeed difficult—more especially at the present day, when the race of epic heroes is beginning to die out in Russia.","The newcomer, as it seemed, avoided talking much about himself; if he did talk, it was in some sort of commonplaces, with marked modesty, and his conversation on these occasions assumed a somewhat bookish manner: that he was an insignificant worm of this world and not worthy of much concern, that he had gone through many trials in his life, had suffered for the truth in the civil service, had many enemies, who had even made attempts on his life, and that now, wishing to be at peace, he was seeking to choose finally a place to live, and that, having arrived in this town, he considered it his bounden duty to offer his respects to its foremost dignitaries. This was all they learned in the town about this new person, who very shortly did not fail to make his appearance at the governor’s party. The preparations for this party took him more than two hours, and here the newcomer displayed an attention to his toilet such as has not even been seen everywhere. After a short after-dinner nap, he ordered himself a washing and spent an extremely long time rubbing his two cheeks with soap, propping them from inside with his tongue; then, taking the towel from the tavern servant’s shoulder, he wiped his plump face with it on all sides, starting behind the ears, and first snorting a couple of times right into the tavern servant’s face. Then he put on a shirtfront before the mirror, plucked out two hairs that protruded from his nose, and immediately afterwards found himself in a cranberry-colored tailcoat with flecks. Dressed thus, he rolled in his own carriage along the endlessly wide streets, lit by the scant glow of windows now and then flitting by. However, the governor’s house was lit up fit for a ball; carriages with lanterns, two gendarmes at the entrance, postillions shouting from afar—in short, everything as it should be. Entering the great hall, Chichikov had to squint his eyes for a moment, because the brilliance of the candles, the lamps, and the ladies’ gowns was terrible. Everything was flooded with light. Black tailcoats flitted and darted about separately and in clusters here and there, as flies dart about a gleaming white sugar loaf in the hot summertime of July, while the old housekeeper hacks it up and divides it into glistening fragments before the open window; the children all gather round watching, following curiously the movements of her stiff arms raising the hammer, and the airborne squadrons of flies, lifted by the light air, fly in boldly, like full masters, and, profiting from the old woman’s weak sight and the sunshine which troubles her eyes, bestrew the dainty morsels, here scatteredly, there in thick clusters. Satiated by summer’s bounty, which anyhow offers dainty dishes at every step, they fly in not at all in order to eat, but only in order to show themselves off, to stroll back and forth on the heap of sugar, to rub their back or front legs together, or to scratch themselves under the wings, or, stretching out both front legs, to rub them over their heads, then turn and fly away, to come back again in new, pestering squadrons. Before Chichikov had time to look around, the governor seized him under the elbow and at once introduced him to his wife. The new-come guest did not let himself down here either: he uttered some compliment most fitting for a middle-aged man of a rank neither too low nor too high. When the dancers paired off, pressing everyone to the wall, he stood with his hands behind his back watching them for about two minutes very attentively. Many of the ladies were dressed well and fashionably, others were dressed in whatever God sends to a provincial town. The men here, as everywhere else, were of two kinds: there were the slim ones, who kept mincing around the ladies; some of these were of a kind difficult to distinguish from Petersburgers, having side-whiskers brushed in as well-considered and tasteful a manner, or else simply decent, quite clean-shaven faces, sitting down as casually beside the ladies, speaking French and making the ladies laugh in the same way as in Petersburg. The other kind of men consisted of the fat ones, or those like Chichikov—that is, not all that fat, and yet not thin either. These, contrariwise, looked askance at the ladies and backed away from them, and only kept glancing around to see whether the governor’s servant was setting up a green table for whist. Their faces were plump and round, some even had warts on them, one or two were pockmarked, the hair on their heads was done neither in tufts nor in curls, nor in a “devil-may-care” fashion, as the French say—their hair was either close cropped or slicked down, and the features of their faces were mostly rounded and strong. These were the distinguished officials of the town. Alas! the fat know better than the slim how to handle their affairs in this world. The slim serve mostly on special missions, or else only nominally, and shift about here and there; their existence is somehow too light, airy, and altogether unreliable. Whereas the fat never occupy indirect positions, but always direct ones, and once they sit somewhere, they sit reliably and firmly, so that the position will sooner creak and sag under them than they will fall off of it. External glitter they do not like; their tailcoats are not so smartly cut as the slim men’s, but instead God’s blessings fill their coffers. In three years the slim man does not have a single soul left that has not been mortgaged; with the fat man all is quiet, then lo and behold— somewhere at the end of town a house appears, bought in his wife’s name, then another house at the other end, then a little hamlet nearby, and then an estate with all its appurtenances. Finally, the fat man, having served God and his sovereign, having earned universal respect, leaves the service, moves away, and becomes a landowner, a fine Russian squire, a hospitable man, and he lives and lives well. And, after him, as is the Russian custom, his slim heirs again squander all the paternal goods posthaste. It cannot be concealed that these were almost the sort of reflections that occupied Chichikov as he looked over the company, and the result was that he finally joined the fat ones, where almost all the faces he met were familiar: the prosecutor with extremely black, bushy eyebrows and a slightly winking left eye that seemed to be saying: “Let’s go to the other room, brother , I’ll tell you a little something there”—a serious and taciturn man, however; the postmaster, a short man, but a wit and a philosopher; the head magistrate, quite a reasonable and amiable man—all of whom greeted him like an old acquaintance, to which Chichikov responded by bowing slightly to one side, though not without agreeableness. He straightaway made the acquaintance of the most affable and courteous landowner Manilov and the somewhat clumsy-looking Sobakevich, who stepped on his foot first thing, and said: “I beg your pardon.” Straightaway a score card for whist was thrust at him, which he accepted with the same polite bow. They sat down at the green table and did not get up again until supper. All conversation ceased entirely, as always happens when people finally give themselves over to a sensible occupation. Though the postmaster was extremely voluble, even he, once he had taken cards in his hands, at the same moment expressed on his face a thoughtful physiognomy, placed his lower lip over the upper one, and maintained that position all through the game. When he played a face card, he would strike the table hard with his hand, saying, if it was a queen, “Go, you old granny!” and if it was a king, “Go, you Tambov muzhik!” And the head magistrate would say, “I’ll give it to him in the whiskers! in the whiskers!” Sometimes, as the cards hit the table, such expressions would escape as: “Ah! take it or leave it, make it diamonds, then!” Or simply: “Hearts! Heartaches! Spadilloes!” or “Spadillicups! Spadikins! Spadixies!” or just simply “Spads!”—names with which they had rechristened the suits in their company. As is usual, when the game was over they argued rather loudly. Our new-come guest also argued, but somehow extremely artfully, so that everyone could see he was indeed arguing, yet arguing agreeably. He never said, “You led,” but “You were pleased to lead,” “I had the honor of beating your deuce,” and the like. In order to bring his opponents even more into agreement on something, he each time offer ed around his enameled silver snuffbox, at the bottom of which they noticed two violets, put there for the scent. The newcomer’s attention was occupied particularly by the landowners Manilov and Sobakevich, of whom mention has been made above. He at once inquired about them, straightaway calling the head magistrate and the postmaster a little aside. The few questions he asked showed that the guest was not only inquisitive but also substantial; for he first of all asked how many peasant souls each of them had and what was the condition of their estates, and only then inquired as to their names and patronymics. In a short time he succeeded in charming them completely. The landowner Manilov, a man not at all old, who had eyes as sweet as sugar and narrowed them each time he laughed, was mad about him. He pressed his hand for a very long time and begged him earnestly to do him the honor of coming to his estate, which, according to him, was only ten miles from the town gates. To this, Chichikov, most politely inclining his head and sincerely squeezing his hand, replied that he was not only ready to do so with great willingness, but would even regard it as his most sacred duty. Sobakevich also said somewhat laconically: “And to my place, too”—with a scrape of his foot, shod in a boot of such gigantic size that it would hardly be possible to find a foot corresponding to it, especially nowadays, when in Russia, too, mighty men are beginning to grow scarce.","The newcomer, it appeared, avoided saying much about himself; if he did say anything, it was in general terms, with a perceptible diffidence, and his speech on such occasions would take a somewhat bookish turn as he explained that he was the most insignificant worm in this world and unworthy of arousing much concern; that he had gone through a great deal in his day; that he had endured much for the sake of truth while in the service of his country; that he had many enemies, who had even made attempts on his life; that now, desirous of finding peace and quiet, he was seeking a choice spot where he might settle down at last, and that, upon his arrival in this town, he deemed it his bounden duty to attest his respect before its foremost dignitaries. And there you have everything that the town found out about this new personage, who very shortly thereafter did not fail to show himself at the Governor’s evening-at-home. His preparations for this evening-at-home took up two hours and a bit over, and in this matter likewise the newcomer evinced such an atten-tiveness in grooming as is hardly to be met with in general. After a brief after-dinner snooze he ordered water and a washbasin to be brought and for an exceedingly long time scrubbed both his cheeks with soap, making them bulge out with his tongue; next, after taking a towel from the shoulder of the tavern waiter, he wiped his full face thoroughly, beginning with the back of his ears, but only after first snorting a couple of times in the tavern waiter’s very face; next, he put on a dickey in front of the mirror, plucked out with tweezers a hair or two that stuck out of his nose, and immediately thereafter was clad in a frock coat of a scintillating lingonberry-red hue. Having thus clothed himself, he drove off in his own carriage, rolling along through streets infinitely broad yet lit only by the scanty light from windows glimmering here and there. The Governors residence, however, was illuminated as if for nothing less than a ball; there were carriages with lamps, a brace of gendarmes before the driveway, postboys calling in the distance—in a word, everything was just right. Upon entering the main hall, Chichikov was compelled to narrow his eyes for a minute or so, since the brilliance of the candles and lamps and the ladies’ gowns was terrific. Everything was flooded with light. Everywhere one looked black frock coats flitted and darted by, singly and in clusters, as flies dart over a white, gleaming loaf of refined sugar in the summer season on a sultry July day, as an aged housekeeper standing at an open window cleaves and divides the loaf into glittering, irregular lumps: all the children, having flocked together, are looking on, curiously watching the movements of her roughened hands as they lift up the maul, while the ethereal squadrons of flies, held up by the buoyant air, dart in boldly, as if they owned the whole place and, taking advantage of the crone’s purblindness and of the sun that bothers her eyes, bestrew the delectable morsels, in some places singly, in others in thick clusters. Sated with the riches of summer, which spreads delectable repasts at every step even without such windfalls as this, they have flown in not at all in order to eat but merely to show themselves, to promenade to and fro over the mound of sugar, to rub either their hind- or their forelegs against each other, or scratch with them under their gossamer wings, or, having stretched out their forelegs, to rub them over their heads, and then once more turn around and fly away, and once more come flying back with new harassing squadrons. Chichikov had hardly had time to look about him when his hand was already seized by the Governor, who presented him on the spot to his good lady. Here, as well, the newly come guest did not fail to keep up his end: he delivered himself of some compliment, quite suitable for a man of middle age whose rank was neither too great nor too small. When the dancers who had paired off for the evening crowded everybody to the walls, he, with his hands clasped behind him, contemplated them very attentively for a few minutes. Many of the ladies were gowned well and in the latest mode; others had put on whatever the good God may have sent to a provincial capital. The men here, even as everywhere, were of two kinds: one consisted of those who were as slim as slim could be, who were forever fluttering about the ladies; some of these gallants were of the sort that one could only with difficulty tell apart from the dandies of St. Petersburg, having much the same side-whiskers, combed with quite a deal of thought and taste, although the faces of some, while comely and oval, were quite smooth-shaven; they all seated themselves next to the ladies just as airily as the dandies, spoke French just as the others did, and, just like the others, made the ladies laugh: everything was done just the way it is in St. Petersburg. The other sort consisted of stout men, or of such men as Chichikov—that is, not what you might call any too stout, but by no means slim, either. These, in contrast to the others, eyed the ladies askance and backed away from them and were constantly looking this way and that, to see if one of the Governor’s servants was not setting out the green-covered tables for whist. Their faces were full and round, some of them even with moles, while here and there one came across a fellow who was pockmarked as well; they did not dress their hair either in topknots or in curly locks or in the “may-the-Devil-take-me” mode, as the French put it; their hair was either cropped short or slicked down, while their facial features were for the most part rounded out and strong. These were the officials, the bureaucrats, highly regarded in the town. Alas! The stout ones are able to manage their affairs in this world better than the slim ones can manage theirs. The slim ones work for the most part on special missions or are merely carried on the rolls and gad about hither and yon; their existence is somehow all too easy, ethereal, and altogether insecure. But the stout ones never take up posts that are off to one side, but always those that are right in line, and once they come to roost anywhere, they will roost securely and fast, so that though the perch may crack and bend under them, yet they will never fall. They are not fond of outward glitter and show; the frock coats upon them are not so deftly cut as are those of the slim ones; but then they do have God’s own plenty in their little tin boxes. A slim fellow won’t have, in the space of three years, a single serf soul that isn’t mortgaged; the stout man plods along, slow but sure, and, lo and behold, somewhere at the end of the town a house has appeared, bought in his wife’s name; then, at the other end of the town, another house; then, a little way out of town, there’s a hamlet, and after that even a countryseat, with all the adjuncts of landed property. Finally the stout man, having served God and sovereign, having earned the respect of all, leaves his service, moves to a new place, and becomes a landed proprietor, a fine Russian squire, noted for his hospitality, and not merely lives, but lives gloriously. And after him, in the Russian fashion, his slim heirs again try to see how fast they can let all the paternal goods go down the drain. It would be impossible to conceal that reflections of almost this nature were occupying Chichikov while he was looking over the social gathering, and the consequence was that he at last joined the stout ones, among whom the personages he encountered were nearly all familiar ones: the Public Prosecutor, whose eyebrows were quite black and bushy and whose left eye had something like a habitual wink, just as though he were saying, “Let’s you and me, brother, go into the next room—there’s something I want to tell you”, but a fellow who was, nevertheless, serious and taciturn; the Postmaster, a short little man to look at, yet a wit and a philosopher; and the Chairman of the Administrative Offices, quite a judicious and amiable man. All of them welcomed Chichikov as an old acquaintance, to which welcome he responded with bows, done somewhat to one side but on the whole not without an agreeable air. It was among them that he made the acquaintance of a quite obliging and affable landowner by the name of Manilov and of a certain Sobakevich, who seemed somewhat clumsy at first glance and who began the acquaintanceship by stepping on Chichikov’s foot and then begging his pardon.6 Here, too, a place card for a whist table was thrust into his hand, which card he accepted with his unvaryingly polite bow. They seated themselves at the green baize table and never got up until supper. All talk ceased abruptly and utterly, as is always the case when people finally dedicate themselves to some really worthwhile occupation. Although the Postmaster was quite loquacious, even he, once he had picked up his cards, immediately made his face assume a cogitative expression, covering his upper lip with the lower and keeping it there all the time the game was on. When playing a court card he would strike the table hard with his hand, adding, if the card was a queen: “Go on, you Tambov muzhik!” As for the Chairman of the Administrative Offices, he would add: “Why, I’ll knock his mustache off! Til knock her mustache off!” At times, as the players slammed their cards down on the table, certain expressions would escape them: “Ah, come what may—might as well play diamonds if there’s nothing else,” or they would simply exclaim: “Hearts! Ventricles! Spadentia!” or “Spadendros! Spadeodactyl! Spade-bird!” or simply “Spadey”—the pet names with which they had rechris-tened the four suits within their own circle. At the conclusion of the game they disputed, as is the wont, quite loudly. Our newly arrived guest disputed as well, but with an extreme finesse, so that all perceived that while he was disputing he was at the same time doing so most agreeably. Never did he say, “You led,” but, “You were pleased to lead; I had the honor of covering your deuce,” and the like of that. In order to win his opponents over still more concerning some point or other he would, at every opportunity, offer them a pinch from his silver-and-enamel snuffbox, at the bottom of which they noticed two violets, placed therein to impart their fragrance to the snuff. The attention of the newcomer was especially taken up by Manilov and Sobakevich, who have been mentioned above. He immediately made inquiries about them, calling the Chairman of the Administrative Offices and the Postmaster a little to one side. The few questions he put demonstrated that this visitor possessed not merely curiosity but judiciousness as well, for first of all he asked how many serf-souls each one of them had and what condition their estates were in, and only after that did he ascertain their names and patronymics. In a short while he succeeded in absolutely enchanting them. The landowner Manilov, not at all an elderly man yet, with eyes that were as sweet as sugar, and who puckered them up every time he laughed, lost his head over Chichikov. He shook his hand for a very long time and begged him most convincingly to honor him by coming to his village, which, he said, was only some ten miles from the city limits, to which Chichikov replied, with quite a polite inclination of his head and a sincere handclasp, that he was not only ready and very willing but would even consider it his most sacred obligation to do so. Sobakevich also said, somewhat laconically: “I beg of you to come to my place also,” with a scrape of his foot, shod in a boot of such gigantic proportions that its equal was hardly to be found anywhere, especially in these times, when doughty heroes are beginning to die out even in Russia."

"— Да ведь это не такая шарманка, как носят немцы. Это орган; посмотри нарочно: вся из красного дерева. Вот я тебе покажу ее еще! — Здесь Ноздрев, схвативши за руку Чичикова, стал тащить его в другую комнату, и как тот ни упирался ногами в пол и ни уверял, что он знает уже, какая шарманка, но должен был услышать еще раз, каким образом поехал в поход Мальбруг. — Когда ты не хочешь на деньги, так вот что, слушай: я тебе дам шарманку и все, сколько ни есть у меня, мертвые души, а ты мне дай свою бричку и триста рублей придачи.","“Why, it’s not such a hurdy-gurdy as the Germans wear. This is an organ; look on purpose: all mahogany. Here I'll show you more! - Here Nozdryov, grabbing Chichikov by the hand, began to drag him into another room, and no matter how he put his feet on the floor and assured that he already knew what kind of barrel organ, he should have heard again how Malbrug went on a campaign. “When you don’t want money, listen to this: I’ll give you a hurdy-gurdy and all the dead souls I have, and you give me your britzka and three hundred rubles in addition.","“But this isn’t the sort of barrel-organ Germans go about with, you know. It’s an organ; take a good look at it; it’s all mahogany. I’ll show it to you again!” At this point Nozdryov seizing Tchitchikov by the arm dragged him into the adjoining room and, though he held his ground firmly and declared that he knew what the barrel-organ was like, he had to hear how Marlborough went to war once more. “If you don’t want to buy it, I tell you, I’ll give you the barrel-organ and all the dead souls I have got, and you give me your chaise and three hundred roubles thrown in.”","“But this is quite a different kind of organ from the one which Germans take about with them. You see, it is a REAL organ. Look at it for yourself. It is made of the best wood. I will take you to have another view of it.” And seizing Chichikov by the hand, Nozdrev drew him towards the other room, where, in spite of the fact that Chichikov, with his feet planted firmly on the floor, assured his host, again and again, that he knew exactly what the organ was like , he was forced once more to hear how Marlborough went to the war. “Then, since you don’t care to give me any money for it,” persisted Nozdrev, “listen to the following proposal. I will give you the barrel-organ and all the dead souls which I possess, and in return you shall give me your britchka, and another three hundred roubles into the bargain.” “Listen to the man!","“But this is not the sort of barrel organ Germans go around with. This is a real organ; look on purpose: it’s all mahogany. Come, I’ll show it to you again!” Here Nozdryov, seizing Chichikov by the hand, started pulling him into the other room, and no matter how he dug his heels into the floor and assured him that he already knew this barrel organ, he still had to listen again to precisely how Malbrough went off to war. “If you don’t want to stake money, listen, here’s what: I’ll give you the barrel organ and all the dead souls I have, and you give me your britzka and three hundred roubles on top of it.”","“But this isn’t the sort of hurdy-gurdy the Germans carry around. It’s an organ; take a special look at it, it’s all made of mahogany. There, I’ll show it to you once more!” At this point Nozdrev, seizing Chichikov by the hand, began dragging him into the other room and, no matter how the latter held back, hand and foot, resisting and protesting that he already knew what the hurdy-gurdy was like, he nevertheless had to listen once more to just how Malbrouk to the wars had gone. “If you don’t want to lay out any money for it, then I’ll tell you what I’ll do, you just listen: I’ll give you the hurdy-gurdy, and all the dead souls I own, as many as there are of them, and you give me your carriage and three hundred to boot.”"
"— Итак?.. — сказал Чичиков, ожидая не без некоторого волнения ответа.","""So?"" said Chichikov, expecting, not without some excitement, an answer.","“And so ... ?” said Tchitchikov, waiting not without some perturbation for an answer.",“Well?” said Chichikov—though not without a certain tremor of diffidence as to the possible response.,"“And so …?” said Chichikov, waiting not without some anxiety for an answer.","“And so?” asked Chichikov, awaiting, not without a certain agitation, the other’s reaction."

Here I will give you a deposit of two thousand at once, eight thousand in a week’s time, and the remaining twenty thousand in a month.”","“That being so,” said Chichikov, taken aback, “I beg to agree to the price in question. At the same time, I must ask you to allow me to defer payment of one-half of the purchase money until a year from now.”","“All right!” he said. “I’ll pay you thirty thousand. Here, I’ll give you two thousand now as a deposit, eight thousand in a week, and the remaining twenty thousand in a month.”",
"— Ничего, ничего, — сказала хозяйка. — В какое это время вас бог принес!

Such a turmoil and a blizzard ... You should have something to eat from the road, but it's time for the night, you can't cook.","“It’s all right, it’s all right!” said the old lady. “In what weather God has brought you! Such a storm of wind and rain.... You ought to have something to eat after your journey, but it is night-time, we can’t cook anything.”","“Not at all, not at all,” replied the lady. “But in what dreadful weather God has brought you hither! What wind and what rain! You could not help losing your way. Pray excuse us for being unable to make better preparations for you at this time of night.”","“Never mind, never mind,” said the mistress. “What weather for God to bring you in! Such turmoil and blizzard … You ought to eat something after your journey, but it’s nighttime, no way to prepare anything.”","“Not at all, not at all!” said the hostess. “What a night for God to bring you to us!

"— Готова? Пожалуйте ее сюда! — Он пробежал ее глазами и подивился аккуратности и точности: не только было обстоятельно прописано ремесло, звание, лета и семейное состояние, но даже на полях находились особенные отметки насчет поведения, трезвости, — словом, любо было глядеть.","— Ready? Please bring her here! He ran his eyes over it and marveled at the accuracy and precision: not only was the craft, rank, years and family condition spelled out in detail, but even in the margins there were special marks about behavior, sobriety - in a word, it was a pleasure to look at.","“Is it ready? Please hand it over!” He ran his eyes over it and was surprised at its neatness and precision; not only the trade, the calling, the age, and family circumstances were minutely entered, but there were even marginal notes regarding behaviour and sobriety—in fact it was a pleasure to look at it.","“The list is ready,” said Sobakevitch, turning round. “Indeed! Then please let me look at it.” Chichikov ran his eye over the document, and could not but marvel at its neatness and accuracy. Not only were there set forth in it the trade, the age, and the pedigree of every serf, but on the margin of the sheet were jotted remarks concerning each serf’s conduct and sobriety. Truly it was a pleasure to look at it.","“Ready? Let me have it, please!” He ran down it with his eyes and marveled at its accuracy and precision: not only were trade, name, age, and family situation thoroughly indicated, but there were even special marginal notes concerning behavior, sobriety—in short, it was lovely to look at.","“Ready? Let’s have it, please.” He ran his eyes over it and was struck by its accuracy and meticu-lousness: not only were the trade, position, years, and family status of each dead soul written out in detail, but there were even to be found, on the margins, special notations regarding that soul’s conduct and sobriety—in a word, the list was a delight to behold."
"— Ступай к каретнику, чтобы поставил коляску на полозки, — сказал Чичиков, а сам пошел в город, но ни к кому не хотел заходить отдавать прощальных визитов. После всего этого события было и неловко, — тем более что о нем множество ходило в городе самых неблагоприятных историй. Он избегал всяких встреч и зашел потихоньку только к тому купцу, у которого купил сукна наваринского пламени с дымом, взял вновь четыре аршина на фрак и на штаны и отправился сам к тому же портному. За двойную цену мастер решился усилить рвение и засадил всю ночь работать при свечах портное народонаселение — иглами, утюгами и зубами, и фрак на другой день был готов, хотя и немножко поздно. Лошади все были запряжены. Чичиков, однако ж, фрак примерил. Он был хорош, точь-точь как прежний. Но, увы! он заметил, что в голове уже белело что-то гладкое, и примолвил грустно: «И зачем было предаваться так сильно сокрушенью? А рвать волос не следовало бы и подавно». Расплатившись с портным, он выехал наконец из города в каком-то странном положении. Это был не прежний Чичиков. Это была какая-то развалина прежнего Чичикова. Можно было сравнить его внутреннее состояние души с разобранным строеньем, которое разобрано с тем, чтобы строить из него же новое; а новое еще не начиналось, потому что не пришел от архитектора определительный план и работники остались в недоуменье. Часом прежде его отправился старик Муразов, в рогоженной кибитке, вместе с Потапычем, а часом после отъезда Чичикова пошло приказание, что князь, по случаю отъезда в Петербург, желает видеть всех чиновников до едина.","""Go to the carriage-maker to put the carriage on the runners,"" said Chichikov, and he himself went into town, but did not want to go to anyone to pay farewell visits. After all this event, it was embarrassing, especially since there were many most unfavorable stories about him in the city. He avoided all meetings and went quietly only to the merchant from whom he had bought cloth of Navarino flame with smoke, again took four arshins for a tailcoat and trousers, and went himself to the same tailor. For a double price, the master decided to increase his zeal and planted the tailor population to work all night by candlelight - with needles, irons and teeth, and the tailcoat was ready the next day, although a little late. The horses were all harnessed. Chichikov, however, tried on a tailcoat. He was good, just like the old one. But, alas! he noticed that something smooth was already whitening in his head, and he said sadly: “And why did you indulge in so much contrition? And tearing your hair should not be even more so. ” After paying off the tailor, he finally left the city in a strange position. It was not the old Chichikov. It was some kind of ruin of the former Chichikov. One could compare his inner state of soul with a dismantled structure, which is dismantled in order to build a new one out of it; and the new has not yet begun, because the definitive plan did not come from the architect and the workers remained at a loss. An hour before him, old Murazov left, in a bast wagon, together with Potapych, and an hour after Chichikov's departure, an order came that the prince, on the occasion of his departure for Petersburg, wanted to see all the officials to one.","“Go to the carriage-maker’s and get the carriage put on runners instead of wheels,” said Tchitchikov. He himself went off to the town, not that he was anxious to pay farewell visits to any one. It would have been rather awkward after all that had happened, especially as there were the most discreditable stories going about the town concerning him. He even avoided meeting any one and only went as stealthily as possible to the merchant’s from whom he had bought the cloth of the “flame and smoke of Navarino,” he took four yards for a coat and breeches, and went off with it himself to the same tailor. For double the price the latter undertook to work at the highest pressure, and set the tailoring population plying their needles, their irons and their teeth all night by candle-light, and the coat was ready next day, though a little late. The horses were all harnessed and waiting. Tchitchikov tried on the coat, however. It was splendid, exactly like the first. But alas! he noticed a smooth white patch upon his head, and murmured sorrowfully: “What reason was there to abandon myself to such despair? I oughtn’t to have torn out my hair anyway.” After settling with the tailor he drove out of the town at last in a strange frame of mind. This was not the old Tchitchikov; this was a sort of wreck of the old Tchitchikov. The inner state of his soul might be compared with a building that has been pulled down to be rebuilt into a new one, and the new one has not yet been begun, because no definite plan has come from the architect, and the workmen are left in suspense. An hour earlier old Murazov had set off together with Potapitch in a covered cart, and an hour after Tchitchikov’s departure an order went forth that the prince wished to see all the officials, every one of them, on the eve of his departure for Petersburg.","“Go to the coachbuilder’s,” commanded Chichikov, “and have sledge-runners fitted to the koliaska.” Chichikov then made his way into the town—though not with the object of paying farewell visits (in view of recent events, that might have given rise to some awkwardness), but for the purpose of paying an unobtrusive call at the shop where he had obtained the cloth for his latest suit. There he now purchased four more arshins of the same smoked-grey-shot-with-flame-colour material as he had had before, with the intention of having it made up by the tailor who had fashioned the previous costume; and by promising double remuneration he induced the tailor in question so to hasten the cutting out of the garments that, through sitting up all night over the work, the man might have the whole ready by break of day. True, the goods were delivered a trifle after the appointed hour, yet the following morning saw the coat and breeches completed; and while the horses were being put to, Chichikov tried on the clothes, and found them equal to the previous creation, even though during the process he caught sight of a bald patch on his head, and was led mournfully to reflect: “Alas! Why did I give way to such despair? Surely I need not have torn my hair out so freely?” Then, when the tailor had been paid, our hero left the town. But no longer was he the old Chichikov—he was only a ruin of what he had been, and his frame of mind might have been compared to a building recently pulled down to make room for a new one, while the new one had not yet been erected owing to the non-receipt of the plans from the architect. Murazov, too, had departed, but at an earlier hour, and in a tilt-waggon with Ivan Potapitch.","“Go to the carriage maker and have the carriage put on runners,” said Chichikov, and he himself went to town, though he had no wish to pay farewell calls on anyone. It was awkward after all these happenings—the more so as there were many highly unfavorable stories about him going around town. He avoided meeting anyone and only stopped on the quiet to see that merchant from whom he had bought the cloth of the color of the flames and smoke of Navarino, bought another three yards for a tailcoat and trousers, and went to the same tailor. For double the price, the master undertook to increase his zeal, and kept the whole sewing populace sitting up all night working by candlelight with needles, irons, and teeth, so that the tailcoat was ready the next day, albeit a little late. The horses were all harnessed. Chichikov did try the tailcoat on, however. It was fine, the same as the previous one. But, alas! he noticed some smooth patches showing pale on his head and remarked ruefully: “Why did I give myself over to such contrition? And, what’s more, tear my hair out!” Having paid the tailor, he finally drove out of town in some strange disposition. This was not the old Chichikov. This was some wreckage of the old Chichikov. The inner state of his soul might be compared to a demolished building, which has been demolished so that from it a new one could be built; but the new one has not been started yet, because the definitive plan has not yet come from the architect and the workers are left in perplexity. An hour before him, old Murazov set out in a burlap kibitka with Potapych, and an hour after Chichikov’s departure an order was issued that the prince, on the occasion of his departure for Petersburg, wished to see all his officials to a man.",

"«Нет, я не так, — говорил Чичиков, очутившись опять посреди открытых полей и пространств, — нет, я не так распоряжусь. Как только, даст бог, все покончу благополучно и сделаюсь действительно состоятельным, зажиточным человеком, я поступлю тогда совсем иначе: будет у меня и повар, и дом, как полная чаша, но будет и хозяйственная часть в порядке. Концы сведутся с концами, да понемножку всякий год будет откладываться сумма и для потомства, если только бог пошлет жене плодородье…» — Эй ты — дурачина!","“No, I’m not like that,” said Chichikov, finding himself again in the middle of open fields and spaces, “no, I’m not going to order it that way. As soon as, God willing, I finish everything safely and become a really wealthy, prosperous person, then I will do something completely different: I will have a cook and a house, like a full bowl, but the economic part will be in order.

I will have a good cook and a house well provided in every way, but it shall all be managed properly too.

Hey, you great stupid!“","“If Colonel Koshkarev should turn out to be as mad as the last one it is a bad look-out,” said Chichikov to himself on opening his eyes amid fields and open country— everything else having disappeared save the vault of heaven and a couple of low-lying clouds.","“No, not like that,” Chichikov was saying as he found himself again in the midst of the open fields and spaces, “I wouldn’t handle it like that. As soon as, God willing, I finish it all happily and indeed become a well-to-do, prosperous man, I’ll behave quite differently: I’ll have a cook, and a house full of plenty, but the managerial side will also be in order. The ends will meet, and a little sum will be set aside each year for posterity, if only God grants my wife fruitfulness … “Hey, you tomfool!”",

"Так говорил Кошкарев, введя его в книгохранилище. Это был огромный зал, снизу доверху уставленный книгами. Были там даже и чучела животных. Книги по всем частям — по части лесоводства, скотоводства, свиноводства, садоводства, тысячи всяких журналов, руководств и множество журналов, представлявших самые позднейшие развития и усовершенствования и по коннозаводству и естественным наукам. Были и такие названия: «Свиноводство как наука». Видя, что здесь вещи не приятного препровождения времени, он обратился к другому шкафу. Из огня — в полымя. Тут были всё книги философии. На одной было заглавие: «Философия, в смысле науки»; шесть томов в ряд под названием: «Предуготовительное вступление к теории мышления в их общности, совокупности, сущности и во применении к уразумению органических начал обоюдного раздвоенья общественной производительности». Что ни разворачивал Чичиков книгу, на всякой странице — проявленье, развитье, абстракт, замкнутость и сомкнутость, и черт знает, чего там не было. «Нет, это все не по мне», — сказал Чичиков и оборотился к третьему шкафу, где были книги всё по части искусств. Тут вытащил он какую-то огромную книгу с нескромными мифологическими картинками и начал их рассматривать. Это было по его вкусу. Такого рода картинки нравятся холостякам средних лет. Говорят, что в последнее время стали они нравиться даже и старичкам, изощрившим вкус на балетах. Что ж делать, человечество нашего века пряные коренья любит. Окончивши рассматриванье этой книги, Чичиков вытащил уже было и другую в том же роде, как вдруг появился полковник Кошкарев, с сияющим видом и бумагою.","This is what Koshkarev said as he led him into the book depository. It was a huge hall filled from top to bottom with books. There were even stuffed animals. Books in all parts - in the field of forestry, cattle breeding, pig breeding, horticulture, thousands of all kinds of magazines, manuals and many magazines representing the latest developments and improvements in horse breeding and natural sciences. There were also such names: ""Pig breeding as a science."" Seeing that there were not pleasant pastimes here, he turned to another closet. From fire to fire. There were all the books of philosophy. One was titled ""Philosophy, in the sense of science""; six volumes in a row entitled: ""A Preparatory Introduction to the Theory of Thinking in Their Generality, Totality, Essence and in Application to the Comprehension of the Organic Principles of the Mutual Bifurcation of Social Productivity."" No matter how Chichikov unfolded the book, on every page there was manifestation, development, abstraction, isolation and closeness, and the devil knows what was not there. ""No, it's all not for me,"" said Chichikov, and turned to the third bookcase, where there were books, all on the part of the arts. Then he pulled out some huge book with immodest mythological pictures and began to examine them. It was to his liking. This kind of pictures appeal to middle-aged bachelors. They say that even old people who have refined their taste in ballets have recently begun to like them. What to do, the mankind of our century loves spicy roots. Having finished examining this book, Chichikov was already pulling out another of the same kind, when Colonel Koshkarev suddenly appeared, with a beaming look and paper.","So said the colonel as he opened the door into his library. It was an immense apartment, the walls of which were lined with books from the floor to the ceiling. There were even stuffed animals in it. There were books on every subject—on forestry, cattle-rearing, pig-breeding, gardening, thousands of all sorts of magazines, handbooks and masses of journals representing the very latest development and perfection in horse breeding and the natural sciences. There were titles such as Pig-breeding as a Science. Seeing that these were all subjects that did not offer an agreeable way of passing the time, he turned to other bookcases. It was out of the frying-pan into the fire: there all the books were on philosophy. The title of one was Philosophy as a Science. There were six volumes in a row, entitled Preliminary Introduction to the Theory of Thought in its General Aspect as a Whole, and in its Application to the Interpretation of the Organic Principles of the Mutual Distribution of Social Productivity. Wherever Tchitchikov opened the book, on every page he found “phenomenon,” “development,” “abstract,” “cohesion” and “combination”; and the devil only knows what. “No, all that’s not in my line,” thought Tchitchikov, and he turned to the third bookcase, where all the books related to art. Here he pulled out a huge volume of somewhat free mythological pictures, and began looking at them. That was to his taste. Middle-aged bachelors always like such pictures. It is said that of late years old gentlemen have acquired a taste for them excited by the ballet. There is no help for it. Man is fond of spices. When he had finished looking through this book Tchitchikov was about to pull out another of the same class, when Colonel Koshkaryov made his appearance with a beaming face, holding a paper in his hand.","So saying, he ushered his guest into a large room lined from floor to ceiling with books and stuffed specimens. The books in question were divided into sections—a section on forestry, a section on cattle-breeding, a section on the raising of swine, and a section on horticulture, together with special journals of the type circulated merely for the purposes of reference, and not for general reading. Perceiving that these works were scarcely of a kind calculated to while away an idle hour, Chichikov turned to a second bookcase. But to do so was to fall out of the frying-pan into the fire, for the contents of the second bookcase proved to be works on philosophy, while, in particular, six huge volumes confronted him under a label inscribed “A Preparatory Course to the Province of Thought, with the Theory of Community of Effort, Co-operation, and Subsistence, in its Application to a Right Understanding of the Organic Principles of a Mutual Division of Social Productivity.” Indeed, wheresoever Chichikov looked, every page presented to his vision some such words as “phenomenon,” “development,” “abstract,” “contents,” and “synopsis.” “This is not the sort of thing for me,” he murmured, and turned his attention to a third bookcase, which contained books on the Arts. Extracting a huge tome in which some by no means reticent mythological illustrations were contained, he set himself to examine these pictures. They were of the kind which pleases mostly middle-aged bachelors and old men who are accustomed to seek in the ballet and similar frivolities a further spur to their waning passions. Having concluded his examination, Chichikov had just extracted another volume of the same species when Colonel Koshkarev returned with a document of some sort and a radiant countenance.","So spoke Koshkarev as he led him into the library. It was a huge room, with books from floor to ceiling. There were even stuffed animals. Books in all fields—forestry, cattle breeding, pig breeding, gardening, thousands of assorted journals, guidebooks, and a multitude of journals presenting the latest developments and improvements in horse breeding and natural science. There were such titles as: Pig Breeding as a Science. Seeing that these things were not for the pleasant passing of time, he turned to another bookcase. From the frying pan into the fire. They were all books of philosophy. One bore the title: Philosophy in a Scientific Sense. There was a row of six volumes entitled: A Preparatory Introduction to the Theory of Thinking in Their Entirety, Totality, Essence, and Application to the Comprehension of the Organic Principles of the Mutual Divarication of Social Production. Whichever book Chichikov opened, there was on every page a manifestation, a development, an abstract, enclosures, disclosures, and devil knows what was not there. “No, this is all not for me,” Chichikov said, and turned to the third bookcase, which contained everything in the line of the arts. Here he pulled out some huge book with immodest mythological pictures and began studying them. This was to his taste. Middle-aged bachelors like such pictures. They say that recently they have begun to be liked even by little old men who have refined their taste at the ballet. What can be done about it, in our age mankind likes spicy roots. Having finished studying this book, Chichikov was already pulling out another of the same sort, when suddenly Colonel Koshkarev appeared with a beaming face and a paper.",
"— Ну нет, не мечта! Я вам доложу, каков был Михеев, так вы таких людей не сыщете: машинища такая, что в эту комнату не войдет; нет, это не мечта! А в плечищах у него была такая силища, какой нет у лошади; хотел бы я знать, где бы вы в другом месте нашли такую мечту!","- No, not a dream! I’ll tell you what Mikheev was like, you won’t find such people: the car is such that you won’t enter this room; no, this is not a dream! And in his shoulders he had such strength as a horse does not have; I would like to know where else you would find such a dream!","“But no, they are not a dream! I tell you, Mihyeev was a man you won’t find the like of again! He was such a giant, he couldn’t have walked into this room: no, he’s not a dream! He had more strength in his huge great shoulders than a horse. I should like to know where else you would find a dream like that!”",“But no—NOT only in idea. I tell you that nowhere else would you find such a fellow for working heavy tools as was Michiev. He had the strength of a horse in his shoulders.”,"“Oh, no, not a dream! I’ll tell you what sort Mikheev was, one of those people you don’t find anymore: such a huge machine, he wouldn’t fit into this room; no, it’s not a dream! And there was such tremendous strength in his tremendous shoulders as no horse ever had; I’d like to know where else you’ll find such a dream!”","“Well, no, they’re no dream! Allow me to inform you that you’ll never find such men as Mikheev was; he was such a mountain of a man that he could never get into this room; no, he was no dream! And as for those hams of shoulders he had, there was such a store of strength in them as no horse has. I’d like to know what other place you’d find such a dream in!”"
"Чичиков оглянулся и увидел, что на столе стояли уже грибки, пирожки, скородумки, шанишки, пряглы,[5] блины, лепешки со всякими припеками: припекой с лучком, припекой с маком, припекой с творогом, припекой со сняточками, и невесть чего не было.","Chichikov looked around and saw that on the table there were already mushrooms, pies, quick thinkers, shanishkas, spinners, [5] pancakes, flat cakes with all sorts of seasonings: onion seasoning, poppyseed seasoning, cottage cheese seasoning, shots, and who knows what else. It was.","Tchitchikov looked round and saw that the table was already spread with mushrooms, pies, fritters, cheesecakes, doughnuts, pancakes, open tarts with all sorts of different fillings, some with onions, some with poppy seeds, some with curds, and some with fish, and there is no knowing what else. “Some egg pie,” said his hostess.","Chichikov looked up, and saw that the table was spread with mushrooms, pies, and other viands. “Try this freshly-made pie and an egg,” continued Madame.","Chichikov turned around and saw the table already laden with mushrooms, pirozhki, savory dumplings, cheesecakes, pancakes thick and thin, open pies with all kinds of fillings: onion filling, poppy seed filling, cottage cheese filling, smelt filling, and who knows what else. “Short-crust pie with eggs!” said the mistress.","Chichikov looked around him and beheld, already standing on the table, small mushrooms, patties, hasty pudding, curd tarts, fritters, pancakes, and wafers with all sorts of baked additions—baked chopped onion, baked poppy seed, baked curds, baked clotted cream—and Heaven alone knows how many other things were there. “This is an unleavened turnover with eggs!”"
Чичиков изъявил готовность совершить ее хоть сию же минуту и потребовал только списка всем крестьянам.,Chichikov expressed his readiness to carry it out at least this very minute and demanded only a list of all the peasants.,"Tchitchikov expressed his readiness to complete the purchase that very minute, and asked for nothing but a list of all the peasants.",To this Chichikov assented readily enough—merely adding that he should like first of all to be furnished with a list of the dead souls.,Chichikov expressed a readiness to sign it that very minute and asked only for a list of all the peasants.,Chichikov evinced a readiness to make out the purchase deed that very instant; all he asked for was a list of the dead serfs.
"— В таком случае я разбогатею, — сказал Чичиков, — потому что начинаю почти, так сказать, с ничего.","""In that case, I'll get rich,"" said Chichikov, ""because I'm starting almost, so to speak, with nothing.""","“In that case I shall get rich,” said Tchitchikov, “because I am beginning almost, so to say, from nothing.”","“If that is so, I shall grow rich,” said Chichikov, involuntarily remembering the dead souls.","“In that case I’ll get rich,” said Chichikov, “because I’m beginning, so to speak, from almost nothing.”",
"— А тебе барабан; не правда ли, тебе барабан? — продолжал он, наклонившись к Алкиду.","- A drum for you; don't you, you drum? he continued, leaning towards Alcides.","“And you a drum. You would like a drum, wouldn’t you?” Tchitchikov went on, bending down to Alkides.","“And to you, Alkid, I will bring a drum. That would suit you, would it not?”","“And you a drum, right? a drum for you?” he went on, bending down to Alkides.","“And for you a drum. A drum for you, eh?” Chichikov went on, bending toward Alcides."
"— Что, батюшка, слепы-то, что ли? — спросил ключник. — Эхва! А вить хозяин-то я!","- What, father, are they blind, or what? the keykeeper asked. - Ehwa! And I'm the owner!","“Why, are you blind, my good sir?” said the steward. “Upon my soul! I am the master!”","“Are you blind, my good sir?” retorted the other. “I am the master.”","“What, my dear, are you blind or something?” said the housekeeper. “Egad!

"А между тем в существе своем Андрей Иванович был не то доброе, не то дурное существо, а просто — коптитель неба. Так как уже немало есть на белом свете людей, коптящих небо, то почему же и Тентетникову не коптить его? Впрочем, вот в немногих словах весь журнал его дня, и пусть из него судит читатель сам, какой у него был характер.","And meanwhile, in his essence, Andrei Ivanovich was not that good, not that bad creature, but simply - a smoker of the sky. Since there are already quite a few people in the world smoking the sky, why shouldn't Tentetnikov also smoke it? However, here in a few words is the whole journal of his day, and let the reader judge for himself what kind of character he had.","Yet Andrey Ivanovitch was neither good nor bad in his life and actions—he simply vegetated. Since there are not a few people in this world who do vegetate, why should not Tyentyetnikov vegetate? Here, however, in a few words is a full chronicle of his day, and from it the reader may judge for himself of his character.","To speak dispassionately, however, he was not a bad sort of fellow—merely a star-gazer; and since the world contains many watchers of the skies, why should Tientietnikov not have been one of them? However, let me describe in detail a specimen day of his existence—one that will closely resemble the rest, and then the reader will be enabled to judge of Tientietnikov’s character, and how far his life corresponded to the beauties of nature with which he lived surrounded.","And yet in his essence Andrei Ivanovich was neither a good nor a bad being, but simply—a burner of the daylight. Since there are already not a few people in the world occupied with burning the daylight, why should Tentetnikov not burn it as well? However, here in a few words is the full journal of his day, and from it the reader himself can judge what his character was.",
"Таким образом рассуждали и говорили в городе, и многие, побуждаемые участием, сообщили даже Чичикову лично некоторые из сих советов, предлагали даже конвой для безопасного препровожденья крестьян до места жительства. За советы Чичиков благодарил, говоря, что при случае не преминет ими воспользоваться, а от конвоя отказался решительно, говоря, что он совершенно не нужен, что купленные им крестьяне отменно смирного характера, чувствуют сами добровольное расположение к переселению и что бунта ни в каком случае между ними быть не может.","In this way they reasoned and spoke in the city, and many, motivated by participation, even personally told Chichikov some of these tips, even offered an escort to safely escort the peasants to their place of residence. Chichikov thanked for the advice, saying that he would not fail to use it on occasion, but resolutely refused the escort, saying that it was completely unnecessary, that the peasants he bought were of an excellently meek nature, they themselves felt a voluntary disposition for resettlement, and that rebellion in any case there cannot be between them.","So they argued and discussed it in the town, and many persons, moved by their sympathy, communicated some of this advice to Tchitchikov, and even offered him an escort to ensure the arrival of the peasants in safety at their new homes. Tchitchikov thanked them for their advice, saying that he would not fail to follow it should occasion arise, but he resolutely declined to escort, maintaining that it was quite unnecessary, that the peasants he had bought were of an exemplarily docile character, and were themselves favourably disposed to migration, and that there could not possibly be a mutiny among them.","Indeed such was the interest taken by certain citizens in the matter that they advised the purchaser to provide himself and his convoy with an escort, in order to ensure their safe arrival at the appointed destination; but though Chichikov thanked the donors of this advice for the same, and declared that he should be very glad, in case of need, to avail himself of it, he declared also that there was no real need for an escort, seeing that the peasants whom he had purchased were exceptionally peace-loving folk, and that, being themselves consenting parties to the transferment, they would undoubtedly prove in every way tractable.","Thus went the talk and discussion in town, and many, moved by sympathy, even conveyed some of this advice to Chichikov personally, even offered a convoy to escort the peasants to their place of settlement. Chichikov thanked them for the advice, saying that in the event he would not fail to make use of it, but he decidedly rejected the convoy, saying it was totally unnecessary, that the peasants he had bought were of superbly placid character, felt benevolently disposed towards resettlement themselves, and that a riot among them was in any event impossible.","In such a manner did the good people of the town dispute and talk, and many, moved by sympathy, imparted to Chichikov certain of these counsels personally, even proposing a convoy for the safe transport of the peasants to their new locality. For these counsels Chichikov thanked them, saying that should the need arise he would not fail to avail himself of their aid; but as for the convoy, he turned it down in positive terms, saying that it was absolutely unnecessary, since the peasants he had bought up were extraordinarily docile in character, because they themselves voluntarily favored the resettlement, and that an uprising among them was quite out of the question."
"— Так себе, — отвечал Чичиков весьма сухо.","""So-so,"" Chichikov answered very dryly.","“So-so,” answered Tchitchikov very drily.","“Fairly well,” replied Chichikov, but with a touch of dryness in his tone.","“So-so,” Chichikov replied rather dryly.","“So-so,” Chichikov replied, quite coldly."
"— Ну, может быть, это вам так показалось: он только что масон, а такой дурак, какого свет не производил.","“Well, maybe it seemed that way to you: he was just a Freemason, but such a fool as the world did not produce.","“Well, perhaps he seems so to you. Although he is a freemason, he is the greatest fool on earth.”","“Did he seem so to you? True, he is a mason, but he is also the greatest fool that the world ever saw.”","“Well, maybe it seemed so to you: he’s a mason, but otherwise as big a fool as the world has yet produced.”","“Well, perhaps he may have struck you that way; he may be a Mason, but just the same he’s a fool whose like the world has never yet produced.”"
"«Что ж? почему ж не проездиться? — думал между тем Платонов. — Авось-либо будет повеселее. Дома же мне делать нечего, хозяйство и без того на руках у брата; стало быть, расстройства никакого. Почему ж, в самом деле, не проездиться?»","""Well? why not drive? thought Platonov meanwhile. - Perhaps it will be more fun. At home, I have nothing to do, the economy is already in the hands of my brother; therefore, no disorder. Why, in fact, not to drive?","“Well, why not go for a trip?” Platonov was thinking meanwhile; “maybe it would cheer me up. I have nothing to do at home, my brother looks after everything as it is; so it would not be disarranging things. After all why shouldn’t I amuse myself?”","“Well, why should I not adopt the suggestion?” was Platon’s thought. “There is nothing for me to do at home, since the management of the estate is in my brother’s hands, and my going would cause him no inconvenience. Yes, why should I not do as Chichikov has suggested?”","“Well, then, why not take a trip?” Platonov was thinking meanwhile. “It really might cheer me up. I have nothing to do at home, the management is in my brother’s hands anyway ; so there won’t be any trouble. Why, indeed, not take a trip?”",

"— Видите ли? он всех удовлетворил, — сказал Платонов. — Однако же, скажите просто: есть ли у вас время, что бы заехать в одну деревню, отсюда верст десять? Мне бы хотелось проститься с сестрой и зятем.","— Do you see? he satisfied everyone,” Platonov said. “However, tell me simply: do you have time to go to one village, ten versts from here?” I would like to say goodbye to my sister and son-in-law.","“You see he has satisfied every one,” said Platonov. “But tell me truly, can you spare the time to go out of your way to a village some seven or eight miles from here? I should like to say good-bye to my sister and my brother-in-law.”",What a fortune!” “Do you mind where we drive?” asked Platon. “I should like first to go and take leave of my sister and my brother-in-law.”,"“You see? He’s satisfied everyone,” said Platon. “Tell me simply, however: do you have time to stop by at a certain estate, some six miles from here? I’d like to say good-bye to my sister and brother-in-law.”",
"— Ну, на вывод другое дело. А в какие места?","- Well, the conclusion is another matter. And to what places?","“Well, that’s a different matter; in what part of the country?”",That is quite another matter. To what province of the country?”,"“Well, resettlement is something else. And to what parts?”","“Well, if it’s for resettlement, that’s another matter; and whereabouts will you resettle them?” “Whereabouts?..."

"Это заключение, точно, было никак неожиданно и во всех отношениях необыкновенно. Приятная дама, услышав это, так и окаменела на месте, побледнела, побледнела, как смерть и, точно, перетревожилась не на шутку.","This conclusion, to be sure, was by no means unexpected and in every respect unusual. The pleasant lady, hearing this, was petrified on the spot, turned pale, turned pale as death, and, as if, was seriously alarmed.","This conclusion was indeed utterly unexpected and in every way extraordinary.

"— И при этом скучать. Непонятно! Но, может быть, именье в беспорядке? были неурожаи, много людей вымерло?","- And be bored at the same time. Unclear!

"— Я готов, — сказал Чичиков. — От вас зависит только назначить время. Был бы грех с моей стороны, если бы для эдакого приятного общества да не раскупорить другую-третью бутылочку шипучего.","""I'm ready,"" said Chichikov. - It's up to you to set the time. It would be a sin on my part if, for such a pleasant company, I didn’t open another or third bottle of fizzy.","“I am quite ready,” said Tchitchikov. “You have only to name a time. It would be remiss if for such excellent company I did not uncork two or three bottles of fizz.”","“For that too I am ready,” said Chichikov. “Do you but name the hour. If, in return for your most agreeable company, I were not to set a few champagne corks flying, I should be indeed in default.”","“I’m ready,” said Chichikov. “It’s for you to name the time.

"«А что ж, — подумал про себя Чичиков, — заеду я в самом деле к Ноздреву. Чем же он хуже других, такой же человек, да еще и проигрался. Горазд он, как видно, на все, стало быть, у него даром можно кое-что выпросить».","""Well,"" Chichikov thought to himself, ""I'm really going to visit Nozdryov. Why is he worse than others, the same person, and even lost. He is, as you can see, ready for everything, so you can get something from him for nothing.","“Well,” thought Tchitchikov to himself, “why shouldn’t I really go to Nozdryov’s. Isn’t he as good as any one else and he has just lost money too. He is ready for anything as one can see. So one might get him to give one something for nothing.","“Shall I, or shall I not, go to Nozdrev’s?” reflected Chichikov. “Is he likely to prove any more useful than the rest? Well, at least he is as promising, even though he has lost so much at play. But he has a head on his shoulders, and therefore I must go carefully if I am to tackle him concerning my scheme.”","“Well, why not?” Chichikov thought to himself. “I may in fact go to Nozdryov’s. He’s no worse than the rest, a man like any other, and what’s more he just gambled his money away. He’s game for anything, as one can see, which means one may get something out of him gratis.”","“Well, and why not?” Chichikov thought to himself. “Guess I’ll really drop in at Nozdrev’s. In what way is he worse than the others? Just as human as they, and on top of that he’s lost his shirt gambling. He’s ready for anything and everything, apparently; therefore one may wheedle a thing or two out of him for a song.”"
"Когда Чичиков взглянул искоса на Собакевича, он ему на этот раз показался весьма похожим на средней величины медведя. Для довершения сходства фрак на нем был совершенно медвежьего цвета, рукава длинны, панталоны длинны, ступнями ступал он и вкривь и вкось и наступал беспрестанно на чужие ноги. Цвет лица имел каленый, горячий, какой бывает на медном пятаке. Известно, что есть много на свете таких лиц, над отделкою которых натура недолго мудрила, не употребляла никаких мелких инструментов, как-то: напильников, буравчиков и прочего, но просто рубила со своего плеча: хватила топором раз — вышел нос, хватила в другой — вышли губы, большим сверлом ковырнула глаза и, не обскобливши, пустила на свет, сказавши: «Живет!» Такой же самый крепкий и на диво стаченный образ был у Собакевича: держал он его более вниз, чем вверх, шеей не ворочал вовсе и в силу такого неповорота редко глядел на того, с которым говорил, но всегда или на угол печки, или на дверь. Чичиков еще раз взглянул на него искоса, когда проходили они столовую: медведь! совершенный медведь! Нужно же такое странное сближение: его даже звали Михайлом Семеновичем. Зная привычку его наступать на ноги, он очень осторожно передвигал своими и давал ему дорогу вперед. Хозяин, казалось, сам чувствовал за собою этот грех и тот же час спросил: «Не побеспокоил ли я вас?» Но Чичиков поблагодарил, сказав, что еще не произошло никакого беспокойства.","When Chichikov glanced askance at Sobakevich, this time he seemed to him very much like a medium-sized bear. To complete the resemblance, his tailcoat was completely bear-colored, the sleeves were long, the pantaloons were long, he stepped with his feet and at random and stepped incessantly on other people's legs. The complexion was red-hot, hot, which happens on a copper penny. It is known that there are many such persons in the world, over the finishing of which nature did not think long, did not use any small tools, such as files, gimlets and other things, but simply chopped from her shoulder: she grabbed with an ax once - her nose came out, she had enough in another - her lips came out, she poked her eyes with a large drill and, without scraping, let them into the light, saying: “He lives!” Sobakevich had the same strong and marvelously stitched image: he held him more down than up, did not turn his neck at all, and because of this non-rotation he rarely looked at the one with whom he spoke, but always either at the corner of the stove or at the door. . Chichikov glanced sideways at him once more as they passed through the dining-room: a bear! perfect bear! Such a strange rapprochement is needed: he was even called Mikhail Semenovich. Knowing his habit of stepping on his feet, he very carefully moved his own and gave him the way forward. The owner, it seemed, himself felt this sin behind him, and at the same time asked: “Have I disturbed you?” But Chichikov thanked him, saying that there had not yet been any disturbance.","When Tchitchikov stole a sidelong glance at Sobakevitch, he struck him on this occasion as being extremely like a middle-sized bear. To complete the resemblance his dress coat was precisely the colour of a bear’s skin, his sleeves were long, his trousers were long, he ambled from side to side as he walked and was continually treading on other people’s feet. His face was burnt as dark red as a copper penny. We all know that there are a great many faces in the world, over the carving of which nature has spent no great pains, has used no delicate tools such as files or gimlets, but has simply rough-hewn them with a swing of the arm: one stroke of the axe and there’s a nose, another and there are the lips, the eyes are bored with a great drill, and without polishing it off, nature thrusts it into the world, saying, “This will do.” Just such an uncouth and strangely-hewn countenance was that of Sobakevitch: he held it rather drooping than erect, he did not turn his neck at all, and in consequence of this immobility he rarely looked at the person to whom he was speaking but always stared away at the corner of the stove or at the door. Tchitchikov stole another glance at him as they reached the dining-room; he was a bear, a regular bear! To complete the strange resemblance, his name was actually Mihail Semyonovitch.... Knowing his habit of treading on people’s feet, Tchitchikov moved his own feet very cautiously and made way for him to go first. Apparently Sobakevitch was aware of this failing and at once asked whether he had caused him any inconvenience, but Tchitchikov thanked him and said that he had so far suffered no discomfort.","A covert glance at Sobakevitch showed our hero that his host exactly resembled a moderate-sized bear. To complete the resemblance, Sobakevitch’s long frockcoat and baggy trousers were of the precise colour of a bear’s hide, while, when shuffling across the floor, he made a criss-cross motion of the legs, and had, in addition, a constant habit of treading upon his companion’s toes. As for his face, it was of the warm, ardent tint of a piatok 23. Persons of this kind—persons to whose designing nature has devoted not much thought, and in the fashioning of whose frames she has used no instruments so delicate as a file or a gimlet and so forth—are not uncommon. Such persons she merely roughhews. One cut with a hatchet, and there results a nose; another such cut with a hatchet, and there materialises a pair of lips; two thrusts with a drill, and there issues a pair of eyes. Lastly, scorning to plane down the roughness, she sends out that person into the world, saying: “There is another live creature.” Sobakevitch was just such a ragged, curiously put together figure—though the above model would seem to have been followed more in his upper portion than in his lower. One result was that he seldom turned his head to look at the person with whom he was speaking, but, rather, directed his eyes towards, say, the stove corner or the doorway. As host and guest crossed the dining-room Chichikov directed a second glance at his companion. “He is a bear, and nothing but a bear,” he thought to himself. And, indeed, the strange comparison was inevitable. Incidentally, Sobakevitch’s Christian name and patronymic were Michael Semenovitch. Of his habit of treading upon other people’s toes Chichikov had become fully aware; wherefore he stepped cautiously, and, throughout, allowed his host to take the lead. As a matter of fact, Sobakevitch himself seemed conscious of his failing, for at intervals he would inquire: “I hope I have not hurt you?” and Chichikov, with a word of thanks, would reply that as yet he had sustained no injury.","When Chichikov glanced sidelong at Sobakevich, it seemed to him this time that he looked exactly like a medium-sized bear. To complete the resemblance, the tailcoat he was wearing was of a perfect bear color; his sleeves were long, his trousers were long, his feet shambled this way and that, constantly stepping on other people’s toes. His face was of a roasted, hot color, such as one sees on copper coins. It is well-known that there are many faces in the world over the finishing of which nature did not take much trouble, did not employ any fine tools such as files, gimlets, and so on, but simply hacked them out with round strokes: one chop—a nose appears; another chop— lips appear; eyes are scooped out with a big drill; and she lets it go into the world rough-hewn, saying: “Alive!” Of such strong and marvelous fashioning was the visage of Sobakevich: he held it rather more down than up, did not swivel his neck at all, and, on account of this non-swiveling, rarely looked at the person he was speaking to, but always either at the corner of the stove or at the door. Chichikov gave him one more sidelong glance as they were going through the dining room: a bear! a veritable bear! If there were any need for such strange approximation, he was even named Mikhailo Semyonovich.19 Knowing his habit of stepping on people’s toes, he himself stepped very carefully and let him go ahead. The host seemed sensible of this failing himself, and at once asked him: “Have I inconvenienced you?” But Chichikov thanked him, saying that so far he had suffered no inconvenience.","This time, as Chichikov glanced at Sobakevich out of the corner of his eye, he looked to him very much like a bear of medium size. To complete the resemblance, the frock coat he was wearing was absolutely the color of a bear’s pelt; the sleeves were long, the trousers were long, he set his feet down lumberingly, this way and that way, and was forever stepping upon the feet of others. His face was a red-hot, fiery color, the ruddy color you find on a five-kopeck copper. As everyone knows, there are many such faces in this world, over the finishing of which Nature did not spend much thought or ingenuity, on which she did not use any small, delicate tools such as fine files, fine gimlets, and so forth, but simply hacked away with a full swing of the arm: one swipe of the ax, and there’s the nose for you; another swipe, and there are the lips; with a great auger she gouged out the eyes, and, without wasting any time on trimming and finishing, she let her handiwork out into the world, saying: “It lives!” Just such a sturdy and wondrously roughhewn countenance did Sobakevich have; he kept it down for the most part, rather than looking up; he hardly turned his neck and, because of this unwieldiness, looked but rarely at whomever he was speaking to, but always either at an angle of the stove or at the door. Chichikov glanced at him once more out of the corner of his eye, as they were passing into the dining room: a bear! A perfect bear! And, as the last, inevitable, needed touch to round out so strange an affinity, his very name was actually Mikhail Semionovich… 2 Knowing his way of stepping on the feet of others, Chichikov placed his own very carefully and allowed him to go ahead. The host himself, apparently, felt conscious of this failing and immediately inquired: “I haven’t inconvenienced you, have I?” But Chichikov thanked him, saying that no inconvenience had yet occurred."

Я бы очень желал не так живо чувствовать и не так близко принимать к сердцу все, что ни случается.","“I'm beginning to think, Plato, that the journey might indeed stir you up.

At present you are in a condition of mental slumber. You have fallen asleep, not so much from weariness or satiety, as through a lack of vivid perceptions and impressions.

"— Хорошо, а тебе привезу барабан. Такой славный барабан, этак все будет: туррр… ру… тра-та-та, та-та-та… Прощай, душенька! прощай! — Тут поцеловал он его в голову и обратился к Манилову и его супруге с небольшим смехом, с какие обыкновенно обращаются к родителям, давая им знать о невинности желаний их детей.","- Okay, I'll bring you a drum. Such a glorious drum, so everything will be: turrr ... ru ... tra-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta ...

Then a drum it shall be—SUCH a beautiful drum! What a tur-r-r-ru-ing and a tra-ta-ta-ta-ing you will be able to kick up! Farewell, my darling.” And, kissing the boy’s head, he turned to Manilov and Madame with the slight smile which one assumes before assuring parents of the guileless merits of their offspring.","“Fine, I’ll bring you a drum. A real nice drum, it’ll go like this: turrr … ru … tra-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta … Good-bye, sweetie, goodbye!” Here he kissed him on the head and turned to Manilov and his spouse with a little laugh, such as one commonly addresses to parents in letting them know the innocence of their children’s wishes.","“Very well, I’ll bring you a drum, and what a glorious drum! It will always be beating boom-boom! Boom-boom-bang! . . . Good-bye, my little pet—Good-bye!” Whereupon he kissed the boy’s head and turned to Manilov and his spouse with restrained laughter, such as is always turned on for the benefit of parents, thus letting them in on how innocent the desires of their children are."

That will mean a sheer loss to me, for nowhere else in the world could you buy better souls than mine.”","“Well, if you please, I’ll also give you my final word: fifty roubles!

"— Прощайте, миленькие малютки! — сказал Чичиков, увидевши Алкида и Фемистоклюса, которые занимались каким-то деревянным гусаром, у которого уже не было ни руки, ни носа. — Прощайте, мои крошки.

I will bring you a sword; would you like a sword?”","With that the party moved into the drawing-room. “Farewell, dearest children,” Chichikov went on as he caught sight of Alkid and Themistocleus, who were playing with a wooden hussar which lacked both a nose and one arm. “Farewell, dearest pets. Pardon me for having brought you no presents, but, to tell you the truth, I was not, until my visit, aware of your existence.

You would like that, would you not?”","“Good-bye, dear little ones!” said Chichikov, seeing Alkides and Themistoclus, who were occupied with some wooden hussar that already lacked an arm and a nose. “Good-bye, my tots.

"Старый, обширный, тянувшийся позади дома сад, выходивший за село и потом пропадавший в поле, заросший и заглохлый, казалось, один освежал эту обширную деревню и один был вполне живописен в своем картинном опустении. Зелеными облаками и неправильными трепетолистными куполами лежали на небесном горизонте соединенные вершины разросшихся на свободе дерев. Белый колоссальный ствол березы, лишенный верхушки, отломленной бурею или грозою, подымался из этой зеленой гущи и круглился на воздухе, как правильная мраморная сверкающая колонна; косой остроконечный излом его, которым он оканчивался кверху вместо капители, темнел на снежной белизне его, как шапка или черная птица. Хмель, глушивший внизу кусты бузины, рябины и лесного орешника и пробежавший потом по верхушке всего частокола, взбегал наконец вверх и обвивал до половины сломленную березу. Достигнув середины ее, он оттуда свешивался вниз и начинал уже цеплять вершины других дерев или же висел на воздухе, завязавши кольцами свои тонкие цепкие крючья, легко колеблемые воздухом. Местами расходились зеленые чащи, озаренные солнцем, и показывали неосвещенное между них углубление, зиявшее, как темная пасть; оно было окинуто тенью, и чуть-чуть мелькали в черной глубине его: бежавшая узкая дорожка, обрушенные перилы, пошатнувшаяся беседка, дуплистый дряхлый ствол ивы, седой чапыжник,[13] густой щетиною вытыкавший из-за ивы иссохшие от страшной глушины, перепутавшиеся и скрестившиеся листья и сучья, и, наконец, молодая ветвь клена, протянувшая сбоку свои зеленые лапы-листы, под один из которых забравшись бог весть каким образом, солнце превращало его вдруг в прозрачный и огненный, чудно сиявший в этой густой темноте. В стороне, у самого края сада, несколько высокорослых, не вровень другим, осин подымали огромные вороньи гнезда на трепетные свои вершины. У иных из них отдернутые и не вполне отделенные ветви висели вниз вместе с иссохшими листьями. Словом, все было хорошо, как не выдумать ни природе, ни искусству, но как бывает только тогда, когда они соединятся вместе, когда по нагроможденному, часто без толку, труду человека пройдет окончательным резцом своим природа, облегчит тяжелые массы, уничтожит грубоощутительную правильность и нищенские прорехи, сквозь которые проглядывает нескрытый, нагой план, и даст чудную теплоту всему, что создалось в хладе размеренной чистоты и опрятности.","The old, vast garden stretching behind the house, overlooking the village and then disappearing into the field, overgrown and decayed, it seemed that alone refreshed this vast village and alone was quite picturesque in its picturesque desolation. Green clouds and irregular quivering domes lay on the celestial horizon, the connected tops of trees that had grown in freedom. A colossal white birch trunk, devoid of a top broken off by a storm or a thunderstorm, rose from this green thicket and rounded in the air, like a regular marble sparkling column; its oblique pointed break, with which it ended upward instead of a capital, darkened against its snowy whiteness, like a hat or a black bird. The hops, which choked the bushes of elderberry, mountain ash, and hazel below, and then ran along the top of the entire palisade, finally ran up and twisted halfway around the broken birch. Having reached the middle of it, it hung down from there and already began to cling to the tops of other trees, or hung in the air, tying its thin tenacious hooks in rings, easily shaken by the air. In places, green thickets diverge, illuminated by the sun, and show an unlit depression between them, gaping like a dark mouth; it was shrouded in shadow, and barely flickered in its black depths: a running narrow path, a collapsed railing, a staggering arbor, a hollow, decrepit trunk of a willow, a gray-haired chapyzhnik, crossed leaves and twigs, and, finally, a young branch of a maple, stretching its green paws-leaves to the side, under one of which, climbing God knows how, the sun suddenly turned it into a transparent and fiery one, shining wonderfully in this thick darkness. Away, at the very edge of the garden, a few tall aspens, not equal to the others, raised huge crows' nests to their quivering peaks. Some of them had upturned and not quite detached branches hanging down along with withered leaves. In a word, everything was fine, as neither nature nor art can invent, but as it happens only when they are united together, when, according to the piled up, often useless, labor of man, nature passes with its final cutter, lightens heavy masses, destroys grossly sensible correctness and beggarly gaps through which an unconcealed, naked plan peeps through, and will give wonderful warmth to everything that has been created in the coldness of measured cleanliness and tidiness.","The big overgrown and neglected old garden which stretched at the back of the house, and coming out behind the village, disappeared into the open country, seemed the one refreshing feature in the great rambling village, and in its picturesque wildness was the only beautiful thing in the place. The interlacing tops of the un pruned trees lay in clouds of greenery and irregular canopies of trembling foliage against the horizon. The colossal white trunk of a birch-tree, of which the crest had been snapped off by a gale or a tempest, rose out of this green maze and stood up like a round shining marble column; the sharp slanting angle, in which it ended instead of in a capital, looked dark against the snowy whiteness of the trunk, like a cap or a blackbird. A hop, after smothering bushes of elder, mountain-ash and hazel, and then running along the top of the whole palisade, finally darted upwards and twined round half of the broken birch-tree. After reaching the middle of it, it drooped down from it, caught on to the tops of other trees, or hung in the air, its festoons of delicate clinging tendrils faintly stirring in the breeze. Here and there, the green thicket, lighted up by the sun, parted and exposed the unlighted depths between them, yawning like a dark gulf. It was all plunged in shadow, and in its black depths there were faint glimpses of a narrow path, broken-down railings, a rickety arbour, a decaying willow stump full of holes, a grey-foliaged cara ganabp thrusting forward like a thick brush from behind the willow, leaves and twigs interlaced and crossing one another, withered from growing so terribly close, and a young branch of maple stretching sideways its claw-like leaves, under one of which the sun, somehow piercing its way, suddenly transformed it into a transparent, fiery hand, gleaming marvellously in that dense darkness. On one side, at the very edge of the garden, a few high-growing aspens above the level of the other trees lifted high into the air immense ravens’ nests upon their tremulous tops. From some of them, branches, twisted back but not yet broken off, hung downwards with their withered leaves. In short, it was all beautiful, as neither the work of nature nor that of art is alone, but as only happens when they work together, when nature’s chisel gives the final touches to the often unintelligent clumsy work of man, relieves the heavy masses, obliterates the crudely conceived symmetry, the bare gaps through which the plan is too nakedly apparent, and gives a marvellous warmth to all that has been created in the frigid stiffness of calculated neatness and accuracy.","It would seem as though the inhabitants themselves had removed the laths and traverses, on the very natural plea that the huts were no protection against the rain, and therefore, since the latter entered in bucketfuls, there was no particular object to be gained by sitting in such huts when all the time there was the tavern and the highroad and other places to resort to.","A vast, old garden stretching behind the house, extending beyond the village and then disappearing in the fields, overgrown and overrun, alone seemed to refresh this vast estate and alone was fully picturesque in its scenic devastation. In green clouds and irregular, leaf-fluttering cupolas against the sky’s horizon lay the joined tops of the freely branching trees. The colossal white trunk of a birch, deprived of its crown, broken off in a tempest or thunderstorm, rose out of this green thickness and rounded in the air like a regular, gleaming marble column; the sharp, slanting break that topped it instead of a capital showed dark against its snowy whiteness, like a hat or a black bird. Wild hops, smothering the elder, mountain ash, and hazel bushes underneath and then running over the top of the whole thicket, finally raced upwards, twining around half the length of the broken birch. Having reached the middle, it hung down from there and began to catch at the tops of other trees or else dangled in air, tying its thin, grasping hooks into rings, swayed lightly by the air. In places the green thickets, lit by the sun, parted and revealed an unlit gap between them, yawning like a dark maw; it was all shrouded in shadow, and in its dark depths there barely flashed a running, narrow path, a collapsed railing, a rickety gazebo, the hollowed, decrepit trunk of a willow, a hoary hawthorn sticking out from behind the willow in a dense stubble of tangled and intertwined leaves and branches, withered in that terrible occlusion, and, finally, a young maple bough, stretching from the side its green pawlike leaves, one of them suddenly transformed by the sun, which got under it God knows how, into something transparent and fiery, shining wondrously in that dense darkness. To one side, at the very edge of the garden, several tall aspens, grown beyond the level of the rest, lifted up huge crows’ nests on their fluttering tops. From some of them, broken but not quite sundered branches hung down with their withered leaves. In short, it was all just right, as neither nature nor art can contrive, but as only occurs when they join together, when, after the heaped-up, often senseless, labors of men, nature makes a finishing pass with her chisel, lightening the heavy masses, removing the crude-feeling regularity and indigent gaps through which the bare, undisguised plan peeps out, and imparts a wondrous warmth to all that was created in coldly measured cleanness and neatness.","The old, vast garden, stretching away behind the house, extending beyond the settlement and then losing itself in an open field, a garden gone wild, overgrown and stifled with weeds, was the only thing that lent a fresh air to the widely scattered settlement and the only thing that was fully picturesque in its pictorial desolation. The joined summits of trees that had attained their full growth in freedom lay in green clouds and irregular cupolas of trembling foliage against the skyline. The colossal white trunk of a birch that had been deprived of its crest by some tempest or thunderstorm rose up out of this thick green tangle and, high in the air, looked like a round, regular column of dazzling marble; the oblique, sharply pointed fracture in which it terminated in lieu of a capital showed darkly against its snowy whiteness, like a cap or some black-plumed bird. The hopvines that stifled the elder, rowan, and hazel bushes below and then ran all over the tops of the paling, at last darted halfway up the broken birch and entwined it. After reaching its middle, the vine hung down from there and was already beginning to catch at the tips of other trees or else dangled in the air, its slender, clinging tendrils curled into rings and lightly swaying in the breeze. In places the green, sunlit thickets parted and revealed some depression in their midst, sunless and gaping like a dark maw; it would be all enveloped in shadow and one could barely, barely glimpse in its dark depths a narrow path running through it; fallen railings; a rickety arbor; the hollow, decayed trunk of a willow; a hoary Siberian pea tree that stuck out from behind the willow its thick, bristling tangle and crisscross of twigs and leaves, dried and dead because of the fearful underwoods; and, finally, a young maple branch, extending from one side its green paws of leaves. Getting under one of these leaves, God alone knows how, the sun would suddenly transform it into a thing of transparency and fire that shone wondrously amid this dense darkness. Off to one side, at the very edge of the garden, a few tall aspens, rising above their fellows, lifted high into the air the enormous raven nests upon their quivering summits. Some of these aspens had branches broken but not completely severed, which dangled, their leaves all withered. In short, everything was as beautiful as neither Nature alone nor art alone can conceive, but as can only be produced when they come together, when over the labor of man, often heaped up without any sense, Nature will run her conclusive burin, will lighten the heavy masses, will do away with the coarsely palpable regularity and the beggar’s rents through which the unconcealed, naked plan peers, and bestow a wondrous warmth on everything that had been created amid the frigidity of a measured purity and tidiness."

"Он вступил в темные широкие сени, от которых подуло холодом, как из погреба. Из сеней он попал в комнату, тоже темную, чуть-чуть озаренную светом, выходившим из-под широкой щели, находившейся внизу двери. Отворивши эту дверь, он наконец очутился в свету и был поражен представшим беспорядком. Казалось, как будто в доме происходило мытье полов и сюда на время нагромоздили всю мебель. На одном столе стоял даже сломанный стул, и рядом с ним часы с остановившимся маятником, к которому паук уже приладил паутину. Тут же стоял прислоненный боков к стене шкаф с старинным серебром, графинчиками и китайским фарфором. На бюро, выложенном перламутною мозаикой, которая местами уже выпала и оставила после себя одни желтенькие желобки, наполненные клеем, лежало множества всякой всячины: куча исписанных мелко бумажек, накрытых мраморным позеленевшим прессом с яичком наверху, какая-то старинная книга в кожаном переплете с красным обрезом, лимон, весь высохший, ростом не более лесного ореха, отломленная ручка кресел, рюмка с какою-то жидкостью и тремя мухами, накрытая письмом, кусочек сургучика, кусочек где-то поднятой тряпки, два пера, запачканные чернилами, высохшие, как в чахотке, зубочистка, совершенно пожелтевшая, которою хозяин, может быть, ковырял в зубах своих еще до нашествия на Москву французов.","He stepped into the wide, dark hallway, from which a cold breeze blew, as from a cellar. From the passage he got into a room, also dark, slightly illuminated by light coming out from under a wide crack at the bottom of the door. Opening this door, he at last found himself in the light, and was struck by the disorder that presented itself. It seemed as if the floors were being washed in the house and all the furniture had been piled up here for a while. On one table there was even a broken chair, and next to it was a clock with a stopped pendulum, to which a spider had already attached a web. Right there, leaning against the wall, was a cupboard filled with antique silverware, decanters, and Chinese china. On the bureau, lined with mother-of-pearl mosaics, which had already fallen out in places and left behind only yellowish grooves filled with glue, lay a lot of all sorts of things: a pile of small papers covered with a greenish marble press with an egg on top, some old book bound in leather with red cut, a lemon, all dried up, not more than a hazelnut, a broken off armchair, a glass with some kind of liquid and three flies, covered with a letter, a piece of sealing wax, a piece of a rag raised somewhere, two feathers stained with ink, dried up, as in consumption, a toothpick, completely yellowed, with which the owner, perhaps, picked his teeth even before the French invasion of Moscow.","He stepped into a wide, dark hall, which struck as chill as a cellar. From the hall he went into a room, which was also dark, with a faint light coming from a big crack at the bottom of the door. Opening this door he found himself in the light, and was startled at the scene of disorder that met his eyes. It looked as though they were having a house-cleaning, and all the furniture were piled up in this room. There was even a broken chair standing on a table, and near it a clock with a stationary pendulum on which a spider had already spun a web. Close by stood a cupboard leaning sideways against the wall, with old-fashioned silver decanters and china in it. On the bureau, inlaid with a mosaic in mother-of-pearl, bits of which had fallen out, leaving yellow gaps filled with glue, lay a vast number of all sorts of things; a pile of closely written papers, covered with a marble egg-shaped paper-weight, green with age, and an old-fashioned book, bound in leather with a red pattern on it, a lemon shrivelled up to the size of a hazelnut, the arm of a broken easy-chair, a wineglass containing some liquid and three flies, covered with an envelope, a bit of sealing-wax, a rag that had been picked up somewhere, two pens crusted with ink, dried up as though in consumption, a toothpick yellow with age which the master might have used to pick his teeth with before the invasion of Russia by the French.bq","Entering a large, dark hall which reeked like a tomb, he passed into an equally dark parlour that was lighted only by such rays as contrived to filter through a crack under the door. When Chichikov opened the door in question, the spectacle of the untidiness within struck him almost with amazement. It would seem that the floor was never washed, and that the room was used as a receptacle for every conceivable kind of furniture. On a table stood a ragged chair, with, beside it, a clock minus a pendulum and covered all over with cobwebs. Against a wall leant a cupboard, full of old silver, glassware, and china. On a writing table, inlaid with mother-of-pearl which, in places, had broken away and left behind it a number of yellow grooves (stuffed with putty), lay a pile of finely written manuscript, an overturned marble press (turning green), an ancient book in a leather cover with red edges, a lemon dried and shrunken to the dimensions of a hazelnut, the broken arm of a chair, a tumbler containing the dregs of some liquid and three flies (the whole covered over with a sheet of notepaper), a pile of rags, two ink-encrusted pens, and a yellow toothpick with which the master of the house had picked his teeth (apparently) at least before the coming of the French to Moscow.","He stepped into the dark, wide front hall, from which cold air blew as from a cellar. From the hall he got into a room, also dark, faintly illumined by light coming through a wide crack under a door. Opening this door, he at last found himself in the light and was struck by the disorder that confronted him. It looked as if they were washing the floors in the house, and all the furniture had for the time being been piled up here. On one table there even stood a broken chair, and next to it a clock with a stopped pendulum to which a spider had already attached its web. Near it, leaning its side against the wall, stood a cupboard with old silver, decanters, and Chinese porcelain. On the bureau, inlaid with mother-of-pearl mosaic, which in places had fallen out and left only yellow grooves filled with glue, lay a various multitude of things: a stack of papers written all over in a small hand, covered by a marble paperweight, gone green, with a little egg on top of it, some ancient book in a leather binding with red edges, a completely dried-up lemon no bigger than a hazelnut, the broken-off arm of an armchair, a glass with some sort of liquid and three flies in it, covered by a letter, a little piece of sealing wax, a little piece of rag picked up somewhere, two ink-stained pens, dried up as if with consumption, a toothpick, turned completely yellow, with which the master had probably picked his teeth even before the invasion of Moscow by the French.26","Chichikov stepped into a dark, wide entry, out of which cold blew upon him as from a cellar. From the entry he found his way into another room that was likewise dark, very, very meagerly lit by a light that came through a broad crack below a door. Opening this door he at last found himself in the light and was struck by the disorder that appeared before his eyes. It seemed as if a general housecleaning were going on and all the furniture had been piled up here for the time being. There was even a broken chair standing on one of the tables and, side by side with it, a clock whose pendulum had stopped and to which a spider had already cunningly attached its web. Here, too, with one of its sides leaning against the wall, stood a dresser with antiquated silver, small carafes, and Chinese porcelain. Upon a bureau, with a marquetry of mother-of-pearl mosaic, which had already fallen out in places and left behind it only yellowish little grooves and depressions filled with crusted glue, was lying a great and bewildering omnium-gatherum: a mound of scraps of paper, closely covered with writing, pressed down with a paperweight of marble turned green and having an egg-shaped little knob; some sort of ancient tome in a leather binding and with red edges; a lemon, so dried up that it was no bigger than a hazelnut; a broken-off chair arm; a wine glass with some kind of liquid and three dead flies, covered over with a letter; a bit of sealing wax; a bit of rag picked up somewhere; two quills, dirty with ink and as dried out as consumptives; a toothpick, perfectly yellowed, which its owner had probably been picking his teeth with even before Moscow had been invaded by the French."
"Чичиков объяснил ей, что эта бумага не такого рода, что она назначена для совершения крепостей, а не для просьб. Впрочем, чтобы успокоить ее, он дал ей какой-то лист в рубль ценою. Написавши письмо, дал он ей подписаться и попросил маленький списочек мужиков. Оказалось, что помещица не вела никаких записок, ни списков, а знала почти всех наизусть; он заставил ее тут же продиктовать их. Некоторые крестьяне несколько изумили его своими фамилиями, а еще более прозвищами, так что он всякий раз, слыша их, прежде останавливался, а потом уже начинал писать. Особенно поразил его какой-то Петр Савельев Неуважай-Корыто, так что он не мог не сказать: «Экой длинный!» Другой имел прицепленный к имени «Коровий кирпич», иной оказался просто: Колесо Иван. Оканчивая писать, он потянул несколько к себе носом воздух и услышал завлекательный запах чего-то горячего в масле.","Chichikov explained to her that this paper was not of this kind, that it was intended for making fortresses, and not for requests. However, in order to calm her down, he gave her a piece of paper worth a ruble. Having written the letter, he gave her to sign and asked for a small list of peasants. It turned out that the landowner did not keep any notes or lists, but knew almost everyone by heart; he made her promptly dictate them. Some peasants somewhat amazed him with their surnames, and even more so with their nicknames, so that every time he heard them, he would first stop and then begin to write. He was especially struck by some Pyotr Savelyev Disrespect-Trough, so that he could not help but say: “What a long one!” Another had a ""Cow brick"" attached to the name, the other turned out to be simply: Wheel Ivan. As he finished writing, he sniffed the air a little with his nose and heard the enticing smell of something hot in the oil.","Tchitchikov explained to her that the paper was not the right sort for that, that it was meant for drawing up deeds of purchase and not for petitions. To satisfy her, however, he gave her a sheet worth a rouble. After writing the letter he gave it to her to sign and asked her for a little list of the peasants. It appeared that the old lady kept no lists or records, but knew them all by heart. He made her dictate their names to him. He was astonished at some of the peasants’ surnames and still more at their nicknames, so much so that he paused on hearing them before beginning to write. He was particularly struck by one Pyotr Savelyev Ne-uvazhay-Koryto (Never mind the Trough), so that he could not help saying: “What a long name.” Another had attached to his name Korovy-Kirpitch (Cow’s Brick), another simply appeared as Ivan Koleso (Wheel). When he had finished writing he drew in the air through his nose and sniffed a seductive fragrance of something fried in butter.","Upon this Chichikov explained that the paper was not the sort proper for the purpose—that it was meant for serf-indenturing, and not for the framing of pleas. Nevertheless, to quiet her, he gave her a sheet stamped to the value of a rouble. Next, he handed her the letter to sign, and requested, in return, a list of her peasants. Unfortunately, such a list had never been compiled, let alone any copies of it, and the only way in which she knew the peasants’ names was by heart. However, he told her to dictate them. Some of the names greatly astonished our hero, so, still more, did the surnames. Indeed, frequently, on hearing the latter, he had to pause before writing them down. Especially did he halt before a certain “Peter Saveliev Neuvazhai Korito.” “What a string of titles!” involuntarily he ejaculated. To the Christian name of another serf was appended “Korovi Kirpitch,” and to that of a third “Koleso Ivan.” However, at length the list was compiled, and he caught a deep breath; which latter proceeding caused him to catch also the attractive odour of something fried in fat.","Chichikov explained to her that this was the wrong kind of paper, that it was for drawing up deeds, not for petitions. However, to quiet her down he gave her some sheet worth a rouble. Having written the letter, he gave it to her to sign and asked for a little list of the muzhiks. It turned out that the lady landowner did not keep any records or lists, but knew almost everyone by heart; he straightaway had her dictate them to him. Some of the peasants amazed him a bit with their last names, and still more with their nicknames, so that each time, on hearing one, he would pause first and only then begin to write. He was especially struck by a certain Pyotr Saveliev Disrespect-Trough, so that he could not help saying: “My, that’s a long one!” Another had “Cow’s Brick” hitched to his name, still another turned out to be simply: Wheel, Ivan. As he finished writing, he drew in air slightly through his nose and sensed the enticing smell of something hot in butter.","Chichikov explained to her that this paper was not of that sort; it was intended for the execution of purchase deeds and not for petitions. However, in order to pacify her, he gave her some sheet or other with a ruble stamp on it. Having written the letter, he gave it to her to sign and asked for a short list of the dead serfs. It turned out that this landed proprietress kept neither records nor lists of any kind whatsoever, but she did know the names of almost all her serfs by heart. He made her dictate these to him right then and there. Certain of the peasants amazed him by their family names, but still more by their nicknames, so that every time he heard them called out he had to pause before writing them down. He was especially struck by a certain Petr Saveliev Neuvazhai Koryto (No-Respect-for-the-Pig-Trough), so that he could not help saying: “What a long name!” Another had appended to his name Korovii Kirpich (Cow-Dung Brick); there was one who turned out to be simply Koleso Ivan (John the Wheel). As he was finishing his writing, he sniffed the air slightly and caught the enticing aroma of something hot, made with butter."

"Иван Антонович как будто бы и не слыхал и углубился совершенно в бумаги, не отвечая ничего. Видно было вдруг, что это был уже человек благоразумных лет, не то что молодой болтун и вертопляс. Иван Антонович, казалось, имел уже далеко за сорок лет; волос на нем был черный, густой; вся середина лица выступала у него вперед и пошла в нос, — словом, это было то лицо, которое называют в общежитье кувшинным рылом.","Ivan Antonovich did not seem to have heard, and was completely absorbed in the papers without answering anything. It was suddenly clear that he was already a man of prudent years, not like a young chatterbox and a helicopter dancer. Ivan Antonovich seemed to be well over forty years old; his hair was black and thick; the whole middle of his face protruded forward and went into his nose - in a word, it was that face that is called in the hostel a jug snout.","Ivan Antonovitch appeared not to hear the question and became absolutely buried in his papers, making no response whatever. It could be seen at once that he was a man of reasonable years, very different from a young chatterbox and featherhead.

Instantly it became plain that HE at least was of an age of discretion, and not one of your jejune chatterboxes and harum-scarums; for, although his hair was still thick and black, he had long ago passed his fortieth year.

"Уже известно, что Чичиков сильно заботился о своих потомках. Такой чувствительный предмет! Иной, может быть, и не так бы глубоко запустил руку, если бы не вопрос, который, неизвестно почему, приходит сам собою: а что скажут дети? И вот будущий родоначальник, как осторожный кот, покося только одним глазом вбок, не глядит ли откуда хозяин, хватает поспешно все, что к нему поближе: мыло ли стоит, свечи ли, сало, канарейка ли попалась под лапу — словом, не пропускает ничего. Так жаловался и плакал герой наш, а между тем деятельность никак не умирала в голове его; там все хотело что-то строиться и ждало только плана. Вновь съежился он, вновь принялся вести трудную жизнь, вновь ограничил себя во всем, вновь из чистоты и приличного положения опустился в грязь и низменную жизнь. И в ожидании лучшего принужден был даже заняться званием поверенного, званием, еще не приобретшим у нас гражданства, толкаемым со всех сторон, плоха уважаемым мелкою приказною тварью и даже самими доверителями, осужденным на пресмыканье в передних, грубости и прочее, но нужда заставила решиться на все. Из поручений досталось ему, между прочим, одно: похлопотать о заложении в опекунский совет нескольких сот крестьян. Имение было расстроено в последней степени. Расстроено оно было скотскими падежами, плутами приказчиками, неурожаями, повальными болезнями, истребившими лучших работников, и, наконец, бестолковьем самого помещика, убиравшего себе в Москве дом в последнем вкусе и убившего на эту уборку все состояние свое до последней копейки, так что уж не на что было есть. По этой-то причине понадобилось наконец заложить последнее оставшееся имение. Заклад в казну был тогда еще дело новое, на которое решались не без страха. Чичиков в качестве поверенного, прежде расположивши всех (без предварительного расположения, как известно, не может быть даже взята простая справка или выправка, все же хоть по бутылке мадеры придется влить во всякую глотку), — итак, расположивши всех, кого следует, объяснил он, что вот какое, между прочим, обстоятельство: половина крестьян вымерла, так чтобы не было каких-нибудь потом привязок…","It is already known that Chichikov took great care of his descendants. Such a sensitive subject! Another, perhaps, would not have sunk his hand so deeply if it were not for the question that, for some unknown reason, comes by itself: what will the children say? And now the future ancestor, like a cautious cat, squinting with only one eye to the side, whether the owner is looking from where, hastily grabs everything that is closer to him: is it worth soap, is it candles, lard, is the canary caught under its paw - in a word, does not miss anything . This is how our hero complained and wept, but meanwhile activity did not die in his head; there everything wanted to build something and waited only for the plan. Again he shrank, again began to lead a difficult life, again limited himself in everything, again from purity and decent position he sank into dirt and low life. And in anticipation of a better one, I was even forced to take up the title of attorney, a title that had not yet acquired citizenship from us, pushed from all sides, poorly respected by petty clerks and even by the trustees themselves, condemned to crouching in front, rudeness, etc., but the need forced me to decide on all. Of the orders he got, by the way, one thing: to petition for the placement of several hundred peasants in the board of trustees. The estate was ruined to the last degree. It was upset by bestial cases, rogue clerks, crop failures, epidemic diseases that destroyed the best workers, and, finally, the stupidity of the landowner himself, who cleaned his house in Moscow in the last taste and killed his entire fortune to the last penny for this cleaning, so that he no longer what was there. For this reason, it was finally necessary to mortgage the last remaining estate. Mortgage to the treasury was then still a new matter, which was decided not without fear. Chichikov as an attorney, having first arranged everyone (without a preliminary arrangement, as you know, even a simple certificate or correction cannot be taken, nevertheless, at least a bottle of Madeira will have to be poured into every throat), - so, having located everyone who should be, he explained that, by the way, this is a circumstance: half of the peasants died out, so that there would be no bindings later ...","As the reader is already aware, Tchitchikov was much troubled about his descendants. It was such a touching subject! He would not have set to work so vigorously if it had not been for the question, which for some unknown reason spontaneously occurred to him: “What will my children say?” And so our future founder of a family was like a cautious tomcat who, looking out of the corner of one eye to see whether his master is watching him from somewhere, hurriedly grabs whatever is nearest to him: soap, candles, salt pork, or a canary if he can get it in his claws, in fact, lets nothing escape him. So our hero wept and lamented, but meanwhile his active brain did not flag; there everything was longing to build up something and only waiting for a plan. Once more he drew himself in, once more he began to lead a hard life, once more restricted himself in every way, once more from an elegant decorous existence sank into degradation and low life. And while waiting for better times he was even obliged to adopt the calling of a legal agent, a calling which is not recognised as creditable among us, he was jostled out of the way on all sides, treated with scant respect by all the small fry of the attorneys’ offices, and even by those who employed him, doomed to cool his heels hanging about in entries, to put up with rudeness and so on, but poverty forced him to accept anything. Among the jobs he got was one to arrange for the mortgaging of several hundred of peasants to the Trustee Committee. The estate on which they existed was hopelessly ruined. It had been ruined by the cattle plague, rascally stewards, bad harvests, infectious diseases, which carried off the best of the workmen, and lastly the folly of the landowner himself, who had furnished a house for himself in Moscow in the latest fashion, and wasted upon this the whole of his property to the last kopeck, so that he had literally nothing to eat. At last the only thing left to do was to mortgage his last remaining estate. Mortgaging to the government was at that time a new scheme and people resorted to it with some uneasiness. Tchitchikov acting as agent, after first propitiating every one (as we all know, without a preliminary consideration no one can obtain a simple piece of information or verification, at least a bottle of Madeira must be poured down every throat) and so after propitiating every one concerned, he pointed out one circumstance—that half the peasants had died—in order that there might be no difficulties made afterwards....","Here I may remark that we have seen how much thought Chichikov devoted to his future descendants. Indeed, had not there been constantly recurring to his mind the insistent question, “ What will my children say?” he might not have plunged into the affair so deeply. Nevertheless, like a wary cat which glances hither and thither to see whether its mistress be not coming before it can make off with whatsoever first falls to its paw (butter, fat, lard, a duck, or anything else), so our future founder of a family continued, though weeping and bewailing his lot, to let not a single detail escape his eye. That is to say, he retained his wits ever in a state of activity, and kept his brain constantly working. All that he required was a plan. Once more he pulled himself together, once more he embarked upon a life of toil, once more he stinted himself in everything, once more he left clean and decent surroundings for a dirty, mean existence. In other words, until something better should turn up, he embraced the calling of an ordinary attorney—a calling which, not then possessed of a civic status, was jostled on very side, enjoyed little respect at the hands of the minor legal fry (or, indeed, at its own), and perforce met with universal slights and rudeness. But sheer necessity compelled Chichikov to face these things. Among commissions entrusted to him was that of placing in the hands of the Public Trustee several hundred peasants who belonged to a ruined estate. The estate had reached its parlous condition through cattle disease, through rascally bailiffs, through failures of the harvest, through such epidemic diseases that had killed off the best workmen, and, last, but not least, through the senseless conduct of the owner himself, who had furnished a house in Moscow in the latest style, and then squandered his every kopeck, so that nothing was left for his further maintenance, and it became necessary to mortgage the remains—including the peasants—of the estate. In those days mortgage to the Treasury was an innovation looked upon with reserve, and, as attorney in the matter, Chichikov had first of all to “entertain” every official concerned (we know that, unless that be previously done, unless a whole bottle of madeira first be emptied down each clerical throat, not the smallest legal affair can be carried through), and to explain, for the barring of future attachments, that half of the peasants were dead.","It is already known that Chichikov was greatly concerned with his posterity. Such a sensitive subject! A man would, perhaps, not be so light of finger, were it not for the question which, no one knows why, comes of itself: “And what will the children say?” And so the future progenitor, like a cautious cat casting a sidelong glance with one eye to make sure his master is not watching, hastily grabs everything close to him—soap, a candle, lard, a canary that turns up under his paw—in short, he does not miss a thing. So our hero complained and wept, and meanwhile the activity in his head refused to die; it was all concentrated on building something and only waited for a plan. Again he shrank, again he began to lead a hard life, again limited himself in everything, again sank from cleanliness and a decent situation into mire and low life. And, in expectation of better things, was even forced to occupy himself with the calling of solicitor, a calling which has not yet acquired citizenship among us, is pushed around on all sides, is little respected by petty clerkdom, or even by the clients themselves, which is condemned to groveling in hallways, to rudeness, and all the rest of it, but need made him resolve on it all. Among other cases there was one in which he had to solicit for the taking in custody of several hundred peasants. The estate was in the last degree of disorder. The disorder had been caused by loss of cattle, swindling stewards, bad crops, epidemic diseases that killed off the best workers, and finally by the witlessness of the landowner himself, who was decorating his Moscow house in the newest taste and in the process destroying his entire fortune to the last kopeck, so that there was no longer enough to eat. And this was the reason why it was finally necessary to mortgage what remained of the estate. Mortgaging to the treasury was a new thing then, which was not ventured upon without fear. As a solicitor, Chichikov, having first gained everyone’s favor (without gaining favor beforehand, as we all know, even the simplest document or certificate cannot be obtained; a bottle of Madeira must at least be poured down every gullet)—and so, having gained the favor of everyone he needed, he explained that there was, incidentally, this circumstance, that half the peasants had died off—just so there should be no quibbling later on …","As we already know, Chichikov was mightily solicitous about his descendants. What a touching subject! Here and there, perchance, one could come upon a man who perhaps mightn’t plunge his arm quite so far into the grab bag were it not for the question which, no one knows why, bobs up of itself: “But what will my children say?” And so the future founder of a line, like a cautious tomcat, looking out of the corner of only one of his eyes to see if the master isn’t watching from somewhere, hastily grabs at anything that’s nearest him, whether it happens to be a piece of soap, or tallow candles, or lard, or a canary—in a word, whatever he can put his paws on; he won’t let anything get by him. Thus did our hero complain and weep, yet at the same time enterprise did not die out in his head; everything there somehow longed constantly to be a-building and merely waited for a plan. Anew he curled up into a ball, like a hedgehog; anew he undertook to lead a hard life; anew he limited himself in all things; anew, out of cleanliness and a decent position in society, he came down into muck and a lowly life. And, while waiting for something better to turn up, he was actually forced to follow the calling of a legal agent, a calling whose followers have not yet won a status among us, being jostled on all sides, poorly respected by petty clerical creatures and even by the principals themselves, condemned to crawling and cooling their heels in anterooms, to rudeness and the like; but necessity compelled him to venture on anything and everything. There was one commission that came his way, among others: to see about mortgaging several hundred serfs in the Tutelary Chamber.2 The estate was in the last stage of disorganization. It had been disorganized by a plague among the cattle, by knavish stewards, poor crops, epidemics that had killed off the best workers, and, finally by the lack of common sense in the landowner himself, who had decorated a house for himself in Moscow in the latest style, and who for the sake of this decoration had drained the life out of his estate, squeezing out the last copper, so that by this time he actually had no money for food. For this very reason the necessity arose, at last, of mortgaging the last remaining property, the serfs. This form of mortgaging, conducted by the government, was at that time still a new business, and people resorted to it not without apprehension. Chichikov, in his role of agent, having first predisposed everybody (without this preliminary of predisposing people one can’t, as everybody knows, make even a simple inquiry or verification—a bottle of Madeira must, no matter how trifling the transaction, be poured down each throat concerned)—having predisposed the proper people, Chichikov explained, among other things, the following circumstance: half the serfs had died off, and in order that there be no objections raised later on...."
"— Восемьдесят лет, ваше превосходительство. Но это келейное, я бы… чтобы… — Чичиков посмотрел значительно в лицо генерала и в то же время искоса на камердинера.","“Eighty years old, Your Excellency. But this is a cell room, I would ... so that ... - Chichikov looked significantly into the general's face and at the same time askance at the valet.","“Eighty, your Excellency. But it is a private matter. I should be ...” Tchitchikov looked significantly at the general, and at the same time glanced out of the corner of his eye at the valet.","“He is eighty, your Excellency.” “But still brisk and able to move about, eh?","“Eighty, Your Excellency. But this is in the closet, I’d … so that …” Chichikov gave a meaning look into the general’s face and at the same time a sidelong glance at the valet.",
"Чичиков глядел на него пристально и думал: «Что ж? с этим, кажется, чиниться нечего». Не отлагая дела в дальний ящик, он объяснил полковнику тут же, что так и так: имеется надобность вот в каких душах, с совершеньем таких-то крепостей.","Chichikov looked at him intently and thought: “Well? there doesn't seem to be anything to do with it."" Without putting things aside, he immediately explained to the colonel that this is how it is: there is a need for such and such souls, with the accomplishment of such and such fortresses.","Tchitchikov looked at him intently and thought: “Well, it’s no use standing on ceremony with him.” Without putting things off he informed the colonel on the spot that he was in need of certain souls with the completion of purchase and all the formalities.","For a while Chichikov listened with distended eyes. Then he felt constrained to intimate that with all that he had nothing to do, seeing that his business was merely to acquire a few souls, and thereafter to have their purchase confirmed.","Chichikov was looking at him intently, thinking: “Well, it seems there ’s no point in standing on ceremony with this one.” Not leaving matters in the bottom drawer, he straightaway explained to the colonel thus and so: there was a need for such and such souls, with the drawing up of such and such deeds.",
"— А что вам нужно? — сказали оба чиновника, оборотившись.","- What do you need? said both officials, turning around.","“Why, what do you want?” asked both the clerks, turning round.","“Of what nature, precisely, IS your business?” countered one of the youthful officials as he turned himself round.","“And what is it you want?” said both clerks, turning around.","“But just what is it you want?” both clerks asked, turning around."
"— Пошел, пошел, не болтай! — сказал Чичиков и про себя подумал: «В самом деле, напрасно я не догадался».","- Go, go, don't talk! said Chichikov, and thought to himself: ""Indeed, I shouldn't have guessed.""","“Get on, get on, don’t chatter,” said Tchitchikov, while he thought to himself, “Yes, it really is a pity I didn’t think of it.”","This said, Chichikov added to himself, smoothing his chin: “What a difference between the features of a civilised man of the world and those of a common lacquey!”","“Drive, drive, don’t babble!” Chichikov said, and thought to himself: “In fact, it’s too bad it never occurred to me.”",

"— Признаюсь, я тоже, — произнес Чичиков, — не могу понять, если позволите так заметить, не могу понять, как при такой наружности, как ваша, скучать. Конечно, могут быть причины другие: недостача денег, притеснения от каких-нибудь злоумышленников, как есть иногда такие, которые готовы покуситься даже на самую жизнь.","“I confess, I, too,” said Chichikov, “I can’t understand, if I may say so, I can’t understand how, with such an appearance as yours, one can be bored. Of course, there may be other reasons: lack of money, oppression from some intruders, as there are sometimes those who are ready to encroach even on life itself.","“I must confess,” Tchitchikov pronounced, “I too cannot understand how with an appearance like yours—if you will allow me to say so —you can be bored. Of course there may be other reasons—lack of money or vexations due to evil-minded persons, for indeed there are some such as are ready to attempt one’s life.”","“I, too, cannot understand,” remarked Chichikov, “how a man of your appearance can find things wearisome. Of course, if a man is hard pressed for money, or if he has enemies who are lying in wait for his life (as have certain folk of whom I know), well, then—”","“I confess,” Chichikov spoke, “I, too, cannot understand—if you will allow me the observation—cannot understand how it is possible, with an appearance such as yours, to be bored. Of course, there may be other reasons: lack of money, oppression from some sort of malefactors— for there exist such as are even ready to make an attempt on one’s life.”",
"— А ей-богу так! Ведь у меня что год, то бегают. Народ-то больно прожорлив, от праздности завел привычку трескать, а у меня есть и самому нечего… А уж я бы за них что ни дай взял бы.

After all, I have a year, then they run. The people are painfully gluttonous, from idleness they got into the habit of cracking, but I have nothing myself ... And I would take anything for them. So advise your friend something: if you find only a dozen, then he already has nice money. After all, the audit soul costs five hundred rubles.","“Yes, indeed! Not a year passes without some running away. They are a shockingly greedy lot, from idleness they have taken to drinking, while I have nothing to eat myself.... Really I would take anything I could get for them. So you might advise your friend: if he can only find one in ten, it will be all profit. You know a serf is worth fifty roubles.”","“Alas, yes. Never does a year pass without a certain number of them making off. Yet so gluttonous and idle are my serfs that they are simply bursting with food, whereas I scarcely get enough to eat. I will take any price for them that you may care to offer. Tell your friends about it, and, should they find even a score of the runaways, it will repay them handsomely, seeing that a living serf on the census list is at present worth five hundred roubles.”","“By God, it’s so! Every year someone runs away on me. These folk are mighty gluttons, got into the habit of stuffing themselves from idleness, and I myself have nothing to eat … So I’d take whatever I was given for them. You can advise your friend: if only a dozen get found, he’s already making good money. A registered soul is worth about five hundred roubles.”","“Yes, by God! Why, not a year passes but what some of them run off from me. My people are no end gluttonous; out of sheer idleness they’ve gotten into the habit of stuffing their guts, whereas I haven’t a thing to eat even myself. ... Yes, and I’d take anything you’d give me for them. So you just advise that friend of yours, now; if he should recapture but half a score souls he would already have a goodly sum. For, after all, a serf-soul registered with the Bureau of Audits is worth five hundred rubles.”"
"— Да, поздравляю вас: оборок более не носят.","- Yes, I congratulate you: frills are no longer worn.","Here the simply agreeable lady protested that it was not at all gaudy, and exclaimed: “Oh, I congratulate you, flounces are not to be worn.”","In other words, the ladies proceeded to indulge in a conversation on the subject of dress; and only after this had lasted for a considerable while did the visitor let fall a remark which led her entertainer to inquire:","“Besides, I congratulate you: flounces are no longer being worn.”","At this point the lady who was simply agreeable explained that it was not at all loud and then cried out: “Yes, allow me to congratulate you— flounces are no longer being worn.”"
"В первые дни Андрей Иванович опасался за свою независимость, чтобы как-нибудь гость не связал его, не стеснил какими-нибудь измененьями в образе жизни, и не разрушился бы порядок дня его, так удачно заведенный, — но опасенья были напрасны. Павел Иванович наш показал необыкновенно гибкую способность приспособиться ко всему. Одобрил философическую неторопливость хозяина, сказавши, что она обещает столетнюю жизнь. Об уединении выразился весьма счастливо — именно, что оно питает великие мысли в человеке. Взглянув на библиотеку и отозвавшись с похвалой о книгах вообще, заметил, что они спасают от праздности человека. Словом, выронил слов не много, но значительных. В поступках же своих поступал еще более кстати. Вовремя являлся, вовремя уходил; не затруднял хозяина запросами в часы неразговорчивости его; с удовольствием играл с ним в шахматы, с удовольствием молчал. В то время, когда один пускал кудреватыми облаками трубочный дым, другой, не куря трубки, придумывал, однако же, соответствовавшее тому занятие: вынимал, например, из кармана серебряную с чернью табакерку и, утвердив ее между двух пальцев левой руки, оборачивал ее быстро пальцем правой, в подобье того как земная сфера обращается около своей оси, или же просто барабанил по табакерке пальцами, насвистывая какое-нибудь ни то ни се. Словом, он не мешал хозяину никак. «Я в первый раз вижу человека, с которым можно жить, — говорил про себя Тентетников. — Вообще этого искусства у нас мало. Между нами есть довольно людей и умных, и образованных, и добрых, но людей постоянно приятных, людей постоянно ровного характера, людей, с которыми можно прожить век и не поссориться, — я не знаю, много ли у нас можно отыскать таких людей! Вот первый, единственный человек, которого я вижу!» Так отзывался Тентетников о своем госте.","In the early days, Andrei Ivanovich feared for his independence, lest the guest would somehow tie him up, constrain him with some changes in his way of life, and ruin the order of his day, so successfully established, but his fears were unfounded. Our Pavel Ivanovich showed an unusually flexible ability to adapt to everything. He approved of the owner's philosophical slowness, saying that it promised a hundred years of life. He expressed himself very happily about solitude - namely, that it nourishes great thoughts in a person. Glancing at the library and responding with praise about books in general, he noticed that they save a person from idleness. In a word, he dropped not many words, but significant ones. In his actions he acted even more appropriately. Appeared on time, left on time; did not bother the owner with requests during his hours of taciturnity; I enjoyed playing chess with him, I was pleased to keep quiet. At a time when one was blowing pipe smoke in curly clouds, the other, without smoking a pipe, however, came up with an activity corresponding to this: he took out, for example, a silver and black snuffbox from his pocket and, approving it between two fingers of his left hand, wrapped it quickly with his right finger, in the likeness of how the earthly sphere rotates about its axis, or he simply drummed on the snuffbox with his fingers, whistling some such and such. In a word, he did not interfere with the owner in any way. “For the first time I see a person with whom you can live,” Tentetnikov said to himself. “In general, we don’t have much of this art. There are quite a few people among us, both smart and educated, and kind, but people who are always pleasant, people who are always even-tempered, people with whom one can live a century without quarreling—I don’t know how many such people can be found among us! Here is the first, the only person I see!” This is how Tentetnikov spoke of his guest.","For the first few days Andrey Ivanovitch was apprehensive for his independence, fearing that the visitor might be a constraint and might involve changes in his manner of life, and might disturb the order of his day so satisfactorily established. But his apprehensions were groundless. The guest displayed an unusual capacity for adapting himself to everything. He applauded his host’s philosophical leisureliness, saying that it gave him promise of living to be a hundred. He expressed himself very felicitously about solitude, also saying that it fostered great ideas in a man. Glancing at the bookcase, he spoke with approval of books in general, observing that they preserved a man from idleness. In short, he dropped few words, but they were weighty ones. In his conduct he was even more tactful; appeared at the right minute and at the right minute retired; did not pester his host with questions when he was disinclined for conversation; was pleased to play chess with him, and was pleased to sit silent. While his host was puffing out tobacco smoke in curly clouds the visitor, who did not smoke, bethought himself of an occupation in keeping with it; he would for instance take his black and silver snuff box from out of his pocket, and holding it between two fingers of his left hand, twirl it round rapidly with one finger of his right hand, just as the terrestrial globe rotates on its own axis, or simply drummed upon it with his fingers, whistling some undefined tune. In short, he did not hinder his host in any way. “For the first time in my life I’ve met a man with whom I could live,” Tyentyetnikov said to himself. “As a rule that gift is rare amongst us. There are plenty of people among us, intelligent, cultured, good-natured, but people who are always agreeable, always good-tempered, people with whom one might live all one’s life without quarrelling, I don’t know whether many such people could be found in Russia! This is the first and only man I have seen.” So Tyentyetnikov characterised his visitor.","During the initial days of Chichikov’s sojourn, Tientietnikov feared rather to lose his independence, inasmuch as he thought that his guest might hamper his movements, and bring about alterations in the established routine of the place. But these fears proved groundless, for Paul Ivanovitch displayed an extraordinary aptitude for accommodating himself to his new position. To begin with, he encouraged his host in his philosophical inertia by saying that the latter would help Tientietnikov to become a centenarian. Next, in the matter of a life of isolation, he hit things off exactly by remarking that such a life bred in a man a capacity for high thinking. Lastly, as he inspected the library and dilated on books in general, he contrived an opportunity to observe that literature safeguarded a man from a tendency to waste his time. In short, the few words of which he delivered himself were brief, but invariably to the point. And this discretion of speech was outdone by his discretion of conduct. That is to say, whether entering or leaving the room, he never wearied his host with a question if Tientietnikov had the air of being disinclined to talk; and with equal satisfaction the guest could either play chess or hold his tongue. Consequently Tientietnikov said to himself: “For the first time in my life I have met with a man with whom it is possible to live. In general, not many of the type exist in Russia, and, though clever, good-humoured, well-educated men abound, one would be hard put to it to find an individual of equable temperament with whom one could share a roof for centuries without a quarrel arising. Anyway, Chichikov is the first of his sort that I have met.” For his part, Chichikov was only too delighted to reside with a person so quiet and agreeable as his host.","For the first few days Andrei Ivanovich feared for his independence, lest his guest somehow bind him, hinder him with some changes in his way of life, and the order of his day, so happily established, be violated—but his fears were in vain. Our Pavel Ivanovich showed an extraordinary flexibility in adapting to everything. He approved of the philosophical unhurriedness of his host, saying that it promised a hundred-year life. About solitude he expressed himself rather felicitously—namely, that it nursed great thoughts in a man. Having looked at the library and spoken with great praise of books in general, he observed that they save a man from idleness. In short, he let fall few words, but significant. In his actions, he acted still more appropriately. He came on time, and he left on time; he did not embarrass his host with questions during the hours of his taciturnity; with pleasure he would play chess with him, with pleasure he would be silent. While the one was sending up curly clouds of pipe smoke, the other, not a pipe smoker, nevertheless invented a corresponding activity: he would, for instance, take from his pocket a silver niello snuffbox and, placing it between two fingers of his left hand, spin it quickly with a finger of the right, just as the earthly sphere spins on its axis, or else he would simply drum on the snuffbox with his fingers, whistling some tune or other. In short, he did not hinder his host in any way. “For the first time I see a man one can get along with,” Tentetnikov said to himself. “Generally we lack this art. There are plenty of people among us who are intelligent, and educated, and kind, but people who are constantly agreeable, people of a constantly even temper, people with whom one can live for ages without quarreling—I don’t know that we can find many such people! Here is the first, the only man I’ve seen!” Such was Tentetnikov’s opinion of his guest.",
"— Ну, так я ж тебе скажу прямее, — сказал он, поправившись, — только, пожалуйста, не проговорись никому. Я задумал жениться; но нужно тебе знать, что отец и мать невесты преамбиционные люди. Такая, право, комиссия: не рад, что связался, хотят непременно, чтоб у жениха было никак не меньше трехсот душ, а так как у меня целых почти полутораста крестьян недостает…","“Well, I’ll tell you more directly,” he said, recovering himself, “only please don’t let anyone know. I thought about getting married; but you need to know that the father and mother of the bride are pre-ambitious people. Such, really, the commission: I’m not glad that I got in touch, they certainly want the groom to have no less than three hundred souls, and since I have almost a hundred and fifty peasants missing ...","“Oh, very well, then I will tell you straight out,” he said, to set himself right, “only please don’t speak of it to any one. I am going to be married, but I must tell you that the father and mother of my betrothed are very ambitious people. It’s a regular nuisance. I regret the engagement: they are set on their daughter’s husband having at least three hundred souls, and as I am quite a hundred and fifty souls short of that . . .”","“I must tell him straight out,” he said to himself as he pulled his wits together. “Should I tell you the truth,” he added aloud, “I must beg of you not to repeat it. The truth is that I am thinking of getting married. But, unfortunately, my betrothed’s father and mother are very ambitious people, and do not want me to marry her, since they desire the bridegroom to own not less than three hundred souls, whereas I own but a hundred and fifty, and that number is not sufficient.”","“Well, then I’ll tell you more directly,” he said, correcting himself, “only please don’t let on to anyone. I have a mind to get married; but you must know that the father and mother of the bride are most ambitious people. It’s such a mishap, really: I’m sorry I got into it , they absolutely insist that the bridegroom own not less than three hundred souls, and since I’m lacking almost as many as a hundred and fifty souls …”","“Very well, then, I’ll be more straightforward with you,” he said, having recovered himself, “only please don’t let it out to anybody. I’ve gotten it into my head to marry; but you must know that my bride’s father and mother are most ambitious folk. What a fix I’m in, to be sure! I’m sorry I ever became mixed up with them; they want their daughter’s bridegroom to have no less than three hundred serfs, without fail, and since I have practically all of a hundred and fifty peasants lacking—”"

"Почти в течение целых пяти минут все хранили молчание; раздавался только стук, производимый носом дрозда о дерево деревянной клетки, на дне которой удил он хлебные зернышки. Чичиков еще раз окинул комнату, и все, что в ней ни было, — все было прочно, неуклюже в высочайшей степени и имело какое-то странное сходство с самим хозяином дома; в углу гостиной стояло пузатое ореховое бюро на пренелепых четырех ногах, совершенный медведь. Стол, кресла, стулья — все было самого тяжелого и беспокойного свойства, — словом, каждый предмет, каждый стул, казалось, говорил: «И я тоже Собакевич!» или: «И я тоже очень похож на Собакевича!»","For almost five whole minutes everyone was silent; only the sound of the thrush's nose against the wood of the wooden cage was heard, at the bottom of which it was fishing grains of bread. Chichikov looked around the room once more, and everything in it was solid, clumsy to the highest degree, and had some strange resemblance to the owner of the house himself; in the corner of the living room stood a pot-bellied walnut office on absurd four legs, a perfect bear. The table, the armchairs, the chairs—everything was of the most heaviest and restless quality—in a word, every object, every chair seemed to say: “And I, too, Sobakevich!” or: “And I also look a lot like Sobakevich!”","For the space of fully five minutes they all remained silent; the only sound was the tap of the thrush’s beak on the cage as he picked up grains from the floor of it. Tchitchikov looked round at the room again and everything in it, everything was solid and clumsy to the last degree and had a strange resemblance to the master of the house. In a corner of the room stood a paunchy walnut bureau on four very absurd legs looking exactly like a bear. The table, the armchairs, the chairs were all of the heaviest and most uncomfortable shape; in short, every chair, every object seemed to be saying, “I am a Sobakevitch too!” or “I too am very like Sobakevitch!”","For fully five minutes all present preserved a complete silence—the only sound audible being that of the blackbird’s beak against the wooden floor of the cage as the creature fished for grains of corn. Meanwhile Chichikov again surveyed the room, and saw that everything in it was massive and clumsy in the highest degree; as also that everything was curiously in keeping with the master of the house. For example, in one corner of the apartment there stood a hazelwood bureau with a bulging body on four grotesque legs—the perfect image of a bear. Also, the tables and the chairs were of the same ponderous, unrestful order, and every single article in the room appeared to be saying either, “I, too, am a Sobakevitch,” or “I am exactly like Sobakevitch.”","For the space of nearly a whole five minutes, they all preserved their silence; the only sound was the tapping of the thrush’s beak against the wood of the wooden cage, on the bottom of which he was fishing for grains of wheat. Chichikov glanced around the room once more: everything that was in it, everything, was solid, clumsy in the highest degree, and bore some strange resemblance to the master of the house himself; in the corner of the drawing room stood a big-bellied walnut bureau on four most preposterous legs, a veritable bear. The table, the chairs, the armchairs—all was of the most heavy and uncomfortable quality—in short, every object, every chair seemed to be saying: “I, too, am Sobakevich!” or “I, too, am very like Sobakevich!”","For almost a full five minutes they all preserved silence, broken only by the pecking noise made by the blackbird’s beak against the wood of its wooden cage as it angled for grains of wheat at the bottom. Chichikov once more cast his glance over the room and all that was in it: everything was solid, unwieldy in the highest degree, and had some sort of strange resemblance to the master of the house himself. In a corner of the drawing room stood a potbellied walnut bureau on four utterly preposterous legs, a perfect bear of a bureau! The table, the armchairs, the chairs, all had a most ponderous and disquieting quality about them; in short, every object, every chair, seemed to be saying: “I, too, am Sobakevich!” or: “I, too, look very much like Sobakevich!”"
"Читатель, я думаю, уже заметил, что Чичиков, несмотря на ласковый вид, говорил, однако же, с большею свободою, нежели с Маниловым, и вовсе не церемонился. Надобно сказать, кто у нас на Руси если не угнались еще кой в чем другом за иностранцами, то далеко перегнали их в умении обращаться. Пересчитать нельзя всех оттенков и тонкостей нашего обращения. Француз или немец век не смекнет и не поймет всех его особенностей и различий; он почти тем же голосом и тем же языком станет говорить и с миллионщиком, и с мелким табачным торгашом, хотя, конечно, в душе поподличает в меру перед первым. У нас не то: у нас есть такие мудрецы, которые с помещиком, имеющим двести душ, будут говорить совсем иначе, нежели с тем, у которого их триста, а у которого их триста, будут говорить опять не так, как с тем, у которого их пятьсот, а с тем, у которого их пятьсот, опять не так, как с тем, у которого их восемьсот, — словом, хоть восходи до миллиона, всё найдут оттенки. Положим, например, существует канцелярия, не здесь, а в тридевятом государстве, а в канцелярии, положим, существует правитель канцелярии. Прошу смотреть на него, когда он сидит среди своих подчиненных, — да просто от страха и слова не выговоришь! гордость и благородство, и уж чего не выражает лицо его? просто бери кисть, да и рисуй: Прометей, решительный Прометей! Высматривает орлом, выступает плавно, мерно. Тот же самый орел, как только вышел из комнаты и приближается к кабинету своего начальника, куропаткой такой спешит с бумагами под мышкой, что мочи нет. В обществе и на вечеринке, будь все небольшого чина, Прометей так и останется Прометеем, а чуть немного повыше его, с Прометеем сделается такое превращение, какого и Овидий не выдумает: муха, меньше даже мухи, уничтожился в песчинку! «Да это не Иван Петрович, — говоришь, глядя на него. — Иван Петрович выше ростом, а этот и низенький и худенький; тот говорит громко, басит и никогда не смеется, а этот черт знает что: пищит птицей и все смеется». Подходишь ближе, глядишь — точно Иван Петрович! «Эхе-хе», — думаешь себе… Но, однако ж, обратимся к действующим лицам. Чичиков, как уж мы видели, решился вовсе не церемониться и потому, взявши в руки чашку с чаем и вливши туда фруктовой, повел такие речи:","The reader, I think, has already noticed that Chichikov, despite his affectionate air, nevertheless spoke with more freedom than with Manilov, and did not stand on ceremony at all. It must be said that those in Russia, if they have not kept pace with foreigners in something else, have far outstripped them in their ability to communicate. It is impossible to enumerate all the shades and subtleties of our appeal. A Frenchman or a German does not understand and will not understand all his features and differences; he will speak in almost the same voice and the same language with a millionaire and with a petty tobacco dealer, although, of course, in his soul he will scoff in moderation before the first. It’s not the same with us: we have such wise men who will speak with a landowner who has two hundred souls in a completely different way than with one who has three hundred of them, and who has three hundred of them, they will again speak differently from the one with who has five hundred of them, but with the one who has five hundred of them, again it is not the same as with the one who has eight hundred of them - in a word, even ascend to a million, everything will find shades. Suppose, for example, there is an office, not here, but in a distant state, but in the office, let's say, there is a ruler of the office. I ask you to look at him when he is sitting among his subordinates - you just can’t utter a word from fear! pride and nobility, and what does not his face express? just take a brush and draw: Prometheus, decisive Prometheus! He looks out like an eagle, acts smoothly, measuredly. The same eagle, as soon as he left the room and approaches his boss's office, hurries like a partridge with papers under his arm that there is no urine. In society and at a party, if everyone is of a low rank, Prometheus will remain Prometheus, and a little higher than him, such a transformation will take place with Prometheus, which even Ovid will not invent: a fly, even less than a fly, has annihilated into a grain of sand! “Yes, this is not Ivan Petrovich,” you say, looking at him. - Ivan Petrovich is taller, and this one is short and thin; that one speaks loudly, basses and never laughs, but this devil knows what: he squeaks like a bird and laughs all the time. You come closer, you look - it’s like Ivan Petrovich! “Ehehe,” you think to yourself ... But, nevertheless, let's turn to the characters. Chichikov, as we have already seen, decided not to stand on ceremony at all, and therefore, taking a cup of tea in his hands and pouring some fruit into it, he spoke as follows:","The reader has, I imagine, already observed that in spite of his friendly air Tchitchikov spoke with more freedom and easiness than with Manilov and did not stand on ceremony at all. It must be said that if we in Russia have not caught up with foreigners in other things, we have far outstripped them in the knowledge of how to behave. All the shades and subtleties of our manners cannot be counted. A Frenchman or a German would never catch and understand all its peculiarities and distinctions; he will speak in almost the same tone of voice and almost the same language to a millionaire and to a little tobacconist, though of course in his soul he will grovel quite sufficiently before the former. It is not so with us: there are among us persons so clever that they can talk to a landowner with two hundred souls quite differently from the way in which they speak to one with three hundred, and to the one with three hundred they will speak differently again from the manner in which they will address one with five hundred; and to one with five hundred they do not talk as they do to one with eight hundred; in short there are shades all up to a million. Let us suppose, for instance, that there is a government office—not here but in some fairy kingdom—and let us suppose that in the office there is a head of the office. I beg you to look at him when he is sitting among his subordinates—one is simply too awestricken to utter a word. Pride and dignity ... and what else is not expressed upon his face? You should take a brush and paint him: a Prometheus,af a perfect Prometheus! He looks like an eagle, he moves with a measured step. That very eagle, when he has left his own room and is approaching the sanctum of his chief, flutters along like a partridge with papers under his arm as best he may. In company and at an evening-party if all present are of a low rank, Prometheus remains Prometheus, but if they are ever so little above him, Prometheus undergoes a metamorphosis such as Ovidag never imagined: he is a fly, less than a fly indeed, he humbles himself into the dust! “But this isn’t Ivan Petrovitch,” you say, looking at him. “Ivan Petrovitch is taller, and this fellow is both short and thin; Ivan Petrovitch talks in a loud bass voice and never laughs, while there is no making this fellow out, he pipes like a bird and keeps laughing.” You go near, you look, it really is Ivan Petrovitch! “Aha!” you think to yourself. . . . However, we will return to the characters of our story. Tchitchikov, as we have seen already, had made up his mind not to stand on ceremony at all, and so, taking the cup of tea in his hand and pouring some home-made wine into it, he spoke as follows:","Then I will take that.” Probably the reader will have noticed that, for all his expressions of solicitude, Chichikov’s tone towards his hostess partook of a freer, a more unceremonious, nature than that which he had adopted towards Madam Manilov. And here I should like to assert that, howsoever much, in certain respects, we Russians may be surpassed by foreigners, at least we surpass them in adroitness of manner. In fact the various shades and subtleties of our social intercourse defy enumeration. A Frenchman or a German would be incapable of envisaging and understanding all its peculiarities and differences, for his tone in speaking to a millionaire differs but little from that which he employs towards a small tobacconist—and that in spite of the circumstance that he is accustomed to cringe before the former. With us, however, things are different. In Russian society there exist clever folk who can speak in one manner to a landowner possessed of two hundred peasant souls, and in another to a landowner possessed of three hundred, and in another to a landowner possessed of five hundred. In short, up to the number of a million souls the Russian will have ready for each landowner a suitable mode of address. For example, suppose that somewhere there exists a government office, and that in that office there exists a director. I would beg of you to contemplate him as he sits among his myrmidons. Sheer nervousness will prevent you from uttering a word in his presence, so great are the pride and superiority depicted on his countenance. Also, were you to sketch him, you would be sketching a veritable Prometheus, for his glance is as that of an eagle, and he walks with measured, stately stride. Yet no sooner will the eagle have left the room to seek the study of his superior officer than he will go scurrying along (papers held close to his nose) like any partridge. But in society, and at the evening party (should the rest of those present be of lesser rank than himself) the Prometheus will once more become Prometheus, and the man who stands a step below him will treat him in a way never dreamt of by Ovid, seeing that each fly is of lesser account than its superior fly, and becomes, in the presence of the latter, even as a grain of sand. “Surely that is not Ivan Petrovitch?” you will say of such and such a man as you regard him. “Ivan Petrovitch is tall, whereas this man is small and spare. Ivan Petrovitch has a loud, deep voice, and never smiles, whereas this man (whoever he may be) is twittering like a sparrow, and smiling all the time.” Yet approach and take a good look at the fellow and you will see that is IS Ivan Petrovitch. “Alack, alack!” will be the only remark you can make. Let us return to our characters in real life. We have seen that, on this occasion, Chichikov decided to dispense with ceremony; wherefore, taking up the teapot, he went on as follows:","The reader, I suppose, will already have noticed that Chichikov, despite his benign air, nevertheless spoke with greater liberty than with Manilov, and did not stand on any ceremony. It must be said that if we in Russia are still behind foreigners in some other things, we have far outstripped them in the art of address. Countless are all the nuances and subtleties of our address. No Frenchman or German will ever puzzle out and comprehend all its peculiarities and distinctions; he will speak in almost the same voice and language with a millionaire and with a mere tobacconist, though, of course, in his soul he will grovel duly before the first. Not so with us: there are such sages among us as will speak quite differently to a landowner with two hundred souls than to one with three hundred, and to one with three hundred, again, not as he will speak to one with five hundred, and to one with five hundred, again, not as to one with eight hundred—in short, you can go right up to a million, there will always be nuances. Suppose, for instance, that there exists an office, not here, but in some far-off kingdom, and in that office suppose there exists the head of the office. I ask you to look at him as he sits among his subordinates—one cannot even utter a word from fear!—pride and nobility, and what else does his face not express? Just take a brush and paint him: a Prometheus, decidedly a Prometheus! His gaze is like an eagle’s, his step is smooth, measured. And this same eagle, as soon as he leaves his room and approaches his own superior’s office, scurries, papers under his arm, just like a partridge, so help me. In society or at a party, if everyone is of low rank, Prometheus simply remains Prometheus, but if there is someone a bit above him, Prometheus will undergo such a metamorphosis as even Ovid could not invent: a fly, less than a fly, he self-annihilates into a grain of sand! “No, this is not Ivan Petrovich,” you say, looking at him. “Ivan Petrovich is taller, and this is a short and skinny little fellow; Ivan Petrovich talks in a loud voice, a basso, and never laughs, while this one, devil knows, he peeps like a bird and can’t stop laughing.” You step closer, you see—it really is Ivan Petrovich! “Ah-ha-ha,” you think to yourself … But, anyhow, let us return to our cast of characters. Chichikov, as we have already seen, decided to do without ceremony altogether, and therefore, taking a cup of tea in his hand and pouring some liqueur into it, he held forth thus:","The reader must have noticed by now, I think, that Chichikov, despite his amiable air, was nevertheless much more free and easy of speech with her than he had been with Manilov and did not at all stand on ceremony. It must be said that if we Russians haven’t yet caught up in a thing or two with the natives of other lands, we have on the other hand got far ahead of them in social behavior. There’s no enumerating all the shades and refinements of our behavior. The Frenchman or the German could never in a lifetime either surmise or comprehend all its peculiarities and nuances; he will use almost the same tone and the same language in speaking both with the moneybags worth millions and the man who keeps a tiny tobacco shop, even though in soul he will, of course, crawl and cringe and fawn enough before the former. But that’s not the way we do things: we have men so wise and adroit that they will speak to a landowner possessing but two hundred serf-souls in a way altogether different from that in which they will to one who possesses three hundred of them; while to him who possesses three hundred of them they will again speak not in the same way as they would with him that has five hundred souls; while with him that has five hundred souls the manner of their speech will again differ from that used with him that has eight hundred; in brief, even if you were to go up to a million, you would find different shadings for each category. Let’s suppose, for instance, that there is a certain chancellery in existence— oh, not here, but in some Never-Never Land; and in this chancellery, let’s suppose, there exists a Director of the Chancellery. I ask you to have a look at him as he sits there among his subordinates—why, out of awe you simply wouldn’t be able to let a peep out of you. Hauteur and noblesse ... and what else doesn’t his face express? Just pick up a brush and paint away: Prometheus, Prometheus to the life! His gaze is that of an eagle; he ambulates with a smooth, measured stride. But that selfsame eagle, the moment he has stepped out of his office and nears the study of his superior, flutters along like any partridge, with all his might and main, a sheaf of papers tucked under his arm. In society or at some evening-at-home, provided that all those present are not so very high in rank, Prometheus will even remain Prometheus to the very end; but let there be present someone ever so little above him, such a transformation will overtake our Prometheus as even Ovid himself could never think of: he’s a fly, even smaller than any fly; he has been transmogrified into a grain of sand; “Why, this just can’t be our Ivan Petrovich!” you say to yourself as you look at him. “Ivan Petrovich is ever so tall, while this is not only such a squat little fellow but such a thin one, too; the other one speaks loudly, booming away in his bass and with never a laugh out of him, whereas the Devil alone knows what this one is up to: he peeps like a bird and keeps on laughing with never a stop.” You walk up nearer and take a closer look—and sure enough, if it isn’t Ivan Petrovich! “Oho, ho, ho!” you think to yourself.... However, let us get back to the actors in our drama. Chichikov, as we have already seen, had decided not to stand on any ceremony whatsoever, and therefore, picking up his cup and lacing his tea with the fruit brandy, led off with: “That’s a fine hamlet you’ve got, mother."
"— Да я их отпирал, — сказал Петрушка, да и соврал. Впрочем, барин и сам знал, что он соврал, но уж не хотел ничего возражать. После сделанной поездки он чувствовал сильную усталость. Потребовавши самый легкий ужин, состоявший только в поросенке, он тот же час разделся и, забравшись под одеяло, заснул сильно, крепко, заснул чудным образом, как спят одни только те счастливцы, которые не ведают ни геморроя, ни блох, ни слишком сильных умственных способностей.","“Yes, I unlocked them,” Petrushka said, and he lied. However, the master himself knew that he was lying, but he did not want to object to anything. After the trip, he felt very tired. Having demanded the lightest supper, which consisted only of a pig, he immediately undressed and, crawling under the covers, fell deeply, soundly, fell asleep miraculously, as only those lucky ones sleep who know neither hemorrhoids, nor fleas, nor too strong mental abilities.","“I did open them,” said Petrushka, but he was lying. And his master knew he was lying, but he did not care to contest it. He felt greatly fatigued after his expedition. Ordering the very lightest of suppers, consisting of sucking-pig, he undressed immediately after it, and getting under the bedclothes, fell into a sound sleep, fell into that sweet sleep which is the privilege of those happy mortals who know nothing of piles or fleas, or of over-developed intellectual faculties.","“But I did have them opened,” replied Petrushka. Nevertheless this was a lie, as Chichikov well knew, though he was too tired to contest the point. After ordering and consuming a light supper of sucking pig, he undressed, plunged beneath the bedclothes, and sank into the profound slumber which comes only to such fortunate folk as are troubled neither with mosquitoes nor fleas nor excessive activity of brain.","“But I did open them,” Petrushka said, lying. Incidentally, the master knew he was lying, but he had no wish to object. After the trip he had made, he felt great fatigue. Having asked for a very light supper, consisting only of suckling pig, he straightaway got undressed and, slipping under the blanket, fell asleep soundly, deeply, fell asleep in the wondrous way that they alone sleep who are so fortunate as to know nothing of hemorrhoids, or fleas, or overly powerful mental abilities.","“Why, I did have them open,” said Petrushka, but he was lying. His master himself knew that he was lying, but he no longer wanted to pursue the argument any further. Having eaten the lightest of suppers, consisting only of a suckling pig, he immediately undressed and, climbing in under his blanket, fell into fast, sound slumber, fell into that marvelous slumber which is known only to those fortunate beings who are bothered neither by hemorrhoids, nor fleas, nor overdeveloped mental faculties."
— Нет?,- Not?,"“No, really?”",“Surely not?”,“No!”,“Really?”
"— Позвольте вам вместо того, чтобы заводить длинное дело, вы, верно, не хорошо рассмотрели самое завещание: там, верно, есть какая-нибудь приписочка. Вы возьмите его на время к себе. Хотя, конечно, подобных вещей на дом брать запрещено, но если хорошенько попросить некоторых чиновников… Я с своей стороны употреблю мое участие.","“Allow me, instead of starting a long business, you probably didn’t examine the will itself well: there must be some kind of postscript there. You take him for a while. Although, of course, it is forbidden to take such things home, but if you kindly ask some officials ... For my part, I will use my participation.","“Instead of making a long business of it, allow me to suggest that you have very likely not examined the will properly: probably there is some little note in it. You should take it home for the time. Although of course it is against the law to take such things into one’s own keeping, yet if you ask certain officials in the proper way ... I will use my influence too.”","How, after this—after the guest had shown such innocent affection for the little one, and magnanimously paid for his so doing with a brand-new suit—could the father remain obdurate? Nevertheless, to avoid setting a bad example to the countryside, he and Chichikov agreed to carry through the transaction PRIVATELY, lest, otherwise, a scandal should arise.","“If I may, instead of starting a long case, you probably did not examine the will very well: there’s probably some sort of little addition. Take it home for a while. Though, of course, it’s prohibited to take such things home, still, if you ask certain officials nicely … I, for my part, will exercise my concern.”",
"— Прошу прощенья! я, кажется, вас побеспокоил. Пожалуйте, садитесь сюда! Прошу! — Здесь он усадил его в кресла с некоторою даже ловкостию, как такой медведь, который уже побывал в руках, умеет и перевертываться, и делать разные штуки на вопросы: «А покажи, Миша, как бабы парятся» или: «А как, Миша, малые ребята горох крадут?»","- Sorry! I seem to have disturbed you. Please sit here! Ask! - Here he seated him in an armchair with some even dexterity, like such a bear, which has already been in the hands, can both roll over and do different things to the questions: “Show me, Misha, how women soar” or: “How, Misha , small guys steal peas?","“I beg your pardon! I’m afraid I have caused you discomfort. Please sit down here! Please!” Whereupon he sat Tchitchikov down in an easy-chair with a certain dexterity, like a bear who has been trained and knows how to turn somersaults and to perform various tricks when he is asked such questions as: “Come show us, Misha, how do peasant women have a steam bath?” or “How do little children steal peas, Misha?”","“I BEG your pardon!” said Sobakevitch hastily. “Evidently I have hurt you. Pray sit down again.” “No,” retorted Chichikov.","“I beg your pardon! I seem to have inconvenienced you. Do sit down here! Please!” Whereupon he seated him in an armchair even with a certain dexterity, like a bear that has had some training and knows how to turn somersaults and perform various tricks in response to questions like: “Show us, Misha, how peasant women take a steam bath” or “Misha, how do little children steal peas?”","“I beg your pardon! I think I’ve inconvenienced you? Sit down here, if you’ll be so kind! If you please!” Here he plumped him into an easy chair, even with a certain dexterity, like one of those bears that have been through a trainer’s hands and can both turn cartwheels and go through sundry pantomime routines in answer to such questions as, “And now show us, Misha, how do womenfolk carry on in a steam bath?” “And how, Misha, do little boys go about stealing peas in a garden?”"
"Но это, однако ж, несообразно! это несогласно ни с чем! это невозможно, чтобы чиновники так могли сами напугать себя; создать такой вздор, так отдалиться от истины, когда даже ребенку видно, в чем дело! Так скажут многие читатели и уморят автора в несообразностях или назовут бедных чиновников дураками, потому что щедр человек на слово «дурак» и готов прислужиться им двадцать раз на день своему ближнему. Довольно из десяти сторон иметь одну глупую, чтобы быть признану дураком мимо девяти хороших. Читателям легко судить, глядя из своего покойного угла и верхушки, откуда открыт весь горизонт на все, что делается внизу, где человеку виден только близкий предмет. И во всемирной летописи человечества много есть целых столетий, которые, казалось бы, вычеркнул и уничтожил как ненужные. Много совершилось в мире заблуждений, которых бы, казалось, теперь не сделал и ребенок. Какие искривленные, глухие, узкие, непроходимые, заносящие далеко в сторону дороги избирало человечество, стремясь достигнуть вечной истины, тогда как перед ним весь был открыт прямой путь, подобный пути, ведущему к великолепной храмине, назначенной царю в чертоги! Всех других путей шире и роскошнее он, озаренный солнцем и освещенный всю ночь огнями, но мимо его в глухой темноте текли люди. И сколько раз уже наведенные нисходившим с небес смыслом, они и тут умели отшатнуться и сбиться в сторону, умели среди бела дня попасть вновь в непроходимые захолустья, умели напустить вновь слепой туман друг другу в очи и, влачась вслед за болотными огнями, умели-таки добраться до пропасти, чтобы потом с ужасом спросить друг друга: где выход, где дорога? Видит теперь все ясно текущее поколение, дивится заблужденьям, смеется над неразумием своих предков, не зря, что небесным огнем исчерчена сия летопись, что кричит в ней каждая буква, что отвсюду устремлен пронзительный перст на него же, на него, на текущее поколение; но смеется текущее поколение и самонадеянно, гордо начинает ряд новых заблуждений, над которыми также потом посмеются потомки.","But this, however, is inconsistent! it doesn't agree with anything! it is impossible that the officials could scare themselves like that; create such nonsense, so far from the truth, when even a child can see what the matter is! So many readers will say and kill the author in inconsistencies or call the poor officials fools, because a person is generous with the word ""fool"" and is ready to serve them twenty times a day to his neighbor. It is enough to have one stupid party out of ten to be recognized as a fool by nine good ones. It is easy for readers to judge, looking from their quiet corner and top, from where the entire horizon is open to everything that is happening below, where only a close object is visible to a person. And in the world annals of mankind there are many whole centuries, which, it would seem, were crossed out and destroyed as unnecessary. Many errors have taken place in the world, which it would seem that even a child would not do now. What crooked, deaf, narrow, impassable, drifting roads mankind has chosen, striving to reach the eternal truth, while the whole straight path was open before it, similar to the path leading to the magnificent temple appointed by the king to the palaces! It is wider and more luxurious than all other paths, illuminated by the sun and illuminated by lights all night, but people flowed past it in the dead darkness. And how many times already induced by the meaning descending from heaven, they knew how to stagger back and stray to the side, they knew how in broad daylight to fall back into impenetrable backwoods, they knew how to throw a blind fog into each other’s eyes again and, dragging after the marsh lights, they knew how to get to the abyss, then to ask each other with horror: where is the exit, where is the road? Now the current generation sees everything clearly, marvels at the delusions, laughs at the foolishness of its ancestors, it is not in vain that this chronicle is scribbled with heavenly fire, that every letter screams in it, that a piercing finger is directed from everywhere at him, at him, at the current generation; but the current generation laughs and arrogantly, proudly begins a series of new delusions, which will also be laughed at by descendants later.","“But this is absurd though! It’s out of the question! It’s impossible that officials could scare themselves so , could make up such nonsense, could stray so far from the truth when a child could have seen through it!” Many readers will say this, and will blame the author for improbability, or will call the poor officials fools, for man is lavish in the use of the word fool, and is ready to apply it to his neighbour twenty times a day. It is quite enough if out of ten points in his character he has one stupid one, for him to be set down as a fool in spite of his nine good points. It is easy for readers to criticise, looking down from their comfortable niche on the heights from which the whole horizon lies open, at all that is taking place below, where man can only see the object nearest to him. And in the history of humanity there are many whole centuries which he would , I fancy, strike out and suppress as unnecessary. Many mistakes have been made in the world which now one would hardly think a child could make. How many crooked, narrow, impassable blind alleys, leading far off the track, has mankind chosen in the effort to reach the eternal verity, while before him the straight road lay open like the road that leads to a magnificent mansion destined to be a royal palace! It is broader and more splendid than all the other paths, with the sun lighting it up by day and many lights by night. But men have streamed past it in blind darkness. And how many times even when guided by understanding that has been given them from heaven, they have managed even then to halt and go astray, have managed in the light of day to get into the impassable jungle, have managed to throw a blinding fog again over one another’s eyes, and lured by will-of-the-wisps have succeeded in reaching the brink of the abyss, only to ask one another with horror: “Where is the way out? Where is the road?” The present generation sees everything clearly, marvels at the errors and laughs at the follies of its forefathers, not seeing that there are streaks of heavenly light in that history, that every letter in it cries aloud to them, that on all sides a pointing finger is turned upon it, upon the present generation. But the present generation laughs and proudly, self-confidently, enters upon a series of fresh errors at which their descendants will laugh again in their turn.","Finally, the majority of the audience left the room, and only the Chief of Police remained to listen (in the hope of gathering something more); but at last even he found himself forced to disclaim the speaker with a gesture which said: “The devil only knows what the fellow is talking about!” and so voiced the general opinion that it was no use trying to gather figs of thistles. Meanwhile Chichikov knew nothing of these events; for, having contracted a slight chill, coupled with a sore throat, he had decided to keep his room for three days; during which time he gargled his throat with milk and fig juice, consumed the fruit from which the juice had been extracted, and wore around his neck a poultice of camomile and camphor.","But this, however, is incongruous! this is incompatible with anything! this is impossible—that officials should scare themselves so; to create such nonsense, to stray so far from the truth, when even a child could see what the matter was! So many readers will say, reproaching the author for incongruousness or calling the poor officials fools, because man is generous with the word “fool” and is ready to serve it up to his neighbor twenty times a day. It is enough to have one stupid side out of ten to be accounted a fool, aside from the nine good ones. It is easy for the reader to judge, looking down from his comfortable corner at the top, from which the whole horizon opens out, upon all that is going on below, where man can see only the nearest object. And in the world chronicle of mankind there are many whole centuries which, it would seem, should be crossed out and abolished as unnecessary. There have been many errors in the world which, it would seem, even a child would not make now. What crooked, blind, narrow, impassable, far-straying paths mankind has chosen, striving to attain eternal truth, while a whole straight road lay open before it, like the road leading to a magnificent dwelling meant for a king’s mansions! Broader and more splendid than all other roads it is, lit by the sun and illumined all night by lamps, yet people have flowed past it in the blind darkness. So many times already, though guided by a sense come down from heaven, they have managed to waver and go astray, have managed in broad daylight to get again into an impassable wilderness, have managed again to blow a blinding fog into each other’s eyes, and, dragging themselves after marsh-lights, have managed finally to reach the abyss, only to ask one another in horror: where is the way out, where is the path? The current generation now sees everything clearly, it marvels at the errors, it laughs at the folly of its ancestors, not seeing that this chronicle is all overscored by divine fire, that every letter of it cries out, that from everywhere the piercing finger is pointed at it, at this current generation; but the current generation laughs and presumptuously, proudly begins a series of new errors, at which their descendants will also laugh afterwards.","“But come, now, all this is absurd! This is utterly preposterous! It’s impossible that these officials should frighten themselves so , should create such a bother over a rigmarole like that, should go so far astray from the truth when even the veriest babe can see what the whole business is about!” That’s what many readers will say, and they’ll accuse the author of writing absurdities or will call the poor officials fools, since man is openhanded with the word fool and is ready to deal it out twenty times a day to his fellowman. It suffices to have but one foolish point in one’s makeup to be recognized as a fool, despite the other nine good points. It’s easy enough for the readers to sit in judgment within their tranquil and lofty retreats, whence they have the whole horizon unobscured before them and can see all that is going on there, below, where only the object that is near at hand is visible to man. Even in the universal chronicle of mankind there are many whole centuries which one would, it seems, like to delete and do away with as unnecessary. Many delusions have overtaken this world, which delusions even a child, apparently, would not be subject to now. What twisted, godforsaken, narrow, impassable bypaths that have diverted it far from the goal has not mankind chosen in its strivings to attain the eternal truth, when spreading right before it was an open way, like a path that leads to a great temple meant for a kings mansions! Than all other ways is it broader and more splendid, lit up by the sun and illumined all night by lights, yet it is past it, in a profound darkness, that men have streamed. And how oft, already guided by reason that had come down from heaven, have they not contrived, even then, to backslide and to stray off, how oft have they not contrived, even in broad daylight, to come upon impassable wildernesses, how oft have they not contrived to becloud one another’s eyes anew with impenetrable fog and, pursuing will-o’-the-wisps , have contrived in the very end to make their way to the very brink of an abyss, only to ask one another in horror: Where is the way out? Where is the path? The present generation sees everything clearly now; it wonders at the delusions and laughs at the lack of comprehension of its ancestors, not perceiving that this chronicle is written over with heavenly fire, that every letter therein is calling out to it, that from every direction a piercing forefinger is pointed at it, at it and none other than it, the present generation. But the present generation laughs and, self-reliantry, proudly, launches a new succession of delusions, over which its descendants will laugh in their turn, even as the present generation is laughing now."

"Деревянный потемневший трактир принял Чичикова под свой узенький гостеприимный навес на деревянных выточенных столбиках, похожих на старинные церковные подсвечники. Трактир был что-то вроде русской избы, несколько в большем размере. Резные узорочные карнизы из свежего дерева вокруг окон и под крышей резко и живо пестрели темные его стены; на ставнях были нарисованы кувшины с цветами.","The darkened wooden tavern received Chichikov under its narrow hospitable canopy on carved wooden posts, resembling old church candlesticks. The tavern was something like a Russian hut, somewhat larger. Carved ornamental cornices of fresh wood around the windows and under the roof brightly and vividly dazzled its dark walls; jugs of flowers were painted on the shutters.","The wooden tavern, blackened by age, received Tchitchikov under its narrow hospitable porch which stood on carved wooden posts like old-fashioned church candlesticks. The tavern was something in the style of a Russian peasant’s hut but on a rather larger scale. The cornices of new wood carved in patterns round the windows and under the roof stood out vividly against the dark walls; pots of flowers were painted on the shutters.","The little wooden tavern, with its narrow, but hospitable, curtain suspended from a pair of rough-hewn doorposts like old church candlesticks, seemed to invite Chichikov to enter. True, the establishment was only a Russian hut of the ordinary type, but it was a hut of larger dimensions than usual, and had around its windows and gables carved and patterned cornices of bright-coloured wood which threw into relief the darker hue of the walls, and consorted well with the flowered pitchers painted on the shutters.","The weathered wooden tavern received Chichikov under its narrow, hospitable porch roof on turned wooden posts, resembling old church candlestands. The tavern was rather like a Russian peasant cottage, on a somewhat bigger scale. Carved lacy cornices of fresh wood around the windows and under the eaves stood out in sharp and vivid patches against its dark walls; pots of flowers were painted on the shutters.","The wooden, time-stained inn received Chichikov under its shed, narrow and small but hospitable, supported by short turned columns of wood that looked like antiquated church candlesticks. The inn was something in the nature of a Russian hut, only on a larger scale.

"Здесь учитель обратил все внимание на Фемистоклюса и казалось, хотел ему вскочить в глаза, но наконец совершенно успокоился и кивнул головою, когда Фемистоклюс сказал: «Париж».","Here the teacher turned all his attention to Themistoclus and seemed to want to jump into his eyes, but at last he completely calmed down and nodded his head when Themistoclus said: ""Paris.""","At this point the tutor concentrated his whole attention on Themistoclus and looked as though he were going to spring into his face, but was completely reassured at last and nodded his head when Themistoclus said: “Paris.”","Upon this the tutor concentrated his attention upon Themistocleus, and appeared to be trying hard to catch his eye.

Chichikov thought to himself, ""and a beast to boot!""","“The fist, the fist!” Tchitchikov thought to himself, “and he’s a brute into the bargain.”","However, in a friendly transaction one must not be too particular.” “What a kulak!” thought Chichikov to himself. “And what a brute beast!”","“A pinchfist, a real pinchfist!” Chichikov thought to himself, “and a knave to boot!”","“Kulak, kulak!” Chichikov thought to himself. “And a low-down beast, to boot.”"
"Появление его на бале произвело необыкновенное действие. Все, что ни было, обратилось к нему навстречу, кто с картами в руках, кто на самом интересном пункте разговора произнесши: «а нижний земский суд отвечает на это…», но что такое отвечает земский суд, уж это он бросил в сторону и спешил с приветствием к нашему герою. «Павел Иванович! Ах боже мой, Павел Иванович! Любезный Павел Иванович! Почтеннейший Павел Иванович! Душа моя Павел Иванович! Вот вы где, Павел Иванович! Вот он, наш Павел Иванович! Позвольте прижать вас, Павел Иванович! Давайте-ка его сюда, вот я его поцелую покрепче, моего дорогого Павла Ивановича!» Чичиков разом почувствовал себя в нескольких объятиях. Не успел совершенно выкарабкаться из объятий председателя, как очутился уже в объятиях полицеймейстера; полицеймейстер сдал его инспектору врачебной управы; инспектор врачебной управы — откупщику, откупщик — архитектору… Губернатор, который в то время стоял возле дам и держал в одной руке конфектный билет, а в другой болонку, увидя его, бросил на пол и билет и болонку, — только завизжала собачонка; словом, распространил он радость и веселье необыкновенное. Не было лица, на котором бы не выразилось удовольствие или, по крайней мере, отражение всеобщего удовольствия. Так бывает на лицах чиновников во время осмотра приехавшим начальником вверенных управлению их мест: после того как уже первый страх прошел, они увидели, что многое ему нравится, и он сам изволил наконец пошутить, то есть произнести с приятною усмешкой несколько слов. Смеются вдвое в ответ на это обступившие его приближенные чиновники; смеются от души те, которые, впрочем, несколько плохо услыхали произнесенные им слова, и, наконец, стоящий далеко у дверей у самого выхода какой-нибудь полицейский, отроду не смеявшийся во всю жизнь свою и только что показавший перед тем народу кулак, и тот по неизменным законам отражения выражает на лице своем какую-то улыбку, хотя эта улыбка более похожа на то, как бы кто-нибудь собирался чихнуть после крепкого табаку. Герой наш отвечал всем и каждому и чувствовал какую-то ловкость необыкновенную: раскланивался направо и налево, по обыкновению своему несколько набок, но совершенно свободно, так что очаровал всех. Дамы тут же обступили его блистающею гирляндою и нанесли с собою целые облака всякого рода благоуханий: одна дышала розами, от другой несло весной и фиалками, третья вся насквозь была продушена резедой; Чичиков подымал только нос кверху да нюхал. В нарядах их вкусу было пропасть: муслины, атласы, кисеи были таких бледных модных цветов, каким даже и названья нельзя было прибрать (до такой степени дошла тонкость вкуса). Ленточные банты и цветочные букеты порхали там и там по платьям в самом картинном беспорядке, хотя над этим беспорядком трудилась много порядочная голова. Легкий головной убор держался только на одних ушах, и казалось, говорил: «Эй, улечу, жаль только, что не подыму с собой красавицу!» Талии были обтянуты и имели самые крепкие и приятные для глаз формы (нужно заметить, что вообще все дамы города N. были несколько полны, но шнуровались так искусно и имели такое приятное обращение, что толщины никак нельзя было приметить). Все было у них придумано и предусмотрено с необыкновенною осмотрительностию; шея, плечи были открыты именно настолько, насколько нужно, и никак не дальше; каждая обнажила свои владения до тех пор, пока чувствовала по собственному убеждению, что они способны погубить человека; остальное все было припрятано с необыкновенным вкусом: или какой-нибудь легонький галстучек из ленты, или шарф легче пирожного, известного под именем «поцелуя», эфирно обнимал шею, или выпущены были из-за плеч, из-под платья, маленькие зубчатые стенки из тонкого батиста, известные под именем «скромностей». Эти «скромности» скрывали напереди и сзади то, что уже не могло нанести гибели человеку, а между тем заставляли подозревать, что там-то именно и была самая погибель. Длинные перчатки были надеты не вплоть до рукавов, но обдуманно оставляли обнаженными возбудительные части рук повыше локтя, которые у многих дышали завидною полнотою; у иных даже лопнули лайковые перчатки, побужденные надвинуться далее, — словом, кажется, как будто на всем было написано: нет, это не губерния, это столица, это сам Париж! Только местами вдруг высовывался какой-нибудь не виданный землею чепец или даже какое-то чуть не павлиное перо в противность всем модам, по собственному вкусу. Но уж без этого нельзя, таково свойство губернского города: где-нибудь уж он непременно оборвется. Чичиков, стоя перед ними, думал: «Которая, однако же, сочинительница письма?» — и высунул было вперед нос; но по самому носу дернул его целый ряд локтей, обшлагов, рукавов, концов лент, душистых шемизеток и платьев. Галопад летел во всю пропалую: почтмейстерша, капитан-исправник, дама с голубым пером, дама с белым пером, грузинский князь Чипхайхилидзев, чиновник из Петербурга, чиновник из Москвы, француз Куку, Перхуновский, Беребендовский — все поднялось и понеслось.","His appearance at the ball produced an extraordinary effect. Everything that happened turned to meet him, some with cards in their hands, some at the most interesting point of the conversation saying: “and the lower Zemstvo court answers this ...”, but what the Zemsky court answers is, he already threw it aside and hastened to greet our hero. ""Pavel Ivanovich! Oh my God, Pavel Ivanovich! Dear Pavel Ivanovich! Dear Pavel Ivanovich! My soul Pavel Ivanovich! There you are, Pavel Ivanovich! Here he is, our Pavel Ivanovich! Allow me to press you, Pavel Ivanovich! Let's him here, so I'll kiss him harder, my dear Pavel Ivanovich! Chichikov at once felt himself in several embraces. Before he had time to get completely out of the arms of the chairman, he found himself already in the arms of the police chief; the police chief handed him over to the inspector of the medical board; the inspector of the medical council - to the tax-farmer, the tax-farmer - to the architect ... The governor, who at that time stood near the ladies and held a candy ticket in one hand, and a lapdog in the other, on seeing him, threw both the ticket and the lapdog on the floor, - only the little dog squealed; in a word, he spread joy and extraordinary joy. There was no face that did not express pleasure, or at least a reflection of general pleasure. This is what happens on the faces of officials during an inspection by the arrived chief of their places entrusted to the department: after the first fear had already passed, they saw that he liked a lot, and he himself finally deigned to joke, that is, to say a few words with a pleasant smile. Laugh twice in response to this surrounded by his close officials; laugh heartily those who, however, somewhat badly heard the words he uttered, and, finally, standing far away at the door at the very exit, some policeman, who had never laughed in his whole life and had just shown his fist to the people, and he according to the invariable laws of reflection, he expresses a kind of smile on his face, although this smile is more like someone about to sneeze after strong tobacco. Our hero answered each and every one and felt some kind of extraordinary dexterity: he bowed to the right and left, somewhat to one side, as usual, but completely freely, so that he charmed everyone. The ladies immediately surrounded him with a shining garland and brought with them whole clouds of all sorts of fragrances: one breathed roses, another smelled of spring and violets, the third was completely perfumed with mignonette; Chichikov only turned his nose up and sniffed. Their taste was an abyss in their attire: muslins, satins, muslins were of such pale fashionable colors that even the names could not be cleaned up (the subtlety of taste reached such a degree). Ribbon bows and flower bouquets fluttered here and there over the dresses in the most picturesque mess, although a lot of decent head was working on this mess. The light headdress rested only on one ear, and seemed to say: “Hey, I’ll fly away, it’s only a pity that I won’t take the beauty with me!” The waists were tight-fitting and had the strongest and most pleasing shapes to the eye (it should be noted that in general all the ladies of the city of N. were somewhat full, but they laced up so skillfully and had such pleasant circulation that the thickness could not be noticed). Everything was invented and provided for with extraordinary circumspection; neck, shoulders were open just as much as necessary, and no further; each bared her possessions until she felt, by her own conviction, that they were capable of destroying a person; everything else was tucked away with extraordinary taste: either some light tie made of ribbon, or a scarf lighter than a cake, known as a “kiss”, ethereally hugged the neck, or were released from behind the shoulders, from under the dress, small jagged walls of thin cambric, known as ""modesty"". These “modesty” hid in front and behind that which could no longer cause death to a person, but meanwhile they made one suspect that it was there that the very death was. Long gloves were worn not up to the sleeves, but deliberately left naked the exciting parts of the arms above the elbow, which in many breathed an enviable fullness; some even had their kid gloves burst, prompted to move on—in a word, it seemed as if it was written on everything: no, this is not a province, this is the capital, this is Paris itself! Only in places would suddenly protrude some kind of cap that the earth had not seen, or even some kind of almost peacock feather, contrary to all fashions, according to one's own taste. But without this it is impossible, such is the property of a provincial city: somewhere it will certainly break off. Chichikov, standing in front of them, thought: ""Which, however, is the writer of the letter?"" - and stuck his nose forward; but on the very nose he was pulled by a whole series of elbows, cuffs, sleeves, ends of ribbons, fragrant chemisettes and dresses. The galloping was flying at full speed: the postmaster, the police captain, the lady with the blue feather, the lady with the white feather, the Georgian prince Chipkhaikhilidzev, an official from St. Petersburg, an official from Moscow, the Frenchman Kuku, Perkhunovsky, Berebendovsky - everything rose and away.","His arrival at the ball made an extraordinary impression. Every one turned to greet him, one with cards in his hand, another at the most interesting point in the conversation as he uttered the words: “And the lower district court maintains in answer to that . . .” but what the district court did maintain he abandoned altogether and hastened to welcome our hero. “Pavel Ivanovitch! Ah, goodness me, Pavel Ivanovitch! Dear Pavel Ivanovitch! Honoured Pavel Ivanovitch! My dear soul, Pavel Ivanovitch! Ah, here you are, Pavel Ivanovitch! Here he is, our Pavel Ivanovitch! Allow me to embrace you, Pavel Ivanovitch! Hand him over, let me give him a good kiss, my precious Pavel Ivanovitch!” Tchitchikov instantly felt himself clasped in the embrace of several friends. He had hardly succeeded in completely extricating himself from the embrace of the president, when he found himself in the arms of the police-master; the police-master passed him on to the inspector of the medical board; the inspector of the medical board handed him over to the government contractor, and the latter passed him on to the architect.... The governor, who was at the moment standing by some ladies, with a motto from a bon-boncp in one hand and a lap-dog in the other, dropped both motto and lap-dog on the floor on seeing him—the dog raised a shrill yelp—in short, Tchitchikov was the centre of extraordinary joy and delight. There was not a face that did not express pleasure or at least a reflection of the general pleasure. So it is with the faces of government clerks when the offices in their charge are being inspected by a newly arrived chief: when their first panic has passed off, and they see that he is pleased with a great deal and when he has graciously condescended to jest, that is to pronounce a few words with an agreeable simper, and the clerks standing near him laugh twice as much in response, those who have scarcely caught his words laugh with all their hearts too, and last of all a policeman, standing far away at the door at the very entrance, who has never laughed in his life, and has just before been shaking his fist at the people, is moved by the unalterable laws of reflection to show upon his face a smile, though it looks more as though he were sneezing after a strong pinch of snuff. Our hero responded to all and each, and was aware of a peculiar ease: he bowed to right and to left, a little to one side as he always did, but with perfect grace, so that he charmed every one. The ladies surrounded him with a galaxy of beauty, and wafted with them perfect clouds of sweet scents, one smelt of roses, another was breathing of spring and violets, another was saturated through and through with mignonette.cq Tchitchikov could only throw up his nose and sniff. A vast deal of taste was displayed in their attire; muslins, satins, chiffons were of those pale, fashionable shades, for which it is impossible to find a name, so refined is modern taste! Bows of ribbon and bunches of flowers were dotted here and there about their dresses in most picturesque disorder, though this disorder had cost an orderly brain a great deal of trouble. The light ornaments that adorned their heads held on only by the ears, and seemed to be saying: “Aie! I am taking flight, and the only pity is that I can’t carry the beauty away with me!” The waists were tightly laced and had the most firm and agreeable contour (it must be noted that generally speaking the ladies of the town of N. were rather plump, but they laced so skillfully and held themselves so gracefully, that their stoutness was not noticeable). Everything had been thought out and looked after with special care: necks and shoulders were bared just as far as was right and not a bit further; each one displayed her possessions so far as she felt from her inner conviction that they were calculated to slay her man. The rest was all covered up with extraordinary taste; either some light ribbon neck-band, dainty as the sweets known as “kisses,” ethereally encircled the neck, or little scalloped edgings of fine batiste known as “modesties,” emerged under the dress behind the shoulders. These “modesties” concealed in front and at the back what was not calculated to play havoc with the heart of man, and at the same time they aroused the suspicion that the very centre of danger was there. The long gloves were drawn up not quite to meet the sleeves, but the most alluring part of the arm above the elbow, in many cases of an enviable plumpness, was intentionally left bare; some ladies had even split their kid gloves in the effort to push them up higher—in short everything seemed to be imprinted with the words: “No, this is not a provincial town, this is Petersburg, this is Paris!” Only here and there a cap of a species never seen on earth before, or some feather, perhaps from a peacock, stood up in accordance with individual taste and in defiance of the dictates of fashion. But there is no escaping that; such originality is characteristic of a provincial town, it is bound to break out somewhere. Tchitchikov stood before them, wondering who could be the authoress of the letter, and he was about to crane his head forward for a better look round when a whole procession of elbows, cuffs, sleeves, ends of ribbons, perfumed chemisettescr and dresses flashed by under his very nose. The gallop was at its height: the postmaster’s wife, the police-captain, a lady with a pale blue feather, a lady with a white feather, the Georgian prince, Tchiphaihilidzev, an official from EPetersburg,cs an official from Moscow, a French gentleman called Coucou, Per hunovsky, Berebendovsky, all pranced up and down and flew by ...","Later, his entry into the ballroom produced an extraordinary effect. Every one present came forward to meet him, some with cards in their hands, and one man even breaking off a conversation at the most interesting point—namely, the point that “the Inferior Land Court must be made responsible for everything.” Yes, in spite of the responsibility of the Inferior Land Court, the speaker cast all thoughts of it to the winds as he hurried to greet our hero. From every side resounded acclamations of welcome, and Chichikov felt himself engulfed in a sea of embraces. Thus, scarcely had he extricated himself from the arms of the President of the Local Council when he found himself just as firmly clasped in the arms of the Chief of Police, who, in turn, surrendered him to the Inspector of the Medical Department, who, in turn, handed him over to the Commissioner of Taxes, who, again, committed him to the charge of the Town Architect. Even the Governor, who hitherto had been standing among his womenfolk with a box of sweets in one hand and a lap-dog in the other, now threw down both sweets and lap-dog (the lap-dog giving vent to a yelp as he did so) and added his greeting to those of the rest of the company. Indeed, not a face was there to be seen on which ecstatic delight—or, at all events, the reflection of other people’s ecstatic delight—was not painted. The same expression may be discerned on the faces of subordinate officials when, the newly arrived Director having made his inspection, the said officials are beginning to get over their first sense of awe on perceiving that he has found much to commend, and that he can even go so far as to jest and utter a few words of smiling approval. Thereupon every tchinovnik responds with a smile of double strength, and those who (it may be) have not heard a single word of the Director’s speech smile out of sympathy with the rest, and even the gendarme who is posted at the distant door—a man, perhaps, who has never before compassed a smile, but is more accustomed to dealing out blows to the populace—summons up a kind of grin, even though the grin resembles the grimace of a man who is about to sneeze after inadvertently taking an over-large pinch of snuff. To all and sundry Chichikov responded with a bow, and felt extraordinarily at his ease as he did so. To right and left did he incline his head in the sidelong, yet unconstrained, manner that was his wont and never failed to charm the beholder. As for the ladies, they clustered around him in a shining bevy that was redolent of every species of perfume—of roses, of spring violets, and of mignonette; so much so that instinctively Chichikov raised his nose to snuff the air. Likewise the ladies’ dresses displayed an endless profusion of taste and variety; and though the majority of their wearers evinced a tendency to embonpoint, those wearers knew how to call upon art for the concealment of the fact. Confronting them, Chichikov thought to himself: “Which of these beauties is the writer of the letter?”","His appearance at the ball produced an extraordinary effect. All that were there turned to meet him, one with cards in his hand, another saying, at the most interesting point in the conversation: “… and the lower circuit court’s answer to that was …,” but whatever the circuit court’s answer was, it was brushed aside as the man hastened to greet our hero. “Pavel Ivanovich! Ah, my God, Pavel Ivanovich! My gentle Pavel Ivanovich! My most esteemed Pavel Ivanovich! Pavel Ivanovich, my dear soul! So here’s where you are, Pavel Ivanovich! Here he is, our Pavel Ivanovich! Allow me to hug you, Pavel Ivanovich! Let him come here till I give him a good kiss, my dearest Pavel Ivanovich!” Chichikov felt himself simultaneously in several embraces. Before he had quite managed to scramble out of the magistrate’s embrace, he found himself in the police chief’s embrace; the police chief handed him on to the inspector of the board of health; the inspector of the board of health to the tax farmer, the tax farmer to the architect … The governor, who at that moment was standing by the ladies holding a candy-kiss motto in one hand and a lapdog in the other, dropped both dog and motto to the floor on seeing him—only the pup let out a squeal; in short, he spread joy and extraordinary merriment. There was not a face that did not express pleasure, or at least a reflection of the general pleasure. The same thing takes place on the faces of officials when a superior arrives to inspect the work entrusted to their management: once the initial fear has passed, they see that there is much that pleases him, and he himself finally deigns to make a joke—that is, to utter a few words with an agreeable smile. Twice as hard do the closely surrounding officials laugh in response to that; with all their hearts others laugh who, incidentally, had not heard very well what the man said, and finally some policeman standing way off by the door, by the very exit, who from the day he was born has never laughed in his whole life, and who a moment before was shaking his fist at the people, even he, by the immutable laws of reflection, puts some sort of smile on his face, though this smile is more like the look of someone about to sneeze after a pinch of strong snuff. Our hero responded to each and all, and felt himself somehow extraordinarily adroit: bowed right and left, somewhat to one side as usual, but with perfect ease, so that he enchanted everyone. The ladies surrounded him at once in a sparkling garland and brought with them whole clouds of varied fragrances; one breathed roses, another gave off a whiff of spring and violets, a third was perfumed throughout with mignonette; Chichikov just kept lifting his nose and sniffing. Their attire evinced no end of taste: the muslins, satins, cambrics were of such pale fashionable shades as could not even be matched with any names (taste had reached such a degree of fineness). Ribbon bows and bouquets of flowers fluttered here and there over the dresses in a most picturesque disorder, though this disorder had been much labored over by some orderly head. Light headdresses held on only at the ears and seemed to be saying: “Hey, I’m flying away, only it’s a pity I can’t take this beauty with me!” Waists were tight-fitting and formed in a way most firm and pleasing to the eye (it should be noted that generally the ladies of the town of N. were all a bit plump, but they laced themselves up so artfully and were of such pleasing comportment that the fatness simply could not be noticed). Everything about them had been designed and foreseen with extraordinary circumspection; neck and shoulders were revealed precisely as far as necessary, and no further; each one bared her possessions to the point to which she felt convinced in herself that they could be the ruin of a man; the rest was all secreted away with extraordinary taste: either some light little ribbon tie, or a scarf lighter than the pastry known by the name of “kiss,”39 ethereally embraced her neck, or else there peeked out around her shoulders, from under the dress, those little serrated trimmings of light cambric known by the name of “modesties.” These “modesties,” in front or behind, concealed that which could no longer be the ruin of a man, and yet made one suspect that ruin itself lay precisely there. Long gloves were worn not up to the sleeves, but deliberately leaving bare the arousing parts of the arms above the elbow, which in many ladies breathed an enviable plumpness: some kid gloves even burst in their striving to move further up—in short, everything seemed to have written on it: No, this is no province , this is a capital, this is Paris itself! Only in places would some bonnet stick out such as had never been seen on earth, or even almost some sort of peacock feather, contrary to all fashion, following its own taste. But there’s no avoiding it, such is the property of a provincial town: it is simply bound to trip up somewhere. Chichikov was thinking, as he stood before them: “Which of them, however, was the writer of that letter?” and he tried to stick his nose out; but right against his nose brushed a whole row of elbows, cuffs, sleeves, ends of ribbons, fragrant chemisettes, and dresses. Everything was galloping headlong: the postmaster’s wife, the captain of police, a lady with a blue feather, a lady with a white feather, the Georgian prince Chipkhaikhilidzev, an official from Petersburg, an official from Moscow, the Frenchman Coucou, Perkhunovsky, Berebendovsky—everything rose up and rushed on …","His arrival at the ball created an extraordinary sensation. Everyone there, without an exception, turned to greet him, even if he were holding cards or was at the most interesting point of the conversation, just after saying: “... while the lower district court maintains, in rejoinder to this ...” But just what the lower district court maintained was at once brushed aside by the speaker as he hastened to greet our hero. “Pavel Ivanovich!” “Ah, my God, it’s Pavel Ivanovich!” “Dear Pavel Ivanovich!” “My most esteemed Pavel Ivanovich!” “Pavel Ivanovich, my soul!” “So here you are, Pavel Ivanovich!” “Yes, here he is, our Pavel Ivanovich!” “Let me clasp you to my bosom, Pavel Ivanovich!” “Let’s have him here; there, I’m going to give my dear Pavel Ivanovich a real hard kiss!” Chichikov felt himself in several embraces at the same time. He had not succeeded in freeing himself entirely from the embraces of the Chairman of the Administrative Offices when he found himself in those of the Chief of Police; the Chief of Police passed him on to the Inspector of the Board of Health; the Inspector of the Board of Health to the tax-farmer; the tax-farmer to the Town Architect. . . . The Governor, who at the time of Chichikov’s entrance had been standing near the ladies, holding a printed candy wrapper in one hand and a small, fluffy white lapdog in the other, upon catching sight of Chichikov threw both the wrapper and the lapdog to the floor, so that the poor creature whimpered. In a word, Chichikov spread extraordinary rejoicing and gaiety on all sides of him. There wasn’t a face that did not express pleasure or, at least, a reflection of the general pleasure. Thus do the faces of all the bureaucrats light up when some high official arrives for an inspection of the departments entrusted to them, after their first fright has subsided and they perceive that not a few things are to the liking of the great man; he himself has at last condescended to jest a little—that is, to drop a few words with a pleasant smile—whereupon those bureaucrats who are around him laugh in response to his sally twice as hard as need be; those who, truth to tell, had heard but poorly the words he has let drop, make up for that by laughing with all their heart; and, finally, some policeman or other, stationed far-off near the door, at the very exit, who has never laughed in all his born days and who just before had shaken his fist at the people outside— why, even he, in accordance with the immutable laws of reflection, expresses on his face some sort of smile, although this smile resembles rather the grimace of someone getting set to sneeze after a pinch of strong snuff. Our hero responded to all and sundry and felt somehow extraordinarily adroit; he bowed right and left, bending somewhat to one side, as was his wont, but perfectly at his ease, so that he bewitched everybody. The ladies encircled him on the spot, forming a glittering garland about him and wafting whole clouds of fragrant odors; one breathed of roses, another spread an aura of spring and violets, a third was permeated through and through with mignonette—Chichikov could but lift up his nose and breathe in the fragrances. There was no end of tastefulness about their attire: the muslins, satins, and tulles were of such fashionable pastel shades that one could not even give their names, to such a degree had the refinement of taste attained! Bows of ribbon and flower corsages fluttered here and there over their gowns, in a most picturesque disorder, although a clever head and clever hands must have expended considerable thought and toil upon that disorder. Or one would come upon a gossamer headdress that perched only on the shell-pink ears and seemed to be saying: “Watch out—I’m going to fly away! The only pity is that I won’t lift with me the beauty wearing me!” Their waists were tightly laced and their forms most sturdily shapely and pleasing to the eye (it must be noted that the ladies of the town of N-ran, on the whole, to plumpness, but they laced themselves in so artfully and had such pleasant ways about them that the plumpness was not in any way noticeable). They had premeditated and foreseen everything with unusual thoroughness; the neck, the shoulders were exposed precisely as much as need be and by no means one jot further; each one had revealed her possessions only to that degree which her inner convictions made her feel would just about suffice to seal a man’s doom, while the rest was tucked away with unusual taste : either there was some sort of ethereal neckpiece, of some material as insubstantial as the pastries known under the name of kisses; or else small, crenelated ramparts of the finest cambric, known under the name of modesties, emerged from the dress. These modesties concealed, fore and aft, that which no longer could seal a man’s doom, and yet at the same time compelled him to suspect that this was precisely where the doom lurked. Their long gloves were put on not all the way up but with malice aforethought left exposed the seductive parts of their arms above the elbows; many of these arms were of an enviable plumpness; in some instances the kid gloves had actually burst from having been pulled up a little too far. In short, everything seemed to bear the inscription: “No, this is no province; this is a metropolis; this is Paris itself!” Only here and there some such mobcap as the earth has never yet seen would suddenly emerge, or even some weird feather, almost a peacock’s, running counter to all modes, in keeping with the wearer’s own taste. However, such things are inevitable; such is the nature of a provincial capital: somewhere it is bound to show its true nature. “However, which one of them wrote that letter?” Chichikov wondered as he stood before them and had even craned forward for a better look when a whole procession of elbows, cuffs, sleeves, ends of ribbons, perfumed chemisettes, and dresses scraped his very nose. The gallopade was going full blast; the Postmaster’s good lady, the Captain of the Rural Police, a lady with a blue feather, a lady with a white feather, a Georgian prince by the name of Chipkhaikhilidzev, a bureaucrat from St. Petersburg, a bureaucrat from Moscow, a French gentleman called Coucou, Perkhunovskii, Berebendovskii—they were up and away, all swirling and whirling."
"— Ради самого Христа! помилуй, Андрей Иванович, что это ты делаешь! Оставлять так выгодно начатый карьер из-за того только, что попался начальник не того… Что ж это?

He did not go out to amuse himself, he did not walk, he did not even care to go upstairs to look at the distance and the views, he did not care to open the windows to let the fresh air into the room; and the lovely view which no visitor could gaze upon without delight seemed not to exist for the owner. From this record of his day, the reader can gather that Andrey Ivanovitch Tyentyetnikov belonged to that class of people, numerous in Russia, who are known as idlers, sluggards, lazy-bones, and so on.","Clad constantly in slippers and a dressing-gown, Tientietnikov never went out, never indulged in any form of dissipation, and never walked upstairs. Nothing did he care for fresh air, and would bestow not a passing glance upon all those beauties of the countryside which moved visitors to such ecstatic admiration. From this the reader will see that Andrei Ivanovitch Tientietnikov belonged to that band of sluggards whom we always have with us, and who, whatever be their present appellation, used to be known by the nicknames of “lollopers,” “bed pressers,” and “marmots.”","And thus, as alone as could be in the whole world, this young man of thirty-three spent his time, sitting around in a dressing gown without a tie. He did not feel like strolling, like walking, did not even want to go upstairs and have a look at the distances and views, did not even want to open the windows and let some fresh air into his room, and the beautiful view of the countryside, which no visitor could admire with indifference, was as if it did not exist for the owner himself.",

"Последние слова понравились Манилову, но в толк самого дела он все-таки никак не вник и вместо ответа принялся насасывать свой чубук так сильно, что тот начал наконец хрипеть, как фагот. Казалось, как будто он хотел вытянуть из него мнение относительно такого неслыханного обстоятельства; но чубук хрипел и больше ничего.","Manilov liked the last words, but he still did not understand the meaning of the matter itself, and instead of answering, he began to suck his chibouk so hard that he finally began to wheeze like a bassoon.

"— Я также, — сказал Чичиков. И оба отказались они решительно.","""Me too,"" said Chichikov.

— Нектар! — сказал Чичиков. Выпил стакан от другого графина — еще лучше.,- Nectar! Chichikov said. Drank a glass from another decanter - even better.,"It was like the effervescent beverage he had sometimes drunk in Poland, fizzing like champagne, and the gas mounted with an agreeable stinging sen sation from the mouth into the nose. “Nectar,” said Tchitchikov. He drank a glass from another decanter, it was better still.",“Nectar!” he proclaimed. Then he took some from a second decanter. It proved to be even better than the first. “A beverage of beverages!” he exclaimed.,“Nectar!” said Chichikov. He drank a glass from another carafe—even better.,

Manilov asked the clerk as he left.,“And for what reason do you want to know?” Manilov inquired when the steward had gone.,“For what purpose do you want it?” inquired Manilov when the bailiff had gone.,“And for what reasons do you need this?” Manilov asked after the steward had gone.,“And for what reasons do you need this?” asked Manilov when the steward had taken his leave.

""Here is my corner,"" said Manilov.","“In that case allow me to invite you into my study,” said Manilov, and he led him into a small room, the window of which looked out towards the forest, bluish in the distance. “This is my den,” said Manilov.","“That being so,” said Manilov, “allow me to invite you into my study.” And he led the way to a small room which faced the blue of the forest. “This is my sanctum,” he added.","“In that case allow me to invite you to my study,” said Manilov, and he led him to a small room with a window looking out on the bluing forest. “Here’s my little corner,” said Manilov.","“In that case allow me to invite you into my study,” said Manilov, and led him off to a small room, one of its windows looking out on the blue-tinged forest. “This is my den,” said Manilov."
"— Подите, говорю вам! — говорил он с тем неизъяснимым чувством отвращенья, какое чувствует человек при виде безобразнейшего насекомого, которого нет духу раздавить ногой. Он стряхнул так, что Чичиков почувствовал удар сапога в нос, губы и округленный подбородок, но не выпустил сапога и еще с большей силой держал ногу в своих объятьях. Два дюжих жандарма в силах оттащили его и, взявши под руки, повели через все комнаты. Он был бледный, убитый, в том бесчувственно-страшном состоянии, в каком бывает человек, видящий перед собою черную, неотвратимую смерть, это страшилище, противное естеству нашему…","- Come on, I tell you! he said with that inexplicable feeling of disgust, which a person feels at the sight of the most ugly insect, which there is no spirit to crush with his foot. He shook it off so that Chichikov felt the boot hit his nose, lips, and rounded chin, but he did not let go of the boot and held his leg in his arms with still greater force. Two burly gendarmes dragged him with all their strength and, taking him by the arms, led him through all the rooms. He was pale, dead, in that insensibly terrible state, in which a person sees a black, inevitable death in front of him, this monster, contrary to our nature ...","“Get away, I tell you!” said the prince, with that inexplicable feeling of repulsion which a man experiences at the sight of a hideous insect which he cannot bring himself to stamp upon. He shook himself so violently that Tchitchikov got a kick on his cheek, his agreeably rounded chin and teeth; but he did not let go of the foot, but pressed the boot still more warmly in his embrace. Two stalwart gendarmes dragged him away by force, and taking him under the arms led him through all the rooms. He was pale, shattered, in that numbly terrified condition in which a man is thrown who sees before him the black form of inevitable death, that monster so terrible and alien to our nature....","“Away with him, I say!” once more the Prince exclaimed with the sort of indefinable aversion which one feels at the sight of a repulsive insect which he cannot summon up the courage to crush with his boot. So convulsively did the Prince shudder that Chichikov, clinging to his leg, received a kick on the nose. Yet still the prisoner retained his hold; until at length a couple of burly gendarmes tore him away and, grasping his arms, hurried him—pale, dishevelled, and in that strange, half-conscious condition into which a man sinks when he sees before him only the dark, terrible figure of death, the phantom which is so abhorrent to all our natures—from the building.","“Away, I tell you!” he said, with that inexplicable feeling of disgust that a man feels at the sight of an extremely ugly insect that he does not have the courage to crush underfoot. He gave such a shake that Chichikov felt the boot strike his nose, lips, and nicely rounded chin, but he would not let go of the boot and held the leg still harder in his embrace. Two hefty policemen pulled him away by force, and, holding him under his arms, led him through all the rooms. He was pale, crushed, in the insensibly frightful state of a man who sees black, inescapable death before him, that fright which is contrary to our nature …",

"В молчанье они пошли все трое по дороге, по левую руку которой находилась мелькавшая промеж дерев белая каменная церковь, по правую — начинавшие показываться, также промеж дерев, строенья господского двора. Наконец показались и ворота. Они вступили на двор, где был старинный господский дом под высокой крышей. Две огромные липы, росшие посреди двора, покрывали почти половину его своею тенью. Сквозь опущенные вниз развесистые их ветви едва сквозили стены дома, находившегося позади их. Под липами стояло несколько длинных скамеек. Брат Василий пригласил Чичикова садиться. Чичиков сел, и Платонов сел. По всему двору разливалось благоуханье цветущих сиреней и черемух, которые, нависши отовсюду из саду в двор через миловидную березовую ограду, кругом его обходившую, казалися цветущею цепью или бисерным ожерельем, его короновавшим.","In silence, all three of them walked along the road, on the left hand of which there was a white stone church flashing between the trees, on the right - the buildings of the master's courtyard were beginning to appear, also between the trees. Finally the gate appeared. They entered the courtyard, where there was an old manor house with a high roof. Two huge linden trees that grew in the middle of the yard covered almost half of it with their shadow. Through their spreading branches lowered down, they could barely see through the walls of the house behind them. There were several long benches under the lime trees. Brother Vasily invited Chichikov to sit down. Chichikov sat down, and Platonov sat down. The fragrance of blooming lilacs and bird cherry trees spread throughout the yard, which, hanging from everywhere from the garden to the yard through a pretty birch fence that went around it, seemed like a flowering chain or a beaded necklace that crowned him.","In silence the three gentlemen walked along the road, on the left of which was the white church of which they had caught glimpses between the trees, and on the right, the buildings of a gentleman’s homestead began to come into sight through the trees. At last the gates too came into view. They walked into the yard where there was an old-fashioned high-roofed house. Two immense lime-trees standing in the middle of the yard wrapped almost half of it in their shade. The walls of the house could scarcely be seen through their luxuriant drooping branches. Under the lime-trees there were several long seats. Vassily Platonov asked Tchitchikov to sit down. Tchitchikov sat down and so did the younger brother. The whole yard was flooded with the fragrance of flowering lilacs and bird-cherries, which hanging over the pretty birch hedge from the garden on all sides into the yard looked like a flowery chain or a bead necklace wreathed about it.","The party turned to the right, and entered the gates of an ancient courtyard attached to an old-fashioned house of a type no longer built—the type which has huge gables supporting a high-pitched roof. In the centre of the courtyard two great lime trees covered half the surrounding space with shade, while beneath them were ranged a number of wooden benches, and the whole was encircled with a ring of blossoming lilacs and cherry trees which, like a beaded necklace, reinforced the wooden fence, and almost buried it beneath their clusters of leaves and flowers. The house, too, stood almost concealed by this greenery, except that the front door and the windows peered pleasantly through the foliage, and that here and there between the stems of the trees there could be caught glimpses of the kitchen regions, the storehouses, and the cellar. Lastly, around the whole stood a grove, from the recesses of which came the echoing songs of nightingales. Involuntarily the place communicated to the soul a sort of quiet, restful feeling, so eloquently did it speak of that care-free period when every one lived on good terms with his neighbour, and all was simple and unsophisticated. Vassili invited Chichikov to seat himself, and the party approached, for that purpose, the benches under the lime trees; after which a youth of about seventeen, and clad in a red shirt, brought decanters containing various kinds of kvass (some of them as thick as syrup, and others hissing like aerated lemonade), deposited the same upon the table, and, taking up a spade which he had left leaning against a tree, moved away towards the garden.","Silently the three of them walked down the road, to the left of which there was a white stone church flashing among the trees, and to the right the buildings of the master’s house, which were also beginning to appear among the trees. At last the gates appeared. They entered the courtyard, where stood the old manor house under its high roof. Two enormous lindens growing in the middle of the courtyard covered almost half of it with their shade. Through their low-hanging, bushy branches the walls of the house barely flickered from behind. Under the lindens stood several long benches. Brother Vassily invited Chichikov to be seated. Chichikov sat down, and Platonov sat down. The whole courtyard was filled with the fragrance of flowering lilacs and bird cherry, which, hanging from the garden into the yard on all sides over the very pretty birch fence that surrounded it, looked like a flowering chain or a bead necklace crowning it.",
"Чичиков сделался совершенно не в духе и швырнул на пол саблю, которая ездила с ним в дороге для внушения надлежащего страха кому следует. Около четверти часа с лишком провозился он с кузнецами, покамест сладил, потому что кузнецы, как водится, были отъявленные подлецы и, смекнув, что работа нужна к спеху, заломили ровно вшестеро. Как он ни горячился, называл их мошенниками, разбойниками, грабителями проезжающих, намекнул даже на страшный суд, но кузнецов ничем не пронял: они совершенно выдержали характер — не только не отступились от цены, но даже провозились за работой вместо двух часов целых пять с половиною. В продолжение этого времени он имел удовольствие испытать приятные минуты, известные всякому путешественнику, когда в чемодане все уложено и в комнате валяются только веревочки, бумажки да разный сор, когда человек не принадлежит ни к дороге, ни к сиденью на месте, видит из окна проходящих плетущихся людей, толкующих об своих гривнах и с каким-то глупым любопытством поднимающих глаза, чтобы, взглянув на него, опять продолжать свою дорогу, что еще более растравляет нерасположение духа бедного неедущего путешественника. Все, что ни есть, все, что ни видит он: и лавчонка против его окон, и голова старухи, живущей в супротивном доме, подходящей к окну с коротенькими занавесками, — все ему гадко, однако же он не отходит от окна. Стоит, то позабываясь, то обращая вновь какое-то притупленное внимание на все, что перед ним движется и не движется, и душит с досады какую-нибудь муху, которая в это время жужжит и бьется об стекло под его пальцем. Но всему бывает конец, и желанная минута настала: все было готово, перед у брички как следует был налажен, колесо было обтянуто новою шиною, кони приведены с водопоя, и разбойники кузнецы отправились, пересчитав полученные целковые и пожелав благополучия. Наконец и бричка была заложена, и два горячие калача, только что купленные, положены туда, и Селифан уже засунул кое-что для себя в карман, бывший у кучерских козел, и сам герой, наконец, при взмахивании картузом полового, стоявшего в том же демикотоновом сюртуке, при трактирных и чужих лакеях и кучерах, собравшихся позевать, как выезжает чужой барин, и при всяких других обстоятельствах, сопровождающих выезд, сел в экипаж, — и бричка, в которой ездят холостяки, которая так долго застоялась в городе и так, может быть, надоела читателю, наконец выехала из ворот гостиницы. «Слава те, господи» — подумал Чичиков и перекрестился. Селифан хлыснул кнутом; к нему подсел сперва повисевший несколько времени на подножке Петрушка, и герой наш, усевшись получше на грузинском коврике, заложил за спину себе кожаную подушку, притиснул два горячие калача, и экипаж пошел опять подплясывать и покачиваться благодаря мостовой, которая, как известно, имела подкидывающую силу. С каким-то неопределенным чувством глядел он на домы, стены, забор и улицы, которые также с своей стороны, как будто подскакивая, медленно уходили назад и которые, бог знает, судила ли ему участь увидеть еще когда-либо в продолжение своей жизни. При повороте в одну из улиц бричка должна была остановиться, потому что во всю длину ее проходила бесконечная погребальная процессия. Чичиков, высунувшись, велел Петрушке спросить, кого хоронят, и узнал, что хоронят прокурора. Исполненный неприятных ощущений, он тот же час спрятался в угол, закрыл себя кожею и задернул занавески. В это время, когда экипаж был таким образом остановлен, Селифан и Петрушка, набожно снявши шляпу, рассматривали, кто, как, в чем и на чем ехал, считая числом, сколько было всех и пеших и ехавших, а барин, приказавши им не признаваться и не кланяться никому из знакомых лакеев, тоже принялся рассматривать робко сквозь стеклышка, находившиеся в кожаных занавесках: за гробом шли, снявши шляпы, все чиновники. Он начал было побаиваться, чтобы не узнали его экипажа, но им было не до того. Они даже не занялись разными житейскими разговорами, какие обыкновенно ведут между собою провожающие покойника. Все мысли их были сосредоточены в это время в самих себе: они думали, каков-то будет новый генерал-губернатор, как возьмется за дело и как примет их. За чиновниками, шедшими пешком, следовали кареты, из которых выглядывали дамы в траурных чепцах. По движениям губ и рук их видно было, что они были заняты живым разговором; может быть, они тоже говорили о приезде нового генерал-губернатора и делали предположения насчет балов, какие он даст, и хлопотали о вечных своих фестончиках и нашивочках. Наконец за каретами следовало несколько пустых дрожек, вытянувшихся гуськом, наконец и ничего уже не осталось, и герой наш мог ехать. Открывши кожаные занавески, он вздохнул, произнесши от души: «Вот, прокурор! жил, жил, а потом и умер! И вот напечатают в газетах, что скончался, к прискорбию подчиненных и всего человечества, почтенный гражданин, редкий отец, примерный супруг, и много напишут всякой всячины; прибавят, пожалуй, что был сопровождаем плачем вдов и сирот; а ведь если разобрать хорошенько дело, так на поверку у тебя всего только и было, что густые брови». Тут он приказал Селифану ехать поскорее и между тем подумал про себя: «Это, однако ж, хорошо, что встретились похороны; говорят, значит счастие, если встретишь покойника».","Chichikov became completely out of sorts and threw down on the floor the saber that had traveled with him on the road in order to instill proper fear in anyone who should. For more than a quarter of an hour he fussed with the blacksmiths, for the time being he got it right, because the blacksmiths, as usual, were notorious scoundrels and, realizing that the work was needed in a hurry, broke down exactly six times. No matter how excited he was, he called them swindlers, robbers, robbers of those passing by, even hinted at the Last Judgment, but the blacksmiths did not get through with anything: they completely withstood their temper - not only did not back down from the price, but even worked at work instead of two hours for five and a half . During this time, he had the pleasure of experiencing the pleasant moments known to every traveler, when everything is packed in a suitcase and only strings, pieces of paper and various rubbish are lying around in the room, when a person does not belong either to the road or to the seat in place, sees people passing by from the window. trudging people, talking about their hryvnias and raising their eyes with some kind of stupid curiosity, so that, after looking at him, they again continue their journey, which even more irritates the unwilling spirit of the poor traveler who is not traveling. Everything that is, everything that he sees: both the shop opposite his windows, and the head of the old woman who lives in the opposite house, coming up to the window with short curtains - everything is disgusting to him, but he does not leave the window. He stands, now forgetting, now paying again some kind of blunted attention to everything that moves and does not move in front of him, and suffocates with annoyance some fly, which at that time buzzes and beats against the glass under his finger. But everything comes to an end, and the desired moment has come: everything was ready, the front of the britzka was properly adjusted, the wheel was covered with a new tire, the horses were brought from the watering place, and the blacksmith robbers set off, counting the rubles they received and wishing well-being. Finally, the britzka was laid, and two hot rolls, just bought, were put there, and Selifan had already stuffed something for himself into the pocket that was with the coachmen's goats, and the hero himself, finally, while waving the cap of the floor, standing in the same in a denim frock coat, in the presence of tavern and foreign footmen and coachmen, who had gathered to yawn, as a strange master leaves, and under all other circumstances accompanying the departure, he got into a carriage - and a britzka in which bachelors ride, which has stagnated in the city for so long and so, maybe tired the reader, finally drove out of the gates of the hotel. ""Glory to you, Lord,"" Chichikov thought, and crossed himself. Selifan lashed out with his whip; Petrushka, who at first hung on the footboard for some time, sat down next to him, and our hero, having sat better on the Georgian rug, laid a leather pillow behind his back, squeezed two hot rolls, and the carriage again went dancing and swaying thanks to the pavement, which, as you know, had a tossing up strength. With some kind of indefinite feeling he looked at the houses, the walls, the fence, and the streets, which, also from their side, as if jumping up, were slowly receding, and which, God knows, fate judged him to see again in the course of his life. When turning into one of the streets, the britzka had to stop, because an endless funeral procession passed along its entire length. Chichikov, leaning out, told Petrushka to ask who they were burying, and found out that they were burying the prosecutor. Filled with unpleasant sensations, he immediately hid in a corner, covered himself with skin and drew the curtains. At this time, when the carriage was thus stopped, Selifan and Petrushka, devoutly taking off their hats, considered who, how, in what and on what was riding, counting by number how many there were both on foot and on the road, and the master, ordering them not to confess and not bowing to any of the familiar lackeys, he also began to look timidly through the glass, which were in leather curtains: behind the coffin, all the officials, having taken off their hats, were walking. He began to be afraid that his crew would not be recognized, but they were not up to it. They did not even engage in various everyday conversations, which are usually carried on by those who see off the deceased. All their thoughts were concentrated at that time in themselves: they thought what the new governor-general would be like, how he would take up the matter and how he would accept them. The officials on foot were followed by carriages, from which ladies in mourning caps looked out. It was evident from the movements of their lips and hands that they were engaged in a lively conversation; perhaps they, too, were talking about the arrival of the new governor-general and speculating about the balls he would give, and fussing about their eternal festoons and stripes. Finally, several empty droshkys followed the carriages, stretched out in single file, and finally there was nothing left, and our hero could go. Opening the leather curtains, he sighed, saying from the bottom of his heart: “Here, prosecutor! lived, lived, and then died! And now they will publish in the newspapers that he died, to the regret of his subordinates and all mankind, a respectable citizen, a rare father, an exemplary husband, and they will write a lot of all sorts of things; add, perhaps, that he was accompanied by the weeping of widows and orphans; but if you take a good look at the matter, then in fact you only had thick eyebrows. Here he ordered Selifan to go as quickly as possible, and meanwhile he thought to himself: “It is, however, good that the funeral took place; they say it means happiness if you meet a dead person.","Tchitchikov felt thoroughly out of temper and threw down on the floor the sword that always travelled with him to inspire befitting terror wherever necessary. He was over a quarter of an hour bargaining with the blacksmiths before he could come to terms with them, for the blacksmiths, as usual, were arrant knaves, and seeing that the work was wanted in a hurry asked six times the proper price. Though he grew heated, called them swindlers and robbers who plundered travellers, and even referred to the Day of Judgment, he made no impression whatever on the blacksmiths, they stuck to their guns, not only refused to knock the price down but took five and a half hours over the work instead of two. During this time it was his pleasant lot to experience those agreeable moments, familiar to every traveller, when everything is packed and nothing but bits of string and paper and such rubbish is left lying about the room, when a man is neither on the road nor settled in one spot, when he looks out of window at the people passing up and down and talking of their gains and losses, and with a sort of vacant curiosity raising their eyes to stare at him and then going on their way, which further aggravates the ill humour of the poor traveller who cannot get off. Everything about him, everything he sees: the little shops opposite his windows and the head of the old woman opposite, as she goes up to the window with the short curtains —it is all distasteful to him, and yet he does not move away from the window. He stands there sometimes lost in oblivion, sometimes again paying a sort of dull attention to everything moving and unmoving about him, and in his vexation crushes a fly which buzzes and beats against the widow-pane under his finger. But there is an end to everything and the longed-for moment arrived, everything was ready, the front part of the chaise had been properly repaired, the wheels had new tires, the horses had been brought back from the drinking place, and the rascally blacksmiths departed, counting over their roubles and wishing him a good journey. At last the chaise was packed and two fancy loaves, hot from the baker‘s, had been put in, and Selifan had stuffed something for himself in the pocket in the coachman’s box, and finally, while the waiter in the same cotton shoddy coat waved his cap, while the assembled waiters from the restaurants and coachmen and other servants stood gaping at the departure of some one else’s master, amid the various other circumstances attendant on departure, our hero got into his carriage, and the chaise—of the pattern favoured by bachelor gentlemen of the middling sort—which had so long been stationary in the town, and with which the reader is perhaps so bored, at last drove out of the gates of the hotel. “Thank God,” thought Tchitchikov, and he crossed himself. Selifan cracked his whip, Petrushka after first hanging on for some time on the step, sat down beside him, and our hero, settling himself more comfortably in his Georgian rug and flattening the two hot loaves together, thrust the leather pillow behind his back, and the chaise fell to jolting and hopping up and down again, thanks to the cobble-stones which had, as the reader knows, wonderful resilient properties. With a vague, undefined feeling he looked at the houses, the walls, the fences and the streets, which seeming to dance up and down too, gradually retreated, and which there was no knowing whether he was fated to see again in his life. At a turning in one of the streets the chaise had to pull up because an endless funeral procession was passing up the whole length of it. Tchitchikov, putting his head out, told Petrushka to inquire whose funeral it was, and learned that it was the prosecutor’s. Overcome by an unpleasant feeling he hid himself in the corner, covered himself with the leather apron, and pulled the curtain over the window. While the chaise was held up, Selifan and Petrushka, devoutly taking off their hats, were looking to see who were driving or riding, and how and in or on what they were doing so, counting how many there were on foot and in carriages, and their master, bidding them not greet or recognise any of their acquaintances, began timidly looking too through the little pane in the leather curtain. All the officials walked bareheaded after the coffin. He began to be afraid that his carriage might be recognised, but no one noticed it. They were not even indulging in the trivial talk which is usually kept up by persons attending a funeral. At that moment all their thoughts were concentrated on themselves: they were wondering what the new governor-general would be like, how he would set to work and how he would take them. The officials who were walking were followed by carriages out of which peeped ladies in mourning caps. From the movements of their hands and lips, it could be seen that they were engaged in eager conversation: possibly they, too, were discussing the arrival of the governor-general, and speculating about the balls he would give, and were busily chattering about their everlasting festoons and frills. Then the carriages were followed by a file of empty droshkys, and at last there was nothing left to come, so that our hero could drive on. Drawing back the leather curtain, he heaved a sigh, and exclaimed from his heart: “So much for the prosecutor! He lived and lived and then he died! And now they will print in the newspapers that he has passed away to the grief of his subordinates and of all humanity, an honoured citizen, a devoted father, a faithful husband, and they will write all sorts of nonsense; they will very likely add that he was followed to the grave by the lamentations of widows and orphans; and yet if one goes into the facts of the case, it turns out on investigation that there was nothing special about you but your thick eyebrows.” Here he told Selifan to drive faster, while he thought to himself, “Well, it is a good thing we met the funeral, they say meeting a funeral means happiness.”","Selifan departed, and Chichikov, his ill-humour vented, threw down upon the floor the poignard which he always took with him as a means of instilling respect into whomsoever it might concern, and spent the next quarter of an hour in disputing with a couple of blacksmiths—men who, as usual, were rascals of the type which, on perceiving that something is wanted in a hurry, at once multiplies its terms for providing the same. Indeed, for all Chichikov’s storming and raging as he dubbed the fellows robbers and extortioners and thieves, he could make no impression upon the pair, since, true to their character, they declined to abate their prices, and, even when they had begun their work, spent upon it, not two hours, but five and a half. Meanwhile he had the satisfaction of experiencing that delightful time with which all travellers are familiar—namely, the time during which one sits in a room where, except for a litter of string, waste paper, and so forth, everything else has been packed. But to all things there comes an end, and there arrived also the long-awaited moment when the britchka had received the luggage , the faulty wheel had been fitted with a new tyre, the horses had been re-shod, and the predatory blacksmiths had departed with their gains. “Thank God!” thought Chichikov as the britchka rolled out of the gates of the inn, and the vehicle began to jolt over the cobblestones. Yet a feeling which he could not altogether have defined filled his breast as he gazed upon the houses and the streets and the garden walls which he might never see again. Presently, on turning a corner, the britchka was brought to a halt through the fact that along the street there was filing a seemingly endless funeral procession. Leaning forward in his britchka, Chichikov asked Petrushka whose obsequies the procession represented, and was told that they represented those of the Public Prosecutor. Disagreeably shocked, our hero hastened to raise the hood of the vehicle, to draw the curtains across the windows, and to lean back into a corner. While the britchka remained thus halted Selifan and Petrushka, their caps doffed, sat watching the progress of the cortege, after they had received strict instructions not to greet any fellow-servant whom they might recognise. Behind the hearse walked the whole body of tchinovniks, bare-headed; and though, for a moment or two, Chichikov feared that some of their number might discern him in his britchka, he need not have disturbed himself, since their attention was otherwise engaged. In fact, they were not even exchanging the small talk customary among members of such processions, but thinking exclusively of their own affairs, of the advent of the new Governor-General, and of the probable manner in which he would take up the reins of administration. Next came a number of carriages, from the windows of which peered the ladies in mourning toilets. Yet the movements of their hands and lips made it evident that they were indulging in animated conversation—probably about the Governor-General, the balls which he might be expected to give, and their own eternal fripperies and gewgaws. Lastly came a few empty drozhkis. As soon as the latter had passed, our hero was able to continue on his way. Throwing back the hood of the britchka, he said to himself: “Ah, good friend, you have lived your life, and now it is over! In the newspapers they will say of you that you died regretted not only by your subordinates, but also by humanity at large, as well as that, a respected citizen, a kind father, and a husband beyond reproach, you went to your grave amid the tears of your widow and orphans. Yet, should those journals be put to it to name any particular circumstance which justified this eulogy of you, they would be forced to fall back upon the fact that you grew a pair of exceptionally thick eyebrows!” With that Chichikov bid Selifan quicken his pace, and concluded: “After all, it is as well that I encountered the procession, for they say that to meet a funeral is lucky.”","Chichikov was completely out of sorts and flung down on the floor the sword that traveled with him for inspiring due fear in those who needed it. He fussed with the blacksmiths for a good quarter of an hour before he could come to terms with them, because the blacksmiths, as is their wont, were inveterate scoundrels, and, having grasped that the job was an urgent one, stuck him with six times the price. He got all fired up, called them crooks, thieves, highway robbers, even hinted at the Last Judgment, but nothing fazed them: the blacksmiths stayed absolutely in character—not only did not yield on the price, but even fussed over the work for a whole five and a half hours instead of two. During that time he had the pleasure of experiencing those agreeable moments, familiar to every traveler, when the trunk is all packed and only strings, scraps of paper, and various litter are strewn about the room, when a man belongs neither to the road nor to sitting in place, and from the window sees people plodding by, discussing nickels and dimes, lifting their eyes with some stupid curiosity to glance at him and then continuing on their way, which further aggravates the low spirits of the poor non-departing traveler. Everything there, everything he sees—the little shop across from his windows, the head of the old woman who lives in the house opposite, and who keeps coming up to the window with its half-curtains—everything is loathsome to him, and yet he will not leave the window. He stands, now oblivious, now dimly attentive again to everything moving and not moving in front of him, and in vexation stifles under his finger some fly which at the moment is buzzing and beating against the glass. But there is an end to all things, and the longed-for moment came: everything was ready, the front end of the britzka was set to rights, the wheel was fitted with a new tire, the horses were brought from the watering place, and the robber-blacksmiths went off counting the roubles they had made and wishing him all their blessings. Finally the britzka, too, was harnessed, and two hot kalatchi, only just bought, were put in, and Selifan stuck something for himself into the pouch in the coachman’s box, and finally the hero himself, to the waving cap of the floorboy, who stood there in the same half-cotton frock coat, in the presence of the tavern servants and other lackeys and coachmen, who gathered to gape at someone else’s master departing, and with all the other circumstances that accompany a departure, got into the carriage—and the britzka such as bachelors drive around in, which had stood so long in town and which the reader is so sick of, finally drove out the gates of the inn. “Thank God for that!” thought Chichikov, crossing himself. Selifan cracked his whip; Petrushka, having first hung from the footboard for a while, sat down next to him, and our hero, settling himself better on the Georgian rug, put a leather cushion behind his back and squashed the two kalatchi, as the carriage again started its jigging and jolting, owing to the pavement, which, as we know, possessed a bouncing force. With a sort of indefinite feeling he gazed at the houses, walls, fences, and streets, which, also as if hopping for their own part, were slowly moving backwards, and which God knows if he was destined to see again in the course of his life. At a turn down one of the streets the britzka had to stop, because an endless funeral procession was passing the whole length of it. Chichikov, having peeked out, told Petrushka to ask who was being buried, and learned that it was the prosecutor. Filled with unpleasant sensations, he at once hid himself in a corner, covered himself with the leather apron, and closed the curtains. All the while the carriage was stopped in this way, Selifan and Petrushka, piously doffing their hats, were looking at who drove how, in what, and on what, counting the number of all those on foot and on wheels, while the master, ordering them not to acknowledge or greet any servants they knew, also began timidly looking through the glass in the leather curtains: behind the coffin, hats off, walked all the officials. He began to be a bit afraid that they might recognize his carriage, but they could not be bothered with that. They were not even occupied with the various mundane conversations that are usually conducted among those accompanying the deceased. All their thoughts at that time were concentrated on their own selves: they thought about what sort of man the new governor-general would be, how he would get down to business, and how he would receive them. After the officials, who went on foot, came carriages out of which peeked ladies in mourning caps. By the movement of their lips and hands one could see that they were engaged in lively conversation; perhaps they, too, were talking about the arrival of the new governor-general, making speculations concerning the balls he would give, and worrying about their eternal festoons and appliqués. Finally, after the carriages, came several empty droshkies, strung out in single file, and finally there was nothing more left, and our hero could go. Opening the leather curtains, he sighed, saying from the bottom of his heart: “So, the prosecutor! He lived and lived, and then he died! And so they’ll print in the newspapers that there passed away, to the sorrow of his subordinates and of all mankind, a respectable citizen, a rare father, an exemplary husband, and they’ll write all sorts of stuff; they’ll add, maybe, that he was accompanied by the weeping of widows and orphans; but if one looks into the matter properly, all you had, in fact, was bushy eyebrows.” Here he told Selifan to drive faster, and meanwhile thought to himself: “It’s a good thing, however, that I met the funeral; they say it’s a lucky sign when you meet a dead man.”","Chichikov became thoroughly upset and threw to the floor the sword which accompanied him on all his travels, to inspire appropriate awe whenever necessary. For more than a quarter of an hour did he fuss and bother with the blacksmiths until he came to terms with them, since the blacksmiths were, as usual, out-and-out knaves and, having surmised that the work was urgently needed, had jacked up their price exactly sixfold. No matter how heated he became, calling them swindlers, robbers, highwaymen, even hinting at what would happen to them on dread Judgment Day, he didn’t penetrate their hides at all; they ran utterly true to form: not only did they not abate their price, they even fussed around with their work, not for two hours, but for all of five and a half. During this time Chichikov had the pleasure of experiencing those delectable moments which every traveler is familiar with, when everything has been packed away in the trunk and there is nothing in the room except bits of string, scraps of paper, and all sorts of trash littering the floor; when a man belongs neither to the road nor to any settled place, as he watches through the window the passers-by shuffling along and discussing their picayune affairs, as they lift up their eyes with some sort of silly curiosity to look at him, then go on their way again, which irritates still more the bad spirits of the traveler who isn’t traveling. Everything around him, everything that meets his eye—the wretched little shop opposite his windows, and the head of an old woman who lives in the house across the way, as she walks up to her window with its short curtains—everything is repulsive to him, yet go away from the window he will not. He stands there, now oblivious, now turning anew a sort of dulled attentiveness upon everything before him, whether it is moving or not, and out of vexation he will crush some poor fly that persists in buzzing and beating against the win-dowpane even as he crushes it. But there is an end to all things, and the longed-for moment arrived. Everything was in readiness; the front of the carriage had been properly repaired; a new iron rim had been adjusted around the wheel, the horses were brought from their watering, and the brigand blacksmiths went off, after having counted over their silver rubles and having wished Chichikov godspeed. Finally the carriage itself was harnessed, and two hot, twisted loaves, just purchased, were placed therein, and Selifan had already thrust a thing or two for himself in the pouch next to his seat, and, while the tavern server in his invariable twill jacket stood by and waved his cap in farewell, and while sundry other flunkies and coachmen, from the tavern as well as outsiders, gathered to gape at someone else’s master departing, and amid all the other circumstances usually attendant upon a departure, our hero at last seated himself in the vehicle, and the light carriage, of the sort that bachelors ride in, which had for so long been stalled in the town, and which the reader may have become so fed up with by now, at last rolled out of the gates of the inn. “Glory be to God!” Chichikov reflected and crossed himself. Selifan lashed out with his whip; Petrushka, who had been hanging on the footboard for some time, got up on the seat beside him, and our hero, seating himself more comfortably upon a small Georgian rug, put a leather cushion back of him, incidentally crushing the two hot loaves, and the vehicle was once more bouncing and swaying along, thanks to the pavement, which, as we know, had a resilient force. With some sort of undefined emotion did he look upon the houses, the walls, the fences, and the streets, all of which also seemed to be bouncing and swaying as they slowly fell behind, and God knows if he were ever fated to see all these things again during his whole life. At a turn into one of the streets the carriage had to stop, because an endless funeral procession was passing down its whole length. Chichikov, leaning out, bade Petrushka ask whose funeral it was and learned it was the Public Prosecutor’s. Filled with unpleasant sensations, he immediately hid himself in a corner, pulling the leather apron over himself and drawing the curtains to. At this point, while the vehicle was thus halted, Selifan and Petrushka, with their hats piously doffed, were observing who was present, how everything was going, who was riding and who was driving, what they were riding or driving, reckoning up the number of all the folk there, both afoot and riding, while their master, having enjoined them not to recognize and not to return the salutes of any of their acquaintances among the coachmen and footmen, also began diffidently observing things through the little glass panes in the leather curtains. The coffin was followed by all the officials, on foot and bareheaded. Chichikov became apprehensive lest they recognize his carriage, but the officials had other things on their minds. They were not even engaged in the varied workaday small talk, such as those escorting a dead man usually carry on among themselves. All their thoughts at this juncture were concentrated on themselves: they were thinking of what the new Governor-General would be like now, how he would set about his work, and what reception they would get at his hands. Behind the officials came the carriages, driving at a walk, out of which the ladies, in mourning caps, were peeping. By the movements of their lips and hands one could see that they were taken up with animated talk; it may even be that they, too, were talking about the coming of the new Governor-General, and speculating as to what balls he would give, and were taken up with their eternal little scallops and their darling appliques. Finally, behind the carriages followed several empty droshkies, stretched out in single file; at last there was nothing more, and our hero could drive on. Drawing back the leather curtains, he heaved a sigh and uttered: “There, the Public Prosecutor lived on and on, and then he up and died! And now they will print in the papers that a respected citizen, a rare father, an exemplary spouse, has departed this life to the great sorrow of his subordinates and of all mankind, and what sort of stuff won’t they write! They’ll add, likely as not, that he was followed to his grave by the lamentations of widows and orphans, and yet, if one were to go into this matter rather thoroughly, why, on investigation it would turn out that all there really was to you was your bushy eyebrows.” Here he ordered Selifan to drive on faster and in the meantime reflected: “That’s a good thing, though, meeting this funeral; they say meeting a dead man is an omen of good luck.”"

So this is their innocence!”","“So much, then, for educating girls like the Governor’s daughter at school!

"— Послушайте-с, Павел Иванович, — сказал он, — я привез вам свободу на таком условии, чтобы сейчас вас не было в городе. Собирайте все пожитки свои — да и с богом, не откладывая ни минуту, потому что дело еще хуже. Я знаю-с, вас тут один человек настраивает; так объявляю вам по секрету, что такое еще дело одно открывается, что уж никакие силы не спасут этого. Он, конечно, рад других топить, чтобы нескучно, да дело к разделке. Я вас оставил в расположенье хорошем, — лучшем, нежели в каком теперь. Советую вам-с не в шутку. Ей-ей дело не в этом имуществе, из-за которого спорят и режут друг друга люди, точно как можно завести благоустройство в здешней жизни, не помысливши о другой жизни. Поверьте-с, Павел Иванович, что покамест, брося все то, из-за чего грызут и едят друг друга на земле, не подумают о благоустройстве душевного имущества, не установится благоустройство и земного имущества. Наступят времена голода и бедности как во всем народе, так и порознь во всяком… Это-с ясно. Что ни говорите, ведь от души зависит тело. Как же хотеть, чтобы шло как следует. Подумайте не о мертвых душах, а о своей живой душе, да и с богом на другую дорогу! Я тож выезжаю завтрашний день. Поторопитесь! не то без меня беда будет.","“Listen, sir, Pavel Ivanovich,” he said, “I have brought you freedom on the condition that you are not in the city now. Pack up all your belongings, and with God, without delay, because things are even worse. I know, sir, one person here is setting you up; so I announce to you in confidence that such another case is being opened, that no forces will save it. He, of course, is happy to drown others, so that it’s not boring, but it’s up to cutting. I have left you in a good disposition, better than what you are now. I advise you, not in jest. She-she doesn't care about this property, because of which people argue and cut each other, just like you can bring improvement in this life without thinking about another life. Believe me, Pavel Ivanovich, that for the time being, having abandoned everything that is why they gnaw and eat each other on earth, they will not think about the improvement of spiritual property, the improvement of earthly property will not be established. There will come times of famine and poverty, both among the whole people, and separately in every one ... This is clear. Whatever you say, the body depends on the soul. How do you want things to go right. Think not about dead souls, but about your living soul, and with God, to another road! I am also leaving tomorrow. Hurry up! not that without me the trouble will be.","“Listen, Pavel Ivanovitch,” he said: “I have brought you freedom on condition that you leave the town at once. Collect all your belongings and go in God’s name, without putting it off for a minute, for something worse is coming. I know there is a man who is behind you; so I must tell you in secret that there is something else being discovered, and that no power will save that man now. He of course is glad to drag others down for company and to share the blame. I left you in a very good frame of mind, better than your present one. I am advising you in earnest. Aie, aie, what really matters is not the possessions over which men dispute and for which they murder each other, exactly as though it were possible to gain prosperity in this life without thinking of another life. Believe me, Pavel Ivanovitch, that until men reject everything for which men rend and devour each other on earth, and think of the welfare of their spiritual possessions, it will not be well even with their earthly possessions. Days of hunger and poverty are coming for all the people, and each one severally ... that is clear. Whatever you say, you know, the body depends on the soul, how then can you expect things to thrive as they ought? Think not of dead souls but of your own living soul, and in God’s name take a different path! I too am leaving the town on the morrow. Make haste or when I am gone there will be trouble.”","“Listen, Paul Ivanovitch,” the old man said. “I bring you your freedom, but only on this condition—that you depart out of the town forthwith. Therefore gather together your effects, and waste not a moment, lest worse befall you. Also, of all that a certain person has contrived to do on your behalf I am aware; wherefore let me tell you, as between ourselves, that should the conspiracy come to light, nothing on earth can save him, and in his fall he will involve others rather then be left unaccompanied in the lurch, and not see the guilt shared. How is it that when I left you recently you were in a better frame of mind than you are now? I beg of you not to trifle with the matter. Ah me! what boots that wealth for which men dispute and cut one another’s throats? Do they think that it is possible to prosper in this world without thinking of the world to come? Believe me when I say that, until a man shall have renounced all that leads humanity to contend without giving a thought to the ordering of spiritual wealth, he will never set his temporal goods either upon a satisfactory foundation. Yes, even as times of want and scarcity may come upon nations, so may they come upon individuals. No matter what may be said to the contrary, the body can never dispense with the soul. Why, then, will you not try to walk in the right way, and, by thinking no longer of dead souls, but only of your only living one, regain, with God’s help, the better road? I too am leaving the town to-morrow. Hasten, therefore, lest, bereft of my assistance, you meet with some dire misfortune.”","“Listen, Pavel Ivanovich, sir,” he said, “I am bringing you freedom, on condition that you leave town at once. Get all your belongings ready—and go with God, don’t put it off for a moment, because things are worse than you think. I know, sir, that there’s a man here who is inciting you ; I tell you in secret that yet another case is developing here, and that no powers will save him. He is glad, of course, to drag others down, so as not to be bored, but things are getting sorted out. I left you in a good state of mind—better than you’re in now. My advice is not offered lightly. By God, the point is not in this property, on account of which people argue and stab each other, as if one could have well-being in this life without thinking about the next. Believe me, Pavel Ivanovich, sir, until people abandon all that they wrangle over and eat each other for on earth, and think about the well-being of their spiritual property, there won’t be any well-being of earthly property. There will be times of hunger and poverty, as much for all the people as for each one separately … That is clear, sir. Whatever you say, the body does depend on the soul. How then can you want things to go properly? Think not about dead souls, but about your living soul, and God help you on a different path! I, too, am leaving tomorrow. Hurry! or without me there will be trouble.”",

"И до такой ничтожности, мелочности, гадости мог снизойти человек! мог так измениться! И похоже это на правду? Все похоже на правду, все может статься с человеком.

Take with you on your journey, emerging from your soft youthful years into a stern, hardening courage, take with you all human movements, do not leave them on the road, do not pick them up later! Terrible, terrible is the coming old age ahead, and gives nothing back and back!

As you pass from the soft years of youth into harsh, hardening manhood, be sure you take with you on the way all the humane emotions, do not leave them on the road: you will not pick them up again afterwards! Old age is before you, threatening and terrible, and it will give you nothing back again!

So changed he can become! Does this resemble the truth? Everything resembles the truth, everything can happen to a man. The now ardent youth would jump back in horror if he were shown his own portrait in old age. So take with you on your way, as you pass from youth’s tender years into stern, hardening manhood, take with you every humane impulse, do not leave them by the wayside, you will not pick them up later! Terrible, dreadful old age looms ahead, and nothing does it give back again! The grave is more merciful, on the grave it will be written: “Here lies a man!”—but nothing can be read in the cold, unfeeling features of inhuman old age.","And is it to such insignificance, such pettiness, such vileness that a man could sink? Could a man change to such an extent? And does all this have any verisimilitude? All this has verisimilitude, all this can befall a man. The fiery youth of the present would recoil in horror were you to show him a portrait of himself in his old age. Take along with you, then, on setting out upon your way, as you emerge from the gentle years of youth into stern, coarsening manhood, take along with you all the humane impulses, abandon them not on the road; you will never retrieve them after! Sinister, fearsome is the old age that will come upon you farther along the way, and it never releases aught nor ever aught returns! The grave is more merciful than it; upon the grave will be inscribed: Here Lies a Man, but naught will you read upon the frigid, insensate features of inhuman old age."

"— «Приступая к обдумыванью возложенного на меня вашим высокородием поручения, честь имею сим донести на оное: 1) В самой просьбе господина коллежского советника и кавалера Павла Ивановича Чичикова есть уже некоторое недоразумение: в изъясненье того, что требуются ревизские души, постигнутые всякими внезапностями, вставлены и умершие. Под сим, вероятно, они изволили разуметь близкие к смерти, а не умершие; ибо умершие не приобретаются. Что ж и приобретать, если ничего нет? Об этом говорит и самая логика. Да и в словесных науках они, как видно, не далеко уходили…» — Тут на минуту Кошкарев остановился и сказал: — В этом месте, плут… он немножко кольнул вас. Но судите, однако же, какое бойкое перо — статс-секретарский слог; а ведь всего три года побыл в университете, даже не кончил курса. — Кошкарев продолжал: — «…в словесных науках, как видно, не далеко… ибо выразились о душах умершие, тогда как всякому, изучавшему курс познаний человеческих, известно заподлинно, что душа бессмертна. 2) Оных упомянутых ревижских душ, пришлых, или прибылых, или, как они неправильно изволили выразиться, умерших, нет налицо таковых, которые бы не были в залоге, ибо все в совокупности не только заложены без изъятия, но и перезаложены, с прибавкой по полутораста рублей на душу, кроме небольшой деревни Гурмайловка, находящейся в спорном положении по случаю тяжбы с помещиком Предищевым, и потому ни в продажу, ни в залог поступить не может».","- “Starting to consider the assignment entrusted to me by your nobility, I have the honor to convey to this: 1) In the very request of Mr. Collegiate Counselor and Cavalier Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, there is already some misunderstanding: in explaining that revision souls are required, comprehended by all sorts of surprises, inserted and dead. By this, they probably deigned to understand those close to death, and not the dead; for the dead are not acquired. What to buy if there is nothing? This is what the logic says. Yes, and in the verbal sciences, they apparently did not go far ... ”- Here Koshkarev stopped for a minute and said:“ In this place, rogue ... he pricked you a little. But judge, however, what a brisk pen is a state secretary syllable; and after all, he spent only three years at the university, he did not even finish the course. - Koshkarev continued: - “... in the verbal sciences, apparently, not far ... for the souls of the dead have expressed themselves, while anyone who has studied the course of human knowledge knows for sure that the soul is immortal. 2) These mentioned Revizh souls, newcomers, or arrived, or, as they incorrectly expressed themselves, dead, there are none that would not be pledged, for all together are not only pledged without withdrawal, but also re-mortgaged, with an increase of one and a half hundred rubles per capita, except for the small village of Gurmailovka, which is in a disputed situation on the occasion of a lawsuit with the landowner Predishchev, and therefore cannot be sold or pledged.","“ ‘In reference to the commission that your honour has entrusted to me I have the honour herewith to report as follows: 1. In the very petition of the collegiate councillor and cavalier, Pavel Ivanovitch Tchitchikov, there is some misunderstanding: inasmuch as souls are required that have been assailed by various sudden calamities, and died. Thereby, doubtless, he signifies those on the point of death, not actually dead; seeing that the dead cannot be obtained. How can a thing be purchased if it does not exist. Logic itself tells us that and evidently the gentleman has not gone very far in the study of the humanities.’ ” Here for a moment Koshkaryov stopped and said: “In this passage the rogue certainly scores off you. But he has a smart pen, hasn’t he, and yet he has only been three years at the university , in fact he did not finish his education.” Koshkaryov continued: “ ‘He has not gone far, as is evident, in the study of the humanities... for he has used the expression ”dead souls,“ while every one who has completed a course of humane studies, knows for a fact that the soul is immortal. 2. Of the aforementioned souls, acquired by purchase or otherwise, or, as the gentleman incorrectly expresses it, dead, there are none that have not only been mortgaged, seeing that all without exception have been not only mortgaged but re-mortgaged for an additional hundred and fifty roubles a soul, except the little village of ”Gurmailovka,“ which is in a doubtful position owing to the lawsuit with the landowner, Predishtchev, and so cannot be sold or mortgaged.’ ”","“‘After giving full consideration to the Reference which your Excellency has entrusted to me, I have the honour to report as follows: “‘(1) In the Statement of Plea presented by one Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, Gentleman, Chevalier, and Collegiate Councillor, there lurks an error, in that an oversight has led the Petitioner to apply to Revisional Souls the term “Dead.” Now, from the context it would appear that by this term the Petitioner desires to signify Souls Approaching Death rather than Souls Actually Deceased: wherefore the term employed betrays such an empirical instruction in letters as must, beyond doubt, have been confined to the Village School, seeing that in truth the Soul is Deathless.’ “The rascal!” Koshkarev broke off to exclaim delightedly. “He has got you there, Monsieur Chichikov. And you will admit that he has a sufficiently incisive pen? “‘(2) On this Estate there exist no Unmortgaged Souls whatsoever, whether Approaching Death or Otherwise; for the reason that all Souls thereon have been pledged not only under a First Deed of Mortgage, but also (for the sum of One Hundred and Fifty Roubles per Soul) under a Second,—the village of Gurmailovka alone excepted, in that, in consequence of a Suit having been brought against Landowner Priadistchev, and of a caveat having been pronounced by the Land Court, and of such caveat having been published in No. 42 of the Gazette of Moscow, the said Village has come within the Jurisdiction of the Court Above-Mentioned.”","“Setting about the consideration of the assignment I have been charged with by Your Honor, I have the privilege herewith to report on the above: (1) The very request of Mister Collegiate Councillor Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, Esquire, contains a certain misunderstanding: in the explanation of the demand for registered souls overtaken by various unexpectednesses, those who have died were also included. This was most probably meant to indicate those nearing death, and not those who have died; for those who have died are not purchasable. What is there to purchase, if there’s nothing? Logic itself tells us as much. And in literary sciences, as is obvious, he never got very far …” Here Koshkarev paused momentarily and said: “At this point, the sly-boots … he needles you a little. But consider what a glib pen—the style of a state secretary; and he was at the university only three years, and hasn’t even finished the course.” Koshkarev went on: “… in literary sciences, as is obvious, he never got very far, for he speaks of the souls as dead, while anyone who has taken a course in human knowledge knows for a certainty that the soul is immortal. (2) Of the above-mentioned registered souls, prescribed, or prescinded, or, as he is pleased to put it incorrectly, dead, there are none present who are not mortgaged, for they are not only all mortgaged without exception, in their totality, but they are also re-mortgaged for an additional hundred and fifty roubles per soul, except for the small village of Gurmailovka, which is in dispute on occasion of the lawsuit of the landowner Predishchev, and therefore can be neither purchased nor mortgaged.”",

"— А вот же поймал, нарочно поймал! — отвечал Ноздрев — Теперь я поведу тебя посмотреть, — продолжал он, обращаясь к Чичикову, — границу, где оканчивается моя земля.","- But I caught it, I caught it on purpose! answered Nozdryov. “Now I will take you to see,” he continued, turning to Chichikov, “the border where my land ends.","“But I say I did catch one, I caught one on purpose!” answered Nozdryov. “Now,” he said, addressing Tchitchikov, “I am going to take you to see the boundaries of my property.”","“But I DID” reiterated Nozdrev. “However, let me show you the boundary where my lands come to an end.”","“But I did catch one, I caught one on purpose!” replied Nozdryov. “Now,” he went on, turning to Chichikov, “I’ll take you for a look at the boundary where my land ends.”",“But I tell you I caught one; I deliberately caught one!” Nozdrev answered him. “Now I’m going to take you”—he turned to Chichikov— “to see the boundary line where my land ends.”

"В продолжение всей болтовни Ноздрева Чичиков протирал несколько раз себе глаза, желая увериться, не во сне ли он все это слышит. Делатель фальшивых ассигнаций, увоз губернаторской дочки, смерть прокурора, которой причиною будто бы он, приезд генерал-губернатора — все это навело на него порядочный испуг. «Ну, уж коли пошло на то, — подумал он сам в себе, — так мешкать более нечего, нужно отсюда убираться поскорей».","In the course of all Nozdryov's chatter, Chichikov rubbed his eyes several times, wanting to make sure that he was not hearing all this in a dream. The maker of counterfeit banknotes, the abduction of the governor's daughter, the death of the prosecutor, which he allegedly caused, the arrival of the governor-general - all this caused him a decent fright. “Well, if it comes to that,” he thought to himself, “there is nothing more to delay, we need to get out of here as soon as possible.”","While Nozdryov was rattling on, Tchitchikov several times rubbed his eyes to make sure that he was not hearing all this in a dream. The charge of forging counterfeit notes, the elopement with the governor’s daughter, the death of the prosecutor, of which Tchitchikov was supposed to be the cause, the arrival of the new governor-general—all this excited considerable alarm. “Well, if it has come to this,” he thought to himself, “it’s no good lingering on here, I must make haste and get away.”","Throughout Nozdrev’s maunderings Chichikov had been rubbing his eyes to ascertain whether or not he was dreaming. What with the charge of being a forger, the accusation of having schemed an abduction, the death of the Public Prosecutor (whatever might have been its cause), and the advent of a new Governor-General, he felt utterly dismayed. “Things having come to their present pass,” he reflected, “I had better not linger here—I had better be off at once.”","In the course of all Nozdryov’s babble, Chichikov rubbed his eyes several times, wanting to be sure he was not hearing it all in a dream. The making of forged banknotes, the carrying off of the governor’s daughter, the death of the prosecutor, of which he was supposedly the cause, the arrival of the governor-general—all this produced quite a decent fright in him. “Well, if things have come to that,” he thought to himself, “there’s no point in lingering, I must get myself out of here.”","All the time that Nozdrev was chattering away Chichikov had kept rubbing his eyes, wishing to make sure whether he were hearing all this in a dream or in reality. Turning out counterfeit notes, abduction of the Governor’s daughter, the death of the Public Prosecutor, of which he was apparently the cause, arrival of the Governor-General—all these statements had thrown him into a considerable fright. “Well, if things have come to such a pass,” he thought to himself, “then there’s no use hanging around here; I’ll have to make tracks out of here as fast as I can.”"
"— Что ж могу я сделать? Я должен воевать с законом. Положим, если бы я даже и решился на это, но ведь князь справедлив, — он ни за что не отступит.","- What can I do? I have to fight the law. Let's suppose that even if I decided on this, but the prince is just, he will not back down for anything.","“What can I do? I should have to fight against the law. Even supposing I brought myself to do that, the prince is a just man, nothing would induce him to transgress it.”","“How can I do that? So to do I should need to procure the setting aside of a law. Again, even if I were to make the attempt, the Prince is a strict administrator, and would refuse on any consideration to release you.”","“But what can I do? I would have to fight with the law.

"— Признаюсь, — сказал Чичиков, наклоня голову набок и взявщись рукою за ручку кресел, — еду я, покамест, не столько но своей нужде, сколько по нужде другого. Генерал Бетрищев, близкий приятель и, можно сказать, благотворитель, просил навестить родственников. Родственники, конечно, родственниками, но отчасти, так сказать, и для самого себя; потому что, точно, не говоря уже о пользе, которая может быть в геморроидальном отношенье, одно уже то, чтоб увидать свет, коловращенье люден… кто что ни говори, есть так сказать, живая книга, та же наука.","""I confess,"" said Chichikov, tilting his head to one side and grasping the arm of his chair with his hand, ""for the time being, I am going not so much for my own needs as for the needs of another."" General Betrishchev, a close friend and, one might say, a philanthropist, asked to visit his relatives. Relatives, of course, relatives, but partly, so to speak, and for oneself; because, for sure, not to mention the benefits that can be in a hemorrhoidal relationship, one thing is to see the light, the gyration of people ... whatever you say, there is, so to speak, a living book, the same science.","“I must own,” said Tchitchikov, putting his head on one side and grasping the arm of his chair, “for the moment I am not travelling so much on my own affairs as upon somebody else’s. General Betrishtchev, my intimate friend, and I may say my benefactor, asked me to visit his relations. Relations of course are relations, but to some extent I may say I am going on my own account, for apart from the benefit that may accrue from the point of view of the digestion, the mere fact of seeing the world and what people are doing... say what you will, is a living book, a second education.”","“To tell you the truth,” replied that personage with an affable inclination of the head as he smoothed the arm of his chair with his hand, “I am travelling less on my own affairs than on the affairs of others. That is to say, General Betristchev, an intimate friend, and, I might add, a generous benefactor, of mine, has charged me with commissions to some of his relatives. Nevertheless, though relatives are relatives, I may say that I am travelling on my own account as well, in that, in addition to possible benefit to my health, I desire to see the world and the whirligig of humanity, which constitute, so to speak, a living book, a second course of education.”","“I confess,” said Chichikov, inclining his head to one side and grasping the armrest of the chair with his hand, “I am traveling, for the moment, not so much on my own necessity as on another’s. General Betrishchev, a close friend and, one might say, benefactor, asked me to visit his relatives. Relatives are relatives, of course, but it is partly, so to speak, for my own self as well; because, indeed, to say nothing of the good that may come from it in the hemorrhoidal respect, the fact alone that one sees the world, the circulation of people … whatever they may say, it is, so to speak, a living book, the same as learning.”",

"«А мне пусть их все передерутся, — думал Хлобуев, выходя. — Афанасий Васильевич не глуп. Он дал мне это порученье, верно, обдумавши. Исполнить его — вот и все».

Ведь если бы с этакой волей и настойчивостью да на доброе дело!»","“And I’ll let them all fight,” thought Khlobuev, going out. - Afanasy Vasilyevich is not stupid.

I must carry it out, that’s all.” He began thinking about the journey while Murazov was still repeating to himself: “Most enigmatical man, Pavel Ivanovitch Tchitchikov. If only such will and perseverance were devoted to a good object!”","And even as Khlobuev spoke he felt renewed vigour and confidence arise in his soul, and his mind begin to awake to a sense of hopefulness of eventually being able to put to flight his troubles. And even as it was, the world seemed to be growing dim to his eyes.... Meanwhile, plea after plea had been presented to the legal authorities, and daily were relatives whom no one had before heard of putting in an appearance.","“They can fight it out among themselves for all of me,” Khlobuev thought on his way out. “Afanasy Vassilyevich is no fool. He must have given me this charge after thinking it over. Just let me accomplish it— that’s all.” He began thinking about the road, at the same time as Murazov was still repeating to himself: “A most mysterious man to me, this Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov!

"Чичиков стал опасаться, чтобы Хлобуев не услышал, и потому отстал еще подальше.","Chichikov began to fear that Khlobuev would not hear, and therefore fell further behind.","Tchitchikov began to be afraid that Hlobuev might overhear, and so dropped even further behind.","“You seem to get great store upon views and beauty,” remarked Kostanzhoglo with reproof in his tone.","Chichikov began to fear lest Khlobuev overhear them, and so he dropped still farther behind.",

"«Нет, этого мы приятелю и понюхать не дадим», — сказал про себя Чичиков и потом объяснил, что такого приятеля никак не найдется, что одни издержки по этому делу будут стоить более, ибо от судов нужно отрезать полы собственного кафтана да уходить подалее; но что если он уже действительно так стиснут, то, будучи подвигнут участием, он готов дать… но что это такая безделица, о которой даже не стоит и говорить.","“No, we won’t even let a friend sniff that,” Chichikov said to himself, and then explained that there was no way to find such a friend, that the costs alone in this case would cost more, because you need to cut off the skirts of your own caftan from the courts and go further away; but that if he is already really so squeezed, then, being moved by participation, he is ready to give ... but that this is such a trifle that it’s not even worth talking about.","“No, I am not going to let any friend have an inkling of it,” thought Tchitchikov to himself: and then he explained that such a friend could not be found, since the expenses of the business would cost more than that, seeing that one had better cut off the skirts of one’s coat than not get away from the courts, but if he really was so pressed for money, then he was ready out of sympathy to give ... but really it was a trifle scarcely worth discussing.","“Perhaps so, but I am not going to let any one but myself have a finger in this,” thought Chichikov to himself; after which he explained to Plushkin that a friend of the kind mentioned would be impossible to discover, since the legal expenses of the enterprise would lead to the said friend having to cut the very tail from his coat before he would get clear of the lawyers. “Nevertheless,” added Chichikov, “seeing that you are so hard pressed for money, and that I am so interested in the matter, I feel moved to advance you—well, to advance you such a trifle as would scarcely be worth mentioning.”","“No, we won’t let any friend get a whiff of this,” Chichikov said to himself, and then explained that there was no way to find such a friend, that the cost of the procedure alone would be more than it was worth, for one had better cut off the tails of one’s caftan and run as far as one can from the courts; but that if he was actually in such straits, then, being moved by compassion, he was ready to give … but it was such a trifle that it did not deserve mention.","“No, we won’t let any friend have even a sniff of this,” said Chichikov to himself and then explained that one could never find such a friend as that, inasmuch as the mere outlay involved would cost more than any serf was worth, for once you got tangled with the law and lawyers you would have to cut off the skirts of your own coat to get out of their clutches as fast and as far as possible; but if he, Pliushkin, was so hard-pressed, then he, Chichikov, being motivated by sympathy, was ready to give him ... but it was such a trifle that it was not worthwhile even talking about it."

"Таковы были обстоятельства Андрея Ивановича Тентетникова. Вдруг в один день, подходя к окну обычным порядком, с трубкой и чашкой в руках, заметил он во дворе движенье и некоторую суету. Поварчонок и поломойка бежали отворять вороты, и в воротах показались кони, точь-в-точь как лепят иль рисуют их на триумфальных воротах: морда направо, морда налево, морда посередине. Свыше их, на козлах — кучер и лакей в широком сюртуке, опоясавший себя носовым платком. За ними господин в картузе и шинели, закутанный в косынку радужных цветов. Когда экипаж изворотился перед крыльцом, оказалось, что был он не что другое, как рессорная легкая бричка. Господин необыкновенно приличной наружности соскочил на крыльцо с быстротой и ловкостью почти военного человека.","Such were the circumstances of Andrei Ivanovich Tentetnikov. Suddenly, one day, going up to the window in the usual manner, with a pipe and a cup in his hands, he noticed movement in the yard and some fuss.

Above them, on the goats - a coachman and a footman in a wide frock coat, girded with a handkerchief. Behind them is a gentleman in a cap and overcoat, wrapped in a scarf of rainbow colors. When the carriage dodged in front of the porch, it turned out that it was nothing more than a light spring britzka. A gentleman of unusually decent appearance jumped down onto the porch with the speed and agility of an almost military man.","Such were the circumstances of Andrey Ivanovitch Tyentyetnikov. Suddenly one day, on going to the window as usual with his cup of tea and his pipe, he noticed some commotion and bustle in the yard.

On the box above them were a coachman and a footman wearing a full frock-coat, girt round the waist with a pocket-handkerchief; behind them sat a gentleman in a cap and greatcoat, wrapped in a shawl of rainbow hues.

But one morning he noticed, on moving to the window after breakfast, that not a word was proceeding either from the butler or the housekeeper, but that, on the contrary, the courtyard seemed to smack of a certain bustle and excitement. This was because through the entrance gates (which the kitchen maid and the scullion had run to open) there were appearing the noses of three horses—one to the right, one in the middle, and one to the left, after the fashion of triumphal groups of statuary. Above them, on the box seat, were seated a coachman and a valet, while behind, again, there could be discerned a gentleman in a scarf and a fur cap. Only when the equipage had entered the courtyard did it stand revealed as a light spring britchka.

"— Пожалуй, я тебе дам девчонку; она у меня знает дорогу, только ты смотри! не завези ее, у меня уже одну завезли купцы.","- Perhaps I'll give you a girl; she knows the way, just you look! don’t bring her, the merchants have already brought one from me.","“Very well, I’ll let you have a little girl, she knows the way; only mind you don’t carry her off, some merchants have carried off one of mine already.”",She knows the way thoroughly. Only do not carry her off for good. Already some traders have deprived me of one of my girls.”,"“Why don’t I give you a girl then; she knows the way—only watch out! don’t carry her off, one of mine already got carried off by some merchants.”","“Yes, that’s what I’ll do, I’ll let you take a girl along—that little wench of mine knows the way. Only, look you, don’t you go and carry her off; some merchants have already carried one off from me.”"
"— Да что в самом деле… как будто точно сурьезное дело; да я в другом месте нипочем возьму. Еще мне всякий с охотой сбудет их, чтобы только поскорей избавиться. Дурак разве станет держать их при себе и платить за них подати!","- Yes, really ... as if it were a serious matter; Yes, I'll take it anywhere else. Also, everyone will gladly sell them to me, just to get rid of them as soon as possible. Would a fool keep them with him and pay taxes for them!","as though it were something real! Why, I could get them for nothing elsewhere. What’s more, any one else would be glad to let me have them simply to get rid of them. Only a fool would want to keep them and go on paying the tax on them!”","This is a serious matter. Any one but you would be thankful to get rid of the souls. Only a fool would stick to them, and continue to pay the tax.”","“What indeed is this … as if it were all quite a serious matter; I can get them for nothing elsewhere. Anyone would be eager to unload them on me, just to get rid of them the sooner. Only a fool would keep them and pay taxes on them!”","“But what is all this, really?.. . Just as if it were truly serious business! Why, I’ll get them for nothing some other place. And everybody will hand them over to me right willingly, only to get rid of them as quickly as possible.

They will say: ‘Here, this is for deceiving your master, you wicked woman,’ and they’ll toast you on hot coals!”","“Nay, devils shall roast you, sure enough. They will say to you, ‘Bad woman, we are doing this because you robbed your master,’ and then stoke up the fire still hotter.”","“Ah, but the devils will make it hot for you!

"Чичиков, чинясь, проходил в дверь боком, чтоб дать и хозяину пройти с ним вместе; но это было напрасно: хозяин бы не прошел, да его уж и не было. Слышно было только, как раздавались его речи по двору: «Да что ж Фома Большой? Зачем он до сих пор не здесь? Ротозей Емельян, беги к повару-телепню, чтобы потрошил поскорей осетра. Молоки, икру, потроха и лещей в уху, а карасей — в соус. Да раки, раки! Ротозей Фома Меньшой, где же раки? раки, говорю, раки?!» И долго раздавалися всё — раки да раки.","Chichikov, pompous, went sideways through the door to let the host go with him; but it was in vain: the owner would not have passed, but he was already gone. One could only hear how his speeches were heard around the yard: “But what about Thomas the Great? Why is he still not here? Rotozey Emelyan, run to the telecook to gut the sturgeon as soon as possible. Milk, caviar, offal and bream in the ear, and carp - in the sauce. Yes, crabs, crabs! Rotozei Foma the Lesser, where are the crayfish? crayfish, I say, crayfish ?! And for a long time everything was heard - crayfish and crayfish.","Tchitchikov from politeness went in at the door sideways so as to allow the master of the house to pass in with him; but this courtesy was thrown away, the stout gentleman could not have got through the door with him, moreover he had already disappeared, he could only hear his remarks in the yard. “Why, what’s Big Foma about? Why isn’t he here yet? Emelyan, you sluggard, run to booby the cook and tell him to make haste and stuff the sturgeon. Put the soft roe and the hard roe, the insides and the bream into the soup, and the crucians into the sauce. And the crayfish, the crayfish! Little Foma, you sluggard, where are the crayfish? The crayfish, I say the crayfish?” And for a long time afterwards he still heard shouts “Crayfish, crayfish.”","“I regret the mistake extremely,” said Chichikov. “But it is not a mistake. When you have tried the dinner which I have in store for you, just see whether you think IT a mistake. Enter, I beg of you.” And, taking Chichikov by the arm, the host conducted him within, where they were met by a couple of youths.","Chichikov decorously passed through the doors sideways, so as to allow the host to enter with him; but this was in vain: the host could not enter, and besides he was no longer there.

Milt, roe, innards, and bream—into the soup; carp—into the sauce. And crayfish, crayfish!

Каков же после этого прелестник?","“Ah, Anna Grigorievna, if only there were chickens, that would be nothing; listen only to what the archpriest told: the landowner Korobochka came to her, she says, frightened and pale as death, and she tells, and as she tells, just listen, just listen, a perfect romance: suddenly, in the dead of midnight, when everything was already asleep in the house, it is heard at the gate a knock, the most dangerous one imaginable; they shout: “Open, open, otherwise the gate will be broken down!” What will it look like to you? What then is the charmer?","“Ah, Anna Grigoryevna, if it were no worse than that, that would be nothing. Just listen to what she told me. She says that Madame Korobotchka, a lady from the country, came to her, panic-stricken and pale as death, and told her a tale, such a tale! Only listen, it’s a regular novel: all at once at dead of night when every one was asleep there came a knock at the gate more awful than anything you could imagine; there was a shout of ‘Open, open, or we’ll smash open the gate!’ ... What do you think of that? He’s a charming fellow after that, isn’t he?”","That is to say, at dead of night, just when every one had retired to rest, there came the most dreadful knocking imaginable, and some one screamed out, ‘Open the gates, or we will break them down!’ Just think!

What sort of a charmer is he, after that?”"

Put on a simple Siberian coat ... after all, you are now a simple man, a ruined nobleman and the same beggar: what is there to fix? - Yes, with a book in your hands, on a simple cart and go to towns and villages. From the bishop you will receive a blessing and a laced book, and with God.","“It is not I, Pyotr Petrovitch, sir, that lay it upon you, but since you would like to be of service as you say yourself, here is a godly work for you.

There is need for a church to be built, but no money wherewith to build it. Money must be collected to that end.’ Then he shut to the wicket. I wondered to myself what this could mean, and concluded that the recluse had been unwilling to accord me his counsel. Next I repaired to the Archimandrite, and had scarce reached his door when he inquired of me whether I could commend to him a man meet to be entrusted with the collection of alms for a church—a man who should belong to the dvoriane or to the more lettered merchants, but who would guard the trust as he would guard the salvation of his soul. On the instant thought I to myself: ‘Why should not the Holy Father appoint my friend Semen Semenovitch? For the way of suffering would benefit him greatly; and as he passed with his ledger from landowner to peasant, and from peasant to townsman, he would learn where folk dwell, and who stands in need of aught, and thus would become better acquainted with the countryside than folk who dwell in cities.","“It is not I, Pyotr Petrovich, who will impose it on you, but since you wish to serve, as you yourself say, sir, here is a God-pleasing deed for you.

Put on a simple sibirka … you see, you’re a simple man now, a ruined nobleman, the same as a beggar: why pretend? With ledger in hand, in a simple cart, go around to the towns and villages.

"Муразов поклонился и прямо от князя отправился к Чичикову. Он нашел Чичикова уже в духе, весьма покойно занимавшегося довольно порядочным обедом, который был ему принесен в фаянсовых судках из какой-то весьма порядочной кухни.

"— Такой приказ, так уж, видно, следует, — сказал швейцар и прибавил к тому слово: «да». После чего стал перед ним совершенно непринужденно, не сохраняя того ласкового вида, с каким прежде торопился снимать с него шинель. Казалось, он думал, глядя на него: «Эге! уж коли тебя бары гоняют с крыльца, так ты, видно, так себе, шушера какой-нибудь!»","“Such an order, apparently, follows,” said the porter, and added the word “yes” to it. After that, he stood in front of him completely at ease, without retaining that affectionate air with which he had previously hurried to take off his greatcoat. He seemed to think, looking at him: “Hey! if the bars are chasing you off the porch, then you, apparently, are so-so, some kind of riff-raff!”","“That’s my orders; so I suppose that’s right,” said the hall porter, and added the word, “Yes,” after which he stood facing him in the most free and easy attitude, completely dropping the ingratiating air with which on other occasions he had hastened to help him off with his coat. He seemed as he looked at him to think, “Aha, since their Excellencies kick you out of the door you must be a low rascal!”","“Those are my orders, and they must be obeyed,” said the footman, confronting Chichikov with none of that politeness with which, on former occasions, he had hastened to divest our hero of his wrappings. Evidently he was of opinion that, since the gentry declined to receive the visitor, the latter must certainly be a rogue.","“Them’s the orders, so obviously it’s proper,” said the doorkeeper, adding to it the word “Yes.” After which he stood before him totally at ease, not keeping that benign look with which he formerly used to hasten and take his overcoat from him. He seemed to be thinking, as he looked at him: “Oho! if the masters are showing you the door, then clearly you’re some kind of riffraff!”","“Them’s the orders, so it seems that’s the way things have to be,” said the doorman and added the word “Yes,” after which he took his stand before Chichikov in a free and easy manner, without bothering about that genial air with which formerly he’d hasten to help him off with his overcoat. He seemed to be thinking, as he eyed him: “Eh, now, since the masters are chasing you off their front steps, you must be just nothing at all, just some sort of common trash, I guess!”"

"Тут только, оглянувшись вокруг себя, он заметил, что они ехали прекрасною рощей; миловидная березовая ограда тянулась у них справа и слева. Между дерев мелькала белая каменная церковь. В конце улицы показался господин, шедший к ним навстречу, в картузе, с суковатой палкой в руке. Облизанный аглицкий пес на высоких ножках бежал перед ним.","Only then, looking around him, did he notice that they were driving through a beautiful grove; a pretty birch fence stretched from their right and left. A white stone church flickered between the trees. At the end of the street a gentleman appeared, walking towards them, in a cap, with a gnarled stick in his hand. A licked English dog on high legs ran in front of him.","Only then looking about him he noticed that they were driving through a beautiful copse. An enclosure of charming birch-trees stretched to left and to right. Between the trees a white brick church appeared. At the end of the road a gentleman came into sight walking towards them, wearing a cap and carrying a gnarled stick in his hand. A long-legged English hound was running ahead of him.","Presently, as Chichikov gazed about him, he saw that for some time past the koliaska had been skirting a beautiful wood, and that on either side the road was bordered with an edging of birch trees, the tenderly-green, recently-opened leaves of which caused their tall, slender trunks to show up with the whiteness of a snowdrift. Likewise nightingales were warbling from the recesses of the foliage, and some wood tulips were glowing yellow in the grass. Next (and almost before Chichikov had realised how he came to be in such a beautiful spot when, but a moment before, there had been visible only open fields) there glimmered among the trees the stony whiteness of a church, with, on the further side of it, the intermittent, foliage-buried line of a fence; while from the upper end of a village street there was advancing to meet the vehicle a gentleman with a cap on his head, a knotted cudgel in his hands, and a slender-limbed English dog by his side.","Only here, looking around him, did he notice that they were driving through a beautiful grove; a comely fence of birches stretched to right and left of them.

A sleek English hound was running on long legs in front of him.",
"На другой день Чичиков отправился на обед и вечер к полицеймейстеру, где с трех часов после обеда засели в вист и играли до двух часов ночи. Там, между прочим, он познакомился с помещиком Ноздревым, человеком лет тридцати, разбитным малым, который ему после трех-четырех слов начал говорить «ты». С полицеймейстером и прокурором Ноздрев тоже был на «ты» и обращался по-дружески; но, когда сели играть в большую игру, полицеймейстер и прокурор чрезвычайно внимательно рассматривали его взятки и следили почти за всякою картою, с которой он ходил. На другой день Чичиков провел вечер у председателя палаты, который принимал гостей своих в халате, несколько замасленном, и в том числе двух каких-то дам. Потом был на вечере у вице-губернатора, на большом обеде у откупщика, на небольшом обеде у прокурора, который, впрочем, стоил большого; на закуске после обедни, данной городским главою, которая тоже стоила обеда. Словом, ни одного часа не приходилось ему оставаться дома, и в гостиницу приезжал он с тем только, чтобы заснуть. Приезжий во всем как-то умел найтиться и показал в себе опытного светского человека. О чем бы разговор ни был, он всегда умел поддержать его: шла ли речь о лошадином заводе, он говорил и о лошадином заводе; говорили ли о хороших собаках, и здесь он сообщал очень дельные замечания; трактовали ли касательно следствия, произведенного казенною палатою, — он показал, что ему небезызвестны и судейские проделки; было ли рассуждение о бильярдной игре — и в бильярдной игре не давал он промаха; говорили ли о добродетели, и о добродетели рассуждал он очень хорошо, даже со слезами на глазах; об выделке горячего вина, и в горячем вине знал он прок; о таможенных надсмотрщиках и чиновниках, и о них он судил так, как будто бы сам был и чиновником и надсмотрщиком. Но замечательно, что он все это умел облекать какою-то степенностью, умел хорошо держать себя. Говорил ни громко, ни тихо, а совершенно так, как следует. Словом, куда ни повороти, был очень порядочный человек. Все чиновники были довольны приездом нового лица. Губернатор об нем изъяснился, что он благонамеренный человек; прокурор — что он дельный человек; жандармский полковник говорил, что он ученый человек; председатель палаты — что он знающий и почтенный человек; полицеймейстер — что он почтенный и любезный человек; жена полицеймейстера — что он любезнейший и обходительнейший человек. Даже сам Собакевич, который редко отзывался о ком-нибудь с хорошей стороны, приехавши довольно поздно из города и уже совершенно раздевшись и легши на кровать возле худощавой жены своей, сказал ей: «Я, душенька, был у губернатора на вечере, и у полицеймейстера обедал, и познакомился с коллежским советником Павлом Ивановичем Чичиковым: преприятный человек!» На что супруга отвечала: «Гм!» — и толкнула его ногою.","The next day, Chichikov went to dinner and evening to the police chief, where from three o'clock in the afternoon they sat down to whist and played until two in the morning. There, by the way, he met the landowner Nozdryov, a man of about thirty, a broken fellow, who, after three or four words, began to say “you” to him. With the police chief and the prosecutor, Nozdryov was also on ""you"" and treated in a friendly way; but when they sat down to play a big game, the police chief and the prosecutor examined his bribes with extreme attention and watched almost every card with which he walked. The next day, Chichikov spent the evening with the chairman of the chamber, who received his guests in a dressing gown, somewhat greasy, including two ladies. Then he was at a party with the vice-governor, at a big dinner at the farmer's, at a small dinner at the prosecutor's, which, however, cost a lot; on an after-mass snack given by the mayor, which was also worth dinner. In a word, he did not have to stay at home for a single hour, and he came to the hotel only to fall asleep. The visitor somehow knew how to find himself in everything and showed himself an experienced secular person. Whatever the conversation was about, he always knew how to support it: if it was about a horse farm, he talked about a horse farm; whether they talked about good dogs, and here he reported very sensible remarks; whether they interpreted with regard to the investigation carried out by the Treasury, he showed that he was not unknown to judicial tricks; whether there was a discussion about the game of billiards - and in the game of billiards he did not miss; whether they talked about virtue, and he talked about virtue very well, even with tears in his eyes; about the manufacture of hot wine, and he knew the use of hot wine; about customs overseers and officials, and he judged them as if he himself were both an official and an overseer. But it is remarkable that he knew how to clothe all this with some degree, knew how to behave well. He spoke neither loudly nor softly, but exactly as he should. In a word, wherever you turn, he was a very decent person. All the officials were pleased with the arrival of the new face. The governor said of him that he was a well-intentioned man; the prosecutor - that he is an efficient person; the gendarmerie colonel said that he was a learned man; the chairman of the chamber - that he is a knowledgeable and respectable person; police chief - that he is a respectable and amiable person; the police chief's wife - that he is the most amiable and courteous person. Even Sobakevich himself, who rarely spoke of anyone in a good way, having arrived quite late from the city and already completely undressed and lay down on the bed next to his thin wife, said to her: dined, and met the collegiate adviser Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov: a pleasant person! To which the wife replied: “Hm!” and kicked him with her foot.","Next day Tchitchikov went to dinner and to spend the evening at the police-master‘s, where after dinner they sat down to whist at three o‘clock and played till two o’clock in the morning. There he made the acquaintance, among others, of a landowner called Nozdryov, a man of thirty, a jolly good fellow who from the first three or four words began to address him familiarly. With the police-master and public prosecutor Nozdryov was on equally friendly and familiar terms; but when they sat down to play for high stakes, both the gentlemen kept an extremely careful watch on the tricks he took and noted almost every card he played. Next day Tchitchikov spent the evening with the president of the court, who received his visitors in his somewhat greasy dressing-gown, and in the company of two somewhat dubious ladies. Then he spent an evening at the deputy-governor‘s, went to a big dinner at the spirit tax contractor’s, and to a little dinner at the public prosecutor’s which was however as good as a big one; he went also to a lunch after mass, given by the mayor of the town, which was as good as a dinner,—in short he had not to spend a single hour at home and returned to the hotel only to sleep. The new-comer was quite at his ease on every occasion and showed himself an experienced man of the world. Whatever the subject of conversation he could always keep it up: were horse-breeding discussed, he talked about horse-breeding; if they conversed about the best dogs, on that subject too he made very apt observations; if they touched on a case inquired into by the court of justice, he showed that he was not ignorant of court procedure; if the topic were a game of billiards, he was not at sea in billiards either; if the conversation turned upon virtue, he made excellent reflections upon virtue and even with tears in his eyes; upon the preparation of hot punch, he was an authority on punch too; upon overseers of customs and excise officers, he discoursed about them too as though he had been himself an excise officer or overseer of the customs. But it was noteworthy that he succeeded in accompanying all this with a certain sedateness, and knew very well how to behave. He spoke neither too loud nor too low, but exactly as he ought. Take him how you would, he was a thoroughly gentlemanly man. All the government officials were pleased at the arrival of the new-comer. The governor pronounced that he was a man thoroughly to be depended upon; the public prosecutor said that he was a practical man; the colonel of the gendarmes said that he was a well-educated man; the president of the court said that he was a well-informed and estimable man; the police-master that he was an estimable and agreeable man; the police-master’s wife that he was a most agreeable and most amiable man. Though Sobakevitch rarely said anything good of any one, yet even he, after returning rather late from town, undressing and getting into bed beside his scraggy wife, said to her: “I spent the evening at the governor‘s, my love, and dined at the police-master’s and made the acquaintance of a collegiate councillor called Pavel Ivanovitch Tchitchikov, a very agreeable man!” To which his spouse responded with: “H’m,” and kicked him.","Next day Chichikov dined and spent the evening at the house of the Chief of Police—a residence where, three hours after dinner, every one sat down to whist, and remained so seated until two o’clock in the morning. On this occasion Chichikov made the acquaintance of, among others, a landowner named Nozdrev—a dissipated little fellow of thirty who had no sooner exchanged three or four words with his new acquaintance than he began to address him in the second person singular. Yet although he did the same to the Chief of Police and the Public Prosecutor, the company had no sooner seated themselves at the card-table than both the one and the other of these functionaries started to keep a careful eye upon Nozdrev’s tricks, and to watch practically every card which he played. The following evening Chichikov spent with the President of the Local Council, who received his guests—even though the latter included two ladies—in a greasy dressing-gown. Upon that followed an evening at the Vice-Governor’s, a large dinner party at the house of the Commissioner of Taxes, a smaller dinner-party at the house of the Public Prosecutor (a very wealthy man), and a subsequent reception given by the Mayor. In short, not an hour of the day did Chichikov find himself forced to spend at home, and his return to the inn became necessary only for the purposes of sleeping. Somehow or other he had landed on his feet, and everywhere he figured as an experienced man of the world. No matter what the conversation chanced to be about, he always contrived to maintain his part in the same. Did the discourse turn upon horse-breeding, upon horse-breeding he happened to be peculiarly well-qualified to speak. Did the company fall to discussing well-bred dogs, at once he had remarks of the most pertinent kind possible to offer. Did the company touch upon a prosecution which had recently been carried out by the Excise Department, instantly he showed that he too was not wholly unacquainted with legal affairs. Did an opinion chance to be expressed concerning billiards, on that subject too he was at least able to avoid committing a blunder. Did a reference occur to virtue, concerning virtue he hastened to deliver himself in a way which brought tears to every eye. Did the subject in hand happen to be the distilling of brandy—well, that was a matter concerning which he had the soundest of knowledge. Did any one happen to mention Customs officials and inspectors, from that moment he expatiated as though he too had been both a minor functionary and a major. Yet a remarkable fact was the circumstance that he always contrived to temper his omniscience with a certain readiness to give way, a certain ability so to keep a rein upon himself that never did his utterances become too loud or too soft, or transcend what was perfectly befitting. In a word, he was always a gentleman of excellent manners, and every official in the place felt pleased when he saw him enter the door. Thus the Governor gave it as his opinion that Chichikov was a man of excellent intentions; the Public Prosecutor, that he was a good man of business; the Chief of Gendarmery, that he was a man of education; the President of the Local Council, that he was a man of breeding and refinement; and the wife of the Chief of Gendarmery, that his politeness of behaviour was equalled only by his affability of bearing. Nay, even Sobakevitch—who as a rule never spoke well of ANY ONE—said to his lanky wife when, on returning late from the town, he undressed and betook himself to bed by her side: “My dear, this evening, after dining with the Chief of Police, I went on to the Governor’s, and met there, among others, a certain Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, who is a Collegiate Councillor and a very pleasant fellow.” To this his spouse replied “Hm!” and then dealt him a hearty kick in the ribs.","The next day Chichikov went to dine and spend the evening with the police chief, where they settled down to whist at three o’clock after dinner and played until two o’clock in the morning. There, incidentally, he made the acquaintance of the landowner Nozdryov, a man of about thirty, a rollicksome fellow, who after three or four words began to address him familiarly. He addressed the police chief and the prosecutor in the same way and was on friendly terms with them; yet when they sat down to play for big stakes, the police chief and the prosecutor studied each trick he took with extreme attention and watched almost every card he played. The next day Chichikov spent the evening with the head magistrate, who received his guests in his dressing gown, a slightly greasy one, and some two women among them. Then he attended a soirée at the vice-governor’s, a big dinner at the tax farmer’s, a small dinner at the prosecutor’s, which, however, was as good as a big one; a light lunch after the morning liturgy, given by the town mayor, which was also as good as a dinner. In short, he did not have to stay home for a single hour, and came back to the inn only to sleep. The newcomer was somehow never at a loss and showed himself to be an experienced man of the world. Whatever the conversation, he always knew how to keep up his end: if the talk was of horse breeding, he spoke about horse breeding; if they were speaking of fine dogs, here, too, he made very sensible observations; if the discussion touched upon an investigation conducted by the treasury—he showed that he was not uninformed about legal wiles ; if there were some argument about the game of billiards—in the game of billiards, too, he would not go amiss; if they spoke of virtue, on virtue, too, he reasoned very well, tears even came to his eyes; if on the distilling of spirits, then on the distilling of spirits he also knew his stuff; if on customs supervisors and officials, of them, too, he could judge as if he himself had been both an official and a supervisor. Remarkably, he knew how to clothe it all in some sort of decorum, he knew how to bear himself well. He spoke neither loudly nor softly, but absolutely as one ought. In short, however you turned it, he was a very respectable man. The officials were all pleased at the arrival of a new person. The governor opined of him that he was a right-minded man; the prosecutor that he was a sensible man; the colonel of the gendarmes said he was a learned man; the head magistrate that he was a knowledgeable and estimable man; the police chief that he was an estimable and amiable man; the police chief’s wife that he was a most amiable and mannerly man. Even Sobakevich himself, who rarely spoke of anyone from the good side, when he returned home rather late from town and, undressing completely, lay down in bed beside his lean-fleshed wife, said to her: “I, my dearest, was at the governor’s soirée and dined at the police chief’s, and I made the acquaintance of Collegiate Councillor Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov—a most agreeable man!” To which his spouse replied: “Hm!”—and shoved him with her leg.","The following day Chichikov set out for a dinner and an evening at the home of the Chief of Police, where, three hours after dinner, everybody sat down to whist and played until two in the morning. There, among other things, he made the acquaintance of Nozdrev, another landowner, a man of about thirty and a sprightly fellow who after an exchange of three or four words began “thou-ing” him. He was likewise on “thou-ing” terms with the Chief of Police and the Public Prosecutor and treated them as close friends, but just the same, when they sat down to play for big stakes, the Chief of Police and the Public Prosecutor scrutinized the tricks he took with the utmost attentiveness and kept an eye on almost every card he played. The evening of the day after that Chichikov passed at the home of the Chairman of the Administrative Offices, who received his friends in a dressing gown that was somewhat greasy, even though there were two ladies (let us call them that) among the guests. Subsequently Chichikov was at an evening given by the Vice-Governor, at a grand dinner at the tax-farmer’s, at a modest dinner at the Public Prosecutor’s (which, however, was as good as the grand one); at the Mayor’s after-mass cold buffet luncheon, which was likewise worth any dinner. In short, he did not have to remain at home for a single hour, and he would come back to his room only to sleep. The newcomer had a never-failing presence of mind, somehow, and showed himself to be an experienced man of the world. No matter what the conversation might be about he always knew how to keep it going: if the talk was about a stud farm, he would speak of a stud farm; if they happened to speak of thoroughbred dogs, he would impart very sound observations on that subject; if the conversation had to do with an investigation being carried on by the Treasury Department, he demonstrated that juridical quiddities were not unknown to him either; if they happened to speak of virtue, he would discourse about virtue, too, and discourse exceedingly well, so that tears actually welled up in his eyes; if the talk was of the distilling of hard spirits, he knew what was what in hard spirits also; if of customs inspectors and clerks, why, he passed judgment about them likewise, as though he himself had been both a clerk and an inspector. But it was remarkable that he was able to clothe all this with some sort of sedateness, that he was able to conduct himself well. He spoke neither too loudly nor too low, but in a manner that was just what it should be. In a word, no matter which way you looked at him, he was a very decent fellow. All the officials were pleased by the arrival of this new personage. The Governor expressed himself clearly on the subject, that he was a right-thinking man; the Public Prosecutor said that he was a man of affairs; the Colonel of Gendarmes, that he was a learned man; the Chairman of the Administrative Offices, that he was an experienced and meritorious man; the Chief of Police, that he was a meritorious and an amiable man; the wife of the Chief of Police, that he was the most amiable and the most courteous of men. Even Sobakevich himself, who rarely spoke well of anybody, after arriving rather late from town and having already completely undressed and got into bed by the side of his gaunt wife, said to her: “I was at the Governor’s evening-at-home, dear, and had supper at the Chief of Police’s, and made the acquaintance of a Collegiate Councilor by the name of Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov—a most pleasant fellow!” To which his spouse answered “Hmm!” and gave him a kick."
"— Чрезвычайно приятный, и какой умный, какой начитанный человек! Мы у него проиграли в вист вместе с прокурором и председателем палаты до самых поздних петухов; очень, очень достойный человек.","“Extremely pleasant, and what a clever, well-read man! We played whist with him, together with the prosecutor and the chairman of the chamber, until the very last cocks; very, very worthy person.","“Extremely agreeable, and what an intelligent, well-read man! We were playing whist at his house with the public prosecutor and the president of the court till cock-crow. A most worthy man, most worthy! ”","“Very agreeable indeed. And what a clever, well-read individual! With him and the Public Prosecutor and the President of the Local Council I played whist until the cocks uttered their last morning crow. He is a most excellent fellow.”","“Exceedingly agreeable, and such an intelligent, such a well-read man! I played whist at his place with the prosecutor and the head magistrate till the last cockcrow—a very, very worthy man.”","“Extremely pleasant, and what an intelligent, what a well-read man! We played whist at his place together with the Public Prosecutor and the Chairman of the Administrative Offices until the last roosters stopped crowing. A most worthy person, most worthy!”"
"Чичиков заметил, что это, точно, случается и что натуре находится много вещей, неизъяснимых даже для обширного ума.","Chichikov noticed that this certainly happened, and that there were many things in nature that were inexplicable even to an extensive mind.",Tchitchikov observed that it did happen like that and that there were many things in nature that could not be explained even by the profoundest intellect. “But allow me first to ask one question . . .,"Chichikov replied that such cases were common, since nature comprised many things which even the finest intellect could not compass.","Chichikov observed that that did indeed happen, and that there were many things in nature which were inexplicable even for a vast mind.","Chichikov observed that things like that did happen, most certainly, and that there were many things to be found in nature which were inexplicable for even the broadest mind."
"— Будет и невеста, как не быть, все будет, все, что хотите!..","- There will be a bride, how not to be, everything will be, everything you want! ..","“There shall be, there shall be!

How else? There will be everything, everything you wish!”"
"— А вот мы скуку сейчас прогоним, — сказал хозяин. — Бежи, Алексаша, проворней на кухню и скажи повару, чтобы поскорей прислал нам расстегайчиков. Да где ж ротозей Емельян и вор Антошка? Зачем не дают закуски?","“But we will drive away boredom now,” said the owner. “Run, Aleksasha, hurry to the kitchen and tell the cook to send us pies as soon as possible.” But where are the mouthpiece Emelyan and the thief Antoshka? Why don't they give snacks?","“Well, we’ll drive away his boredom directly,” said their host. “Run quickly to the kitchen, Alexasha, and tell the cook to send in the fish pies as soon as she can. But where’s that sluggard Emelyan and that thief Antoshka? Why don’t they bring the savouries?”","“Well, we will soon put weariness to flight,” interrupted the host. “Aleksasha, do you run helter-skelter to the kitchen, and there tell the cook to serve the fish pasties. Yes, and where have that gawk of an Emelian and that thief of an Antoshka got to? Why have they not handed round the zakuski?”","“But now we’re going to drive boredom away,” said the host. “Run to the kitchen, Alexasha, tell the cook to hurry up and send us some fish tarts. Where’s that gawk Emelyan and the thief Antoshka? Why don’t they serve the hors d’oeuvres?”",
"— Папа, что с тобой случилось?","""Daddy, what happened to you?""","“Papa, what has happened to you?”","“Oh, that uncle!” bellowed the General in paroxysms of mirth.","“Papa, what’s happened to you?”",

"— Да так просто. Или, пожалуй, продайте. Я вам за них дам деньги.","- Yes, it's that simple. Or maybe sell it. I will give you money for them.","“Oh, quite simply.

I’ll give you money for them.”","“Why, just so. Or, if you like, sell them to me. I’ll give you hard cash for them.”"

"— Смотрите же, Павел Иванович, от слова не отступитесь, — сказал Муразов, держа его руку.","""Look, Pavel Ivanovich, don't go back on your word,"" said Murazov, holding his hand.","“Mind, Pavel Ivanovitch, there is no going back from your word,” said Murazov, holding his hand.",groaned Chichikov in a voice which made Murazov’s heart bleed.,"“Watch out now, Pavel Ivanovich, don’t go back on your word,” Murazov said, holding his hand.",
"— Спасите только, Афанасий Васильевич! — вскричал он, — поведу другую жизнь, последую вашему совету!

I give you my word.”","And as these feelings came back to the penitent a groan burst from his lips, and, covering his face with his hands, he moaned: “It is all true, it is all true!” “Of little avail are knowledge of the world and experience of men unless based upon a secure foundation,” observed Murazov. “Though you have fallen, Paul Ivanovitch, awake to better things, for as yet there is time.” “No, no!”","“Only save me, Afanasy Vassilyevich,” he cried out. “I’ll lead a different life, I’ll follow your advice! Here’s my word on it!”",
"— Послушайте, любезные, — сказал он, — я очень хорошо знаю, что все дела по крепостям, в какую бы ни было цену, находятся в одном месте, а потому прошу вас показать нам стол, а если вы не знаете, что у вас делается, так мы спросим у других.","“Listen, my dears,” he said, “I know very well that all the affairs of the fortresses, no matter the price, are in one place, and therefore I ask you to show us the table, and if you don’t know what you have is done, so we ask others.","“Look here, gentlemen,” he said, “I know perfectly well that all business relating to the purchase of serfs, irrespective of the price paid, is transacted in the same office, and so I beg you to point out which is the table, and, if you don’t know what is done in your office, we will ask some one else.”","“Look here, young sirs,” he said. “I know for a fact that all serf business, no matter to what value, is transacted at one desk alone.

I'm not going to take hymen off God knows what. In a bow is another matter. Let's drop the waist!",“I don’t want to sell them: that wouldn’t be acting like a friend. I am not going to make filthy lucre from the devil knows what. Playing for it is a different matter.
