"— А обо мне что говорить? — сказал Пьер, распуская свой рот в беззаботную, веселую улыбку. — Что я такое? Je suis un batard [Я незаконный сын!] — И он вдруг багрово покраснел. Видно было, что он сделал большое усилие, чтобы сказать это. — Sans nom, sans fortune… [Без имени, без состояния…] И что ж, право… — Но он не сказал, что право. — Я cвободен пока, и мне хорошо. Я только никак не знаю, что мне начать. Я хотел серьезно посоветоваться с вами.","- And what to say about me? said Pierre, spreading his mouth into a carefree, cheerful smile. — What am I?

Only I haven’t the least idea what I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.’"

"— Вот что, мой милый, я думал о вас, — сказал князь Андрей, когда они прошли в большую залу с клавикордами. — К главнокомандующему вам ходить нечего, — говорил князь Андрей, — он наговорит вам кучу любезностей, скажет, чтобы приходили к нему обедать («это было бы еще не так плохо для службы по той субординации», подумал Борис), но из этого дальше ничего не выйдет; нас, адъютантов и ординарцев, скоро будет батальон. Но вот что мы сделаем: у меня есть хороший приятель, генерал-адъютант и прекрасный человек, князь Долгоруков; и хотя вы этого можете не знать, но дело в том, что теперь Кутузов с его штабом и мы все ровно ничего не значим: всё теперь сосредоточивается у государя; так вот мы пойдемте-ка к Долгорукову, мне и надо сходить к нему, я уж ему говорил про вас; так мы и посмотрим; не найдет ли он возможным пристроить вас при себе, или где-нибудь там, поближе к солнцу.","“That’s what, my dear, I was thinking about you,” said Prince Andrei, when they passed into a large hall with clavichords. “There’s nothing for you to go to the commander-in-chief,” said Prince Andrei, “he will tell you a bunch of pleasantries, tell you to come to dinner with him (“it wouldn’t be so bad for service in that subordination,” Boris thought), but from this further nothing will come of it; we, adjutants and orderlies, will soon have a battalion. But this is what we will do: I have a good friend, an adjutant general and a wonderful person, Prince Dolgorukov; and although you may not know this, the fact is that now Kutuzov with his headquarters and we all mean absolutely nothing: everything is now concentrated at the sovereign; so let's go to Dolgorukov, I should go to him, I already told him about you; so we'll see; whether he finds it possible to attach you with him, or somewhere there, closer to the sun.","“You see, my friend, I've been thinking about you,” said Prince Andrei, when they came to the big room with the pianoforte. “There's no point in your going to the commander in chief,” said Prince Andrei. “He'll tell you a heap of nice things, ask you to dinner” (“That wouldn't be so bad for service by the other subordination,” thought Boris), “but nothing further will come of it. There will soon be a battalion of us adjutants and orderly officers. But here's what we'll do: I have a good friend, an adjutant general and a wonderful man, Prince Dolgorukov; and though you couldn't know this, the thing is that Kutu-zov and his staff and all of us mean precisely nothing: everything is now concentrated on the sovereign. So let's go to Dolgorukov , I have to go to him anyway, and I've already spoken to him about you; so we'll see whether he can't find it possible to set you up with him or somewhere else closer to the sun.”","‘You see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you,’ said Prince Andrei when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was. ‘It’s no use your going to the commander-in-chief. He would say a lot of pleasant things, ask you to dinner’ (‘that would not be bad as regards the unwritten code,’ thought Boris), ‘but nothing more would come of it. There will soon be a battalion of us aides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is what we’ll do: I have a good friend, an adjutant-general and an excellent fellow, Prince Dolgorukov; and though you may not know it, the fact is that now Kutuzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing. Everything is now centred round the Emperor. So we will go to Dolgorukov; I have to go there anyhow, and I have already spoken to him about you. We shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you somewhere nearer the sun.’"

"Пьер был в таком состоянии неясности мысли, что при слове «удар» ему представился удар какого-нибудь тела. Он, недоумевая, посмотрел на князя Василия и уже потом сообразил, что ударом называется болезнь. Князь Василий на ходу сказал несколько слов Лоррену и прошел в дверь на цыпочках. Он не умел ходить на цыпочках и неловко подпрыгивал всем телом. Вслед за ним прошла старшая княжна, потом прошли духовные лица и причетники, люди (прислуга) тоже прошли в дверь. За этою дверью послышалось передвиженье, и наконец, всё с тем же бледным, но твердым в исполнении долга лицом, выбежала Анна Михайловна и, дотронувшись до руки Пьера, сказала:","Pierre was in such a state of vagueness of thought that at the word ""blow"" he imagined a blow from some body. He, perplexed, looked at Prince Vasily and only then realized that the disease was called a blow. Prince Vasily said a few words to Lorrain as he walked, and went through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk on tiptoe and jumped awkwardly with his whole body. The eldest princess followed him, then the clergy and clerks passed, the people (servants) also went through the door. Movement was heard behind this door, and finally, still with the same pale, but firm face in the performance of duty, Anna Mikhailovna ran out and, touching Pierre's hand, said:","Pierre was in such a state of mental confusion that, at the word “stroke,” he pictured some sort of blow to the body. He looked at Prince Vassily in perplexity, and only then realized that “stroke” referred to an illness. Prince Vassily spoke several words to Lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe. He did not know how to walk on tiptoe, and his whole body bobbed up and down awkwardly. The elder princess went in after him, then the clerical persons and the acolytes went in, then the servants also went through the door.

He looked at Prince Vasili in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness. Prince Vasili said something to Lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door.

"Граф расхохотался. Другие гости, видя, что Шиншин ведет разговор, подошли послушать. Берг, не замечая ни насмешки, ни равнодушия, продолжал рассказывать о том, как переводом в гвардию он уже выиграл чин перед своими товарищами по корпусу, как в военное время ротного командира могут убить, и он, оставшись старшим в роте, может очень легко быть ротным, и как в полку все любят его, и как его папенька им доволен.

"Болконский воспользовался этим временем, чтобы зайти к Долгорукову узнать о подробностях дела. Князь Андрей чувствовал, что Кутузов чем-то расстроен и недоволен, и что им недовольны в главной квартире, и что все лица императорской главной квартиры имеют с ним тон людей, знающих что-то такое, чего другие не знают; и поэтому ему хотелось поговорить с Долгоруковым.","Bolkonsky took advantage of this time to go to Dolgorukov to find out about the details of the case.

"На заре 16 числа эскадрон Денисова, в котором служил Николай Ростов, и который был в отряде князя Багратиона, двинулся с ночлега в дело, как говорили, и, пройдя около версты позади других колонн, был остановлен на большой дороге. Ростов видел, как мимо его прошли вперед казаки, 1-й и 2-й эскадрон гусар, пехотные батальоны с артиллерией и проехали генералы Багратион и Долгоруков с адъютантами. Весь страх, который он, как и прежде, испытывал перед делом; вся внутренняя борьба, посредством которой он преодолевал этот страх; все его мечтания о том, как он по-гусарски отличится в этом деле, — пропали даром. Эскадрон их был оставлен в резерве, и Николай Ростов скучно и тоскливо провел этот день. В 9-м часу утра он услыхал пальбу впереди себя, крики ура, видел привозимых назад раненых (их было немного) и, наконец, видел, как в середине сотни казаков провели целый отряд французских кавалеристов. Очевидно, дело было кончено, и дело было, очевидно небольшое, но счастливое. Проходившие назад солдаты и офицеры рассказывали о блестящей победе, о занятии города Вишау и взятии в плен целого французского эскадрона. День был ясный, солнечный, после сильного ночного заморозка, и веселый блеск осеннего дня совпадал с известием о победе, которое передавали не только рассказы участвовавших в нем, но и радостное выражение лиц солдат, офицеров, генералов и адъютантов, ехавших туда и оттуда мимо Ростова. Тем больнее щемило сердце Николая, напрасно перестрадавшего весь страх, предшествующий сражению, и пробывшего этот веселый день в бездействии.","At dawn on the 16th, Denisov's squadron, in which Nikolai Rostov served, and who was in the detachment of Prince Bagration, moved from overnight to work, as they said, and, having passed about a verst behind other columns, was stopped on the main road. Rostov saw how the Cossacks, the 1st and 2nd squadrons of hussars, infantry battalions with artillery passed by him, and generals Bagration and Dolgorukov with adjutants passed by. All the fear that he, as before, experienced before the deed; all the internal struggle through which he overcame this fear; all his dreams of how he would excel in this business like a hussar were in vain. Their squadron was left in reserve, and Nikolai Rostov spent that day bored and dreary. At 9 o'clock in the morning he heard firing in front of him, shouts of cheers, saw the wounded brought back (there were few of them) and, finally, saw how in the middle of hundreds of Cossacks they led a whole detachment of French cavalrymen. Obviously, the matter was over, and the matter was apparently small, but happy. Soldiers and officers passing back spoke of a brilliant victory, about the occupation of the city of Vishau and the capture of an entire French squadron. The day was clear, sunny, after a strong night frost, and the merry brilliance of the autumn day coincided with the news of the victory, which was conveyed not only by the stories of those who participated in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers, officers, generals and adjutants who were traveling back and forth past Rostov . All the more painful was the heart of Nikolai, who in vain had suffered all the fear that preceded the battle, and spent this cheerful day in inaction.","At dawn on the sixteenth, Denisov's squadron, in which Nikolai Rostov served and which was in Bagration's detachment, moved from its night lodgings into action, as they said, and having gone about half a mile behind other columns, halted on the high road. Rostov saw the Cossacks go past him, the first and second squadrons of hussars, the infantry battalions with the artillery, and then generals Bagration and Dolgorukov rode past with their adjutants. All the fear which, as previously, he experienced before action, all the inner struggle by means of which he overcame that fear, all his dreams of how he would distinguish himself as a fine hussar in this action—went for naught. Their squadron was kept in reserve, and Nikolai Rostov spent that day feeling bored and melancholy. Between eight and nine in the morning, he heard gunfire ahead of him, shouts of “Hurrah,” saw some wounded brought back (they were not many), and finally saw a whole detachment of French cavalry led along in the midst of a Cossack hundred. Obviously the action was over, and the action had obviously been not big, but successful. The soldiers and officers coming back told of a brilliant victory, of the taking of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French squadron. The day was clear, sunny, after a heavy night frost, and the cheerful brightness of the fall day coincided with the news of the victory, which was reported not only by those who took part in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of the soldiers, officers, generals, and adjutants who went there and came back past Rostov. The more wrung was Rostov's heart, who had uselessly suffered all the fear that precedes a battle, and had spent this cheerful day in inaction.","AT dawn on the 16th of November Denisov’s squadron, in which Nikolai Rostov served and which was in Prince Bagration’s detachment, moved from the place where it had spent the night, advancing into action as arranged, and after going behind other columns for about a verst, was stopped on the high road. Rostov saw the Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars, and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward, and then Generals Bagration and Dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants. All the fear before action which he had experienced as previously, all the inner struggle to conquer that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle, had been wasted. Their squadron remained in reserve and Nikolai Rostov spent that day in a dull and wretched mood. At nine in the morning he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah, and saw wounded being brought back (there were not many of them), and at last he saw how a whole detachment of French cavalry was brought in, convoyed by a sotnya* of Cossacks. Evidently the affair was over, and though not big, had been a successful engagement. The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory, of the occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French squadron. The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost, and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers, officers, generals, and adjutants, as they passed Rostov going or coming. And Nikolai, who had vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity, was all the more depressed."

"28-го октября Кутузов с армией перешел на левый берег Дуная и в первый раз остановился, положив Дунай между собой и главными силами французов. 30-го он атаковал находившуюся на левом берегу Дуная дивизию Мортье и разбил ее. В этом деле в первый раз взяты трофеи: знамя, орудия и два неприятельские генерала. В первый раз после двухнедельного отступления русские войска остановились и после борьбы не только удержали поле сражения, но прогнали французов. Несмотря на то, что войска были раздеты, изнурены, на одну треть ослаблены отсталыми, ранеными, убитыми и больными; несмотря на то, что на той стороне Дуная были оставлены больные и раненые с письмом Кутузова, поручавшим их человеколюбию неприятеля; несмотря на то, что большие госпитали и дома в Кремсе, обращенные в лазареты, не могли уже вмещать в себе всех больных и раненых, — несмотря на всё это, остановка при Кремсе и победа над Мортье значительно подняли дух войска. Во всей армии и в главной квартире ходили самые радостные, хотя и несправедливые слухи о мнимом приближении колонн из России, о какой-то победе, одержанной австрийцами, и об отступлении испуганного Бонапарта.","On October 28, Kutuzov with the army crossed to the left bank of the Danube and stopped for the first time, putting the Danube between himself and the main French forces. On the 30th, he attacked Mortier's division on the left bank of the Danube and defeated it. In this case, trophies were taken for the first time: a banner, guns and two enemy generals. For the first time after a two-week retreat, the Russian troops stopped and, after a struggle, not only held the battlefield, but drove the French away. Despite the fact that the troops were undressed, exhausted, one-third weakened backward, wounded, killed and sick; despite the fact that on the other side of the Danube the sick and wounded were left with a letter from Kutuzov entrusting them to the philanthropy of the enemy; despite the fact that the large hospitals and houses in Krems, converted into infirmaries, could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded, despite all this, the stop at Krems and the victory over Mortier significantly raised the morale of the troops. Throughout the army and in the headquarters, the most joyful, though unfair, rumors were circulating about the imaginary approach of columns from Russia, about some kind of victory won by the Austrians, and about the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.","On the twenty-eighth of October, Kutuzov crossed with his army to the left bank of the Danube and halted for the first time, having put the Danube between himself and the main forces of the French. On the thirtieth he attacked Mortier's division, which was on the left bank of the Danube, and crushed it. In this action trophies were taken for the first time: a banner, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time, after a two-week retreat, the Russian troops halted and after the fighting not only held the field of battle but drove the French away. Despite the fact that the troops were ill-clad, worn-out, weakened by a third with the Stragglers, the wounded, the dead, and the sick; despite the fact that the sick and the wounded had been left on the other side of the Danube with a letter from Kutuzov entrusting them to the humaneness of the enemy; despite the fact that the big hospitals and the houses in Krems that had been turned into infirmaries could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded—despite all that, the halt at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of the troops significantly. Throughout the army and in headquarters joyful, though incorrect, rumors were rife about the imaginary approach of columns from Russia, about some victory won by the Austrians, and about the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.","On the 28th of October Kutuzov with his army crossed to the left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time with the river between himself and the main body of the French. On the 30th he attacked Mortier’s division which was on the left bank, and broke it up. In this action for the first time trophies were taken: banners, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time, after a fortnight’s retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the French. Though the troops were ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of their number in killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter in which Kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy; and though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded, yet the stand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably. Throughout the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumours were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians, and of the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte."

"— Раны не здесь, а вот где! — сказал Кутузов, прижимая платок к раненой щеке и указывая на бегущих. — Остановите их! — крикнул он и в то же время, вероятно убедясь, что невозможно было их остановить, ударил лошадь и поехал вправо.","- The wounds are not here, but where! said Kutuzov, pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fugitives. - Stop them! he shouted, and at the same time, probably convinced that it was impossible to stop them, he hit his horse and rode to the right.","“The wound isn't here, it's there!” said Kutuzov, pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing men. “Stop them!” he cried, and at the same time, probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.","‘The wound is not here, it is there!’ said Kutuzov, pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers. ‘Stop them!’ he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right."

"Общество после чаю перешло в диванную, и княжну попросили поиграть на клавикордах. Анатоль облокотился перед ней подле m-lle Bourienne, и глаза его, смеясь и радуясь, смотрели на княжну Марью. Княжна Марья с мучительным и радостным волнением чувствовала на себе его взгляд. Любимая соната переносила ее в самый задушевно-поэтический мир, а чувствуемый на себе взгляд придавал этому миру еще большую поэтичность.

"Вечер Анны Павловны был такой же, как и первый, только новинкой, которою угощала Анна Павловна своих гостей, был теперь не Мортемар, а дипломат, приехавший из Берлина и привезший самые свежие подробности о пребывании государя Александра в Потсдаме и о том, как два высочайшие друга поклялись там в неразрывном союзе отстаивать правое дело против врага человеческого рода. Пьер был принят Анной Павловной с оттенком грусти, относившейся, очевидно, к свежей потере, постигшей молодого человека, к смерти графа Безухого (все постоянно считали долгом уверять Пьера, что он очень огорчен кончиною отца, которого он почти не знал), — и грусти точно такой же, как и та высочайшая грусть, которая выражалась при упоминаниях об августейшей императрице Марии Феодоровне. Пьер почувствовал себя польщенным этим. Анна Павловна с своим обычным искусством устроила кружки своей гостиной. Большой кружок, где были князь Василий и генералы, пользовался дипломатом. Другой кружок был у чайного столика. Пьер хотел присоединиться к первому, но Анна Павловна, находившаяся в раздраженном состоянии полководца на поле битвы, когда приходят тысячи новых блестящих мыслей, которые едва успеваешь приводить в исполнение, Анна Павловна, увидев Пьера, тронула его пальцем за рукав.","Anna Pavlovna's evening was the same as the first, only the novelty that Anna Pavlovna treated her guests was now not Mortemar, but a diplomat who had arrived from Berlin and brought the latest details about the stay of Emperor Alexander in Potsdam and how the two highest friend swore there in an inseparable alliance to defend a just cause against the enemy of the human race. Pierre was received by Anna Pavlovna with a touch of sadness, obviously related to the fresh loss that befell the young man, to the death of Count Bezukhy (everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was very upset by the death of his father, whom he hardly knew) - and sadness exactly the same as that highest sadness that was expressed at the mention of the august Empress Maria Feodorovna. Pierre felt flattered by this. Anna Pavlovna, with her usual art, arranged circles in her drawing room. The large circle, where Prince Vasily and the generals were, used a diplomat. The other circle was at the tea table. Pierre wanted to join the first, but Anna Pavlovna, who was in an irritated state of a commander on the battlefield, when thousands of new brilliant thoughts come that you barely have time to put into practice, Anna Pavlovna, seeing Pierre, touched him on the sleeve.","The soirée at Anna Pavlovna's was the same as the first, only the novelty that Anna Pavlovna was now treating her guests to was not Mortemart, but a diplomat who had come from Berlin and brought the freshest details about the emperor Alexander's visit to Potsdam and the two august friends swearing an indissoluble union in defending the right cause against the enemy of the human race.[74] Pierre was received by Anna Pavlovna with a tinge of sorrow which obviously referred to the fresh loss that had befallen the young man, the death of Count Bezukhov (everyone constantly considered it their duty to convince Pierre that he was very grieved by the death of a father he had hardly known)— and the sorrow was of the same sort as that supreme sorrow which was expressed at the mention of the august empress Maria Feodorovna. Pierre felt flattered by it. Anna Pavlovna arranged the circles in her drawing room with her usual artfulness. The large circle where Prince Vassily and the generals were had use of the diplomat. Another circle was formed by the tea table.

Anna Pavlovna received Pierre with a shade of melancholy, evidently relating to the young man’s recent loss by the death of Count Bezukhov (everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known), and her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august Majesty the Empress Marya Fyodorovna. Pierre felt flattered by this. Anna Pavlovna arranged the different groups in her drawing-room with her habitual skill. The large group, in which were Prince Vasili and the generals, had the benefit of the diplomat. Another group was at the tea table. Pierre wished to join the former, but Anna Pavlovna—who was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in action—seeing Pierre touched his sleeve with her finger, saying:"

"— Да, в каких грустных обстоятельствах пришлось нам видеться, князь… Ну, что наш дорогой больной? — сказала она, как будто не замечая холодного, оскорбительного, устремленного на нее взгляда.","- Yes, in what sad circumstances we had to see each other, prince ...

"Когда княжна Марья взошла в комнату, князь Василий с сыном уже были в гостиной, разговаривая с маленькой княгиней и m-lle Bourienne. Когда она вошла своей тяжелой походкой, ступая на пятки, мужчины и m-lle Bourienne приподнялись, и маленькая княгиня, указывая на нее мужчинам, сказала: Voila Marie! [Вот Мари!] Княжна Марья видела всех и подробно видела. Она видела лицо князя Василья, на мгновенье серьезно остановившееся при виде княжны и тотчас же улыбнувшееся, и лицо маленькой княгини, читавшей с любопытством на лицах гостей впечатление, которое произведет на них Marie. Она видела и m-lle Bourienne с ее лентой и красивым лицом и оживленным, как никогда, взглядом, устремленным на него; но она не могла видеть его, она видела только что-то большое, яркое и прекрасное, подвинувшееся к ней, когда она вошла в комнату. Сначала к ней подошел князь Василий, и она поцеловала плешивую голову, наклонившуюся над ее рукою, и отвечала на его слова, что она, напротив, очень хорошо помнит его. Потом к ней подошел Анатоль. Она всё еще не видала его. Она только почувствовала нежную руку, твердо взявшую ее, и чуть дотронулась до белого лба, над которым были припомажены прекрасные русые волосы. Когда она взглянула на него, красота его поразила ее. Анатоль, заложив большой палец правой руки за застегнутую пуговицу мундира, с выгнутой вперед грудью, а назад — спиною, покачивая одной отставленной ногой и слегка склонив голову, молча, весело глядел на княжну, видимо совершенно о ней не думая. Анатоль был не находчив, не быстр и не красноречив в разговорах, но у него зато была драгоценная для света способность спокойствия и ничем не изменяемая уверенность. Замолчи при первом знакомстве несамоуверенный человек и выкажи сознание неприличности этого молчания и желание найти что-нибудь, и будет нехорошо; но Анатоль молчал, покачивал ногой, весело наблюдая прическу княжны. Видно было, что он так спокойно мог молчать очень долго. «Ежели кому неловко это молчание, так разговаривайте, а мне не хочется», как будто говорил его вид. Кроме того в обращении с женщинами у Анатоля была та манера, которая более всего внушает в женщинах любопытство, страх и даже любовь, — манера презрительного сознания своего превосходства. Как будто он говорил им своим видом: «Знаю вас, знаю, да что с вами возиться? А уж вы бы рады!» Может быть, что он этого не думал, встречаясь с женщинами (и даже вероятно, что нет, потому что он вообще мало думал), но такой у него был вид и такая манера. Княжна почувствовала это и, как будто желая ему показать, что она и не смеет думать об том, чтобы занять его, обратилась к старому князю. Разговор шел общий и оживленный, благодаря голоску и губке с усиками, поднимавшейся над белыми зубами маленькой княгини. Она встретила князя Василья с тем приемом шуточки, который часто употребляется болтливо-веселыми людьми и который состоит в том, что между человеком, с которым так обращаются, и собой предполагают какие-то давно установившиеся шуточки и веселые, отчасти не всем известные, забавные воспоминания, тогда как никаких таких воспоминаний нет, как их и не было между маленькой княгиней и князем Васильем. Князь Василий охотно поддался этому тону; маленькая княгиня вовлекла в это воспоминание никогда не бывших смешных происшествий и Анатоля, которого она почти не знала. M-lle Bourienne тоже разделяла эти общие воспоминания, и даже княжна Марья с удовольствием почувствовала и себя втянутою в это веселое воспоминание.","When Princess Mary entered the room, Prince Vasily and his son were already in the living room, talking with the little princess and m lle Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy gait, stepping on her heels, the men and m lle Bourienne rose, and the little princess, pointing at her to the men, said: Voila Marie! [Here is Marie!] Princess Marya saw everyone and saw them in detail. She saw the face of Prince Vasily, which for a moment seriously stopped at the sight of the princess and immediately smiled, and the face of the little princess, who read with curiosity on the faces of the guests the impression that Marie would make on them. She also saw Mlle Bourienne, with her ribbon and her beautiful face, and her eyes fixed on him as lively as ever; but she could not see him, she only saw something big, bright and beautiful move towards her when she entered the room. First, Prince Vasily approached her, and she kissed the bald head, which bent over her hand, and answered his words that, on the contrary, she remembers him very well. Then Anatole approached her. She still hasn't seen him. She only felt a gentle hand, firmly taking her, and lightly touched her white forehead, over which beautiful blond hair was pomaded. When she looked at him, his beauty struck her. Anatole, placing the thumb of his right hand behind the buttoned button of his uniform, with his chest arched forward, and back with his back, swaying one leg aside and slightly bowing his head, silently, cheerfully looked at the princess, apparently not thinking about her at all. Anatole was not resourceful, not quick and not eloquent in conversations, but he had, on the other hand, the ability of calmness, precious to the world, and unalterable confidence. Shut up at the first meeting, a not self-confident person and show the consciousness of the indecency of this silence and the desire to find something, and it will not be good; but Anatole was silent, shaking his leg, cheerfully observing the princess's hairdo. It was evident that he could be so calmly silent for a very long time. “If anyone is uncomfortable with this silence, then talk, but I don’t feel like it,” his appearance seemed to say. In addition, in dealing with women, Anatole had that manner that most of all inspires curiosity, fear and even love in women - a manner of contemptuous consciousness of his superiority. It was as if he was telling them with his appearance: “I know you, I know, but why bother with you? And you would be glad!” It may be that he did not think this when he met women (and it is even probable that he did not, because he did not think much at all), but such was his appearance and such manner. The princess felt this and, as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare to think of occupying him, she turned to the old prince. The conversation was general and lively, thanks to the voice and the sponge with the mustache, rising above the white teeth of the little princess. She met Prince Vasily with that trick of a joke, which is often used by talkatively cheerful people and which consists in the fact that between the person who is treated this way and herself, some long-established jokes and funny, partly not known to everyone, amusing memories are suggested. , while there are no such memories, as there were none between the little princess and Prince Vasily. Prince Vasily willingly succumbed to this tone; the little princess drew into this recollection of never-before funny incidents and Anatole, whom she hardly knew. Mlle Bourienne also shared these common memories, and even Princess Mary felt with pleasure that she was also drawn into this cheerful memory.","When Princess Marya came in, Prince Vassily and his son were already in the drawing room, talking with the little princess and Mlle Bourienne. When she came in with her heavy step, planting her heels, the men and Mlle Bourienne rose, and the little princess, pointing to her, said, “Voilà Marie!” Princess Marya saw them all, and saw them in detail. She saw the face of Prince Vassily, momentarily freezing in a serious expression at the sight of the princess, and the face of the little princess, curiously reading on the faces of the guests the impression Marie made. She also saw Mlle Bourienne with her ribbon, and her beautiful face, and her gaze—lively as never before—directed at him; but she could not see him, she saw only something big, bright, and beautiful, which moved towards her as she came into the room. Prince Vassily went up to her first, and she kissed the bald head that bowed over her hand, and to his words replied that, on the contrary, she remembered him very well. Then Anatole came up to her. She still did not see him. She only felt a gentle hand firmly take hold of her hand, and barely touched the white forehead with beautiful, pomaded blond hair above it. When she looked at him, his beauty struck her. Anatole, the thumb of his right hand placed behind a fastened button of his uniform, chest thrust out, shoulders back, swinging his free leg slightly, and inclining his head a little, gazed silently and cheerfully at the princess, obviously without thinking of her at all. Anatole was not resourceful, not quick and eloquent in conversation, but he had instead a capacity, precious in society, for composure and unalterable assurance. When an insecure man is silent at first acquaintance and shows an awareness of the impropriety of this silence and a wish to find something to say, it comes out badly; but Anatole was silent, swung his leg, and cheerfully observed the princess's hairstyle. It was clear that he could calmly remain silent like that for a very long time. “If anyone feels awkward because of this silence, speak up, but I don't care to,” his look seemed to say. Besides that, in Anatole's behavior with women there was a manner which more than any other awakens women's curiosity, fear, and even love—a manner of contemptuous awareness of his own superiority. As if he were saying to them with his look: “I know you, I know, but why should I bother with you? And you'd be glad if I did!” Perhaps he did not think that when he met women (and it is even probable that he did not, because he generally thought little), but such was his look and manner. The princess felt it, and, as if wishing to show him that she dared not even think of interesting him, turned to the old prince. The conversation was general and lively, thanks to the little princess's voice and the lip with its little mustache which kept rising up over her white teeth. She met Prince Vassily in that jocular mode often made use of by garrulously merry people, which consists in the fact that, between the person thus addressed and oneself, there are supposed to exist some long-established jokes and merry, amusing reminiscences, not known to everyone, when in fact there are no such reminiscences, as there were none between the little princess and Prince Vassily. Prince Vassily readily yielded to this tone; the little princess also involved Anatole, whom she barely knew, in this reminiscence of never-existing funny incidents. Mlle Bourienne also shared in these common reminiscences, and even Princess Marya enjoyed feeling herself drawn into this merry reminiscence.","WHEN Princess Marya came down, Prince Vasili and his son were already in the drawing-room talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels, the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess, indicating her to the gentlemen, said: ‘Voilà Marie!’ Princess Marya saw them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince Vasili’s face, serious for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling again, and the little princess curiously noting the impression ‘Marie’ produced on the visitors. And she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne with her ribbon and pretty face and her face animated as never before, with her gaze fixed on him, but him she could not see, she only saw something large, brilliant, and handsome moving towards her as she entered the room. Prince Vasili approached first, and she kissed the bald forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well. Then Anatole came up to her. She still could not see him. She only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her lips a white forehead over which waved beautiful lightbrown hair anointed with pomade. When she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty. Anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his uniform, his chest expanded and his back drawn in, slightly swinging one foot and, with his head a little bent, looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all. Anatole was not quick-witted, not ready or eloquent in conversation, but he had the faculty, so invaluable in society, of composure and imperturbable self-possession. If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the princess’s hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time. ‘If anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let him talk, but I don’t want to,’ he seemed to say. Besides this, in his behaviour to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspired in them curiosity, awe, and even love—a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority. It was as if he said to them: ‘I know you, I know you, but why should I bother about you? You’d be only too glad, of course.’ Perhaps he did not really think this when he met women—even probably he did not, for in general he thought very little—but his looks and manner gave that impression. The princess felt this, and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him, she turned to his father. The conversation was general and animated, thanks to the little princess’s small voice and little downy lip that lifted over the white teeth. She met Prince Vasili with that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people, and consisting in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves there are some semi-private long-established jokes and amusing reminiscences, though no such reminiscences really exist—just as none existed in this case. Prince Vasili readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred. Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them and even Princess Marya felt herself pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences."

"Отдав еще и еще разные приказания, он вышел было отдохнуть к графинюшке, но вспомнил еще нужное, вернулся сам, вернул повара и эконома и опять стал приказывать.

"Кутузов, не отвечая ему, отвернулся, и взгляд его нечаянно попал на князя Андрея, стоявшего подле него. Увидав Болконского, Кутузов смягчил злое и едкое выражение взгляда, как бы сознавая, что его адъютант не был виноват в том, что делалось. И, не отвечая австрийскому адъютанту, он обратился к Болконскому:","Kutuzov, without answering him, turned away, and his eyes accidentally fell on Prince Andrei, who was standing beside him. Seeing Bolkonsky, Kutuzov softened the angry and caustic expression of his gaze, as if realizing that his adjutant was not to blame for what was being done. And, without answering the Austrian adjutant, he turned to Bolkonsky:","Kutuzov turned away without answering him, and his gaze chanced to rest on Prince Andrei, who was standing close by.

"Два эскадрона павлоградцев, перейдя мост, один за другим, пошли назад на гору. Полковой командир Карл Богданович Шуберт подъехал к эскадрону Денисова и ехал шагом недалеко от Ростова, не обращая на него никакого внимания, несмотря на то, что после бывшего столкновения за Телянина, они виделись теперь в первый раз. Ростов, чувствуя себя во фронте во власти человека, перед которым он теперь считал себя виноватым, не спускал глаз с атлетической спины, белокурого затылка и красной шеи полкового командира. Ростову то казалось, что Богданыч только притворяется невнимательным, и что вся цель его теперь состоит в том, чтоб испытать храбрость юнкера, и он выпрямлялся и весело оглядывался; то ему казалось, что Богданыч нарочно едет близко, чтобы показать Ростову свою храбрость. То ему думалось, что враг его теперь нарочно пошлет эскадрон в отчаянную атаку, чтобы наказать его, Ростова. То думалось, что после атаки он подойдет к нему и великодушно протянет ему, раненому, руку примирения.","Two squadrons of Pavlograd, crossing the bridge, one after the other, went back to the mountain. Regimental commander Karl Bogdanovich Schubert drove up to Denisov's squadron and rode at a pace not far from Rostov, not paying any attention to him, despite the fact that after the previous clash over Telyanin, they now saw each other for the first time. Rostov, feeling at the front in the power of a man to whom he now considered himself guilty, did not take his eyes off the athletic back, blond nape and red neck of the regimental commander. It seemed to Rostov that Bogdanich was only pretending to be inattentive, and that his whole goal now was to test the courage of the cadet, and he straightened up and looked around merrily; then it seemed to him that Bogdanich was deliberately riding close to show Rostov his courage. Then he thought that his enemy would now deliberately send a squadron into a desperate attack in order to punish him, Rostov. It was thought that after the attack he would come up to him and generously extend to him, the wounded man, the hand of reconciliation.","Having crossed the bridge, the two squadrons of the Pavlogradsky hussars went back up the hill one after the other.

Rostov feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man towards whom he now admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the colonel’s athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red neck. It seemed to Rostov that Bogdanich was only pretending not to notice him, and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet’s courage, so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily; then it seemed to him that Bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage. Next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish him—Rostov. Then he imagined how, after the attack, Bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation."

"И разговор зашел опять о войне, о Бонапарте и нынешних генералах и государственных людях. Старый князь, казалось, был убежден не только в том, что все теперешние деятели были мальчишки, не смыслившие и азбуки военного и государственного дела, и что Бонапарте был ничтожный французишка, имевший успех только потому, что уже не было Потемкиных и Суворовых противопоставить ему; но он был убежден даже, что никаких политических затруднений не было в Европе, не было и войны, а была какая-то кукольная комедия, в которую играли нынешние люди, притворяясь, что делают дело.

The dear countess was too clever with Vera,” said the count. “Well, so what! She still turned out nice,” he added, winking at Vera approvingly.","‘What’s the good of denying it, ma chère?

"Пьер был у него под рукою в Москве, и князь Василий устроил для него назначение в камер-юнкеры, что тогда равнялось чину статского советника, и настоял на том, чтобы молодой человек с ним вместе ехал в Петербург и остановился в его доме. Как будто рассеянно и вместе с тем с несомненной уверенностью, что так должно быть, князь Василий делал всё, что было нужно для того, чтобы женить Пьера на своей дочери. Ежели бы князь Василий обдумывал вперед свои планы, он не мог бы иметь такой естественности в обращении и такой простоты и фамильярности в сношении со всеми людьми, выше и ниже себя поставленными. Что-то влекло его постоянно к людям сильнее или богаче его, и он одарен был редким искусством ловить именно ту минуту, когда надо и можно было пользоваться людьми.","Pierre was at hand in Moscow, and Prince Vasily arranged for him to be appointed to the chamber junkers, which then equaled the rank of state councilor, and insisted that the young man go with him to Petersburg and stay at his house. As if absent-mindedly and at the same time with undoubted confidence that this should be so, Prince Vasily did everything that was necessary in order to marry Pierre to his daughter. If Prince Vasily had thought ahead of his plans, he could not have had such naturalness in his manners and such simplicity and familiarity in dealing with all people placed above and below himself. Something constantly attracted him to people stronger or richer than he was, and he was gifted with a rare art of seizing precisely that moment when it was necessary and possible to use people.","He had Pierre at hand in Moscow, and Prince Vassily arranged for him an appointment as gentleman of the bedchamber, which was then equal to the rank of state councillor, and insisted that the young man should go with him to Petersburg and stay in his house. As if absentmindedly and at the same time with an indubitable assurance that it had to be so, Prince Vassily did everything necessary to have Pierre marry his daughter. If Prince Vassily had thought out his plans beforehand, he would not have had such naturalness in his dealings and such simplicity and familiarity in his relations with all people, whether of higher or lower station than himself. Something constantly drew him to people more powerful or richer than he, and he was endowed with the rare art of seizing the precise moment when he should and could make use of people.","He had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the status of Councillor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to Petersburg and staying at his house.

Had he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody, both above and below him in social standing. Something always drew him towards those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people."
"— Ваше благородие, вот он! — проговорил сзади один из гусар.","“Your honor, here it is!” said one of the hussars from behind.","“There he is, Your Honor!” one of the hussars said behind him.","‘Your honour, there he is!’ cried one of the hussars behind him."
"В 6-м часу только у плотины Аугеста еще слышалась жаркая канонада одних французов, выстроивших многочисленные батареи на спуске Праценских высот и бивших по нашим отступающим войскам.","At 6 o'clock, only at the Augusta dam, the hot cannonade of some Frenchmen could still be heard, who had built numerous batteries on the descent of the Pracen Heights and were beating at our retreating troops.","After five o'clock it was only at the dam of Augesd that the hot cannon fire of the French alone could be heard, from numerous batteries lined up on the slopes of the Pratzen heights and firing at our retreating troops.","After five o’clock it was only at the Augesd dam that a hot cannonade (delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen heights, directed at our retreating forces."
Анна Павловна задумалась.,Anna Pavlovna thought for a moment.,Anna Pavlovna fell to thinking.,Anna Pavlovna meditated.
"«Теперь всё равно: уж ежели государь ранен, неужели мне беречь себя?» думал он. Он въехал в то пространство, на котором более всего погибло людей, бегущих с Працена. Французы еще не занимали этого места, а русские, те, которые были живы или ранены, давно оставили его. На поле, как копны на хорошей пашне, лежало человек десять, пятнадцать убитых, раненых на каждой десятине места. Раненые сползались по два, по три вместе, и слышались неприятные, иногда притворные, как казалось Ростову, их крики и стоны. Ростов пустил лошадь рысью, чтобы не видать всех этих страдающих людей, и ему стало страшно. Он боялся не за свою жизнь, а за то мужество, которое ему нужно было и которое, он знал, не выдержит вида этих несчастных.","“Now it doesn’t matter: if the sovereign is wounded, can I really take care of myself?” he thought. He drove into the space where most of the people who fled from Pratsen died. The French had not yet occupied this place, and the Russians, those who were alive or wounded, had long since left it. On the field, like shocks on a good arable land, there were ten people, fifteen killed, wounded on every tithe of the place. The wounded crawled down in twos, threes together, and unpleasant, sometimes feigned, as it seemed to Rostov, their cries and groans were heard. Rostov trotted his horse so as not to see all these suffering people, and he became afraid. He was afraid not for his life, but for the courage he needed and which, he knew, would not withstand the sight of these unfortunates.","“It makes no difference now! If even the sovereign is wounded, why should I look out for myself?” he thought. He rode into that space in which the most men fleeing from Pratz had been killed. The French had not yet taken this space, but the Russians—those who were alive or wounded—had abandoned it long ago. Over the field, like sheaves on good wheatland, lay dead or wounded men, ten to fifteen to an acre. The wounded crept together by twos and threes, and one could hear their unpleasant cries and moans, sometimes feigned, as it seemed to Rostov. He sent his horse into a canter, so as not to see all these suffering men, and he felt frightened. He was afraid, not for his life, but for the courage he needed and which, he knew, could not bear the sight of these wretches.","‘It’s all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to save myself?’ he thought. He rode on to the region where the greatest number of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen. The French had not yet occupied that region, and the Russians—the uninjured and slightly wounded—had left it long ago. All about the field, like heaps of manure on well-kept plough-land, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres. The wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing screams and groans, sometimes feigned—or so it seemed to Rostov. He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men, and he felt afraid—not for his life, but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates."
"«Мне до этого дела нет!» подумал он. Не успел он проехать нескольких сот шагов после этого, как влево от него, наперерез ему, показалась на всем протяжении поля огромная масса кавалеристов на вороных лошадях, в белых блестящих мундирах, которые рысью шли прямо на него. Ростов пустил лошадь во весь скок, для того чтоб уехать с дороги от этих кавалеристов, и он бы уехал от них, ежели бы они шли всё тем же аллюром, но они всё прибавляли хода, так что некоторые лошади уже скакали. Ростову всё слышнее и слышнее становился их топот и бряцание их оружия и виднее становились их лошади, фигуры и даже лица. Это были наши кавалергарды, шедшие в атаку на французскую кавалерию, подвигавшуюся им навстречу.","""I don't care about that!"" he thought. Before he had gone a few hundred paces after that, to the left of him, in front of him, appeared throughout the field a huge mass of cavalrymen on black horses, in shiny white uniforms, who trotted straight at him. Rostov set his horse at full gallop in order to get out of the way from these cavalrymen, and he would have left them if they were still walking at the same gait, but they kept gaining speed, so that some horses were already galloping. Rostov became more and more audible to their clatter and rattling of their weapons, and their horses, figures and even faces became more visible. These were our cavalry guards attacking the French cavalry advancing towards them.","“It's none of my business!” he thought. He had not managed to go a few hundred paces after that when to the left of him, cutting across, there appeared along the whole width of the field an enormous mass of cavalrymen on black horses, in white gleaming uniforms, coming straight at him at a canter. Rostov sent his horse into a full gallop to get out of the way of these cavalrymen, and he would have gotten away from them if they had continued at the same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the horses were already galloping. Rostov heard their hoofbeats and the clanging of their weapons growing louder and louder, and saw their horses, their figures, and even their faces more and more clearly. These were our horse guards going into attack against the French cavalry, which was coming towards them.","‘That is no business of mine,’ he thought. He had not ridden many hundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole width of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight towards him and across his path. Rostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men, and he would have got clear had they continued at the same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the horses were already galloping. Rostov heard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their figures, and even their faces, more and more distinctly. They were our Horse Guards, advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them."
"Только что князь Андрей отъехал, он остановил его.","As soon as Prince Andrei drove off, he stopped him.",Prince Andrei had only just started when he stopped him.,Hardly had Prince Andrei started than he stopped him.
"Впрочем, если российский император согласится на упомянутое условие, я тоже соглашусь; но это не что иное, как хитрость. Идите, уничтожьте русскую армию… Вы можете взять ее обозы и ее артиллерию.","However, if the Russian emperor agrees to the mentioned condition, I will also agree; but this is nothing but a trick.

"И он, казалось, распускался весь от удовольствия. Едва он договорил, как опять раздался неожиданно страшный свист, вдруг прекратившийся ударом во что-то жидкое, и ш-ш-ш-шлеп — казак, ехавший несколько правее и сзади аудитора, с лошадью рухнулся на землю. Жерков и дежурный штаб-офицер пригнулись к седлам и прочь поворотили лошадей. Аудитор остановился против казака, со внимательным любопытством рассматривая его. Казак был мертв, лошадь еще билась.","And he seemed to be full of pleasure. As soon as he finished speaking, an unexpectedly terrible whistle was heard again, which suddenly stopped with a blow to something liquid, and sh-sh-sh-slap - a Cossack, riding somewhat to the right and behind the auditor, with his horse collapsed to the ground. Zherkov and the duty officer crouched down in their saddles and turned the horses away. The auditor stopped in front of the Cossack, examining him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, the horse was still beating.","And he seemed to melt all over with satisfaction.

Zherkov and the staff officer on duty crouched low to their saddles and turned their horses away. The auditor stopped in front of the Cossack, examining him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, the horse was still thrashing.","He seemed to swell with satisfaction.

Zherkov and the staff-officer bent over their saddles and turned their horses away. The accountant stopped facing the Cossack and examined him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but the horse still struggled."

"Ежели первое время члены совета думали, что Кутузов притворялся спящим, то звуки, которые он издавал носом во время последующего чтения, доказывали, что в эту минуту для главнокомандующего дело шло о гораздо важнейшем, чем о желании выказать свое презрение к диспозиции или к чему бы то ни было: дело шло для него о неудержимом удовлетворении человеческой потребности — сна. Он действительно спал. Вейротер с движением человека, слишком занятого для того, чтобы терять хоть одну минуту времени, взглянул на Кутузова и, убедившись, что он спит, взял бумагу и громким однообразным тоном начал читать диспозицию будущего сражения под заглавием, которое он тоже прочел:","If at first the members of the council thought that Kutuzov was pretending to be asleep, then the sounds that he made with his nose during the subsequent reading proved that at that moment the matter was much more important for the commander-in-chief than the desire to show his contempt for the disposition or for what be that as it may: it was a matter for him of the irresistible satisfaction of a human need - sleep. He really slept. Weyrother, with the movement of a man too busy to waste even one minute of time, looked at Kutuzov and, making sure that he was asleep, took the paper and in a loud monotonous tone began to read the disposition of the future battle under the title, which he also read:","If the members of the council at first thought Kutuzov was pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose produced during the reading that followed proved that for the commander in chief at that moment the point of the matter was something far more important than a wish to show his contempt for the disposition or for anything at all: the point of the matter was to satisfy the irresistible human need for sleep. He was indeed asleep. Weyrother, with the gesture of a man who is too busy to waste even a moment of his time, glanced at Kutuzov and, assuring himself that he was asleep, took up the paper and began to read the disposition for the future battle in a loud, monotonous tone, under the title, which he also read:","If at first the members of the council thought that Kutuzov was pretending to be asleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed proved that the commander-in-chief at that moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything else—he was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep. He really was asleep. Weyrother, with the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at Kutuzov and having convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in a loud monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the impending battle, under a heading which he also read out:"

За дверью послышался смех.","- Is that your sword? he shouted. The girls jumped back. Denisov, with frightened eyes, hid his shaggy legs in a blanket, looking around for help at his comrade. The door let Petya through and closed again. There was laughter outside the door.","“Is this your saber?” he shouted. The girls jumped away.

"Сказав «ну»! он повернулся опять, отпустил руки, взял бутылку и поднес ко рту, закинул назад голову и вскинул кверху свободную руку для перевеса. Один из лакеев, начавший подбирать стекла, остановился в согнутом положении, не спуская глаз с окна и спины Долохова. Анатоль стоял прямо, разинув глаза. Англичанин, выпятив вперед губы, смотрел сбоку. Тот, который останавливал, убежал в угол комнаты и лег на диван лицом к стене. Пьер закрыл лицо, и слабая улыбка, забывшись, осталась на его лице, хоть оно теперь выражало ужас и страх. Все молчали. Пьер отнял от глаз руки: Долохов сидел всё в том же положении, только голова загнулась назад, так что курчавые волосы затылка прикасались к воротнику рубахи, и рука с бутылкой поднималась всё выше и выше, содрогаясь и делая усилие. Бутылка видимо опорожнялась и с тем вместе поднималась, загибая голову. «Что же это так долго?» подумал Пьер. Ему казалось, что прошло больше получаса. Вдруг Долохов сделал движение назад спиной, и рука его нервически задрожала; этого содрогания было достаточно, чтобы сдвинуть всё тело, сидевшее на покатом откосе. Он сдвинулся весь, и еще сильнее задрожали, делая усилие, рука и голова его. Одна рука поднялась, чтобы схватиться за подоконник, но опять опустилась. Пьер опять закрыл глаза и сказал себе, что никогда уж не откроет их. Вдруг он почувствовал, что всё вокруг зашевелилось. Он взглянул: Долохов стоял на подоконнике, лицо его было бледно и весело.","Saying ""well""! he turned again, let go of his hands, took the bottle and raised it to his mouth, threw back his head and threw up his free hand for an advantage. One of the footmen, who had begun to pick up the glass, stopped in a bent position, without taking his eyes off the window and Dolokhov's back. Anatole stood straight, his eyes wide. The Englishman, pursing his lips forward, looked sideways. The one who stopped him ran to the corner of the room and lay down on the sofa facing the wall. Pierre covered his face, and a faint smile, forgotten, remained on his face, although it now expressed horror and fear. Everyone was silent. Pierre took his hands away from his eyes: Dolokhov was still sitting in the same position, only his head was bent back, so that the curly hair of the back of his head touched the collar of his shirt, and the hand with the bottle rose higher and higher, shuddering and making an effort. The bottle apparently emptied and at the same time rose, bending its head. ""Why is it taking so long?"" thought Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had passed. Suddenly Dolokhov made a backward movement with his back, and his hand trembled nervously; this shudder was enough to move the whole body, sitting on a sloping slope. He moved all over, and his hand and head trembled even more, making an effort. One hand went up to grab the window sill, but went down again. Pierre closed his eyes again and told himself that he would never open them again. Suddenly, he felt everything around him move. He looked: Dolokhov was standing on the windowsill, his face was pale and cheerful.","Having said “So!” he turned back again, let go with his hands, took the bottle and put it to his lips, threw his head back, and thrust his free arm up for balance. One of the lackeys, who had begun picking up the glass, stopped in a bent position, not taking his eyes from the window and Dolokhov's back. Anatole stood erect, his eyes gaping. The Englishman, his lips thrust out, watched from the side. The man who had tried to stop them rushed to the corner of the room and lay down on a sofa, face to the wall. Pierre covered his face, and a faint smile remained forgotten on it, though it now expressed terror and fear, Everyone was silent. Pierre took his hands away from his eyes. Dolokhov was sitting in the same position, only his head was thrown far back, so that the curly hair of his nape touched the collar of his shirt, and the hand holding the bottle rose higher and higher, trembling and making an effort. The bottle was apparently emptying and rising at the same time, pushing the head back. “Why is it taking so long?” thought Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had gone by. Suddenly Dolokhov made a backward movement, and his arm trembled nervously; this shudder was enough to shift his whole body, which was sitting on the sloping ledge. He shifted completely, and his arm and head trembled still more from the effort. One arm rose to take hold of the windowsill, but lowered itself again. Pierre again shut his eyes and said to himself that he was never going to open them. Suddenly he felt everything around him stirring. He looked: Dolokhov was standing on the windowsill, his face pale and merry.","Now then!’ Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass, remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from Dolokhov’s back. Anatole stood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hand from his eyes, Dolokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back. ‘Why is it so long?’ thought Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dolokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the window-sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around. He looked up: Dolokhov was standing on the window-sill with a pale but radiant face."

But this head swayed helplessly from the uneven steps of the carriers, and the cold, indifferent gaze did not know where to rest.","As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikhailovna, passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying man ’s high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his grey, curly, leonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones, its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was not disfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as Pierre remembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to Petersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing."
"Все желания его исполнялись в это утро; давалось генеральное сражение, он участвовал в нем; мало того, он был ординарцем при храбрейшем генерале; мало того, он ехал с поручением к Кутузову, а может быть, и к самому государю. Утро было ясное, лошадь под ним была добрая. На душе его было радостно и счастливо. Получив приказание, он пустил лошадь и поскакал вдоль по линии. Сначала он ехал по линии Багратионовых войск, еще не вступавших в дело и стоявших неподвижно; потом он въехал в пространство, занимаемое кавалерией Уварова и здесь заметил уже передвижения и признаки приготовлений к делу; проехав кавалерию Уварова, он уже ясно услыхал звуки пушечной и орудийной стрельбы впереди себя. Стрельба всё усиливалась.","All his desires were fulfilled this morning; a general battle was given, he participated in it; moreover, he was an orderly under the bravest general; moreover, he went on an assignment to Kutuzov, and perhaps to the sovereign himself. The morning was clear, the horse under it was kind. His heart was full of joy and happiness. Having received the order, he started his horse and galloped along the line. At first he rode along the line of Bagration's troops, who had not yet entered into action and stood motionless; then he rode into the space occupied by Uvarov's cavalry and here he already noticed movements and signs of preparations for the case; having passed Uvarov's cavalry, he already clearly heard the sounds of cannon and cannon fire in front of him. The shooting intensified.","All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: general battle was to be given, he was to take part in it; moreover, he was an orderly officer of the bravest of generals; moreover, he was going with a message to Kutuzov and maybe to the sovereign himself.

At first he rode along the line of Bagration’s troops, which had not yet advanced into action but were standing motionless; then he came to the region occupied by Uvarov’s cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle; having passed Uvarov’s cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him. The firing grew louder and louder."

"Из молодежи, не считая старшей дочери графини (которая была четырьмя годами старше сестры и держала себя уже, как большая) и гостьи-барышни, в гостиной остались Николай и Соня-племянница. Соня была тоненькая, миниатюрненькая брюнетка с мягким, отененным длинными ресницами взглядом, густой черною косой, два раза обвившею ее голову, и желтоватым оттенком кожи на лице и в особенности на обнаженных худощавых, но грациозных мускулистых руках и шее. Плавностью движений, мягкостью и гибкостью маленьких членов и несколько хитрою и сдержанною манерой она напоминала красивого, но еще не сформировавшегося котенка, который будет прелестною кошечкой. Она, видимо, считала приличным выказывать улыбкой участие к общему разговору; но против воли ее глаза из-под длинных густых ресниц смотрели на уезжавшего в армию cousin [двоюродного брата] с таким девическим страстным обожанием, что улыбка ее не могла ни на мгновение обмануть никого, и видно было, что кошечка присела только для того, чтоб еще энергичнее прыгнуть и заиграть с своим соusin, как скоро только они так же, как Борис с Наташей, выберутся из этой гостиной.","Of the young people, not counting the eldest daughter of the countess (who was four years older than her sister and already behaved like a big one) and the young lady guests, Nikolai and Sonya the niece remained in the drawing room. Sonya was a thin, petite brunette with a soft look tinted with long eyelashes, a thick black plait that twined around her head twice, and a yellowish tint of skin on her face and especially on her naked, thin, but graceful muscular arms and neck. With her smoothness of movement, the softness and suppleness of her small limbs, and her somewhat cunning and restrained manner, she resembled a beautiful, but not yet formed kitten, who would be a lovely kitty. She apparently considered it proper to show participation in the general conversation with a smile; but against her will, her eyes from under long thick eyelashes looked at her cousin [cousin] leaving for the army with such girlish passionate adoration that her smile could not deceive anyone for a moment, and it was clear that the cat sat down only to jump even more energetically and play with your soul as soon as they, just like Boris and Natasha, get out of this living room.","Of the young people, not including the countess's elder daughter (who was four years older than her sister and already behaved like an adult), and the young lady guest, only Nikolai and the niece Sonya remained in the drawing room.

By the grace of her movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like Natasha and Boris, escape from the drawing-room."

"Счастливо проскакав между французами, он подскакал к полю за лесом, через который бежали наши и, не слушаясь команды, спускались под гору. Наступила та минута нравственного колебания, которая решает участь сражений: послушают эти расстроенные толпы солдат голоса своего командира или, оглянувшись на него, побегут дальше. Несмотря на отчаянный крик прежде столь грозного для солдата голоса полкового командира, несмотря на разъяренное, багровое, на себя не похожее лицо полкового командира и маханье шпагой, солдаты всё бежали, разговаривали, стреляли в воздух и не слушали команды.

"Молодая княгиня Болконская приехала с работой в шитом золотом бархатном мешке. Ее хорошенькая, с чуть черневшимися усиками верхняя губка была коротка по зубам, но тем милее она открывалась и тем еще милее вытягивалась иногда и опускалась на нижнюю. Как это всегда бывает у вполне-привлекательных женщин, недостаток ее — короткость губы и полуоткрытый рот — казались ее особенною, собственно ее красотой. Всем было весело смотреть на эту, полную здоровья и живости, хорошенькую будущую мать, так легко переносившую свое положение. Старикам и скучающим, мрачным молодым людям, смотревшим на нее, казалось, что они сами делаются похожи на нее, побыв и поговорив несколько времени с ней. Кто говорил с ней и видел при каждом слове ее светлую улыбочку и блестящие белые зубы, которые виднелись беспрестанно, тот думал, что он особенно нынче любезен. И это думал каждый.","The young princess Bolkonskaya arrived with work in an embroidered gold velvet bag. Her pretty, with a slightly blackened mustache, her upper lip was short in teeth, but it opened all the nicer and stretched out even more nicely sometimes and fell on the lower one. As is always the case with quite attractive women, her shortcomings—the shortness of her lips and her half-open mouth—seemed to be her special, her own beauty. It was fun for everyone to look at this pretty mother-to-be, full of health and liveliness, who so easily endured her situation. It seemed to the old men and the bored, gloomy young people who looked at her that they themselves were becoming like her after spending some time talking with her. Anyone who spoke to her and saw at every word her bright smile and shining white teeth, which were constantly visible, thought that he was especially amiable today. And that's what everyone thought.","The young princess Bolkonsky came with handwork in a gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty upper lip with its barely visible black mustache was too short for her teeth, but the more sweetly did it open and still more sweetly did it sometimes stretch and close on the lower one.

Everyone felt cheerful looking at this pretty future mother full of health and liveliness, who bore her condition so easily. To old men and to bored, morose young ones it seemed that they themselves came to resemble her, having been with her and spoken with her for a time.

As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect—the shortness of her upper lip and her half open mouth—seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull, dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life and health.

"— Нет, — говорил он, все более и более одушевляясь, — Наполеон велик, потому что он стал выше революции, подавил ее злоупотребления, удержав всё хорошее — и равенство граждан, и свободу слова и печати — и только потому приобрел власть.","“No,” he said, becoming more and more animated, “Napoleon is great because he rose above the revolution, suppressed its abuses, retained all that was good — both the equality of citizens, and freedom of speech and the press — and only because of this did he acquire power.","“No,” he said, growing more and more inspired, “Napoleon is great, because he stood above the revolution, put an end to its abuses, and kept all that was good—the equality of citizens and freedom of speech and of the press—and that is the only reason why he gained power.”","‘No,’ cried he, becoming more and more eager, ‘Napoleon is great because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses, preserved all that was good in it—equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press—and only for that reason did he obtain power.’"
"С фрунтовым самодовольством он шел легко на мускулистых ногах, точно он плыл, без малейшего усилия вытягиваясь и отличаясь этою легкостью от тяжелого шага солдат, шедших по его шагу. Он нес у ноги вынутую тоненькую, узенькую шпагу (гнутую шпажку, не похожую на оружие) и, оглядываясь то на начальство, то назад, не теряя шагу, гибко поворачивался всем своим сильным станом. Казалось, все силы души его были направлены на то, чтобы наилучшим образом пройти мимо начальства, и, чувствуя, что он исполняет это дело хорошо, он был счастлив. «Левой… левой… левой…», казалось, внутренно приговаривал он через каждый шаг, и по этому такту с разно-образно-строгими лицами двигалась стена солдатских фигур, отягченных ранцами и ружьями, как будто каждый из этих сотен солдат мысленно через шаг приговаривал: «левой… левой… левой…». Толстый майор, пыхтя и разрознивая шаг, обходил куст по дороге; отставший солдат, запыхавшись, с испуганным лицом за свою неисправность, рысью догонял роту; ядро, нажимая воздух, пролетело над головой князя Багратиона и свиты и в такт: «левой — левой!» ударилось в колонну. «Сомкнись!» послышался щеголяющий голос ротного командира. Солдаты дугой обходили что-то в том месте, куда упало ядро; старый кавалер, фланговый унтер-офицер, отстав около убитых, догнал свой ряд, подпрыгнув, переменил ногу, попал в шаг и сердито оглянулся. «Левой… левой… левой…», казалось, слышалось из-за угрожающего молчания и однообразного звука единовременно ударяющих о землю ног.","With ruthless self-satisfaction, he walked lightly on muscular legs, as if he were swimming, stretching himself without the slightest effort and differing in this lightness from the heavy step of the soldiers walking along his step. He carried at his foot a thin, narrow sword (a bent skewer that did not look like a weapon) at his foot, and, looking now at his superiors, then back, without losing a step, flexibly turned with his whole strong camp. It seemed that all the strength of his soul was directed towards getting past the authorities in the best possible way, and, feeling that he was doing this job well, he was happy. “Left…left…left…”, he seemed to say inwardly every step, and according to this tact, with variously strict faces, a wall of soldiers’ figures, weighed down with satchels and guns, moved, as if each of these hundreds of soldiers mentally sentenced every step : ""left ... left ... left ..."". The fat major, puffing and breaking his pace, went around the bush along the road; a lagging soldier, out of breath, with a frightened face for his malfunction, was trotting up to the company; the ball, pressing the air, flew over the head of Prince Bagration and his retinue and in time: “left - left!” hit the column. ""Close up!"" I heard the flaunting voice of the company commander. The soldiers arced around something in the place where the ball had fallen; the old gentleman, a flank non-commissioned officer, lagging behind the dead, caught up with his line, jumped up, changed his foot, caught a step and looked around angrily. “Left…left…left…” seemed to be heard because of the threatening silence and the monotonous sound of feet hitting the ground at the same time.","With a parade-like self-satisfaction, he marched lightly on his muscular legs, as if floating, holding himself straight without the least effort, and distinguishing himself by this lightness from the heavy tread of the soldiers who marched in step with him. He carried by his leg an unsheathed, thin, and narrow sword (a curved little sword, not resembling a weapon), and he lithely turned his whole strong body, looking now at his superior, now behind him, without losing step. It seemed that all the forces of his soul were aimed at marching past his superior in the best possible way, and, feeling that he was doing it well, he was happy. “Left... left... left...” he seemed to be saying to himself at every other step, and the wall of soldiers' figures, burdened by packs and muskets, with variously stern faces, moved to this rhythm, as if each of those hundreds of soldiers was mentally saying: “Left... left... left...” at every other step. A fat major, puffing and breaking the step, turned around a bush that was in his way; a lagging soldier, breathless, with a frightened face because of his negligence, trotted to catch up with his company; a cannonball, pushing through the air, flew over the heads of Prince Bagration and his suite, and to the rhythm of “Left... left... left!” struck the column. “Close ranks!” came the dashing voice of the company commander. The soldiers curved around something at the spot where the cannonball had landed, and a decorated old soldier, a sergeant on the flank, after lingering by the dead men, caught up with his line, skipped to change feet, fell into step, and looked back angrily. “Left... left... left...” seemed to be heard through the ominous silence and the monotonous sound of feet simultaneously tramping the ground.","With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and not like a real weapon) and looked now at the superior officers and now back at his men without losing step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well, he was happy. ‘Left … left … left …’ he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step; and in time to this with stern but varied faces, the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets, marched in step, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each alternate step, ‘Left … left … left …’ A fat major skirted a bush, puffing and falling out of step; a soldier who had fallen behind, his face showing alarm at his defection, ran at a trot, panting, to catch up with his company. A cannon-ball cleaving the air flew over the heads of Bagration and his suite and fell into the column to the measure of ‘Left … left!’ ‘Close up!’ came the company commander’s voice in jaunty tones. The soldiers passed in a semi-circle round something where the ball had fallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a non-commissioned officer, who had stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and falling into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one seemed to hear left … left … left."
"Французы, переставшие стрелять по этому, усеянному мертвыми и ранеными, полю, потому что уже никого на нем живого не было, увидав едущего по нем адъютанта, навели на него орудие и бросили несколько ядер.

Всё в его фигуре, начиная от усталого, скучающего взгляда до тихого мерного шага, представляло самую резкую противоположность с его маленькою, оживленною женой. Ему, видимо, все бывшие в гостиной не только были знакомы, но уж надоели ему так, что и смотреть на них и слушать их ему было очень скучно. Из всех же прискучивших ему лиц, лицо его хорошенькой жены, казалось, больше всех ему надоело. С гримасой, портившею его красивое лицо, он отвернулся от нее. Он поцеловал руку Анны Павловны и, щурясь, оглядел всё общество.","At that moment, a new face entered the living room. The new face was the young Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, the husband of the little princess. Prince Bolkonsky was short, a very handsome young man with definite and dry features. Everything in his figure, from the tired, bored look to the quiet measured step, represented the sharpest contrast with his small, lively wife. He, apparently, was not only familiar with everyone in the drawing room, but he was so tired of it that it was very boring for him to look at them and listen to them. Of all the faces that bored him, the face of his pretty wife seemed to bore him the most. With a grimace that marred his handsome face, he turned away from her. He kissed Anna Pavlovna's hand and, screwing up his eyes, looked around the whole company.","Just then a new person entered the drawing room. This new person was the young Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, the little princess's husband. Prince Bolkonsky was of medium height, a rather handsome young man with well-defined and dry features. Everything in his figure, from his weary, bored gaze to his quiet, measured gait, presented the sharpest contrast with his small, lively wife. Obviously, he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but was also so sick of them that it was very boring for him to look at them and listen to them. Of all the faces he found so boring, the face of his pretty wife seemed to be the one he was most sick of. With a grimace that spoiled his handsome face, he turned away from her. He kissed Anna Pavlovna's hand and, narrowing his eyes, looked around at the whole company.","Just then another visitor entered the drawing-room: Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, the little princess’s husband. He was a very handsome young man, of medium height, with firm, clear-cut features. Everything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, offered a most striking contrast to his lively little wife. It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing-room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna Pavlovna’s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company."

"— Taisez vous, mauvaise langue, [Удержите ваше злоязычие. ] — сказал Долгоруков. — Неправда, теперь уже два русских: Милорадович и Дохтуров, и был бы 3-й, граф Аракчеев, но у него нервы слабы.","- Taisez vous, mauvaise langue, [Stop your slander. ] — said Dolgorukov. - It's not true, now there are two Russians: Miloradovich and Dokhturov, and there would be a 3rd, Count Arakcheev, but his nerves are weak.","] “Taisez-vous, mauvaise langue,”[264] said Dolgomkov. “It's not true, there are now two Russians: Miloradovich and Dokhturov, and there would have been a third, Count Arakcheev, but he has weak nerves.”","‘Taisez-vous, mauvaise langue!’2 said Dolgorukov. ‘It is not true; there are now two Russians, Miloradovich and Dokhturov, and there would be a third, Count Arakcheev, if his nerves were not too weak.’"
"Французы, как доносил лазутчик, перейдя мост в Вене, усиленным маршем шли на Цнайм, лежавший на пути отступления Кутузова, впереди его более чем на сто верст. Достигнуть Цнайма прежде французов — значило получить большую надежду на спасение армии; дать французам предупредить себя в Цнайме — значило наверное подвергнуть всю армию позору, подобному ульмскому, или общей гибели. Но предупредить французов со всею армией было невозможно. Дорога французов от Вены до Цнайма была короче и лучше, чем дорога русских от Кремса до Цнайма.","The French, as the scout reported, having crossed the bridge in Vienna, marched in a reinforced march to Znaim, which lay on the path of Kutuzov's retreat, more than a hundred miles ahead of him. To reach Znaim before the French meant to gain great hope of saving the army; to let the French warn oneself at Znaim meant surely to expose the whole army to a disgrace similar to that of Ulm, or to total destruction. But it was impossible to warn the French with the whole army. The French road from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the Russian road from Krems to Znaim.","The French, as the scout reported, had crossed the bridge in Vienna and by forced marches were making for Znaim, which lay on the path of Kutuzov's retreat, more than sixty miles ahead of him.

The road from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the Russians' road from Krems to Znaim.","The French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge were advancing by forced marches towards Znaim, which lay a hundred versts off on the line of Kutuzov’s retreat.

"Он забылся на одну минуту, но в этот короткий промежуток забвения он видел во сне бесчисленное количество предметов: он видел свою мать и ее большую белую руку, видел худенькие плечи Сони, глаза и смех Наташи, и Денисова с его голосом и усами, и Телянина, и всю свою историю с Теляниным и Богданычем. Вся эта история была одно и то же, что этот солдат с резким голосом, и эта-то вся история и этот-то солдат так мучительно, неотступно держали, давили и все в одну сторону тянули его руку. Он пытался устраняться от них, но они не отпускали ни на волос, ни на секунду его плечо. Оно бы не болело, оно было бы здорово, ежели б они не тянули его; но нельзя было избавиться от них.","He forgot himself for one minute, but in this short interval of oblivion he saw countless objects in a dream: he saw his mother and her big white hand, saw Sonya's thin shoulders, Natasha's eyes and laughter, and Denisov with his voice and mustache, and Telyanin , and all his history with Telyanin and Bogdanych. This whole story was one and the same, that this soldier with a sharp voice, and this whole story and this one soldier so painfully, relentlessly held, crushed, and everyone pulled his hand in one direction. He tried to move away from them, but they did not let go of his hair, not even for a second on his shoulder.

That affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice, and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly, incessantly, pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction. He tried to get away from them, but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair’s breadth. It would not ache —it would be well—if only they did not pull it, but it was impossible to get rid of them."
"Князь Андрей еще раз взглянул на фигурку артиллериста. В ней было что-то особенное, совершенно не военное, несколько комическое, но чрезвычайно привлекательное.","Prince Andrei glanced once more at the figurine of the gunner. There was something special about her, not at all military, somewhat comical, but extremely attractive.","Prince Andrei looked once more at the little figure of the artillerist.

"— Старайтесь как можно более расхваливать порядок в доставлении провианта и маршрутов, когда будете говорить с императором, — сказал Билибин, провожая до передней Болконского.","“Try as much as possible to praise the order in the delivery of provisions and routes when you talk with the emperor,” said Bilibin, escorting Bolkonsky to the front.","“Try to praise the order for the delivery of provisions and the itineraries as much as possible to the emperor,” said Bilibin, seeing Bolkonsky off to the front hall.","‘When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,’ said Bilibin, accompanying him to the hall."
"Князь Андрей, видя настоятельность требования отца, сначала неохотно, но потом все более и более оживляясь и невольно, посреди рассказа, по привычке, перейдя с русского на французский язык, начал излагать операционный план предполагаемой кампании. Он рассказал, как девяностотысячная армия должна была угрожать Пруссии, чтобы вывести ее из нейтралитета и втянуть в войну, как часть этих войск должна была в Штральзунде соединиться с шведскими войсками, как двести двадцать тысяч австрийцев, в соединении со ста тысячами русских, должны были действовать в Италии и на Рейне, и как пятьдесят тысяч русских и пятьдесят тысяч англичан высадятся в Неаполе, и как в итоге пятисоттысячная армия должна была с разных сторон сделать нападение на французов. Старый князь не выказал ни малейшего интереса при рассказе, как будто не слушал, и, продолжая на ходу одеваться, три раза неожиданно перервал его. Один раз он остановил его и закричал:","Prince Andrei, seeing the urgency of his father's demand, at first reluctantly, but then more and more animated and involuntarily, in the middle of the story, out of habit, switching from Russian to French, began to outline the operational plan of the proposed campaign.

"Полковой командир был пожилой, сангвинический, с седеющими бровями и бакенбардами генерал, плотный и широкий больше от груди к спине, чем от одного плеча к другому. На нем был новый, с иголочки, со слежавшимися складками мундир и густые золотые эполеты, которые как будто не книзу, а кверху поднимали его тучные плечи. Полковой командир имел вид человека, счастливо совершающего одно из самых торжественных дел жизни. Он похаживал перед фронтом и, похаживая, подрагивал на каждом шагу, слегка изгибаясь спиною. Видно, было, что полковой командир любуется своим полком, счастлив им, что все его силы душевные заняты только полком; но, несмотря на то, его подрагивающая походка как-будто говорила, что, кроме военных интересов, в душе его немалое место занимают и интересы общественного быта и женский пол.","The regimental commander was an elderly, sanguine general with graying eyebrows and sideburns, thick and broad more from chest to back than from one shoulder to the other. He was wearing a new, brand-new uniform with crumpled folds, and thick golden epaulettes, which, as it were, lifted his stout shoulders upwards rather than downwards. The regimental commander looked like a man happily doing one of the most solemn deeds of life. He paced in front of the front and, as he walked, trembled at every step, slightly arching his back. It was evident that the regimental commander was admiring his regiment, happy with them, that all his mental strength was occupied only by the regiment; but, despite the fact, his trembling gait seemed to say that, in addition to military interests, the interests of social life and the female gender also occupy a considerable place in his soul.","The regimental commander was an elderly, sanguine general with grizzled eyebrows and side-whiskers, stocky and broader from chest to back than from shoulder to shoulder.

The regimental commander had the look of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties in life. He strolled about before the front line, bouncing at each step as he strolled, and arching his back slightly. It was clear that the regimental commander admired his regiment, was happy with it, and that all his inner forces were taken up only with the regiment; but, in spite of that, his bouncing gait seemed to say that, besides military interests, no small part of his soul was taken up by the interests of social life and the female sex.","The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout and thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and moustaches, and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders.

He had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that besides military matters social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts."
"Полковой командир, сам подойдя к рядам, распорядился переодеванием опять в шинели. Ротные командиры разбежались по ротам, фельдфебели засуетились (шинели были не совсем исправны) и в то же мгновение заколыхались, растянулись и говором загудели прежде правильные, молчаливые четвероугольники.

"Все гости совершали обряд приветствования никому неизвестной, никому неинтересной и ненужной тетушки. Анна Павловна с грустным, торжественным участием следила за их приветствиями, молчаливо одобряя их. Ma tante каждому говорила в одних и тех же выражениях о его здоровье, о своем здоровье и о здоровье ее величества, которое нынче было, слава Богу, лучше. Все подходившие, из приличия не выказывая поспешности, с чувством облегчения исполненной тяжелой обязанности отходили от старушки, чтобы уж весь вечер ни разу не подойти к ней.","All the guests performed the ceremony of greeting an unknown, uninteresting and unnecessary aunt. Anna Pavlovna followed their greetings with sad, solemn sympathy, tacitly approving them. Ma tante spoke to everyone in the same terms about his health, about her health and about the health of Her Majesty, which today was, thank God, better. All those who approached, out of decency not showing haste, with a sense of relief from the heavy duty they had performed, moved away from the old woman, so that they would not go up to her all evening.","All the guests performed the ritual of greeting the totally unknown, totally uninteresting and unnecessary aunt. With sad, solemn sympathy, Anna Pavlovna followed their greetings, silently approving of them. To each of them ma tante spoke in the same expressions about his health, her own health, and the health of her majesty, which, thank God, was better that day. All those who went up to her, showing no haste for propriety's sake, left the little old lady with a feeling of relief after the fulfillment of a heavy obligation, never to approach her again all evening.","Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them cared about; Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of her Majesty, ‘who, thank God, was better today’. And each visitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening."
"— Вы меня помните? — спокойно, с приятной улыбкой сказал Борис. — Я с матушкой приехал к графу, но он, кажется, не совсем здоров.","- You remember me? Boris said calmly, with a pleasant smile. - I came with my mother to the count, but it seems that he is not completely healthy.","“Do you remember me?” Boris said quietly, with a pleasant smile. “I've come to see the count with my mother, but it seems he's not entirely well.”","‘Do you remember me?’ asked Boris quietly with a pleasant smile. ‘I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not well.’"

"Тон ее уже был ворчливый, губка поднялась, придавая лицу не радостное, а зверское, беличье выраженье. Она замолчала, как будто находя неприличным говорить при Пьере про свою беременность, тогда как в этом и состояла сущность дела.","Her tone was already grouchy, her lip rose, giving her face not a joyful, but a brutal, squirrel-like expression. She fell silent, as if finding it indecent to talk about her pregnancy in front of Pierre, while this was the essence of the matter.","Her tone was querulous now, her little lip rose, giving her face not a joyful but an animalish, squirrel-like expression. She fell silent, as if finding it indecent to speak of her pregnancy in front of Pierre, though that was where the essence of the matter lay.","Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the gist of the matter lay in that."
"«Солдаты! Русская армия выходит против вас, чтобы отмстить за австрийскую, ульмскую армию.

Позиции, которые мы занимаем, — могущественны, и пока они будут итти, чтоб обойти меня справа, они выставят мне фланг! Солдаты! Я сам буду руководить вашими баталионами. Я буду держаться далеко от огня, если вы, с вашей обычной храбростью, внесете в ряды неприятельские беспорядок и смятение; но если победа будет хоть одну минуту сомнительна, вы увидите вашего императора, подвергающегося первым ударам неприятеля, потому что не может быть колебания в победе, особенно в тот день, в который идет речь о чести французской пехоты, которая так необходима для чести своей нации.","""Soldiers!

I will keep far from the fire if you, with your usual courage, bring disorder and confusion into the ranks of the enemy; but if victory is even for a moment in doubt, you will see your emperor exposed to the first blows of the enemy, because there can be no hesitation in victory, especially on a day when the honor of the French infantry, which is so necessary for the honor of his nation, is at issue.","Soldiers!

"— Mais, mon prince, [Но, князь, ] — говорила Анна Михайловна, — после такого великого таинства дайте ему минуту покоя. Вот, Пьер, скажите ваше мнение, — обратилась она к молодому человеку, который, вплоть подойдя к ним, удивленно смотрел на озлобленное, потерявшее всё приличие лицо княжны и на перепрыгивающие щеки князя Василья.","- Mais, mon prince, [But, prince,] - Anna Mikhailovna said, - after such a great sacrament, give him a moment of peace.

"— И скоро она родит? — и, с упреком покачав головой, сказал: — Нехорошо! Продолжай, продолжай.","- And soon she will give birth? and, shaking his head reproachfully, he said: “Not good!

"Но это была она в новом, незнакомом еще ему, сшитом без него платье. Все оставили его, и он побежал к ней. Когда они сошлись, она упала на его грудь рыдая.

"Больного так обступили доктора, княжны и слуги, что Пьер уже не видал той красно-желтой головы с седою гривой, которая, несмотря на то, что он видел и другие лица, ни на мгновение не выходила у него из вида во всё время службы.

"Пьер снял очки, и глаза его сверх той общей странности глаз людей, снявших очки, глаза его смотрели испуганно-вопросительно. Он хотел нагнуться над ее рукой и поцеловать ее; но она быстрым и грубым движеньем головы пeрехватила его губы и свела их с своими.

"Впереди произошло столкновение между австрийским колонновожатым и русским генералом. Русский генерал кричал, требуя, чтобы остановлена была конница; австриец доказывал, что виноват был не он, а высшее начальство. Войска между тем стояли, скучая и падая духом. После часовой задержки войска двинулись, наконец, дальше и стали спускаться под гору. Туман, расходившийся на горе, только гуще расстилался в низах, куда спустились войска. Впереди, в тумане, раздался один, другой выстрел, сначала нескладно в разных промежутках: тратта… тат, и потом всё складнее и чаще, и завязалось дело над речкою Гольдбахом.

Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having stumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their commanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks, and above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily, and advanced and again halted, receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments. In this way the action began for the first, second, and third columns, which had gone down into the valley. The fourth column, where Kutuzov was, stood on the Pratzen heights."
"— Bonsoir, Lise, [Доброй ночи, Лиза, ] — сказал князь Андрей, вставая и учтиво, как у посторонней, целуя руку.","- Bonsoir, Lise, [Good night, Liza,] - said Prince Andrei, getting up and politely, like a stranger, kissing his hand.","“Bonsoir, Lise,”[76] said Prince Andrei, standing up and kissing her hand politely, as if she were a stranger.","‘Bon soir, Lise,’ said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger."
"Он погонял уставшую уже лошадь, чтобы скорее проехать эти толпы, но чем дальше он подвигался, тем толпы становились расстроеннее. По большой дороге, на которую он выехал, толпились коляски, экипажи всех сортов, русские и австрийские солдаты, всех родов войск, раненые и нераненые. Всё это гудело и смешанно копошилось под мрачный звук летавших ядер с французских батарей, поставленных на Праценских высотах.","He urged on his already tired horse in order to quickly pass these crowds, but the farther he moved, the more upset the crowds became. On the high road, on which he left, carriages, carriages of all kinds, Russian and Austrian soldiers, of all branches of the military, wounded and unwounded, crowded. All this buzzed and swarmed mixedly to the gloomy sound of flying cannonballs from the French batteries placed on the Pracen Heights.","He urged on his already tired horse so as to get quickly past these crowds, but the further he went, the more disorderly the crowds became.

"Поставив бутылку на подоконник, чтобы было удобно достать ее, Долохов осторожно и тихо полез в окно. Спустив ноги и расперевшись обеими руками в края окна, он примерился, уселся, опустил руки, подвинулся направо, налево и достал бутылку. Анатоль принес две свечки и поставил их на подоконник, хотя было уже совсем светло. Спина Долохова в белой рубашке и курчавая голова его были освещены с обеих сторон. Все столпились у окна. Англичанин стоял впереди. Пьер улыбался и ничего не говорил.

Anatole brought two candles and put them on the windowsill, although it was already quite light. Dolokhov's back in a white shirt and his curly head were illuminated from both sides.

"— Ведь мы не на Царицыном лугу, Михаил Ларионович, где не начинают парада, пока не придут все полки, — сказал государь, снова взглянув в глаза императору Францу, как бы приглашая его, если не принять участие, то прислушаться к тому, что он говорит; но император Франц, продолжая оглядываться, не слушал.","“After all, we are not in the Tsaritsyn Meadow, Mikhail Larionovich, where they don’t start the parade until all the regiments arrive,” said the sovereign, again looking into the eyes of Emperor Franz, as if inviting him, if not to take part, then listen to what he is talking; but Emperor Franz, continuing to look around, did not listen.","“We're not on the Tsaritsyn Field,[82] Mikhail Larionovich, where you don't start a parade until all the regiments are assembled,” said the sovereign, again glancing into the eyes of the emperor Franz, as though inviting him, if not to take part, at least to listen to what he was saying; but the emperor Franz went on looking around and did not listen.","‘You know, Mikhail Ilarionovich, we are not on the Tsaritsyn Field where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled,’ said the Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying.

"— Извините, генерал, — перебил его Кутузов и тоже поворотился к князю Андрею. — Вот что, мой любезный, возьми ты все донесения от наших лазутчиков у Козловского.

"Полковой командир обратился к князю Багратиону, упрашивая его отъехать назад, так как здесь было слишком опасно. «Помилуйте, ваше сиятельство, ради Бога!» говорил он, за подтверждением взглядывая на свитского офицера, который отвертывался от него. «Вот, изволите видеть!» Он давал заметить пули, которые беспрестанно визжали, пели и свистали около них. Он говорил таким тоном просьбы и упрека, с каким плотник говорит взявшемуся за топор барину: «наше дело привычное, а вы ручки намозолите». Он говорил так, как будто его самого не могли убить эти пули, и его полузакрытые глаза придавали его словам еще более убедительное выражение. Штаб-офицер присоединился к увещаниям полкового командира; но князь Багратион не отвечал им и только приказал перестать стрелять и построиться так, чтобы дать место подходившим двум баталионам. В то время как он говорил, будто невидимою рукой потянулся справа налево, от поднявшегося ветра, полог дыма, скрывавший лощину, и противоположная гора с двигающимися по ней французами открылась перед ними. Все глаза были невольно устремлены на эту французскую колонну, подвигавшуюся к нам и извивавшуюся по уступам местности. Уже видны были мохнатые шапки солдат; уже можно было отличить офицеров от рядовых; видно было, как трепалось о древко их знамя.","The regimental commander turned to Prince Bagration, begging him to drive back, as it was too dangerous here. ""Have mercy, your Excellency, for God's sake!"" he said, looking for confirmation at the retinue officer, who was turning away from him. ""Here, if you please, see!"" He let them see the bullets, which incessantly squealed, sang and whistled around them. He spoke in such a tone of request and reproach, with which a carpenter says to a master holding an ax: “Our business is familiar, but you will get your hands wet.” He spoke as if he himself could not be killed by these bullets, and his half-closed eyes made his words even more convincing. The staff officer joined in the exhortations of the regimental commander; but Prince Bagration did not answer them and only ordered them to stop firing and line up in such a way as to make room for the two battalions that were approaching. While he was talking, as if by an invisible hand stretched from right to left, from the rising wind, a canopy of smoke that hid the hollow, and the opposite mountain with the French moving along it opened up before them. All eyes were involuntarily fixed on this French column, moving towards us and meandering along the ledges of the terrain. The furry hats of the soldiers were already visible; it was already possible to distinguish officers from privates; one could see how their banner fluttered on the staff.","The regimental commander turned to Prince Bagration, entreating him to ride back, because here it was too dangerous. “Please, Your Excellency, for God's sake!” he repeated, glancing for confirmation at the officer of the suite, who turned away from him. “There, kindly see!” He drew attention to the bullets that constantly shrieked, sang, and whistled around them. He spoke in the same tone of entreaty and reproach in which a carpenter speaks to a gentleman who has picked up an ax: “We're used to it, but you'll get blisters on your hands.” He spoke as if he himself could not be killed by these bullets, and his half-closed eyes gave his words a still more persuasive expression. The staff officer joined in the regimental commander's admonitions; but Prince Bagration did not respond to them and merely ordered the men to stop shooting and line up so as to make room for the two expected battalions. While he was speaking, the rising wind, as with an invisible hand, drew from right to left the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, and the hill opposite, with the French moving over it, opened out before them. All eyes were involuntarily turned to this French column that was moving towards them, winding down the terraces of the slope. The soldiers' shaggy hats were already visible; one could already distinguish the officers from the men; one could see their standard fluttering against its staff.","The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagration entreating him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were. ‘Please, your Excellency, for God’s sake!’ he kept saying, glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away from him. ‘There, you see!’ and he drew attention to the bullets whistling, singing and hissing continually around them. He spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an axe: ‘We are used to it, but you, sir, will blister your hands.’ He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and his half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words. The staff-officer joined in the colonel’s appeals, but Bagration did not reply; he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to give room for the two approaching battalions. While he was speaking the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising wind, began to move from right to left, as if drawn by an invisible hand, and the hill opposite with the French moving about on it opened out before them. All eyes fastened involuntarily on this French column advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground. Already the soldiers’ shaggy caps were visible, distinguishing the officers from the men, as was the standard flapping against its staff."

"Среди тех ничтожно-мелких, искусственных интересов, которые связывали это общество, попало простое чувство стремления красивых и здоровых молодых мужчины и женщины друг к другу. И это человеческое чувство подавило всё и парило над всем их искусственным лепетом. Шутки были невеселы, новости неинтересны, оживление — очевидно поддельно. Не только они, но лакеи, служившие за столом, казалось, чувствовали то же и забывали порядки службы, заглядываясь на красавицу Элен с ее сияющим лицом и на красное, толстое, счастливое и беспокойное лицо Пьера.

"— Avant tout dites moi, comment vous allez, chere amie?

"Чем далее подвигался он вперед, ближе к неприятелю, тем порядочнее и веселее становился вид войск. Самый сильный беспорядок и уныние были в том обозе перед Цнаймом, который объезжал утром князь Андрей и который был в десяти верстах от французов. В Грунте тоже чувствовалась некоторая тревога и страх чего-то. Но чем ближе подъезжал князь Андрей к цепи французов, тем самоувереннее становился вид наших войск. Выстроенные в ряд, стояли в шинелях солдаты, и фельдфебель и ротный рассчитывали людей, тыкая пальцем в грудь крайнему по отделению солдату и приказывая ему поднимать руку; рассыпанные по всему пространству, солдаты тащили дрова и хворост и строили балаганчики, весело смеясь и переговариваясь; у костров сидели одетые и голые, суша рубахи, подвертки или починивая сапоги и шинели, толпились около котлов и кашеваров. В одной роте обед был готов, и солдаты с жадными лицами смотрели на дымившиеся котлы и ждали пробы, которую в деревянной чашке подносил каптенармус офицеру, сидевшему на бревне против своего балагана. В другой, более счастливой роте, так как не у всех была водка, солдаты, толпясь, стояли около рябого широкоплечего фельдфебеля, который, нагибая бочонок, лил в подставляемые поочередно крышки манерок. Солдаты с набожными лицами подносили ко рту манерки, опрокидывали их и, полоща рот и утираясь рукавами шинелей, с повеселевшими лицами отходили от фельдфебеля. Все лица были такие спокойные, как будто всё происходило не в виду неприятеля, перед делом, где должна была остаться на месте, по крайней мере, половина отряда, а как будто где-нибудь на родине в ожидании спокойной стоянки. Проехав егерский полк, в рядах киевских гренадеров, молодцоватых людей, занятых теми же мирными делами, князь Андрей недалеко от высокого, отличавшегося от других балагана полкового командира, наехал на фронт взвода гренадер, перед которыми лежал обнаженный человек. Двое солдат держали его, а двое взмахивали гибкие прутья и мерно ударяли по обнаженной спине. Наказываемый неестественно кричал. Толстый майор ходил перед фронтом и, не переставая и не обращая внимания на крик, говорил:","The further he moved forward, closer to the enemy, the more decent and cheerful the appearance of the troops became. The strongest confusion and despondency were in that wagon train in front of Znaim, which Prince Andrei circled in the morning and which was ten miles from the French. Grunt also felt some anxiety and fear of something. But the closer Prince Andrei drove up to the chain of the French, the more self-confident the appearance of our troops became. Lined up in a row, soldiers in overcoats stood, and the sergeant major and the company commander counted people, poking a finger in the chest of the last soldier in the squad and ordering him to raise his hand; scattered throughout the space, the soldiers dragged firewood and brushwood and built booths, laughing merrily and talking to each other; clothed and naked sat by the fires, drying their shirts, undershirts, or mending boots and overcoats, crowding around the boilers and cookers. Dinner was ready in one company, and the soldiers with greedy faces looked at the smoking cauldrons and waited for the sample, which the captain of the army officer, who was sitting on a log opposite his booth, brought in a wooden cup. In another, happier company, since not everyone had vodka, the soldiers, crowding, stood near a pock-marked, broad-shouldered sergeant major, who, bending a keg, poured into the lids of the manners, which were alternately substituted. The soldiers, with pious faces, brought the manners to their mouths, knocked them over, and, rinsing their mouths and wiping themselves with the sleeves of their overcoats, with cheerful faces, moved away from the sergeant major. All the faces were so calm, as if everything was happening not in the mind of the enemy, before the case, where at least half of the detachment was supposed to remain in place, but as if somewhere in their homeland, waiting for a quiet stop. Having passed the chasseur regiment, in the ranks of the Kiev grenadiers, valiant people engaged in the same peaceful affairs, Prince Andrey, not far from the regimental commander's tall, different booth, ran into the front of a platoon of grenadiers, in front of which lay a naked man. Two soldiers held him, and two waved flexible rods and rhythmically hit his bare back. The punished man screamed unnaturally. The fat major walked in front of the front and, without ceasing and paying no attention to the cry, said:","The further ahead he moved, the closer to the enemy, the more orderly and cheerful the troops looked. The greatest disorder and despondency had been in that baggage train before Znaim, which Prince Andrei had circled around in the morning, and which was some seven miles away from the French. In Grunt there was also a feeling of a certain alarm and fear of something. But the closer Prince Andrei rode to the French line, the more self-assured our troops looked. Lined up in ranks, the soldiers stood in their greatcoats, and a sergeant major and a company commander counted heads, jabbing a finger towards the last soldier in the row and ordering him to raise his hand; scattered all over the area, soldiers were carrying firewood and brushwood and building little lean-tos, laughing merrily and talking among themselves; some sat by the campfires, dressed or naked, drying their shirts and foot cloths, or mending boots and greatcoats, crowding around the cauldrons and cooks. In one company, dinner was ready, and the soldiers looked greedily at the steaming cauldrons, waiting until an officer who was sitting on a log facing his lean-to had tried the kasha brought to him in a wooden bowl by a quartermaster sergeant. In another, more fortunate company, since not all of them had vodka, soldiers crowded around a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major, who, tipping a keg, poured into the canteen caps that the soldiers held out in turn. The soldiers, with pious faces, brought the caps to their mouths, upended them, and, rinsing their mouths and wiping them on their greatcoat sleeves, walked away from the sergeant major with cheered faces. All the faces were as calm as though everything was happening not in view of the enemy, prior to an action in which at least half the division would be left on the field, but somewhere in their home country, in expectation of a peaceful stay. Having passed the regiment of chasseurs, and through the lines of the Kievsky grenadiers— brave folk, occupied with the same peaceful affairs—Prince Andrei drew near the tall lean-to, unlike the others, of the regimental commander, and came out to a lined-up platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a stripped man. Two soldiers were holding him, and two, swinging supple switches, were beating him rhythmically on his stripped back. The punished man was crying out unnaturally. A fat major walked in front of the line and, paying no attention to the cries, ceaselessly repeated:","The farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and cheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage-train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven miles away from the French. At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrei came to the French lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops. The soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeant-majors and company officers were counting the men, poking the last man in each section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter; around the fires sat others, dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg-bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge-cookers. In one company dinner was ready and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler, waiting until the sample, which a quartermaster-sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter, had been tasted. Another company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka, crowded around a pock-marked, broad-shouldered sergeant-major who, tilting a keg, filled one after another the canteen-lids held out to him. The soldiers lifted the canteen-lids to their lips with reverential faces, emptied them rolling the vodka in their mouths, and walked away from the sergeant-major with brightened expressions, licking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats. All their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment, and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be left on the field. After passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev grenadiers—fine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs—near the shelter of the regimental commander, higher than and different from the others, Prince Andrei came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man. Two soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare back. The man shrieked unnaturally. A stout major was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the screams kept repeating:"
Тут он не мог уже более держаться и стал отрывисто смеяться и сквозь этот смех проговорил:,"Here he could no longer hold on and began to laugh abruptly, and through this laughter he said:","Here he could no longer control himself and began laughing fitfully, saying through his laughter:","The girl lost her hat and her long hair came down …’ Here he could contain himself no longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: ‘And the whole world knew …’"
— Вы влюблены в меня? — перебила его Наташа.,- Are you in love with me? Natasha interrupted him.,“You're in love with me?” Natasha interrupted.,‘You are in love with me?’ Natasha broke in.
"— Всё-таки я не понял, de quoi vous avez peur, [Чего ты боишься, ] — медлительно проговорил князь Андрей, не спуская глаз с жены.","“Still, I don’t understand, de quoi vous avez peur, [What are you afraid of],” said Prince Andrei slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.","“I still haven't understood de quoi vous avez peur,”[74] Prince Andrei said slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.","‘I still can’t understand de quoi vous avez peur,’3 said Prince Andrei slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife."
"— Ваше благородие, генералы! — сказал унтер-офицер, подъезжая к Ростову.","Your honor, generals! - said the non-commissioned officer, driving up to Rostov.","“The generals, Your Honor!” said the sergeant, riding up to Rostov.","‘Your honour, the generals!’ said the sergeant, riding up to Rostov."
"Преследуемая стотысячною французскою армией под начальством Бонапарта, встречаемая враждебно-расположенными жителями, не доверяя более своим союзникам, испытывая недостаток продовольствия и принужденная действовать вне всех предвидимых условий войны, русская тридцатипятитысячная армия, под начальством Кутузова, поспешно отступала вниз по Дунаю, останавливаясь там, где она бывала настигнута неприятелем, и отбиваясь ариергардными делами, лишь насколько это было нужно для того, чтоб отступать, не теряя тяжестей. Были дела при Ламбахе, Амштетене и Мельке; но, несмотря на храбрость и стойкость, признаваемую самим неприятелем, с которою дрались русские, последствием этих дел было только еще быстрейшее отступление. Австрийские войска, избежавшие плена под Ульмом и присоединившиеся к Кутузову у Браунау, отделились теперь от русской армии, и Кутузов был предоставлен только своим слабым, истощенным силам. Защищать более Вену нельзя было и думать. Вместо наступательной, глубоко обдуманной, по законам новой науки — стратегии, войны, план которой был передан Кутузову в его бытность в Вене австрийским гофкригсратом, единственная, почти недостижимая цель, представлявшаяся теперь Кутузову, состояла в том, чтобы, не погубив армии подобно Маку под Ульмом, соединиться с войсками, шедшими из России.","Pursued by a 100,000-strong French army under Bonaparte, met by hostile residents, no longer trusting their allies, lacking food and forced to act outside all foreseeable conditions of war, the Russian army of 35,000, under the command of Kutuzov, hastily retreated down the Danube, stopping where she was overtaken by the enemy, and fighting back with rearguard affairs, only as much as was necessary in order to retreat without losing weight. There were cases under Lambach, Amstetten and Melk; but, despite the courage and steadfastness, recognized by the enemy himself, with which the Russians fought, the consequence of these deeds was only an even faster retreat. The Austrian troops, who had escaped capture at Ulm and joined Kutuzov at Braunau, now separated from the Russian army, and Kutuzov was left only to his weak, exhausted forces. It was impossible to think of defending Vienna any longer. Instead of an offensive, deeply thought-out, according to the laws of the new science - strategy, war, the plan of which was transferred to Kutuzov when he was in Vienna as an Austrian gofkriegsrat, the only, almost unattainable goal that now seemed to Kutuzov was that, without destroying the army like Mack under Ulm, to connect with the troops marching from Russia.","Pursued by the hundred-thousand-man French army under the leadership of Bonaparte, encountering a hostile local populace, no longer trusting their allies, suffering from a shortness of supplies, and forced to act outside all foreseeable conditions of war, the thirty-five-thousand-man Russian army, under the leadership of Kutuzov, hastily retreated down the Danube, stopping whenever the enemy caught up with it and fighting rear-guard actions, only insofar as it was necessary in order to retreat without loss of heavy equipment. There was action at Lambach, Amstetten, and Molk;[59] but despite the courage and steadfastness, acknowledged by the enemy themselves, with which the Russians fought, the result of these actions was only a still speedier retreat. The Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and joined Kutuzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and Kutuzov was left with nothing but his own weak, exhausted forces. To defend Vienna was no longer thinkable. Instead of the offensive war, profoundly thought out according to the laws of the new science of strategy, the plan of which had been given to Kutuzov while in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole, almost unattainable goal now remaining for Kutuzov was to unite with the troops coming from Russia without losing his own army, as Mack had done at Ulm.","PURSUED by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command of Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly to it, losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies, and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded by Kutuzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube, stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment. There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Mölk; but despite the courage and endurance—acknowledged even by the enemy—with which the Russians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat. Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had joined Kutuzov at Braunau, now separated from the Russian army, and Kutuzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces. The defence of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. Instead of an offensive, the plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics, had been handed to Kutuzov when he was in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from Russia, without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm."

"Генерал, принимая приглашение полковника на турнир храбрости, выпрямив грудь и нахмурившись, поехал с ним вместе по направлению к цепи, как будто всё их разногласие должно было решиться там, в цепи, под пулями. Они приехали в цепь, несколько пуль пролетело над ними, и они молча остановились. Смотреть в цепи нечего было, так как и с того места, на котором они прежде стояли, ясно было, что по кустам и оврагам кавалерии действовать невозможно, и что французы обходят левое крыло. Генерал и полковник строго и значительно смотрели, как два петуха, готовящиеся к бою, друг на друга, напрасно выжидая признаков трусости. Оба выдержали экзамен. Так как говорить было нечего, и ни тому, ни другому не хотелось подать повод другому сказать, что он первый выехал из-под пуль, они долго простояли бы там, взаимно испытывая храбрость, ежели бы в это время в лесу, почти сзади их, не послышались трескотня ружей и глухой сливающийся крик. Французы напали на солдат, находившихся в лесу с дровами. Гусарам уже нельзя было отступать вместе с пехотой. Они были отрезаны от пути отступления налево французскою цепью. Теперь, как ни неудобна была местность, необходимо было атаковать, чтобы проложить себе дорогу.","The general, accepting the colonel's invitation to the tournament of courage, straightening his chest and frowning, rode with him in the direction of the chain, as if all their disagreement was to be decided there, in the chain, under the bullets. They arrived at the chain, several bullets flew over them, and they silently stopped. There was nothing to see in the chain, since even from the place where they had previously stood, it was clear that it was impossible for the cavalry to operate through the bushes and ravines, and that the French were bypassing the left wing. The general and the colonel looked sternly and significantly as the two roosters, preparing for battle, looked at each other, waiting in vain for signs of cowardice. Both passed the test. Since there was nothing to say, and neither one nor the other wanted to give a reason to the other to say that he was the first to leave from under the bullets, they would have stood there for a long time, mutually experiencing courage, if at that time in the forest, almost behind them, the rattle of guns and the muffled merging cry were not heard. The French attacked the soldiers who were in the forest with firewood. The hussars could no longer retreat with the infantry. They were cut off from the retreat to the left by the French line. Now, however inconvenient the terrain was, it was necessary to attack in order to make their way.","The general, accepting the colonel's invitation to a tournament of courage, drew himself up and, frowning, rode with him in the direction of the front, as if all their differences had to be resolved there, at the front, amidst the bullets. They reached the front, several bullets flew over them, and they stopped in silence. There was nothing to look at there, because even from the place where they had been standing before, it had been clear that cavalry could not operate in the bushes and ravines, and that the French were turning their left wing. The general and the colonel stared sternly and significantly at each other, like two cocks preparing to fight, vainly waiting for signs of cowardice. Both passed the examination. Since there was nothing to say, and neither of them wanted to give the other a pretext for claiming he had been the first to run away from the bullets, they would have stood there for a long time, testing each other's courage, if at that moment, in the woods, almost behind them, there had not come a crackle of musket fire and a muffled, merging cry. The French had attacked the soldiers who had gone there for firewood. The hussars could no longer retreat together with the infantry. They were cut off from the path of retreat to the left by the French line. Now, however inconvenient the terrain was, it was necessary to attack in order to cut a path for themselves.","Taking the colonel’s outburst as a challenge to his courage, the general expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the front line, as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets. They reached the front, several bullets sped over them, and they halted in silence. There was nothing fresh to be seen from the line, for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground, as well as that the French were outflanking our left. The general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting-cocks preparing for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other. Both passed the examination successfully. As there was nothing to be said, and neither wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire, they would have remained there for a long time testing each other’s courage, had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood. The French had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse. It was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry. They were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the French. However inconvenient the position, it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through for themselves."

"Пржебышевский с почтительной, но достойной учтивостью пригнул рукой ухо к Вейротеру, имея вид человека, поглощенного вниманием.

"Младшая, румяная и смешливая княжна Софи, с родинкою, смотрела на него. Она улыбнулась, спрятала свое лицо в платок и долго не открывала его; но, посмотрев на Пьера, опять засмеялась. Она, видимо, чувствовала себя не в силах глядеть на него без смеха, но не могла удержаться, чтобы не смотреть на него, и во избежание искушений тихо перешла за колонну. В середине службы голоса духовенства вдруг замолкли; духовные лица шопотом сказали что-то друг другу; старый слуга, державший руку графа, поднялся и обратился к дамам. Анна Михайловна выступила вперед и, нагнувшись над больным, из-за спины пальцем поманила к себе Лоррена. Француз-доктор, — стоявший без зажженной свечи, прислонившись к колонне, в той почтительной позе иностранца, которая показывает, что, несмотря на различие веры, он понимает всю важность совершающегося обряда и даже одобряет его, — неслышными шагами человека во всей силе возраста подошел к больному, взял своими белыми тонкими пальцами его свободную руку с зеленого одеяла и, отвернувшись, стал щупать пульс и задумался. Больному дали чего-то выпить, зашевелились около него, потом опять расступились по местам, и богослужение возобновилось. Во время этого перерыва Пьер заметил, что князь Василий вышел из-за своей спинки стула и, с тем же видом, который показывал, что он знает, что делает, и что тем хуже для других, ежели они не понимают его, не подошел к больному, а, пройдя мимо его, присоединился к старшей княжне и с нею вместе направился в глубь спальни, к высокой кровати под шелковыми занавесами. От кровати и князь и княжна оба скрылись в заднюю дверь, но перед концом службы один за другим возвратились на свои места. Пьер обратил на это обстоятельство не более внимания, как и на все другие, раз навсегда решив в своем уме, что всё, что совершалось перед ним нынешний вечер, было так необходимо нужно.","The youngest, ruddy and humorous Princess Sophie, with a mole, looked at him. She smiled, hid her face in a handkerchief, and did not open it for a long time; but, looking at Pierre, she laughed again. She apparently felt unable to look at him without laughing, but she could not help but look at him, and in order to avoid temptations she quietly crossed behind the column. In the middle of the service, the voices of the clergy suddenly fell silent; the clergy said something to each other in a whisper; the old servant who held the earl's hand rose and addressed the ladies. Anna Mikhaylovna stepped forward and, bending over the sick man, beckoned Lorrain to her from behind with her finger. The French doctor, standing without a lighted candle, leaning against a column, in that respectful pose of a foreigner, which shows that, despite the difference in faith, he understands the full importance of the rite being performed and even approves of it, approached with the inaudible steps of a man in all the strength of age. to the patient, took his free hand from the green blanket with his white thin fingers and, turning away, began to feel the pulse and thought. They gave the sick man something to drink, stirred about him, then again parted to their places, and the service resumed. During this break, Pierre noticed that Prince Vasily stepped out from behind his chair and, with the same air that showed that he knew what he was doing, and that it was all the worse for others if they did not understand him, did not go up to sick, and, passing him, joined the eldest princess and together with her went into the depths of the bedroom, to a high bed under silk curtains. From the bed, both the prince and princess both disappeared through the back door, but before the end of the service, one by one returned to their places. Pierre paid no more attention to this circumstance than to all the others, deciding once and for all in his mind that everything that happened before him that evening was so necessary.","The youngest, the red-cheeked and laughter-prone Princess Sophie, with the little mole, looked at him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and did not uncover it for a long time; but, looking at Pierre, she laughed again. She evidently felt herself unable to look at him without laughing, but could not keep from looking at him, and, to avoid temptation, slowly moved behind a column. Midway through the service, the voices of the clergy suddenly fell silent; the clerical persons said something to each other in a whisper; the old servant who was holding the count's hand straightened up and turned to the ladies. Anna Mikhailovna stepped forward and, bending over the sick man, beckoned behind her back for Lorrain to come. The French doctor—who stood without a lighted candle, leaning on a column, in the respectful pose of a foreigner, which showed that, despite differences of belief, he understood all the importance of the rite being performed and even approved of it—went over to the sick man with the inaudible steps of a man in the prime of life, took up his free hand from the green coverlet in his white, slender fingers, and, turning away, began taking his pulse and pondering. The sick man was given something to drink, there was stirring around him, then everyone went to their places and the service resumed. During this interruption, Pierre noticed that Prince Vassily came from behind the back of his chair and with that same look which showed that he knew what he was doing, and so much the worse for the others if they did not understand him, did not go up to the sick man, but passing by him, joined the eldest princess and together with her made for the depths of the bedroom, to the high bed under the silk canopy. From the bed, both prince and princess disappeared through a rear door, but before the end of the service they came back to their places one after the other. Pierre paid no more attention to this circumstance than to all the others, having decided in his mind once and for all that everything taking place before him that evening had necessarily to be so.","Sophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole, watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained with it hidden for a while; then looking up and seeing Pierre she again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing, but could not resist looking at him; so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered to one another, and the old servant who was holding the count’s hand got up and said something to the ladies. Anna Mikhailovna stepped forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from behind her back. The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he, a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it. He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigour of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment. The sick man was given something to drink, there was a stir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service continued. During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasili left the chair on which he had been leaning, and—with an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them—did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince Vasili and the princess passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential."

С этою целью он и хотел выехать навстречу полку, так что, чем хуже было бы положение полка, тем приятнее было бы это главнокомандующему.

"— Не шучу, — продолжал Билибин, — ничего нет справедливее и печальнее. Господа эти приезжают на мост одни и поднимают белые платки; уверяют, что перемирие, и что они, маршалы, едут для переговоров с князем Ауэрспергом. Дежурный офицер пускает их в tete de pont. [мостовое укрепление. ] Они рассказывают ему тысячу гасконских глупостей: говорят, что война кончена, что император Франц назначил свидание Бонапарту, что они желают видеть князя Ауэрсперга, и тысячу гасконад и проч. Офицер посылает за Ауэрспергом; господа эти обнимают офицеров, шутят, садятся на пушки, а между тем французский баталион незамеченный входит на мост, сбрасывает мешки с горючими веществами в воду и подходит к tete de pont. Наконец, является сам генерал-лейтенант, наш милый князь Ауэрсперг фон-Маутерн. «Милый неприятель! Цвет австрийского воинства, герой турецких войн! Вражда кончена, мы можем подать друг другу руку… император Наполеон сгорает желанием узнать князя Ауэрсперга». Одним словом, эти господа, не даром гасконцы, так забрасывают Ауэрсперга прекрасными словами, он так прельщен своею столь быстро установившеюся интимностью с французскими маршалами, так ослеплен видом мантии и страусовых перьев Мюрата, qu'il n'y voit que du feu, et oubl celui qu'il devait faire faire sur l'ennemi. [Что он видит только их огонь и забывает о своем, о том, который он обязан был открыть против неприятеля. ] (Несмотря на живость своей речи, Билибин не забыл приостановиться после этого mot, чтобы дать время оценить его.) Французский баталион вбегает в tete de pont, заколачивают пушки, и мост взят. Нет, но что лучше всего, — продолжал он, успокоиваясь в своем волнении прелестью собственного рассказа, — это то, что сержант, приставленный к той пушке, по сигналу которой должно было зажигать мины и взрывать мост, сержант этот, увидав, что французские войска бегут на мост, хотел уже стрелять, но Ланн отвел его руку. Сержант, который, видно, был умнее своего генерала, подходит к Ауэрспергу и говорит: «Князь, вас обманывают, вот французы!» Мюрат видит, что дело проиграно, ежели дать говорить сержанту. Он с удивлением (настоящий гасконец) обращается к Ауэрспергу: «Я не узнаю столь хваленую в мире австрийскую дисциплину, — говорит он, — и вы позволяете так говорить с вами низшему чину!» C'est genial. Le prince d'Auersperg se pique d'honneur et fait mettre le sergent aux arrets. Non, mais avouez que c'est charmant toute cette histoire du pont de Thabor. Ce n'est ni betise, ni lachete… [Это гениально. Князь Ауэрсперг оскорбляется и приказывает арестовать сержанта. Нет, признайтесь, что это прелесть, вся эта история с мостом. Это не то что глупость, не то что подлость…]","“I’m not kidding,” Bilibin continued, “there is nothing fairer and sadder. These gentlemen come to the bridge alone and raise their white handkerchiefs; they assure that there is a truce, and that they, the marshals, are going to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. The duty officer lets them into the tete de pont. [bridge fortification. ] They tell him a thousand Gascon nonsense: they say that the war is over, that the Emperor Franz has made an appointment with Bonaparte, that they want to see Prince Auersperg, and a thousand Gasconades, and so on. The officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, joke, sit on their guns, and meanwhile the French battalion enters the bridge unnoticed, dumps bags of combustible substances into the water and approaches the tete de pont. Finally, the Lieutenant General himself, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern, appears. ""Dear enemy! The color of the Austrian army, the hero of the Turkish wars! The enmity is over, we can give each other a hand ... Emperor Napoleon is burning with a desire to know Prince Auersperg. In a word, these gentlemen, not for nothing the Gascons, so pelt Auersperg with beautiful words, he is so seduced by his so quickly established intimacy with the French marshals, so blinded by the sight of Murat's mantle and ostrich feathers, qu'il n'y voit que du feu, et oubl celui qu'il devait faire faire sur l'ennemi. [That he sees only their fire and forgets about his own, about the one he was obliged to open against the enemy. ] (Despite the liveliness of his speech, Bilibin did not forget to pause after this mot to give him time to evaluate it.) The French battalion runs into the tete de pont, the cannons are hammered in, and the bridge is taken. No, but what’s best,” he continued, calming down in his excitement at the charm of his own story, “is that the sergeant assigned to that cannon, at the signal of which it was supposed to light the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French troops they were running to the bridge, they were about to shoot, but Lann took his hand away. The sergeant, who apparently was smarter than his general, comes up to Auersperg and says: “Prince, you are being deceived, here are the French!” Murat sees that the case is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak. He turns to Auersperg with surprise (a real Gascon): “I don’t recognize the Austrian discipline so praised in the world,” he says, “and you allow the lowest rank to speak to you like that!” C'est genius. Le prince d'Auersperg se pique d'honneur et fait mettre le sergent aux arrets. Non, mais avouez que c'est charmant toute cette histoire du pont de Thabor. Ce n'est ni betise, ni lachete… [This is brilliant. Prince Auersperg is offended and orders the arrest of the sergeant. No, admit it, it's lovely, this whole story with the bridge. It’s not that stupid, it’s not that mean…]","“I'm not joking,” Bilibin went on, “nothing is more true or sad. These gentlemen come to the bridge by themselves and wave white handkerchiefs; assure them all that a truce has been called and that they, the marshals, are coming to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. The officer on duty lets them into the tête de pont. They tell him a thousand Gascon absurdities: that the war is over, that the emperor Franz has fixed a meeting with Bonaparte, that they wish to see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, joke, sit on the cannons, and meanwhile a French battalion gets onto the bridge unnoticed, throws the sacks of flammable material into the water, and approaches the tête de pont. Finally, the lieutenant general himself comes, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern. ' Our dear enemy! Flower of the Austrian military, hero of the Turkish wars! The hostilities are over, we can shake hands with each other ... The emperor Napoleon is burning with desire to meet Prince Auersperg.' In short, these men aren't Gascons for nothing, they so shower Auersperg with beautiful words, he's so charmed by his quickly established intimacy with the French marshals, so dazzled by the sight of Murat's mantle and ostrich feathers, qu'il n'y voit que du feu , et oublie celui qu'il devait faire, faire sur l'ennemi. ” [211] (Despite the animation of his speech, Bilibin did not forget to pause after this mot, to allow time for it to be appreciated.) “The French battalion rushes into the tête de pont, spikes the cannons, and the bridge is taken. No, but the best thing of all,” he went on, his excitement with his own charming story subsiding, “is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon that was to give the signal to ignite the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that French troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes pushed his hand away. The sergeant, who was clearly smarter than his general, goes up to Auersperg and says; 'Prince, you are deceived, the French are here!' Murat sees that the game is up if the sergeant is allowed to speak. With feigned astonishment (a real Gascon), he turns to Auersperg: 'Where is that Austrian discipline the world praises so much,' he says, 'if you allow the lower ranks to speak to you like that.' C'est génial. Le prince Auersperg se pique d'honneur et fait mettre le sergeant aux arrêts. Non, mais avouez que c'est charmant toute cette histoire du pont de Tabor. Ce n'est ni bêtise, ni lâcheté...”[212][68] “C'est trahison peut- être,”[213] said Prince Andrei, vividly imagining gray greatcoats, wounds, gunsmoke, the sounds of shooting, and the glory that awaited him...","‘I am not jesting,’ Bilibin went on. ‘Nothing is truer or sadder. These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs; they assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter the tête-de-pont. They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that the war is over, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved, flings the bags of incendiary material into the water, and approaches the tête-depont. At length appears the lieutenant-general, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself. “Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars! Hostilities are ended, we can shake one another’s hand … The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auersperg’s acquaintance.” In a word those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the sight of Murat’s mantle and ostrich plumes, qu’il n’y voit que du feu, et oublie celui qu’il devait faire, faire sur l’ennemi!’1 In spite of the animation of his speech Bilibin did not forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation. ‘ The French battalion rushes to the tête-de-pont, spikes the guns, and the bridge is taken! But what is best of all,’ he went on, his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, ‘is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant seeing that the French troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes stayed his hand. The sergeant, who was evidently wiser than his general, goes up to Auersperg and says: “Prince, you are being deceived, here are the French!” Murat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a true Gascon) and says: “I don’t recognize the world-famous Austrian discipline, if you allow a subordinate to address you like that!” C’est génial. Le prince d’Auersperg se pique d’honneur et fait mettre le sergent aux arrêts. Non, mais avouez que c’est charmant toute cette histoire du pont de Thabor. Ce n’est ni bêtise, ni lâcheté …’1 ‘C’est trahison, peut-être,’2 said Prince Andrei, vividly imagining the grey overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing, and the glory that awaited him."
"— На завтра! — сказал он, быстро отыскивая страницу и от параграфа до другого отмечая жестким ногтем.","- For tomorrow! he said, quickly looking for a page and marking from paragraph to next with a hard fingernail.","“For tomorrow!” he said, quickly finding the page and marking it paragraph by paragraph with his hard fingernail.","‘For tomorrow!’ said he, quickly finding the page and making a scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail."
"Князь Андрей, для полноты трофея пленников выставленный также вперед, на глаза императору, не мог не привлечь его внимания. Наполеон, видимо, вспомнил, что он видел его на поле и, обращаясь к нему, употребил то самое наименование молодого человека — jeune homme, под которым Болконский в первый раз отразился в его памяти.","Prince Andrey, for the sake of completeness of the trophy of the captives, was also put forward, in front of the emperor, could not help but attract his attention. Napoleon, apparently, remembered that he had seen him on the field and, addressing him, used the very name of the young man - jeune homme, under which Bolkonsky was first reflected in his memory.","Prince Andrei, who, to complete the trophy of prisoners, was also brought out before the eyes of the emperor, could not fail to attract his attention. Napoleon evidently remembered seeing him on the battlefield, and, turning to him, used the same appellation of young man, jeune homme, under which Bolkonsky had been imprinted on his memory the first time.","Prince Andrei, who had also been brought forward before the Emperor’s eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his attention.

"— Урра! Урра! Урра! — гремело со всех сторон, и один полк за другим принимал государя звуками генерал-марша; потом Урра!.. генерал-марш и опять Урра! и Урра!! которые, всё усиливаясь и прибывая, сливались в оглушительный гул.","— Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! - thundered from all sides, and one regiment after another received the sovereign with the sounds of a general march; then Hurrah! .. general march and again Urra! and hooray!! which, growing stronger and stronger, merged into a deafening rumble.","“Hurrah! Hurrah!

"— Ну, вообще как можно больше говорите. Его страсть — аудиенции; а говорить сам он не любит и не умеет, как увидите.","Well, talk as much as you can. His passion is audiences; but he does not like to speak and does not know how, as you will see.","“Well, generally, talk as much as possible. Audiences are his passion; but he neither likes nor is able to talk himself, as you'll see.”","‘Well, talk as much as you can, anyway. He has a passion for giving audiences, but he does not like talking himself and can’t do it, as you will see.’"
"— Это всё хорошо, никто не думает, что вы трус, да не в том дело. Спросите у Денисова, похоже это на что-нибудь, чтобы юнкер требовал удовлетворения у полкового командира?","- That's all right, no one thinks that you are a coward, but that's not the point. Ask Denisov, does it look like something for a cadet to demand satisfaction from a regimental commander?","“That's all well and good, nobody thinks you're a coward, but that's not the point. Ask Denisov what it looks like if a junker demands satisfaction from a regimental commander.”","‘That’s all right. No one thinks you’re a coward, but that’s not the point. Ask Denisov if it’s ever done, that a cadet demands satisfaction from his regimental commander?’"
"Генерал нахмурился. Хотя и не было положительных известий о поражении австрийцев, но было слишком много обстоятельств, подтверждавших общие невыгодные слухи; и потому предположение Кутузова о победе австрийцев было весьма похоже на насмешку. Но Кутузов кротко улыбался, всё с тем же выражением, которое говорило, что он имеет право предполагать это. Действительно, последнее письмо, полученное им из армии Мака, извещало его о победе и о самом выгодном стратегическом положении армии.","The general frowned. Although there was no positive news about the defeat of the Austrians, there were too many circumstances that confirmed the general unfavorable rumors; and therefore Kutuzov's assumption about the victory of the Austrians was very similar to a mockery. But Kutuzov smiled meekly, all with the same expression that said that he had the right to assume this. Indeed, the last letter he received from Mack's army informed him of the victory and the most advantageous strategic position of the army.","The general frowned.

IX,IX,“Word of honor!”,‘On my honour!’
"Всё побежало, заторопилось, и Ростов увидал сзади по дороге несколько подъезжающих всадников с белыми султанами на шляпах. В одну минуту все были на местах и ждали. Ростов не помнил и не чувствовал, как он добежал до своего места и сел на лошадь. Мгновенно прошло его сожаление о неучастии в деле, его будничное расположение духа в кругу приглядевшихся лиц, мгновенно исчезла всякая мысль о себе: он весь поглощен был чувством счастия, происходящего от близости государя. Он чувствовал себя одною этою близостью вознагражденным за потерю нынешнего дня. Он был счастлив, как любовник, дождавшийся ожидаемого свидания. Не смея оглядываться во фронте и не оглядываясь, он чувствовал восторженным чутьем его приближение. И он чувствовал это не по одному звуку копыт лошадей приближавшейся кавалькады, но он чувствовал это потому, что, по мере приближения, всё светлее, радостнее и значительнее и праздничнее делалось вокруг него. Всё ближе и ближе подвигалось это солнце для Ростова, распространяя вокруг себя лучи кроткого и величественного света, и вот он уже чувствует себя захваченным этими лучами, он слышит его голос — этот ласковый, спокойный, величественный и вместе с тем столь простой голос. Как и должно было быть по чувству Ростова, наступила мертвая тишина, и в этой тишине раздались звуки голоса государя.","Everything ran, hurried, and Rostov saw several horsemen with white sultans on their hats driving up along the road. In one minute everyone was in place and waiting. Rostov did not remember and did not feel how he ran to his place and got on his horse. Instantly his regret for non-participation in the case passed, his everyday disposition of the spirit in the circle of looking at faces, all thought of himself instantly disappeared: he was completely absorbed in the feeling of happiness that comes from the closeness of the sovereign. He felt himself rewarded for the loss of this day by this closeness alone. He was happy, like a lover waiting for an expected date. Not daring to look back at the front and not looking back, he felt with an enthusiastic instinct its approach. And he felt this not only from the sound of the hooves of the horses of the approaching cavalcade, but he felt it because, as he approached, everything became brighter, more joyful, more significant and more festive around him. This sun for Rostov moved closer and closer, spreading rays of gentle and majestic light around itself, and now he already feels captured by these rays, he hears his voice - this gentle, calm, majestic and at the same time so simple voice. As it should have been according to Rostov's feelings, there was dead silence, and in this silence the sounds of the sovereign's voice were heard.","Everyone began running, hurrying, and Rostov saw behind him on the road several horsemen with white plumes in their hats riding up. In a single moment, everyone was in his place and waiting. Rostov did not remember and did not feel how he ran to his place and mounted his horse. His regret over his non-participation in the action, his humdrum mood in the circle of usual faces, instantly went away, and all thought of himself instantly vanished: he was wholly consumed by the feeling of happiness that came from the nearness of the sovereign. He felt himself rewarded by this nearness alone for the loss of that day. He was as happy as a lover who has obtained a hoped-for rendezvous. Not daring to turn to look while in line, and not looking, his rapturous senses felt his approach. And he felt it not only from the hoofbeats of the approaching cavalcade, but felt it because as it approached everything around him became brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more festive. This sun moved ever nearer and nearer to Rostov, spreading around itself rays of mild and majestic light, and he already feels himself caught up in those rays, he hears his voice—that gentle, calm, majestic, and at the same time so simple voice. As it had to be, according to Rostov's feeling, a deathly silence ensued, and in that silence the sounds of the sovereign's voice rang out.","All began to run and bustle, and Rostov saw coming up the road behind him several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment everyone was in his place, waiting. Rostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted. Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood amid people of whom he was weary, had gone, instantly every thought of himself had vanished. He was filled with happiness at his nearness to the Emperor. He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the day he had lost. He was happy as a lover when the longed-for moment of meeting arrives. Not daring to look round and without looking round, he was ecstatically conscious of his approach. He felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade, but because as he drew near everything grew brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more festive around him. Nearer and nearer to Rostov came that sun shedding beams of mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself enveloped in those beams, he heard his voice, that kindly, calm, and majestic voice, that was yet so simple! And as if in accord with Rostov’s feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the Emperor’s voice."
"— Вот зачэм, мы лосты вый государ, — заключил он, назидательно выпивая стакан вина и оглядываясь на графа за поощрением.","“Here’s why, we are a worthy sovereign,” he concluded, instructively drinking a glass of wine and looking back at the count for encouragement.","“It's pecause of that, my tear sir,” he concluded didactically, drinking a glass of wine and looking to the count for encouragement.","‘Zat, my dear sir, is vy …’ he concluded, drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval."
"— Еще не ложились? А? как ты думаешь? Смотри же не забудь, тотчас достань мне новую венгерку, — прибавил Ростов, ощупывая новые усы. — Ну же пошел, — кричал он ямщику. — Да проснись же, Вася, — обращался он к Денисову, который опять опустил голову. — Да ну же, пошел, три целковых на водку, пошел! — закричал Ростов, когда уже сани были за три дома от подъезда. Ему казалось, что лошади не двигаются. Наконец сани взяли вправо к подъезду; над головой своей Ростов увидал знакомый карниз с отбитой штукатуркой, крыльцо, тротуарный столб. Он на ходу выскочил из саней и побежал в сени. Дом также стоял неподвижно, нерадушно, как будто ему дела не было до того, кто приехал в него. В сенях никого не было. «Боже мой! все ли благополучно?» подумал Ростов, с замиранием сердца останавливаясь на минуту и тотчас пускаясь бежать дальше по сеням и знакомым, покривившимся ступеням. Всё та же дверная ручка замка, за нечистоту которой сердилась графиня, также слабо отворялась. В передней горела одна сальная свеча.","- Haven't gone to bed yet? A? how do you think? Look, don’t forget, get me a new Hungarian at once, ”added Rostov, feeling his new mustache. “Come on, let’s go,” he shouted to the driver. “Wake up, Vasya,” he turned to Denisov, who lowered his head again. “Come on, let’s go, three rubles for vodka, let’s go!” Rostov shouted when the sleigh was already three houses from the entrance. It seemed to him that the horses were not moving. Finally the sleigh was taken to the right to the entrance; above his head, Rostov saw a familiar cornice with broken plaster, a porch, a sidewalk pillar. He jumped out of the sleigh on the move and ran into the passage. The house also stood motionless, unfriendly, as if it didn't care who came to it. There was no one in the vestibule. ""Oh my God! is everything all right?"" thought Rostov, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and at once starting to run further along the passage and the familiar, twisted steps. The same doorknob of the castle, for the uncleanliness of which the countess was angry, also weakly opened. A single tallow candle burned in the hallway.","“So they're not in bed yet? Eh? What do you think?” “See that you don't forget to take out my new Hungarian jacket for me at once,” Rostov added, feeling his new mustache. “Well, on with you,” he cried to the driver. “Wake up now, Vasya,” he turned to Denisov, who was lowering his head again. “Well, on with you, three roubles for vodka, on with you!” shouted Rostov, when the sleigh was three houses away from their entrance. It seemed to him the horses were not moving. At last the sleigh pulled to the right at the entrance; over his head Rostov saw the familiar cornice with its chipped stucco, the porch, the hitching post. He jumped out of the sleigh while it was still moving and ran into the front hall. The house stood as immobile, unwelcoming, as if it cared nothing for the one who had arrived. There was no one in the hall. “My God! is everything all right?” thought Rostov, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and at once set off running down the hall and up the familiar slanting steps. The same door handle, the dirtiness of which always angered the countess, turned as slackly as ever. One tallow candle was burning in the front room.","‘Then they’ve not gone to bed yet? What do you think? Remember, don’t forget to put out my new coat,’ added Rostov, fingering his new moustache. ‘Now then, get on,’ he shouted to the driver. ‘Do wake up, Vaska,’ he went on, turning to Denisov, whose head was again nodding. ‘Come, get on! You shall have three rubles for vodka—get on!’ Rostov shouted, when the sledge was only three houses from his door. It seemed to him the horses were not moving at all. At last the sledge bore to the right, drew up at an entrance, and Rostov saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster broken off, the porch, and the post by the side of the pavement. He sprang out before the sledge stopped, and ran into the hall. The house stood cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it. There was no one in the hall. ‘ Oh God! Is everyone all right?’ he thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar staircase. The well-known old door-handle, which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned, turned as loosely as ever. A solitary tallow candle burnt in the ante-room."
"— Как случится, — сказал Ростов.","""What will happen,"" said Rostov.","“However it happens,” said Rostov.","‘As may happen,’ said Rostov."
"— На горе пикет, ваше сиятельство, всё там же, где был с вечера, — доложил Ростов, нагибаясь вперед, держа руку у козырька и не в силах удержать улыбку веселья, вызванного в нем его поездкой и, главное, звуками пуль.","“There is a picket on the mountain, Your Excellency, everything is the same as it was in the evening,” Rostov reported, leaning forward, holding his hand at the visor and unable to restrain the smile of fun caused in him by his trip and, most importantly, by the sounds of bullets.","“There are pickets on the hill, Your Excellency, in the same place as this evening,” Rostov reported, bending forward, holding his hand to his visor, and unable to repress a cheerful smile, called up in him by his ride and above all by the whine of the bullets.","‘The picket is still on the hill, your Excellency, just where it was in the evening,’ reported Rostov, stooping forward with his hand at the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride and especially by the sound of the bullets."
"— Что делать? Красива! Я всё сделаю. Ты будь покоен, — говорил он отрывисто во время печатания.","- What to do? Beautiful! I'll do everything. You be calm,” he said curtly while typing.","“What can you do? She's beautiful! I'll do everything. You can rest easy,” he said brusquely while sealing a letter.","‘What’s to be done? She’s pretty! I will do everything. Make your mind easy,’ said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter."

"Государь поровнялся с Ростовым и остановился. Лицо Александра было еще прекраснее, чем на смотру три дня тому назад. Оно сияло такою веселостью и молодостью, такою невинною молодостью, что напоминало ребяческую четырнадцатилетнюю резвость, и вместе с тем это было всё-таки лицо величественного императора. Случайно оглядывая эскадрон, глаза государя встретились с глазами Ростова и не более как на две секунды остановились на них. Понял ли государь, что делалось в душе Ростова (Ростову казалось, что он всё понял), но он посмотрел секунды две своими голубыми глазами в лицо Ростова. (Мягко и кротко лился из них свет.) Потом вдруг он приподнял брови, резким движением ударил левой ногой лошадь и галопом поехал вперед.","The sovereign drew level with Rostov and stopped. Alexander's face was even more beautiful than at the review three days ago. It shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it resembled a childish fourteen-year-old playfulness, and at the same time it was still the face of a majestic emperor. Accidentally looking around the squadron, the eyes of the sovereign met the eyes of Rostov and stopped on them for no more than two seconds. Did the emperor understand what was going on in Rostov's soul (it seemed to Rostov that he understood everything), but for two seconds he looked with his blue eyes into Rostov's face. (Light poured out of them softly and meekly.) Then suddenly he raised his eyebrows, with a sharp movement kicked the horse with his left foot and galloped forward.","The sovereign drew even with Rostov and stopped.

"Она очнулась и ужаснулась тому, о чем она думала. И прежде чем итти вниз, она встала, вошла в образную и, устремив на освещенный лампадой черный лик большого образа Спасителя, простояла перед ним с сложенными несколько минут руками. В душе княжны Марьи было мучительное сомненье. Возможна ли для нее радость любви, земной любви к мужчине? В помышлениях о браке княжне Марье мечталось и семейное счастие, и дети, но главною, сильнейшею и затаенною ее мечтою была любовь земная. Чувство было тем сильнее, чем более она старалась скрывать его от других и даже от самой себя. Боже мой, — говорила она, — как мне подавить в сердце своем эти мысли дьявола? Как мне отказаться так, навсегда от злых помыслов, чтобы спокойно исполнять Твою волю? И едва она сделала этот вопрос, как Бог уже отвечал ей в ее собственном сердце: «Не желай ничего для себя; не ищи, не волнуйся, не завидуй. Будущее людей и твоя судьба должна быть неизвестна тебе; но живи так, чтобы быть готовой ко всему. Если Богу угодно будет испытать тебя в обязанностях брака, будь готова исполнить Его волю». С этой успокоительной мыслью (но всё-таки с надеждой на исполнение своей запрещенной, земной мечты) княжна Марья, вздохнув, перекрестилась и сошла вниз, не думая ни о своем платье, ни о прическе, ни о том, как она войдет и что скажет. Что могло всё это значить в сравнении с предопределением Бога, без воли Которого не падет ни один волос с головы человеческой.","She woke up and was horrified at what she was thinking. And before going downstairs, she got up, entered the figurative and, gazing at the black face of the large image of the Savior illuminated by the lamp, stood in front of him with her hands folded for several minutes. There was an agonizing doubt in Princess Mary's soul. Is it possible for her to enjoy the joy of love, earthly love for a man? In thoughts of marriage, Princess Mary dreamed of both family happiness and children, but her main, strongest and most hidden dream was earthly love. The feeling was the stronger, the more she tried to hide it from others and even from herself. My God, she said, how can I suppress these thoughts of the devil in my heart? How can I renounce evil thoughts forever so that I can calmly do Your will? And as soon as she made this question, God already answered her in her own heart: “Desire nothing for yourself; do not seek, do not worry, do not envy. The future of the people and your fate must be unknown to you; but live so as to be ready for anything. If it pleases God to test you in the duties of marriage, be ready to do His will.” With this soothing thought (but still with the hope of fulfilling her forbidden, earthly dream), Princess Mary, sighing, crossed herself and went downstairs, not thinking about her dress, or her hair, or how she would enter and what she would say. . What could all this mean in comparison with the predestination of God, without whose will not a single hair will fall from a human head.","She roused herself and was horrified at what she had been thinking. And before going downstairs, she stood up, went to her icon room, and, fixing her eyes on the dark lamp-lit face of a large icon of the Savior, stood before it with clasped hands for several minutes. There was tormenting doubt in Princess Marya's soul. Was the joy of love, of earthly love for a man, possible for her? Thinking of marriage, Princess Marya dreamed of family happiness and children, but her chiefest, strongest, and most secret dream was of earthly love. This feeling was all the stronger, the more she tried to conceal it from others and even from herself. “My God,” she said, “how can I suppress these devil's thoughts in my heart? How can I renounce evil imaginings forever, so as peacefully to do Thy will?” And she had barely asked this question, when God answered her in her own heart: “Desire nothing for yourself; do not seek, do not worry, do not envy. The future of people and your own fate must be unknown to you; but live so as to be ready for anything. If God should see fit to test you in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfill His will. “ With this reassuring thought (but still with a hope that her forbidden earthly dream would be fulfilled), Princess Marya sighed, crossed herself, and went downstairs without thinking about her dress, or her hairstyle, or how she would walk in, or what she would say. What could all that mean in comparison with the predestination of God, without whose will not one hair falls from man's head.","She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit up by a lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments. A painful doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Marya dreamed of happiness and of children, but her strongest most deeply-hidden longing was for earthly love. The more she tried to hide this feeling from others and even from herself, the stronger it grew. ‘ O God,’ she said, ‘how am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil? How am I to renounce for ever these vile fancies, so as peacefully to fulfil Thy will?’ And scarcely had she put that question than God gave her the answer in her own heart. ‘Desire nothing for thyself, seek nothing, be not anxious or envious. Man’s future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything. If it be God’s will to prove thee in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfil His will.’ With this consoling thought (but yet with a hope for the fulfilment of her forbidden earthly longing) Princess Marya sighed, and having crossed herself went down, thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say.

"— Поверите ли, граф, я ничего не испугался, потому что я знал, что я прав. Я, знаете, граф, не хвалясь, могу сказать, что я приказы по полку наизусть знаю и устав тоже знаю, как Отче наш на небесех. Поэтому, граф, у меня по роте упущений не бывает. Вот моя совесть и спокойна. Я явился. (Берг привстал и представил в лицах, как он с рукой к козырьку явился. Действительно, трудно было изобразить в лице более почтительности и самодовольства.)

Так-то, граф, — говорил Берг, закуривая трубку и пуская колечки.","“Believe me, count, I was not afraid of anything, because I knew that I was right. You know, Count, without boasting, I can say that I know the orders for the regiment by heart and I also know the charter, like our Father in heaven.

""What, are you dumb, or what?"" he screamed. I keep silent. What do you think, Count? The next day it was not even in the order: that's what it means not to get lost.

' Are you mute, or what?' he shouts. I still say nothing. And what do you think, Count? The next day there was nothing in the orders; that's what it means not to get flustered!

"Из-за детской радости, возбужденной пожаром, и азарта удачной стрельбы по французам, наши артиллеристы заметили эту батарею только тогда, когда два ядра и вслед за ними еще четыре ударили между орудиями и одно повалило двух лошадей, а другое оторвало ногу ящичному вожатому. Оживление, раз установившееся, однако, не ослабело, а только переменило настроение. Лошади были заменены другими из запасного лафета, раненые убраны, и четыре орудия повернуты против десятипушечной батареи. Офицер, товарищ Тушина, был убит в начале дела, и в продолжение часа из сорока человек прислуги выбыли семнадцать, но артиллеристы всё так же были веселы и оживлены. Два раза они замечали, что внизу, близко от них, показывались французы, и тогда они били по них картечью.","Because of the childish joy aroused by the fire, and the excitement of successful shooting at the French, our gunners noticed this battery only when two shots and after them four more hit between the guns and one knocked down two horses, and the other tore off the leg of the box leader.

The horses were replaced by others from the reserve carriage, the wounded were removed, and four guns turned against the ten-gun battery. The officer, Comrade Tushin, was killed at the beginning of the case, and in the course of an hour, out of forty servants, seventeen left, but the gunners were still cheerful and lively.

"— Дай-ка сюда это письмо, — сказал Кутузов, обращаясь к князю Андрею. — Вот изволите видеть. — И Кутузов, с насмешливою улыбкой на концах губ, прочел по-немецки австрийскому генералу следующее место из письма эрцгерцога Фердинанда: «Wir haben vollkommen zusammengehaltene Krafte, nahe an 70 000 Mann, um den Feind, wenn er den Lech passirte, angreifen und schlagen zu konnen.

"Сражение, состоявшее только в том, что захвачен эскадрон французов, было представлено как блестящая победа над французами, и потому государь и вся армия, особенно после того, как не разошелся еще пороховой дым на поле сражения, верили, что французы побеждены и отступают против своей воли.

His whole time was taken up with dinners and balls, and was spent chiefly at Prince Vasili’s house in the company of the stout princess, his wife, and his beautiful daughter Hélène."

Поглядев за перила вниз, князь Несвицкий видел быстрые, шумные, невысокие волны Энса, которые, сливаясь, рябея и загибаясь около свай моста, перегоняли одна другую. Поглядев на мост, он видел столь же однообразные живые волны солдат, кутасы, кивера с чехлами, ранцы, штыки, длинные ружья и из-под киверов лица с широкими скулами, ввалившимися щеками и беззаботно-усталыми выражениями и движущиеся ноги по натасканной на доски моста липкой грязи.

"На лице Анны Михайловны выразилось сознание того, что решительная минута наступила; она, с приемами деловой петербургской дамы, вошла в комнату, не отпуская от себя Пьера, еще смелее, чем утром.

His hand shook as he turned his horse over to the handler, and he felt the blood throbbing as it rose to his heart. Denisov, lurching backwards and shouting something, rode past him. Rostov saw nothing but the hussars running around him, their spurs catching and their sabers clanking. “Stretcher!”","Their sabres catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The men were crossing themselves. Rostov no longer looked at the colonel, he had no time. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid that his heart stood still. His hand trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly’s charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud. Denisov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something. Rostov saw nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs catching and their sabres clattering. ‘Stretchers!’"

"Когда чтение, продолжавшееся более часу, было кончено, Ланжерон, опять остановив табакерку и не глядя на Вейротера и ни на кого особенно, начал говорить о том, как трудно было исполнить такую диспозицию, где положение неприятеля предполагается известным, тогда как положение это может быть нам неизвестно, так как неприятель находится в движении. Возражения Ланжерона были основательны, но было очевидно, что цель этих возражений состояла преимущественно в желании дать почувствовать генералу Вейротеру, столь самоуверенно, как школьникам-ученикам, читавшему свою диспозицию, что он имел дело не с одними дураками, а с людьми, которые могли и его поучить в военном деле. Когда замолк однообразный звук голоса Вейротера, Кутузов открыл глава, как мельник, который просыпается при перерыве усыпительного звука мельничных колес, прислушался к тому, что говорил Ланжерон, и, как будто говоря: «а вы всё еще про эти глупости!» поспешно закрыл глаза и еще ниже опустил голову.","When the reading, which lasted more than an hour, was over, Langeron, again stopping the snuffbox and not looking at Weyrother and at no one in particular, began to talk about how difficult it was to carry out such a disposition, where the position of the enemy is supposed to be known, while this position can be we do not know, as the enemy is on the move. Lanzheron's objections were sound, but it was obvious that the purpose of these objections was mainly to make General Weyrother, as self-confidently as he read his disposition, feel to General Weyrother that he was dealing not only with fools, but with people who could and teach him about the military. When the monotonous sound of Weyrother's voice ceased, Kutuzov opened his head, like a miller who wakes up during a break in the sleepy sound of the mill wheels, listened to what Langeron was saying, and, as if saying: ""But you are still talking about these nonsense!"" Hastily closed his eyes and lowered his head even lower.","When the reading, which lasted more than an hour, was over, Langeron again stopped the snuffbox and, without looking at Weyrother or anyone in particular, began speaking about the difficulty of following such a disposition, in which the position of the enemy is assumed to be known, when that position may not be known to us, since the enemy is on the move. Langeron's objections were well-founded, but it was obvious that the purpose of those objections consisted primarily in bringing it home to General Weyrother, who had read his disposition with such self-assurance, as if to schoolboys, that he had to do not with mere fools, but with people who could give him lessons in military matters. When the monotonous sound of Weyrother's voice fell silent, Kutuzov opened his eyes, like a miller who wakes up at an interruption of the soporific sound of the mill wheels, listened to what Langeron was saying, and—as if to say, “Ah, you're still going on about these stupidities!”—quickly closed his eyes and lowered his head still more.","When the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron again brought his snuff-box to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at anyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry out such a plan in which the enemy’s position was assumed to be known, whereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement. Langeron’s objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim was to show General Weyrother—who had read his dispositions with as much self-confidence as if he were addressing schoolchildren—that he had to do not with fools but with men who could teach him something in military matters. When the monotonous sound of Weyrother’s voice ceased, Kutuzov opened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill-wheel is interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking, ‘So you are still at that silly business!’ quickly closed his eye again and let his head sink still lower."
"Читая это место, Пьер в первый раз почувствовал, что между ним и Элен образовалась какая-то связь, признаваемая другими людьми, и эта мысль в одно и то же время и испугала его, как будто на него накладывалось обязательство, которое он не мог сдержать, и вместе понравилась ему, как забавное предположение.","Reading this place, Pierre for the first time felt that some kind of connection had formed between him and Helen, recognized by other people, and this thought at the same time frightened him, as if an obligation was imposed on him that he could not keep. , and together he liked it, as an amusing assumption.","Reading this passage, Pierre felt for the first time that between him and Hélène some sort of connection had been formed, recognized by other people, and this thought at the same time frightened him, as if an obligation had been laid upon him which he could not fulfill, and also pleased him as an amusing supposition.","When he read that sentence Pierre felt for the first time that some link which other people recognized, had grown up between himself and Hélène, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfil, and pleased him as an entertaining supposition."

"Вследствие этого страшного гула, шума, потребности внимания и деятельности Тушин не испытывал ни малейшего неприятного чувства страха, и мысль, что его могут убить или больно ранить, не приходила ему в голову. Напротив, ему становилось всё веселее и веселее. Ему казалось, что уже очень давно, едва ли не вчера, была та минута, когда он увидел неприятеля и сделал первый выстрел, и что клочок поля, на котором он стоял, был ему давно знакомым, родственным местом. Несмотря на то, что он всё помнил, всё соображал, всё делал, что мог делать самый лучший офицер в его положении, он находился в состоянии, похожем на лихорадочный бред или на состояние пьяного человека.","As a result of this terrible rumble, noise, need for attention and activity, Tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant feeling of fear, and the thought that they might kill him or hurt him painfully did not occur to him. On the contrary, he became more and more cheerful. It seemed to him that a very long time ago, almost yesterday, there was that moment when he saw the enemy and fired the first shot, and that the patch of field on which he stood was a familiar, kindred place to him for a long time. Despite the fact that he remembered everything, thought everything, did everything that the best officer in his position could do, he was in a state similar to feverish delirium or the state of a drunk person.","As a result of the dreadful rumbling, the noise, the necessity for attention and activity, Tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant feeling of fear, and the thought that he could be killed or painfully wounded did not occur to him.

"Пьер так и не успел выбрать себе карьеры в Петербурге и, действительно, был выслан в Москву за буйство. История, которую рассказывали у графа Ростова, была справедлива. Пьер участвовал в связываньи квартального с медведем. Он приехал несколько дней тому назад и остановился, как всегда, в доме своего отца. Хотя он и предполагал, что история его уже известна в Москве, и что дамы, окружающие его отца, всегда недоброжелательные к нему, воспользуются этим случаем, чтобы раздражить графа, он всё-таки в день приезда пошел на половину отца. Войдя в гостиную, обычное местопребывание княжен, он поздоровался с дамами, сидевшими за пяльцами и за книгой, которую вслух читала одна из них. Их было три. Старшая, чистоплотная, с длинною талией, строгая девица, та самая, которая выходила к Анне Михайловне, читала; младшие, обе румяные и хорошенькие, отличавшиеся друг от друга только тем, что у одной была родинка над губой, очень красившая ее, шили в пяльцах. Пьер был встречен как мертвец или зачумленный. Старшая княжна прервала чтение и молча посмотрела на него испуганными глазами; младшая, без родинки, приняла точно такое же выражение; самая меньшая, с родинкой, веселого и смешливого характера, нагнулась к пяльцам, чтобы скрыть улыбку, вызванную, вероятно, предстоящею сценой, забавность которой она предвидела. Она притянула вниз шерстинку и нагнулась, будто разбирая узоры и едва удерживаясь от смеха.","Pierre did not have time to choose a career for himself in St. Petersburg and, indeed, was exiled to Moscow for riot. The story told at Count Rostov's was true. Pierre participated in tying the quarter with a bear. He arrived a few days ago and stayed, as always, at his father's house. Although he assumed that his story was already known in Moscow, and that the ladies surrounding his father, who were always unfriendly to him, would take advantage of this opportunity to annoy the count, he nevertheless went to half his father on the day of his arrival. Entering the living room, the usual residence of the princesses, he greeted the ladies who were sitting at the embroidery frame and at the book, which one of them was reading aloud. There were three. The eldest, clean, long-waisted, strict girl, the same one who went out to Anna Mikhailovna, was reading; the younger ones, both ruddy and pretty, differing from each other only in that one had a mole above her lip, which made her very pretty, sewed in a hoop. Pierre was greeted as dead or plagued. The eldest princess interrupted her reading and silently looked at him with frightened eyes; the youngest, without a mole, assumed exactly the same expression; the smallest, with a mole, of a merry and humorous disposition, bent down to the hoop to hide a smile, probably provoked by the upcoming scene, the amusingness of which she foresaw. She pulled down the hair and bent down, as if sorting out the patterns and barely able to keep from laughing.","Pierre had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg, and had indeed been banished to Moscow for riotous behavior. The story told at Count Rostov's was true. Pierre had taken part in tying the policeman to the bear. He had arrived several days ago and was staying, as usual, at his father's house. Though he supposed that his story was already known in Moscow, and that the ladies who surrounded his father, always ill-disposed towards him, would have used this chance to rile the count, he nevertheless went to his father's part of the house the day he arrived. On entering the drawing room, where the princesses were usually to be found, he greeted the ladies, who were sitting over their embroidery and a book, which one of them was reading aloud. There were three of them. The eldest, a neat, long-waisted, stern young lady, the one who had come out to Anna Mikhailovna, was reading; the younger ones, both red-cheeked and pretty, differing from each other only in that one had a mole above her lip, which was very becoming to her, were doing embroidery. Pierre was met like a dead man or a leper. The eldest princess interrupted her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes; the younger one, without the mole, assumed exactly the same expression; the youngest, with the mole, of a merry, laughter-prone character, bent over her embroidery frame to hide a smile, probably evoked by the forthcoming scene, which she foresaw would be amusing. She drew the woollen thread through and bent down as if studying the design, barely able to keep from laughing.","PIERRE, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to Moscow.

Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father—who were never favourably disposed towards him—would have used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father’s part of the house. Entering the drawing-room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the eldest who was reading—the one who had met Anna Mikhailovna. The two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper. The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression; while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw.

"И, отделавшись от молодого человека, не умеющего жить, она возвратилась к своим занятиям хозяйки дома и продолжала прислушиваться и приглядываться, готовая подать помощь на тот пункт, где ослабевал разговор. Как хозяин прядильной мастерской, посадив работников по местам, прохаживается по заведению, замечая неподвижность или непривычный, скрипящий, слишком громкий звук веретена, торопливо идет, сдерживает или пускает его в надлежащий ход, так и Анна Павловна, прохаживаясь по своей гостиной, подходила к замолкнувшему или слишком много говорившему кружку и одним словом или перемещением опять заводила равномерную, приличную разговорную машину. Но среди этих забот всё виден был в ней особенный страх за Пьера. Она заботливо поглядывала на него в то время, как он подошел послушать то, что говорилось около Мортемара, и отошел к другому кружку, где говорил аббат. Для Пьера, воспитанного за границей, этот вечер Анны Павловны был первый, который он видел в России. Он знал, что тут собрана вся интеллигенция Петербурга, и у него, как у ребенка в игрушечной лавке, разбегались глаза. Он всё боялся пропустить умные разговоры, которые он может услыхать. Глядя на уверенные и изящные выражения лиц, собранных здесь, он всё ждал чего-нибудь особенно умного. Наконец, он подошел к Морио. Разговор показался ему интересен, и он остановился, ожидая случая высказать свои мысли, как это любят молодые люди.","And, having got rid of the young man who did not know how to live, she returned to her occupations as a mistress of the house and continued to listen and look, ready to give help to the point where the conversation was weakening. Just as the owner of a spinning workshop, having seated the workers in their places, paces around the establishment, noticing the immobility or the unusual, creaking, too loud sound of the spindle, hurriedly walks, restrains or sets it in its proper course, so Anna Pavlovna, pacing around her drawing room, approached the silent or a mug that was talking too much, and with one word or movement would start up again a regular, decent conversational machine. But among these worries, one could still see in her a special fear for Pierre. She looked at him solicitously as he approached to hear what was said about Mortemart, and went to another circle where the abbe was speaking. For Pierre, brought up abroad, this evening of Anna Pavlovna was the first he saw in Russia. He knew that all the intelligentsia of St. Petersburg were gathered here, and his eyes widened like a child in a toy store. He was afraid of missing the smart conversations he might overhear. Looking at the confident and graceful expressions of the faces gathered here, he kept waiting for something especially clever. Finally, he approached Morio. The conversation seemed interesting to him, and he stopped, waiting for an opportunity to express his thoughts, as young people like it.","And, ridding herself of the young man who did not know how to live, she returned to her duties as mistress of the house and went on listening and looking out, ready to come to the rescue at any point where the conversation lagged. As the owner of a spinning mill, having put his workers in their places, strolls about the establishment, watching out for an idle spindle or the odd one squealing much too loudly, and hastens to go and slow it down or start it up at the proper speed—so Anna Pavlovna strolled about her drawing room, going up to a circle that had fallen silent or was too talkative, and with one word or rearrangement set the conversation machine running evenly and properly again. But amidst all these cares there could still be seen in her a special fear for Pierre. She glanced at him concernedly when he went over to listen to what was being talked about around Mortemart and went on to another circle where the abbé was talking. For Pierre, brought up abroad, this soirée of Anna Pavlovna's was the first he had seen in Russia. He knew that all the intelligentsia of Petersburg was gathered there, and, like a child in a toy shop, he looked everywhere at once. He kept fearing to miss intelligent conversations that he might have listened to. Looking at the self-assured and elegant expressions on the faces gathered here, he kept expecting something especially intelligent. Finally he went up to Morio. The conversation seemed interesting to him, and he stopped, waiting for a chance to voice his thoughts, as young people like to do.","And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the foreman of a spinning-mill when he has set the hands to work, goes round and notices, here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pavlovna moved about her drawing-room, approaching now a silent, now a too noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to another group whose centre was the abbé. Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pavlovna’s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toy shop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing."
"— Да нечего делать, дружок, — сказал князь, — они все такие, не разженишься. Ты не бойся; никому не скажу; а ты сам знаешь.","“Yes, there’s nothing to do, my friend,” said the prince, “they are all like that, you won’t get married.” Do not be afraid; I won't tell anyone; and you yourself know.","“Nothing to be done, my friend,” said the prince, “they're all like that, no use unmarrying.

"«Где я? Да, в цепи: лозунг и пароль — дышло, Ольмюц. Экая досада, что эскадрон наш завтра будет в резервах… — подумал он. — Попрошусь в дело. Это, может быть, единственный случай увидеть государя. Да, теперь недолго до смены. Объеду еще раз и, как вернусь, пойду к генералу и попрошу его». Он поправился на седле и тронул лошадь, чтобы еще раз объехать своих гусар. Ему показалось, что было светлей. В левой стороне виднелся пологий освещенный скат и противоположный, черный бугор, казавшийся крутым, как стена. На бугре этом было белое пятно, которого никак не мог понять Ростов: поляна ли это в лесу, освещенная месяцем, или оставшийся снег, или белые дома? Ему показалось даже, что по этому белому пятну зашевелилось что-то. «Должно быть, снег — это пятно; пятно — une tache», думал Ростов. «Вот тебе и не таш…»","""Where I am? Yes, in chains: the slogan and the password are the drawbar, Olmutz. What a pity that our squadron will be in reserve tomorrow... he thought. - I'll ask to work. This may be the only chance to see the sovereign. Yes, it's not long before the change. I’ll go around again and, when I get back, I’ll go to the general and ask him.” He recovered in the saddle and touched the horse in order to once again go around his hussars. He thought it was brighter. On the left side one could see a gentle, illuminated slope and the opposite, black hillock, which seemed steep, like a wall. There was a white spot on this hillock, which Rostov could not understand in any way: was it a clearing in the forest, illuminated by the moon, or the remaining snow, or white houses? It even seemed to him that something stirred over this white spot. “The snow must be a stain; the stain is une tache, thought Rostov. “Here you don’t tash ...”","“Where am I? Ah, yes, in the line; watchword and password—'shaft,' ' Olmütz.' How vexing that our squadron will be in reserve tomorrow ...” he thought. “I'll ask to be sent into action. That may be the only chance I'll get to see the sovereign. Yes, it's not long now till we're relieved. I'll make another round, and as soon as I get back, I'll go to the general and ask him.” He righted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse, in order to make one more round of his hussars. He thought it was getting lighter. To the left he could see a sloping, lit-up hillside and across from it a black knoll that seemed steep as a wall. On this knoll was a white spot that Rostov could not make sense of: was it a moonlit clearing in the woods, or some leftover snow, or some white houses? It even seemed to him that something was moving on that white spot. “It must be snow—this spot; a spot—une tache,” thought Rostov. “Tache or no tache ...”","‘Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line … pass and watchword—shaft, Olmütz. What a nuisance that our squadron will be in reserve tomorrow,’ he thought. ‘I’ll ask leave to go to the front, this may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor. It won’t be long now before I am off duty. I’ll take another turn and when I get back I’ll go to the general and ask him.’ He readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars. It seemed to him that it was getting lighter. To the left he saw a sloping descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall. On this knoll there was a white patch that Rostov could not at all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought something moved on that white spot. ‘It must be snow … that spot … a spot—une tache,’ he thought. ‘There now … it’s not a tache … Natasha … sister, black eyes"

"Один из говоривших был штатский, с морщинистым, желчным и бритым худым лицом, человек, уже приближавшийся к старости, хотя и одетый, как самый модный молодой человек; он сидел с ногами на отоманке с видом домашнего человека и, сбоку запустив себе далеко в рот янтарь, порывисто втягивал дым и жмурился. Это был старый холостяк Шиншин, двоюродный брат графини, злой язык, как про него говорили в московских гостиных. Он, казалось, снисходил до своего собеседника. Другой, свежий, розовый, гвардейский офицер, безупречно вымытый, застегнутый и причесанный, держал янтарь у середины рта и розовыми губами слегка вытягивал дымок, выпуская его колечками из красивого рта. Это был тот поручик Берг, офицер Семеновского полка, с которым Борис ехал вместе в полк и которым Наташа дразнила Веру, старшую графиню, называя Берга ее женихом. Граф сидел между ними и внимательно слушал. Самое приятное для графа занятие, за исключением игры в бостон, которую он очень любил, было положение слушающего, особенно когда ему удавалось стравить двух говорливых собеседников.","One of the speakers was a civilian, with a wrinkled, bilious, and shaven, thin face, a man already approaching old age, although he was dressed like the most fashionable young man; he sat with his feet on the ottoman with the air of a domestic man, and, sideways thrusting amber far into his mouth, impetuously drew in the smoke and screwed up his eyes. It was the old bachelor Shinshin, the cousin of the countess, an evil tongue, as they said about him in Moscow drawing rooms. He seemed to condescend to his interlocutor. Another, fresh, pink, officer of the Guards, impeccably washed, buttoned and combed, held amber near the middle of his mouth and with pink lips slightly pulled out the smoke, releasing it in ringlets from his beautiful mouth. It was that lieutenant Berg, an officer of the Semyonovsky regiment, with whom Boris went to the regiment together and with which Natasha teased Vera, the senior countess, calling Berg her fiancé. The Count sat between them and listened attentively. The most pleasant occupation for the count, with the exception of the game of boston, which he was very fond of, was the position of the listener, especially when he managed to play off two talkative interlocutors.","One of the talkers was a civilian with a wrinkled, bilious, gaunt, and cleanshaven face, a man approaching old age, though dressed like a most fashionable young man; he sat with his feet on the ottoman, looking like a familiar of the house, the amber bit deep in the side of his mouth, impetuously sucking in smoke and squinting. This was the old bachelor Shinshin, the countess's cousin, a wicked tongue, as the talk went in Moscow drawing rooms. He seemed to be condescending to his interlocutor. The other, a fresh, pink officer of the guards, impeccably scrubbed, combed, and buttoned-up, held the amber bit in the middle of his mouth and drew the smoke in lightly with his pink lips, letting it out of his handsome mouth in rings. This was that Lieutenant Berg, an officer of the Semyonovsky regiment, with whom Boris was going off to join the regiment, and whom Natasha, teasing Vera, her older sister, called her fiancé. The count sat between them and listened attentively.

The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed, brushed and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semyonov regiment with whom Boris was to travel to join the army, and about whom Natasha had teased her elder sister Vera, speaking of Berg as her ‘intended’. The count sat between them and listened attentively. His favourite occupation when not playing boston,* a card game he was very fond of, was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another."

Я решительно отказалась: у меня дочери.","“They rescued this unfortunate man by force,” continued the visitor. - And this is the son of Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov, who is so cleverly amused! she added. - And they said that he was so well educated and smart.

I resolutely refused: I have daughters.","“They barely managed to save the poor fellow,” the guest went on. “That's how intelligently the son of Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov amuses himself!” she added. “And I heard he was so well-bred and intelligent.

"— Schon fleissig! [Уже за работой!] — сказал Ростов всё с тою же радостною, братскою улыбкой, какая не сходила с его оживленного лица. — Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen! Kaiser Alexander hoch!

"Ростов в эту ночь был со взводом во фланкёрской цепи, впереди отряда Багратиона. Гусары его попарно были рассыпаны в цепи; сам он ездил верхом по этой линии цепи, стараясь преодолеть сон, непреодолимо-клонивший его. Назади его видно было огромное пространство неясно-горевших в тумане костров нашей армии; впереди его была туманная темнота. Сколько ни вглядывался Ростов в эту туманную даль, он ничего не видел: то серелось, то как будто чернелось что-то; то мелькали как будто огоньки, там, где должен быть неприятель; то ему думалось, что это только в глазах блестит у него. Глаза его закрывались, и в воображении представлялся то государь, то Денисов, то московские воспоминания, и он опять поспешно открывал глаза и близко перед собой он видел голову и уши лошади, на которой он сидел, иногда черные фигуры гусар, когда он в шести шагах наезжал на них, а вдали всё ту же туманную темноту. «Отчего же? очень может быть, — думал Ростов, — что государь, встретив меня, даст поручение, как и всякому офицеру: скажет: „Поезжай, узнай, что там“. Много рассказывали же, как совершенно случайно он узнал так какого-то офицера и приблизил к себе. Что, ежели бы он приблизил меня к себе! О, как бы я охранял его, как бы я говорил ему всю правду, как бы я изобличал его обманщиков», и Ростов, для того чтобы живо представить себе свою любовь и преданность государю, представлял себе врага или обманщика-немца, которого он с наслаждением не только убивал, но по щекам бил в глазах государя. Вдруг дальний крик разбудил Ростова. Он вздрогнул и открыл глаза.","Rostov that night was with a platoon in the flanker chain, ahead of Bagration's detachment. His hussars were scattered in pairs in chains; he himself rode along this line of the chain, trying to overcome the sleep that irresistibly inclined him. Behind him one could see a huge expanse of vaguely burning fires of our army in the fog; ahead of him was misty darkness. No matter how much Rostov peered into this foggy distance, he did not see anything: it turned gray, then something seemed to blacken; then flashed like lights, where the enemy should be; then he thought that it was only in his eyes that it glittered. His eyes were closed, and in his imagination he imagined either the sovereign, then Denisov, then Moscow memories, and again he hastily opened his eyes and close in front of him he saw the head and ears of the horse on which he was sitting, sometimes the black figures of hussars, when he was six paces away ran into them, and in the distance the same foggy darkness. ""From what? it is very possible, thought Rostov, that the sovereign, having met me, will give an order, as he would to any officer: he will say: “Go, find out what is there.” They told a lot how, quite by accident, he recognized some officer in this way and brought him closer to him. What if he brought me closer to him! Oh, how I would protect him, how I would tell him the whole truth, how I would expose his deceivers, ”and Rostov, in order to vividly imagine his love and devotion to the sovereign, imagined an enemy or a German deceiver, whom he and with pleasure he not only killed, but beat on the cheeks in the eyes of the sovereign. Suddenly a distant cry woke Rostov. He shuddered and opened his eyes.","That night Rostov was on the picket line with his platoon forward of Bagra-tion's detachment. His hussars were scattered in pairs along the line; he himself rode the line on horseback, trying to fight off the sleep that was irresistibly overcoming him. Behind him could be seen the immense expanse of our army's campfires burning dimly in the mist; ahead of him was misty darkness. However much Rostov peered into this misty distance, he saw nothing: now some grayish, some blackish shape seemed to appear; now it was as if lights flickered where the enemy ought to be; now it seemed only some glimmer in his own eyes. His eyes kept closing, and in his imagination the sovereign appeared, then Denisov, then Moscow memories, and he hurriedly opened his eyes again and saw close in front of him the head and ears of the horse he was riding, sometimes the black figures of hussars, when he came within six paces of them, and in the distance the same misty darkness. “Why not? It might well be,” thought Rostov, “that the sovereign, meeting me, gives me some assignment, saying as to any officer: 'Go and find out what's there.' There are many stories about how he got to know some officer quite by chance and attached him to himself. What if he attached me to himself? Oh, how I'd protect him, how I'd tell him the whole truth, how I'd expose the deceivers!” And so as to picture vividly to himself his love and devotion for the sovereign, he pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom he delighted not only in killing, but in slapping in the face before the sovereign's eyes. Suddenly a distant cry aroused Rostov. He gave a start and opened his eyes.","THAT same night Rostov was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front of Bagration’s detachment. His hussars were placed along the line in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the sleepiness that kept coming over him. An enormous space, with our army’s camp-fires dimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind him, in front of him was misty darkness. Rostov could see nothing, peer as he would into that foggy distance: now something gleamed grey, now there was something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy ought to be, now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes. His eyes kept closing, and in his imagination appeared—now the Emperor, now Denisov, and now Moscow memories—and he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding, and sometimes when he came within six paces of them, the black figures of hussars, but in the distance was still the same misty darkness. ‘Why not? … it might easily happen,’ thought Rostov, ‘that the Emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer; he’ll say: “Go and find out what’s there.” There are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him to himself! What if he gave me a place near him? Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would unmask his deceivers!’ And in order to realize vividly his love and devotion to the sovereign, Rostov pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before the Emperor. Suddenly a distant shout aroused him. He started and opened his eyes."
"«Боже мой! что бы со мной было, ежели бы ко мне обратился государь! — думал Ростов: — я бы умер от счастия».","""Oh my God! what would happen to me if the sovereign turned to me! - thought Rostov: - I would die of happiness.",“My God! what would happen to me if the sovereign addressed me!” thought Rostov. “I'd die of happiness.”,"‘Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?’ thought Rostov. ‘I would die of happiness!’"

"Пьер, решившись во всем повиноваться своей руководительнице, направился к диванчику, который она ему указала. Как только Анна Михайловна скрылась, он заметил, что взгляды всех, бывших в комнате, больше чем с любопытством и с участием устремились на него. Он заметил, что все перешептывались, указывая на него глазами, как будто со страхом и даже с подобострастием. Ему оказывали уважение, какого прежде никогда не оказывали: неизвестная ему дама, которая говорила с духовными лицами, встала с своего места и предложила ему сесть, адъютант поднял уроненную Пьером перчатку и подал ему; доктора почтительно замолкли, когда он проходил мимо их, и посторонились, чтобы дать ему место. Пьер хотел сначала сесть на другое место, чтобы не стеснять даму, хотел сам поднять перчатку и обойти докторов, которые вовсе и не стояли на дороге; но он вдруг почувствовал, что это было бы неприлично, он почувствовал, что он в нынешнюю ночь есть лицо, которое обязано совершить какой-то страшный и ожидаемый всеми обряд, и что поэтому он должен был принимать от всех услуги. Он принял молча перчатку от адъютанта, сел на место дамы, положив свои большие руки на симметрично-выставленные колени, в наивной позе египетской статуи, и решил про себя, что всё это так именно должно быть и что ему в нынешний вечер, для того чтобы не потеряться и не наделать глупостей, не следует действовать по своим соображениям, а надобно предоставить себя вполне на волю тех, которые руководили им.","Pierre, deciding to obey his leader in everything, went to the sofa, which she pointed out to him. As soon as Anna Mikhaylovna disappeared, he noticed that the eyes of everyone in the room were fixed on him with more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that everyone was whispering, pointing at him with eyes, as if with fear and even servility. He was shown respect that had never been shown before: a lady unknown to him, who spoke with clerics, got up from her seat and invited him to sit down, the adjutant picked up the glove dropped by Pierre and gave it to him; the doctors fell silent respectfully as he passed them, and stepped aside to make room for him. Pierre wanted to first sit in another place so as not to embarrass the lady, he wanted to pick up his glove himself and go around the doctors, who did not even stand on the road; but he suddenly felt that it would be indecent, he felt that on this night he was a person who was obliged to perform some kind of terrible and expected rite by everyone, and that therefore he had to accept services from everyone. He silently accepted the adjutant's glove, sat down in the lady's place, placing his large hands on his symmetrically exposed knees, in the naive pose of an Egyptian statue, and decided to himself that all this should be exactly like that and that he needed this evening, in order to not to get lost and not to do stupid things, one should not act according to one's own considerations, but one must leave oneself completely to the will of those who led him.","Pierre, having decided to obey his guide in all things, made for the little settee she had pointed out to him.

Pierre first wanted to sit somewhere else, so as not to inconvenience the lady, wanted to pick up the glove himself, and to bypass the doctors, who were not standing in his way; but he suddenly felt that that would be improper, he felt that that night he was the person responsible for performing some terrible rite which everyone expected, and that he therefore had to accept services from them all. He silently accepted the glove from the adjutant, sat down in the lady's place, putting his big hands on his symmetrically displayed knees in the naïve pose of an Egyptian statue, and decided to himself that this was precisely as it had to be and that that evening, so as not to lose his head and do something foolish, he ought not to act according to his own reasoning, but give himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him.","Pierre having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved towards the sofa she had indicated.

Recalling his recent impressions the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War, the polite Austrian adjutant, Bilibin, and last night’s conversation. Having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he had not worn for a long time, he went into Bilibin’s study fresh, animated and handsome, with his hand bandaged. In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps. With Prince Ippolit Kuragin, who was a secretary to the embassy, Bolkonsky was already acquainted. Bilibin introduced him to the others."
"— Да, съездите, пожалуйста, — сказал генерал, повторяя то, что уже раз подробно было приказано, — и скажите гусарам, чтобы они последние перешли и зажгли мост, как я приказывал, да чтобы горючие материалы на мосту еще осмотреть.","“Yes, please go,” said the general, repeating what had already been ordered once in detail, “and tell the hussars to be the last to cross and light the bridge, as I ordered, and to inspect the combustible materials on the bridge.","“Yes, please do,” said the general, repeating what had already been ordered in detail, “and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and set fire to the bridge as I said, and inspect the flammable material while still on the bridge.”","‘Yes, please do,’ answered the general, and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail: ‘and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the inflammable material on the bridge must be re-inspected.’"

"Полковой командир, в ту самую минуту как он услыхал стрельбу и крик сзади, понял, что случилось что-нибудь ужасное с его полком, и мысль, что он, примерный, много лет служивший, ни в чем не виноватый офицер, мог быть виновен перед начальством в оплошности или нераспорядительности, так поразила его, что в ту же минуту, забыв и непокорного кавалериста-полковника и свою генеральскую важность, а главное — совершенно забыв про опасность и чувство самосохранения, он, ухватившись за луку седла и шпоря лошадь, поскакал к полку под градом обсыпавших, но счастливо миновавших его пуль.

"С вечера, на последнем переходе, был получен приказ, что главнокомандующий будет смотреть полк на походе. Хотя слова приказа и показались неясны полковому командиру, и возник вопрос, как разуметь слова приказа: в походной форме или нет? в совете батальонных командиров было решено представить полк в парадной форме на том основании, что всегда лучше перекланяться, чем не докланяться. И солдаты, после тридцативерстного перехода, не смыкали глаз, всю ночь чинились, чистились; адъютанты и ротные рассчитывали, отчисляли; и к утру полк, вместо растянутой беспорядочной толпы, какою он был накануне на последнем переходе, представлял стройную массу 2 000 людей, из которых каждый знал свое место, свое дело и из которых на каждом каждая пуговка и ремешок были на своем месте и блестели чистотой. Не только наружное было исправно, но ежели бы угодно было главнокомандующему заглянуть под мундиры, то на каждом он увидел бы одинаково чистую рубаху и в каждом ранце нашел бы узаконенное число вещей, «шильце и мыльце», как говорят солдаты. Было только одно обстоятельство, насчет которого никто не мог быть спокоен. Это была обувь. Больше чем у половины людей сапоги были разбиты. Но недостаток этот происходил не от вины полкового командира, так как, несмотря на неоднократные требования, ему не был отпущен товар от австрийского ведомства, а полк прошел тысячу верст.","In the evening, on the last march, an order was received that the commander-in-chief would watch the regiment on the march. Although the words of the order seemed unclear to the regimental commander, and the question arose of how to understand the words of the order: in marching uniform or not? in the council of battalion commanders, it was decided to present the regiment in full dress on the basis that it is always better to exchange bows than not to bow. And the soldiers, after a thirty-verst march, did not close their eyes, they repaired and cleaned themselves all night; adjutants and company officers counted, expelled; and by morning the regiment, instead of the sprawling disorderly crowd that it had been the day before on the last march, represented a slender mass of 2,000 people, each of whom knew his place, his business, and of whom each button and strap was in its place and shone with cleanliness. . Not only the outer was in good order, but if the commander-in-chief had been pleased to look under the uniforms, then on each he would have seen an equally clean shirt and in each knapsack he would have found a legal number of things, “an awl and a soap,” as the soldiers say. There was only one circumstance about which no one could be calm. It was shoes. More than half of the people had their boots broken. But this shortcoming did not come from the fault of the regimental commander, since, despite repeated demands, the goods from the Austrian department were not released to him, and the regiment traveled a thousand miles.","In the evening of the latest march an order had been received that the commander in chief would review the regiment on the march. Though the wording of the order seemed unclear to the regimental commander and the question arose of how to take the wording of the order—in marching uniform or not?—in the council of battalion commanders it was decided to present the regiment for review in parade uniform, on the grounds that it is always better to bow too much than not to bow enough. And so the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, without a wink of sleep, spent the whole night mending and cleaning; the adjutants and company commanders calculated and counted off; and by morning the regiment, instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been the day before, during the latest march, was a well-ordered mass of two thousand men, each of whom knew his place, his duty, each of whose buttons and straps was in its place and sparkling clean. Not only were the externals in good order, but if it should please the commander in chief to look under the uniform, he would see on each man the same clean shirt, and in each pack he would find the prescribed number of things, “the whole kit and caboodle,” as soldiers say. There was only one circumstance with regard to which no one could be at ease. This was footgear. More than half the men had their boots falling to pieces. But this shortcoming was not the regimental commander's fault, since, despite his repeated requests, the Austrian department had not released a supply, and the regiment had walked seven hundred miles.","On the evening of the last day’s march an order had been received that the commander-in-chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders, to present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is always better to ‘bow too low than not bow low enough’. So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by morning the regiment—instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before—presented a well-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had every button and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness. And not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander-in-chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack, the appointed number of articles, ‘awl, soap, and all’, as the soldiers say. There was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease. It was the state of the soldiers’ boots. More than half the men’s boots were in holes. But this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles."

Хотя орудия Тушина были назначены для того, чтоб обстреливать лощину, он стрелял брандскугелями по видневшейся впереди деревне Шенграбен, перед которой выдвигались большие массы французов.","Bagration called out to the officer, and Tushin, with a timid and awkward movement, not at all like the military salute, but like the priests bless, putting three fingers to the visor, approached the general. Although Tushin's guns were assigned to bombard the hollow, he fired fire-brandskugels at the village of Shengraben, visible ahead, in front of which large masses of the French advanced.","Bagration called to the officer, and Tushin went over to the general, putting three fingers to his visor in a timid and awkward movement, not as military men salute, but as priests bless. Though Tushin's guns were meant to be shooting into the hollow, he was sending fireballs at the village of Schöngraben visible straight ahead, before which large masses of French were moving forward.","Bagration called to him, and Tushin, raising three fingers to his cap, with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a priest’s benediction, approached the general. Though Tushin’s guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was firing incendiary balls at the village of Schön Grabern visible just opposite, in front of which large masses of French were advancing."
— Хороший.,- Good.,“Yes.”,"‘Yes, indeed!’"
"— Куда вы? — спрашивал пехотный офицер, евший яблоко, тоже полуулыбаясь и глядя на красивую девушку.","- Where are you going? asked the infantry officer, who was eating an apple, also half-smiling and looking at the beautiful girl.","“Where are you going?” asked an infantry officer, eating an apple, also with a half smile and looking at the beautiful girl.","‘Where are you going?’ asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl."
"«Верно, наш пленный… Да. Неужели и меня возьмут? Что это за люди?» всё думал Ростов, не веря своим глазам. «Неужели французы?» Он смотрел на приближавшихся французов, и, несмотря на то, что за секунду скакал только затем, чтобы настигнуть этих французов и изрубить их, близость их казалась ему теперь так ужасна, что он не верил своим глазам. «Кто они? Зачем они бегут? Неужели ко мне? Неужели ко мне они бегут? И зачем? Убить меня? Меня, кого так любят все?» — Ему вспомнилась любовь к нему его матери, семьи, друзей, и намерение неприятелей убить его показалось невозможно. «А может, — и убить!» Он более десяти секунд стоял, не двигаясь с места и не понимая своего положения. Передний француз с горбатым носом подбежал так близко, что уже видно было выражение его лица. И разгоряченная чуждая физиономия этого человека, который со штыком на-перевес, сдерживая дыханье, легко подбегал к нему, испугала Ростова. Он схватил пистолет и, вместо того чтобы стрелять из него, бросил им в француза и побежал к кустам что было силы. Не с тем чувством сомнения и борьбы, с каким он ходил на Энский мост, бежал он, а с чувством зайца, убегающего от собак. Одно нераздельное чувство страха за свою молодую, счастливую жизнь владело всем его существом. Быстро перепрыгивая через межи, с тою стремительностью, с которою он бегал, играя в горелки, он летел по полю, изредка оборачивая свое бледное, доброе, молодое лицо, и холод ужаса пробегал по его спине. «Нет, лучше не смотреть», подумал он, но, подбежав к кустам, оглянулся еще раз. Французы отстали, и даже в ту минуту как он оглянулся, передний только что переменил рысь на шаг и, обернувшись, что-то сильно кричал заднему товарищу. Ростов остановился. «Что-нибудь не так, — подумал он, — не может быть, чтоб они хотели убить меня». А между тем левая рука его была так тяжела, как будто двухпудовая гиря была привешана к ней. Он не мог бежать дальше. Француз остановился тоже и прицелился. Ростов зажмурился и нагнулся. Одна, другая пуля пролетела, жужжа, мимо него. Он собрал последние силы, взял левую руку в правую и побежал до кустов. В кустах были русские стрелки.","“That's right, our prisoner ... Yes. Will they take me too? What kind of people are these? Rostov kept thinking, not believing his eyes. ""Are they French?"" He looked at the approaching French, and despite the fact that in a second he galloped only to overtake these Frenchmen and cut them down, their proximity now seemed to him so terrible that he could not believe his eyes. ""Who are they? Why are they running? Really to me? Are they running towards me? And why? Kill me? Me, whom everyone loves so much? - He remembered the love of his mother, family, friends for him, and the intention of the enemies to kill him seemed impossible. “Maybe kill!” He stood for more than ten seconds, not moving from his place and not understanding his position. The hump-nosed Frenchman in front ran so close that you could already see the expression on his face. And the heated, alien physiognomy of this man, who, with a bayonet overweight, holding his breath, easily ran up to him, frightened Rostov. He grabbed a pistol and, instead of firing it, threw it at the Frenchman and ran towards the bushes with all his might. Not with that feeling of doubt and struggle with which he went to the Ensky bridge, he ran, but with the feeling of a hare running away from dogs. One inseparable feeling of fear for his young, happy life dominated his entire being. Quickly jumping over the fences, with the swiftness with which he ran, playing burners, he flew across the field, occasionally turning his pale, kind, young face, and a chill of horror ran down his back. ""No, it's better not to look,"" he thought, but, running up to the bushes, looked back again. The French lagged behind, and even at the moment he looked back, the one in front had just changed his trot to a walk and, turning around, was shouting something loudly to his comrade behind. Rostov stopped. ""Something's wrong,"" he thought, ""it can't be that they want to kill me."" Meanwhile, his left hand was so heavy, as if a two-pound weight was hung from it. He couldn't run any further. The Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rostov closed his eyes and bent down. One, another bullet flew, buzzing, past him. He gathered the last of his strength, took his left hand into his right and ran to the bushes. There were Russian arrows in the bushes.","“He must be one of ours taken prisoner ... Yes. Can it be they'll take me, too? What men are these?” Rostov kept thinking, not believing his eyes. “Can they be Frenchmen?” He looked at the approaching Frenchmen and, though a moment before he had been galloping only in order to meet these Frenchmen and cut them to pieces, their closeness now seemed so terrible to him that he could not believe his eyes. “Who are they? Why are they running? Can it be they're running to me? Can it be? And why? To kill me? Me, whom everybody loves so?” He remembered his mother's love for him, his family's, his friends', and the enemy's intention to kill him seemed impossible. “But maybe even—to kill me!” He stood for more than ten seconds without moving from the spot or understanding his situation. The first Frenchman with the hooked nose came so close that the expression on his face could already be seen. And the flushed alien physiognomy of this man who, with lowered bayonet, holding his breath, was running lightly towards him, frightened Rostov. He seized his pistol and, instead of firing it, threw it at the Frenchman, and ran for the bushes as fast as he could. He ran not with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had gone to the Enns bridge, but with the feeling of a hare escaping from hounds. One undivided feeling of fear for his young, happy life possessed his entire being. Quickly leaping over the hedges, with that swiftness with which he had run playing tag, he flew across the field, turning his pale, kind young face back from time to time, and a chill of terror ran down his spine. “No, it's better not to look,” he thought, but, running up to the bushes, he turned once more. The Frenchmen lagged behind, and even as he looked back, the front one had just changed his trot to a walk and, turning around, shouted something loudly to his comrade behind him. Rostov stopped. “Something must be wrong,” he thought, “it's impossible that they should want to kill me.” And meanwhile his left arm was as heavy as though a twenty-pound weight was hanging from it. He could not run any further. The Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rostov closed his eyes and crouched down. One, two bullets flew whistling past him. He gathered his last strength, held on to his left arm with his right hand, and ran to the bushes. In the bushes there were Russian riflemen.","‘It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will take me too? Who are these men?’ thought Rostov scarcely believing his eyes. ‘Can they be French?’ He looked at the approaching Frenchmen, and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe his eyes. ‘Who are they? Why are they running? Can they be coming at me? And why? To kill me? Me who everybody loves?’ He remembered his mother’s love for him, and his family’s, and his friends’, and the enemy’s intention to kill him seemed impossible. ‘ But perhaps they really will kill me!’ For more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation. The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was already so close that the expression of his face could be seen. And the excited, alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding his breath, and running so lightly, frightened Rostov. He seized his pistol, and instead of firing it flung it at the Frenchman and ran with all his might towards the bushes. He did not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge, but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One single emotion, that of fear for his young and happy life, possessed his whole being. Rapidly leaping the furrows he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at tag, now and then turning his good-natured, pale, young face to look back. A shudder of terror went through him: ‘No, better not look,’ he thought, but having reached the bushes he glanced round once more. The French had fallen behind, and just as he looked around the first man changed his run to a walk, and turning, shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back. Rostov paused. ‘ No, there’s some mistake,’ thought he. ‘They couldn’t really have wanted to kill me.’ But at the same time his left arm felt as heavy as if a five-stone weight were tied to it. He could run no more. The Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rostov closed his eyes and stooped down. One bullet and then another whistled past him. He mustered his last remaining strength, took hold of his left hand with his right and reached the bushes. Behind the bushes were some Russian sharpshooters."

"«Боже мой! что ж это такое? — думал Ростов. — И здесь, где всякую минуту государь может увидать их… Но нет, это, верно, только несколько мерзавцев. Это пройдет, это не то, это не может быть, — думал он. — Только поскорее, поскорее проехать их!»","""Oh my God! what is it? thought Rostov. - And here, where at any moment the sovereign can see them ... But no, these are, it’s true, only a few scoundrels. This will pass, this is not it, this cannot be, he thought. “Just hurry, hurry through them!”","“My God!

"Старый князь неторопливо одевался в кабинете, хмурясь и обдумывая то, что ему делать. Приезд этих гостей сердил его. «Что мне князь Василий и его сынок? Князь Василий хвастунишка, пустой, ну и сын хорош должен быть», ворчал он про себя. Его сердило то, что приезд этих гостей поднимал в его душе нерешенный, постоянно заглушаемый вопрос, — вопрос, насчет которого старый князь всегда сам себя обманывал. Вопрос состоял в том, решится ли он когда-либо расстаться с княжной Марьей и отдать ее мужу. Князь никогда прямо не решался задавать себе этот вопрос, зная вперед, что он ответил бы по справедливости, а справедливость противоречила больше чем чувству, а всей возможности его жизни. Жизнь без княжны Марьи князю Николаю Андреевичу, несмотря на то, что он, казалось, мало дорожил ею, была немыслима. «И к чему ей выходить замуж? — думал он, — наверно, быть несчастной. Вон Лиза за Андреем (лучше мужа теперь, кажется, трудно найти), а разве она довольна своей судьбой? И кто ее возьмет из любви? Дурна, неловка. Возьмут за связи, за богатство. И разве не живут в девках? Еще счастливее!» Так думал, одеваясь, князь Николай Андреевич, а вместе с тем всё откладываемый вопрос требовал немедленного решения. Князь Василий привез своего сына, очевидно, с намерением сделать предложение и, вероятно, нынче или завтра потребует прямого ответа. Имя, положение в свете приличное. «Что ж, я не прочь, — говорил сам себе князь, — но пусть он будет стоить ее. Вот это-то мы и посмотрим».","The old prince was leisurely dressing in his study, frowning and pondering what he should do. The arrival of these guests made him angry. “What is Prince Vasily and his son to me? Prince Vasily is a braggart, empty, well, a son should be good, ”he grumbled to himself. He was angry that the arrival of these guests raised in his soul an unresolved, constantly silenced question, a question about which the old prince had always deceived himself. The question was whether he would ever decide to part with Princess Mary and give her to her husband. The prince never directly dared to ask himself this question, knowing in advance that he would have answered fairly, and justice contradicted more than a feeling, but the whole possibility of his life. Life without Princess Mary to Prince Nikolai Andreevich, despite the fact that he seemed to value her little, was unthinkable. “And why should she marry? he thought, probably to be unhappy. Won Lisa after Andrei (it seems hard to find a better husband now), but is she satisfied with her fate? And who will take her out of love? Foolish, embarrassing. Take for connections, for wealth. And don't they live in girls? Even happier! So thought, dressing, Prince Nikolai Andreevich, and at the same time, the question that was being postponed all demanded an immediate solution. Prince Vasily brought his son, obviously with the intention of making an offer and, probably, today or tomorrow he will demand a direct answer. Name, position in the world decent. “Well, I don’t mind,” the prince said to himself, “but let him be worth it. That's what we'll see.""","The old prince was dressing unhurriedly in his study, frowning and thinking over what he was going to do. The arrival of these guests angered him. “What are Prince Vassily and his boy to me? Prince Vassily's an empty babbler, so the son must also be a fine one,” he grumbled to himself. He was angry because the arrival of these guests raised in his soul an unresolved, constantly stifled question—a question in regard to which the old prince always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever resolve to part with Princess Marya and give her to a husband. The prince had never ventured to ask himself this question directly, knowing beforehand that he would answer it in all fairness, and fairness contradicted more than feeling, it contradicted the whole possibility of his life. For Prince Nikolai Andreich, life without Princess Marya, despite the fact that he seemed to value her little, was unthinkable. “And why should she marry?” he thought. “She's sure to be unhappy. Liza's married to Andrei (a better husband would seem hard to find these days), but is she pleased with her fate? And who's going to take her out of love? She's plain, awkward. She'll be taken for her connections, for her wealth. Don't girls live unmarried? And all the happier!” So thought Prince Nikolai Andreich as he dressed, but at the same time the ever-deferred question called for immediate resolution. Prince Vassily had obviously brought his son with the intention of making a proposal, and would probably ask for a direct answer today or tomorrow. His name, his position in society were decent. “Well, I'm not against it,” the prince said to himself, “but he must be worthy of her. We'll see about that.”","The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. ‘What are Prince Vasili and that son of his to me? Prince Vasili is a shallow braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,’ he grumbled to himself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about which he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without Princess Marya, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to him. ‘ And why should she marry?’ he thought. ‘To be unhappy for certain. There’s Liza, married to Andrei—a better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadays—but is she contented with her lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! They’ll take her for her connections and wealth. Are there no women living unmarried, and even the happier for it?’ So thought Prince Bolkonsky while dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer. Prince Vasili had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. ‘ Well, I’ve nothing against it,’ the prince said to himself, ‘but he must be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see.’ ‘That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!’"

Вдруг, как широким веником, стегнуло что-то по эскадрону. Ростов поднял саблю, готовясь рубить, но в это время впереди скакавший солдат Никитенко отделился от него, и Ростов почувствовал, как во сне, что продолжает нестись с неестественною быстротой вперед и вместе с тем остается на месте. Сзади знакомый гусар Бандарчук наскакал на него и сердито посмотрел. Лошадь Бандарчука шарахнулась, и он обскакал мимо.","— Oh-oh-oh-ah-ah!! voices boomed. ""Well, now whoever gets caught,"" thought Rostov, pressing Grachik's spurs, and, overtaking the others, let him go all over the quarry. The enemy was already visible ahead. Suddenly, like a wide broom, something lashed the squadron. Rostov raised his saber, preparing to cut, but at that time the soldier Nikitenko, galloping ahead, separated from him, and Rostov felt, as in a dream, that he continued to rush forward with unnatural speed and at the same time remained in place. Behind him, the familiar hussar Bandarchuk galloped up at him and looked angrily. Bandarchuk's horse shied away, and he galloped past.","“Hur-r-ra-a-ah!” voices droned. “Well, now let anybody at all come along,” thought Rostov, spurring Little Rook and, outstripping the others, sending him into a full gallop. The enemy could already be seen ahead. Suddenly something lashed at the squadron as if with a broad besom. Rostov raised his sword, preparing to strike, but just then the soldier Nikitenko galloped past, leaving him behind, and Rostov felt, as in a dream, that he was still racing on with unnatural speed and at the same time was staying in place. The familiar hussar Bandarchuk galloped towards him from behind and looked at him angrily. Bandarchuk's horse shied, and he swerved around him.","‘Hurr-a-a-a-ah!’ came a roar of voices. ‘Let anyone come my way now,’ thought Rostov driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go at full gallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead the enemy was already visible. Suddenly something like a birch-broom seemed to sweep over the squadron. Rostov raised his sabre ready to strike, but at that instant the trooper Nikitenko who was galloping ahead, shot away from him, and Rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From behind him Bondarchuk, a hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked at him angrily. Bondarchuk’s horse swerved and galloped past."

"— Борис! — сказала она сыну и улыбнулась, — я пройду к графу, к дяде, а ты поди к Пьеру, mon ami, покамест, да не забудь передать ему приглашение от Ростовых. Они зовут его обедать. Я думаю, он не поедет? — обратилась она к князю.","— Boris! she said to her son and smiled, “I’ll go to the count, to my uncle, and you go to Pierre, mon ami, for the time being, don’t forget to give him an invitation from the Rostovs.” They invite him to dinner. I don't think he will? she turned to the prince.","“Boris!” she said to her son and smiled. “I'll go to the count, my uncle, and meanwhile you go to Pierre, mon ami, and don't forget to convey to him the invitation from the Rostovs. They're inviting him to dinner. He won't go, I suppose?” she turned to the prince.","‘Boris,’ she said to her son with a smile, ‘I shall go in to see the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile and don’t forget to give him the Rostovs’ invitation.

"Но Борис, заметив, что Ростов сбирался посмеяться над Бергом, искусно отклонил разговор. Он попросил Ростова рассказать о том, как и где он получил рану. Ростову это было приятно, и он начал рассказывать, во время рассказа всё более и более одушевляясь. Он рассказал им свое Шенграбенское дело совершенно так, как обыкновенно рассказывают про сражения участвовавшие в них, то есть так, как им хотелось бы, чтобы оно было, так, как они слыхали от других рассказчиков, так, как красивее было рассказывать, но совершенно не так, как оно было. Ростов был правдивый молодой человек, он ни за что умышленно не сказал бы неправды. Он начал рассказывать с намерением рассказать всё, как оно точно было, но незаметно, невольно и неизбежно для себя перешел в неправду. Ежели бы он рассказал правду этим слушателям, которые, как и он сам, слышали уже множество раз рассказы об атаках и составили себе определенное понятие о том, что такое была атака, и ожидали точно такого же рассказа, — или бы они не поверили ему, или, что еще хуже, подумали бы, что Ростов был сам виноват в том, что с ним не случилось того, что случается обыкновенно с рассказчиками кавалерийских атак. Не мог он им рассказать так просто, что поехали все рысью, он упал с лошади, свихнул руку и изо всех сил побежал в лес от француза. Кроме того, для того чтобы рассказать всё, как было, надо было сделать усилие над собой, чтобы рассказать только то, что было. Рассказать правду очень трудно; и молодые люди редко на это способны. Они ждали рассказа о том, как горел он весь в огне, сам себя не помня, как буря, налетал на каре; как врубался в него, рубил направо и налево; как сабля отведала мяса, и как он падал в изнеможении, и тому подобное. И он рассказал им всё это.","But Boris, noticing that Rostov was going to laugh at Berg, artfully dismissed the conversation. He asked Rostov to tell how and where he received the wound. Rostov was pleased, and he began to tell, during the story he became more and more animated. He told them his Shengraben affair in exactly the same way as those who took part in them usually tell about the battles, that is, the way they would like it to be, the way they heard from other storytellers, the way it was more beautiful to tell, but not at all. the way it was. Rostov was a truthful young man; he would never deliberately tell a lie. He began to tell with the intention of telling everything exactly as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily and inevitably for himself, he turned into a lie. If he had told the truth to these listeners, who, like himself, had already heard stories of attacks many times and formed a definite idea of what an attack was, and expected exactly the same story - or they would not believe him, or, even worse, they would think that Rostov himself was to blame for the fact that what happened to him did not happen to him, which usually happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks. He could not tell them so simply that they all went at a trot, he fell off his horse, lost his arm and ran with all his might into the forest from the Frenchman. In addition, in order to tell everything as it happened, one had to make an effort on oneself to tell only what happened. Telling the truth is very difficult; and young people are rarely capable of it. They were waiting for a story about how he was on fire all over, not remembering himself, like a storm, he flew on a square; how he cut into him, chopped right and left; how the saber tasted the meat, and how he fell exhausted, and the like. And he told them all this.","But Boris, noticing that Rostov was preparing to make fun of Berg, artfully diverted the conversation. He asked Rostov to tell them how and where he had received his wound. This pleased Rostov, and he began telling the story, growing more and more animated as it went on. He told them about his Schöngraben action in just the way that those who take part in battles usually tell about them, that is, in the way they would like it to have been, the way they have heard others tell it, the way it could be told more beautifully, but not at all the way it had been. Rostov was a truthful young man, not for anything would he have deliberately told an untruth. He began telling the story with the intention of telling it exactly as it had been, but imperceptibly, involuntarily, and inevitably for himself, he went over into untruth. If he had told the truth to these listeners, who, like himself, had already heard accounts of attacks numerous times and had formed for themselves a definite notion of what an attack was, and were expecting exactly the same sort of account—they either would not have believed him or, worse still, would have thought it was Rostov's own fault that what usually happens in stories of cavalry attacks had not happened with him. He could not simply tell them that they all set out at a trot, he fell off his horse, dislocated his arm, and ran to the woods as fast as he could to escape a Frenchman. Besides, in order to tell everything as it had been, one would have to make an effort with oneself so as to tell only what had been. To tell the truth is very difficult, and young men are rarely capable of it. They were expecting an account of how he got all fired up, forgetting himself, how he flew like a storm at the square; how he cut his way into it, hacking right and left; how his saber tasted flesh, how he fell exhausted, and so on. And he told them all that.","But Boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and skilfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and where he got his wound. This pleased Rostov and he began talking about it, and as he went on became more and more animated. He told them of his Schön Grabern affair just as those who have taken part in a battle generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been, as they have heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not at all as it really was. Rostov was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie. He began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily, and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood. If he had told the truth to his hearers—who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a story—they would either not have believed him or, still worse, would have thought that Rostov was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him. He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot, and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman into the wood. Besides, to tell everything as it really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth, and young people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his sabre had tasted flesh, and he had fallen exhausted, and so on. And so he told them all that."

"[Милый и бесценный друг. Ваше письмо от 13-го доставило мне большую радость. Вы всё еще меня любите, моя поэтическая Юлия. Разлука, о которой вы говорите так много дурного, видно, не имела на вас своего обычного влияния. Вы жалуетесь на разлуку, что же я должна была бы сказать, если бы смела, — я, лишенная всех тех, кто мне дорог? Ах, ежели бы не было у нас религии для утешения, жизнь была бы очень печальна. Почему приписываете вы мне строгий взгляд, когда говорите о вашей склонности к молодому человеку? В этом отношении я строга только к себе. Я понимаю эти чувства у других, и если не могу одобрять их, никогда не испытавши, то и не осуждаю их. Мне кажется только, что христианская любовь, любовь к ближнему, любовь к врагам, достойнее, слаще и лучше, чем те чувства, которые могут внушить прекрасные глаза молодого человека молодой девушке, поэтической и любящей, как вы.","[Dear and priceless friend. Your letter of the 13th brought me great joy. You still love me, my poetic Julia. The separation, of which you speak so many evil things, apparently did not have its usual influence on you. You complain about separation, what would I have to say if I dared - I, deprived of all those who are dear to me? Ah, if we did not have a religion to console us, life would be very sad. Why do you attribute a stern look to me when you speak of your inclination towards a young man? In this regard, I am only strict with myself. I understand these feelings in others, and if I cannot approve of them, having never experienced them, then I do not condemn them. It only seems to me that Christian love, love for one's neighbor, love for one's enemies, is more worthy, sweeter and better than those feelings that the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a young girl, poetic and loving, like you.","“Ah, vous expédiez le courrier, princesse, moi j'ai déjà expédié le mien.

"Князь Багратион, выехав на самый высокий пункт нашего правого фланга, стал спускаться книзу, где слышалась перекатная стрельба и ничего не видно было от порохового дыма. Чем ближе они спускались к лощине, тем менее им становилось видно, но тем чувствительнее становилась близость самого настоящего поля сражения. Им стали встречаться раненые. Одного с окровавленной головой, без шапки, тащили двое солдат под руки. Он хрипел и плевал. Пуля попала, видно, в рот или в горло. Другой, встретившийся им, бодро шел один, без ружья, громко охая и махая от свежей боли рукою, из которой кровь лилась, как из стклянки, на его шинель. Лицо его казалось больше испуганным, чем страдающим. Он минуту тому назад был ранен. Переехав дорогу, они стали круто спускаться и на спуске увидали несколько человек, которые лежали; им встретилась толпа солдат, в числе которых были и не раненые. Солдаты шли в гору, тяжело дыша, и, несмотря на вид генерала, громко разговаривали и махали руками. Впереди, в дыму, уже были видны ряды серых шинелей, и офицер, увидав Багратиона, с криком побежал за солдатами, шедшими толпой, требуя, чтоб они воротились. Багратион подъехал к рядам, по которым то там, то здесь быстро щелкали выстрелы, заглушая говор и командные крики. Весь воздух пропитан был пороховым дымом. Лица солдат все были закопчены порохом и оживлены. Иные забивали шомполами, другие посыпали на полки, доставали заряды из сумок, третьи стреляли. Но в кого они стреляли, этого не было видно от порохового дыма, не уносимого ветром. Довольно часто слышались приятные звуки жужжанья и свистения. «Что это такое? — думал князь Андрей, подъезжая к этой толпе солдат. — Это не может быть атака, потому что они не двигаются; не может быть карре: они не так стоят».","Prince Bagration, riding out to the highest point of our right flank, began to descend, where erratic shooting was heard and nothing was visible from the powder smoke. The closer they descended to the hollow, the less they could see, but the more sensitive became the proximity of the real battlefield itself. They began to meet the wounded. One with a bloody head, without a hat, was dragged by two soldiers by the arms. He wheezed and spat. The bullet hit, apparently, in the mouth or throat. Another, whom he met, walked briskly alone, without a gun, groaning loudly and waving his hand in fresh pain, from which blood was pouring, like from a glass, onto his overcoat. His face looked more frightened than hurt. He was wounded a minute ago. Having crossed the road, they began to descend steeply and on the descent they saw several people who were lying; they met a crowd of soldiers, some of whom were not wounded. The soldiers walked uphill, breathing heavily, and, despite the appearance of the general, they talked loudly and waved their hands. Ahead, in the smoke, rows of gray overcoats were already visible, and the officer, seeing Bagration, ran screaming after the soldiers marching in a crowd, demanding that they return. Bagration rode up to the ranks, along which here and there shots quickly clicked, drowning out the conversation and shouts of command. All the air was saturated with gunpowder smoke. The faces of the soldiers were all smoked with gunpowder and animated. Others beat them with ramrods, others sprinkled them on the shelves, took out charges from their bags, and still others fired. But whom they were shooting at, this was not visible from the powder smoke, which was not carried away by the wind. Quite often, pleasant sounds of buzzing and whistling were heard. ""What it is? - thought Prince Andrei, driving up to this crowd of soldiers. - It can't be an attack because they don't move; there can't be carre: they don't cost that much.""","Prince Bagration, having ridden to the highest point on our right flank, started down to where rolling gunfire could be heard and nothing could be seen through the powder smoke. The further they descended into the hollow, the less they could see, but the more they could sense the nearness of the actual battlefield. They began to meet the wounded. One with a bloodied head, hat-less, was being dragged under the arms by two soldiers. He gurgled and spat. The bullet seemed to have hit him in the mouth or the throat. Another came towards them, walking briskly by himself, without his musket, groaning loudly and waving his arm from the fresh pain, while blood poured over his greatcoat as if from a flask. His face showed more fear than suffering. He had been wounded a moment before. Crossing the road, they began a steep descent and on the slope saw several men who were lying down; they met a crowd of soldiers, some of whom were not wounded. The soldiers were walking up the hill, breathing heavily and, though they saw the general, were talking loudly and waving their arms. Ahead, in the smoke, lines of gray greatcoats could now be seen, and an officer, catching sight of Bagration, ran shouting after the soldiers walking in a crowd, demanding that they turn back. Bagration rode up to the lines, along which there was here and there a rapid crackle of gunfire, drowning out talk and shouts of command. The air was completely saturated with powder smoke. The soldiers' faces were all smudged with powder and animated. Some tamped down with ramrods, others primed the pans and took shot from their pouches, still others fired. But who they were firing at could not be seen owing to the smoke, which there was no wind to scatter. Pleasant buzzing and whistling noises were heard rather often. “What's that?” thought Prince Andrei, riding up to the crowd of soldiers. “It can't be a line, because they're in a bunch! It can't be an attack, because they're not moving; it can't be a square: they're not standing right.”","PRINCE BAGRATION, having reached the highest point of our right flank, began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen. The nearer they got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the actual battlefield. They began to meet wounded men. One with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or mouth. Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket, groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle. He had that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering. Crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground, they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded. The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and despite the general’s presence were talking loudly and gesticulating. In front of them rows of grey cloaks were already visible through the smoke, and an officer catching sight of Bagration rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back. Bagration rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, drowning the sound of voices and the shouts of command. The whole air reeked with smoke. The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it. Some were using their ramrods, others putting powder on the touch-pans or taking charges from their pouches, while others were firing, though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away. A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets was often heard. ‘What is this?’ thought Prince Andrei approaching the crowd of soldiers. ‘It can’t be an attack for they are not moving; it can’t be a square—for they are not drawn up for that.’"

"Пьер, ничего не понимая и молча, застенчиво краснея, смотрел на княгиню Анну Михайловну. Переговорив с Пьером, Анна Михайловна уехала к Ростовым и легла спать. Проснувшись утром, она рассказывала Ростовым и всем знакомым подробности смерти графа Безухого. Она говорила, что граф умер так, как и она желала бы умереть, что конец его был не только трогателен, но и назидателен; последнее же свидание отца с сыном было до того трогательно, что она не могла вспомнить его без слез, и что она не знает, — кто лучше вел себя в эти страшные минуты: отец ли, который так всё и всех вспомнил в последние минуты и такие трогательные слова сказал сыну, или Пьер, на которого жалко было смотреть, как он был убит и как, несмотря на это, старался скрыть свою печаль, чтобы не огорчить умирающего отца. «C'est penible, mais cela fait du bien; ca eleve l'ame de voir des hommes, comme le vieux comte et son digne fils», [Это тяжело, но это спасительно; душа возвышается, когда видишь таких людей, как старый граф и его достойный сын, ] говорила она. О поступках княжны и князя Василья она, не одобряя их, тоже рассказывала, но под большим секретом и шопотом.","Pierre, not understanding anything and silently, blushing shyly, looked at Princess Anna Mikhailovna. After talking with Pierre, Anna Mikhailovna went to the Rostovs and went to bed. Waking up in the morning, she told the Rostovs and everyone she knew the details of the death of Count Bezukhy. She said that the count died the way she would have wished to die, that his end was not only touching, but also instructive; the last meeting between father and son was so touching that she could not remember it without tears, and that she did not know who behaved better in these terrible moments: whether the father, who remembered everything and everyone in such a way in the last minutes and such he said touching words to his son, or Pierre, whom it was a pity to look at how he was killed and how, despite this, he tried to hide his sadness so as not to upset his dying father. ""C'est penible, mais cela fait du bien; ca eleve l'ame de voir des hommes, comme le vieux comte et son digne fils"", [It's hard, but it's saving; the soul rises when one sees such people as the old earl and his worthy son,] she said.

She said that the count had died as she would like to die, that his end had been not only touching, but also instructive; and the last meeting of the father and son had been so touching that she could not recall it without tears, and that she did not know who had behaved better in those terrible moments: the father, who remembered everything and everyone so well in the last minutes and said such touching things to the son; or Pierre, who was a pity to see, he was so crushed, but who nevertheless tried to hide his sorrow, so as not to upset his dying father. “C'est pénible, mais cela fait du bien; ça élève l'âme de voir des hommes comme le vieux comte et son digne fils,”[146] she said. She also told disapprovingly about the actions of the princess and Prince Vassily, but as a great secret and in a whisper.","Pierre understood nothing of all this and colouring shyly looked in silence at Princess Anna Mikhailovna.

Of the behaviour of the eldest princess and Prince Vasili she spoke disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret."

"В это время позади Кутузова послышались вдали звуки здоровающихся полков, и голоса эти стали быстро приближаться по всему протяжению растянувшейся линии наступавших русских колонн. Видно было, что тот, с кем здоровались, ехал скоро. Когда закричали солдаты того полка, перед которым стоял Кутузов, он отъехал несколько в сторону и сморщившись оглянулся. По дороге из Працена скакал как бы эскадрон разноцветных всадников. Два из них крупным галопом скакали рядом впереди остальных. Один был в черном мундире с белым султаном на рыжей энглизированной лошади, другой в белом мундире на вороной лошади. Это были два императора со свитой. Кутузов, с аффектацией служаки, находящегося во фронте, скомандовал «смирно» стоявшим войскам и, салютуя, подъехал к императору. Вся его фигура и манера вдруг изменились. Он принял вид подначальственного, нерассуждающего человека. Он с аффектацией почтительности, которая, очевидно, неприятно поразила императора Александра, подъехал и салютовал ему.","At this time, behind Kutuzov, the sounds of greeting regiments were heard in the distance, and these voices began to quickly approach along the entire length of the stretched line of advancing Russian columns. It was evident that the one with whom they greeted was driving quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment in front of which Kutuzov stood shouted, he drove a little to the side and looked around with a frown. On the road from Pracen, a squadron of multicolored horsemen galloped, as it were. Two of them galloped side by side ahead of the rest. One was in a black uniform with a white plume on a red english horse, the other in a white uniform on a black horse. These were two emperors with retinue. Kutuzov, with the affectation of a campaigner at the front, commanded the troops standing at attention and, saluting, rode up to the emperor. His whole figure and manner suddenly changed. He took on the appearance of a subordinate, unreasoning person. He, with an affectation of deference, which obviously struck the Emperor Alexander unpleasantly, rode up and saluted him.","Just then, from well behind Kutuzov, came shouts of regimental greetings, and these voices began to approach quickly along the whole extended line of the advancing Russian columns. It was clear that the one being greeted was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment Kutuzov was standing in front of began to shout, he rode slightly to one side and, wincing, turned to look. Down the road from Pratz galloped what looked like a squadron of varicolored horsemen. Two of them rode side by side at a great gallop ahead of the rest. One, in a black uniform with white plumes, rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other, in a white uniform, rode a black horse. These were the two emperors with their suite. Kutuzov, with the affectation of a frontline veteran, ordered his standing troops to “attention” and, saluting, rode up to the emperor. His whole figure and manner suddenly changed. He acquired the look of a subordinate, unthinking man. With affected deference, which obviously struck the emperor Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted him.","Just then at a distance behind Kutuzov was heard the sound of regiments saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended line of the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person they were greeting was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment in front of which Kutuzov was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown. Along the road from Pratzen galloped what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them rode side by side in front, at full gallop. One in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bob-tailed chestnut horse, the other who was in a white uniform, rode a black one. These were the two Emperors* followed by their suites. Kutuzov, affecting the manners of an old soldier at the front, gave the command ‘Attention!’ and rode up to the Emperors with a salute. His whole appearance and manner was suddenly transformed. He put on the air of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning. With an affectation of respect which evidently struck Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted."

"Гвардия весь поход прошла, как на гуляньи, щеголяя своей чистотой и дисциплиной. Переходы были малые, ранцы везли на подводах, офицерам австрийское начальство готовило на всех переходах прекрасные обеды. Полки вступали и выступали из городов с музыкой, и весь поход (чем гордились гвардейцы), по приказанию великого князя, люди шли в ногу, а офицеры пешком на своих местах. Борис всё время похода шел и стоял с Бергом, теперь уже ротным командиром. Берг, во время похода получив роту, успел своей исполнительностью и аккуратностью заслужить доверие начальства и устроил весьма выгодно свои экономические дела; Борис во время похода сделал много знакомств с людьми, которые могли быть ему полезными, и через рекомендательное письмо, привезенное им от Пьера, познакомился с князем Андреем Болконским, через которого он надеялся получить место в штабе главнокомандующего. Берг и Борис, чисто и аккуратно одетые, отдохнув после последнего дневного перехода, сидели в чистой отведенной им квартире перед круглым столом и играли в шахматы. Берг держал между колен курящуюся трубочку. Борис, с свойственной ему аккуратностью, белыми тонкими руками пирамидкой уставлял шашки, ожидая хода Берга, и глядел на лицо своего партнера, видимо думая об игре, как он и всегда думал только о том, чем он был занят.","The guards went through the entire campaign as if on a festivities, flaunting their cleanliness and discipline. The transitions were small, satchels were carried on carts, the Austrian authorities prepared excellent dinners for the officers at all the transitions. The regiments entered and left the cities with music, and the whole campaign (which the guardsmen were proud of), by order of the Grand Duke, people walked in step, and the officers walked in their places. Boris walked and stood with Berg, now a company commander, all the time of the campaign. Berg, having received a company during the campaign, managed to earn the trust of his superiors with his diligence and accuracy and arranged his economic affairs very profitably; During the campaign, Boris made many acquaintances with people who could be useful to him, and through a letter of recommendation he brought from Pierre, he met Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, through whom he hoped to get a place in the headquarters of the commander in chief. Berg and Boris, neatly and neatly dressed, having rested after the last day's march, sat in the clean apartment allotted to them in front of a round table and played chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees. Boris, with his usual accuracy, with his white thin hands placed the checkers like a pyramid, waiting for Berg's move, and looked at his partner's face, apparently thinking about the game, as he always thought only about what he was doing.","The guards had made the whole march as if on a promenade, showing off their cleanness and discipline.

Berg, who had obtained the company during the march, had managed by his efficiency and neatness to earn the confidence of his superiors, and had arranged his financial affairs rather profitably; Boris had made many acquaintances during the march with people who could be useful to him, and, through a letter of recommendation brought to him from Pierre, had become acquainted with Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, through whom he hoped to get a post on the commander in chief's staff.

Berg was holding a smoking little pipe between his knees.

Boris had been quartered, and had marched all the way, with Berg who was already in command of a company. Berg, who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very satisfactorily. Boris during the campaign had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him, and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre, had become acquainted with Prince Andrei Bolkonsky through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander-in-chief’s staff. Berg and Boris having rested after yesterday’s march, were sitting, clean and neatly dressed at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them, playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees.

Вскоре после вечера Анны Павловны Анна Михайловна вернулась в Москву, прямо к своим богатым родственникам Ростовым, у которых она стояла в Москве и у которых с детства воспитывался и годами живал ее обожаемый Боренька, только что произведенный в армейские и тотчас же переведенный в гвардейские прапорщики.

Shortly after Anna Pavlovna's evening, Anna Mikhailovna returned to Moscow, directly to her wealthy relatives, the Rostovs, with whom she stayed in Moscow and with whom her adored Borenka, who had just been promoted to the army and immediately transferred to the guards warrant officers, was brought up and lived for years.

But Boris was not to be appointed adjutant or attaché to Kutuzov, despite all Anna Mikhailovna's soliciting and scheming. Soon after Anna Pavlovna's soirée, Anna Mikhailovna returned to Moscow, straight to her rich relations, the Rostovs, with whom she stayed in Moscow, and with whom her adored Borenka, just made an ensign in the army and transferred to the guards, had been brought up and had lived for years.

The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception made, and Boris transferred into the regiment of Semyonov Guards with the rank of cornet. * He received however no appointment to Kutuzov’s staff despite all Anna Mikhailovna’s endeavours and entreaties. Soon after Anna Pavlovna’s reception Anna Mikhailovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations the Rostovs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling Borenka, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had already left Petersburg on the 10th of August, and her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to Radzivilov."

Багратион знал, что, по расстоянию почти 10-ти верст, отделявшему один фланг от другого, ежели не убьют того, кого пошлют (что было очень вероятно), и ежели он даже и найдет главнокомандующего, что было весьма трудно, посланный не успеет вернуться раньше вечера.","On the right flank at Bagration at 9 o'clock, the matter had not yet begun. Not wanting to agree to Dolgorukov's demand to start a business and wanting to deflect responsibility from himself, Prince Bagration suggested that Dolgorukov send the commander in chief to ask about it. Bagration knew that, at a distance of almost 10 miles, separating one flank from the other, if they did not kill the one who was sent (which was very likely), and if he even found the commander in chief, which was very difficult, the sent one would not have time to return before evening.","At nine o'clock, the action had not yet begun for Bagration on the right flank. Not wishing to agree to Dolgorukov's request to begin action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself, Prince Bagration suggested to Dolgorukov that he send to ask the commander in chief. Bagration knew that, with a stretch of nearly six miles separating one flank from the other, if the messenger was not killed (which was very probable), and even if he found the commander in chief, which would be quite difficult, he would not come back before evening.","ON our right flank commanded by Bagration, at nine o’clock the battle had not yet begun. Not wishing to agree to Dolgorukov ’s demand to commence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself, Prince Bagration proposed to Dolgorukov to send to inquire of the commander-in-chief. Bagration knew that as the distance between the two flanks was more than six miles, even if the messenger were not killed (which he very likely would be), and found the commander-in-chief (which would be very difficult), he would not be able to get back before evening."
"— Потому и не начинаю, государь, — сказал звучным голосом Кутузов, как бы предупреждая возможность не быть расслышанным, и в лице его еще раз что-то дрогнуло. — Потому и не начинаю, государь, что мы не на параде и не на Царицыном лугу, — выговорил он ясно и отчетливо.","“That’s why I don’t start, sir,” Kutuzov said in a sonorous voice, as if warning the possibility of not being heard, and something trembled in his face again. “That’s why I don’t start, sir, because we are not at the parade and not on the Tsaritsy’s Meadow,” he said clearly and distinctly.","“That is just why I do not begin, Sire,” Kutuzov said in a ringing voice, as if to forestall the possibility of not being heard, and again something twitched in his face. “I do not begin, Sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Tsaritsyn Field,” he uttered clearly and distinctly.","‘That is just why I do not begin, sire,’ said Kutuzov in a resounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard, and again something in his face twitched—‘That is just why I do not begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Tsaritsyn Field,’ said he clearly and distinctly."

"Несмотря на то, что Анатоль в женском обществе ставил себя обыкновенно в положение человека, которому надоедала беготня за ним женщин, он чувствовал тщеславное удовольствие, видя свое влияние на этих трех женщин.

Для этой цели необходимо… Первая колонна марширует… вторая колонна марширует… третья колонна марширует…] и т. д., читал Вейротер. Генералы, казалось, неохотно слушали трудную диспозицию. Белокурый высокий генерал Буксгевден стоял, прислонившись спиною к стене, и, остановив свои глаза на горевшей свече, казалось, не слушал и даже не хотел, чтобы думали, что он слушает. Прямо против Вейротера, устремив на него свои блестящие открытые глаза, в воинственной позе, оперев руки с вытянутыми наружу локтями на колени, сидел румяный Милорадович с приподнятыми усами и плечами. Он упорно молчал, глядя в лицо Вейротера, и спускал с него глаза только в то время, когда австрийский начальник штаба замолкал. В это время Милорадович значительно оглядывался на других генералов. Но по значению этого значительного взгляда нельзя было понять, был ли он согласен или несогласен, доволен или недоволен диспозицией. Ближе всех к Вейротеру сидел граф Ланжерон и с тонкой улыбкой южного французского лица, не покидавшей его во всё время чтения, глядел на свои тонкие пальцы, быстро перевертывавшие за углы золотую табакерку с портретом. В середине одного из длиннейших периодов он остановил вращательное движение табакерки, поднял голову и с неприятною учтивостью на самых концах тонких губ перебил Вейротера и хотел сказать что-то; но австрийский генерал, не прерывая чтения, сердито нахмурился и замахал локтями, как бы говоря: потом, потом вы мне скажете свои мысли, теперь извольте смотреть на карту и слушать. Ланжерон поднял глаза кверху с выражением недоумения, оглянулся на Милорадовича, как бы ища объяснения, но, встретив значительный, ничего не значущий взгляд Милорадовича, грустно опустил глаза и опять принялся вертеть табакерку.","Da der Feind mit seinerien linken Fluegel an die mit Wald bedeckten Berge lehnt und sich mit seinerien rechten Fluegel laengs Kobeinitz und Sokolienitz hinter die dort befindIichen Teiche zieht, wir im Gegentheil mit unserem linken Fluegel seinen rechten sehr debordiren, so ist es vortheilhaft let des Fluegel Feindes zu attakiren, besondere wenn wir die Doerfer Sokolienitz und Kobelienitz im Besitze haben, wodurch wir dem Feind zugleich in die Flanke fallen und ihn auf der Flaeche zwischen Schlapanitz und dem Thuerassa-Walde verfolgen koennen, indem wir dem Defileen von Schlapanitz und Bellhenitz aus, welche die feindliche Front decken.

For this purpose it is necessary... The first column is marching... the second column is marching... the third column is marching...], etc., read Weyrother. The generals seemed reluctant to listen to the difficult disposition. The blond tall General Buxhoeveden stood with his back against the wall, and, fixing his eyes on the burning candle, did not seem to be listening and did not even want to be thought that he was listening. Directly opposite Weyrother, with his shining open eyes fixed on him, in a warlike pose, with his hands resting on his knees with outstretched elbows, sat a ruddy Miloradovich with upturned mustaches and shoulders. He was stubbornly silent, looking into Weyrother's face, and took his eyes off him only at the time when the Austrian chief of staff fell silent. At this time, Miloradovich significantly looked back at the other generals. But from the significance of this significant look it was impossible to understand whether he agreed or disagreed, satisfied or dissatisfied with the disposition. Closest to Weyrother sat Count Lanzheron, and with a thin smile on his southern French face, which did not leave him during the entire reading, he looked at his thin fingers, quickly turning over the corners of a golden snuffbox with a portrait. In the middle of one of the longest periods, he stopped the revolving movement of the snuffbox, raised his head and, with unpleasant courtesy at the very ends of his thin lips, interrupted Weyrother and wanted to say something; but the Austrian general, without interrupting his reading, frowned angrily and waved his elbows, as if to say: later, later you will tell me your thoughts, now if you please look at the map and listen. Langeron raised his eyes upward with an expression of bewilderment, looked back at Miloradovich, as if seeking an explanation, but, meeting Miloradovich's significant, meaningless look, sadly lowered his eyes and again began to turn the snuffbox.","Da der Feind mit seinem linken Flügel an die mit Wald bedeckten Berge lehnt und sich mit seinem rechten Flügel längs Kobelnitz und Sokolnitz hinter die dort befindlichen Teiche zieht, wir im Gegenteil mit unserem linken Flügel seinen rechten sehr debordieren, so ist es vorteilhaft letzteren Flügel des Feindes zu attakieren , besonders wenn wir die Dörfer Sokolnitz und Kobelnitz im Besitze haben, wodurch wir dem Feind zugleich in die Flanke fallen und ihn auf der Fläche zwischen Schlapa-nitz und dem Thuerassa-Walde verfolgen können, indem wir dem Defi-leen von Schlapanitz und Bellowitz ausweichen, welche die feindliche Front decken. Zu diesem Endzwecke ist es nötig ... die erste Kolonne marschiert. . . die zweite Kolonne marschiert. . . die dritte Kolonne marschiert...”[266] and so on, read Weyrother. The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult disposition. The tall, fair-haired General Buxhöwden stood leaning his back against the wall, and, resting his eyes on the burning candle, seemed not to be listening and even not to want it to be thought that he was listening. Directly opposite Weyrother, fixing his shining, wide-open eyes on him, in a martial pose, hands on his knees, elbows turned out, sat ruddy Miloradovich, with raised-up mustache and shoulders. He was obstinately silent, staring into Weyrother's face, and took his eyes off him only when the Austrian chief of staff fell silent. Then Miloradovich looked around significantly at the other generals. But by the significance of this significant gaze it was impossible to tell whether he agreed or disagreed, was satisfied or dissatisfied with the disposition. Closest of all to Weyrother, Count Langeron sat and, with a subtle smile on his southern French face, which did not abandon him throughout the reading, gazed at his slender fingers, quickly twirling by the corners a golden snuffbox with a portrait. In the middle of one of the longest periods, he stopped the spinning movement of the snuffbox, raised his head, and, with an unpleasant politeness at the very corners of his thin lips, interrupted Weyrother and wanted to say something; but the Austrian general, without breaking off his reading, frowned angrily and waved his elbows, as if to say: later, later you can tell me your thoughts, but now kindly look at the map and listen. Langeron looked up with an expression of perplexity, glanced at Miloradovich as if seeking an explanation, but, meeting Miloradovich's significant gaze, which signified nothing, he sadly lowered his eyes and again began twirling the snuffbox.","Da der Feind mit seinem linken Flügel an die mit Wald bedeckten Berge lehnt und sich mit seinem rechten Flügel längs Kobelnitz und Sokolnitz hinter die dort befindlichen Teiche zieht, wir im Gegenteil mit unserem linken Flügel seinen rechten sehr debordieren, so ist es vorteilhaft, letzteren Flügel des Feindes zu attakkieren, besonders wenn wir die Dörfer Sokolnitz und Kobelnitz im Bezitze haben, wodurch wir dem Feind zugleich in die Flanke fallen und ihn auf der Fläche zwischen Schlapanitz und dem Thuerassa-Walde verfolgen können, indem wir dem Defileen von Schlapanitz und Bellowitz ausweichen, welche die feindliche Front decken. Zu diesem Endzwecke ist es nötig … Die erste Kolonne marschiert … die zweite Kolonne marschiert … die dritte Kolonne marschiert …’ 1 And so on, read Weyrother. The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions. The tall fair-haired General Buxhöwden stood leaning his back against the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen nor even to wish to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite Weyrother, with his glistening wide-open eyes fixed upon him and his moustache twisted upwards, sat the ruddy Miloradovich in a military pose, his elbows turned outwards, his hands on his knees, and his shoulders raised. He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Weyrother’s face, and only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief-of-staff finished reading. Then Miloradovich looked round significantly at the other generals. But one could not tell from that significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements. Next to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading, gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a gold snuff-box on which was a portrait. In the middle of one of the longest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuff-box, raised his head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips, interrupted Weyrother wishing to say something. But the Austrian general continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his elbows, as if to say: ‘You can tell me your views later, but now be so good as to look at the map and listen.’ Langeron lifted his eyes with an expression of perplexity, turned round to Miloradovich as if seeking an explanation, but meeting the latter’s impressive but meaningless gaze, drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuff-box."

"Ростов дал шпоры лошади, окликнул унтер-офицера Федченку и еще двух гусар, приказал им ехать за собою и рысью поехал под гору по направлению к продолжавшимся крикам. Ростову и жутко и весело было ехать одному с тремя гусарами туда, в эту таинственную и опасную туманную даль, где никто не был прежде его. Багратион закричал ему с горы, чтобы он не ездил дальше ручья, но Ростов сделал вид, как будто не слыхал его слов, и, не останавливаясь, ехал дальше и дальше, беспрестанно обманываясь, принимая кусты за деревья и рытвины за людей и беспрестанно объясняя свои обманы. Спустившись рысью под гору, он уже не видал ни наших, ни неприятельских огней, но громче, яснее слышал крики французов. В лощине он увидал перед собой что-то вроде реки, но когда он доехал до нее, он узнал проезженную дорогу. Выехав на дорогу, он придержал лошадь в нерешительности: ехать по ней, или пересечь ее и ехать по черному полю в гору. Ехать по светлевшей в тумане дороге было безопаснее, потому что скорее можно было рассмотреть людей. «Пошел за мной», проговорил он, пересек дорогу и стал подниматься галопом на гору, к тому месту, где с вечера стоял французский пикет.","Rostov spurred his horse, called out to non-commissioned officer Fedchenko and two more hussars, ordered them to follow him, and rode at a trot downhill in the direction of the continuing screams. Rostov was both terribly and merrily to go alone with three hussars there, to this mysterious and dangerous foggy distance, where no one had been before him. Bagration shouted to him from the mountain so that he would not go further than the stream, but Rostov pretended not to hear his words, and, without stopping, rode on and on, constantly deceived, mistaking bushes for trees and potholes for people and constantly explaining his deceptions. Having trotted downhill, he no longer saw either ours or the enemy's fires, but he heard the cries of the French louder and clearer. In the hollow he saw something like a river in front of him, but when he reached it, he recognized a well-trodden road. Riding out onto the road, he held his horse back, undecided whether to ride on it or cross it and ride uphill across the black field. It was safer to drive along the road brightened in the fog, because people could be seen more quickly. “Follow me,” he said, crossed the road and began to gallop up the mountain, to the place where the French picket had been standing since evening.","Rostov spurred his horse, called Sergeant Fedchenko and two more hussars, told them to follow him, and rode at a trot down the hill in the direction of the continuing cries. Rostov felt both frightened and elated to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance, where no one had been before him. Bagration shouted to him from above not to go beyond the brook, but Rostov pretended not to hear his words, and, without stopping, rode further and further on, constantly making mistakes, taking bushes for trees and hollows for people, and constantly explaining his mistakes to himself. Having trotted down the hill, he no longer saw either our own or the enemy's fires, but he heard the cries of the French more loudly and clearly. In the bottom he saw before him something like a stream, but when he reached it, he recognized it as a trodden road. Coming out onto the road, he reined in his horse, undecided whether to follow it or to cross and ride over the black field up the hillside. To ride along the road, which stood out lighter in the mist, was less dangerous, because he could see people better. “Follow me!” he said, crossed the road, and began to gallop up the hill to the place where French pickets had been posted in the evening.","Rostov spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fedchenko and two other hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction from which the shouting came.

Bagration called to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream, but Rostov pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies for men, and continually discovering his mistakes. Descending the hill at a trot he no longer saw either our own or the enemy’s fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudly and distinctly. In the valley he saw before him something like a river, but when he reached it he found it was a road. Having come out onto the road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black field up the hill-side.

"Анатоль сидел, сняв камзол и подпершись руками в бока, перед столом, на угол которого он, улыбаясь, пристально и рассеянно устремил свои прекрасные большие глаза. На всю жизнь свою он смотрел как на непрерывное увеселение, которое кто-то такой почему-то обязался устроить для него. Так же и теперь он смотрел на свою поездку к злому старику и к богатой уродливой наследнице. Всё это могло выйти, по его предположению, очень хорошо и забавно.

It never interferes, thought Anatole.","Anatole, having taken off his tunic, sat with arms akimbo before a table, at a corner of which, smiling, he directed fixedly and distractedly his beautiful big eyes.

Now, too, he looked in this way upon his journey to the wicked old man and the rich, ugly heiress. All this, as he supposed, might turn out very nice and amusing. “And why shouldn't I marry her, if she's very rich? That never hurts,” thought Anatole.","Anatole having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his large and handsome eyes.

"Князь Андрей с презрением смотрел на эти бесконечные, мешавшиеся команды, повозки, парки, артиллерию и опять повозки, повозки и повозки всех возможных видов, обгонявшие одна другую и в три, в четыре ряда запружавшие грязную дорогу. Со всех сторон, назади и впереди, покуда хватал слух, слышались звуки колес, громыхание кузовов, телег и лафетов, лошадиный топот, удары кнутом, крики понуканий, ругательства солдат, денщиков и офицеров. По краям дороги видны были беспрестанно то павшие ободранные и неободранные лошади, то сломанные повозки, у которых, дожидаясь чего-то, сидели одинокие солдаты, то отделившиеся от команд солдаты, которые толпами направлялись в соседние деревни или тащили из деревень кур, баранов, сено или мешки, чем-то наполненные.","Prince Andrei looked with disdain at these endless, interfering teams, wagons, parks, artillery, and again wagons, wagons and wagons of all possible types, overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road in three, four rows. From all sides, behind and in front, as long as hearing was enough, the sounds of wheels, the rumble of bodies, carts and gun carriages, the clatter of horses, blows with a whip, shouts of prodding, curses of soldiers, batmen and officers were heard. Along the edges of the road, one could see incessantly fallen horses, skinned and not skinned, then broken carts, in which, waiting for something, lone soldiers were sitting, then soldiers separated from the teams, who were heading in crowds to neighboring villages or dragging chickens, rams, hay from the villages or bags filled with something.","Prince Andrei looked with scorn at these countless mixed-up detachments, wagons, caissons, artillery, and again wagons, wagons of all possible sorts, trying to get ahead of each other and choking the muddy road three or four abreast.

On the roadsides one constantly saw now dead horses, skinned or unskinned, now broken-down wagons, near which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something, now soldiers who separated from their detachments and went in groups to the neighboring villages or came from the villages dragging chickens, sheep, hay, or sacks filled with something.","He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments, carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage-wagons and vehicles of all kinds, overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and sometimes four abreast.

All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some flayed, some not, and broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something, and again soldiers straggling from their companies, crowds of whom set off to the neighbouring villages, or returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks."
"Князь Василий нахмурился, сморщил рот на сторону, щеки его запрыгали с свойственным ему неприятным, грубым выражением; он, встряхнувшись, встал, закинул назад голову и решительными шагами, мимо дам, прошел в маленькую гостиную.

"Насилу, с помощью пехоты, вывезли орудия в гору, и достигши деревни Гунтерсдорф, остановились.

"— Нет, послушайте, — сказал Пьер, успокоиваясь. — Вы удивительный человек. То, что вы сейчас сказали, очень хорошо, очень хорошо. Разумеется, вы меня не знаете. Мы так давно не видались…детьми еще… Вы можете предполагать во мне… Я вас понимаю, очень понимаю. Я бы этого не сделал, у меня недостало бы духу, но это прекрасно.

Со всex сторон слышны были новые и новые рассказы об отдельных примерах мужества, оказанных нашими солдатами и офицерами при Аустерлице. Тот спас знамя, тот убил 5-ть французов, тот один заряжал 5-ть пушек. Говорили и про Берга, кто его не знал, что он, раненый в правую руку, взял шпагу в левую и пошел вперед.

"Огромный кабинет был наполнен вещами, очевидно, беспрестанно-употребляемыми.

Сделав несколько кругов, он снял ногу с педали станка, обтер стамеску, кинул ее в кожаный карман, приделанный к станку, и, подойдя к столу, подозвал дочь. Он никогда не благословлял своих детей и только, подставив ей щетинистую, еще небритую нынче щеку, сказал, строго и вместе с тем внимательно-нежно оглядев ее:","The huge office was filled with things, obviously, incessantly used.

Having made several circles, he took his foot off the pedal of the machine, wiped the chisel, threw it into a leather pocket attached to the machine, and, going up to the table, called his daughter.

"Офицеры встали и окружили казаков и пленного француза. Французский драгун был молодой малый, альзасец, говоривший по-французски с немецким акцентом. Он задыхался от волнения, лицо его было красно, и, услыхав французский язык, он быстро заговорил с офицерами, обращаясь то к тому, то к другому. Он говорил, что его бы не взяли; что он не виноват в том, что его взяли, а виноват le caporal, который послал его захватить попоны, что он ему говорил, что уже русские там. И ко всякому слову он прибавлял: mais qu'on ne fasse pas de mal a mon petit cheval [Но не обижайте мою лошадку, ] и ласкал свою лошадь. Видно было, что он не понимал хорошенько, где он находится. Он то извинялся, что его взяли, то, предполагая перед собою свое начальство, выказывал свою солдатскую исправность и заботливость о службе. Он донес с собой в наш арьергард во всей свежести атмосферу французского войска, которое так чуждо было для нас.","The officers stood up and surrounded the Cossacks and the captured Frenchman.

He said they wouldn't take him; that it was not his fault that they took him, but le caporal, who sent him to seize blankets, that he told him that the Russians were already there. And to every word he added: mais qu'on ne fasse pas de mal a mon petit cheval [But don't hurt my horse,] and caressed his horse. It was evident that he did not understand well where he was. He either apologized for being taken, or, assuming his superiors in front of him, showed his soldierly serviceability and concern for the service.

"Когда прошли те двадцать минут, которые нужны были для срока вставанья старого князя, Тихон пришел звать молодого князя к отцу.

"Ночь была темная, звездная; дорога чернелась между белевшим снегом, выпавшим накануне, в день сражения. То перебирая впечатления прошедшего сражения, то радостно воображая впечатление, которое он произведет известием о победе, вспоминая проводы главнокомандующего и товарищей, князь Андрей скакал в почтовой бричке, испытывая чувство человека, долго ждавшего и, наконец, достигшего начала желаемого счастия.

"Пройдя с голодными, разутыми солдатами, без дороги, по горам, в бурную ночь сорок пять верст, растеряв третью часть отсталыми, Багратион вышел в Голлабрун на венско-цнаймскую дорогу несколькими часами прежде французов, подходивших к Голлабруну из Вены. Кутузову надо было итти еще целые сутки с своими обозами, чтобы достигнуть Цнайма, и потому, чтобы спасти армию, Багратион должен был с четырьмя тысячами голодных, измученных солдат удерживать в продолжение суток всю неприятельскую армию, встретившуюся с ним в Голлабруне, что было, очевидно, невозможно. Но странная судьба сделала невозможное возможным. Успех того обмана, который без боя отдал венский мост в руки французов, побудил Мюрата пытаться обмануть так же и Кутузова. Мюрат, встретив слабый отряд Багратиона на цнаймской дороге, подумал, что это была вся армия Кутузова. Чтобы несомненно раздавить эту армию, он поджидал отставшие по дороге из Вены войска и с этою целью предложил перемирие на три дня, с условием, чтобы те и другие войска не изменяли своих положений и не трогались с места. Мюрат уверял, что уже идут переговоры о мире и что потому, избегая бесполезного пролития крови, он предлагает перемирие. Австрийский генерал граф Ностиц, стоявший на аванпостах, поверил словам парламентера Мюрата и отступил, открыв отряд Багратиона. Другой парламентер поехал в русскую цепь объявить то же известие о мирных переговорах и предложить перемирие русским войскам на три дня. Багратион отвечал, что он не может принимать или не принимать перемирия, и с донесением о сделанном ему предложении послал к Кутузову своего адъютанта.","Having passed with hungry, barefoot soldiers, without a road, through the mountains, on a stormy night forty-five miles, losing a third of the backward, Bagration went to Gollabrun on the Vienna-Znaim road a few hours before the French approached Gollabrun from Vienna. Kutuzov had to go for another whole day with his carts in order to reach Znaim, and therefore, in order to save the army, Bagration, with four thousand hungry, exhausted soldiers, had to hold the entire enemy army that met him in Gollabrun for a day, which was obviously , impossible. But a strange fate made the impossible possible. The success of that deception, which without a fight gave the Vienna bridge into the hands of the French, prompted Murat to try to deceive Kutuzov in the same way. Murat, having met the weak detachment of Bagration on the Tsnaim road, thought that it was the whole army of Kutuzov. In order to undoubtedly crush this army, he waited for the troops that had lagged behind on the road from Vienna and for this purpose proposed a truce for three days, on condition that both troops did not change their positions and did not move. Murat assured that peace negotiations were already underway and that therefore, avoiding the useless shedding of blood, he proposed a truce. The Austrian general Count Nostitz, who was standing at the outposts, believed the words of Murat's truce and retreated, opening Bagration's detachment. Another truce went to the Russian chain to announce the same news of peace negotiations and offer a truce to the Russian troops for three days. Bagration replied that he could not accept or not accept a truce, and with a report on the proposal made to him, he sent his adjutant to Kutuzov.","Having gone thirty miles across the hills with hungry, ill-shod soldiers, with no road, on a stormy night, losing a third of his men as stragglers, Bagration came out in Hollabrunn, on the Vienna-Znaim road, several hours ahead of the French, who were approaching Hollabrunn from Vienna. Kutuzov still needed to go a whole twenty-four hours with his baggage train to reach Znaim, and therefore, to save the army, Bagration, with four thousand hungry. exhausted soldiers, had to hold off for twenty-four hours the entire enemy army coming to meet him at Hollabrunn, which was obviously impossible. But a freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trick which gave the Vienna bridge into the hands of the French without a fight prompted Murat to try to trick Kutuzov in the same way. Murat, meeting Bagration's weak detachment on the Znaim road, thought it was the whole of Kutuzov's army. In order to crush this army indubitably, he awaited the troops that lagged behind on the road from Vienna, and with that aim suggested a three-day truce, on condition that neither army change its position or stir from its place. Murat assured them that peace negotiations were already under way and that therefore, to avoid useless bloodshed, he was suggesting a truce. The Austrian general, Count Nostitz, who occupied the advance posts, believed the words of Murat's envoy and fell back, exposing Bagration's detachment. Another envoy rode to the Russian line to announce the same news of peace negotiations and offer the Russian army a three-day truce. Bagration replied that he could neither accept nor reject a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutuzov with a report of the offer made to him.","Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way, Bagration came out on the Vienna– Znaim road at Hollabrünn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrünn from Vienna. Kutuzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagration with his four thousand hungry exhausted men, would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at Hollabrünn, which was clearly impossible. But a freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trick that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without a fight, led Murat to try to deceive Kutuzov in a similar way. Meeting Bagration’s weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be Kutuzov’s whole army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna, and with this object offered a three days’ truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving. Murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed Murat’s emissary and retired, leaving Bagration’s division exposed. Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days’ truce. Bagration replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce, and sent his adjutant to Kutuzov to report the offer he had received."

"Старик Болконский всегда был невысокого мнения о характере князя Василья, и тем более в последнее время, когда князь Василий в новые царствования при Павле и Александре далеко пошел в чинах и почестях. Теперь же, по намекам письма и маленькой княгини, он понял, в чем дело, и невысокое мнение о князе Василье перешло в душе князя Николая Андреича в чувство недоброжелательного презрения. Он постоянно фыркал, говоря про него. В тот день, как приехать князю Василью, князь Николай Андреич был особенно недоволен и не в духе. Оттого ли он был не в духе, что приезжал князь Василий, или оттого он был особенно недоволен приездом князя Василья, что был не в духе; но он был не в духе, и Тихон еще утром отсоветывал архитектору входить с докладом к князю.","The old man Bolkonsky always had a low opinion of the character of Prince Vasily, and even more so recently, when Prince Vasily, in the new reigns under Paul and Alexander, went far in ranks and honors. Now, from the hints of the letter and the little princess, he understood what was the matter, and the low opinion of Prince Vasily turned in the soul of Prince Nikolai Andreevich into a feeling of unfriendly contempt. He constantly snorted, talking about him. On the day Prince Vasily arrived, Prince Nikolai Andreevich was especially dissatisfied and out of sorts. Was it because he was out of sorts that Prince Vasily was coming, or because he was especially dissatisfied with the arrival of Prince Vasily, because he was out of sorts; but he was not in a good mood, and even in the morning Tikhon advised the architect not to come in with a report to the prince.","Old Bolkonsky had always had a rather low opinion of Prince Vassily's character, and the more so in recent times, when Prince Vassily, under the new reigns of Paul and Alexander, had gone far in rank and honors.

He snorted whenever he mentioned him. On the day of Prince Vasili’s arrival Prince Bolkonsky was particularly discontented and out of temper. Whether he was in a bad temper because Prince Vasili was coming, or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at Prince Vasili’s visit, he was in a bad temper, and in the morning Tikhon had already advised the architect not to go to the prince with his report."

На другой день приехал князь Василий и поместился в доме графа. Он призвал к себе Пьера и сказал ему:,"The next day, Prince Vasily arrived and settled in the count's house.

"На одном конце стола во главе сидела графиня. Справа Марья Дмитриевна, слева Анна Михайловна и другие гостьи. На другом конце сидел граф, слева гусарский полковник, справа Шиншин и другие гости мужского пола. С одной стороны длинного стола молодежь постарше: Вера рядом с Бергом, Пьер рядом с Борисом; с другой стороны — дети, гувернеры и гувернантки. Граф из-за хрусталя, бутылок и ваз с фруктами поглядывал на жену и ее высокий чепец с голубыми лентами и усердно подливал вина своим соседям, не забывая и себя. Графиня так же, из-за ананасов, не забывая обязанности хозяйки, кидала значительные взгляды на мужа, которого лысина и лицо, казалось ей, своею краснотой резче отличались от седых волос. На дамском конце шло равномерное лепетанье; на мужском всё громче и громче слышались голоса, особенно гусарского полковника, который так много ел и пил, всё более и более краснея, что граф уже ставил его в пример другим гостям. Берг с нежной улыбкой говорил с Верой о том, что любовь есть чувство не земное, а небесное. Борис называл новому своему приятелю Пьеру бывших за столом гостей и переглядывался с Наташей, сидевшей против него. Пьер мало говорил, оглядывал новые лица и много ел. Начиная от двух супов, из которых он выбрал a la tortue, [черепаховый, ] и кулебяки и до рябчиков он не пропускал ни одного блюда и ни одного вина, которое дворецкий в завернутой салфеткою бутылке таинственно высовывал из-за плеча соседа, приговаривая или «дрей-мадера», или «венгерское», или «рейнвейн». Он подставлял первую попавшуюся из четырех хрустальных, с вензелем графа, рюмок, стоявших перед каждым прибором, и пил с удовольствием, всё с более и более приятным видом поглядывая на гостей. Наташа, сидевшая против него, глядела на Бориса, как глядят девочки тринадцати лет на мальчика, с которым они в первый раз только что поцеловались и в которого они влюблены. Этот самый взгляд ее иногда обращался на Пьера, и ему под взглядом этой смешной, оживленной девочки хотелось смеяться самому, не зная чему.","At one end of the table, the countess sat at the head. On the right is Marya Dmitrievna, on the left is Anna Mikhailovna and other guests. At the other end sat a count, on the left a hussar colonel, on the right Shinshin and other male guests. On one side of the long table, older youth: Vera next to Berg, Pierre next to Boris; on the other hand, children, tutors and governesses. The count from behind the crystal, bottles and vases of fruit looked at his wife and her high cap with blue ribbons and diligently poured wine to his neighbors, not forgetting himself. The Countess, too, from behind the pineapples, not forgetting her duties as a hostess, threw significant glances at her husband, whose bald head and face, it seemed to her, were sharply distinguished by their redness from gray hair. There was a regular babble at the ladies' end; voices were heard louder and louder on the male, especially the hussar colonel, who ate and drank so much, blushing more and more that the count already set him as an example to other guests. Berg, with a gentle smile, spoke to Vera about the fact that love is not an earthly, but a heavenly feeling. Boris called his new friend Pierre the guests who were at the table and exchanged glances with Natasha, who was sitting opposite him. Pierre spoke little, looked at new faces and ate a lot. Starting from two soups, from which he chose a la tortue, [turtle,] and kulebyaki, and up to grouse, he did not miss a single dish and not a single wine, which the butler in a bottle wrapped in a napkin mysteriously stuck out from behind his neighbor’s shoulder, saying or “ drey-madera”, or “hungarian”, or “rhine wine”. He substituted the first of the four crystal glasses with the count's monogram, which stood in front of each device, and drank with pleasure, looking more and more pleasantly at the guests. Natasha, who was sitting opposite him, looked at Boris, as girls of thirteen look at the boy with whom they had just kissed for the first time and with whom they are in love. This same look of hers sometimes turned to Pierre, and under the look of this funny, lively girl he wanted to laugh himself, not knowing why.","At the head of the table on one end sat the countess. To her right Marya Dmitrievna, to her left Anna Mikhailovna and the other ladies. At the other end sat the count, to his left the hussar colonel, to his right Shinshin and the other male guests. One side of the long table was occupied by the older young people: Vera sat next to Berg, Pierre next to Boris; on the other side were the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind the crystal, the bottles, and the bowls of fruit, the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with blue ribbons, and diligently poured wine for his neighbors, not forgetting himself. The countess, too, from behind the pineapples, never forgetting her duties as hostess, cast meaningful glances at her husband, the redness of whose face and bald head, it seemed to her, contrasted sharply with his gray hair. At the ladies' end a steady chatter went on; at the men's, louder and louder voices could be heard, especially that of the hussar colonel, who ate and drank so much, growing redder and redder, that the count now set him as an example to the other guests. Berg was saying to Vera, with a tender smile, that love was a heavenly, not an earthly, feeling. Boris was naming the guests at the table for his new friend Pierre, while exchanging glances with Natasha, who was sitting across from him. Pierre spoke little, looked at the new faces, and ate a lot. Starting with the two soups, of which he chose à la tortue,[112] and the savory pie, and right up to the hazel grouse, he did not skip a single dish or a single wine, which the butler mysteriously displayed for him behind his neighbor's shoulder, the bottle wrapped in a napkin, murmuring: “dry Madeira,” or “Hungarian,” or “Rhine wine.” Of the four crystal glasses with the count's monogram that stood before each place, he would hold out the first he happened upon and drank with enjoyment, glancing around at the guests with a more and more pleasant air. Natasha, who was sitting across from him, gazed at Boris as a thirteen-year-old girl gazes at a boy she has just kissed for the first time and is in love with. She occasionally turned this same gaze to Pierre, and, under the gaze of this funny, lively girl, he wanted to laugh himself, without knowing why.","At one end of the table sat the countess with Marya Dmitrievna on her right and Anna Mikhailovna on her left, the other lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshin and the other male visitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the grown-up young people: Vera beside Berg, and Pierre beside Boris; and on the other side the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind the crystal decanters and fruit-dishes the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbours’ glasses, not neglecting his own. The countess in turn, without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his grey hair. At the ladies’ end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the men’s end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the colonel of hussars, who growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg with tender smiles was saying to Vera that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling. Boris was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with Natasha, who was sitting opposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a great deal. Of the two soups he chose à la tortue1 with savoury patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines. These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward wrapped in a napkin from behind the next man’s shoulders and whispered: ‘Dry Madeira’ … ‘Hungarian’ … or ‘Rhine-wine’ as the case might be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count’s monogram that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other guests. Natasha, who sat opposite, was looking at Boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny lively little girl’s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why."

"Объехав всю линию войск от правого до левого фланга, князь Андрей поднялся на ту батарею, с которой, по словам штаб-офицера, всё поле было видно. Здесь он слез с лошади и остановился у крайнего из четырех снятых с передков орудий. Впереди орудий ходил часовой-артиллерист, вытянувшийся было перед офицером, но по сделанному ему знаку возобновивший свое равномерное, скучливое хождение.

In front of the cannon paced an artillery sentry, who snapped to attention before the officer, but at a sign from him renewed his measured, tedious pacing. Behind the cannon stood their limbers, further behind a hitching rail and the campfires of the artillerists. To the left, not far from the last cannon, there was a newly plaited lean-to from which came the animated voices of the officers, Indeed, from the battery a view opened out of almost the entire disposition of the Russian troops and the greater part of the enemy's.","HAVING ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince Andrei made his way up to the battery from which the staff-officer had told him the whole field could be seen.

"Она обращалась к нему всегда с радостной, доверчивой, к нему одному относившейся улыбкой, в которой было что-то значительней того, что было в общей улыбке, украшавшей всегда ее лицо. Пьер знал, что все ждут только того, чтобы он, наконец, сказал одно слово, переступил через известную черту, и он знал, что он рано или поздно переступит через нее; но какой-то непонятный ужас охватывал его при одной мысли об этом страшном шаге.

"В Лысых Горах, имении князя Николая Андреевича Болконского, ожидали с каждым днем приезда молодого князя Андрея с княгиней; но ожидание не нарушало стройного порядка, по которому шла жизнь в доме старого князя. Генерал-аншеф князь Николай Андреевич, по прозванию в обществе le roi de Prusse, [король прусский, ] с того времени, как при Павле был сослан в деревню, жил безвыездно в своих Лысых Горах с дочерью, княжною Марьей, и при ней компаньонкой, m-lle Bourienne. [мадмуазель Бурьен. ] И в новое царствование, хотя ему и был разрешен въезд в столицы, он также продолжал безвыездно жить в деревне, говоря, что ежели кому его нужно, то тот и от Москвы полтораста верст доедет до Лысых Гор, а что ему никого и ничего не нужно. Он говорил, что есть только два источника людских пороков: праздность и суеверие, и что есть только две добродетели: деятельность и ум. Он сам занимался воспитанием своей дочери и, чтобы развивать в ней обе главные добродетели, до двадцати лет давал ей уроки алгебры и геометрии и распределял всю ее жизнь в беспрерывных занятиях. Сам он постоянно был занят то писанием своих мемуаров, то выкладками из высшей математики, то точением табакерок на станке, то работой в саду и наблюдением над постройками, которые не прекращались в его имении. Так как главное условие для деятельности есть порядок, то и порядок в его образе жизни был доведен до последней степени точности. Его выходы к столу совершались при одних и тех же неизменных условиях, и не только в один и тот же час, но и минуту. С людьми, окружавшими его, от дочери до слуг, князь был резок и неизменно-требователен, и потому, не быв жестоким, он возбуждал к себе страх и почтительность, каких не легко мог бы добиться самый жестокий человек. Несмотря на то, что он был в отставке и не имел теперь никакого значения в государственных делах, каждый начальник той губернии, где было имение князя, считал своим долгом являться к нему и точно так же, как архитектор, садовник или княжна Марья, дожидался назначенного часа выхода князя в высокой официантской. И каждый в этой официантской испытывал то же чувство почтительности и даже страха, в то время как отворялась громадно-высокая дверь кабинета и показывалась в напудренном парике невысокая фигурка старика, с маленькими сухими ручками и серыми висячими бровями, иногда, как он насупливался, застилавшими блеск умных и точно молодых блестящих глаз.","In Bald Mountains, the estate of Prince Nikolai Andreevich Bolkonsky, every day they expected the arrival of young Prince Andrei with the princess; but the expectation did not disturb the orderly order in which life went on in the old prince's house. General-anshef Prince Nikolai Andreevich, nicknamed in society le roi de Prusse, [King of Prussia,] since the time when Paul was exiled to the village, he lived without a break in his Bald Mountains with his daughter, Princess Marya, and with her companion, m lle Bourienne. [Mademoiselle Bourienne. ] And in the new reign, although he was allowed to enter the capitals, he also continued to live without a break in the countryside, saying that if anyone needs him, then he will reach a hundred and fifty miles from Moscow to the Bald Mountains, and that he has no one and nothing need to. He said that there are only two sources of human vices: idleness and superstition, and that there are only two virtues: activity and intelligence. He himself was engaged in the education of his daughter and, in order to develop in her both main virtues, until the age of twenty he gave her lessons in algebra and geometry and distributed her whole life in uninterrupted studies. He himself was constantly busy either writing his memoirs, or calculations from higher mathematics, or turning snuff boxes on a machine tool, or working in the garden and observing the buildings that did not stop on his estate. Since the main condition for activity is order, order in his way of life was brought to the highest degree of accuracy. His exits to the table were made under the same constant conditions, and not only at the same hour, but also at the minute. With the people around him, from his daughter to his servants, the prince was harsh and invariably demanding, and therefore, without being cruel, he aroused fear and respect for himself, which the most cruel person could not easily achieve. Despite the fact that he was retired and now had no importance in state affairs, each head of the province where the prince's estate was, considered it his duty to appear to him and, just like an architect, gardener or Princess Mary, waited for the appointed hours of the prince's exit in the high waiter's room. And everyone in this waiter's room experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear, while the enormously high door of the office opened and a short figure of an old man appeared in a powdered wig, with small dry hands and gray hanging eyebrows, sometimes, as he frowned, obscured the shine intelligent and precisely young shining eyes.","At Bald Hills, the estate of Prince Nikolai Andreevich Bolkonsky, the arrival of the young Prince Andrei and the princess was expected any day; but that expectation did not disrupt the harmonious order in which life went on in the old prince's house. General in Chief Prince Nikolai Andreevich, known in society as le roi de Prusse,[147] had been banished to his country estate under Paul, and had lived uninterruptedly at Bald Hills ever since, with his daughter, Princess Marya, and her companion, Mlle Bourienne. And under the new reign, though he was permitted entry to the capitals,[42] he went on living uninterruptedly in the country, saying that anyone who needed him could travel the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, but that he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to say that there were only two sources of human vice: idleness and superstition; and that there were only two virtues: activity and intelligence. He occupied himself personally with his daughter's upbringing, and to develop the two chief virtues in her, gave her lessons in algebra and geometry and portioned out her whole life among constant studies. He himself was constantly occupied, now with writing his memoirs, now with higher mathematical calculations, now with turning snuff boxes on a lathe, now with working in the garden and supervising the construction work that never ceased on his estate. As the main condition for activity was order, so the order in his way of life was brought to the utmost degree of precision. His coming to the table was performed under the same invariable conditions, and not only at the same hour, but at the same minute. With the people around him, from his daughter to the servants, the prince was brusque and invariably demanding, and thus, without being cruel, inspired a fear and respect for himself such as the cruelest of men would not find it easy to obtain. Though he was retired and now had no importance in state affairs, every governor of the province in which the prince's estate lay considered it his duty to call on him and, like the architect, the gardener, or Princess Marya, to wait at the appointed hour for the prince to come out to the high-ceilinged waiting room. And each person in the waiting room experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear at the moment when the immensely high door to the study opened and revealed the small figure of the old man, in a powdered wig, with small dry hands and gray beetling brows, which sometimes, when he frowned, hid the brightness of his intelligent and youthfully bright eyes.","AT Bald Hills, Prince Nikolai Andreevich Bolkonsky’s estate, the arrival of young Prince Andrei and his wife was daily expected, but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince’s household. General-in-Chief* Prince Nikolai Andreevich (nicknamed in society le roi de Prusse,* ever since the Emperor Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter, Princess Marya, and her companion Mademoiselle Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals he still continued to live in the country, remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to say that there are only two sources of human vice—idleness and superstition, and only two virtues—activity and intelligence. He himself undertook his daughter’s education, and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving problems in higher mathematics, turning snuff-boxes on a lathe, working in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on at his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity, regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same conditions, and not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With those about him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hard-hearted men would have aroused. Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high official appointed to the province in which the prince’s estate lay considered it his duty to visit him, and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Marya did, till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy grey eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd, youthfully glittering eyes."

He almost dragged him to the window. - This is Denisov's money, you took it ... - he whispered in his ear.","“Come here,” said Rostov, seizing Telyanin by the arm.

Voilà comment tout cela finira. ’3 And he released Bolkonsky’s arm to indicate that he had now quite finished."
"— On dit que vous embellissez votre maison de Petersbourg. [Говорят, вы отделываете свой петербургский дом. ]",— On dit que vous embellissez votre maison de Petersbourg. [They say you are finishing your St. Petersburg house. ],“On dit que vous embellisez votre maison de Pétersbourg.”[232],"A little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna Pavlovna said to him: ‘On dit que vous embellissez votre maison de Pétersbourg?’2 This was true."
"Дежурный флигель-адъютант, встретивший князя Андрея, попросил его подождать и пошел к военному министру. Через пять минут флигель-адъютант вернулся и, особенно учтиво наклонясь и пропуская князя Андрея вперед себя, провел его через коридор в кабинет, где занимался военный министр. Флигель-адъютант своею изысканною учтивостью, казалось, хотел оградить себя от попыток фамильярности русского адъютанта. Радостное чувство князя Андрея значительно ослабело, когда он подходил к двери кабинета военного министра. Он почувствовал себя оскорбленным, и чувство оскорбления перешло в то же мгновенье незаметно для него самого в чувство презрения, ни на чем не основанного. Находчивый же ум в то же мгновение подсказал ему ту точку зрения, с которой он имел право презирать и адъютанта и военного министра. «Им, должно быть, очень легко покажется одерживать победы, не нюхая пороха!» подумал он. Глаза его презрительно прищурились; он особенно-медленно вошел в кабинет военного министра. Чувство это еще более усилилось, когда он увидал военного министра, сидевшего над большим столом и первые две минуты не обращавшего внимания на вошедшего. Военный министр опустил свою лысую, с седыми висками, голову между двух восковых свечей и читал, отмечая карандашом, бумаги. Он дочитывал, не поднимая головы, в то время как отворилась дверь и послышались шаги.","The adjutant on duty, who met Prince Andrei, asked him to wait and went to the Minister of War. Five minutes later, the aide-de-camp returned and, leaning especially politely and letting Prince Andrei go ahead of him, led him through the corridor to the office where the minister of war was studying. The aide-de-camp wing, by his refined courtesy, seemed to want to protect himself from the Russian adjutant's attempts at familiarity. The joyful feeling of Prince Andrei weakened significantly when he approached the door of the office of the Minister of War. He felt insulted, and the feeling of insult passed at the same instant, imperceptibly for him, into a feeling of contempt based on nothing. A resourceful mind at the same instant suggested to him the point of view from which he had the right to despise both the adjutant and the minister of war. “It must be very easy for them to win victories without smelling gunpowder!” he thought. His eyes narrowed contemptuously; he entered the office of the minister of war with particular slowness. This feeling was even more intensified when he saw the Minister of War sitting over a large table and for the first two minutes paying no attention to the newcomer. The Minister of War lowered his bald head with gray temples between two wax candles and read, marking the papers with a pencil. He finished reading without raising his head as the door opened and footsteps were heard.","The imperial adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrei, asked him to wait and went to the minister of war. Five minutes later the imperial adjutant returned and, inclining with particular courtesy and letting Prince Andrei go ahead of him, led him down the corridor to the office where the minister of war worked. The imperial adjutant seemed to want to protect himself from any attempts at familiarity from the Russian adjutant. Prince Andrei's joyful feeling weakened significantly as he approached the doors of the minister of war's office. He felt offended, and the feeling of offense turned that same instant, without his noticing it, into a feeling of totally groundless scorn. His resourceful mind suggested to him that same instant the point of view from which he had the right to scorn both the adjutant and the minister of war. “To him it must seem very easy to win a victory, having never had a whiff of powder!” he thought. His eyes narrowed scornfully; he entered the minister of war's office especially slowly. This feeling increased still more when he saw the minister of war sitting at the big desk and for the first two minutes paying no attention to the one who had entered. The minister of war had lowered his bald head with gray temples between two wax candles and was reading some papers, making notes with a pencil. He went on reading to the end, without raising his head, when the door opened and footsteps were heard.","The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrei, asked him to wait, and went in to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrei before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work. The adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger. Prince Andrei’s joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he approached the door of the minister’s room. He felt offended, and without his noticing it the feeling of offence immediately turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister. ‘Away from the smell of powder, they probably think it easy to win victories!’ he thought. His eyes narrowed disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with peculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each side of the minister’s bent bald head with its grey temples. He went on reading to the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps."

"Князь Андрей уезжал на другой день вечером. Старый князь, не отступая от своего порядка, после обеда ушел к себе. Маленькая княгиня была у золовки. Князь Андрей, одевшись в дорожный сюртук без эполет, в отведенных ему покоях укладывался с своим камердинером. Сам осмотрев коляску и укладку чемоданов, он велел закладывать. В комнате оставались только те вещи, которые князь Андрей всегда брал с собой: шкатулка, большой серебряный погребец, два турецких пистолета и шашка, подарок отца, привезенный из-под Очакова. Все эти дорожные принадлежности были в большом порядке у князя Андрея: всё было ново, чисто, в суконных чехлах, старательно завязано тесемочками.","Prince Andrei left the next day in the evening.

Having inspected the carriage and the packing of the suitcases himself, he ordered to lay it down.

"В назначенный час, напудренный и выбритый, князь вышел в столовую, где ожидала его невестка, княжна Марья, m-lle Бурьен и архитектор князя, по странной прихоти его допускаемый к столу, хотя по своему положению незначительный человек этот никак не мог рассчитывать на такую честь. Князь, твердо державшийся в жизни различия состояний и редко допускавший к столу даже важных губернских чиновников, вдруг на архитекторе Михайле Ивановиче, сморкавшемся в углу в клетчатый платок, доказывал, что все люди равны, и не раз внушал своей дочери, что Михайла Иванович ничем не хуже нас с тобой. За столом князь чаще всего обращался к бессловесному Михайле Ивановичу.","At the appointed hour, powdered and shaved, the prince went out into the dining room, where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, m-lle Bourienne, and the prince's architect, who, by his strange whim, were allowed to eat, were waiting for him, although this insignificant person by his position could not count on such honor. The prince, who firmly adhered to the difference in fortunes in life and rarely allowed even important provincial officials to the table, suddenly proved to the architect Mikhail Ivanovich, who was blowing his nose in a checkered handkerchief in a corner, that all people are equal, and more than once inspired his daughter that Mikhail Ivanovich did nothing worse than you and me. At the table, the prince most often turned to the dumb Mikhail Ivanovich.","At the appointed hour, powdered and clean-shaven, the prince came out to the dining room, where he was awaited by his daughter-in-law, Princess Marya, Mlle Bourienne, and the prince's architect, who by the prince's strange caprice was admitted to the table, though by his insignificant position the man could in no way count on such an honor. The prince, who in his life kept firmly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important provincial officials to the table, suddenly decided to demonstrate by means of the architect Mikhail Ivanovich, who used to blow his nose in the corner on a checkered handkerchief, that all men are equal, and more than once impressed it upon his daughter that Mikhail Ivanovich was no worse than you or I. At table the prince most often addressed himself to the wordless Mikhail Ivanovich.","AT the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the dining-room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Marya, and Mademoiselle Bourienne, were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by a strange caprice of his employer’s was admitted to table, though the position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that honour. The prince, who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Mikhail Ivanovich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Mikhail Ivanovich was ‘not a whit worse than you or I’. At dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn Mikhail Ivanovich more often than to anyone else."

"В столовой, громадно-высокой, как и все комнаты в доме, ожидали выхода князя домашние и официанты, стоявшие за каждым стулом; дворецкий, с салфеткой на руке, оглядывал сервировку, мигая лакеям и постоянно перебегая беспокойным взглядом от стенных часов к двери, из которой должен был появиться князь.

Prince Andrei looked at a huge, new to him, golden frame depicting the genealogical tree of the princes Bolkonsky, hanging opposite an equally huge frame with a badly made (apparently by the hand of a house painter) image of a sovereign prince in a crown, who was supposed to come from Rurik and be the ancestor of the Bolkonsky family.

"В деревне Гостиерадеке были хотя и спутанные, но в большем порядке русские войска, шедшие прочь с поля сражения. Сюда уже не доставали французские ядра, и звуки стрельбы казались далекими. Здесь все уже ясно видели и говорили, что сражение проиграно. К кому ни обращался Ростов, никто не мог сказать ему, ни где был государь, ни где был Кутузов. Одни говорили, что слух о ране государя справедлив, другие говорили, что нет, и объясняли этот ложный распространившийся слух тем, что, действительно, в карете государя проскакал назад с поля сражения бледный и испуганный обер-гофмаршал граф Толстой, выехавший с другими в свите императора на поле сражения. Один офицер сказал Ростову, что за деревней, налево, он видел кого-то из высшего начальства, и Ростов поехал туда, уже не надеясь найти кого-нибудь, но для того только, чтобы перед самим собою очистить свою совесть. Проехав версты три и миновав последние русские войска, около огорода, окопанного канавой, Ростов увидал двух стоявших против канавы всадников. Один, с белым султаном на шляпе, показался почему-то знакомым Ростову; другой, незнакомый всадник, на прекрасной рыжей лошади (лошадь эта показалась знакомою Ростову) подъехал к канаве, толкнул лошадь шпорами и, выпустив поводья, легко перепрыгнул через канаву огорода. Только земля осыпалась с насыпи от задних копыт лошади. Круто повернув лошадь, он опять назад перепрыгнул канаву и почтительно обратился к всаднику с белым султаном, очевидно, предлагая ему сделать то же. Всадник, которого фигура показалась знакома Ростову и почему-то невольно приковала к себе его внимание, сделал отрицательный жест головой и рукой, и по этому жесту Ростов мгновенно узнал своего оплакиваемого, обожаемого государя.","In the village of Gostieradeke there were, although confused, but in greater order, Russian troops marching away from the battlefield. French cannonballs were no longer reaching here, and the sounds of firing seemed far away. Here everyone already clearly saw and said that the battle was lost. To whom Rostov turned, no one could tell him where the sovereign was, or where Kutuzov was. Some said that the rumor about the wound of the sovereign was true, others said that it was not, and explained this false rumor that had spread by the fact that, indeed, in the sovereign’s carriage, the pale and frightened Chief Marshal Count Tolstoy galloped back from the battlefield, who left with others in retinue emperor on the battlefield. One officer told Rostov that behind the village, to the left, he saw someone from the higher authorities, and Rostov went there, no longer hoping to find anyone, but only to clear his conscience before himself. Having traveled about three versts and passed the last Russian troops, near a garden dug in by a ditch, Rostov saw two horsemen standing opposite the ditch. One, with a white sultan on his hat, seemed somehow familiar to Rostov; another, an unfamiliar rider, on a beautiful red horse (this horse seemed familiar to Rostov) rode up to the ditch, pushed the horse with his spurs and, releasing the reins, easily jumped over the ditch of the garden. Only the earth crumbled from the embankment from the hind hooves of the horse. Turning his horse sharply, he again jumped back over the ditch and respectfully addressed the rider with the white sultan, apparently suggesting that he do the same. The horseman, whose figure seemed familiar to Rostov and for some reason involuntarily attracted his attention, made a negative gesture with his head and hand, and by this gesture Rostov instantly recognized his mourned, adored sovereign.","In the village of Hostieradek, he found Russian troops, confused, but heading away from the battlefield in greater order.

Some said that the rumor of the sovereign's wound was correct, others said it was not and explained the spread of this false rumor by the fact that the grand marshal of the court, Count Tolstoy, who had ridden to the battlefield with others in the emperor's suite, had indeed galloped away from the battlefield, pale and frightened, in the sovereign's carriage. One officer told Rostov that he had seen someone from the high command to the left beyond the village, and Rostov went there, no longer hoping to find anyone, but only to keep his own conscience clear. Having ridden two miles and left behind the last of the Russian troops, Rostov saw two horsemen standing near a kitchen garden surrounded by a ditch. They were facing this ditch. One, with white plumes on his hat, seemed familiar to Rostov for some reason; the other, an unfamiliar horseman on a beautiful chestnut horse (the horse seemed familiar to Rostov), rode up to the ditch, spurred his horse and, releasing the reins, lightly jumped over the garden ditch.

Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was correct, others that it was not, and explained the false rumour that had spread by the fact that the Emperor’s carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal Count Tolstoy, who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the Emperor’s suite. One officer told Rostov that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village to the left, and in that direction Rostov rode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience.

"Вскоре после маленькой княгини вошел массивный, толстый молодой человек с стриженою головой, в очках, светлых панталонах по тогдашней моде, с высоким жабо и в коричневом фраке.

But, despite this inferior greeting, at the sight of Pierre entering, Anna Pavlovna displayed anxiety and fear, similar to that which is expressed at the sight of something too huge and unusual for the place.

"— Вы думаете?… — сказала Анна Павловна, чтобы сказать что-нибудь и вновь обратиться к своим занятиям хозяйки дома, но Пьер сделал обратную неучтивость. Прежде он, не дослушав слов собеседницы, ушел; теперь он остановил своим разговором собеседницу, которой нужно было от него уйти.

"«Главная новость, занимающая всю Москву, — смерть старого графа Безухого и его наследство. Представьте себе, три княжны получили какую-то малость, князь Василий ничего, а Пьер — наследник всего и, сверх того, признан законным сыном и потому графом Безухим и владельцем самого огромного состояния в России. Говорят, что князь Василий играл очень гадкую роль во всей этой истории, и что он уехал в Петербург очень сконфуженный. Признаюсь вам, я очень плохо понимаю все эти дела по духовным завещаниям; знаю только, что с тех пор как молодой человек, которого мы все знали под именем просто Пьера, сделался графом Безухим и владельцем одного из лучших состояний России, — я забавляюсь наблюдениями над переменой тона маменек, у которых есть дочери-невесты, и самих барышень в отношении к этому господину, который (в скобках будь сказано) всегда казался мне очень ничтожным. Так как уже два года все забавляются тем, чтобы приискивать мне женихов, которых я большею частью не знаю, то брачная хроника Москвы делает меня графинею Безуховой.

Это ни более ни менее как сын князя Василья, Анатоль, которого хотят пристроить, женив его на богатой и знатной девице, и на вас пал выбор родителей.

They say that Prince Vasily played a very nasty role in this whole story, and that he left for Petersburg very embarrassed. I confess to you that I understand very little all these matters of spiritual wills; I only know that since the young man, whom we all knew simply as Pierre, became Count Bezukhy and the owner of one of the best fortunes in Russia, I am amused by observations of the change in tone of mothers who have bride-daughters, and the young ladies themselves in relation to this gentleman, who (in parentheses, say) always seemed to me very insignificant. Since for two years now everyone has been amused by looking for suitors for me, whom I mostly do not know, the marriage chronicle of Moscow makes me Countess Bezukhova. But you understand that I do not want this at all. Speaking of marriages. Do you know that recently the universal aunt Anna Mikhailovna entrusted me, under the greatest secrecy, with the plan to arrange your marriage.

"На бугре у неприятеля показался дымок выстрела, и ядро, свистя, пролетело над головами гусарского эскадрона. Офицеры, стоявшие вместе, разъехались по местам. Гусары старательно стали выравнивать лошадей. В эскадроне всё замолкло. Все поглядывали вперед на неприятеля и на эскадронного командира, ожидая команды. Пролетело другое, третье ядро. Очевидно, что стреляли по гусарам; но ядро, равномерно-быстро свистя, пролетало над головами гусар и ударялось где-то сзади. Гусары не оглядывались, но при каждом звуке пролетающего ядра, будто по команде, весь эскадрон с своими однообразно-разнообразными лицами, сдерживая дыханье, пока летело ядро, приподнимался на стременах и снова опускался. Солдаты, не поворачивая головы, косились друг на друга, с любопытством высматривая впечатление товарища. На каждом лице, от Денисова до горниста, показалась около губ и подбородка одна общая черта борьбы, раздраженности и волнения. Вахмистр хмурился, оглядывая солдат, как будто угрожая наказанием. Юнкер Миронов нагибался при каждом пролете ядра. Ростов, стоя на левом фланге на своем тронутом ногами, но видном Грачике, имел счастливый вид ученика, вызванного перед большою публикой к экзамену, в котором он уверен, что отличится. Он ясно и светло оглядывался на всех, как бы прося обратить внимание на то, как он спокойно стоит под ядрами. Но и в его лице та же черта чего-то нового и строгого, против его воли, показывалась около рта.","Smoke from a shot appeared on a hillock near the enemy, and the ball, whistling, flew over the heads of the hussar squadron. The officers who had been standing together dispersed to their places. The hussars diligently began to straighten the horses. Everything in the squadron went silent. Everyone looked ahead at the enemy and at the squadron commander, waiting for the command. Another, third core flew by. It is obvious that they fired at the hussars; but the cannonball, whistling evenly and quickly, flew over the heads of the hussars and hit somewhere behind. The hussars did not look back, but at every sound of a flying cannonball, as if on command, the entire squadron, with its monotonous and varied faces, holding its breath while the cannonball was flying, rose in the stirrups and fell again. The soldiers, without turning their heads, squinted at each other, curiously looking for the impression of a comrade. On every face, from Denisov to the bugler, near the lips and chin, one common feature of struggle, irritation and excitement appeared. The sergeant-major frowned, looking at the soldiers, as if threatening punishment. Junker Mironov stooped down with each passage of the core. Rostov, standing on the left flank on his touched but visible Grachik, had the happy look of a student called before a large audience for an exam, in which he was sure that he would excel. He looked around clearly and brightly at everyone, as if asking them to pay attention to how he calmly stands under the cannonballs. But in his face, too, the same trait of something new and strict, against his will, showed near his mouth.","On a knoll occupied by the enemy, the smoke of a shot appeared, and a cannonball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The officers, who were standing together, rode to their posts. The hussars assiduously began lining up their horses. Everything became hushed in the squadron. Everyone kept looking ahead at the enemy and at the squadron commander, awaiting a command. Another cannonball flew over, then a third. Obviously, the shots were aimed at the hussars; but the cannonballs, with a rapid, steady whistling, kept flying over the hussars' heads and hitting somewhere behind them. The hussars did not look back, but with each sound of a flying cannonball, the whole squadron, as if on command, with all their similarly dissimilar faces, holding their breath while the cannonball flew over, rose in their stirrups, then lowered themselves again. Without turning their heads, the soldiers looked sideways at each other, curious to spy out a comrade's impressions. On each face, from Denisov's down to the bugler's, there appeared around the lips and chin one common trait of a struggle between irritation and excitement. The sergeant major frowned, looking the soldiers over as if threatening them with punishment. Junker Mironov ducked down each time a cannonball flew by. Rostov, standing on the left flank, on his slightly lame but imposing Little Rook, had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large public at an examination in which he is sure he will distinguish himself. He looked around at them all serenely and brightly, as if asking them to pay attention to how calmly he stood under fire. But on his face, too, that same trait of something new and stern appeared, against his will, around the mouth.","On the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon rose, and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The officers who had been standing together rode off to their places. The hussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the whole squadron. All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander, awaiting the word of command. A second and a third cannon-ball flew past. Evidently they were firing at the hussars, but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them. The hussars did not look round, but at the sound of each shot, as at the word of command, the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different, holding its breath while the ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and sank back again. The soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another, curious to see their comrades’ impression. Every face, from Denisov’s to that of the bugler, showed one common expression of conflict, irritation, and excitement, around chin and mouth. The quartermaster frowned, looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them. Cadet Mironov ducked every time a ball flew past. Rostov on the left flank, mounted on his Rook—a handsome horse despite its game leg—had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself. He was glancing at everyone with a clear bright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire. But despite himself, on his face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth."
"Лицо ее вдруг разгорелось, выражая отчаянную и веселую решимость. Она привстала, приглашая взглядом Пьера, сидевшего против нее, прислушаться, и обратилась к матери:","Her face suddenly flushed, expressing a desperate and cheerful determination. She half rose, inviting Pierre, who was sitting opposite her, to listen with a look, and turned to her mother:","Her face suddenly flushed, expressing a desperate and merry resolve. She stood up, her eyes inviting Pierre, who sat across from her, to listen, and addressed her mother.","Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what was coming, and turning to her mother:"

"Однако, как обыкновенно, в 9-м часу князь вышел гулять в своей бархатной шубке с собольим воротником и такой же шапке. Накануне выпал снег. Дорожка, по которой хаживал князь Николай Андреич к оранжерее, была расчищена, следы метлы виднелись на разметанном снегу, и лопата была воткнута в рыхлую насыпь снега, шедшую с обеих сторон дорожки. Князь прошел по оранжереям, по дворне и постройкам, нахмуренный и молчаливый.","However, as usual, at 9 o'clock the prince went out for a walk in his velvet coat with a sable collar and the same hat. It snowed the day before. The path along which Prince Nikolai Andreevich walked to the greenhouse had been cleared, broom marks could be seen in the swept snow, and the shovel had been stuck into the loose mound of snow that ran on both sides of the path. The prince walked through the greenhouses, through the household and buildings, frowning and silent.","However, as usual, after eight o'clock the prince went out for a walk in his velvet coat with the sable collar and matching hat.

"— Сегодня ночью, не позже, — сказал он тихо, с приличною улыбкой самодовольства в том, что ясно умеет понимать и выражать положение больного, и отошел.","“Tonight, not later,” he said quietly, with a decent smile of self-satisfaction in that he clearly knew how to understand and express the situation of the patient, and walked away.","“Tonight, no later,” he said softly, with a decent smile of self-satisfaction at being able to clearly understand and explain the patient's condition, and walked away.","‘Tonight, not later,’ said he in a low voice, and he moved away with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patient’s condition."
"— Как же вы найдете такое равновесие? — начал было Пьер; но в это время подошла Анна Павловна и, строго взглянув на Пьера, спросила итальянца о том, как он переносит здешний климат. Лицо итальянца вдруг изменилось и приняло оскорбительно притворно-сладкое выражение, которое, видимо, было привычно ему в разговоре с женщинами.","How do you find such a balance? Pierre began; but at that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and, looking sternly at Pierre, asked the Italian how he endured the local climate. The Italian's face suddenly changed and took on an offensively feigned sweet expression, which, apparently, was familiar to him in conversation with women.","“How are you going to find such balance?” Pierre began; but just then Anna Pavlovna came over and, with a stern glance at Pierre, asked the Italian how he was taking the local climate. The Italian's face suddenly changed and acquired an insultingly false sweetness of expression, which was probably habitual with him in conversations with women.","‘But how are you to get that balance?’ Pierre was beginning. At that moment Anna Pavlovna came up, and looking severely at Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood the Russian climate.

"Гости сидели за ужином. Княгиня Курагина, массивная, когда-то красивая, представительная женщина сидела на хозяйском месте. По обеим сторонам ее сидели почетнейшие гости — старый генерал, его жена, Анна Павловна Шерер; в конце стола сидели менее пожилые и почетные гости, и там же сидели домашние, Пьер и Элен, — рядом. Князь Василий не ужинал: он похаживал вокруг стола, в веселом расположении духа, подсаживаясь то к тому, то к другому из гостей. Каждому он говорил небрежное и приятное слово, исключая Пьера и Элен, которых присутствия он не замечал, казалось. Князь Василий оживлял всех. Ярко горели восковые свечи, блестели серебро и хрусталь посуды, наряды дам и золото и серебро эполет; вокруг стола сновали слуги в красных кафтанах; слышались звуки ножей, стаканов, тарелок и звуки оживленного говора нескольких разговоров вокруг этого стола. Слышно было, как старый камергер в одном конце уверял старушку-баронессу в своей пламенной любви к ней и ее смех; с другой — рассказ о неуспехе какой-то Марьи Викторовны. У середины стола князь Василий сосредоточил вокруг себя слушателей. Он рассказывал дамам, с шутливой улыбкой на губах, последнее — в среду — заседание государственного совета, на котором был получен и читался Сергеем Кузьмичем Вязмитиновым, новым петербургским военным генерал-губернатором, знаменитый тогда рескрипт государя Александра Павловича из армии, в котором государь, обращаясь к Сергею Кузьмичу, говорил, что со всех сторон получает он заявления о преданности народа, и что заявление Петербурга особенно приятно ему, что он гордится честью быть главою такой нации и постарается быть ее достойным. Рескрипт этот начинался словами: Сергей Кузьмич! Со всех сторон доходят до меня слухи и т. д.","The guests were at dinner. Princess Kuragina, a massive, once beautiful, imposing woman, was sitting in the master's seat. On both sides of it sat the most honored guests - the old general, his wife, Anna Pavlovna Sherer; at the end of the table sat the less elderly and honored guests, and there sat the family, Pierre and Helene, side by side. Prince Vasily did not have supper: he paced around the table, in a cheerful mood, sitting down now to one or another of the guests. To each he spoke a careless and pleasant word, with the exception of Pierre and Helen, whose presence he did not seem to notice. Prince Vasily revived everyone. Wax candles burned brightly, silver and crystal dishes shone, ladies' dresses and gold and silver epaulettes; servants in red caftans scurried around the table; there were the sounds of knives, glasses, plates, and the sounds of the lively conversation of several conversations around this table. At one end the old chamberlain could be heard assuring the old baroness of his fiery love for her and her laughter; on the other, a story about the failure of some Marya Viktorovna. At the middle of the table, Prince Vasily gathered listeners around him. He told the ladies, with a playful smile on his lips, the last - on Wednesday - meeting of the State Council, at which Sergey Kuzmich Vyazmitinov, the new St. to Sergei Kuzmich, he said that he received statements from all sides about the devotion of the people, and that the statement of St. Petersburg was especially pleasant to him, that he was proud of the honor of being the head of such a nation and would try to be worthy of it. This rescript began with the words: Sergey Kuzmich! Rumors reach me from all sides, etc.","The guests were sitting over supper. Princess Kuragin, a massive, once-beautiful, imposing woman, presided as mistress of the house. On either side of her sat the guests of honor—an old general, his wife, and Anna Pavlovna Scherer; at the end of the table sat the less old and honored guests, and there also, as part of the household, sat Pierre and Hélène—next to each other. Prince Vassily did not eat: he strolled around the table in a merry state of mind, sitting down now with one, now with another of the guests. To each he spoke a casual and agreeable word, except for Pierre and Hélène, whose presence he seemed not to notice. Prince Vassily enlivened everyone. The wax candles burned brightly, the silver and crystal, the ladies' gowns, and the gold and silver epaulettes shone; servants in red kaftans scurried around the table; the sounds of knives, glasses, plates were heard, and the sounds of animated talk in several conversations around that table. An old chamberlain was heard at one end assuring a little old baroness of his ardent love for her, and so, too, was her laughter; at the other end, the story of the unsuccess of some Marya Viktorovna. At the middle of the table Prince Vassily concentrated listeners around himself. He was telling the ladies, with a jocular smile on his lips, about the latest session—on Wednesday—of the state council, at which Sergei Kuzmich Vyazmitinov, the new military governor general of Petersburg, had received and read the then-famous rescript of the sovereign Alexander Pavlovich from the army, in which the sovereign, addressing Sergei Kuzmich, said that he had received declarations of the people's devotion from all sides, and that the declaration from Petersburg was especially pleasing to him, that he was proud of the honor of being the head of such a nation and would try to prove worthy of it. The rescript began with the words: “Sergei Kuzmich! From all sides rumors reach me,” and so on.","The visitors were seated at supper. Princess Kuragina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome, was sitting at the head of the table. On either side of her sat the more important guests—an old general and his wife, and Anna Pavlovna Scherer.

Prince Vasili was not having any supper: he went round the table in a merry mood sitting down now by one now by another of the guests. To each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to Pierre and Hélène, whose presence he seemed not to notice. He enlivened the whole party. The wax candles burned brightly, the silver and crystal gleamed, so did the ladies’ toilettes and the gold and silver of the men’s epaulettes; servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table, and the clatter of plates, knives, and glasses, mingled with the animated hum of several conversations. At one end of the table an old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately at which she laughed; at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of some Marya Viktorovna or other. At the centre of the table Prince Vasili attracted everybody’s attention. With a facetious smile on his face he was telling the ladies about last Wednesday’s meeting of the Imperial Council, at which Sergei Kuzmich Vyazmitinov, the new military governor-general of Petersburg, had received and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander from the army to Sergei Kuzmich, in which the Emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the people’s loyalty, that the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure, and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavour to be worthy of it.

"«Так вы до сих пор не замечали, как я прекрасна? — как будто сказала Элен. — Вы не замечали, что я женщина? Да, я женщина, которая может принадлежать всякому и вам тоже», сказал ее взгляд.

Have you noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who can belong to anyone, and to you too,” said her look. And at that very moment Pierre felt that Helen not only could, but should have been his wife, that it could not be otherwise.","“So you never noticed before how beautiful I am?” Hélène seemed to say. “You never noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who could belong to anyone, even you,” said her gaze.

"— Продай матушку, — ударяя на последнем слоге, говорил другой солдат, обращаясь к немцу, который, опустив глаза, сердито и испуганно шел широким шагом.","“Sell your mother,” another soldier said, striking on the last syllable, addressing the German, who, with lowered eyes, walked angrily and frightened with a long stride.","“Sell me the little lady,” another soldier said, with a stress on the last syllable, addressing the German, who, lowering his eyes, walked on with big strides, angry and frightened.","‘Sell me the missis,’ said another soldier, addressing the German, who angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast eyes."

"Прошло несколько минут суетни около высокой кровати; люди, несшие больного, разошлись. Анна Михайловна дотронулась до руки Пьера и сказала ему: «Venez». [Идите. ] Пьер вместе с нею подошел к кровати, на которой, в праздничной позе, видимо, имевшей отношение к только-что совершенному таинству, был положен больной. Он лежал, высоко опираясь головой на подушки. Руки его были симметрично выложены на зеленом шелковом одеяле ладонями вниз. Когда Пьер подошел, граф глядел прямо на него, но глядел тем взглядом, которого смысл и значение нельзя понять человеку. Или этот взгляд ровно ничего не говорил, как только то, что, покуда есть глаза, надо же глядеть куда-нибудь, или он говорил слишком многое. Пьер остановился, не зная, что ему делать, и вопросительно оглянулся на свою руководительницу Анну Михайловну. Анна Михайловна сделала ему торопливый жест глазами, указывая на руку больного и губами посылая ей воздушный поцелуй. Пьер, старательно вытягивая шею, чтоб не зацепить за одеяло, исполнил ее совет и приложился к ширококостной и мясистой руке. Ни рука, ни один мускул лица графа не дрогнули. Пьер опять вопросительно посмотрел на Анну Михайловну, спрашивая теперь, что ему делать. Анна Михайловна глазами указала ему на кресло, стоявшее подле кровати. Пьер покорно стал садиться на кресло, глазами продолжая спрашивать, то ли он сделал, что нужно. Анна Михайловна одобрительно кивнула головой. Пьер принял опять симметрично-наивное положение египетской статуи, видимо, соболезнуя о том, что неуклюжее и толстое тело его занимало такое большое пространство, и употребляя все душевные силы, чтобы казаться как можно меньше. Он смотрел на графа. Граф смотрел на то место, где находилось лицо Пьера, в то время как он стоял. Анна Михайловна являла в своем положении сознание трогательной важности этой последней минуты свидания отца с сыном. Это продолжалось две минуты, которые показались Пьеру часом. Вдруг в крупных мускулах и морщинах лица графа появилось содрогание. Содрогание усиливалось, красивый рот покривился (тут только Пьер понял, до какой степени отец его был близок к смерти), из перекривленного рта послышался неясный хриплый звук. Анна Михайловна старательно смотрела в глаза больному и, стараясь угадать, чего было нужно ему, указывала то на Пьера, то на питье, то шопотом вопросительно называла князя Василия, то указывала на одеяло. Глаза и лицо больного выказывали нетерпение. Он сделал усилие, чтобы взглянуть на слугу, который безотходно стоял у изголовья постели.","A few minutes of fuss passed by the high bed; the people carrying the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikhailovna touched Pierre's hand and said to him: ""Venez."" [Go. ] Pierre, together with her, went up to the bed, on which, in a festive pose, apparently related to the sacrament just completed, the patient was laid. He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His hands were symmetrically laid out on a green silk blanket, palms down. When Pierre approached, the count looked directly at him, but looked with that look, the meaning and significance of which cannot be understood by a person. Either this glance said absolutely nothing, only that, as long as there are eyes, one must look somewhere, or it said too much. Pierre stopped, not knowing what to do, and looked inquiringly at his leader, Anna Mikhailovna. Anna Mikhailovna made a hurried gesture to him with her eyes, pointing to the patient's hand and blowing a kiss to it with her lips. Pierre, diligently stretching his neck so as not to catch on the blanket, carried out her advice and kissed her large-boned and fleshy hand. Not a hand, not a single muscle of the count's face trembled. Pierre again looked inquiringly at Anna Mikhailovna, now asking what he should do. Anna Mikhaylovna pointed out to him with her eyes a chair that stood beside the bed. Pierre obediently began to sit down on an armchair, continuing to ask with his eyes whether he had done what was needed. Anna Mikhailovna nodded her head approvingly. Pierre again assumed the symmetrically naive position of the Egyptian statue, apparently condoling that his clumsy and fat body occupied such a large space, and using all his mental strength to appear as small as possible. He looked at the count. The count looked at the place where Pierre's face was, while he stood. Anna Mikhaylovna, in her position, displayed a consciousness of the touching importance of this last minute of meeting between father and son. This lasted two minutes, which seemed to Pierre an hour. Suddenly a shudder appeared in the large muscles and wrinkles of the count's face. The shudder intensified, the beautiful mouth twisted (it was only then that Pierre realized to what extent his father was close to death), an indistinct hoarse sound was heard from the twisted mouth. Anna Mikhailovna diligently looked into the patient's eyes and, trying to guess what he needed, she pointed either to Pierre, then to the drink, then in a whisper she called Prince Vasily inquiringly, then she pointed to the blanket. The patient's eyes and face showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the servant, who was standing at the head of the bed without leaving.","Several minutes were spent bustling around the high bed; the people who had carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikhailovna touched Pierre's arm and said: “Venez. ”[135] Together with her, Pierre went up to the bed, on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose, evidently having to do with the just-received sacrament. He lay with his head resting on the highly propped pillows. His hands were symmetrically laid out, palms down, on the green silk coverlet. When Pierre went up, the count looked straight at him, but looked with a gaze the meaning and significance of which no man could possibly understand. Either this gaze said nothing at all, except that as long as one has eyes one must look somewhere, or it said all too much. Pierre stood there not knowing what to do, and looked questioningly at his guide, Anna Mikhailovna. Anna Mikhailovna made a hasty gesture with her eyes, indicating the sick man's hand and sending it an airborne kiss with her lips. Pierre, diligently stretching his neck so as not to snag the coverlet, followed her advice and put his lips to the wide-boned and fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count's face stirred. Pierre again looked questioningly at Anna Mikhailovna, asking what he was to do now. Anna Mikhailovna pointed him with her eyes to an armchair that stood by the bed. Pierre obediently began to sit down in the chair, his eyes still asking whether he was doing the right thing. Anna Mikhailovna nodded her head approvingly. Pierre again assumed the symmetrically naïve pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently regretting that his clumsy and fat body took up so much space, and applying all his inner forces to making himself seem as small as possible. He looked at the count. The count looked at the same place where Pierre's face had been when he was standing. Anna Mikhailovna's face expressed an awareness of the touching importance of this last-minute meeting of father and son. This went on for two minutes, which seemed like an hour to Pierre. Suddenly a shuddering came over the big muscles and furrows of the count's face. The shuddering increased, the handsome mouth became contorted (only here did Pierre realize how close to death his father was), a vague, hoarse sound came from the contorted mouth. Anna Mikhailovna diligently looked into the sick man's eyes, trying to guess what he wanted, pointed to Pierre, then to the drink, then in a questioning whisper named Prince Vassily, then pointed to the coverlet. The sick man's eyes and face showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the servant who never left his post at the head of the bed.","After a few minutes’ bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikhailovna touched Pierre’s hand and said ‘Venez’.1 Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed. He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms downwards. When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man. Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna Mikhailovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick man’s hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre, carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large-boned, fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count’s face stirred. Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikhailovna to see what he was to do next. Anna Mikhailovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing right. Anna Mikhailovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell into the naively symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible. He looked at the count, who still gazed at the spot where Pierre’s face had been before he sat down. Anna Mikhailovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count’s face began to twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna Mikhailovna looked attentively at the sick man’s eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince Vasili in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the quilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed."
"Князь Андрей с улыбкой посматривал то на Пьера, то на виконта, то на хозяйку. В первую минуту выходки Пьера Анна Павловна ужаснулась, несмотря на свою привычку к свету; но когда она увидела, что, несмотря на произнесенные Пьером святотатственные речи, виконт не выходил из себя, и когда она убедилась, что замять этих речей уже нельзя, она собралась с силами и, присоединившись к виконту, напала на оратора.","Prince Andrei looked with a smile first at Pierre, then at the viscount, then at the hostess. At the first minute of Pierre's antics, Anna Pavlovna was horrified, despite her habit of being in the world; but when she saw that, despite the blasphemous speeches uttered by Pierre, the viscount did not lose his temper, and when she was convinced that it was no longer possible to hush up these speeches, she gathered her strength and, joining the viscount, attacked the speaker.","Prince Andrei kept glancing with a smile now at Pierre, now at the viscount, now at the hostess. For the first moment of Pierre's outburst, Anna Pavlovna was horrified, accustomed though she was to society; but when she saw that despite the blasphemous speeches uttered by Pierre, the viscount did not lose his temper, and when she became certain that it was now impossible to suppress these speeches, she gathered her forces and, joining the viscount, attacked the orator.","Prince Andrei kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of Pierre’s outburst Anna Pavlovna, despite her social experience, was horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre’s sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator."

"— Я вот что думаю. Австрия осталась в дурах, а она к этому не привыкла. И она отплатит.
