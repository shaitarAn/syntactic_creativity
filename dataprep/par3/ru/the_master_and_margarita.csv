"Гм... Да... Ни о каких поездах не может быть и разговора. Но что же тогда? Истребитель? Кто и в какой истребитель пустит Степу без сапог? Зачем? Может быть, он снял сапоги, прилетев в Ялту? То же самое: зачем? Да и в сапогах в истребитель его не пустят! Да и истребитель тут ни при чем. Ведь писано же, что явился в угрозыск в половине двенадцатого дня, а разговаривал он по телефону в Москве... позвольте-ка... тут перед глазами Римского возник циферблат его часов... Он припоминал, где были стрелки. Ужас! Это было в двадцать минут двенадцатого. Так что же это выходит? Если предположить, что мгновенно после разговора Степа кинулся на аэродром и достиг его за пять, скажем, минут, что, между прочим, тоже немыслимо, то выходит, что самолет, снявшись тут же, в пять минут покрыл более тысячи километров? Следовательно, в час он покрывает более двенадцати тысяч километров!!! Этого не может быть, а значит, его нет в Ялте.","Hm... Yes... There can be no talk of any trains. But what then? Fighter? Who and in which fighter will let Styopa go without boots? What for? Maybe he took off his boots when he flew to Yalta? The same: why? And they won’t let him into a fighter in boots! Yes, and the fighter has nothing to do with it. After all, it is written that he appeared at the criminal investigation department at half past twelve in the afternoon, and he was talking on the phone in Moscow ... let me see ... then the dial of his watch appeared before Rimsky's eyes ... He remembered where the arrows were. Horror! It was at twenty past eleven. So what does it come out with? If we assume that immediately after the conversation, Styopa rushed to the airfield and reached it in, say, five minutes, which, by the way, is also unthinkable, then it turns out that the plane, having taken off immediately, covered more than a thousand kilometers in five minutes? Therefore, it covers more than twelve thousand kilometers per hour!!! This cannot be, which means that he is not in Yalta.","Hmm … Yes … Trains were out of the question. But what then? A fighter plane? Who would let Styopa on a fighter plane without shoes? Why? Maybe he took off his shoes when he arrived in Yalta. Again: why? Besides, they wouldn’t have let him on a fighter plane even with shoes! And what did a fighter plane have to do with it? Still, they had it in writing that he appeared at the Criminal Investigation Department at 11:30 in the morning, but he was talking on the phone in Moscow … wait a minute … at that point the face of Rimsky’s watch suddenly appeared before his eyes … He remembered where the hands had been. God! It had been 11:20. So where does that leave us? If we assume that Styopa left for the airport right after our conversation and got there in, say, five minutes, which, by the way, is also inconceivable, then we are left to conclude that the plane took off right on the spot and covered more than 1000 kilometers in just five minutes?! Meaning that it traveled at more than 1200 kilometers per hour!! That’s impossible, so he can’t be in Yalta.","Hm ... Yes ... There could be no question of any trains. But what then? Some fighter plane? Who would let Styopa on any fighter plane without his shoes? What for? Maybe he took his shoes off when he got to Yalta? It’s the same thing : what for? And even with his shoes on they wouldn’t have let him on a fighter! And what has the fighter got to do with it? It’s written that he came to the investigators at half past eleven in the morning, and he talked on the telephone in Moscow ... excuse me ... (the face of Rimsky’s watch emerged before his eyes). Rimsky tried to remember where the hands had been ... Terrible! It had been twenty minutes past eleven! So what does it boil down to? If one supposes that after the conversation Styopa instantly rushed to the airport, and reached it in, say, five minutes (which, incidentally, was also unthinkable), it means that the plane, taking off at once, covered nearly a thousand miles in five minutes. Consequently, it was flying at twelve thousand miles an hour!!! That cannot be, and that means he’s not in Yalta!"

"Тут что-то дунуло в лицо бывшему сборщику и что-то зашелестело у него под ногами. Дунуло еще раз, и тогда, открыв глаза, Левий увидел, что все в мире, под влиянием ли его проклятий или в силу каких-либо других причин, изменилось. Солнце исчезло, не дойдя до моря, в котором тонуло ежевечерне. Поглотив его, по небу с запада поднималась грозно и неуклонно грозовая туча. Края ее уже вскипали белой пеной, черное дымное брюхо отсвечивало желтым. Туча ворчала, и из нее время от времени вываливались огненные нити. По Яффской дороге, по скудной Гионской долине, над шатрами богомольцев, гонимые внезапно поднявшимся ветром, летели пыльные столбы. Левий умолк, стараясь сообразить, принесет ли гроза, которая сейчас накроет Ершалаим, какое-либо изменение в судьбе несчастного Иешуа. И тут же, глядя на нити огня, раскраивающие тучу, стал просить, чтобы молния ударила в столб Иешуа. В раскаянии глядя в чистое небо, которое еще не пожрала туча и где стервятники ложились на крыло, чтобы уходить от грозы, Левий подумал, что безумно поспешил со своими проклятиями. Теперь бог не послушает его.","Then something blew in the face of the former assembler and something rustled under his feet. It blew again, and then, opening his eyes, Levi saw that everything in the world, whether under the influence of his curses or for some other reason, had changed. The sun disappeared before reaching the sea, in which it sank every evening. Having swallowed it, a thundercloud rose menacingly and steadily across the sky from the west. Its edges were already churning with white foam, its black smoky belly glowing yellow. The cloud grumbled, and from time to time fiery threads fell out of it. Along the Jaffa road, along the meager Gion valley, above the tents of the pilgrims, driven by a suddenly rising wind, dusty pillars flew. Levi fell silent, trying to figure out whether the storm that would now cover Yershalaim would bring any change in the fate of the unfortunate Yeshua. And then, looking at the threads of fire cutting the cloud, he began to ask that lightning strike Yeshua's pillar. Looking in repentance at the clear sky, which had not yet been devoured by a cloud, and where the vultures lay down on their wings to get away from the thunderstorm, Levi thought that he was madly hasty with his curses. Now God will not listen to him.","At this point something blew in the face of the former tax collector and something stirred beneath his feet.

White foam bubbled around its edges, and its smoky black belly was fringed with yellow. The cloud rumbled from time to time and emitted streaks of fire. The wind that had suddenly blown up chased spirals of dust down the Jaffa road, across the sparse Valley of Gion, and over the pilgrims’ tents. Levi fell silent and wondered whether the thunderstorm about to envelop Yershalaim would have any effect on poor Yeshua’s fate. And as he gazed at the streaks of fire that were splitting open the stormcloud, he begged for the lightning to strike Yeshua’s post. Levi looked repentantly at the clear part of the sky not yet devoured by the stormcloud, where the vultures had flown in order to escape the thunder and lightning, and he thought that he had been much too hasty with his curses. Now God would not listen to him.","Here something blew into the face of the former tax collector, and something rustled under his feet.

"Иванушка лежал неподвижно, как и тогда, когда первый раз наблюдал грозу в доме своего отдохновения. Но он не плакал, как в тот раз.

"Теперь снизу уже стеною шел народ, как бы штурмуя площадку, на которой стояла Маргарита. Голые женские тела поднимались между фрачными мужчинами. На Маргариту наплывали их смуглые, и белые, и цвета кофейного зерна, и вовсе черные тела. В волосах рыжих, черных, каштановых, светлых, как лен, – в ливне света играли и плясали, рассыпали искры драгоценные камни. И как будто кто-то окропил штурмующую колонну мужчин капельками света, – с грудей брызгали светом бриллиантовые запонки. Теперь Маргарита ежесекундно ощущала прикосновение губ к колену, ежесекундно вытягивала вперед руку для поцелуя, лицо ее стянуло в неподвижную маску привета.","Now the people were already marching from below like a wall, as if storming the platform on which Margarita was standing.

And it was as if someone had sprinkled drops of light on the assaulting column of men—diamond cufflinks were splashing light from their breasts. Now Margarita every second felt the touch of her lips on her knee, every second she stretched out her hand for a kiss, her face was drawn into a motionless mask of greeting.","A wall of people was now advancing up the staircase as if about to storm the landing where Margarita stood. Naked female bodies moved up the stairs in between tailcoated men. Their bodies—swarthy, white, coffee-colored or completely black—swept up against Margarita.

And the advancing column of men looked as if it had been sprayed with droplets of light—light splashed by the diamond studs on their chests. Now every second Margarita felt the touch of lips against her knee, every second she stretched out her hand to be kissed, her face tensed in a mask of welcome.","Now people were coming in a solid wall from below, as if storming the landing where Margarita stood.

"Добравшись до столбов, уже по щиколотку в воде, он содрал с себя отяжелевший, пропитанный водою таллиф, остался в одной рубахе и припал к ногам Иешуа. Он перерезал веревки на голенях, поднялся на нижнюю перекладину, обнял Иешуа и освободил руки от верхних связей. Голое влажное тело Иешуа обрушилось на Левия и повалило его наземь. Левий тут же хотел взвалить его на плечи, но какая-то мысль остановила его.

"Как только первый куплет пришел к концу, пение стихло внезапно, опять-таки как бы по жезлу дирижера. Курьер тихо выругался и скрылся. Тут открылись парадные двери, и в них появился гражданин в летнем пальто, из-под которого торчали полы белого халата, а с ним милиционер.","As soon as the first verse came to an end, the singing ceased suddenly, again, as if on the conductor's baton.

"Разговор этот шел на закате солнца, как раз тогда, когда к Воланду явился Левий Матвей на террасе. Окошко подвала было открыто, и если бы кто-нибудь заглянул в него, он удивился бы тому, насколько странно выглядят разговаривающие. На Маргарите прямо на голое тело был накинут черный плащ, а мастер был в своем больничном белье. Происходило это оттого, что Маргарите решительно нечего было надеть, так как все ее вещи остались в особняке, и хоть этот особняк был очень недалеко, конечно, нечего было и толковать о том, чтобы пойти туда и взять там свои вещи. А мастер, у которого все костюмы нашли в шкафу, как будто мастер никуда и не уезжал, просто не желал одеваться, развивая перед Маргаритой ту мысль, что вот-вот начнется какая-то совершеннейшая чепуха. Правда, он был выбрит впервые, считая с той осенней ночи (в клинике бородку ему подстригали машинкой).","This conversation was going on at sunset, just when Matvey Levi appeared to Woland on the terrace. The basement window was open, and if anyone looked through it, he would be surprised at how strange the people who were talking looked. On Margarita, a black cloak was thrown right over her naked body, and the master was in his hospital linen. This happened because Margarita had absolutely nothing to wear, since all her things were left in the mansion, and although this mansion was very close, of course, there was nothing to talk about going there and taking your things there. And the master, in whom all the suits were found in the closet, as if the master had never left anywhere, simply did not want to dress, developing in front of Margarita the idea that some kind of perfect nonsense was about to begin. True, he was shaved for the first time, counting from that autumn night (in the clinic, his beard was trimmed with a typewriter).","This conversation took place at sunset just as Levi Matvei came to Woland on the terrace. The window of the basement apartment was open, and if anyone had glanced in, he would have been taken aback by the strange appearance of the two speakers. Margarita was wearing a black cape over her naked body, and the Master was in hospital under-clothes. This was because all Margarita’s things were back at her house and she had absolutely nothing else to wear, and although the house was not far away, there was, naturally, no question of her going back there to get her things. And the Master, all of whose suits were still in the closet as if he had never been away, simply did not feel like getting dressed, preoccupied as he was with telling Margarita that he was convinced something quite weird was about to happen. True, he was clean-shaven for the first time since that autumn night (his beard had been trimmed with clippers at the clinic).","This conversation occurred at sunset, just at the moment when Matthew Levi came to Woland on the terrace. The basement window was open, and if anyone had looked through it, he would have been astonished at how strange the talkers looked. Margarita had a black cloak thrown directly over her naked body, and the master was in his hospital underwear. The reason for this was that Margarita had decidedly nothing to put on, because all her clothes had stayed in her house, and though this house was very near by, there was, of course, no question of going there to take her clothes. And the master, whose clothes were all found in the wardrobe as if he had never gone anywhere, simply did not want to get dressed, developing before Margarita the thought that some perfect nonsense was about to begin at any moment. True, he was clean-shaven for the first time since that autumn night (in the clinic his beard had been cut with clippers)."

And, enlisting in his sleep the nod of the beggar from En-Sarid walking beside him, the cruel procurator of Judea wept and laughed with joy in his sleep.","“Yes, please don’t forget, remember me, the son of an astrologer-king,” implored Pilate in his sleep.

"– От всей души желаю, чтобы они скорее кончились, – энергично добавил Пилат. – Я получу возможность наконец вернуться в Кесарию. Верите ли, это бредовое сооружение Ирода, – прокуратор махнул рукою вдоль колоннады, так что стало ясно, что он говорит о дворце, – положительно сводит меня с ума. Я не могу ночевать в нем.

"Втирания изменили ее не только внешне. Теперь в ней во всей, в каждой частице тела, вскипала радость, которую она ощутила, как пузырьки, колющие все ее тело. Маргарита ощутила себя свободной, свободной от всего. Кроме того, она поняла со всей ясностью, что именно случилось то, о чем утром говорило предчувствие, и что она покидает особняк и прежнюю свою жизнь навсегда. Но от этой прежней жизни все же откололась одна мысль о том, что нужно исполнить только один последний долг перед началом чего-то нового, необыкновенного, тянущего ее наверх, в воздух. И она, как была нагая, из спальни, то и дело взлетая на воздух, перебежала в кабинет мужа и, осветив его, кинулась к письменному столу. На вырванном из блокнота листе она без помарок быстро и крупно карандашом написала записку:","Rubbing changed her not only outwardly. Now in her everything, in every particle of her body, joy boiled up, which she felt like bubbles piercing her whole body. Margarita felt free, free from everything. In addition, she understood with all clarity that exactly what the presentiment spoke of in the morning had happened, and that she was leaving the mansion and her former life forever. But from this former life, nevertheless, one thought broke away that there was only one last duty to fulfill before the start of something new, extraordinary, pulling her up into the air. And she, as she was naked, from the bedroom, now and then taking off into the air, ran across to her husband's study and, illuminating it, rushed to the desk. On a sheet torn from a notebook, she wrote a note quickly and in large pencil without blots:","The cream had transformed more than her appearance. Now her whole body, every part of it, surged with joy, and she felt as if tiny bubbles were prickling her all over. Margarita felt free, free of everything. In addition, she realized with utter clarity that her premonition of the morning had come true and she was leaving her house and her former life forever. But one thought from that former life still persisted, namely, that there was one last thing she had to do before embarking on the new and extraordinary something that was pulling her upward, into the air. So, naked as she was, flying intermittently, she ran out of the bedroom into her husband’s study, turned on the lights, and rushed to the desk. On a sheet of paper torn off a pad, she wrote in pencil, quickly and boldly and without any corrections, the following note:","The rubbings changed her not only externally. Now joy was boiling up in her, in all of her, in every particle of her body, which felt to her like bubbles prickling her body all over. Margarita felt herself free, free of everything.

But, even so, a thought split off from this former life about the need of fulfilling just one last duty before the start of something new, extraordinary, which was pulling her upwards into the air. And, naked as she was, she ran from her bedroom, flying up in the air time and again, to her husband’s study, and, turning on the light, rushed to the desk.

"Статьи не прекращались. Над первыми из них я смеялся. Но чем больше их появлялось, тем более менялось мое отношение к ним. Второй стадией была стадия удивления. Что-то на редкость фальшивое и неуверенное чувствовалось буквально в каждой строчке этих статей, несмотря на их грозный и уверенный тон. Мне все казалось, – и я не мог от этого отделаться, – что авторы этих статей говорят не то, что они хотят сказать, и что их ярость вызывается именно этим. А затем, представьте себе, наступила третья стадия – страха. Нет, не страха этих статей, поймите, а страха перед другими, совершенно не относящимися к ним или к роману вещами. Так, например, я стал бояться темноты. Словом, наступила стадия психического заболевания. Стоило мне перед сном потушить лампу в маленькой комнате, как мне казалось, что через оконце, хотя оно и было закрыто, влезает какой-то спрут с очень длинными и холодными щупальцами. И спать мне пришлось с огнем.","The articles didn't stop. I laughed at the first of them. But the more they appeared, the more my attitude towards them changed. The second stage was the surprise stage. Something extremely false and uncertain was felt literally in every line of these articles, despite their formidable and confident tone. It seemed to me - and I could not get rid of it - that the authors of these articles were not saying what they wanted to say, and that it was precisely this that provoked their rage. And then, imagine, the third stage came - fear. No, not fear of these articles, understand, but fear of other things that are completely unrelated to them or to the novel. For example, I became afraid of the dark. In a word, the stage of mental illness has come. As soon as I put out the lamp in a small room before going to bed, it seemed to me that through the window, although it was closed, some kind of octopus with very long and cold tentacles climbs in. And I had to sleep with fire.","“The articles, take note, did not cease. The first ones made me laugh, but the more of them there were, the more my attitude to them changed. The next stage was amazement. There was something uncommonly fake and uncertain in every line of these articles, despite their threatening and self-assured tone. I kept thinking—and I couldn’t rid myself of the thought—that the authors of these articles weren’t saying what they wanted to say, and that that was why they were so furious. And then, imagine, a third stage set in: fear. No, not fear of the articles, mind you, but fear of things totally unrelated to either the articles or the novel. For example, I started being afraid of the dark. In short, the stage of mental illness had set in. It seemed to me, especially when I was going to sleep, that some octopus with supple and cold tentacles was stealing up to me, coming straight for my heart. So I had to sleep with the light on.","‘The articles, please note, did not cease. I laughed at the first of them. But the more of them that appeared, the more my attitude towards them changed.

I had the feeling, and I couldn’t get rid of it, that the authors of these articles were not saying what they wanted to say, and that their rage sprang precisely from that.

"– Вы, прокуратор, слишком лестно отзывались обо мне. По-моему, я не заслуживаю вашего доклада. У меня этих сведений нет.","“You, procurator, spoke too flatteringly of me. I don't think I deserve your report. I don't have this information.","Here the guest not only fixed the procurator with his gaze, he even held it there for a while, and then replied, “You have given too flattering an account of me, Procurator. In my opinion I do not deserve your recommendation. I have no such information.”","‘You spoke too flatteringly of me, Procurator. In my opinion, I do not deserve your report.

"Опять-таки виновата была, вероятно, кровь, прилившая к вискам и застучавшая в них, только у прокуратора что-то случилось со зрением. Так, померещилось ему, что голова арестанта уплыла куда-то, а вместо нее появилась другая. На этой плешивой голове сидел редкозубый золотой венец; на лбу была круглая язва, разъедающая кожу и смазанная мазью; запавший беззубый рот с отвисшей нижней капризною губой. Пилату показалось, что исчезли розовые колонны балкона и кровли Ершалаима вдали, внизу за садом, и все утонуло вокруг в густейшей зелени Капрейских садов. И со слухом совершилось что-то странное, как будто вдали проиграли негромко и грозно трубы и очень явственно послышался носовой голос, надменно тянущий слова: «Закон об оскорблении величества...»","Again, it was probably the blood that rushed to the temples and pounded in them, only something happened to the procurator's eyesight. So, it seemed to him that the head of the prisoner floated away somewhere, and another appeared instead of it. On this bald head sat a rare-toothed golden crown; there was a round ulcer on the forehead, corroding the skin and smeared with ointment; a sunken, toothless mouth with a drooping, capricious lower lip. It seemed to Pilate that the pink columns of the balcony and the roofs of Yershalaim disappeared in the distance, below behind the garden, and everything around him was drowned in the thickest greenery of the Kaprian gardens. And something strange happened to the ear, as if in the distance trumpets were playing softly and menacingly, and a nasal voice was very clearly heard, arrogantly drawing out the words: “The law of lèse majest...”","The blood pouring and pounding into his temples was probably also responsible for what had happened to the procurator’s vision. He seemed to see the prisoner’s head float off somewhere, and another head appear in its place. On top of this bald head was a gold crown with widely-spaced points. On the forehead was a round sore, eating away at the skin and smeared with ointment. The mouth was sunken and toothless, with a capricious and protruding lower lip. Pilate had the feeling that the rose columns on the balcony had disappeared as had the roofs of Yershalaim in the distance below the garden, and that everything around him had drowned in the thick greenery of the Capreaean gardens. And something strange had happened to his hearing too—trumpets seemed to be sounding softly and menacingly in the distance and a nasal voice was clearly heard, haughtily intoning the words, “The law pertaining to insults to the sovereign …”","Again it was probably owing to the blood rising to his temples and throbbing in them, only something happened to the procurator’s vision. Thus, he imagined that the prisoner’s head floated off somewhere, and another appeared in its place.21 On this bald head sat a scant-pointed golden diadem. On the forehead was a round canker, eating into the skin and smeared with ointment. A sunken, toothless mouth with a pendulous, capricious lower lip. It seemed to Pilate that the pink columns of the balcony and the rooftops of Yershalaim far below, beyond the garden, vanished, and everything was drowned in the thickest green of Caprean gardens.

A light shadow of a flying woman glided over the ground in front - now the moon shone in Margarita's back.","Margarita flew slowly, as before, in a deserted and unfamiliar locale, over hills dotted with occasional boulders and isolated giant firs.

В этом театре ему уже не пришлось сталкиваться по делам акустики с почтеннейшим Аркадием Аполлоновичем Семплеяровым. Того в два счета перебросили в Брянск и назначили заведующим грибнозаготовочным пунктом. Едят теперь Москвичи соленые рыжики и маринованные белые и не нахвалятся ими и до чрезвычайности радуются этой переброске.

Now Muscovites eat his salted saffron milkcaps and marinated white mushrooms, praise them to the skies, and could not be more delighted about his transfer.

"Маргарита Николаевна сидела перед трюмо в одном купальном халате, наброшенном на голое тело, и в замшевых черных туфлях. Золотой браслет с часиками лежал перед Маргаритой Николаевной рядом с коробочкой, полученной от Азазелло, и Маргарита не сводила глаз с циферблата. Временами ей начинало казаться, что часы сломались и стрелки не движутся. Но они двигались, хотя и очень медленно, как будто прилипая, и наконец <длинная стрелка упала на двадцать девятую минуту десятого>. Сердце Маргариты страшно стукнуло, так что она не смогла даже сразу взяться за коробочку. Справившись с собою, Маргарита открыла ее и увидела в коробочке жирный желтоватый крем. Ей показалось, что он пахнет болотной тиной. Кончиком пальца Маргарита выложила небольшой мазочек крема на ладонь, причем сильнее запахло болотными травами и лесом, и затем ладонью начала втирать крем в лоб и щеки. Крем легко мазался и, как показалось Маргарите, тут же испарялся. Сделав несколько втираний, Маргарита глянула в зеркало и уронила коробочку прямо на стекло часов, от чего оно покрылось трещинами. Маргарита закрыла глаза, потом глянула еще раз и бурно расхохоталась.","Margarita Nikolaevna was sitting in front of the dressing table in only a bathrobe thrown over her naked body, and in black suede shoes.

But they moved, albeit very slowly, as if sticking, and finally <the long arrow fell at the twenty-ninth minute of the tenth>. Margarita's heart pounded terribly, so that she could not even immediately take up the box. Having controlled herself, Margarita opened it and saw in the box a fat yellowish cream. It seemed to her that he smelled of swamp slime. With the tip of her finger, Margarita put a small smear of cream on her palm, with a stronger smell of marsh herbs and forest, and then with her palm she began to rub the cream on her forehead and cheeks.

"В течение ее полета в светлой теперь и легкой голове прокуратора сложилась формула. Она была такова: игемон разобрал дело бродячего философа Иешуа по кличке Га-Ноцри, и состава преступления в нем не нашел. В частности, не нашел ни малейшей связи между действиями Иешуа и беспорядками, происшедшими в Ершалаиме недавно. Бродячий философ оказался душевнобольным. Вследствие этого смертный приговор Га-Ноцри, вынесенный Малым Синедрионом, прокуратор не утверждает. Но ввиду того, что безумные, утопические речи Га-Ноцри могут быть причиною волнений в Ершалаиме, прокуратор удаляет Иешуа из Ершалаима и подвергает его заключению в Кесарии Стратоновой на Средиземном море, то есть именно там, где резиденция прокуратора.","In the course of her flight, a formula formed in the procurator's now bright and light head. It was as follows: the hegemon examined the case of the wandering philosopher Yeshua, nicknamed Ha-Notsri, and did not find corpus delicti in it. In particular, I did not find the slightest connection between the actions of Yeshua and the riots that took place in Yershalaim recently. The wandering philosopher turned out to be mentally ill. As a result of this, the procurator does not approve the death sentence of Ha-Notsri, pronounced by the Small Sanhedrin. But in view of the fact that the insane, utopian speeches of Ga-Nozri can be the cause of unrest in Yershalaim, the procurator removes Yeshua from Yershalaim and subjects him to imprisonment in Caesarea Stratonova on the Mediterranean Sea, that is, exactly where the residence of the procurator is.","During the swallow’s flight, the following thought was taking shape in the procurator’s now bright and clear head: the Hegemon had looked into the case of the vagrant philosopher Yeshua, called Ha-Notsri, and found the criminal charges against him to be unsubstantiated. Specifically, he found no connection whatsoever between Yeshua’s actions and the recent disorders in Yershalaim. The vagrant philosopher turned out to be mentally ill. In consequence of which, the procurator does not confirm the death sentence pronounced against Ha-Notsri by the Lesser Sinedrion. However, in view of the fact that Ha-Notsri’s insane, utopian speeches might cause unrest in Yershalaim, the procurator is removing Yeshua from Yershalaim and sentencing him to confinement in Strato’s Caesarea on the Mediterranean, that is, the site of the procurator’s residence.","During its flight, a formula took shape in the now light and lucid head of the procurator. It went like this: the hegemon has looked into the case of the vagrant philosopher Yeshua, alias Ha-Nozri, and found in it no grounds for indictment. In particular, he has found not the slightest connection between the acts of Yeshua and the disorders that have lately taken place in Yershalaim. The vagrant philosopher has proved to be mentally ill. Consequently, the procurator has not confirmed the death sentence on Ha-Nozri passed by the Lesser Sanhedrin. But seeing that Ha-Nozri’s mad utopian talk might cause disturbances in Yershalaim, the procurator is removing Yeshua from Yershalaim and putting him under confinement in Stratonian Caesarea on the Mediterranean — that is, precisely where the procurator’s residence was."

They see it, and you’re caught!’"

"Ложе было в полутьме, закрываемое от луны колонной, но от ступеней крыльца тянулась к постели лунная лента. И лишь только прокуратор потерял связь с тем, что было вокруг него в действительности, он немедленно тронулся по светящейся дороге и пошел по ней вверх прямо к луне. Он даже рассмеялся во сне от счастья, до того все сложилось прекрасно и неповторимо на прозрачной голубой дороге. Он шел в сопровождении Банги, а рядом с ним шел бродячий философ. Они спорили о чем-то очень сложном и важном, причем ни один из них не мог победить другого. Они ни в чем не сходились друг с другом, и от этого их спор был особенно интересен и нескончаем. Само собой разумеется, что сегодняшняя казнь оказалась чистейшим недоразумением – ведь вот же философ, выдумавший столь невероятно нелепую вещь вроде того, что все люди добрые, шел рядом, следовательно, он был жив. И, конечно, совершенно ужасно было бы даже помыслить о том, что такого человека можно казнить. Казни не было! Не было! Вот в чем прелесть этого путешествия вверх по лестнице луны.","The bed was in semi-darkness, shielded from the moon by a column, but from the steps of the porch a ribbon of moonlight stretched to the bed. And as soon as the procurator lost contact with what was around him in reality, he immediately set off along the luminous road and went along it straight up to the moon. He even laughed in his sleep with happiness, before that everything turned out perfectly and uniquely on the transparent blue road. He was accompanied by Bungui, and next to him was a wandering philosopher. They were arguing about something very difficult and important, and neither of them could defeat the other. They did not agree on anything with each other, and for this reason their dispute was especially interesting and never-ending. It goes without saying that today's execution turned out to be a pure misunderstanding - after all, the philosopher who invented such an incredibly absurd thing like the fact that all people are kind walked nearby, therefore, he was alive. And, of course, it would be absolutely terrible even to think that such a person could be executed. There was no punishment! Did not have! That's the beauty of this journey up the ladder of the moon.","The couch stood in semidarkness, shielded from the moon by a column, but a ribbon of moonlight stretched from the stairway to the bed.

He even laughed in his sleep with happiness, so splendid and unique was everything on that light-blue, transparent road. He was accompanied by Banga, and walking alongside him was the vagrant philosopher. They were arguing about something complex and important, and neither one of them could convince the other. They did not agree about anything, and that made their dispute all the more engaging and endless. Today’s execution, needless to say, turned out to have been a complete misunderstanding—after all, the philosopher who had conceived the absurd notion that all people were good was walking beside him, so he had to be alive. And besides, the very idea that such a man could be executed was utterly horrible. The execution had not taken place! No! Therein lay the charm of this journey up the stairway of the moon.","The couch was in semi-darkness, shielded from the moon by a column, but a ribbon of moonlight stretched from the porch steps to the bed. And once the procurator lost connection with what surrounded him in reality, he immediately set out on the shining road and went up it straight towards the moon. He even burst out laughing in his sleep from happiness, so wonderful and inimitable did everything come to be on the transparent, pale blue road. He walked in the company of Banga, and beside him walked the wandering philosopher. They were arguing about something very complex and important, and neither of them could refute the other.

Вихрь мыслей бушевал у него в голове. Тут вертелась и вилла в Ницце, и дрессированный кот, и мысль о том, что свидетелей действительно не было, и что Пелагея Антоновна обрадуется контрамарке.

All their names became jumbled in her head, the faces stuck together into one huge pancake, and only a single face lodged itself painfully in her memory — the face, framed in a truly fiery beard, of Maliuta Skuratov.14 Margarita’s legs kept giving way, she was afraid of bursting into tears at any moment. The worst suffering was caused by her right knee, which was being kissed. It became swollen, the skin turned blue, even though Natasha’s hand appeared by this knee several times with a sponge, wiping it with something fragrant. At the end of the third hour, Margarita glanced down with completely desperate eyes and gave a joyful start — the stream of guests was thinning out."

"Из камина подряд один за другим вывалились, лопаясь и распадаясь, три гроба, затем кто-то в черной мантии, которого следующий выбежавший из черной пасти ударил в спину ножом. Внизу послышался сдавленный крик. Из камина выбежал почти совсем разложившийся труп. Маргарита зажмурилась, и чья-то рука поднесла к ее носу флакон с белой солью. Маргарите показалось, что это рука Наташи. Лестница стала заполняться. Теперь уже на каждой ступеньке оказались, издали казавшиеся совершенно одинаковыми, фрачники и нагие женщины с ними, отличавшиеся друг от друга только цветом перьев на головах и туфель.","Three coffins fell out of the fireplace in a row, bursting and disintegrating, then someone in a black robe, whom the next one who ran out of the black mouth stabbed in the back with a knife. A strangled cry was heard from below. An almost completely decomposed corpse ran out of the fireplace. Margarita closed her eyes, and someone's hand brought a vial of white salt to her nose. It seemed to Margarita that it was Natasha's hand. The stairs started to fill up. Now on every step there were, from afar, seemingly identical, tailcoats and naked women with them, differing from each other only in the color of feathers on their heads and shoes.","One after the other, three coffins tumbled out of the fireplace, splitting open and breaking apart on impact, then someone in a black cloak appeared, who was then stabbed in the back by the next to follow him out of the black maw.

It seemed to Margarita that the hand was Natasha’s. The staircase began to fill up with people. Now on every step were men in tails, who all looked completely alike from a distance, and naked women who differed from one another only by their shoes and the color of the feathers on their heads.","Out of the fireplace, bursting open and falling apart, three coffins tumbled one after another, then came someone in a black mantle, whom the next one to run out of the black maw stabbed in the back with a knife.

"– Михаил Александрович, – негромко обратился Воланд к голове, и тогда веки убитого приподнялись, и на мертвом лице Маргарита, содрогнувшись, увидела живые, полные мысли и страдания глаза. – Все сбылось, не правда ли? – продолжал Воланд, глядя в глаза головы, – голова отрезана женщиной, заседание не состоялось, и живу я в вашей квартире. Это – факт. А факт – самая упрямая в мире вещь. Но теперь нас интересует дальнейшее, а не этот уже свершившийся факт. Вы всегда были горячим проповедником той теории, что по отрезании головы жизнь в человеке прекращается, он превращается в золу и уходит в небытие. Мне приятно сообщить вам, в присутствии моих гостей, хотя они и служат доказательством совсем другой теории, о том, что ваша теория и солидна и остроумна. Впрочем, ведь все теории стоят одна другой. Есть среди них и такая, согласно которой каждому будет дано по его вере. Да сбудется же это! Вы уходите в небытие, а мне радостно будет из чаши, в которую вы превращаетесь, выпить за бытие. – Воланд поднял шпагу. Тут же покровы головы потемнели и съежились, потом отвалились кусками, глаза исчезли, и вскоре Маргарита увидела на блюде желтоватый, с изумрудными глазами и жемчужными зубами, на золотой ноге, череп. Крышка черепа откинулась на шарнире.","“Mikhail Alexandrovich,” Woland turned softly to the head, and then the eyelids of the dead man lifted, and on the dead face Margarita, shuddering, saw living eyes full of thought and suffering. Everything came true, didn't it? Woland continued, looking into the eyes of the head, “the head was cut off by a woman, the meeting did not take place, and I live in your apartment. It is a fact. A fact is the most stubborn thing in the world. But now we are interested in the future, and not in this already accomplished fact. You have always been an ardent preacher of the theory that after cutting off the head, life in a person stops, he turns into ashes and disappears into oblivion. I am pleased to inform you, in the presence of my guests, although they serve as proof of a completely different theory, that your theory is both solid and witty. However, after all, all theories stand one another. There is one among them, according to which each will be given according to his faith. May it come true! You are going into non-existence, and I will be happy to drink from the cup into which you turn into, to drink for existence. Woland raised his sword. Immediately, the covers of the head darkened and shrank, then fell off in pieces, the eyes disappeared, and soon Margarita saw on a platter a yellowish skull with emerald eyes and pearl teeth, on a golden leg. The lid of the skull was hinged back.","“Mikhail Alexandrovich,” said Woland quietly to the head, and then the eyelids of the slain man opened, and Margarita shuddered when she saw that the eyes on the dead face were alive and full of thought and suffering. “Everything came true, didn’t it?” continued Woland, looking into the head’s eyes. “Your head was cut off by a woman, the meeting never took place, and I’m living in your apartment. That is a fact. And a fact is the most stubborn thing in the world. But now we’re interested in facts-to-be, rather than this already accomplished fact. You were always an avid proponent of the theory that after his head is cut off, a man’s life comes to an end, he turns to dust, and departs into nonbeing. I have the pleasure of informing you in the presence of my guests—although they actually serve as proof of a different theory altogether—that your theory is both incisive and sound. However, one theory is as good as another. There is even a theory that says that to each man it will be given according to his beliefs. May it be so! You are departing into nonbeing, and, from the goblet into which you are being transformed, I will have the pleasure of drinking a toast to being!” Woland raised his sword. Here, the skin covering the head darkened and shriveled, then fell off in pieces, the eyes disappeared, and soon Margarita saw on the dish a yellowish, emerald-eyed skull on a gold stem. The top of the skull opened on a hinge.","‘Mikhail Alexandrovich,’ Woland addressed the head in a low voice, and then the slain man’s eyelids rose, and on the dead face Margarita saw, with a shudder, living eyes filled with thought and suffering. ‘Everything came to pass, did it not?’ Woland went on, looking into the head’s eyes. ‘The head was cut off by a woman, the meeting did not take place, and I am living in your apartment. That is a fact. And fact is the most stubborn thing in the world. But we are now interested in what follows, and not in this already accomplished fact. You have always been an ardent preacher of the theory that, on the cutting off of his head, life ceases in a man, he turns to ashes and goes into non-being. I have the pleasure of informing you, in the presence of my guests, though they serve as proof of quite a different theory, that your theory is both solid and clever. However, one theory is as good as another. There is also one which holds that it will be given to each according to his faith.19 Let it come true! You go into non-being, and from the cup into which you are to be transformed, I will joyfully drink to being!’ Woland raised his sword. Straight away the flesh of the head turned dark and shrivelled, then fell off in pieces, the eyes disappeared, and soon Margarita saw on the platter a yellowish skull with emerald eyes, pearl teeth and a golden foot. The lid opened on a hinge."

"Так вот, как и было сказано, дело тянулось таким образом до субботнего рассвета. Тут прибавились новые и очень интересные данные. На московском аэродроме совершил посадку шестиместный пассажирский самолет, прилетевший из Крыма. Среди других пассажиров из него высадился один очень странный пассажир. Это был молодой гражданин, дико заросший щетиною, дня три не мывшийся, с воспаленными и испуганными глазами, без багажа и одетый несколько причудливо. Гражданин был в папахе, в бурке поверх ночной сорочки и синих ночных кожаных новеньких, только что купленных туфлях. Лишь только он отделился от лесенки, по которой спускались из кабины самолета, к нему подошли. Этого гражданина уже ждали, и через некоторое время незабвенный директор Варьете, Степан Богданович Лиходеев, предстал перед следствием. Он подсыпал новых данных. Теперь стало ясно, что Воланд проник в Варьете под видом артиста, загипнотизировав Степу Лиходеева, а затем ухитрился выбросить этого же Степу вон из Москвы за бог знает какое количество километров. Материалу, таким образом, прибавилось, но легче от этого не стало, а, пожалуй, стало даже чуть-чуть потяжелее, ибо очевидным становилось, что овладеть такой личностью, которая проделывает штуки вроде той, жертвой которой стал Степан Богданович, будет не так-то легко. Между прочим, Лиходеев, по собственной его просьбе, был заключен в надежную камеру, и перед следствием предстал Варенуха, только что арестованный на своей квартире, в которую он вернулся после безвестного отсутствия в течение почти двух суток.","So, as was said, the matter dragged on in this way until Saturday dawn. New and very interesting data has been added here. A six-seater passenger plane, which arrived from the Crimea, landed at the Moscow airfield. Among other passengers, one very strange passenger disembarked from it. He was a young citizen, wildly overgrown with stubble, had not washed for three days, with inflamed and frightened eyes, without luggage, and somewhat bizarrely dressed. The citizen was in a hat, in a cloak over a nightgown and blue night leather brand new, just bought shoes. As soon as he separated from the stairs, along which they descended from the cockpit, they approached him. This citizen was already expected, and after a while the unforgettable director of the Variety, Stepan Bogdanovich Likhodeev, appeared before the investigation. He poured in new data. Now it became clear that Woland had entered the Variety under the guise of an artist, having hypnotized Styopa Likhodeev, and then managed to throw the same Styopa out of Moscow for God knows how many kilometers. Thus, there was more material, but it didn’t get any easier, and, perhaps, it even became a little harder, because it became obvious that it would not be so it's easy. By the way, Likhodeev, at his own request, was imprisoned in a secure cell, and Varenukha, who had just been arrested in his apartment, to which he returned after an unknown absence for almost two days, appeared before the investigation.","And so, as has been said, the case dragged on this way until dawn on Saturday. Some new and very interesting facts then emerged. A six-seater passenger plane landed at Moscow airfield from the Crimea. One of the passengers who got off was rather strange. He was a young man, his face overgrown with stubble, who had not washed for three days, had inflamed and frightened eyes, no luggage, and was rather queerly dressed. He was wearing a Caucasian-style fur cap, a felt cloak over a nightshirt, and brand-new, just purchased, blue leather bedroom slippers. They approached him as he stepped off the gangway. They had been expecting him, and shortly after that, the unforgettable director of the Variety Theater, Stepan Bogdanovich Likhodeyev, appeared before the investigators. He added some new information. It now became clear that Woland had gotten into the Variety disguised as a performer, by hypnotizing Styopa Likhodeyev, and had then contrived to spirit the aforementioned Styopa out of Moscow, God knows how many kilometers away. This added to the mounting evidence, but things did not become any easier as a result, and, may in fact have become even more difficult, since it was becoming obvious that it was not going to be easy to capture someone capable of pulling that kind of stunt on Stepan Bogdanovich. In the meantime, Likhodeyev was locked up in a strong room at his own request, and appearing before the investigators was Varenukha, who had just been arrested at his apartment, where he had returned after an unaccountable absence of almost two days.","And so, as was said, the thing dragged on in this fashion until dawn on Saturday. Here new and very interesting data were added. A six-place passenger plane, coming from the Crimea, landed at the Moscow airport. Among the other passengers, one strange passenger got out of it. This was a young citizen, wildly overgrown with stubble, unwashed for three days, with inflamed and frightened eyes, carrying no luggage and dressed somewhat whimsically. The citizen was wearing a tall sheepskin hat, a Georgian felt cape over a nightshirt, and new, just-purchased, blue leather bedroom slippers. As soon as he separated from the ladder by which they descended from the plane, he was approached. This citizen had been expected, and in a little while the unforgettable director of the Variety, Stepan Bogdanovich Likhodeev, was standing before the investigators. He threw in some new data. It now became clear that Woland had penetrated the Variety in the guise of an artiste, having hypnotized Styopa Likhodeev, and had then contrived to fling this same Styopa out of Moscow and God knows how many miles away. The material was thus augmented, yet that did not make things easier, but perhaps even a bit harder, because it was becoming obvious that to lay hold of a person who could perform such stunts as the one of which Stepan Bogdanovich had been the victim would not be so easy. Incidentally, Likhodeev, at his own request, was confined in a secure cell, and next before the investigators stood Varenukha, just arrested in his own apartment, to which he had returned after a blank disappearance of almost two days."

"И вот, когда процессия прошла около полуверсты по дороге, Матвея, которого толкали в толпе у самой цепи, осенила простая и гениальная мысль, и тотчас же, по своей горячности, он осыпал себя проклятиями за то, что она не пришла ему раньше. Солдаты шли не тесною цепью. Между ними были промежутки.

If one were quick and timed it right, it might be possible to bend down, slip between two of the legionaries, get to the cart and jump up on it.

"Пес поднялся на задние лапы, а передние опустил на плечи своему хозяину, так что едва не повалил на пол, и лизнул его в щеку. Прокуратор сел в кресло, Банга, высунув язык и часто дыша, улегся у ног хозяина, причем радость в глазах пса означала, что кончилась гроза, единственное в мире, чего боялся бесстрашный пес, а также то, что он опять тут, рядом с тем человеком, которого любил, уважал и считал самым могучим в мире, повелителем всех людей, благодаря которому и самого себя пес считал существом привилегированным, высшим и особенным. Но, улегшись у ног и даже не глядя на своего хозяина, а глядя в вечереющий сад, пес сразу понял, что хозяина его постигла беда. Поэтому он переменил позу, поднялся, зашел сбоку и передние лапы и голову положил на колени прокуратору, вымазав полы плаща мокрым песком. Вероятно, действия Банги должны были означать, что он утешает своего хозяина и несчастье готов встретить вместе с ним.

But, lying down at his feet and not even looking at his master, but looking into the evening garden, the dog immediately realized that trouble had befallen his master. Therefore, he changed his position, got up, went sideways and put his front paws and head on the knees of the procurator, smearing the flaps of his cloak with wet sand. Probably, Bunga's actions were supposed to mean that he consoles his master and is ready to face misfortune with him. He tried to express this both in the eyes that were slanting towards the owner, and in the alert, pricked ears.

But once he had lain down by his master’s feet, the dog sensed immediately, even without looking at him, but at the gathering shadows in the garden, that something bad had happened to him. Therefore, the dog changed position, got up, went around to the side of the chair, and put his front paws and head on the procurator’s knees, getting wet sand all over the bottom of his cloak. Banga’s actions were probably meant to console his master and to let him know that he was prepared to face misfortune with him.

"Набожная, а откровеннее сказать – суеверная, Анфиса так напрямик и заявила очень расстроенной Анне Францевне, что это колдовство и что она прекрасно знает, кто утащил и жильца и милиционера, только к ночи не хочет говорить. Ну, а колдовству, как известно, стоит только начаться, а там уж его ничем не остановишь.

Well, as everyone knows, once witchcraft gets started, there’s no stopping it.

"– Самое несложное из всего! – ответил он. – Тем, кто хорошо знаком с пятым измерением, ничего не стоит раздвинуть помещение до желательных пределов. Скажу вам более, уважаемая госпожа, до черт знает каких пределов! Я, впрочем, – продолжал болтать Коровьев, – знавал людей, не имевших никакого представления не только о пятом измерении, но и вообще ни о чем не имевших никакого представления и тем не менее проделывавших чудеса в смысле расширения своего помещения. Так, например, один горожанин, как мне рассказывали, получив трехкомнатную квартиру на Земляном валу, без всякого пятого измерения и прочих вещей, от которых ум заходит за разум, мгновенно превратил ее в четырехкомнатную, разделив одну из комнат пополам перегородкой. Засим эту он обменял на две отдельных квартиры в разных районах Москвы – одну в три и другую в две комнаты. Согласитесь, что их стало пять. Трехкомнатную он обменял на две отдельных по две комнаты и стал обладателем, как вы сами видите, шести комнат, правда, рассеянных в полном беспорядке по всей Москве. Он уже собирался произвести последний и самый блистательный вольт, поместив в газете объявление, что меняет шесть комнат в разных районах Москвы на одну пятикомнатную квартиру на Земляном валу, как его деятельность, по не зависящим от него причинам, прекратилась. Возможно, что он сейчас и имеет какую-нибудь комнату, но только, смею вас уверить, что не в Москве. Вот-с, каков проныра, а вы изволите толковать про пятое измерение.","- The easiest of all! he replied. – For those who are well acquainted with the fifth dimension, it costs nothing to push the room to the desired limits. I will tell you more, dear lady, to the devil knows what limits! I, however, - Koroviev continued to chatter, - knew people who had no idea not only about the fifth dimension, but also had no idea about anything at all, and nevertheless performed miracles in the sense of expanding their premises. So, for example, one city dweller, as I was told, having received a three-room apartment on Zemlyanoy Val, without any fifth dimension and other things from which the mind goes beyond the mind, instantly turned it into a four-room apartment, dividing one of the rooms in half by a partition. He exchanged this one for two separate apartments in different districts of Moscow - one with three and the other with two rooms. Agree that there are five of them. He exchanged a three-room apartment for two separate two rooms each and became the owner, as you can see for yourself, of six rooms, though scattered in complete disarray throughout Moscow. He was about to make the last and most brilliant volt, placing an advertisement in the newspaper that he was changing six rooms in different districts of Moscow for one five-room apartment on Zemlyanoy Val, when his activities, for reasons beyond his control, ceased. It is possible that he now has some kind of room, but only, I dare to assure you, that he is not in Moscow. Here, sir, what a rogue, and you deign to talk about the fifth dimension.","“The simplest thing of all!” he replied. “Anyone familiar with the fifth dimension has no trouble whatsoever expanding his residence to whatever size he wishes. I might add, esteemed lady, to the devil knows what size! However,” Korovyov rattled on, “I have known people who haven’t the faintest conception of the fifth dimension, or of anything else for that matter, but who have still worked wonders when it came to expanding their residence. Take, for example, the city-dweller I heard about, who got a three-room apartment on Zemlyany Embankment and then turned it into four rooms in a flash without recourse to the fifth dimension or to anything else that goes beyond human reason, namely, by dividing one of the rooms in two with a partition. “He then proceeded to exchange his one apartment for two separate apartments in different sections of Moscow—one with three rooms, the other with two. That, you’ll agree, makes five rooms in all. Then he exchanged the three-room apartment for two separate two-room apartments, and thus, as you can see, became the possessor of six rooms, though, it’s true, they were scattered all over Moscow. He put an ad in the paper and announced his desire to exchange six rooms in various parts of Moscow for one five-room apartment on the Zemlyany Embankment and was thus on the verge of executing his last and most brilliant move, when something beyond his control put an end to his activities. It’s possible that he still has a room somewhere even now, but, I dare say, it’s not in Moscow. Now there’s an operator for you, and you were pleased to talk of the fifth dimension!”","‘The most uncomplicated thing of all!’ he replied. ‘For someone well acquainted with the fifth dimension, it costs nothing to expand space to the desired proportions. I’ll say more, respected lady — to devil knows what proportions! I, however,’ Koroviev went on chattering, ‘have known people who had no idea, not only of the fifth dimension, but generally of anything at all, and who nevertheless performed absolute wonders in expanding their space. Thus, for instance, one city-dweller, as I’ve been told, having obtained a three-room apartment on Zemlyanoy Val, transformed it instantly, without any fifth dimension or other things that addle the brain, into a four-room apartment by dividing one room in half with a partition. ‘He forthwith exchanged that one for two separate apartments in different parts of Moscow: one of three rooms, the other of two. You must agree that that makes five. The three-room one he exchanged for two separate ones, each of two rooms, and became the owner, as you can see for yourself, of six rooms — true, scattered in total disorder all over Moscow. He was just getting ready to perform his last and most brilliant leap, by advertising in the newspapers that he wanted to exchange six rooms in different parts of Moscow for one five-room apartment on Zemlyanoy Val, when his activity ceased for reasons independent of him. He probably also has some sort of room now, only I venture to assure you it is not in Moscow. A real slicker, you see, ma’am, and you keep talking about the fifth dimension!‘"

Покинув дорожку, он устремился в чащу масличных деревьев, пробираясь к югу. Он перелез через ограду сада вдалеке от главных ворот, в южном углу его, там, где вывалились верхние камни кладки. Вскоре он был на берегу Кедрона. Тогда он вошел в воду и пробирался некоторое время по воде, пока не увидел вдали силуэты двух лошадей и человека возле них. Лошади также стояли в потоке. Вода струилась, омывая их копыта. Коновод сел на одну из лошадей, человек в капюшоне вскочил на другую, и медленно они оба пошли в потоке, и слышно было, как хрустели камни под копытами лошадей. Потом всадники выехали из воды, выбрались на Ершалаимский берег и пошли шагом под стеною города.

He climbed over the garden fence far from the main gate, in the southern corner of it, where the top stones of the masonry fell out. Soon he was on the banks of Kidron. Then he entered the water and made his way through the water for some time, until he saw in the distance the silhouettes of two horses and a man near them. The horses also stood in the stream. The water flowed, washing their hooves. The groom mounted one of the horses, the hooded man jumped on the other, and slowly they both walked in the stream, and you could hear the stones crunching under the hooves of the horses. Then the riders rode out of the water, climbed out onto the Yershalaim shore and walked at a pace under the city wall. Then the horseman separated, galloped forward and disappeared from sight, and the man in the hood stopped the horse, got off it on a deserted road, took off his cloak, turned it inside out, took out a flat helmet without plumage from under the cloak, put it on. Now a man in a military mantle and with a short sword on his hip jumped on the horse. He touched the reins, and the hot cavalry horse trotted, shaking the rider. Now the path was not far. The rider rode up to the southern gate of Yershalaim.","The whole Gethsemane garden rang with the singing of nightingales. No one knows where Judas’s two assassins went, but the route taken by the third man in the hood is known. After leaving the road, he plunged into a grove of olive trees and headed south. He climbed over the garden wall far from the main gates, in its south corner, where the top layer of stones had fallen out. He soon reached the bank of the Kedron. Then he entered the stream and walked along in the water until he saw two horses silhouetted in the distance and a man standing next to them. The horses were also standing in the stream. The water washed over their hooves. The man tending the horses mounted one of them, and the man in the hood mounted the other. As the two of them headed slowly into the stream, one could hear the horses’ hooves scraping on the stones. After the riders came out of the stream, they went up the Yershalaim bank, and followed the city wall at a walking pace. Then the groom broke away and galloped ahead while the man in the hood stopped his horse, dismounted on the deserted road, took off his cloak, turned it inside out, removed a flat, uncrested helmet from its folds, and put it on. The man who now mounted the horse wore a military chlamys and a short sword on his hip. He touched the reins, and his spirited cavalry mount set off at a trot. The rider did not have far to go—he was approaching the southern gates of Yershalaim.","The whole garden of Gethsemane was just then pealing with the song of nightingales. Where the two who had stabbed Judas went, no one knows, but the route of the third man in the hood is known. Leaving the road, he headed into the thick of the olive trees, making his way south. He climbed over the garden fence far from the main gate, in the southern corner, where the upper stones of the masonry had fallen out. Soon he was on the bank of the Kedron. Then he entered the water and for some time made his way in it, until he saw ahead the silhouettes of two horses and a man beside them. The horses were also standing in the stream. The water flowed, washing their hoofs. The horse-handler mounted one of the horses, the man in the hood jumped on to the other, and the two slowly walked in the stream, and one could hear the pebbles crunching under the horses’ hoofs. Then the riders left the water, came out on the Yershalaim bank, and rode slowly under the city wall. Here the horse-handler separated himself, galloped ahead, and disappeared from view, while the man in the hood stopped his horse, dismounted on the deserted road, removed his cloak, turned it inside out, took from under the cloak a flat helmet without plumes and put it on. Now it was a man in a military chlamys with a short sword at his hip who jumped on to the horse. He touched the reins and the fiery cavalry horse set off at a trot, jolting its rider. It was not a long way — the rider was approaching the southern gate of Yershalaim."

"Волшебные черные кони и те утомились и несли своих всадников медленно, и неизбежная ночь стала их догонять.

"Первое, что поразило Маргариту, это та тьма, в которую они попали. Ничего не было видно, как в подземелье, и Маргарита невольно уцепилась за плащ Азазелло, опасаясь споткнуться. Но тут вдалеке и вверху замигал огонек какой-то лампадки и начал приближаться. Азазелло на ходу вынул из-под мышки Маргариты щетку, и та исчезла без всякого стука в темноте. Тут стали подниматься по каким-то широким ступеням, и Маргарите стало казаться, что им конца не будет. Ее поражало, как в передней обыкновенной московской квартиры может поместиться эта необыкновенная невидимая, но хорошо ощущаемая бесконечная лестница. Но тут подъем кончился, и Маргарита поняла, что стоит на площадке. Огонек приблизился вплотную, и Маргарита увидела освещенное лицо мужчины, длинного и черного, держащего в руке эту самую лампадку. Те, кто имел уже несчастие в эти дни попасться на его дороге, даже при слабом свете язычка в лампадке, конечно, тотчас же узнали бы его. Это был Коровьев, он же Фагот.","The first thing that struck Margarita was the darkness into which they fell. Nothing was visible, as in a dungeon, and Margarita involuntarily clung to Azazello's cloak, fearing to stumble. But then, in the distance and above, the light of some kind of lamp flickered and began to approach. As they walked, Azazello took out a brush from under Margarita's arm, and it disappeared without a sound in the darkness. Here they began to climb some wide steps, and Margarita began to think that there would be no end to them. She was amazed how this extraordinary invisible, but well-felt endless staircase could fit in the front of an ordinary Moscow apartment. But then the ascent ended, and Margarita realized that she was standing on the platform. The light came close, and Margarita saw the illuminated face of a man, long and black, holding this very lamp in his hand. Those who already had the misfortune these days to get caught in his way, even in the faint light of a tongue in a lamp, of course, would immediately recognize him. It was Koroviev, aka Fagot.","The first thing that struck Margarita was the total darkness in which she found herself.

As they were walking, Azazello took Margarita’s broom from under her arm, and it disappeared in the darkness without making a sound. They then began ascending broad steps which Margarita started to think would go on forever. It amazed her that the front hall of an ordinary Moscow apartment could contain such an extraordinary, and invisible, but very palpable, endless staircase. But their ascent did come to an end, and Margarita realized that she was on a landing. The light moved up close, and Margarita could see the illuminated face of the tall, black man who was holding the lamp in his hand. Anyone who had had the misfortune of crossing his path in recent days would have recognized him at once, even in that feebly flickering light.

"Маргарита налила Азазелло коньяку, и он охотно выпил его. Мастер, не спуская с него глаз, изредка под столом тихонько щипал себе кисть левой руки. Но щипки эти не помогали. Азазелло не растворялся в воздухе, да, сказать по правде, в этом не было никакой необходимости. Ничего страшного в рыжеватом маленького роста человеке не было, разве только вот глаз с бельмом, но ведь это бывает и без всякого колдовства, разве что одежда не совсем обыкновенная – какая-то ряса или плащ, – опять-таки, если строго вдуматься, и это попадается. Коньяк он тоже ловко пил, как и все добрые люди, целыми стопками и не закусывая. От этого самого коньяку у мастера зашумело в голове, и он стал думать:","Margarita poured cognac to Azazello, and he drank it willingly. The master, not taking his eyes off him, occasionally under the table quietly pinched his left hand. But these pinches did not help. Azazello did not dissolve into the air, yes, to tell the truth, there was no need for this. There was nothing terrible in a reddish short man, except for an eye with a thorn, but this happens without any witchcraft, except that the clothes are not quite ordinary - some kind of cassock or cloak - again, if you seriously think about it, and it comes across. He also deftly drank cognac, like all good people, in whole piles and without snacking. From this very cognac, the master rustled in his head, and he began to think:","Margarita poured Azazello some cognac, and he drank it gladly. Not taking his eyes off him, the Master would now and then quietly pinch his left wrist under the table. But the pinching did not help. Azazello did not evaporate into thin air, and, to tell the truth, there was no reason for him to do so. There was nothing terrifying about this short, red-haired man, except perhaps for his walleye, but such things can occur even without sorcery—or except perhaps for his not quite normal clothes—some kind of cassock or cloak—but then again, if one thinks about it seriously, there are people who dress like that. And he drank his cognac as all good men do, that is, downing each glass in one swallow, without eating anything. That same cognac made the Master’s head buzz, and he began thinking, “No, Margarita’s","Margarita poured Azazello some cognac, and he willingly drank it. The master, not taking his eyes off him, quietly pinched his own left hand under the table. But the pinches did not help.

There was nothing terrible in the short, reddish-haired man, unless it was his eye with albugo, but that occurs even without sorcery, or unless his clothes were not quite ordinary - some sort of cassock or cloak — but again, strictly considered, that also happens. He drank his cognac adroitly, too, as all good people do, by the glassful and without nibbling. From this same cognac the master’s head became giddy, and he began to think:"

"– Итак, – обратился к Маргарите Воланд, – рекомендую вам, донна, мою свиту. Этот валяющий дурака – кот Бегемот. С Азазелло и Коровьевым вы уже познакомились, служанку мою Геллу рекомендую.

"Да, дело тут вовсе не в колодах, фальшивых письмах в портфеле Никанора Ивановича. Это все пустяки. Это он, Коровьев, погнал под трамвай Берлиоза на верную смерть. Это он свел с ума бедного поэта Ивана Бездомного, он заставлял его грезить и видеть в мучительных снах древний Ершалаим и сожженную солнцем безводную Лысую Гору с тремя повешенными на столбах. Это он и его шайка заставили исчезнуть из Москвы Маргариту Николаевну и ее домработницу Наташу. Кстати: этим делом следствие занималось особенно внимательно. Требовалось выяснить, были ли похищены эти женщины шайкой убийц и поджигателей или же бежали вместе с преступной компанией добровольно? Основываясь на нелепых и путаных показаниях Николая Ивановича и приняв во внимание странную и безумную записку Маргариты Николаевны, оставленную мужу, записку, в которой она пишет, что уходит в ведьмы, учтя то обстоятельство, что Наташа исчезла, оставив все свои носильные вещи на месте, – следствие пришло к заключению, что и хозяйка и ее домработница были загипнотизированы, подобно многим другим, и в таком виде похищены бандой. Возникла и, вероятно, совершенно правильная мысль, что преступников привлекла красота обеих женщин.","Yes, it's not at all about the decks, the fake letters in Nikanor Ivanovich's briefcase.

It was necessary to find out whether these women were kidnapped by a gang of murderers and arsonists, or whether they fled with a criminal company voluntarily? Based on the absurd and confused testimony of Nikolai Ivanovich and taking into account Margarita Nikolaevna’s strange and crazy note left to her husband, a note in which she writes that she is going into witches, taking into account the fact that Natasha disappeared, leaving all her clothes in place, - the investigation concluded that both the hostess and her housekeeper were hypnotized, like many others, and in this form were kidnapped by the gang.

They had to determine whether the women had been abducted by the gang of murderers and arsonists or whether they had run off with the criminal band of their own free will. Based on the absurd and muddled testimony of Nikolai Ivanovich and taking into account the bizarre and insane note Margarita Nikolayevna had left her husband, in which she said she had gone off to be a witch, and considering the fact that Natasha had disappeared without taking any of her things, the investigators concluded that mistress and maid had both been hypnotized, along with so many others, and abducted by the gang while in that state. The quite likely possibility also arose that the criminals had been attracted by the women’s beauty.","Yes, the point here lay not at all in packs of cards, or the false letters in Nikanor Ivanovich’s briefcase!

"Более всего на свете прокуратор ненавидел запах розового масла, и все теперь предвещало нехороший день, так как запах этот начал преследовать прокуратора с рассвета.

"Маргарита летела беззвучно, очень медленно и невысоко, примерно на уровне второго этажа. Но и при медленном лете, у самого выхода на ослепительно освещенный Арбат, она немного промахнулась и плечом ударилась о какой-то освещенный диск, на котором была нарисована стрела. Это рассердило Маргариту. Она осадила послушную щетку, отлетела в сторону, а потом, бросившись на диск внезапно, концом щетки разбила его вдребезги. Посыпались с грохотом осколки, прохожие шарахнулись, где-то засвистели, а Маргарита, совершив этот ненужный поступок, расхохоталась. «На Арбате надо быть еще поосторожнее, – подумала Маргарита, – тут столько напутано всего, что и не разберешься». Она принялась нырять между проводами. Под Маргаритой плыли крыши троллейбусов, автобусов и легковых машин, а по тротуарам, как казалось сверху Маргарите, плыли реки кепок. От этих рек отделялись ручейки и вливались в огненные пасти ночных магазинов. «Э, какое месиво! – сердито подумала Маргарита, – тут повернуться нельзя». Она пересекла Арбат, поднялась повыше, к четвертым этажам, и мимо ослепительно сияющих трубок на угловом здании театра проплыла в узкий переулок с высокими домами. Все окна были открыты, и всюду слышалась в окнах радиомузыка. Из любопытства Маргарита заглянула в одно из них. Увидела кухню. Два примуса ревели на плите, возле них стояли две женщины с ложками в руках и переругивались.","Margarita flew silently, very slowly and low, approximately at the level of the second floor. But even with a slow summer, at the very exit to the dazzlingly illuminated Arbat, she missed a little and hit with her shoulder on some illuminated disk on which an arrow was drawn. This annoyed Marguerite. She laid siege to the obedient brush, flew off to the side, and then, rushing at the disk suddenly, smashed it to smithereens with the end of the brush. Splinters rained down with a roar, passers-by shied away, whistled somewhere, and Margarita, having committed this unnecessary act, burst out laughing. “You have to be even more careful on the Arbat,” Margarita thought, “there is so much confusion here that you can’t figure it out.” She began to dive between the wires. Roofs of trolleybuses, buses and cars floated under Margarita, and along the sidewalks, as it seemed to Margarita from above, rivers of caps floated. Streams split from these rivers and poured into the fiery mouths of night shops. “Oh, what a mess! Margarita thought angrily, “you can’t turn around here.” She crossed the Arbat, climbed higher, to the fourth floors, and sailed past the dazzlingly shining pipes on the corner building of the theater into a narrow alley with tall houses. All the windows were open, and radio music was heard everywhere in the windows. Out of curiosity, Margarita looked into one of them. I saw the kitchen. Two primus stoves roared on the stove, two women stood next to them with spoons in their hands and quarreled.","Margarita flew along noiselessly, at very slow speed and not too high up, at about second-storey level. But even at slow speed, just as she was about to come out onto the blindingly lit Arbat, she made a slight miscalculation and hit her shoulder against an illuminated circular sign with an arrow painted on it. This made her angry. She reined in her obedient broom, flew over to the side, and then made a sudden charge at the sign, smashing it to smithereens with the end of her broom handle. Splinters crashed, pedestrians jumped out of the way, a whistle blew, and Margarita, the perpetrator of this gratuitous prank, burst out into gales of laughter. “I should be more careful on the Arbat,” she thought. “Everything is so mixed up here that you get confused.” She began diving between the various wires. The tops of cars, trolleybuses, and buses floated by beneath her, and rivers of hats flowed along the sidewalks, or so it seemed from up high. Streams branched off these rivers and flowed into the fiery maws of the stores open at night. “What a mess this is!” thought Margarita in exasperation. “It’s impossible to make a turn.” She crossed the Arbat, flew higher, up to fourth-storey level, floated past the blinding lights of the theater marquee on the corner and into a narrow street with tall buildings. All their windows were wide open, and every where music could be heard playing on the radios. Out of curiosity Margarita peered into one of the windows. She saw a kitchen. Two primus stoves were roaring on top of the counter, and two women were standing next to it with spoons in their hands, squabbling.","Margarita flew noiselessly, very slowly, and not high up, approximately on second-floor level. But even with this slow flying, just at the entrance to the dazzlingly lit Arbat she misjudged slightly and struck her shoulder against some illuminated disc with an arrow on it. This angered Margarita. She reined in the obedient broom, flew a little aside, and then, suddenly hurling herself at the disc with the butt of the broom, smashed it to smithereens. Bits of glass rained down with a crash, passers-by shied away, a whistle came from somewhere, and Margarita, having accomplished this unnecessary act, burst out laughing. ‘On the Arbat I must be more careful,’ thought Margarita, ‘everything’s in such a snarl here, you can’t figure it out.’ She began dodging between the wires. Beneath Margarita floated the roofs of buses, trams and cars, and along the sidewalks, as it seemed to Margarita from above, floated rivers of caps. From these rivers little streams branched off and flowed into the flaming maws of night-time shops. ‘Eh, what a mess!’ Margarita thought angrily. ‘You can’t even turn around here.’ She crossed the Arbat, rose higher, to fourth-floor level, and, past the dazzlingly bright tubes on the theatre building at the comer, floated into a narrow lane with tall buildings. All the windows in them were open, and everywhere radio music came from the windows. Out of curiosity, Margarita peeked into one of them. She saw a kitchen. Two primuses were roaring on the range, and next to them stood two women with spoons in their hands, squabbling."

"Несмотря на данное Азазелло обещание больше не лгать, администратор начал именно со лжи. Хотя, впрочем, за это очень строго его судить нельзя.

Only after the administrator was told that his behavior, stupid and reckless, was interfering with the investigation of an important case and, of course, he would be responsible for this, Varenukha burst into tears and whispered in a trembling voice and looking around that he was lying solely out of fear, fearing the revenge of Volandovskaya gang, in the hands of which he has already been, and that he asks, prays, longs to be locked in an armored cell.","Despite the theater manager’s promise to Azazello never to lie again, he began with a lie.

"– Я неизлечим, – спокойно ответил гость, – когда Стравинский говорит, что вернет меня к жизни, я ему не верю. Он гуманен и просто хочет утешить меня. Не отрицаю, впрочем, что мне теперь гораздо лучше. Да, так на чем, бишь, я остановился? Мороз, эти летящие трамваи. Я знал, что эта клиника уже открылась, и через весь город пешком пошел в нее. Безумие! За городом я, наверно, замерз бы, но меня спасла случайность. Что-то сломалось в грузовике, я подошел к шоферу, это было километрах в четырех за заставой, и, к моему удивлению, он сжалился надо мной. Машина шла сюда. И он повез меня. Я отделался тем, что отморозил пальцы на левой ноге. Но это вылечили. И вот четвертый месяц я здесь. И, знаете ли, нахожу, что здесь очень и очень неплохо. Не надо задаваться большими планами, дорогой сосед, право! Я вот, например, хотел объехать весь земной шар. Ну, что же, оказывается, это не суждено. Я вижу только незначительный кусок этого шара. Думаю, что это не самое лучшее, что есть на нем, но, повторяю, это не так уж худо. Вот лето идет к нам, на балконе завьется плющ, как обещает Прасковья Федоровна. Ключи расширили мои возможности. По ночам будет луна. Ах, она ушла! Свежеет. Ночь валится за полночь. Мне пора.","“I am incurable,” the guest replied calmly, “when Stravinsky says that he will bring me back to life, I do not believe him. He is humane and just wants to comfort me.

I knew that this clinic had already opened, and through the whole city I went on foot to it. Madness! Outside the city, I probably would have frozen, but an accident saved me. Something broke in the truck, I approached the driver, it was four kilometers behind the outpost, and, to my surprise, he took pity on me. The car was coming here. And he took me. I escaped with frostbite toes on my left foot. But it has been cured. And this is my fourth month here. And, you know, I find that it is very, very good here. No need to make big plans, dear neighbor, right! For example, I wanted to travel around the globe. Well, it turns out that this is not meant to be. I see only a small part of this ball. I think that this is not the best thing on it, but, I repeat, it is not so bad. Now summer is coming to us, ivy will curl on the balcony, as Praskovya Fyodorovna promises. The keys have expanded my options. There will be moon at night. Ah, she's gone! Freshens up. The night falls past midnight. I have to go.","“I’m incurable,” the guest replied calmly. “When Stravinsky says that he’ll bring me back to life, I don’t believe him. He’s humane and simply wants to comfort me.

I would certainly have frozen to death when I got outside the city if a chance occurrence hadn’t saved me. A truck had broken down about four kilometers outside the city, and I went over to speak to the driver. To my surprise, he took pity on me. He was on his way here, and he gave me a lift.

And, you know, I don’t find it so bad here, not bad at all. One really shouldn’t make big plans for oneself, dear neighbor. Take me, for example, I wanted to travel around the globe. Well, it turned out that wasn’t meant to be. I can see only an insignificant little piece of it. I don’t think it’s the best piece of it either, but, as I said, it’s not so bad. Summer will be here soon, and the balcony will be covered with ivy, just as Praskovya Fyodorovna promises. Having her keys has given me new possibilities. There’ll be a moon at night. Ah, it’s gone! The air is fresher. It’s getting on past midnight. It’s time for me to go.”","‘I am incurable,’ the guest replied calmly. ‘When Stravinsky says he will bring me back to life, I don’t believe him.

I see only an insignificant piece of that globe. I suppose it’s not the very best there is on it, but, I repeat, it’s not so bad. Summer is coming, the ivy will twine up on to the balcony.

Если как следует провентилировать этот вопрос, выходит, что я, в сущности, даже и не знал как следует покойника. В самом деле, что мне о нем было известно?

"– Передай, что будет сделано, – ответил Воланд и прибавил, причем глаз его вспыхнул: – И покинь меня немедленно.","“Tell me what will be done,” Woland answered and added, his eye flashing: “And leave me immediately.”","“Tell him that it shall be done,” replied Woland, and added, his eye suddenly flashing, “and leave me this instant.”","‘Tell him it will be done,’ Woland replied and added, his eye flashing: ‘ And leave me immediately.’"
"– Приближенные утверждают, что это ревматизм, – говорил Воланд, не спуская глаз с Маргариты, – но я сильно подозреваю, что эта боль в колене оставлена мне на память одной очаровательной ведьмой, с которой я близко познакомился в тысяча пятьсот семьдесят первом году в Брокенских горах, на чертовой кафедре.","“People close to me say it’s rheumatism,” Woland said, not taking his eyes off Margarita, “but I strongly suspect that this pain in the knee was left to me as a keepsake by a charming witch, whom I became intimately acquainted with in 1571 in the Brokensky mountains, in the damn pulpit.","“My close friends insist that it’s rheumatism,” said Woland, keeping his eyes fixed on Margarita, “but I strongly suspect that the pain in my knee is a memento of my intimacy with a certain enchanting witch, whom I met in the Brocken Mountains, on the Devil’s Pulpit, in 1571.”","‘My attendants insist it’s rheumatism,’ Woland was saying, not taking his eyes off Margarita, ‘ but I strongly suspect that this pain in my knee was left me as a souvenir by a charming witch with whom I was closely acquainted in the year 1571, on Mount Brocken,5 on the Devil’s Podium.’"
"– Да, – продолжал Коровьев и озабоченно поднял палец, – но! Но, говорю я и повторяю это – но!

Ой-ой-ой, как бывает!","""Yes,"" continued Koroviev, raising a finger in concern, ""but! But, I say and repeat it - but! If these tender greenhouse plants are not attacked by some microorganism, they will not undermine them at the root, if they do not rot! And it happens with pineapples! Oh-oh-oh, how it happens!","“Yes,” continued Korovyov, and raised a cautionary finger, “ but! But—I say and I repeat it— but!

Oh, yes, indeed it can!”","‘Yes,’ Koroviev went on, anxiously raising his finger, ‘but! ... But, I say, and I repeat this but! ...

"«Это Николай Иванович, по шагам узнаю, – подумала Маргарита, – надо будет сделать на прощание что-то очень смешное и интересное».","“This is Nikolai Ivanovich, I recognize by the steps,” thought Margarita, “it will be necessary to do something very funny and interesting in parting.”","“That’s Nikolai Ivanovich, I can tell by his footsteps,” thought Margarita. “I’ll have to do something interesting and amusing as a way of saying good-bye.”","‘It’s Nikolai Ivanovich, I recognize his footsteps,‘ thought Margarita. ’ I must do something funny and interesting in farewell.‘"

"– Не по этому? – удивился иностранный маг. – А какое же еще дело могло привести вас ко мне? Если память не изменяет мне, из лиц, близких вам по профессии, я знался только с одной маркитанткой, но и то давно, когда вас еще не было на свете. Впрочем, я рад. Азазелло!

A stool for Mr. Buffet Manager!","the foreign magician asked in amazement. “What was it, then, that brought you here? If my memory doesn’t deceive me, I’ve known only one other person in your line of work, and that was a lady sutler, but that was long before you were even born. However, I’m glad you’ve come.

"Ведущий программу уставился прямо в глаза Канавкину, и Никанору Ивановичу даже показалось, что из этих глаз брызнули лучи, пронизывающие Канавкина насквозь, как бы рентгеновские лучи. В зале перестали дышать.","The host of the program stared directly into Kanavkin's eyes, and it even seemed to Nikanor Ivanovich that rays pierced Kanavkin through and through, as if X-rays, were splashing out of those eyes.

"И здесь ему показалось, что из-под двери кабинета потянуло вдруг гниловатой сыростью. Дрожь прошла по спине финдиректора. А тут еще ударили неожиданно часы и стали бить полночь. И даже бой вызвал дрожь в финдиректоре. Но окончательно его сердце упало, когда он услышал, что в замке двери тихонько поворачивается английский ключ. Вцепившись в портфель влажными, холодными руками, финдиректор чувствовал, что, если еще немного продлится этот шорох в скважине, он не выдержит и пронзительно закричит.","And here it seemed to him that from under the door of the office a stench of putrid dampness suddenly wafted.

"Ровное гудение машины, летящей высоко над землей, убаюкивало Маргариту, а лунный свет ее приятно согревал. Закрыв глаза, она отдала лицо ветру и думала с какой-то грустью о покинутом ею неизвестном береге реки, которую, как она чувствовала, она никогда более не увидит. После всех волшебств и чудес сегодняшнего вечера она уже догадывалась, к кому именно в гости ее везут, но это не пугало ее. Надежда на то, что там ей удастся добиться возвращения своего счастья, сделала ее бесстрашной. Впрочем, долго мечтать в машине об этом счастье ей не пришлось. Грач ли хорошо знал свое дело, машина ли была хороша, но только вскоре Маргарита, открыв глаза, увидела под собой не лесную тьму, а дрожащее озеро московских огней. Черная птица-шофер на лету отвинтил правое переднее колесо, а затем посадил машину на каком-то совершенно безлюдном кладбище в районе Драгомилова. Высадив ни о чем не спрашивающую Маргариту возле одного из надгробий вместе с ее щеткой, грач запустил машину, направив ее прямо в овраг за кладбищем. В него она с грохотом обрушилась и в нем погибла. Грач почтительно козырнул, сел на колесо верхом и улетел.","The steady hum of the machine, flying high above the ground, lulled Margarita, and the moonlight pleasantly warmed her. Closing her eyes, she gave her face to the wind and thought with a kind of sadness about the unknown bank of the river she had left, which she felt she would never see again. After all the magic and wonders of this evening, she already guessed to whom exactly they were taking her to visit, but this did not frighten her. The hope that there she would be able to achieve the return of her happiness made her fearless. However, she did not have to dream about this happiness for a long time in the car. Whether the rook knew his business well, whether the car was good, but only soon Margarita, opening her eyes, saw below her not the darkness of the forest, but a trembling lake of Moscow lights. The black bird driver unscrewed the right front wheel on the fly, and then landed the car in some completely deserted cemetery in the Dragomilov area. Having landed an unquestioning Margarita near one of the tombstones along with her brush, the rook started the car, directing it straight into the ravine behind the cemetery. She fell into it with a roar and died in it. The rook saluted respectfully, sat on the wheel and flew away.","THE steady hum of the car as it flew high above the earth soothed Margarita like a lullaby, and the moonlight warmed her pleasantly.

The hope that there she would succeed in regaining her happiness made her fearless. However, she had very little time in the car to dream of that happiness. Due either to the rook’s expertise, or the car’s superior quality, soon after Margarita opened her eyes, she saw below her the shimmering lake of Moscow’s lights rather than the darkness of the forest. The black bird-chauffeur unscrewed the right front wheel while they were still in flight, and then landed the vehicle in an utterly deserted cemetery in the Dorogomilov district. After depositing the unquestioning Margarita and her broom next to one of the gravestones, the rook sent the car rolling straight into the ravine behind the cemetery. It fell with a crash and was destroyed. The rook gave a respectful salute, mounted the wheel and flew off.","The steady humming of the car, flying high above the earth, lulled Margarita, and the moonlight warmed her pleasantly.

"Короткое пребывание Маргариты под вербами ознаменовалось одним эпизодом. В воздухе раздался свист, и черное тело, явно промахнувшись, обрушилось в воду. Через несколько мгновений перед Маргаритой предстал тот самый толстяк-бакенбардист, что так неудачно представился на том берегу. Он успел, по-видимому, смотаться на Енисей, ибо был во фрачном наряде, но мокр с головы до ног. Коньяк подвел его вторично: высаживаясь, он все-таки угодил в воду. Но улыбки своей он не утратил и в этом печальном случае, и был смеющеюся Маргаритой допущен к руке.","Margarita's short stay under the willows was marked by one episode. There was a whistle in the air, and the black body, obviously missing, fell into the water. A few moments later, Margarita was confronted by the same fat sideburner who introduced himself so unsuccessfully on the other side. He apparently managed to hit the Yenisei, for he was in a tailcoat, but wet from head to toe. Cognac let him down for the second time: landing, he nevertheless landed in the water. But he did not lose his smile even in this sad case, and was admitted to the hand of a laughing Margarita.","Maragarita’s brief sojourn under the willows was notable for one episode. A whistling sound cut through the air, and a black body, obviously way off target, crash-landed in the water. Seconds later Margarita found herself face-to-face with the same side-whiskered fat man who had introduced himself so infelicitously on the opposite shore. Evidently he had managed to dash back to the Yenisei, since he was now in full evening dress, albeit soaked from head to toe. Judging by his crash landing in the water, he had obviously had a second go at the brandy. But even this mishap had not wiped the smile off his face. And the amused Margarita, laughing, allowed him to kiss her hand.","Margarita’s short stay under the pussy willows was marked by one episode: there was a whistling in the air, and a black body, obviously missing its mark, dropped into the water.

"Не выдержали нервы, как говорится, и Римский не дождался окончания составления протокола и бежал в свой кабинет. Он сидел за столом и воспаленными глазами глядел на лежащие перед ним магические червонцы. Ум финдиректора заходил за разум. Снаружи несся ровный гул. Публика потоками выливалась из здания Варьете на улицу. До чрезвычайно обострившегося слуха финдиректора вдруг донеслась отчетливая милицейская трель. Сама по себе она уж никогда не сулит ничего приятного. А когда она повторилась и к ней на помощь вступила другая, более властная и продолжительная, а затем присоединился и явственно слышный гогот, и даже какое-то улюлюкание, финдиректор сразу понял, что на улице совершилось еще что-то скандальное и пакостное. И что это, как бы ни хотелось отмахнуться от него, находится в теснейшей связи с отвратительным сеансом, произведенным черным магом и его помощниками. Чуткий финдиректор нисколько не ошибся.","Nerves could not stand it, as they say, and Rimsky did not wait for the completion of the protocol and fled to his office. He sat at the table and looked with inflamed eyes at the magical gold coins lying in front of him. The financial director's mind went beyond reason. There was a steady hum outside. The audience poured in streams from the Variety building into the street. A distinct police trill suddenly reached the extremely heightened hearing of the financial director. By itself, it never promises anything pleasant. And when she repeated herself and another, more imperious and prolonged, came to her aid, and then a clearly audible cackle and even some kind of hooting joined in, the financial director immediately realized that something else scandalous and dirty had happened on the street. And that, no matter how much one would like to dismiss it, it is in the closest connection with the disgusting seance performed by the black magician and his assistants. The sensitive financial director was not at all mistaken.","HIS nerves couldn’t take it, as they say, and Rimsky ran off to his office without waiting for the police to finish their report of what had happened. He sat at his desk and stared with swollen eyes at the magic ten-ruble bills that lay before him. The financial director was at his wit’s end. A steady roar rose from the street as the public streamed out of the theater. The financial director’s overly sensitive ears suddenly heard the sharp trill of a police whistle, which is hardly ever a good omen. When that sound was repeated and then accompanied by another more imperious and prolonged one, only then to be joined by loud cackles of laughter and hoots, the financial director knew immediately that something scandalous and nasty had happened outside, and that, however much he wanted to brush it aside, it was intimately connected with the disgusting show put on by the black magician and his assistants. The quickwitted financial director was not mistaken.","His nerves gave out, as they say, and Rimsky fled to his office before they finished drawing up the report. He sat at his desk and stared with inflamed eyes at the magic banknotes lying before him. The findirector’s wits were addled. A steady hum came from outside. The audience poured in streams from the Variety building into the street. Rimsky’s extremely sharpened hearing suddenly caught the distant trill of a policeman. That in itself never bodes anything pleasant. But when it was repeated and, to assist it, another joined in, more authoritative and prolonged, and to them was added a clearly audible guffawing and even some hooting, the findirector understood at once that something else scandalous and vile had happened in the street. And that, however much he wanted to wave it away , it was closely connected with the repulsive seance presented by the black magician and his assistants. The keen-eared findirector was not mistaken in the least."

Сквозь цветные стекла больших окон (фантазия бесследно пропавшей ювелирши) лился необыкновенный, похожий на церковный, свет. В старинном громадном камине, несмотря на жаркий весенний день, пылали дрова. А жарко между тем нисколько не было в комнате, и даже наоборот, входящего охватывала какая-то погребная сырость.

And meanwhile it was not at all hot in the room, and on the contrary, a kind of cellar dampness enveloped the incoming person. In front of the fireplace, on a tiger skin sat, benevolently squinting at the fire, a black cat. There was a table, at the sight of which the God-fearing barman shuddered: the table was covered with church brocade. There were many bottles on the brocade tablecloth, full-bellied, moldy and dusty. A dish gleamed between the bottles, and it was immediately clear that this dish was made of pure gold. By the fireplace, a small, red-haired man, with a knife in his belt, roasted pieces of meat on a long steel sword, and the juice dripped into the fire, and smoke went up the chimney. There was a smell not only of roast, but also of some strong perfume and incense, from which the barman, who already knew from the newspapers about the death of Berlioz and about his place of residence, flashed the thought that they were already serving, what good, according to Berlioz, the church a funeral service, which thought, however, he immediately drove away from himself, as obviously absurd.","When he entered the room he had been invited into, the bartender was so struck by the furnishings that he forgot why he had come. Streaming through the large stained-glass windows (the whim of the jeweller’s wife who had vanished without a trace) was an extraordinary light, similar to the light in a church. Wood was burning in the huge old-fashioned fireplace despite the hot spring day. Yet it was not the least bit hot in the room; in fact, quite the opposite. A cellarlike dampness enveloped the man entering the room. Sitting on a tiger skin in front of the fireplace was a huge black cat, squinting contentedly at the fire. There was a table that made the God-fearing bartender shudder when he saw it: the table was covered with a brocaded altar cloth. On the altar cloth numerous bottles were arranged—potbellied, dusty, and moldy. Amidst the bottles a plate gleamed, and it was immediately obvious that the plate was made of pure gold. By the fireplace a short redheaded man with a knife in his belt was roasting pieces of meat skewered on a long steel sword, and the juice from the meat dripped in the fire, and the smoke went up the chimney. It smelled not only of roast meat, but of very strong perfume and incense, which made the bartender, who had learned of Berlioz’s death and his place of residence from the newspapers, wonder if they weren’t performing some kind of requiem mass for him. However, that notion was so preposterous that he dismissed it out of hand.","Going in where he was invited, the barman even forgot his business, so greatly was he struck by the decor of the room. Through the stained glass of the big windows (a fantasy of the jeweller’s utterly vanished wife) poured an unusual, church-like light. Logs were blazing in the huge antique fireplace, despite the hot spring day. And yet it was not the least bit hot in the room, and even quite the contrary, on entering one was enveloped in some sort of dankness as in a cellar. On a tiger skin in front of the fireplace sat a huge black tom-cat, squinting good-naturedly at the fire. There was a table at the sight of which the God-fearing barman gave a start: the table was covered with church brocade. On the brocade tablecloth stood a host of bottles - round-bellied, mouldy and dusty. Among the bottles gleamed a dish, and it was obvious at once that it was of pure gold. At the fireplace a small red-haired fellow with a knife in his belt was roasting pieces of meat on a long steel sword, and the juice dripped into the fire, and the smoke went up the flue. There was a smell not only of roasting meat, but also of some very strong perfume and incense, and it flashed in the barman’s mind, for he already knew of Berlioz’s death and his place of residence from the newspapers, that this might, for all he knew, be a church panikhida4 that was being served for Berlioz, which thought, however, he drove away at once as a priori absurd."

"– Виноват, – мягко отозвался неизвестный, – для того, чтобы управлять, нужно, как-никак, иметь точный план на некоторый, хоть сколько-нибудь приличный срок. Позвольте же вас спросить, как же может управлять человек, если он не только лишен возможности составить какой-нибудь план хотя бы на смехотворно короткий срок, ну, лет, скажем, в тысячу, но не может ручаться даже за свой собственный завтрашний день? И, в самом деле, – тут неизвестный повернулся к Берлиозу, – вообразите, что вы, например, начнете управлять, распоряжаться и другими и собою, вообще, так сказать, входить во вкус, и вдруг у вас... кхе... кхе... саркома легкого... – тут иностранец сладко усмехнулся, как будто мысль о саркоме легкого доставила ему удовольствие, – да, саркома, – жмурясь, как кот, повторил он звучное слово, – и вот ваше управление закончилось! Ничья судьба, кроме своей собственной, вас более не интересует. Родные вам начинают лгать, вы, чуя неладное, бросаетесь к ученым врачам, затем к шарлатанам, а бывает, и к гадалкам. Как первое и второе, так и третье – совершенно бессмысленно, вы сами понимаете. И все это кончается трагически: тот, кто еще недавно полагал, что он чем-то управляет, оказывается вдруг лежащим неподвижно в деревянном ящике, и окружающие, понимая, что толку от лежащего нет более никакого, сжигают его в печи. А бывает и еще хуже: только что человек соберется съездить в Кисловодск, – тут иностранец прищурился на Берлиоза, – пустяковое, казалось бы, дело, но и этого совершить не может, потому что неизвестно почему вдруг возьмет – поскользнется и попадет под трамвай! Неужели вы скажете, что это он сам собою управил так? Не правильнее ли думать, что управился с ним кто-то совсем другой? – и здесь незнакомец рассмеялся странным смешком.","- I'm sorry, - the unknown responded softly, - in order to manage, you need, after all, to have an exact plan for some, at least somewhat decent time. Let me ask you, how can a person manage if he is not only deprived of the opportunity to draw up any plan even for a ridiculously short period, well, let's say a thousand years, but he cannot even vouch for his own tomorrow? And, in fact,” here the stranger turned to Berlioz, “imagine that, for example, you begin to manage, dispose of both others and yourself, in general, so to speak, get a taste, and suddenly you have ... khe ... khe... lung sarcoma... - here the foreigner smiled sweetly, as if the thought of lung sarcoma gave him pleasure, - yes, sarcoma, - he repeated the sonorous word, screwing up his eyes like a cat, - and now your control is over! Nobody's fate but your own interests you no more. Relatives begin to lie to you, you, sensing something was wrong, rush to learned doctors, then to charlatans, and sometimes even to fortune-tellers. Both the first and second, and the third are completely meaningless, you yourself understand. And all this ends tragically: the one who until recently believed that he was in control of something suddenly finds himself lying motionless in a wooden box, and those around him, realizing that there is no longer any sense from the lying person, burn him in the furnace. And it happens even worse: as soon as a person is about to go to Kislovodsk, - here the foreigner squinted at Berlioz, - a trifling matter, it would seem, but he cannot do this either, because it is not known why he suddenly takes it - he slips and falls under a tram! Can you really say that it was he who controlled himself in this way? Wouldn't it be more correct to think that someone else did it? - and here the stranger laughed a strange laugh.","“I’m sorry,” replied the stranger in a soft voice, “but in order to be in control, you have to have a definite plan for at least a reasonable period of time. So how, may I ask, can man be in control if he can’t even draw up a plan for a ridiculously short period of time, say, a thousand years, and is, moreover, unable to ensure his own safety for even the next day? And, indeed,” here the stranger turned to Berlioz, “suppose you were to start controlling others and yourself, and just as you developed a taste for it, so the speak, you suddenly went and … well … got lung cancer …”—at which point the foreigner chuckled merrily, as if the thought of lung cancer brought him pleasure. “Yes, cancer,” he repeated, narrowing his eyes like a cat as he savored the sonorous word, “and there goes your control! No one’s fate is of any interest to you except your own. Your relatives start lying to you. You, sensing that something is wrong, run to learned physicians, then to quacks, and maybe even to fortune-tellers in the end. And going to any of them is pointless, as you well know. And it all ends tragically: that same fellow who not so long ago supposed that he was in control of something ends up lying stiff in a wooden box, and those present, realizing that he is no longer good for anything, cremate him in an oven. Why, even worse things can happen: a fellow will have just decided to make a trip to Kislovodsk,”—here the foreigner narrowed his eyes at Berlioz—“a trivial matter, it would seem, but he can’t even accomplish that because for some unknown reason he goes and slips and falls under a streetcar! Would you really say that that’s an example of his control over himself? Wouldn’t it be more correct to say that someone other than himself is in control?”—and at this point the stranger laughed a strange sort of laugh.","‘Pardon me,’ the stranger responded gently, ‘but in order to govern, one needs, after all, to have a precise plan for a certain, at least somewhat decent, length of time. Allow me to ask you, then, how can man govern, if he is not only deprived of the opportunity of making a plan for at least some ridiculously short period — well, say, a thousand years - but cannot even vouch for his own tomorrow? ‘And in fact,’ here the stranger turned to Berlioz, ‘imagine that you, for instance, start governing, giving orders to others and yourself, generally, so to speak, acquire a taste for it, and suddenly you get ... hem ... hem ... lung cancer ...’ — here the foreigner smiled sweetly, as if the thought of lung cancer gave him pleasure — ‘yes, cancer’ — narrowing his eyes like a cat, he repeated the sonorous word — ’and so your governing is over! ‘You are no longer interested in anyone’s fate but your own. Your family starts lying to you. Feeling that something is wrong, you rush to learned doctors, then to quacks, and sometimes to fortune-tellers as well. Like the first, so the second and third are completely senseless, as you understand. And it all ends tragically: a man who still recently thought he was governing something, suddenly winds up lying motionless in a wooden box, and the people around him, seeing that the man lying there is no longer good for anything, burn him in an oven. ‘And sometimes it’s worse still: the man has just decided to go to Kislovodsk’ — here the foreigner squinted at Berlioz - ’a trifling matter, it seems, but even this he cannot accomplish, because suddenly, no one knows why, he slips and falls under a tram-car! Are you going to say it was he who governed himself that way? Would it not be more correct to think that he was governed by someone else entirely?‘ And here the unknown man burst into a strange little laugh."

И уж по глазам Китайцева можно было видеть и смело сказать, что он чист, как хрусталь.","Decisively, he did not register anywhere upon arrival, did not show his passport or any other papers, contracts and agreements to anyone, and no one heard anything about him! Kitatsev, head of the program department of the entertainment commission, swore and swore that the missing Styopa Likhodeev had not sent him any program for the presentation of any Woland for approval and had not telephoned Kitatsev anything about the arrival of such Woland. So he, Kitaitsev, is completely incomprehensible and does not know how Styopa could allow such a session in the Variety Show. When they said that Arkady Apollonovich had seen this magician at a session with his own eyes, Kitaitsev only shrugged and raised his eyes to the sky. And one could see in Kitaytsev's eyes and boldly say that he was as pure as crystal.","He had certainly never registered anywhere upon his arrival, or showed anyone his passport, or any other documents, contracts, or agreements, and no one had heard anything about him! Kitaitsev, the head of the program department of the Entertainment Commission, swore by everything holy that the missing Styopa Likhodeyev had never sent him the program of any Woland for approval, nor had he ever called to inform Kitaitsev of the arrival of any such person. Thus he, Kitaitsev, did not know and could not understand how Styopa could have allowed such a performance to take place at the Variety. When he was told that Arkady Apollonovich had seen the magician in performance with his own eyes, Kitaitsev merely spread his hands and raised his eyes to heaven.

"Маргарита сделала еще один рывок, и тогда все скопище крыш провалилось под землю, а вместо него появилось внизу озеро дрожащих электрических огней, и это озеро внезапно поднялось вертикально, а затем появилось над головой у Маргариты, а под ногами блеснула луна. Поняв, что она перевернулась, Маргарита приняла нормальное положение и, обернувшись, увидела, что и озера уже нет, а что там, сзади за нею, осталось только розовое зарево на горизонте. И оно исчезло через секунду, и Маргарита увидела, что она наедине с летящей над нею слева луною. Волосы Маргариты давно уже стояли копной, а лунный свет со свистом омывал ее тело.

And it disappeared in a second, and Margarita saw that she was alone with the moon flying above her from the left. Margarita's hair had long stood in a mop, and the moonlight whistling washed over her body.

A second later and it too had vanished, and Margarita saw that she was alone with the moon, which was flying above her to her left.

"Итак, водка и закуска стали понятны, и все же на Степу было жалко взглянуть: он решительно не помнил ничего о контракте и, хоть убейте, не видел вчера этого Воланда.

"Маргарита повесила трубку, и тут в соседней комнате что-то деревянно заковыляло и стало биться в дверь. Маргарита распахнула ее, и половая щетка, щетиной вверх, танцуя, влетела в спальню.

Тут только у наездницы мелькнула мысль о том, что она в этой суматохе забыла одеться. Она галопом подскочила к кровати и схватила первое попавшееся, какую-то голубую сорочку.

"– Обе вы хороши, – звучно сказала Маргарита, переваливаясь через подоконник в кухню. Обе ссорящиеся повернулись на голос и замерли с грязными ложками в руках.

"Лишь только Коровьев и Азазелло скрылись, мигание Бегемота приняло усиленные размеры. Белый король наконец догадался, чего от него хотят, вдруг стащил с себя мантию, бросил ее на клетку и убежал с доски. Офицер брошенное королевское одеяние накинул на себя и занял место короля. Коровьев и Азазелло вернулись.","As soon as Koroviev and Azazello disappeared, Behemoth's blinking took on intensified dimensions.

"Да, Михаил Александрович никуда не мог позвонить, и совершенно напрасно возмущались и кричали Денискин, Глухарев и Квант с Бескудниковым. Ровно в полночь все двенадцать литераторов покинули верхний этаж и спустились в ресторан.

"– Ну вот, – ухитрялся шептать Коровьев Маргарите и в то же время кричать кому-то: – Герцог, бокал шампанского! Я восхищен! Да, так вот-с, госпожа Тофана входила в положение этих бедных женщин и продавала им какую-то воду в пузырьках. Жена вливала эту воду в суп супругу, тот его съедал, благодарил за ласку и чувствовал себя превосходно. Правда, через несколько часов ему начинало очень сильно хотеться пить, затем он ложился в постель, и через день прекрасная неаполитанка, накормившая своего мужа супом, была свободна, как весенний ветер.","- Well, - Koroviev managed to whisper to Margarita and at the same time shout to someone: - Duke, a glass of champagne! I am impressed! Yes, so, sir, Mrs. Tofana entered into the situation of these poor women and sold them some kind of bottled water. The wife poured this water into the soup for her husband, who ate it, thanked for the kindness and felt great. True, after a few hours he began to feel very thirsty, then he went to bed, and a day later the beautiful Neapolitan woman, who fed her husband with soup, was free as a spring wind.","“And so,” said Korovyov, managing to whisper in Margarita ’s ear while also shouting to someone, “Duke! A glass of champagne! Delighted to see you! … And so, as I was saying, Signora Tofana sympathized with these poor women’s predicament, and sold them vials of some kind of potion. The wife would pour it into her husband’s soup, the husband would eat it, thank her for her tender attention, and feel marvelous. True, a few hours later the husband would develop a terrible thirst, then take to his bed, and the day after that the beautiful Neapolitan lady, who had fed her husband the soup, would be as free as the spring breeze.”","‘And so,’ Koroviev managed to whisper to Margarita and at the same time to cry out to someone: ‘Duke!

"С совершенно облегченной душой Маргарита прилетела в спальню, и следом за нею туда же вбежала Наташа, нагруженная вещами.

"В предложении переводчика заключался ясный практический смысл, предложение было очень солидное, но что-то удивительно несолидное было и в манере переводчика говорить, и в его одежде, и в этом омерзительном, никуда не годном пенсне. Вследствие этого что-то неясное томило душу председателя, и все-таки он решил принять предложение. Дело в том, что в жилтовариществе был, увы, преизрядный дефицит. К осени надо было закупать нефть для парового отопления, а на какие шиши – неизвестно. А с интуристовыми деньгами, пожалуй, можно было и вывернуться. Но деловой и осторожный Никанор Иванович заявил, что ему прежде всего придется увязать этот вопрос с интуристским бюро.","The interpreter's proposal had a clear practical meaning, the proposal was very solid, but there was something surprisingly undignified in the interpreter's manner of speaking, and in his clothes, and in this disgusting, worthless pince-nez.

By autumn it was necessary to buy oil for steam heating, but it is not known for what money. And with foreign tourist money, perhaps, it was possible to wriggle out. But the businesslike and cautious Nikanor Ivanovich declared that he would first of all have to link this issue with the Intourist Bureau.","The interpreter’s proposition made a lot of practical sense.

The fact of the matter was that the house committee had incurred, alas, an enormous deficit. They had to buy heating oil for the fall, and where the money would come from was a mystery. Maybe the foreign visitor’s money would get them out of the hole. Even so, the businesslike and cautious Nikanor Ivanovich said that he would first have to clear the matter with the Intourist Office.","The interpreter’s offer made clear practical sense, it was a very solid offer, yet there was something remarkably unsolid in his manner of speaking, and in his clothes, and in that loathsome, good-for-nothing pince-nez.

"Этого свиста Маргарита не услыхала, но она его увидела в то время, как ее вместе с горячим конем бросило саженей на десять в сторону. Рядом с нею с корнем вырвало дубовое дерево, и земля покрылась трещинами до самой реки. Огромный пласт берега, вместе с пристанью и рестораном, высадило в реку. Вода в ней вскипела, взметнулась, и на противоположный берег, зеленый и низменный, выплеснуло целый речной трамвай с совершенно невредимыми пассажирами. К ногам храпящего коня Маргариты швырнуло убитую свистом Фагота галку. Мастера вспугнул этот свист. Он ухватился за голову и побежал обратно к группе дожидавшихся его спутников.","Margarita did not hear this whistle, but she saw it at the time when she, together with the hot horse, was thrown ten fathoms to the side. Next to her, an oak tree was uprooted, and the ground was cracked all the way to the river. A huge layer of the coast, along with a pier and a restaurant, landed in the river. The water in it boiled, shot up, and on the opposite bank, green and low, splashed out a whole river tram with completely unharmed passengers. At the feet of Margarita's snoring horse, a jackdaw, killed by Fagot's whistle, was thrown. The master was startled by this whistle. He grabbed his head and ran back to the group of waiting companions.","Margarita did not hear the whistle, but she saw its effects when she and her fiery steed were thrown more than twenty yards to the side.

"– Охотно могу сообщить это, – отозвался Пилат, – ибо я был свидетелем этого. Добрые люди бросались на него, как собаки на медведя. Германцы вцепились ему в шею, в руки, в ноги.

"Горы превратили голос мастера в гром, и этот же гром их разрушил. Проклятые скалистые стены упали. Осталась только площадка с каменным креслом.

Получив от этого некоторое облегчение, он отходил и вновь начинал мерить взад и вперед пыльную дорогу, ведущую на вершину. Длинный меч его стучал по кожаному шнурованному сапогу.

Ведра пустели быстро, и кавалеристы из разных взводов по очереди отправлялись за водой в балку под горой, где в жидкой тени тощих тутовых деревьев доживал свои дни на этой дьявольской жаре мутноватый ручей.

And how curious: before my meeting with her, few people came to our yard — more simply, no one came — but now it seemed to me that the whole city came flocking there. ‘Bang goes the gate, bang goes my heart, and, imagine, it’s inevitably somebody’s dirty boots level with my face behind the window. A knife-grinder. Now, who needs a knife-grinder in our house? To sharpen what? What knives?"

"– Благодарю вас, мессир, – чуть слышно сказала Маргарита и вопросительно поглядела на Воланда. Тот в ответ улыбнулся ей вежливо и равнодушно. Черная тоска как-то сразу подкатила к сердцу Маргариты. Она почувствовала себя обманутой. Никакой награды за все ее услуги на балу никто, по-видимому, ей не собирался предлагать, как никто ее и не удерживал. А между тем ей совершенно ясно было, что идти ей отсюда больше некуда. Мимолетная мысль о том, что придется вернуться в особняк, вызвала в ней внутренний взрыв отчаяния. Попросить, что ли, самой, как искушающе советовал Азазелло в Александровском саду? «Нет, ни за что», – сказала она себе.","“Thank you, Messire,” Margarita said in a barely audible voice and looked inquiringly at Woland. He smiled at her politely and indifferently. Black melancholy somehow immediately rolled up to Margarita's heart. She felt cheated. No one, apparently, was going to offer her any reward for all her services at the ball, just as no one kept her. And yet it was perfectly clear to her that she had nowhere else to go from here. The fleeting thought that she would have to return to the mansion caused an internal explosion of despair in her. Ask, perhaps, most, as Azazello temptingly advised in the Alexander Garden? No, not at all, she told herself.","“Thank you, Messire,” said Margarita in barely audible tones, and she gave Woland a questioning look. He responded with a polite and noncommittal smile. Black anguish immediately threatened to engulf Margarita’s heart. She felt cheated. No one, it seemed, had any intention of rewarding her for her services at the ball, nor did they wish to stop her from leaving. And yet it was perfectly obvious to her that she no longer had any place to go. A fleeting thought that she might have to go back to her house sent a jolt of despair through her. Should she ask for something for herself, as Azazello had so temptingly suggested in the Alexandrovsky Park? “No, not for anything,” she said to herself.","‘I thank you, Messire,’ Margarita said barely audibly, and looked questioningly at Woland. In reply, he smiled at her courteously and indifferently. Black anguish somehow surged up all at once in Margarita’s heart. She felt herself deceived.

"Когда истек четвертый час казни, мучения Левия достигли наивысшей степени, и он впал в ярость. Поднявшись с камня, он швырнул на землю бесполезно, как он теперь думал, украденный нож, раздавил флягу ногою, лишив себя воды, сбросил с головы кефи, вцепился в свои жидкие волосы и стал проклинать себя.","When the fourth hour of the execution was over, Levi's torment reached its highest point, and he fell into a rage.

Николай Иванович не очень удивил следствие, выложив на стол шутовское удостоверение о том, что он провел время на балу у сатаны. В своих рассказах, как он возил по воздуху на себе голую домработницу Маргариты Николаевны куда-то ко всем чертям на реку купаться и о предшествующем этому появлении в окне обнаженной Маргариты Николаевны, Николай Иванович несколько отступил от истины. Так, например, он не счел нужным упомянуть о том, что он явился в спальню с выброшенной сорочкой в руках и что называл Наташу Венерой. По его словам выходило, что Наташа вылетела из окна, оседлала его и повлекла вон из Москвы...","Then a number of people went in a file, and among them was Nikolai Ivanovich, who had just been arrested solely due to the stupidity of his jealous wife, who let the police know in the morning that her husband was missing.

In his stories, how he carried the naked housekeeper Margarita Nikolaevna through the air on himself somewhere to hell on the river to swim and about the appearance of the naked Margarita Nikolaevna in the window preceding this, Nikolai Ivanovich deviated somewhat from the truth.

For example, he did not deem it necessary to mention his appearance in the bedroom, holding Margarita’s discarded chemise in his hands, nor did he say he had called Natasha Venus.

"– Он говорит, – раздался голос Воланда, – одно и то же, он говорит, что и при луне ему нет покоя и что у него плохая должность. Так говорит он всегда, когда не спит, а когда спит, то видит одно и то же – лунную дорогу, и хочет пойти по ней и разговаривать с арестантом Га-Ноцри, потому, что, как он утверждает, он чего-то не договорил тогда, давно, четырнадцатого числа весеннего месяца нисана. Но, увы, на эту дорогу ему выйти почему-то не удается, и к нему никто не приходит. Тогда, что же поделаешь, приходится разговаривать ему с самим собою. Впрочем, нужно же какое-нибудь разнообразие, и к своей речи о луне он нередко прибавляет, что более всего в мире ненавидит свое бессмертие и неслыханную славу.

But, alas, for some reason he fails to get out on this road, and no one comes to him. Then what can you do, he has to talk to himself.

But, alas, for some reason, he never does manage to walk on the path, and no one comes to see him. So there is nothing for him to do except talk to himself.

But, alas, for some reason he never manages to get on to this path, and no one comes to him. Then there’s no help for it , he must talk to himself.

Все это только снилось Никанору Ивановичу под влиянием поганца Коровьева. Единственный живой, влетевший в этот сон, именно и был Савва Потапович – артист, и ввязался он в это только потому, что врезался в память Никанору Ивановичу благодаря своим частым выступлениям по радио.

Nikanor Ivanovich had just dreamed it all under the influence of that rogue Korovyov. The only living person in the dream had been Savva Potapovich, the actor, and he had gotten into the dream just because he had been on the radio so much that he stuck in Nikanor Ivanovich’s memory. He did exist, but the others did not.","Well, and what on earth happened to them? Good heavens!

"Стараясь за что-нибудь ухватиться, Берлиоз упал навзничь, несильно ударившись затылком о булыжник, и успел увидеть в высоте, но справа или слева – он уже не сообразил, – позлащенную луну. Он успел повернуться на бок, бешеным движением в тот же миг подтянув ноги к животу, и, повернувшись, разглядел несущееся на него с неудержимой силой совершенно белое от ужаса лицо женщины-вагоновожатой и ее алую повязку. Берлиоз не вскрикнул, но вокруг него отчаянными женскими голосами завизжала вся улица. Вожатая рванула электрический тормоз, вагон сел носом в землю, после этого мгновенно подпрыгнул, и с грохотом и звоном из окон полетели стекла. Тут в мозгу Берлиоза кто-то отчаянно крикнул – «Неужели?..» Еще раз, и в последний раз, мелькнула луна, но уже разваливаясь на куски, и затем стало темно.","Trying to grab onto something, Berlioz fell on his back, slightly hitting the back of his head on a cobblestone, and managed to see in the height, but to the right or left - he no longer realized - the gilded moon. He managed to turn on his side, pulling his legs up to his stomach with a frantic movement at the same moment, and, turning, made out the face of the female carriage driver and her scarlet bandage, completely white with horror, rushing at him with irresistible force. Berlioz did not cry out, but around him the whole street shrieked with desperate female voices. The driver pulled the electric brake, the car sat down with its nose on the ground, after that it instantly jumped, and with a roar and a ringing, glass flew out of the windows. Then in Berlioz's brain someone desperately shouted - ""Really? .."" Once again, and for the last time, the moon flashed, but already breaking into pieces, and then it became dark.","Trying to grab hold of something, Berlioz fell flat on his back and hit the back of his neck lightly against the cobblestones.

When he turned, he saw the absolutely white, horror-stricken face and the crimson armband of the woman streetcar driver bearing down on him with irresistible force. Berlioz did not scream, but the whole street around him began squealing with women’s despairing voices. The driver pulled on the electric emergency brake, the car pitched forward, then jumped instantaneously, and the glass flew out of the windows, crashing and shattering.

"Маргарита поднялась на метр вверх и ударила по люстре. Две лампочки разорвало, и во все стороны полетели подвески. Крики в скважине прекратились, на лестнице послышался топот. Маргарита выплыла в окно, оказалась снаружи окна, размахнулась несильно и молотком ударила в стекло. Оно всхлипнуло, и по облицованной мрамором стене каскадом побежали вниз осколки. Маргарита поехала к следующему окну. Далеко внизу забегали люди по тротуару, из двух стоявших у подъезда машин одна загудела и отъехала. Покончив с окнами Латунского, Маргарита поплыла к соседней квартире. Удары стали чаще, переулок наполнился звоном и грохотом.

"Маргарита наклонила щетку щетиной вперед, так что хвост ее поднялся кверху, и, очень замедлив ход, пошла к самой земле. И это скольжение, как на воздушных салазках, вниз принесло ей наибольшее наслаждение.

Going ahead of it, Margarita passed over yet another watery mirror, in which a second moon floated under her feet, dropped down lower still and went on, her feet nearly touching the tops of the huge pines."
"Лампы погасли, некоторое время была тьма, и издалека в ней слышался нервный тенор, который пел:","The lamps went out, for some time there was darkness, and from afar a nervous tenor was heard in it, who sang:","The lights went out, it was dark for a while, and then a nervous tenor could be heard singing from afar, “","The lights went out, there was darkness for a while, and in it a nervous tenor was heard singing from far away:"

"– Я ничего не понимаю, – тихо заговорила Маргарита Николаевна, – про листки еще можно узнать... проникнуть, подсмотреть... Наташа подкуплена? да? Но как вы могли узнать мои мысли? – она страдальчески сморщилась и добавила: – Скажите мне, кто вы такой? Из какого вы учреждения?","“I don’t understand anything,” Margarita Nikolaevna spoke quietly, “you can still find out about the sheets ... penetrate, peep ... Natasha was bribed? Yes? But how could you know my thoughts? - she grimaced in pain and added: - Tell me, who are you? What institution are you from?","“I don’t understand any of this,” said Margarita Nikolayevna softly. “You could have found out about the burnt pages … broken into my house and spied on me … Did you pay off Natasha, is that it? But how could you know my thoughts?” She wrinkled her brow, looking agonized, and added, “Tell me, who are you? What department are you from?”","‘I don’t understand any of this,’ Margarita began quietly. ‘It’s possible to find out about the pages ... get in, snoop around ... You bribed Natasha, right? But how could you find out my thoughts?’ She scowled painfully and added: ‘Tell me, who are you? From which institution?’"
"Да, любовь поразила нас мгновенно. Я это знал в тот же день уже, через час, когда мы оказались, не замечая города, у кремлевской стены на набережной.","Yes, love struck us instantly. I knew this on the same day already, an hour later, when we found ourselves, without noticing the city, at the Kremlin wall on the embankment.","“Yes, love struck us instantly.

"Намучавшись с этими двумя Берлиозами, Иван все зачеркнул и решил начать сразу с чего-то очень сильного, чтобы немедленно привлечь внимание читающего, и написал, что кот садился в трамвай, а потом вернулся к эпизоду с отрезанной головой. Голова и предсказание консультанта привели его к мысли о Понтии Пилате, и для вящей убедительности Иван решил весь рассказ о прокураторе изложить полностью с того самого момента, как тот в белом плаще с кровавым подбоем вышел в колоннаду иродова дворца.","Having tormented himself with these two Berliozes, Ivan crossed everything out and decided to start immediately with something very strong in order to immediately attract the attention of the reader, and wrote that the cat was getting on the tram, and then returned to the episode with the severed head. The consultant's head and prediction led him to think about Pontius Pilate, and for greater persuasiveness, Ivan decided to tell the whole story about the procurator in full from the very moment he, in a white cloak with bloody lining, entered the colonnade of Herod's palace.","Tormented by these two Berliozes, Ivan crossed everything out and decided to begin with a strong opening that would immediately get the reader’s attention. He began with a description of the cat boarding the streetcar, and then went back to the episode of the severed head. The head and the consultant’s prediction made him think of Pontius Pilate, and in order to make the report more convincing, he decided to include the whole story about the procurator, starting with the moment when he came out onto the colonnade of Herod’s palace dressed in a white robe with a blood-red lining.","After suffering over these two Berliozes, Ivan crossed it all out and decided to begin right off with something very strong, in order to attract the reader’s attention at once, so he wrote that a cat had got on a tram-car, and then went back to the episode with the severed head. The head and the consultant’s prediction led him to the thought of Pontius Pilate, and for greater conviction Ivan decided to tell the whole story of the procurator in full, from the moment he walked out in his white cloak with blood-red lining to the colonnade of Herod’s palace."
"– Какой там кот? – в злобе закричала девица, – осел у нас в филиале сидит, осел! – и, прибавив к этому: – Пусть слышит! Я все расскажу, – действительно рассказала о том, что случилось.","- What's the cat? - the girl shouted in anger, - a donkey is sitting in our branch, a donkey! - and adding to this: - Let him hear! I'll tell you everything - I really told about what happened.","“What cat?” she screamed angrily. “It’s an ass we’ve got in this office, a real ass!” and then she added, “Let him hear! I’ll tell the whole story,” and she did, in fact, go on to relate what had happened.","‘What cat?’ the girl cried in anger. ‘ An ass, it’s an ass we’ve got sitting in the affiliate!’ And adding to that: ‘Let him hear, I’ll tell everything’ - she indeed told what had happened."
"Но длилась эта стрельба очень недолго и сама собою стала затихать. Дело в том, что ни коту, ни пришедшим она не причинила никакого вреда. Никто не оказался не только убит, но даже ранен; все, в том числе и кот, остались совершенно невредимыми. Кто-то из пришедших, чтобы это окончательно проверить, выпустил штук пять в голову окаянному животному, и кот бойко ответил целой обоймой. И то же самое – никакого впечатления ни на кого это не произвело. Кот покачивался в люстре, размахи которой все уменьшались, дуя зачем-то в дуло браунинга и плюя себе на лапу. У стоящих внизу в молчании на лицах появилось выражение полного недоумения. Это был единственный, или один из единственных, случай, когда стрельба оказалась совершенно недействительной. Можно было, конечно, допустить, что браунинг кота – какой-нибудь игрушечный, но о маузерах пришедших этого уж никак нельзя было сказать. Первая же рана кота, в чем уж, ясно, не было ни малейшего сомнения, была не чем иным, как фокусом и свинским притворством, равно как и питье бензина.","But this shooting did not last very long and began to subside by itself. The fact is that she did not cause any harm to either the cat or the visitors. No one was not only killed, but even wounded; everyone, including the cat, remained completely unharmed. Someone from those who came to check it out finally fired about five pieces into the head of the damned animal, and the cat briskly answered with a whole clip. And the same thing - it did not make any impression on anyone. The cat swayed in the chandelier, the scope of which was decreasing, blowing for some reason into the muzzle of the Browning and spitting on his paw. Those standing below in silence had an expression of complete bewilderment on their faces. This was the only, or one of the only, cases in which the shooting was completely invalid. It could, of course, be assumed that the browning of the cat was some kind of toy, but the same could not be said about the Mausers who came. The cat's first wound, of which there was not the slightest doubt, was nothing more than a trick and a swine pretense, as well as drinking gasoline.","But it lasted for only a short time and began to subside of its own accord. The fact was that the shots harmed neither the cat, nor the men who had come to catch him. Not only was no one killed, no one was even wounded; everyone, including the cat, remained completely unhurt To verify this once and for all, one of the men fired five rounds into the accursed head of the beast, whereupon the cat shot back a vigorous reply. And the same thing happened—no one felt the slightest effect. The cat swung back and forth on the chandelier in ever-diminishing arcs, blowing into the muzzle of his Browning for some reason, and spitting on his paw. An expression of complete befuddlement spread over the faces of the men standing in silence below. It was the only instance, or one of the only instances, when shooting had no effect whatsoever. It was possible, of course, to conclude that the cat’s Browning was a toy of some sort, but that would certainly not have applied to the Mausers. The cat’s first wound, and of that there could not be the slightest doubt, had been nothing other than a trick and a swinish bit of playacting, as was his drinking of the kerosene.","But this shooting did not last long and began to die down of itself. The thing was that it caused no harm either to the cat or to the visitors. Not only was no one killed, but no one was even wounded. Everyone, including the cat, remained totally unharmed. One of the visitors, to verify it definitively, sent some five bullets at the confounded animal’s head, while the cat smartly responded with a full clip, but it was the same — no effect was produced on anybody. The cat swayed on the chandelier, which swung less and less, blowing into the muzzle of his Browning and spitting on his paw for some reason. The faces of those standing silently below acquired an expression of utter bewilderment. This was the only case, or one of the only cases, when shooting proved to be entirely inefficacious. One might allow, of course, that the cat’s Browning was some sort of toy, but one could by no means say the same of the visitors’ Mausers. The cat’s very first wound — there obviously could not be the slightest doubt of it — was nothing but a trick and a swinish sham, as was the drinking of the benzene."
