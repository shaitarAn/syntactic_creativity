"Она обошла вокруг фортепьяно и стала прямо напротив Паншина. Он повторил романс, придавая мелодраматическое дрожание своему голосу.

"А Лаврецкий опять не спал всю ночь. Ему не было грустно, он не волновался, он затих весь; но он не мог спать. Он даже не вспоминал прошедшего времени; он просто глядел в свою жизнь; сердце его билось тяжело и ровно, часы летели, он и не думал о сне. По временам только всплывала у него в голове мысль: «Да это неправда, это все вздор», – и он останавливался, поникал головою и снова принимался глядеть в свою жизнь.","And Lavretsky again did not sleep all night. He was not sad, he was not worried, he was completely calm; but he couldn't sleep. He didn't even remember the past tense; he simply looked into his life; his heart was beating hard and evenly, the hours flew by, he did not even think about sleep. From time to time the thought would only pop up in his head: “Yes, it’s not true, it’s all nonsense,” and he would stop, bow his head, and again begin to look into his life.","But again Lavretsky did not sleep the whole night. He was neither sad, nor excited, he was quite calm; but he could not sleep. He did not even think about the past; he simply surveyed his life; his heart beat heavily and evenly, and the hours flew by without a thought of sleep. At times only there would float into his mind the thought: ‘It’s untrue, it’s all nonsense,’ and he would stop and lower his head and again begin the probing survey of his life.","Again Lavretsky did not sleep all night. He was not sad, he was not agitated, he was quite clam; but he could not sleep.

"Тоской любви, тоской немых стремлений Душа полна; Мне тяжело… Но ты чужда смятений, Как та луна.","The soul is full of longing for love, longing for mute aspirations; It's hard for me...

"Часа четыре спустя он ехал домой. Тарантас его быстро катился по проселочной мягкой дороге. Недели две как стояла засуха; тонкий туман разливался молоком в воздухе и застилал отдаленные леса; от него пахло гарью. Множество темноватых тучек с неясно обрисованными краями расползались по бледно-голубому небу; довольно крепкий ветер мчался сухой непрерывной струей, не разгоняя зноя. Приложившись головой к подушке и скрестив на груди руки, Лаврецкий глядел на пробегавшие веером загоны полей, на медленно мелькавшие ракиты, на глупых ворон и грачей, с тупой подозрительностью взиравших боком на проезжавший экипаж, на длинные межи, заросшие чернобыльником, полынью и полевой рябиной; он глядел… и эта свежая, степная, тучная голь и глушь, эта зелень, эти длинные холмы, овраги с приземистыми дубовыми кустами, серые деревеньки, жидкие березы – вся эта, давно им не виданная, русская картина навевала на его душу сладкие и в то же время почти скорбные чувства, давила грудь его каким-то приятным давлением. Мысли его медленно бродили; очертания их были так же неясны и смутны, как очертания тех высоких, тоже как будто бы бродивших, тучек. Вспомнил он свое детство, свою мать, вспомнил, как она умирала, как поднесли его к ней и как она, прижимая его голову к своей груди, начала было слабо голосить над ним, да взглянула на Глафиру Петровну – и умолкла. Вспомнил он отца, сперва бодрого, всем недовольного, с медным голосом, потом слепого, плаксивого, с неопрятной седой бородой; вспомнил, как он однажды за столом, выпив лишнюю рюмку вина и залив себе салфетку соусом, вдруг засмеялся и начал, мигая ничего не видевшими глазами и краснея, рассказывать про свои победы; вспомнил Варвару Павловну – и невольно прищурился, как щурится человек от мгновенной внутренней боли, и встряхнул головой. Потом мысль его остановилась на Лизе.","Four hours later he was driving home. His tarantass rolled quickly along the soft country road. There had been a drought for two weeks; a thin mist spread like milk in the air and veiled the distant forests; he smelled of burning. Many darkish clouds with indistinctly outlined edges spread across the pale blue sky; a rather strong wind rushed in a dry continuous stream, not dispersing the heat. Leaning his head against the pillow and crossing his arms, Lavretsky gazed at the paddocks of the fields passing like a fan, at the slowly flashing willows, at the stupid crows and rooks, gazing with dull suspicion sideways at the passing carriage, at the long demarcations overgrown with Chernobyl, wormwood and mountain ash; he looked ... and this fresh, steppe, fat wilderness and wilderness, this greenery, these long hills, ravines with squat oak bushes, gray villages, liquid birches - all this Russian picture, which he had not seen for a long time, evoked sweet and in at the same time, almost mournful feelings pressed on his chest with some pleasant pressure. His thoughts wandered slowly; their outlines were just as indistinct and vague as the outlines of those high clouds, which also seemed to be wandering about. He remembered his childhood, his mother, he remembered how she was dying, how they brought him to her, and how she, pressing his head to her chest, began weakly wailing over him, but looked at Glafira Petrovna - and fell silent. He remembered his father, at first cheerful, dissatisfied with everything, with a brassy voice, then blind, whining, with an untidy gray beard; he remembered how one day at the table, after drinking an extra glass of wine and pouring sauce over his napkin, he suddenly laughed and began, blinking his unseeing eyes and blushing, to tell about his victories; he remembered Varvara Pavlovna, and involuntarily narrowed his eyes, as a man squints from an instantaneous inner pain, and shook his head. Then his thoughts settled on Liza.","FOUR hours later he was on his way home. His tarantass bowled briskly along the soft surface of a country road. There had been dry weather for a couple of weeks; a faint mist pervaded the air like milk and hid the far woods; it had a fragrance of burning. A mass of darkling clouds with vaguely defined edges crawled across the pale blue sky; a fairly strong breeze hurried in a dry uninterrupted stream over the land, but did not disperse the heat. Laying his head back on a cushion and folding his arms, Lavretsky gazed at the rows of fields which passed in a fan-wise movement, at the willows which slowly passed into and out of sight, at the stupid rooks and crows which looked out of the corners of their eyes in dull suspiciousness at the passing carriage, at the long boundaries between the fields overgrown with ragwort, wormwood and field rowans; he gazed… and this fresh, lush nakedness and wilderness of the steppe, this greenery, these long low hills, the ravines with their ground-hugging clumps of oak trees, the grey little villages, the flowing shapes of birches – the whole of this picture of Russia, which he had not seen for so long, evoked in him sweet and simultaneously anguished feelings and oppressed his heart with a kind of pleasant sadness. His thoughts took a slow wandering course; their outlines were as vague and troubled as the outlines of those high and also seemingly wandering clouds. He recalled his childhood, his mother, recalled how, as she lay dying, they had brought him to her and how she, pressing his head to her breast, had just begun a feeble lamenting over him, but had glanced up at Glafira Petrovna – and stopped. He remembered his father, at first hale and hearty, dissatisfied with everything, speaking in his brassy voice, and then blind and querulous, with an untidy grey beard; he remembered how once at table, having drunk a glass too much of wine and spilt the gravy over his napkin, his father had suddenly burst out laughing and begun, winking his sightless eyes and blushing, to speak of his conquests; he remembered Varvara Pavlovna – and winced despite himself, as a man winces from a momentary internal pain, and shook his head. Then his thoughts concentrated on Liza.","Four days later, he set off for home. His coach rolled quickly along the soft cross-road. There had been no rain for a fortnight; a fine milk mist was diffused in the air and hung over the distant woods; a smell of burning came from it. A multitude of darkish clouds with blurred edges were creeping across the pale blue sky; a fairly strong breeze blew a dry and steady gale, without dispelling the heat. Leaning back with his head on the cushion and his arms crossed on his breast, Lavretsky watched the furrowed fields unfolding like a fan before him, the willow bushes as they slowly came into sight, and the dull ravens and rooks, who looked sidelong with stupid suspicion at the approaching carriage, the long ditches, overgrown with mugwort, wormwood, and mountain ash; and as he watched the fresh fertile wilderness and solitude of this steppe country, the greenness, the long slopes, and valleys with stunted oak bushes, the grey villages, and scant birch trees,—the whole Russian landscape, so long unseen by him, stirred emotion at once pleasant, sweet and almost painful in his heart, and he felt weighed down by a kind of pleasant oppression. Slowly his thoughts wandered; their outlines were as vague and indistinct as the outlines of the clouds which seemed to be wandering at random overhead. He remembered his childhood, his mother; he remembered her death, how they had carried him in to her, and how, clasping his head to her bosom, she had begun to wail over him, then had glanced at Glafira Petrovna—and checked herself. He remembered his father, at first vigorous, discontented with everything, with strident voice; and later, blind, tearful, with unkempt grey beard; he remembered how one day after drinking a glass too much at dinner, and spilling the gravy over his napkin, he began to relate his conquests, growing red in the face, and winking with his sightless eyes; he remember Varvara Pavlovna,—and involuntarily shuddered, as a man shudders from a sudden internal pain, and shook his head. Then his! thoughts came to a stop at Lisa."
– Про это я знаю. Лаврецкий вдруг встрепенулся.,- I know about it. Lavretsky suddenly started up.,‘That is my business.’ Lavretsky suddenly shuddered all over.,“That I know myself.” Lavretsky started suddenly.
"– Пожалуйста, играйте, – поспешно подхватил Лаврецкий, – не обращайте внимания на меня. Мне самому будет приятнее, когда я буду знать, что я вас не стесняю. А занимать вам меня нечего; у нашего брата, старика, есть занятие, которого вы еще не ведаете и которого никакое развлечение заменить не может: воспоминания.","“Please, play,” Lavretsky hastily picked up, “pay no attention to me. I myself will be more pleasant when I know that I do not embarrass you. And you have nothing to occupy me; our brother, the old man, has an occupation that you still do not know and that no amount of entertainment can replace: reminiscences.","‘Please, do play,’ Lavretsky said hurriedly. ‘Don’t pay any attention to me. It’ll be much pleasanter for me if I know that I’m not in your way. Don’t feel you have to entertain me; we old people have an entertainment of our own, which you don’t know about yet and which can’t be replaced by any other: our memories.’","“Please, play your games,” Lavretsky hastened to interpose; “don’t pay attention to me. I shall be happier myself, when I am sure I am not in your way. And there’s no need for you to entertain me; we old fellows have an occupation which you know nothing of yet, and which no amusement can replace—our memories.”"
"– Помилуйте, первый кавалер у нас, да не только у нас – et a Petersbourg. Камер-юнкер, в лучшем обществе принят.

"– Ты, пожалуйста, не вздумай отговариваться, – продолжала Марфа Тимофеевна. – Шурочка сама все видела и мне сказала. Я ей запретила болтать, а она не солжет.","“Please, don’t try to make excuses,” continued Marfa Timofeevna. “Shurochka saw everything herself and told me. I forbade her to talk, but she won't lie.","‘Please don’t try denying it,’ Marfa Timofeyevna continued. ‘ Shurochka herself saw everything and has told me.

I have had to forbid her chattering, but she is not a liar.”"
"– Нет. Я был поражен; но откуда было взяться слезам? Плакать о прошедшем – да ведь оно у меня все выжжено!.. Самый проступок ее не разрушил мое счастие, а доказал мне только, что его вовсе никогда не бывало. О чем же тут было плакать? Впрочем, кто знает? Я, может быть, был бы более огорчен, если б я получил это известие двумя неделями раньше…","- Not. I was amazed; but where did the tears come from? To weep over the past—why, it’s all scorched out of me!.. Her very transgression did not destroy my happiness, but only proved to me that it had never happened at all. What was there to cry about? However, who knows? Perhaps I would have been more distressed if I had received this news two weeks earlier...","‘And didn’t you… didn’t you even cry?’ ‘No. I was staggered; but where was I to get tears from? There was no point in crying over the past when it had all been burnt out of me! Her misconduct did not destroy my happiness, but simply proved to me that it had never existed. What was there to cry about? However, who knows? I might have been more saddened if I’d received this news a fortnight earlier…’","“No. I was thunderstruck; but where were tears to come from? Should I weep over the past? but it is utterly extinct for me! Her very fault did not destroy my happiness, but only showed me that it had never been at all. What is there to weep over now? Though indeed, who knows? I might, perhaps, have been more grieved if I had got this news a fortnight sooner.”"
"– Да, не всех же ему пленять. Будет с него и того, что вот Настасья Карповна в него влюблена. Бедная вдова вся всполошилась.","- Yes, he does not captivate everyone. It will also come from him that Nastasya Karpovna is in love with him. The poor widow was all alarmed.","‘He can’t captivate everyone, that’s all. It’s enough for him that Nastasya Karpovna’s fallen in love with him.’ The poor widow was utterly confounded.","“No, he can’t fascinate every one. He must be satisfied with Nastasya Karpovna’s being in love with him.” The poor widow was utterly dismayed."
"– Как вы понимаете, – нет.","- As you can see, no.",‘As you understand it – no.’,“As you understand it—no.”

Lavretsky repeated louder and stepped out of the shadow of the alley.,‘Liza!’ Lavretsky repeated more loudly and stepped out of the shadows of the avenue.,"“Lisa!” Lavretsky repeated louder, and he came out of the shadow of the avenue."
"– Вы то же самое и в тех же самых выражениях сказали мне четвертого дня. Я желаю знать, любите ли вы его тем сильным, страстным чувством, которое мы привыкли называть любовью?","- You said the same thing to me in the same expressions on the fourth day. I want to know if you love him with that strong, passionate feeling that we used to call love?","‘You told me the same thing in the same terms three days ago. I want to know whether you love him with that strong, passionate feeling which we are accustomed to call love?’","“You said the very same thing, and in the very same words, three days ago.

"Не доверяя искусству русских врачей, он стал хлопотать о позволении отправиться за границу. Ему отказали. Тогда он взял с собою сына и целых три года проскитался по России от одного доктора к другому, беспрестанно переезжая из города в город и приводя в отчаяние врачей, сына, прислугу своим малодушием и нетерпением. Совершенной тряпкой, плаксивым и капризным ребенком воротился он в Лаврики. Наступили горькие денечки, натерпелись от него все. Иван Петрович утихал только, пока обедал; никогда он так жадно и так много не ел; все остальное время он ни себе, никому не давал покоя. Он молился, роптал на судьбу, бранил себя, бранил политику, свою систему, бранил все, чем хвастался и кичился, все, что ставил некогда сыну в образец; твердил, что ни во что не верит, и молился снова; не выносил ни одного мгновенья одиночества и требовал от своих домашних, чтоб они постоянно, днем и ночью, сидели возле его кресел и занимали его рассказами, которые он то и дело прерывал восклицаниями: «Вы все врете – экая чепуха!»","Not trusting the art of Russian doctors, he began to petition for permission to go abroad. He was refused. Then he took his son with him and for three whole years wandered around Russia from one doctor to another, constantly moving from city to city and bringing doctors, his son, and servants to despair with his cowardice and impatience. A perfect rag, a whiny and capricious child, he returned to Lavriki. Bitter days came, everyone suffered from him. Ivan Petrovich subsided only while he was having dinner; he had never eaten so greedily and so much; the rest of the time he did not give himself or anyone rest. He prayed, grumbled at fate, scolded himself, scolded politics, his system, scolded everything he boasted and boasted about, everything that he once set as a model for his son; insisted that he did not believe in anything, and prayed again; he could not stand a single moment of loneliness and demanded from his family that they constantly, day and night, sit near his armchairs and occupy him with stories, which he now and then interrupted with exclamations: “You are all lying - what nonsense!”","Mistrusting the expertise of Russian doctors, he began to petition to be allowed to go abroad. He was refused. Then he took his son with him and for three whole years wandered about Russia from one doctor to another, ceaselessly travelling from town to town and driving the doctors, his son and his servants to despair through his cowardice and impatience. He was an utterly wet rag, like a snivelling and capricious child, when he returned to Lavriki. Bitter, miserable days ensued, in which everyone had to put up with a great deal from him. Ivan Petrovich ceased his tantrums only at mealtimes; he had never eaten so greedily or so much; the rest of the time he gave no peace to himself or others. He prayed, fretted at his fate, scolded himself, scolded his politics and his system, blasphemed against all the things of which he had previously boasted and been proud, against everything which he had once extolled as an example to his son; he repeatedly asserted that he had no faith, and repeatedly started praying again; he could not stand being left alone for an instant and insisted that his servants should sit constantly beside his armchair, both day and night, and entertain him with stories which he would interrupt from time to time by exclaiming: ‘You’re telling a pack of lies! What bloody nonsense!’","Having no confidence in the skill of Russian doctors, he began to make efforts to obtain permission to go abroad. It was refused. Then he took his son with him and for three whole years was wandering about Russia, from one doctor to another, incessantly moving from one town to another, and driving his physicians, his son, and his servants to despair by his cowardice and impatience. He returned to Lavriky a perfect wreck, a tearful and capricious child. Bitter days followed, every one had much to put up with from him. Ivan Petrovitch was only quiet when he was dining; he had never been so greedy and eaten so much; all the rest of the time he gave himself and others no peace. He prayed, cursed his fate, abused himself, abused politics, his system, abused everything he had boasted of and prided himself upon, everything he had held up to his son as a model; he declared that he believed in nothing and then began to pray again; he could not put up with one instant of solitude, and expected his household to sit by his chair continually day and night, and entertain him with stories, which he constantly interrupted with exclamations, “You are for ever lying,... a pack of nonsense!”"
"Произнося последние два стиха, Михалевич чуть не заплакал; легкие судороги – признак сильного чувства – пробежали по его широким губам, некрасивое лицо его просветлело. Лаврецкий слушал его, слушал… дух противоречия зашевелился в нем: его раздражала всегда готовая, постоянно кипучая восторженность московского студента. Четверти часа не прошло, как уже загорелся между ними спор, один из тех нескончаемых споров, на который способны только русские люди. С оника, после многолетней разлуки, проведенной в двух различных мирах, не понимая ясно ни чужих, ни даже собственных мыслей, цепляясь за слова и возражая одними словами, заспорили они о предметах самых отвлеченных – и спорили так, как будто дело шло о жизни и смерти обоих: голосили и вопили так, что все люди всполошились в доме, а бедный Лемм, который с самого приезда Михалевича заперся у себя в комнате, почувствовал недоуменье и начал даже чего-то смутно бояться.","Saying the last two verses, Mikhalevich almost burst into tears; slight convulsions - a sign of strong feelings - ran over his wide lips, his ugly face brightened. Lavretsky listened to him, listened ... the spirit of contradiction stirred in him: he was irritated by the always ready, constantly seething enthusiasm of a Moscow student. A quarter of an hour had not passed before an argument broke out between them, one of those endless disputes that only Russian people are capable of. With Onik, after many years of separation, spent in two different worlds, not clearly understanding either other people's or even their own thoughts, clinging to words and arguing with mere words, they argued about the most abstract subjects - and argued as if it were a matter of life and death of both: they were wailing and screaming so that all the people in the house were alarmed, and poor Lemm, who had locked himself in his room since the arrival of Mikhalevich, felt bewildered and even began to be vaguely afraid of something.","Speaking the last two lines, Mikhalevich almost broke down and cried; slight quiverings – the sign of strong feeling – flitted across his broad lips and his unattractive face lit up. Lavretsky listened and listened to him – and a spirit of opposition stirred within him: he was irritated by the ever-ready, continuously effervescent exultation of the Moscow student. A quarter of an hour had hardly passed before an argument sprang up between them, one of those interminable arguments of which only Russians are capable. From the outset, after many years of separation spent in two different worlds, without clearly understanding others’ or even their own ideas, latching on to words and bandying words about, they became embroiled in an argument about the most abstract matters – and they argued as if it were a matter of life and death for both of them: literally bayed and howled, so that everyone in the house was in a state of commotion, and the wretched Lemm, who ever since Mikhalevich’s arrival had locked himself in his room, felt quite put out and even began to be vaguely frightened.","As he uttered the two last lines, Mihalevitch all but shed tears; a slight spasm—the sign of deep emotion—passed over his wide mouth, his ugly face lighted up. Lavretsky listened, and listened to him—and the spirit of antagonism was aroused in him; he was irritated by the ever-ready enthusiasm of the Moscow student, perpetually at boiling-point. Before a quarter of an hour had elapsed a heated argument had broken out between them, one of these endless arguments, of which only Russians are capable. After a separation of many years spent in two different worlds, with no clear understanding of the other’s ideas or even of their own, catching at words and replying only in words, they disputed about the most abstract subjects, and they disputed as though it were a matter of life and death for both: they shouted and vociferated so that every one in the house was startled, and poor Lemm, who had locked himself up in his room directly after Mihalevitch arrived, was bewildered, and began even to feel vaguely alarmed."
"Иван Петрович вернулся в Россию англоманом. Коротко остриженные волосы, накрахмаленное жабо, долгополый гороховый сюртук со множеством воротничков, кислое выражение лица, что-то резкое и вместе равнодушное в обращении, произношение сквозь зубы, деревянный внезапный хохот, отсутствие улыбки, исключительно политический и политико-экономический разговор, страсть к кровавым ростбифам и портвейну – все в нем так и веяло Великобританией; весь он казался пропитан ее духом. Но – чудное дело! – превратившись в англомана, Иван Петрович стал в то же время патриотом, по крайней мере он называл себя патриотом, хотя Россию знал плохо, не придерживался ни одной русской привычки и по-русски изъяснялся странно: в обыкновенной беседе речь его, неповоротливая и вялая, вся пестрела галлицизмами; но чуть разговор касался предметов важных, у Ивана Петровича тотчас являлись выражения вроде: «оказать новые опыты самоусердия», «сие не согласуется с самою натурою обстоятельства» и т. д. Иван Петрович привез с собою несколько рукописных планов, касавшихся до устройства и улучшения государства; он очень был недоволен всем, что видел, – отсутствие системы в особенности возбуждало его желчь. При свидании с сестрою он с первых же слов объявил ей, что он намерен ввести коренные преобразования, что впредь у него все будет идти по новой системе. Глафира Петровна ничего не отвечала Ивану Петровичу, только зубы стиснула и подумала: «Куда же я-то денусь?» Впрочем, приехавши в деревню вместе с братом и племянником, она скоро успокоилась. В доме точно произошли некоторые перемены: приживальщики и тунеядцы подверглись немедленному изгнанию; в числе их пострадали две старухи, одна – слепая, другая – разбитая параличом, да еще дряхлый майор очаковских времен, которого, по причине его действительно замечательной жадности, кормили одним черным хлебом да чечевицей. Также вышел приказ не принимать прежних гостей: всех их заменил дальний сосед, какой-то белокурый золотушный барон, очень хорошо воспитанный и очень глупый человек. Появились новые мебели из Москвы; завелись плевательницы, колокольчики, умывальные столики; завтрак стал иначе подаваться; иностранные вина изгнали водки и наливки; людям пошили новые ливреи; к фамильному гербу прибавилась подпись: «In recto virtus…»[10]. В сущности же власть Глафиры нисколько не уменьшилась: все выдачи, покупки по-прежнему от нее зависели; вывезенный из-за границы камердинер из эльзасцев попытался было с нею потягаться – и лишился места, несмотря на то, что барин ему покровительствовал. Что же до хозяйства, до управления имениями (Глафира Петровна входила и в эти дела), то, несмотря на неоднократно выраженное Иваном Петровичем намерение: вдохнуть новую жизнь в этот хаос, – все осталось по-старому, только оброк кой-где прибавился, да барщина стала потяжелее, да мужикам запретили обращаться прямо к Ивану Петровичу. Патриот* очень уж презирал своих сограждан. Система Ивана Петровича в полной силе своей применена была только к Феде; воспитание его действительно подверглось «коренному преобразованию»: отец исключительно занялся им.","Ivan Petrovich returned to Russia as an English lover. Short-cropped hair, a starched frill, a long-brimmed pea frock coat with many collars, a sour expression on his face, something sharp and at the same time indifferent in his address, pronunciation through teeth, sudden wooden laughter, lack of a smile, exclusively political and political-economic conversation, passion for bloody roast beef and port wine - everything in it blew the Great Britain; he seemed to be saturated with her spirit. But - a wonderful thing! - having turned into an Anglophile, Ivan Petrovich became at the same time a patriot, at least he called himself a patriot, although he knew Russia poorly, did not adhere to a single Russian habit and spoke in Russian strangely: in an ordinary conversation his speech, clumsy and lethargic, all full of gallicisms; but as soon as the conversation touched on important subjects, Ivan Petrovich immediately had expressions like: “to make new experiments of self-zeal”, “this is not consistent with the very nature of the circumstances”, etc. Ivan Petrovich brought with him several handwritten plans concerning the arrangement and improvement states; he was very dissatisfied with everything he saw - the absence of a system in particular aroused his bile. When meeting with his sister, he announced to her from the very first words that he intended to introduce radical changes, that from now on everything would go according to the new system. Glafira Petrovna made no answer to Ivan Petrovich, only clenched her teeth and thought: ""Where am I going to go?"" However, having arrived in the village with her brother and nephew, she soon calmed down. Some changes certainly took place in the house: hangers-on and parasites were immediately expelled; among them were two old women, one blind, the other paralyzed, and even a decrepit major of the Ochakov era, who, because of his really remarkable greed, was fed only black bread and lentils. Also, an order was issued not to receive the previous guests: they were all replaced by a distant neighbor, some kind of blond, scrofulous baron, a very well-mannered and very stupid person. There were new furniture from Moscow; there were spittoons, bells, washstands; breakfast was served differently; foreign wines banished vodkas and liqueurs; the people were given new liveries; the signature was added to the family coat of arms: “In recto virtus…”[10]. In essence, the power of Glafira did not decrease at all: all extraditions, purchases, as before, depended on her; the Alsatian valet, taken from abroad, tried to compete with her - and lost his place, despite the fact that the master patronized him. As for the economy, to the management of estates (Glafira Petrovna was also involved in these affairs), then, despite Ivan Petrovich’s intention repeatedly expressed: to breathe new life into this chaos, everything remained as before, only the quitrent was added here and there, yes corvee became harder, and the peasants were forbidden to address Ivan Petrovich directly. The patriot * really despised his fellow citizens. Ivan Petrovich's system, in its full force, was applied only to Fedya; his upbringing really underwent a ""radical transformation"": his father exclusively took care of him.","IVAN PETROVICH returned to Russia an Anglomaniac. With his hair cut short, the starched frill on his shirt-front, the long pea-green frock-coat with its multitude of collars, a sour expression on his face, something both brusque and negligent in his manner, the pronunciation of words through his teeth, a sudden wooden laugh, lack of smiles, exclusively political and politico-economic talk, a passion for underdone roast-beef and port wine – everything about him literally reeked of Great Britain; he seemed to be entirely saturated in its spirit. But – wonders will never cease! – having turned himself into an Anglomaniac, Ivan Petrovich at the same time became a patriot, or at least he called himself a patriot, although he did not know Russia well, did not uphold a single Russian custom and had a strange way of expressing himself in Russian: in ordinary conversation his speech, cumbersome and flaccid, was profusely dotted with Gallicisms; but as soon as a conversation turned on important matters, there at once appeared on Ivan Petrovich’s lips expressions such as: ‘Occasion new lessons in self-endeavour’, ‘that does not accord, egad, with the very nature of the circumstances’ and so on. Ivan Petrovich brought with him several draft plans which were concerned with the arrangement and improvement of the estate; he was very dissatisfied with everything he saw – the absence of system particularly aroused his bitter animosity. Upon seeing his sister his very first words to her were a declaration that he intended to introduce radical changes and that from henceforth in his house everything would be run on a new system. Glafira Petrovna made no answer to Ivan Petrovich apart from gritting her teeth and mentally asking herself: ‘I wonder where I’ll fit into all this?’ However, having arrived at the country estate along with her brother and nephew, she was soon consoled. Certain changes were certainly made in the house: the spongers and parasites underwent immediate expulsion; among those who suffered were two old women, one blind, the other afflicted by paralysis, and a decrepit major of Ochakov days who, by virtue of his truly remarkable greediness, had been fed exclusively on black bread and lentils. An order was also issued not to receive former guests: they were all superseded by a distant neighbour, some fair-haired scrofulous baron, who was a very well-educated and very stupid fellow. New furniture appeared from Moscow; spittoons, hand-bells for the table and wash-hand-stands were introduced; lunch was served in a new way; foreign wines ousted vodka and native spirits; the servants had new liveries made for them; the family crest had the words In recto virtus… added to it. In essence Glafira’s authority was in no way reduced: the responsibility for all outgoings and purchases still rested with her; the valet from Alsace, who had been brought from abroad, attempted to cross swords with her – and lost his post despite the fact that the master of the house was his patron. So far as the economics and management of the estate were concerned (Glafira Petrovna went into all these matters), despite Ivan Petrovich’s repeatedly expressed intention to breathe new life into this chaos, everything remained as before, save that quit-rent payments were increased here and there and the compulsory work on the master’s land was made more onerous, and the peasants were forbidden to approach Ivan Petrovich directly. The patriot had a very low opinion of his fellow citizens. Ivan Petrovich’s system was applied in full force only to Fedya; his education really underwent ‘radical transformation’: his father concerned himself with it to the exclusion of all else.","Ivan Petrovitch returned to Russia an Anglomaniac. His short-cropped hair, his starched shirt-front, his long-skirted pea-green overcoat with its multitude of capes, the sour expression of his face, something abrupt and at the same time indifferent in his behaviour, his way of speaking through his teeth, his sudden wooden laugh, the absence of smiles, his exclusively political or politic-economical conversation, his passion for roast beef and port wine—everything about him breathed, so to speak, of Great Britain. But, marvelous to relate, while he had been transformed into an Anglomaniac, Ivan Petrovitch had at the same time become a patriot, at least he called himself a patriot, though he knew Russia little, had not retained a single Russian habit, and expressed himself in Russian rather queerly; in ordinary conversation, his language was spiritless and inanimate and constantly interspersed with Gallicisms. Ivan Petrovitch brought with him a few schemes in manuscript, relating to the administration and reform of the government; he was much displeased with everything he saw; the lack of system especially aroused his spleen. On his meeting with his sister, at the first word he announced to her that he was determined to introduce radical reforms, that henceforth everything to do with him would be on a different system. Glafira Petrovna made no reply to Ivan Petrovitch; she only ground her teeth and thought: “Where am I to take refuge?” After she was back in the country, however, with her brother and nephew, her fears were soon set at rest. In the house, certainly, some changes were made; idlers and dependants met with summary dismissal; among them two old women were made to suffer, one blind, another broken down by paralysis; and also a decrepit major of the days of Catherine, who, on account of his really abnormal appetite, was fed on nothing but black bread and lentils. The order went forth not to admit the guests of former days; they were replaced by a distant neighbour, a certain fair-haired, scrofulous baron, a very well educated and very stupid man. New furniture was brought from Moscow; spittoons were introduced, and bells and washing-stands; and breakfast began to be served in a different way; foreign wines replaced vodka and syrups; the servants were put into new livery; a motto was added to the family arms: in recto virtus... In reality, Glafira’s power suffered no diminution; the giving out and buying of stores still depended on her. The Alsatian steward, brought from abroad, tried to fight it out with her and lost his place, in spite of the master’s protection. As for the management of the house, and the administration of the estate, Glafira Petrovna had undertaken these duties also; in spite of Ivan Petrovitch’s intention,—more than once expressed—to breathe new life into this chaos, everything remained as before; only the rent was in some places raised, the mistress was more strict, and the peasants were forbidden to apply direct to Ivan Petrovitch. The patriot had already a great contempt for his fellow-countrymen. Ivan Petrovitch’s system was applied in its full force only to Fedya; his education really underwent a “radical reformation;” his father devoted himself exclusively to it."

"Старушка, сидевшая с Марьей Дмитриевной под окошком, была та самая тетка, сестра ее отца, с которою она провела некогда несколько уединенных лет в Покровском. Звали ее Марфой Тимофеевной Пестовой. Она слыла чудачкой, нрав имела независимый, говорила всем правду в глаза и при самых скудных средствах держалась так, как будто за ней водились тысячи. Она терпеть не могла покойного Калитина и, как только ее племянница вышла за него замуж, удалилась в свою деревушку, где прожила целых десять лет у мужика в курной избе. Марья Дмитриевна ее побаивалась. Черноволосая и быстроглазая даже в старости, маленькая, востроносая, Марфа Тимофеевна ходила живо, держалась прямо и говорила скоро и внятно, тонким и звучным голоском. 0,на постоянно носила белый чепец и белую кофту.","The old woman who sat with Marya Dmitrievna under the window was the same aunt, her father's sister, with whom she had once spent several solitary years in Pokrovsky.

She could not stand the late Kalitin and, as soon as her niece married him, she retired to her village, where she lived for ten whole years with a peasant in a chicken hut. Marya Dmitrievna was afraid of her.

Я, слава богу, заслужила, могу сказать, всеобщее уважение и ничего неприличного ни за что на свете не сделаю. Хоть я и предвидела, что это будет вам неприятно, однако я не решилась отказать ей, Федор Иваныч; она мне родственница – по вас: войдите в мое положение, какое же я имела право отказать ей от дома, – согласитесь?","- Well, yes, that is, I wanted to say: she came to me, and I received her; this is what I want to explain to you now, Fyodor Ivanitch. I, thank God, have earned, I can say, universal respect and I will not do anything indecent for anything in the world. Although I foresaw that this would be unpleasant for you, however, I did not dare to refuse her, Fyodor Ivanovich; she is a relative of mine - according to you: enter into my position, what right did I have to refuse her from the house - agree?","‘Yes, well, what I meant was: she has come to me and I have received her; now this is what I want to talk to you about, Fyodor Ivanych. I, thank God, have earned, I can say, universal respect and I will not do something improper for anything in the world. Although I foresaw that it would not be pleasant for you, I could not resolve to refuse her, Fyodor Ivanych; she is related to me – through you; appreciate my position, what right had I to refuse her entry to my house? Do you agree?’","“Well, then, that is, I wanted to say, she came to me, and I received her; that is what I wanted to explain to you, Fedor Ivanitch. Thank God I have, I may say, gained universal respect, and for no consideration in the world would I do anything improper. Though I foresaw that it would be disagreeable to you, still I could not make up my mind to deny myself to her, Fedor Ivanitch; she is a relation of mine—through you; put yourself in my position, what right had I to shut my doors on her—you will agree with me?”"
"Он застал всех дома, но он не тотчас объявил им о своем намерении; он хотел сперва переговорить наедине с Лизой. Случай помог ему: их оставили вдвоем в гостиной. Они разговорились; она успела уже привыкнуть к нему, – да она и вообще никого не дичилась. Он слушал ее, глядел ей в лицо и мысленно твердил слова Лемма, соглашался с ним. Случается иногда, что два уже знакомых, но не близких друг другу человека внезапно и быстро сближаются в течение нескольких мгновений – и сознание этого сближения тотчас выражается в их взглядах, в их дружелюбных и тихих усмешках, в самых их движениях. Именно это случилось с Лаврецким и Лизой. «Вот он какой», – подумала она, ласково глядя на него; «вот ты какая», – подумал и он. А потому он не очень удивился, когда она, не без маленькой, однако, запинки, объявила ему, что давно имеет на сердце сказать ему что-то, но боится его рассердить.","He found everyone at home, but he did not immediately announce his intention to them; he wanted to have a private talk with Lisa first. The case helped him: they were left alone in the living room. They got into a conversation; she had already grown accustomed to him—and, in general, she was not shy at anyone. He listened to her, looked into her face and mentally repeated the words of Lemm, agreed with him. It sometimes happens that two people who are already familiar, but not close to each other, suddenly and quickly approach each other within a few moments - and the consciousness of this rapprochement is immediately expressed in their glances, in their friendly and quiet smiles, in their very movements. This is exactly what happened to Lavretsky and Lisa. “Here he is,” she thought, looking at him affectionately; “Here you are,” he thought. And so he was not very surprised when she, however, not without a slight hesitation, announced to him that she had long had in her heart to tell him something, but was afraid to anger him.","HE found everybody at home, but he did not announce his intention at once; he wanted first to discuss the matter alone with Liza. An occasion helped him: they were left alone together in the drawing-room. They struck up a conversation; she had already grown used to him – indeed, she was generally socially at her ease with anyone. He listened to her, gazed into her face and mentally repeated Lemm’s words about her, agreeing with him. It sometimes happens that two already familiar, but not intimate, people suddenly and rapidly draw closer to each other in the course of a few moments – and an awareness of this intimacy is immediately expressed in their looks, in their calm and friendly smiles, and in their very movements. This is precisely what happened to Lavretsky and Liza. ‘ So that’s what he’s like ,’ she thought, looking fondly at him; ‘so that’s what you’re like,’ he thought as well. So that he was not very surprised when she, not of course without a little hesitation , announced to him that she had long had it in her heart to say something to him, but had been frightened of annoying him.","He found them all at home, but he did not at once disclose his plan to them; he wanted to discuss it first with Lisa alone. Fortune favoured him; they were left alone in the drawing-room. They had some talk; she had had time by now to grow used to him—and she was not shy as a rule with any one. He listened to her, watched her, and mentally repeated Lemm’s words, and agreed with them. It sometimes happens that two people who are acquainted, but not on intimate terms with one another, all of sudden grow rapidly more intimate in a few minutes, and the consciousness of this greater intimacy is at once expressed in their eyes, in their soft and affectionate smiles, and in their very gestures. This was exactly what came to pass with Lavretsky and Lisa. “So he is like that,” was her thought, as she turned a friendly glance on him; “so you are like that,” he too was thinking. And so he was not very much surprised when she informed him, not without a little faltering, however, that she had long wished to say something to him, but she was afraid of offending him."
"Лаврецкому стало жаль старика; он попросил у него прощения. Лемм после чая сыграл ему свою кантату, а за обедом, вызванный самим Лаврецким, опять разговорился о Лизе. Лаврецкий слушал его со вниманием и любопытством.","Lavretsky felt sorry for the old man; he asked for his forgiveness. Lemm played his cantata for him after tea, and at dinner, summoned by Lavretsky himself, he again began talking about Lisa. Lavretsky listened to him with attention and curiosity.","Lavretsky felt pity for the old man and asked his forgiveness. After tea Lemm played him his cantata, and over dinner, provoked into doing so by Lavretsky himself, he again spoke about Liza. Lavretsky listened to him with attention and curiosity.","Lavretsky felt sorry for the old man; he begged his pardon. After morning tea, Lemm played him his cantata, and after dinner, at Lavretsky’s initiative, there was again talk of Lisa. Lavretsky listened to him with attention and curiosity."
"– А тому назначается, – возразила она, – кто никогда не сплетничает, не хитрит и не сочиняет, если только есть на свете такой человек. Федю я знаю хорошо; он только тем и виноват, что баловал жену. Ну, да и женился он по любви, а из этих из любовных свадеб ничего путного никогда не выходит, – прибавила старушка, косвенно взглянув на Марью Дмитриевну и вставая. – А ты теперь, мой батюшка, на ком угодно зубки точи, хоть на мне; я уйду, мешать не буду. И Марфа Тимофеевна удалилась.","“And he is appointed,” she objected, “who never gossips, does not cheat and does not compose, if only there is such a person in the world. I know Fedya well; he is only to blame for spoiling his wife. Well, yes, and he married for love, and nothing worthwhile ever comes out of these love weddings, ”added the old woman, looking indirectly at Marya Dmitrievna and getting up. - And now, my father, sharpen your teeth on anyone, even on me; I'll leave, I won't interfere. And Marfa Timofeevna left.","‘It is intended for someone’, she replied, ‘who never gossips, is never underhand and never makes up stories, if there is such a person in the world. I know Fedya well. All he can be blamed for is spoiling his wife. Well, yes, of course, he also married for love, and nothing worth while ever comes of love matches.’ the old woman added, glancing sideways at Marya Dmitrievna and rising to her feet. ‘ And now you, my good sir, can sharpen your teeth on anyone you like, even on me; I’m going, I won’t be any more bother to you.’ And Marfa Timofeyevna went out.","“It’s intended,” she replied, “for a man who does not talk scandal, nor play the hypocrite, nor tell lies, if there’s such a man to be found in the world. I know Fedya well; he was only to blame in being too good to his wife. To be sure, he married for love, and no good ever comes of those love-matches,” added the old lady, with a sidelong glance at Marya Dmitrievna, as she got up from her place. “And now, my good sir, you may attack any one you like, even me if you choose; I’m going. I will not hinder you.” And Marfa Timofyevna walked away."
"– Что вы хотите сказать? – промолвила она, не поднимая глаз.",- What do you want to say? she said without looking up.,"‘What do you mean?’ she asked, without raising her eyes.","“What do you mean?” she said, not raising her eyes."
"– Да, он ручки у тебя все лижет. По-французски но говорит, – эка беда! Я сама не сильна во французском «диалехте». Лучше бы он ни по-каковски не говорил: не лгал бы. Да вот он, кстати, легок на помине, – прибавила Марфа Тимофеевна, глянув на улицу. – Вон он шагает, твой приятный человек. Экой длинный, словно аист!","Yes, he licks your hands. He speaks French, but what a disaster! I myself am not strong in the French ""dialecht"". It would be better if he didn’t speak in any way: he wouldn’t lie. Why, by the way, he is easy to remember, ”added Marfa Timofeevna, glancing into the street. “Here he is walking, your pleasant man. What a long, like a stork!","‘Agreeable, yes, because he’s always kissing your hands. So he doesn’t speak French – a great pity that is! I’m not very strong myself in the French “dialect”. It’d be better if he didn’t speak any language at all, then he wouldn’t tell lies. But there he is, speak of the devil,’ added Marfa Timofeyevna, glancing at the street. ‘Striding along, he is, your agreeable man. What a long, thin fellow, just like a stork!’","“Yes, he is always ready to kiss your hands. He does not speak French— that’s no great loss. I am not over strong in the French lingo myself. It would be better if he could not speak at all; he would not tell lies then. But here he is—speak of the devil,” added Marfa Timofyevna looking into the street. “Here comes your agreeable man striding along. What a lanky creature he is, just like a stork!”"
"А Лаврецкий вернулся в дом, вошел в столовую, приблизился к фортепьяно и коснулся одной из клавиш; раздался слабый, но чистый звук и тайно задрожал у него в сердце: этой нотой начиналась та вдохновенная мелодия, которой, давно тому назад, в ту же самую счастливую ночь, Лемм, покойный Лемм, привел его в такой восторг. Потом Лаврецкий перешел в гостиную и долго не выходил из нее: в этой комнате, где он так часто видал Лизу, живее возникал перед ним ее образ; ему казалось, что он чувствовал вокруг себя следы ее присутствия; но грусть о ней была томительна и не легка: в ней не было тишины, навеваемой смертью. Лиза еще жила где-то, глухо, далеко; он думал о ней, как о живой, и не узнавал девушки, им некогда любимой, в том смутном, бледном призраке, облаченном в монашескую одежду, окруженном дымными волнами ладана. Лаврецкий сам бы себя не узнал, если б мог так взглянуть на себя, как он мысленно взглянул на Лизу. В течение этих восьми лет совершился, наконец, перелом в его жизни, тот перелом, которого многие не испытывают, но без которого нельзя остаться порядочным человеком до конца; он действительно перестал думать о собственном счастье, о своекорыстных целях. Он утих и – к чему таить правду? – постарел не одним лицом и телом, постарел душою; сохранить до старости сердце молодым, как говорят иные, и трудно и почти смешно; тот уже может быть доволен, кто не утратил веры в добро, постоянства воли, охоты к деятельности. Лаврецкий имел право быть довольным: он сделался действительно хорошим хозяином, действительно выучился пахать землю и трудился не для одного себя; он, насколько мог, обеспечил и упрочил быт своих крестьян.","But Lavretsky returned to the house, entered the dining room, approached the piano and touched one of the keys; a faint but clear sound rang out and secretly trembled in his heart: that note began that inspired melody with which, long ago, on that same happy night, Lemm, the late Lemm, had brought him such delight. Then Lavretsky went into the drawing room and did not leave it for a long time: in this room, where he had seen Liza so often, her image arose before him more vividly; it seemed to him that he felt traces of her presence around him; but her sadness was agonizing and not easy: there was no silence in her, cast by death. Liza still lived somewhere, deaf, far away; he thought of her as if she were alive, and did not recognize the girl he had once loved in that vague, pale ghost, dressed in monastic clothes, surrounded by smoky waves of incense. Lavretsky would not have recognized himself if he could look at himself the way he looked at Liza in his mind. During these eight years, finally, a turning point took place in his life, that turning point that many do not experience, but without which it is impossible to remain a decent person to the end; he really stopped thinking about his own happiness, about selfish goals. He calmed down and - why hide the truth? - has grown old not only in face and body, has grown old in soul; to keep the heart young until old age, as some say, and it is difficult and almost ridiculous; he can already be satisfied who has not lost faith in goodness, constancy of will, desire for activity. Lavretsky had the right to be satisfied: he became a really good farmer, really learned to plow the land, and did not work for himself alone; he, as far as he could, provided and strengthened the life of his peasants.","Lavretsky returned to the house, went into the dining-room, approached the piano and touched one of the keys. A faint but pure sound rang out and secretly reverberated in his heart: this was the note that began the inspired melody with which, long ago, on that happiest of nights, Lemm, the dead Lemm, had brought him to such a pitch of exultation. Then Lavretsky crossed into the drawing-room, and it was a long time before he left it: in this room, where he had seen Liza so frequently, her image rose more vividly before him; he seemed to feel traces of her presence around him; but his sadness for her was poignant and oppressive: there was none of the silence in it evocative of death. Liza still lived somewhere, shut away, far off; he tried to think of her as a living person and could not recognize the girl he had once loved in that blurred, pale ghost shrouded in her nun’s habit and surrounded by smoky waves of incense. Lavretsky would not even have been able to recognize himself, if he looked at himself as he mentally looked at Liza. In the course of these eight years the crisis had finally occurred in his life, that crisis which many never experience but without which it’s impossible to remain a decent man to the end; he had actually ceased to think about personal happiness, about venal ends. He had become tranquil and – what point is there in hiding the truth? – old, not in face and body alone, but in his soul as well; to keep the heart young into old age, as some claim they can, is difficult and almost comic; that man can be satisfied, who has not lost his faith in goodness, the constancy of the will, the desire to keep active. Lavretsky had a right to be satisfied: he had really made himself into a good proprietor, he had really learned how to plough the land, and he laboured not for himself alone; so far as was in his power, he tried to ensure and stabilize the livelihood of his peasants.","And Lavretsky went back into the house, went into the dining-room, drew near the piano and touched one of the keys; it gave out a faint but clear sound; on that note had begun the inspired melody with which long ago on that same happy night Lemm, the dead Lemm, had thrown him into such transports. Then Lavretsky went into the drawing-room, and for a long time he did not leave it; in that room where he had so often seen Lisa, her image rose most vividly before him; he seemed to feel the traces of her presence round him; but his grief for her was crushing, not easy to bear; it had none of the peace which comes with death. Lisa still lived somewhere, hidden and afar; he thought of her as of the living, but he did not recognize the girl he had once loved in that dim pale shadow, cloaked in a nun’s dress and encircled in misty clouds of incense. Lavretsky would not have recognized himself, could he have looked at himself, as mentally he looked at Lisa. In the course of these eight years he had passed that turning-point in life, which many never pass, but without which no one can be a good man to the end; he had really ceased to think of his own happiness, of his personal aims. He had grown calm, and—why hide the truth?—he had grown old not only in face and in body, he had grown old in heart; to keep a young heart up to old age, as some say, is not only difficult, but almost ridiculous; he may well be content who has not lost his belief in goodness, his steadfast will, and his zeal for work. Lavretsky had good reason to be content; he had become actually an excellent farmer, he had really learnt to cultivate the land, and his labours were not only for himself; he had, to the best of his powers, secured on a firm basis the welfare of his peasants."
– Как? Ведь вы его любите?,"- How? After all, you love him?",‘Why not? Surely you love him?’,"“How is that? Do you love him, then?”"
"– С нею в Лаврики? я? Не знаю, – промолвил он, погодя немного.","- With her in Lavriki? I? I don't know, he said after a while.","‘With her to Lavriki? I? I don’t know,’ he said after a pause.","“To Lavriky with her? I don’t know,” he said, after a moment’s hesitation."
– Вы? – проговорила она. – Вы здесь?,- You? she said. - Are you here?,‘You?’ she said. ’You here?’,“Is it you?” she said. “You here?”

"– Я развелся с женою, – проговорил с усилием Лаврецкий, – пожалуйста, не спрашивай о ней.","“I divorced my wife,” Lavretsky said with an effort, “please don’t ask about her.","‘I have divorced my wife,’ Lavretsky said with an effort. ‘Please do not ask about her.’","“I am separated from my wife,” Lavretsky answered with an effort, “please do not ask questions about her.”"

"Схоронив отца и поручив той же неизменной Глафире Петровне заведывание хозяйством и надзор за приказчиками, молодой Лаврецкий отправился в Москву, куда влекло его темное, но сильное чувство. Он сознавал недостатки своего воспитания и вознамерился по возможности воротить упущенное. В последние пять лет он много прочел и кое-что увидел; много мыслей перебродило в его голове; любой профессор позавидовал бы некоторым его познаниям, но в то же время он не знал многого, что каждому гимназисту давным-давно известно. Лаврецкий сознавал, что он не свободен; он втайне чувствовал себя чудаком. Недобрую шутку сыграл англоман с своим сыном; капризное воспитание принесло свои плоды. Долгие годы он безотчетно смирялся перед отцом своим; когда же, наконец, он разгадал его, дело уже было сделано, привычки вкоренились. Он не умел сходиться с людьми; двадцати трех лет от роду, с неукротимой жаждой любви в пристыженном сердце, он еще ни одной женщине не смел взглянуть в глаза. При его уме, ясном и здравом, но несколько тяжелом, при его наклонности к упрямству, созерцанию и лени ему бы следовало с ранних лет попасть в жизненный водоворот, а его продержали в искусственном уединении… И вот заколдованный круг расторгся, а он продолжал стоять на одном месте, замкнутый и сжатый в самом себе. Смешно было в его года надеть студентский мундир; но он не боялся насмешек: его спартанское воспитание хоть на то пригодилось, что развило в нем пренебрежение к чужим толкам, – и он надел, не смущаясь, студентский мундир. Он поступил в физико-математическое отделение. Здоровый, краснощекий, уже с заросшей бородой, молчаливый, он производил странное впечатление на своих товарищей; они и не подозревали того, что в этом суровом муже, аккуратно приезжавшем на лекции в широких деревенских санях парой, таился чуть не ребенок. Он им казался каким-то мудреным педантом, они в нем не нуждались и не искали в нем, он избегал их. В течение первых двух лет, проведенных им в университете, он сблизился только с одним студентом, у которого брал уроки в латинском языке. Студент этот, по имени МихалевиЧ, энтузиаст и стихотворец, искренно полюбил Лаврецкого и совершенно случайно стал виновником важной перемены в его судьбе.","After burying his father and entrusting the same unchanging Glafira Petrovna with managing the household and supervising the clerks, young Lavretsky went to Moscow, where a dark but strong feeling attracted him. He was aware of the shortcomings of his upbringing and set out to make up for what he had lost. In the last five years he has read a lot and seen something; many thoughts fermented in his head; any professor would envy some of his knowledge, but at the same time he did not know much that every high school student has known for a long time. Lavretsky realized that he was not free; he secretly felt like an oddball. The Angloman played a bad joke on his son; capricious upbringing has borne fruit. For many years he unconsciously humbled himself before his father; when, at last, he figured it out, the deed was already done, the habits had taken root. He did not know how to get along with people; twenty-three years old, with an indomitable thirst for love in his ashamed heart, he had not yet dared to look a single woman in the eye. With his mind, clear and sound, but somewhat heavy, with his tendency to stubbornness, contemplation and laziness, he should have fallen into the whirlpool of life from an early age, and he was kept in artificial seclusion ... And so the vicious circle was broken, and he continued to stand on one place, closed and compressed in itself. It was ridiculous at his age to put on a student's uniform; but he was not afraid of ridicule: his Spartan upbringing was at least useful in that it developed in him a contempt for other people's talk - and he put on, without embarrassment, a student's uniform. He entered the physics and mathematics department. Healthy, red-cheeked, already with an overgrown beard, silent, he made a strange impression on his comrades; they did not even suspect that in this stern husband, who carefully arrived at lectures in a wide village sleigh in pairs, almost a child hid. He seemed to them some kind of sophisticated pedant, they did not need him and did not look for him, he avoided them. During the first two years he spent at the university, he became close to only one student from whom he took lessons in Latin. This student, by the name of Mikhalevich, an enthusiast and a poet, sincerely fell in love with Lavretsky and, quite by chance, became the culprit of an important change in his fate.","HAVING buried his father and entrusted the running of the estate and supervision of the bailiffs to the immutable Glafira Petrovna, the young Lavretsky set off for Moscow, whither he was drawn by an obscure but strong feeling. He was conscious of deficiencies in his education and vowed to make good these deficiencies as far as possible. In the last five years he had read much and seen this and that; many ideas were fermenting in his brain; any professor would have envied him some of the things he knew, but at the same time he was ignorant of many things which every schoolboy had known for years. Lavretsky was conscious that he was not free; he secretly felt himself to be a curiosity. The Anglomaniac had played an unkind joke on his son; the capricious education brought forth its fruit. For many long years he had unaccountably humbled himself before his father and when he finally saw through him the deed was already done, the habits of his education had taken root. He had no idea how to get on with people; at twenty-three years of age, with an uncontrollable thirst for love welling up in his shame-stricken heart, he could still not bring himself to look a woman in the eyes. With his mind, so lucid and healthy, if a little pedestrian, with his tendency to stubbornness, introspection and indolence, he should have been cast into the whirlpool of life at an early age, but instead he had been kept in artificial isolation…. And yet now that the enchanted ring was broken he continued to stand in the same place, locked up and compressed within himself. At his age it was laughable to put on a student’s uniform, but he was not frightened of sniggers: his Spartan education at least had the merit of having bred in him an indifference to others’ opinions – and, without batting an eyelid, he dressed up in a student’s uniform. He entered the department of mathematics and physics. Healthy, ruddy-cheeked, with an already copious beard, taciturn in his ways, he produced a strange impression on his fellow-students, and they did not even suspect that in this stern-faced grown man, who arrived punctually at lectures in a broad country-style sledge drawn by a pair of horses, there lurked scarcely more than a child. He seemed to them to be some sort of screwball pedant; they had no need of him, sought nothing from him and he avoided them. During the course of his first two years at university he made friends with only one student, from whom he took Latin lessons. This student, by name Mikhalevich, endowed with enthusiasm and a talent for writing verses, grew sincerely fond of Lavretsky and quite by accident became guilty of causing an important change in his life.","After burying his father and intrusting to the unchanged Glafira Petrovna the management of his estate and superintendence of his bailiffs, young Lavretsky went to Moscow, whither he felt drawn by a vague but strong attraction. He recognised the defects of his education, and formed the resolution, as far as possible, to regain lost ground. In the last five years he had read much and seen something; he had many stray ideas in his head; any professor might have envied some of his acquirements, but at the same time he did not know much that every schoolboy would have learnt long ago. Lavretsky was aware of his limitations; he was secretly conscious of being eccentric. The Anglomaniac had done his son an ill turn; his whimsical education had produced its fruits. For long years he had submitted unquestioningly to his father; when at last he began to see through him, the evil was already done, his habits were deeply-rooted. He could not get on with people; at twenty-three years old, with an unquenchable thirst for love in his shy heart, he had never yet dared to look one woman in the face. With his intellect, clear and sound, but somewhat heavy, with his tendencies to obstinacy, contemplation, and indolence he ought from his earliest years to have been thrown into the stream of life, and he had been kept instead in artificial seclusion. And now the magic circle was broken, but he continued to remain within it, prisoned and pent up within himself. It was ridiculous at his age to put on a student’s dress, but he was not afraid of ridicule; his Spartan education had at least the good effect of developing in him a contempt for the opinion of others, and he put on, without embarrassment, the academical uniform. He entered the section of physics and mathematics. Robust, rosy-cheeked, bearded, and taciturn, he produced a strange impression on his companions; they did not suspect that this austere man, who came so punctually to the lectures in a wide village sledge with a pair of horses, was inwardly almost a child. He appeared to them to be a queer kind of pedant; they did not care for him, and made no overtures to him, and he avoided them. During the first two years he spent in the university, he only made acquaintance with one student, from whom he took lessons in Latin. This student Mihalevitch by name, an enthusiast and a poet, who loved Lavretsky sincerely, by chance became the means of bringing about an important change in his destiny."
"– Ничего? – воскликнула Марфа Тимофеевна, – это ты другим говори, а не мне! Ничего! А кто сейчас стоял на коленях? у кого ресницы еще мокры от слез? Ничего! Да ты посмотри на себя, что ты сделала с своим лицом, куда глаза свои девала? – Ничего! разве я не все знаю?","- Nothing? exclaimed Marfa Timofeevna, “you tell others, not me!” Nothing! And who was on his knees now? whose eyelashes are still wet with tears? Nothing! Yes, look at yourself, what did you do with your face, where did you put your eyes? - Nothing! don't I know everything?","‘It’s nothing…’ ‘Nothing?’ cried Marfa Timofeyevna. ‘You can say that to the others, but not to me! Nothing! Who’s just been kneeling? Whose eyelashes are still wet with tears? Nothing! Just you take a look at yourself – what’ve you done to your face, what’s happened to your eyes? Nothing! Do you think I don’t know everything?’","“Nothing!” cried Marfa Timofyevna; “you may tell that to others but not to me. Nothing, who was on her knees just to this minute? and whose eyelashes are still wet with tears? Nothing, indeed! why, look at yourself, what have you done with your face , what has become of your eyes?—Nothing! do you suppose I don’t know all?”"
"– Да, все второй нумер, легкий товар, спешная работа. Это нравится, и он нравится, и сам он этим доволен – ну и браво. А я не сержусь, эта кантата и я – мы оба старые дураки; мне немножко стыдно, но это ничего.","- Yes, all the second number, light goods, hasty work. He likes it, and he likes it, and he himself is pleased with it - well, bravo. And I'm not angry, this cantata and I are both old fools; I'm a little ashamed, but that's okay.","‘Yes, if it’s second-rate, lightweight stuff, all done in a hurry. What he does is liked and he’s liked and he’s pleased with himself – well, good luck to him! But I’m not annoyed; this cantata and I are both old fools. I’m a little ashamed, but it doesn’t matter.’","“Yes, everything second-rate, cheap, scamped work. That pleases, and he pleases, and he is glad it is so— and so much the better. I’m not angry; the cantata and I—we are a pair of old fools; I’m a little ashamed, but it’s no matter.”"

"– Я давно не играла, – возразила Варвара Павловна, немедленно садясь за фортепьяно, и бойко пробежала пальцами по клавишам. – Прикажете?","""I haven't played in a long time,"" objected Varvara Pavlovna, immediately sitting down at the piano and briskly running her fingers over the keys. - Will you tell me?","‘I haven’t played for a long time,’ Varvara Pavlovna responded, immediately seating herself at the piano, and she briskly ran her fingers over the keys. ‘Would you like me to?’","“It is long since I have played,” replied Varvara Pavlovna, seating herself without delay at the piano, and running her fingers smartly over the keys. “Do you wish it?”"
"– Мне ничего не нужно, – поспешно проговорил Лаврецкий.","""I don't need anything,"" Lavretsky said hastily.","‘I don’t need a thing,’ Lavretsky hastened to answer.","“I don’t want anything,” Lavretsky hastened to declare."
"– О-о, это вы недавно прочли? – спросил Лемм.","“Oh, did you read this recently?” Lemm asked.","‘O-oh, did you read this recently?’ asked Lemm.","“O—oh, did you read that lately?” asked Lemm."
"Лаврецкий не сразу понял, что такое он прочел; прочел во второй раз – и голова у него закружилась, пол заходил под ногами, как палуба корабля во время качки. Он и закричал, и задохнулся, и заплакал в одно мгновение.","Lavretsky did not immediately understand what he had read; he read it a second time and his head began to spin, the floor went under his feet like the deck of a ship during a rocking motion. He screamed, and choked, and cried in an instant.","Lavretsky did not immediately understand what he had read; he read it a second time – and his head began to spin, the floor began moving under his feet like the deck of a ship in a swell. He started crying out and sighing and weeping all at the same moment.","Lavretsky did not at once understand what he had read; he read it a second time, and his head began to swim, the ground began to sway under his feet like the deck of a ship in a rolling sea. He began to cry out and gasp and weep all at the same instant."
"Следующий день прошел довольно вяло. С утра падал дождь; Лемм глядел исподлобья и все крепче и крепче стискивал губы, точно он давал себе зарок никогда не открывать их. Ложась спать, Лаврецкий взял с собою на постель целую груду французских журналов, которые уже более двух недель лежали у него на столе нераспечатанные, Он принялся равнодушно рвать куверты и пробегать столбцы газет, в которых, впрочем, не было ничего нового. Он уже хотел бросить их – и вдруг вскочил с постели, как ужаленный. В фельетоне одной из газет известный уже нам мусье Жюль сообщал своим читателям «горестную новость»: прелестная, очаровательная москвитянка, – писал он, одна из цариц моды, украшение парижских салонов, madame de Lavretzki скончалась почти внезапно, – и весть эта, к сожалению, слишком верная, только что дошла до него, г-на Жюля. Он был, – так продолжал он, – можно сказать, другом покойницы…","The next day was rather slow. Rain fell in the morning; Lemm looked from under his brows and tightened his lips tighter and tighter, as if he had made a vow to himself never to open them. Going to bed, Lavretsky took with him to bed a whole heap of French magazines, which had been lying unopened on his desk for more than two weeks. He indifferently began to tear up the covers and run through the columns of newspapers, in which, however, there was nothing new. He already wanted to throw them - and suddenly jumped out of bed, as if stung. In a feuilleton of one of the newspapers, Monsieur Jules, already known to us, informed his readers of the “sorrowful news”: a lovely, charming Muscovite, - he wrote, one of the queens of fashion, an adornment of Parisian salons, madame de Lavretzki died almost suddenly, - and this news, unfortunately , too faithful, had just reached him, Monsieur Jules. He was,” he continued, “one might say, a friend of the deceased…","The next day passed fairly dully. From morning on there was rain; Lemm glared from beneath his brows and pursed his lips so tightly it was as if he had given himself a promise never to open them again. When he went to bed, Lavretsky took with him a whole heap of French journals which had been lying unopened on his desk for more than a fortnight. Disinterestedly he began ripping off the covers and glancing through the columns of newspapers in which, however, there was nothing new. He was about to cast them aside when he suddenly leapt up from the bed as though stung. In a report in one of the newspapers M. Jules, who is already familiar to us, informed his readers of ‘a sad piece of news’: that delightful, fascinating Moscow lady, he wrote, one of the queens of fashion and an adornment of the Paris salons, Madame de Lavretzki, had died most suddenly – and this news, regrettably all too true, had only just reached him, M. Jules. He was, he continued, a friend of the deceased, one might say…","The next day passed rather dully. Rain was falling from early morning; Lemm wore a scowl, and kept more and more tightly compressing his lips, as though he had taken an oath never to open them again. When he went to his room, Lavretsky took up to bed with him a whole bundle of French newspapers, which had been lying for more than fortnight on his table unopened. He began indifferently to tear open the wrappings, and glanced hastily over the columns of the newspapers—in which, however, there was nothing new. He was just about to throw them down—and all at once he leaped out of bed as if he had been stung. In an article in one of the papers, M. Jules, with whom we are already familiar, communicated to his readers a “mournful intelligence, that charming, fascinating Moscow lady,” he wrote, “one of the queens of fashion, who adorned Parisian salons, Madame de Lavretsky, had died almost suddenly, and this intelligence, unhappily only too well-founded, had only just reached him, M. Jules. He was,” so he continued, “he might say a friend of the deceased.”"
"– И ты пошла? Прекрасно. Да ты любишь его, что ли?","- And you went? Perfectly. Yes, you love him, don't you?","‘And you went? Marvellous. Are you in love with him, is that it?’","“And you went? A pretty thing! So you love him, eh?”"
"– Двадцати восьми лет – и самой счастливой наружности. Un jeune homme accompli[42], помилуйте.","“Twenty-eight years old—and the happiest of appearances. Un jeune homme accompli, have mercy.","‘Twenty-eight – and of most pleasant appearance. Un jeune homme accompli, believe me.’","“Twenty-eight, and of the most prepossessing appearance. Un jeune homme acompli, indeed.”"
– Не поэт и не музыкант! – прошептал он наконец… И усталая голова его тяжело опустилась на подушку.,- Not a poet and not a musician! he whispered at last... And his tired head sank heavily onto the pillow.,‘Not a poet and not a musician!’ he muttered finally. And his tired head dropped back heavily on to his pillow,“Neither poet nor musician!” he muttered at last... And his tired head sank wearily on to the pillows.
"– Это очень похвальные чувства, – возразила Марья Дмитриевна, – очень. Давно вы приехали? Видели вы его? Да сядьте же, пожалуйста.","“These are very commendable feelings,” objected Marya Dmitrievna, “very much. How long have you been here? Have you seen him? Yes, sit down, please.","‘Those are very praiseworthy feelings,’ responded Marya Dmitrievna, ‘very. Have you been here long? Have you seen him? Do sit down, please.’","“That is a very praiseworthy feeling” rejoined Marya Dmitrievna, “very. Have you been here long? Have you seen him? But sit down, please.”"
"– Без благодарности, прошу вас, эдак лучше, – поспешно проговорил Лаврецкий. – Стало быть, – продолжал он, приближаясь к двери, – я могу рассчитывать…","“Without gratitude, I beg you, it’s better that way,” Lavretsky said hastily. “So,” he went on, approaching the door, “I can count on—”","‘Without thanks, I beg you, that way it’s better,’ Lavretsky said hurriedly. ‘ So,’ he continued, going to the door, ‘I can count on…’","“No thanks, I beg—it is better without that,” Lavretsky said hurriedly. “So then,” he pursued, approaching the door, “I may reckon on—”"
"Варвара Павловна бросила на него дружелюбный взгляд и встала. Лиза вошла; – Марфа Тимофеевна напрасно ее удерживала: она решилась выдержать испытание до конца. Варвара Павловна пошла ей навстречу вместе с Паншиным, на лице которого появилось прежнее дипломатическое выражение.","Varvara Pavlovna cast a friendly glance at him and stood up. Lisa entered; - Marfa Timofeevna kept her in vain: she decided to endure the test to the end. Varvara Pavlovna went to meet her, accompanied by Panshin, on whose face the former diplomatic expression had reappeared.","Varvara Pavlovna threw him a friendly glance and rose. Liza came in; Marfa Timofeyevna had not succeeded in preventing her from coming down, and she was determined to endure her ordeal to the end. Varvara Pavlovna went to meet her together with Panshin, whose face wore his former diplomatic expression.","Varvara flung him a friendly glance and got up. Lisa came in: Marfa Timofyevna had tried in vain to hinder her; she was resolved to go through with her sufferings to the end. Varvara Pavlovna went to meet her together with Panshin, on whose face the former diplomatic expression had reappeared."
"Когда Лаврецкий вернулся домой, его встретил на пороге гостиной человек высокого роста и худой, в затасканном синем сюртуке, с морщинистым, но оживленным лицом, с растрепанными седыми бакенбардами, длинным прямым носом и небольшими воспаленными глазками. Это был Михалевич, бывший его товарищ по университету. Лаврецкий сперва не узнал его, но горячо его обнял, как только тот назвал себя. Они не виделись с Москвы. Посыпались восклицания, расспросы; выступили на свет божий давно заглохшие воспоминания. Торопливо выкуривая трубку за трубкой, отпивая по глотку чаю и размахивая длинными руками, Михалевич рассказал Лаврецкому свои похождения; в них не было ничего очень веселого, удачей в предприятиях своих он похвастаться не мог, – а он беспрестанно смеялся сиплым нервическим хохотом. Месяц тому назад получил он место в частной конторе богатого откупщика, верст за триста от города О…, и, узнав о возвращении Лаврецкого из-за границы, свернул с дороги, чтобы повидаться с старым приятелем. Михалевич говорил так же порывисто, как и в молодости, шумел и кипел по-прежнему. Лаврецкий упомянул было о своих обстоятельствах, но Михалевич перебил его, поспешно пробормотав: «Слышал, брат, слышал, – кто это мог ожидать?» – и тотчас перевел разговор в область общих рассуждений.","When Lavretsky returned home, he was met on the threshold of the drawing room by a tall and thin man, in a worn blue frock coat, with a wrinkled but lively face, with disheveled gray sideburns, a long straight nose and small inflamed eyes. It was Mikhalevich, his former university friend. Lavretsky did not recognize him at first, but embraced him warmly as soon as he identified himself. They have not seen each other since Moscow. Showered with exclamations, questions; Memories that had long since died out came to light. Hurriedly smoking pipe after pipe, drinking a sip of tea and waving his long arms, Mikhalevich told Lavretsky his adventures; there was nothing very cheerful about them, he could not boast of success in his undertakings - and he constantly laughed with hoarse nervous laughter. A month ago he got a job in the private office of a wealthy tax-farmer, three hundred miles from the city of O..., and, having learned of Lavretsky's return from abroad, he turned off the road to see an old friend. Mikhalevich spoke as impetuously as in his youth, noisy and seething as before. Lavretsky was about to mention his circumstances, but Mikhalevich interrupted him, hastily muttering: “I heard, brother, I heard—who could have expected that?” – and immediately turned the conversation into the realm of general reasoning.","WHEN Lavretsky returned home he was met on the threshold of the drawing-room by a tall, thin man in a worn blue coat, with a wrinkled but animated face, dishevelled grey side-whiskers, a long straight nose and small inflamed eyes. This was Mikhalevich, his former university comrade. Lavretsky did not recognize him at first, but embraced him warmly when the latter announced himself. They had not seen each other since their Moscow days. Exclamations and questions poured out; long dead memories broke into the light of day. Hurriedly smoking pipe after pipe, swallowing mouthfuls of tea and waving his long arms, Mikhalevich told Lavretsky of his adventures; there was nothing very gay about them, and he could not boast of success in what he had done – yet he ceaselessly laughed his hoarse, nervous laugh. A month ago he had obtained a position in the private office of a rich tax-farmer some two hundred miles from the town of O… and, having learned of Lavretsky’s return from abroad, had made a detour to see his old friend. Mikhalevich talked just as impulsively as he had done in his youth, with just as much sound and fury. Lavretsky was on the point of mentioning his circumstances, but Mikhalevich interrupted him by hurriedly muttering: ‘ I heard about it, my dear chap – who would’ve expected such a thing?’ – and at once directed the conversation to matters of general interest.","When Lavretsky reached home, he was met at the door of the drawing-room by a tall, thin man, in a thread-bare blue coat, with a wrinkled, but lively face, with disheveled grey whiskers, a long straight nose, and small fiery eyes. This was Mihalevitch, who had been his friend at the university. Lavretsky did not at first recognise him, but embraced him warmly directly he told his name. They had not met since their Moscow days. Torrents of exclamations and questions followed; long-buried recollections were brought to light. Hurriedly smoking pipe after pipe, tossing off tea at a gulp, and gesticulating with his long hands, Mihalevitch related his adventures to Lavretsky; there was nothing very inspiriting in them , he could not boast of success in his undertakings—but he was constantly laughing a hoarse, nervous laugh. A month previously he had received a position in the private counting-house of a spirit-tax contractor, two hundred and fifty miles from the town of O——-, and hearing of Lavretsky returned from abroad he had turned out of his way so as to see his old friend. Mihalevitch and talked as impetuously as in his youth; made as much noise and was as effervescent as of old. Lavretsky was about to acquaint him with his new position, but Mihalevitch interrupted him, muttering hurriedly, “I have heard, my dear fellow, I have heard—who could have anticipated it?” and at once turned the conversation upon general subjects."

"А Лемм долго сидел на своей кровати с нотной тетрадкой на коленях. Казалось, небывалая, сладкая мелодия собиралась посетить его: он уже горел и волновался, он чувствовал уже истому и сладость ее приближения… но он не дождался ее…","And Lemm sat for a long time on his bed with a music book on his knees. It seemed that an unprecedented, sweet melody was about to visit him: he was already on fire and agitated, he already felt the languor and sweetness of her approach ... but he did not wait for her ...","But Lemm sat for a long time on his bed with a music workbook on his knees.

He felt as though sweet, unheard melody was haunting him; already he was all aglow and astir, already he felt the languor and sweetness of its presence.. but he could not reach it."

"– Разве разочарованные такие бывают? – возражал Лаврецкий, – те все бывают бледные и больные – а хочешь, я тебя одной рукой подниму?",“Are there people who are disappointed?” objected Lavretsky;,"‘Is this how disillusioned people are?’ Lavretsky protested. ‘They’re usually pale and sickly, but if you like I’ll lift you up with one hand.’","“Are pessimists usually like this?” replied Lavretsky. “They are usually all pale and sickly—would you like me to lift you with one hand?” “Well, if you are not a pessimist you are a scepteec, that’s still worse.”"

"– Постойте, говорю вам, – перебил ее Лаврецкий. – Я соглашаюсь жить с вами, Варвара Павловна, – продолжал он, – то есть я вас привезу в Лаврики и проживу с вами, сколько сил хватит, а потом уеду – и буду наезжать. Вы видите, я вас обманывать не хочу, но не требуйте больше ничего. Вы бы сами рассмеялись, если бы я исполнил желание почтенной нашей родственницы и прижал бы вас к своему сердцу, стал бы уверять вас, что… что прошедшего не было, что срубленное дерево опять зацветет. Но я вижу: надо покориться. Вы это слово не так поймете… это все равно. Повторяю… я буду жить с вами… или нет, я этого обещать не могу… Я сойдусь с вами, буду вас снова считать моей женой…","""Wait a minute, I'm telling you,"" Lavretsky interrupted her. “I agree to live with you, Varvara Pavlovna,” he continued, “that is, I will bring you to Lavriki and live with you as long as I can, and then I’ll leave and I’ll run into you.

"– Я теперь нашел, как тебя назвать, – кричал тот же Михалевич в третьем часу ночи, – ты не скептик, не разочарованный, не вольтериянец, ты – байбак, и ты злостный байбак, байбак с сознаньем, не наивный бай бак. Наивные байбаки лежат себе на печи и ничего не делают, потому что не умеют ничего делать; они и не думают ничего, а ты мыслящий человек – и лежишь; ты мог бы что-нибудь делать – и ничего не делаешь; лежишь сытым брюхом кверху и говоришь: так оно и следует, лежать-то, потому что все, что люди ни делают, – все вздор и ни к чему не ведущая чепуха.","“Now I have found what to call you,” the same Mikhalevich shouted at three o’clock in the morning, “you are not a skeptic, not disappointed, not a Voltairian, you are a bastard, and you are a malicious bastard, a bastard with consciousness, not a naive bastard. Naive bobak lie on the stove and do nothing, because they don't know how to do anything; they do not think anything, and you are a thinking person - and lie down; you could do something and do nothing; you lie with your full belly up and say: this is how it should be, lie down, because everything people do is all nonsense and nonsense leading to nothing.","‘You’re not a sceptic, not disillusioned, not a Voltairean, you’re a layabout, a vicious layabout, consciously a layabout, not the naive type.

Simple loafers lie on the stove and do nothing because they don’t know how to do anything; they don’t think about anything either, but you are a man of ideas—and yet you lie on the stove ; you could do something—and you do nothing; you lie idle with a full stomach and look down from above and say, ‘It’s best to lie idle like this, because whatever people do, is all rubbish, leading to nothing.’”"

"– Правду говорят, – начала она, – что сердце людское исполнено противоречий. Ваш пример должен был испугать меня, сделать меня недоверчивой к бракам по любви, а я…","“They say the truth,” she began, “that the human heart is full of contradictions. Your example was supposed to frighten me, make me distrustful of love marriages, and I ...","‘They tell the truth,’ she began, ‘when they say the human heart is full of contradictions. Your example should frighten me, it should make me distrust love matches, but I…’","“They say truly,” she began, “that people’s hearts are full of contradictions. Your example ought to frighten me, to make me distrust marriage for love; but I—”"
"– Скажите, пожалуйста, – начал опять Лаврецкий, – мне Марья Дмитриевна сейчас говорила об этом… как, бишь, его?.. Паншине. Что это за господин?","“Tell me, please,” Lavretsky began again, “Marya Dmitrievna just told me about this ... how, I mean, him? .. Panshina. What is this sir?","‘Tell me, please,’ Lavretsky began again, ‘Marya Dmitrievna was talking to me just now about that – what’s his name? – Panshin. What sort of a man is he?’","“Tell me please,” began Lavretsky again, “Marya Dmitrievna has just been talking to me about this— what’s his name? Panshin. What sort of a man is he?”"
"– От нас, от нас, поверьте мне (он схватил ее за обе руки; Лиза побледнела и почти с испугом, но внимательно глядела на него), лишь бы мы не портили сами своей жизни. Для иных людей брак по любви может быть несчастьем; но не для вас, с вашим спокойным нравом, с вашей ясной душой! Умоляю вас, не выходите замуж без любви, по чувству долга, отреченья, что ли… Это то же безверие, тот же расчет – и еще худший. Поверьте мне – я имею право это говорить: я дорого заплатил за это право. И если ваш бог…","- From us, from us, believe me (he grabbed her by both hands; Liza turned pale and looked at him almost with fear, but attentively), if only we did not spoil our own lives. For some people, marriage for love can be a misfortune; but not for you, with your calm disposition, with your clear soul! I beg you, do not marry without love, out of a sense of duty, renunciation, or something ... This is the same unbelief, the same calculation - and even worse. Believe me - I have the right to say this: I paid dearly for this right. And if your god...","‘It depends on us and on you, believe me,’ (he seized both her hands in his; Liza grew pale and almost in fright, if attentively, gazed at him) ‘so long as we haven’t ourselves spoiled our lives. For some people a love-match can be a misfortune; but not for you, with your calm temperament and your lucid soul! I implore you, don’t get married without love, through a feeling of duty or renunciation or something of the kind…. That’s the same as lack of faith, the same as marrying for money and even worse. Believe me – I have a right to say this because I paid dearly for this right. And if your God…’","“On ourselves, ourselves, believe me” (he seized both her hands; Lisa grew pale and almost with terror but still steadfastly looked at him): “if only we do not ruin our lives. For some people marriage for love may be unhappiness; but not for you, with your calm temperament, and your clear soul; I beseech you, do not marry without love, from a sense of duty, self-sacrifice, or anything.... That is infidelity, that is mercenary, and worse still. Believe me,—I have the right to say so; I have paid dearly for the right. And if your God—.”"
– Кому меня прощать?,Who can forgive me?,‘Who’s going to forgive me?’,“To be forgiven by whom?”
"Тот продолжал моргать глазами и утираться. Лиза пришла в гостиную и села в угол; Лаврецкий посмотрел на нее, она на него посмотрела – и обоим стало почти жутко. Он прочел недоумение и какой-то тайный упрек на ее лице. Поговорить с нею, как бы ему хотелось, он не мог; оставаться в одной комнате с нею, гостем в числе других гостей, – было тяжело: он решился уйти. Прощаясь с нею, он успел повторить, что придет завтра, и прибавил, что надеется на ее дружбу.","He continued to blink his eyes and wipe himself. Lisa came into the drawing-room and sat down in a corner; Lavretsky looked at her, she looked at him, and both became almost terrified. He read the bewilderment and some secret reproach on her face. He could not talk to her as he would have liked; to remain in the same room with her, a guest among other guests, was hard: he decided to leave. Saying goodbye to her, he managed to repeat that he would come tomorrow, and added that he hoped for her friendship.","Gedeonovsky continued to blink his eyes and wipe his face. Liza came into the drawing-room and sat down in one corner; Lavretsky looked at her and she looked at him – and both experienced tremors of fright. He read perplexity and a kind of secret reproach on her face. No matter how much he wanted to, he could not speak to her; it was equally hard for him to remain in the same room with her as a guest among other guests: he decided to leave. Saying good-bye to her, he managed to repeat that he would call again tomorrow and added that he looked forward to her friendship.","The latter continued to blink and wipe his face. Lisa came into the drawing-room and sat down in a corner; Lavretsky looked at her, she looked at him, and both the felt the position insufferable. He read perplexity and a kind of secret reproachfulness in her face. He could not talk to her as he would have liked to do; to remain in the same room with her, a guest among other guests, was too painful; he decided to go away.

"До возвращения Ивана Петровича из-за границы Федя находился, как уже сказано, на руках Глафиры Петровны. Ему не было восьми лет, когда мать его скончалась; он видел ее не каждый день и полюбил ее страстно: память о ней, об ее тихом и бледном лице, об ее унылых взглядах и робких ласках навеки запечатлелась в его сердце; но он смутно понимал ее положение в доме; он чувствовал, что между им и ею существовала преграда, которую она не смела и не могла разрушить. Отца он дичился, да и сам Иван Петрович никогда не ласкал его; дедушка изредка гладил его по головке и допускал к руке, но называл его букой и считал дурачком. После смерти Маланьи Сергеевны тетка окончательно забрала его в руки. Федя боялся ее, боялся ее светлых и зорких глаз, ее резкого голоса; он не смел пикнуть при ней; бывало, он только что зашевелится на своем стуле, уж она и шипит: «Куда? Сиди смирно». По воскресеньям, после обедни, позволяли ему играть, то есть давали ему толстую книгу, таинственную книгу, сочинение некоего Максимовича-Амбодика, под заглавием «Символы и эмблемы». В этой книге помещалось около тысячи частью весьма загадочных рисунков, с столь же загадочными толкованиями на пяти языках. Купидон с голым и пухлым телом играл большую роль в этих рисунках. К одному из них, под названием «Шафран и радуга», относилось толкование: «Действие сего есть большее»; против другого, изображавшего «Цаплю, летящую с фиалковым цветком во рту», стояла надпись: «Тебе все они суть известны». «Купидон и медведь, лижущий своего медвежонка» означали: «Мало-помалу». Федя рассматривал эти рисунки; все были ему знакомы до малейших подробностей; некоторые, всегда одни и те же, заставляли его задумываться и будили его воображение; других развлечений он не знал. Когда наступила пора учить его языкам и музыке, Глафира Петровна наняла за бесценок старую девицу, шведку с заячьими глазами, которая с грехом пополам говорила по-французски и по-немецки, кое-как играла на фортепьяно да, сверх того, отлично солила огурцы. В обществе этой наставницы, тетки да старой сенной девушки Васильевны провел Федя целых четыре года. Бывало, сидит он в уголке с своими «Эмблемами» – сидит… сидит; в низкой комнате пахнет гораниумом, тускло горит одна сальная свечка, сверчок трещит однообразно, словно скучает, маленькие часы торопливо чикают на стене, мышь украдкой скребется и грызет за обоями, а три старые девы, словно парки, молча и быстро шевелят спицами, тени от рук их то бегают, то странно дрожат в полутьме, и странные, также полутемные мысли роятся в голове ребенка. Никто бы не назвал Федю интересным дитятей: он был довольно бледен, но толст, нескладно сложен и неловок, – настоящий мужик, по выражению Глафиры Петровны; бледность скоро бы исчезла с его лица, если б его почаще выпускали на воздух. Учился он порядочно, хотя часто ленился; он никогда не плакал; зато по временам находило на него дикое упрямство; тогда уже никто не мог с ним сладить. Федя не любил никого из окружавших его… Горе сердцу, не любившему смолоду!","Until Ivan Petrovich returned from abroad, Fedya was, as has already been said, in the arms of Glafira Petrovna. He was not eight years old when his mother died; he did not see her every day and fell in love with her passionately: the memory of her, of her quiet and pale face, of her dull looks and timid caresses, was forever imprinted in his heart; but he vaguely understood her position in the house; he felt that between him and her there was a barrier that she did not dare and could not destroy. He was shy of his father, and Ivan Petrovich himself never caressed him; grandfather occasionally patted him on the head and allowed him to touch his hand, but he called him a beech and considered him a fool. After the death of Malanya Sergeevna, his aunt finally took him into her hands. Fedya was afraid of her, afraid of her bright and keen eyes, her harsh voice; he did not dare to utter a word in front of her; it happened that he would just stir in his chair, and she would hiss: “Where to? Sit tight."" On Sundays, after mass, they let him play, that is, they gave him a thick book, a mysterious book, the work of a certain Maksimovich-Ambodik, under the title ""Symbols and Emblems."" This book contained about a thousand parts of very mysterious drawings, with equally mysterious interpretations in five languages. Cupid with a naked and plump body played a large role in these drawings. One of them, called ""Saffron and the Rainbow"", included the interpretation: ""This action is greater""; opposite another, depicting ""A heron flying with a violet flower in its mouth,"" was the inscription: ""They are all known to you."" ""Cupid and the bear licking his cub"" meant: ""Little by little."" Fedya examined these drawings; everyone was familiar to him down to the smallest detail; some, always the same, made him think and aroused his imagination; he knew no other entertainment. When the time came to teach him languages and music, Glafira Petrovna hired for nothing an old girl, a hare-eyed Swede, who spoke French and German with a sin in half, played the piano somehow and, moreover, perfectly salted cucumbers. Fedya spent four whole years in the company of this mentor, his aunt and the old hay girl Vasilievna. He used to sit in a corner with his ""Emblems"" - he sits ... he sits; in the low room it smells of goranium, a single tallow candle burns dimly, the cricket crackles monotonously, as if bored, a small clock chirps hastily on the wall, a mouse furtively scratches and gnaws behind the wallpaper, and three old maids, like parkas, silently and quickly move their knitting needles, shadows from their hands either run about or tremble strangely in the semi-darkness, and strange, also semi-dark thoughts swarm in the child's head. No one would have called Fedya an interesting child: he was rather pale, but fat, clumsily built and awkward - a real peasant, in the words of Glafira Petrovna; the pallor would soon disappear from his face if he were let out into the air more often. He studied decently, although he was often lazy; he never cried; but at times a wild stubbornness came over him; then no one could deal with him. Fedya did not love anyone around him ... Woe to the heart that did not love from a young age!","UNTIL Ivan Petrovich’s return from abroad Fedya, as has already been said, was in the hands of Glafira Petrovna. He was not yet eight years old when his mother died; he saw her infrequently and he loved her passionately: his recollection of her calm white face, her despondent eyes and timorous displays of fondness remained imprinted in his heart forever; but he had a vague awareness of her position in the house; he sensed that between him and her there existed a barrier which she neither dared to, nor could, break down. He avoided his father, and Ivan Petrovich for his part never showed him any affection; his grandfather occasionally stroked his head and allowed him to kiss his hand, but used to call him surly and considered him a fool. After Malanya Sergeyevna’s death his aunt finally got him into her hands. Fedya was frightened of her, frightened of her penetrating bright eyes and her sharp voice; he dared not open his mouth in her presence; if he so much as began to stir on his chair, she would hiss out: ‘Where are you off to? Sit still.’ On Sundays after dinner he was allowed to play, that is to say he was given a mysterious stout book, the work of a certain Maximovich-Ambodik, entitled Symbols and Emblems1. This book contained about a thousand partly very enigmatic drawings, with as many equally enigmatic descriptions in five languages. Cupid, with a naked, chubby body, played a great part in these drawings. To one of them, with the title ‘The Saffron Flower and the Rainbow’, was given the explanation: ‘The Effect of Ye Flower is Greater’; opposite another depicting ‘A Heron flying with a Violet in its Beak’ stood the inscription: ‘To Thee All Things Are Known’. ‘Cupid and a Bear licking her Young One’ signified: ‘ Little by Little’. Fedya used to study these drawings; they were all known to him down to the smallest details; some, always the same ones, made him stop to think and aroused his imagination; he knew no other pastimes. When the time came for him to be taught languages and music, Glafira Petrovna engaged for a pittance an elderly maiden lady, a Swede with darting eyes, who could just manage to speak French and German and played the piano so-so, but was above all excellent at pickling cucumbers. In the company of this instructress, his aunt and an old maid-servant, Vasilyevna, Fedya spent four whole years. There were times when he used to sit in a corner with his Emblems – and go on sitting there for hours at a time; the low-ceilinged room had a smell of geraniums, a single tallow candle burned faintly, a cricket sang monotonously, literally as if it were bored, a little clock ticked briskly on the wall, a mouse furtively scratched and gnawed behind the wallpaper, and the three old women, like the Parcae, would rapidly and soundlessly ply their needles, and the shadows from their hands would run up the walls or quiver strangely in the half-light of the room, and strange, similarly half-dark thoughts would swarm in the boy’s head. No one would have called Fedya an interesting child: he was fairly pale, but fat and of awkward and ungainly build – a real muzhik, in Glafira Petrovna’s words; the pallor would soon have vanished from his face if he had been sent out in the open air more often. He did his lessons well enough, although he was frequently lazy; he never cried; yet at times he would be possessed by a savage obstinacy and then no one could do anything with him. Fedya loved none of those around him…. Woe to the heart that has not loved in youth!","Until Ivan Petrovitch’s return from abroad, Fedya was, as already related, in the hands of Glafira Petrovna. He was not eight years old when his mother died; he did not see her every day, and loved her passionately; the memory of her, of her pale and gentle face, of her dejected looks and timid caresses, was imprinted on his heart for ever; but he vaguely understood her position in the house; he felt that between him and her there existed a barrier which she dared not and could not break down. He was shy of his father, and, indeed, Ivan Petrovitch on his side never caressed him; his grandfather sometimes patted him on the head and gave him his hand to kiss, but he thought him and called him a little fool. After the death of Malanya Sergyevna, his aunt finally got him under her control. Fedya was afraid of her: he was afraid of her bright sharp eyes and her harsh voice; he dared not utter a sound in her presence; often, when he only moved a little in his chair, she would! hiss out at once: “What are you doing? sit still.” On Sundays, after mass, he was allowed to play, that is to say, he was given a thick book, a mysterious book, the work of a certain Maimovitch-Ambodik, entitled “Symbols and Emblems.” This book was a medley of about a thousand mostly very enigmatical pictures, and as many enigmatical interpretations of them in five languages. Cupid—naked and very puffy in the body—played a leading part in these illustrations. In one of them, under the heading, “Saffron and the Rainbow,” the interpretation appended was: “Of this, the influence is vast;” opposite another, entitled “A heron, flying with a violet in his beak,” stood the inscription: “To thee they are all known.” “Cupid and the bear licking his fur” was inscribed, “Little by little.” Fedya used to ponder over these pictures; he knew them all to the minutest details; some of them, always the same ones, used to set him dreaming, and afforded him food for meditation; he! knew no other amusements. When the time came to teach him languages and music, Glafira Petrovna engaged, for next to nothing, an old maid, a Swede, with eyes like a hare’s, who spoke French and German with mistakes in every alternate word, played after a fashion on the piano, and above all, salted cucumbers to a perfection. In the society of this governess, his aunt, and the old servant maid, Vassilyevna, Fedya spent four whole years. Often he would sit in the corner with his “Emblems”; he sat there endlessly; there was a scent of geranium in the low pitched room, the solitary candle burnt dim, the cricket chirped monotonously, as though it were weary, the little clock ticked away hurriedly on the wall, a mouse scratched stealthily and gnawed at the wall-paper, and the three old women, like the Fates, swiftly and silently plied their knitting needles, the shadows raced after their hands and quivered strangely in the half darkness, and strange, half dark ideas swarmed in the child’s brain. No one would have called Fedya an interesting child; he was rather pale, but stout, clumsily built and awkward—a thorough peasant, as Glafira Petrovna said; the pallor would soon have vanished from his cheeks, if he had been allowed oftener to be in the open air. He learnt fairly quickly, though he was often lazy; he never cried, but at times he was overtaken by a fit of savage obstinacy; then no one could soften him. Fedya loved no one among those around him.... Woe to the heart that has not loved in youth!"
"Марья Дмитриевна попросила Паншина повторить романс; но он объявил, что не желает оскорблять ушей ученого немца, и предложил Лизе заняться бетговенскою сонатой. Тогда Марья Дмитриевна вздохнула и, с своей стороны, предложила Гедеоновскому пройтись с ней по саду. «Мне хочется, – сказала она, – еще поговорить и посоветоваться с вами о бедном нашем Феде». Гедеоновский осклабился, поклонился, взял двумя пальцами свою шляпу с аккуратно положенными на одном из ее полей перчатками и удалился вместе с Марьей Дмитриевной. В комнате остались Паншин и Лиза; она достала и раскрыла сонату; оба молча сели за фортепьяно. Сверху доносились слабые звуки гамм, разыгрываемых неверными пальчиками Леночки.","Marya Dmitrievna asked Panshin to repeat the romance; but he announced that he did not wish to offend the ears of the learned German, and suggested to Lisa that she study the Beethoven sonata. Then Marya Dmitrievna sighed and, for her part, invited Gedeonovsky to walk with her in the garden. “I want,” she said, “to talk and consult with you about our poor Fed.” Gedeonovsky grinned, bowed, took his hat with two fingers, with gloves neatly placed on one of its brim, and withdrew with Marya Dmitrievna. Panshin and Liza remained in the room; she took out and opened the sonata; both sat silently at the piano. From above came the faint sounds of scales being played by Lenochka's unsteady fingers.","Marya Dmitrievna asked Panshin to repeat his romance, but he announced that he had no wish to offend the ears of the learned German and suggested to Liza that they should practise the Beethoven Sonata. Then Marya Dmitrievna sighed and suggested for her own part that Gedeonovsky should accompany her for a walk in the garden. ‘I wish’, she said, ‘to have a few more words with you about our poor Fedya and to seek your advice.’ Gedeonovsky grinned, bowed, picked up his hat with two fingers at the point where his gloves had been neatly laid on its brim and departed with Marya Dmitrievna. Panshin and Liza remained in the room; she drew out and opened the Sonata; both of them sat down silently at the piano. From above resounded the faint sounds of scales played over and over by Lenochka’s unskilled fingers.","Marya Dmitrievna asked Panshin to sing his song again; but he protested that he did not wish to torture the ears of the musical German, and suggested to Lisa that they should attack Beethoven’s sonata. Then Marya Dmitrievna heaved a sigh, and in her turn suggested to Gedeonovsky a walk in the garden. “I should like,” she said, “to have a little more talk, and to consult you about our poor Fedya.” Gedeonovsky bowed with a smirk, and with two fingers picked up his hat, on the brim of which his gloves had been tidily laid, and went away with Marya Dmitrievna. Panshin and Lisa remained alone in the room; she fetched the sonata, and opened it; both seated themselves at the piano in silence. Overhead were heard the faint sounds of scales, played by the uncertain fingers of Lenotchka."

"«Вот я и дома, вот я и вернулся», – подумал Лаврецкий, входя в крошечную переднюю, между тем как ставни со стуком и визгом отворялись один за другим и дневной свет проникал в опустелые покои.","“Here I am at home, here I am back,” thought Lavretsky, as he entered the tiny ante-room, while the shutters banged and screeched open one after the other, and daylight penetrated the empty chambers.","‘Here I am at home, here I am back at last,’ thought Lavretsky, entering the tiny hall as the shutters were opened one after another with a clattering and a creaking and daylight penetrated into the desolate rooms.","“So here I am at home, here I am back again,” thought Lavretsky, as he walked into the diminutive passage, while one after another the shutters were being opened with much creaking and knocking, and the light of day poured into the deserted rooms."
"– С черной лилией, во всяком случае, – заметил Лаврецкий.","""With a black lily, anyway,"" observed Lavretsky.","‘A black lily, in any case,’ remarked Lavretsky.","“A black lily, any way,” observed Lavretsky."
"– Видно, в карты играть, – говорила она, – не то, что выдумки сочинять.","“It seems like playing cards,” she said, “is not like making up stories.","‘Evidently playing cards’, she said, ‘is not the same as telling stories.’","“Car-playing, you see,” she said, “is not so easy as talking scandal.”"
"А между тем внизу, в гостиной, шел преферанс; Марья Дмитриевна выиграла и была в духе. Человек вошел и доложил о приезде Паншина.","Meanwhile, downstairs, in the living room, there was a preference; Marya Dmitrievna won and was in good spirits. The man came in and announced Panshin's arrival.","MEANWHILE below, in the drawing-room, the game of preference was continuing; Marya Dmitrievna was winning and in high spirits. A footman entered and announced the arrival of Panshin.","Meanwhile, down-stairs, preference was going on merrily in the drawing-room; Marya Dmitrievna was winning, and was in high good-humour. A servant came in and announced that Panshin was below."
"Прошло восемь лет. Опять настала весна… Но скажем прежде несколько слов о судьбе Михалевича, Паншина, г-жи Лаврецкой – и расстанемся с ними. Михалевич, после долгих странствований, попал, наконец, на настоящее свое дело: он получил место старшего надзирателя в казенном заведении. Он очень доволен своей судьбой, и воспитанники его «обожают», хотя и передразнивают его. Паншин сильно подвинулся в чинах и метит уже в директоры; ходит несколько согнувшись: должно быть, Владимирский крест, пожалованный ему на шею, оттягивает его вперед. Чиновник в нем взял решительный перевес над художником; его все еще моложавое лицо пожелтело, волосы поредели, и он уже не поет, не рисует, но втайне занимается литературой: написал комедийку, вроде «пословиц», и так как теперь все пишущие непременно «выводят» кого-нибудь или что-нибудь, то и он вывел в ней кокетку и читает ее исподтишка двум-трем благоволящим к нему дамам. В брак он, однако, не вступил, хотя много представлялось к тому прекрасных случаев: в этом виновата Варвара Павловна. Что касается до нее, то она по-прежнему постоянно живет в Париже: Федор Иваныч дал ей на себя вексель и откупился от нее, от возможности вторичного неожиданного наезда. Она постарела и потолстела, но все еще мила и изящна. У каждого человека есть свой идеал: Варвара Павловна нашла свой – в драматических произведениях г-на Дюма-сына. Она прилежно посещает театр, где выводятся на сцену чахоточные и чувствительные камелии; быть г-жою Дош кажется ей верхом человеческого благополучия: она однажды объявила, что не желает для своей дочери лучшей участи. Должно надеяться, что судьба избавит mademoiselle Ada от подобного благополучия: из румяного, пухлого ребенка она превратилась в слабогрудую, бледненькую девочку; нервы ее уже расстроены. Число поклонников Варвары Павловны уменьшилось, но они не перевелись; некоторых она, вероятно, сохранит до конца своей жизни. Самым рьяным из них в последнее время был некто Закурдало-Скубырников, из отставных гвардейских усоносов, человек лет тридцати восьми, необыкновенной, крепости сложения. Французские посетители салона г-жи Лаврецкой называют его «le gros taureau de l'Ukraine»[59]; Варвара Павловна никогда не приглашает его на свои модные вечера, но он пользуется ее благорасположением вполне.","Eight years have passed. Spring has come again... But first, let us say a few words about the fate of Mikhalevich, Panshin, Ms. Lavretskaya, and let us part with them. Mikhalevich, after long wanderings, finally got to his real job: he got a position as a senior warden in a government institution. He is very pleased with his fate, and his pupils ""adore"" him, although they mimic him. Panshin has advanced a lot in ranks and is already aiming for directors; walks somewhat bent over: it must be the Vladimir Cross, bestowed on his neck, that pulls him forward. The official in him took a decisive advantage over the artist; his still youthful face has turned yellow, his hair has thinned, and he no longer sings, no longer draws, but is secretly engaged in literature: he wrote a comedy, like ""proverbs"", and since now all writers invariably ""bring out"" someone or something, then he also brought out a coquette in it and reads it on the sly to two or three ladies favoring him. However, he did not enter into marriage, although there were many excellent cases for this: Varvara Pavlovna was to blame for this. As for her, she still lives permanently in Paris: Fyodor Ivanovich gave her a bill for himself and paid off her, from the possibility of a second unexpected arrival. She is older and fatter, but still sweet and graceful. Each person has his own ideal: Varvara Pavlovna found her own - in the dramatic works of Mr. Dumas son. She diligently visits the theater, where consumptive and sensitive camellias are brought on stage; to be Mrs. Dosh seems to her the height of human well-being: she once announced that she did not want a better fate for her daughter. It must be hoped that fate will save mademoiselle Ada from such well-being: from a ruddy, plump child, she turned into a weak-breasted, pale girl; her nerves are already shattered. The number of Varvara Pavlovna's admirers has decreased, but they have not died out; some she will probably keep for the rest of her life. The most zealous of them lately was a certain Zakurdalo-Skubyrnikov, one of the retired guards, a man of about thirty-eight, with an unusually strong build. French visitors to Madame Lavretskaya's salon call it ""le gros taureau de l'Ukraine""[59]; Varvara Pavlovna never invites him to her fashionable evenings, but he enjoys her full favor.","EIGHT years passed. Spring had come again.… But before going any further we will say a few words about the fate of Mikhalevich, and of Panshin, and of Madame Lavretsky – and say good-bye to them. Mikhalevich, after prolonged wandering, has finally discovered his true vocation: he has obtained the post of senior superintendent in a government institute. He is very satisfied with his lot, and his pupils ‘adore’ him, although they make fun of him behind his back. Panshin has made good progress in the bureaucratic hierarchy and is already aiming to become a departmental director; he walks about slightly bent; perhaps the Cross of St Vladimir, which he wears round his neck, weighs him down. The official in him has achieved decisive ascendancy over the artist; his still young-looking face has a jaundiced complexion, his hair has thinned, and he neither sings nor draws any more, but secretly dabbles in literature : he has written a little comedy piece, a kind of theatrical ‘proverb’, and since nowadays all who write invariably ‘take off’ someone or something, so he has portrayed a coquette in it and he reads it to two or three well-wishing ladies of his acquaintance. He has not embarked on marriage, although many excellent opportunities have arisen; for that Varvara Pavlovna is to blame. So far as she is concerned, she resides permanently in Paris as she did before: Fyodor Ivanych has allocated her a fixed sum of money and thus bought himself freedom from the possibility of her landing on him unexpectedly a second time. She has grown older and stouter, but she is still charming and elegant. Everyone has an ideal: Varvara Pavlovna has found hers – in the dramatic works of Dumas fils. She assiduously visits the theatre, where consumptive and highly strung dames aux camélias are presented on the stage; to be Madame Doche1 seems to her the summit of human bliss. She once declared that she could not wish a better fate for her daughter. It must be hoped that fate will preserve Mademoiselle Ada from such bliss: from a red-cheeked, plump child she has been turned into a weak-chested, pale little girl; she already has bad nerves. Varvara Pavlovna’s admirers have diminished, but not disappeared; she will retain some, probably, until the end of her life. The most ardent of them recently has been a certain Zakurdalo-Skubyrnikov, a moustachioed retired guardsman, of about thirty-eight years of age and unusually powerful physique. French visitors at Madame Lavretsky ’s salon call him ‘le gros taureau de l’Ukraine’; Varvara Pavlovna never invites him to her fashionable evenings, but he enjoys her fullest benevolence.","Eight years had passed by. Once more the spring had come.... But we will say a few words first of the fate of Mihalevitch, Panshin, and Madame Laverestky—and then take leave of them. Mihalevitch, after long wanderings, has at last fallen in with exactly the right work for him; he has received the position of senior superintendent of a government school. He is very well content with his lot; his pupils adore him, though they mimick him too. Panshin has gained great advancement in rank, and already has a directorship in view; he walks with a slight stoop, caused doubtless by the weight round his neck of the Vladimir cross which has been conferred on him. The official in him has finally gained the ascendency over the artist; his still youngish face has grown yellow, and his hair scanty; he now neither sings nor sketches, but applies himself in secret to literature; he has written a comedy, in the style of a “proverb,” and as nowadays all writers have to draw a portrait of some one or something, he has drawn in it the portrait of a coquette, and he reads it privately to two or three ladies who look kindly upon him. He has, however, not entered upon matrimony, though many excellent opportunities of doing so have presented themselves. For this Varvara Pavlovna was responsible. As for her, she lives constantly at Paris, as in former days. Fedor Ivanitch has given her a promissory note for a large sum, and has so secured immunity from the possibility of her making a second sudden descent upon him. She has grown older and stouter, but is still charming and elegant. Every one has his ideal. Varvara Pavlovna found hers in the dramatic works of M. Dumas Fils. She diligently frequents the theatres, when consumptive and sentimental “dames aux camelias” are brought on the stage; to be Madame Doche seems to her the height of human bliss; she once declared that she did not desire a better fate for her own daughter. It is to be hoped that fate will spare Mademoiselle Ada from such happiness; from a rosy-cheeked, chubby child she has turned into a weak-chested, pale girl; her nerves are already deranged. The number of Varvara Pavlovna adorers has diminished, but she still has some; a few she will probably retain to the end of her days. The most ardent of them in these later days is a certain Zakurdalo-Skubrinikov, a retired guardsman, a full-bearded man of thirty-eight, of exceptionally vigorous physique. The French habitues of Madame Lavretsky’s salon call him “le gros taureau de l’Ukraine;” Varvara Pavlovna never invites him to her fashionable evening reunions, but he is in the fullest enjoyment of her favours."
"– Да, прошло, тетушка, если вы только захотите мне помочь, – произнесла с внезапным одушевлением Лиза и бросилась на шею Марфе Тимофеевне. – Милая тетушка, будьте мне другом, помогите мне, не сердитесь, поймите меня…","“Yes, it’s over, auntie, if you only want to help me,” Liza said with sudden animation and flung herself on Marfa Timofyevna’s neck. - Dear aunt, be my friend, help me, do not be angry, understand me ...","‘Yes, it’s all over, auntie, if only you’ll be willing to help me,’ Liza announced with sudden animation and flung herself on Marfa Timofeyevna’s neck. ‘Dearest auntie, be my friend, help me, don’t be angry, try to understand me…’","“Yes, it is over, auntie, if you will only try to help me,” Lisa declared with sudden animation, and she flung herself on Marfa Timofyevna’s neck. “Dar auntie, be a friend to me, help me, don’t be angry, understand me”..."
– И принесете мне ответ?,"""And bring me an answer?""",‘And you’ll bring me back an answer?’,“And you will bring me an answer?”
"– Матушка будет очень рада, – возразила Лиза, – она слышала о вашем приезде.","“Mother will be very glad,” Lisa objected, “she heard about your arrival.","‘Mother will be very glad,’ Liza replied. ‘She’s heard about your arrival.’","“Mamma will be glad to see you,” replied Lisa; “she had heard of your arrival.”"
"– Ан нет, – ты одна пойдешь: обленилась я, мать моя, – возразила Марфа Тимофеевна, – чаем уж очень себя балую. – Она говорила Настасье Карповне «ты», хотя и жила с ней на ровной ноге – недаром же она была Пестова: трое Пестовых значатся в синодике Ивана Васильевича Грозного; Марфа Тимофеевна это знала.","“But no, you’ll go alone: I’m lazy, my mother,” objected Marfa Timofeevna, “I spoil myself with tea very much. - She said to Nastasya Karpovna “you”, although she lived with her on an even footing - it was not without reason that she was Pestova: three Pestovs appear in the synodics of Ivan Vasilyevich the Terrible; Marfa Timofeevna knew this.","‘No, I shan’t – you go by yourself. I’m feeling lazy, my dear,’ replied Marfa Timofeyevna, ‘and I’ve been letting myself drink too much tea.’ She addressed Nastasya Karpovna with the familiar ‘thou’ even though she lived with her on an equal footing. She wasn’t a Pestov for nothing: three of them had been put to death by Ivan the Terrible1; Marfa Timofeyevna knew that only too well.","“No, not at all; you will go alone; I have grown too lazy, my dear,” relied Marfa Timofyevna. “Already I am indulging myself with tea.” She addressed Nastasya Karpovna in the singular, though she treated her as an equal. She was not a Pestov for nothing: three Pestovs had been on the death-list of Ivan the Terrible, Marfa Timofyevna was well aware of the fact."

"Лиза вошла в теткину комнату и в изнеможении опустилась на стул. Марфа Тимофеевна долго молча смотрела на нее, тихонько стала перед нею на колени – и начала, все так же молча, целовать попеременно ее руки. Лиза подалась вперед, покраснела – и заплакала, но не подняла Марфы Тимофеевны, не отняла своих рук: она чувствовала, что не имела права отнять их, не имела права помешать старушке выразить свое раскаяние, участие, испросить у ней прощение за вчерашнее; и Марфа Тимофеевна не могла нацеловаться этих бедных, бледных, бессильных рук – и безмолвные слезы лились из ее глаз и глаз Лизы; а кот Матрос мурлыкал в широких креслах возле клубка с чулком, продолговатое пламя лампадки чуть-чуть трогалось и шевелилось перед иконой; в соседней комнатке, за дверью, стояла Настасья Карповна и тоже украдкой утирала себе глаза свернутым в клубочек клетчатым носовым платком.","Liza entered her aunt's room and sank into a chair in exhaustion. Marfa Timofeyevna looked at her for a long time in silence, quietly knelt before her, and began, still silently, kissing her hands alternately. Liza leaned forward, blushed, and wept, but she did not raise Marfa Timofeevna, she did not take her hands away: she felt that she had no right to take them away, had no right to prevent the old woman from expressing her repentance, sympathy, from asking her for forgiveness for yesterday; and Marfa Timofyevna could not kiss those poor, pale, powerless hands—and silent tears flowed from her eyes and those of Liza; and the cat Sailor purred in the wide armchairs near the ball with the stocking, the oblong flame of the lamp slightly touched and stirred in front of the icon; in the next room, behind the door, stood Nastasya Karpovna, also stealthily wiping her eyes with a checkered handkerchief folded into a ball.","Liza entered her aunt’s room and sank exhausted into a chair. Marfa Timofeyevna gave her a long, silent look and quietly kneeled down before her – and began, silently as ever, to kiss each of her hands in turn. Liza leaned forward, reddened – and burst into tears, but did not make Marfa Timofeyevna rise and did not withdraw her hands: she felt she had no right to withdraw them, had no right to prevent the old woman from expressing her repentance and concern and asking forgiveness for what happened yesterday; and Marfa Timofeyevna could not have enough of kissing the poor, pale powerless hands – and noiseless tears flowed from her eyes and from Liza’s; and Sailor, the cat, purred next to a ball of wool in the wide armchair, and the long, long flame of the lamp made a slight flickering and wavered before the icon; in the little neighbouring room, behind the door, stood Nastasya Karpovna and also furtively wiped her eyes with a checked handkerchief compressed into a little ball.","Lisa went into her aunt’s room, and sank powerless into a chair. Marfa Timofyevna gazed long at her in silence, slowly she knelt down before her—and began still in the same silence to kiss her hands alternately. Lisa bent forward, crimsoning—and began to weep, but she did not make Marfa Timofyevna get up, she did not take away her hands, she felt that she had not the right to take them away, that she had not the right to hinder the old lady from expressing her penitence, and her sympathy, from begging forgiveness for what had passed the day before. And Marfa Timofyevna could not kiss enough those poor, pale, powerless hands, and silent tears flowed from her eyes and from Lisa’s; while the cat Matross purred in the wide arm-chair among the knitting wool, and the long flame of the little lamp faintly stirred and flickered before the holy picture. In the next room, behind the door, stood Nastasya Karpovna, and she too was furtively wiping her eyes with her check pocket-handkerchief rolled up in a ball."
"– Но вы меня любите, Лиза? Мы будем счастливы?","“But do you love me, Lisa?” We will be happy?","‘But you love me, Liza? We’ll be happy, won’t we?’","“But you love me, Lisa? We shall be happy.”"
"Варвара Павловна постояла некоторое время на месте, слегка повела плечами, отнесла девочку в другую комнату, раздела и уложила ее. Потом она достала книжку, села у лампы, подождала около часу и, наконец, сама легла в постель.","Varvara Pavlovna stood still for some time, shrugged her shoulders slightly, carried the girl into another room, undressed her, and put her to bed. Then she took out a book, sat down by the lamp, waited about an hour, and finally got into bed herself.","Varvara Pavlovna stood for a while where she was, gave a slight shrug of the shoulders, carried the little girl into the other room, undressed her and put her to bed.

"Лиза пошла в другую комнату за альбомом, а Паншин, оставшись один, достал из кармана батистовый платок, потер себе ногти и посмотрел, как-то сносясь, на свои руки. Они у него были очень красивы и белы; на большом пальце левой руки носил он винтообразное золотое кольцо. Лиза вернулась; Паншин уселся к окну, развернул альбом.","Liza went into another room to fetch an album, and Panshin, left alone, took a cambric handkerchief out of his pocket, rubbed his nails, and looked, somehow derisively, at his hands. They were very beautiful and white; on the thumb of his left hand he wore a helical gold ring. Lisa is back; Panshin sat down by the window and opened the album.","Liza went into the next room to find her album while Panshin, left alone, drew a cambric handkerchief out of his pocket, rubbed his nails and scrutinized his hands.

"– Дайте же ей по крайней мере на том руку, – промолвила Марья Дмитриевна, у которой давно высохли слезы.","“Give her a hand, at least,” said Marya Dmitrievna, whose tears had long since dried up.","‘At least give her your hand on that,’ said Marya Dmitrievna, whose tears had long since dried up.","“Give her, at least your hand on it,” observed Marya Dmitrievna, whose tears had long since dried up."
"Старик покраснел до ушей, бросил косвенный взгляд на Лизу и торопливо вышел из комнаты.","The old man blushed to the ears, cast an indirect glance at Liza, and hurried out of the room.","The old man crimsoned to the roots of his hair, threw an oblique glance at Liza and hurriedly left the room.","The old man crimsoned to his ears, and with a sidelong look at Lisa, he hurriedly went out of the room."
"– Вот как мы должны были увидеться, – проговорил он наконец. Лиза приняла руки от лица.","“This is how we were supposed to meet,” he finally said. Lisa took her hands away from her face.","‘So this is how we had to see each other,’ he said at last. Liza took her hands from her face.",“This is how we were to meet again!” he brought out at last. Lisa took her hands from her face.
"– Кто же без греха, тетушка? Эта слабость в нем есть, конечно. Сергей Петрович воспитания, конечно, не получил, по-французски не говорит; но он, воля ваша, приятный человек.","- Who is without sin, auntie? It has this weakness, of course. Sergei Petrovich, of course, did not receive an upbringing, he does not speak French; but he, your will, is a pleasant man.","‘Who is faultless, aunt dear? Of course he has this weakness. Sergey Petrovich hasn’t, of course, received a proper education and cannot speak French. But no matter what you say, he is an agreeable man.’","“Every one has faults, auntie; that is his weak point, no doubt. Sergei Petrovitch has had no education: of course he does not speak French, still, say what you like, he is an agreeable man.”"
"– Мне кажется, – говорила Лиза несколько мгновений спустя, – если бы он точно меня любил, он бы не написал этого письма; он должен был бы чувствовать, что я не могу отвечать ему теперь.","“It seems to me,” Lisa said a few moments later, “if he definitely loved me, he would not have written this letter; he would have to feel that I can't answer him now.","‘It seems to me’, Liza said a few moments later, ‘that if he really loved me, he wouldn’t have written me that letter; he should have felt that I couldn’t answer him now.’","“It seems to me,” said Lisa a few moments later, “that if he had really loved me, he would not have written that letter; he must have felt that I could not give him an answer now.”"
"– Маэстро! – сказал, между прочим, Лаврецкий, – вам придется скоро сочинять торжественную кантату.","- Maestro! - said Lavretsky, among other things, - you will soon have to compose a solemn cantata.","‘Maestro!’ said Lavretsky during the course of their talk, ‘you’ll soon have to compose a triumphal cantata.’","“Master!” said Lavretsky among other things, “you will soon have to compose a triumphal cantata.”"

"Таким-то нашел его Иван Петрович и, не теряя времени, принялся применять к нему свою систему. «Я из него хочу сделать человека прежде всего, un homme, – сказал он Глафире Петровне, – и не только человека, но спартанца». Исполнение своего намерения Иван Петрович начал с того, что одел сына по-шотландски: двенадцатилетний малый стал ходить с обнаженными икрами и с петушьим пером на окладном картузе; шведку заменил молодой швейцарец, изучивший гимнастику до совершенства; музыку, как занятие недостойное мужчины, изгнали навсегда; естественные науки, международное право, математика, столярное ремесло, по совету Жан-Жака Руссо, и геральдика, для поддержания рыцарских чувств, – вот чем должен был заниматься будущий «человек»; его будили в четыре часа утра, тотчас окачивали холодною водой и заставляли бегать вокруг высокого столба на веревке; ел он раз в день по одному блюду, ездил верхом, стрелял из арбалета; при всяком удобном случае упражнялся, по примеру родителя, в твердости воли и каждый вечер вносил в особую книгу отчет прошедшего дня и свои впечатления; а Иван Петрович, с своей стороны, писал ему наставления по-французски, в которых он называл его mon fils[11] и говорил ему vous[12]. По-русски Федя говорил отцу: «ты», но в его присутствии не смел садиться. «Система» сбила с толку мальчика, поселила путаницу в его голове, притиснула ее; но зато на его здоровье новый образ жизни благодетельно подействовал: сначала он схватил горячку, но вскоре оправился и стал молодцом. Отец гордился им и называл его на своем странном наречии: сын натуры, произведение мое. Когда Феде минул шестнадцатый год, Иван Петрович почел за долг заблаговременно поселить в него презрение к женскому полу, – и молодой спартанец, с робостью на душе, с первым пухом на губах, полный соков, сил и крови, уже старался казаться равнодушным, холодным и грубым.","That is how Ivan Petrovich found him and, without wasting time, began to apply his system to him. “I want to make a man out of him, first of all, un homme,” he said to Glafira Petrovna, “and not only a man, but a Spartan.” Ivan Petrovich began the fulfillment of his intention by dressing his son in Scottish fashion: the twelve-year-old fellow began to walk with bare calves and with a rooster feather on his cap; the Swede was replaced by a young Swiss who had studied gymnastics to perfection; music, as an occupation unworthy of a man, was banished forever; natural sciences, international law, mathematics, carpentry, on the advice of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and heraldry, to maintain chivalrous feelings - that was what the future ""man"" had to do; he was awakened at four o'clock in the morning, immediately doused with cold water and forced to run around a high post on a rope; he ate one dish once a day, rode on horseback, shot from a crossbow; at every opportunity, he exercised, following the example of a parent, in firmness of will and every evening he entered into a special book an account of the past day and his impressions; and Ivan Petrovich, for his part, wrote instructions to him in French, in which he called him mon fils[11] and said to him vous[12]. In Russian, Fedya said to his father: “you,” but in his presence he did not dare to sit down. The ""system"" confused the boy, planted confusion in his head, squeezed it; but on the other hand, the new way of life had a beneficial effect on his health: at first he caught a fever, but soon recovered and became a fine fellow. My father was proud of him and called him in his strange dialect: the son of nature, my work. When Fedya was in his sixteenth year, Ivan Petrovich considered it his duty to instill in him contempt for the female sex in advance - and the young Spartan, with timidity in his soul, with the first fluff on his lips, full of juices, strength and blood, was already trying to seem indifferent, cold and rough.","This is how Ivan Petrovich found him and, wasting no time, he set about applying his system to him. ‘ Above all I want to make a man of him, un homme,’ he told Glafira Petrovna, ‘and not only a man, but a Spartan.’ Ivan Petrovich began putting his intention into effect by dressing his son in a Scottish outfit: the twelve-year-old lad began to go about with bare legs and a cock’s feather in his bonnet; the Swedish lady was replaced by a young Swiss who had studied gymnastics to perfection; music, as an occupation unworthy of a man, was banished altogether; the natural sciences, international law, mathematics, carpentry, as Jean-Jacques Rousseau had advised, and heraldry for the cultivation of chivalrous feelings – these were what the ‘man-to-be’ had to concern himself with; he was woken at four o’clock in the morning, at once doused with cold water and made to run round a high pole on a string; he ate one meal a day consisting of one dish, rode on horseback and shot from a cross-bow; at every suitable opportunity he would give himself lessons in strength of will, on the example of his parent, and each evening he would enter in a special book an account of the past day and his impressions; while Ivan Petrovich, for his part, would write him edifying dithyrambs in French in which he called him mon fils and addressed him as vous. Fedya addressed his father in Russian with the familiar ‘thou’, but never dared to sit down in his presence. The ‘system’ bemused the boy, sowed confusion in his head and cramped his mind; but, despite this, the new way of life had a beneficial effect on his health: at first he caught a fever, but he quickly recovered and became a sturdy youngster. His father was proud of him and described him in his strange manner of speaking as ‘a son of nature, all my own work’. When Fedya was sixteen, Ivan Petrovich considered it his duty, in good time, to instil in him a contempt for the female sex – and the young Spartan, timid at heart, with the first down on his cheeks, full of sap, strength and new blood, made an attempt to appear indifferent, cold and rude.","Thus Ivan Petrovitch found him, and without loss of time he set to work to apply his system to him. “I want above all to make a man, un homme, of him,” he said to Glafira Petrovna, “and not only a man, but a Spartan.” Ivan Petrovitch began carrying out his intentions by putting his son in a Scotch kilt; the twelve-year-old boy had to go about with bare knees and a plume stuck in his Scotch cap. The Swedish lady was replaced by a young Swiss tutor, who was versed in gymnastics to perfection. Music, as a pursuit unworthy of a man, was discarded. The natural sciences, international law, mathematics, carpentry, after Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s precept, and heraldry, to encourage chivalrous feelings, were what the future “man” was to be occupied with. He was waked at four o’clock in the morning, splashed at once with cold water and set to running round a high pole with a cord; he had only one meal a day, consisting of a single dish; rode on horseback; shot with a cross-bow; at every convenient opportunity he was exercised in acquiring after his parent’s example firmness of will, and every evening he inscribed in a special book an account of the day and his impressions; and Ivan Petrovitch on his side wrote him instructions in French in which he called him mon fils, and addressed him as vous. In Russian Fedya called his father thou, but did not dare to sit down in his presence. The “system” dazed the boy, confused and cramped his intellect, but his health on the other hand was benefited by the new manner of his life; at first he fell into a fever but soon recovered and began to grow stout and strong. His father was proud of him and called him in his strange jargon “a child of nature, my creation.” When Fedya had reached his sixteenth year, Ivan Petrovitch thought it his duty in good time to instil into him a contempt for the female sex; and the young Spartan, with timidity in his heart and the first down on his lip, full of sap and strength and young blood, already tried to seem indifferent, cold, and rude."
"– Не уходите после урока, Христофор Федорыч, – сказал он, – мы с Лизаветой Михайловной сыграем бетговенскую сонату в четыре руки.","“Don’t leave after the lesson, Christopher Fedoritch,” he said, “Lizaveta Mikhailovna and I will play the Beethoven sonata in four hands.”","‘Don’t go away after the lesson, Christopher Fyodorych,’ he said. ‘Lizaveta Mikhaylovna and I will be playing Beethoven’s Sonata for four hands.’","“Don’t go after the lesson, Christopher Fedoritch,” he said. “Lisa Mihalovna and I are going to play a duet of Beethoven’s sonata.”"
"– Ничего, – возразил он, – мне очень хорошо; я рад за вас, я рад вас видеть; продолжайте.","“Nothing,” he objected, “I feel very good; I'm glad for you, I'm glad to see you; go on.","‘Nothing,’ he replied, ‘I feel very happy. I’m glad for you and glad to see you. Please go on playing.’","“Nothing,” he replied; “I’m very happy; I’m glad of you, I’m glad to see you—go on.”"

"– Послушайте, сударыня, – начал он наконец, тяжело дыша и по временам стискивая зубы, – нам нечего притворяться друг перед другом; я вашему раскаянию не верю; да если бы оно и было искренно, сойтись снова с вами, жить с вами – мне невозможно.","“Listen, madam,” he began at last, breathing heavily and at times gritting his teeth, “we have nothing to pretend to each other; I do not believe your repentance; Yes, even if it were sincere, it would be impossible for me to get back together with you, to live with you.","‘Please listen, madam,’ he began at last, breathing heavily and from time to time clenching his teeth. ‘We have no need to pretend to each other; I don’t believe in your repentance; and even if it were sincere, to go back to you again, to live with you – that is impossible for me.’","“Listen, madam,” he began at last, breathing with difficulty and at moments setting his teeth: “it is useless for us to make pretense with one another; I don’t believe in your penitence; and even if it were sincere, to be with you again, to live with you, would be impossible for me.”"
"– Веселее, ничего-с, – возразил Гедеоновский шепотом.","“More fun, nothing, sir,” objected Gedeonovsky in a whisper.","‘Indeed he’s well and happy,’ answered Gedeonovsky in a whisper.","“Yes, he was well and cheerful,” replied Gedeonovsky in a whisper."
– Уж не собираетесь ли вы выйти за Паншина? – спросил он. Лиза чуть заметно улыбнулась.,"""Are you going to marry Panshin?"" - he asked. Lisa smiled slightly.",‘You’re not thinking of marrying Panshin?’ he asked. Liza gave a barely discernible smile.,“You cannot be making up your mind to marry Panshin?” he said. Lisa gave an almost imperceptible smile.
"– Вы правы, Лизавета Михайяовна, – промолвил он. – Всему виною – моя вечная необдуманность. Нет, не возражайте мне; я себя хорошо знаю. Много зла мне наделала моя необдуманность. По ее милости я прослыл за эгоиста.","“You are right, Lizaveta Mikhailovna,” he said. - All the fault - my eternal thoughtlessness. No, don't mind me; I know myself well. My thoughtlessness did me a lot of harm. By her grace, I was known as an egoist.","‘You’re right , Lizaveta Mikhaylovna,’ he said. ‘What’s to blame is my eternal lack of forethought. No, don’t contradict me – I know myself only too well. My lack of forethought has done me great harm. Through it I’ve gained a reputation for being an egoist.’","“You are right, Lisaveta Mihalovna,” he declared. “It’s my everlasting thoughtlessness that’s to blame. No, don’t contradict me; I know myself. So much harm has come to me from my want of thought. It’s owing to that failing that I am thought to be an egoist.”"
"– Нет, душа моя, это не смелость, это расчет. Да господь с ней! Ты ее, говорят, в Лаврики посылаешь, правда?","- No, my soul, this is not courage, this is calculation. God be with her! They say you send her to Lavriki, don't you?","‘No, my dear fellow, this isn’t boldness, this is calculation. And God be with her! They say you’re packing her off to Lavriki, is that true?’","“No, my darling, it’s not effrontery, it’s calculation, God forgive her! They say you are sending her off to Lavriky; is it true?”"
"– Браво! – воскликнула Марья Дмитриевна, – а теперь слезьте и придите к нам.","– Bravo! exclaimed Marya Dmitrievna, “now get off and come to us.”",‘Bravo!’ exclaimed Marya Dmitrievna. ‘Now get down and come in and see us.’,"“Bravo!” cried Marya Dmitrievna, “but now get off and come in to us.”"
– А Федора Ивановича ты забыла? – заметил ее брат. – Или ты себя не считаешь? Леночка слегка покраснела.,- Have you forgotten Fyodor Ivanovich? her brother noticed. Or do you not consider yourself? Lenochka blushed slightly.,‘Have you forgotten Fyodor Ivanych?’ her brother asked. ‘Or aren’t you counting yourself?’ Lenochka blushed slightly.,"“Have you forgotten Fedor Ivanitch?” replied her brother,... “or didn’t you count yourself?” Lenotchka blushed slightly."

"Этого было слишком даже для Паншина: он замялся – и замял разговор. Он попытался перевести его на красоту звездного неба, на музыку Шуберта – все как-то не клеилось; он кончил тем, что предложил Марье Дмитриевне сыграть с ней в пикет. «Как! в такой вечер?» – слабо возразила она; однако велела принести карты.","This was too much even for Panshin: he hesitated - and hushed up the conversation. He tried to translate it into the beauty of the starry sky, to the music of Schubert - everything somehow did not stick together; he ended by suggesting that Marya Dmitrievna play picket with her. ""How! on an evening like this?"" she objected weakly; However, she ordered to bring cards.","This was too much for Panshin; he stopped short – and curtailed the conversation. He attempted to redirect the talk to the beauties of the starlit sky and the music of Schubert – all to no avail; he ended by suggesting that Marya Dmitrievna should play picquet. ‘What!

"– Шурочка, – воскликнула вдруг Марфа Тимофеевна, – поди-ка скажи Лизавете Михайловне – то есть, нет, спроси у ней… ведь она внизу?","“Shurochka,” Marfa Timofeevna suddenly exclaimed, “go and tell Lizaveta Mikhailovna—that is, no, ask her… she’s downstairs, isn’t she?”","‘Shurochka,’ cried Marfa Timofeyevna suddenly, ‘go and tell Lizaveta Mikhaylovna – that’s to say, no, ask her…. She’s downstairs, isn’t she?’ ‘Yes, she is.’","“Shurotchka!” cried Marfa Timofyevna suddenly, “run and tell Lisaveta Mihalovna,—at least, no, ask her... is she down-stairs?”"
"– Да, он мне нравится; он, кажется, хороший человек.","– Yes, I like him; he seems to be a good person.","‘Yes, I like him; he seems to be a nice person.’","“Yes, I like him; he seems a nice man.”"
"– Ни минуты отдыха, ни секунды! – возражал с повелительным движением руки Михалевич. – Ни одной секунды! Смерть не ждет, и жизнь ждать не должна.","Not a minute of rest, not a second! - Mikhalevich objected with an imperious movement of his hand. - Not one second! Death does not wait, and life should not wait.","‘Not a minute’s rest, not a second’s!’ protested Mikhalevich with an authoritarian wave of the hand. ‘Not a single second’s! Death doesn’t wait, and life shouldn’t be allowed to.’","“Not a minute, nor a second!” retorted Mihalevitch with an imperious wave of the hand. “Not one second: death does not delay, and life ought not to delay.”"
"Лиза накануне написала Лаврецкому, чтобы он явился к ним вечером; но он сперва отправился к себе на квартиру. Он не застал дома ни жены, ни дочери; от людей он узнал, что она отправилась с ней к Калитиным. Это известие и поразило его и взбесило. «Видно, Варвара Павловна решилась не давать мне жить», – подумал он с волнением злобы на сердце. Он начал ходить взад и вперед, беспрестанно отталкивая ногами и руками попадавшиеся ему детские игрушки, книжки, разные женские принадлежности; он позвал Жюстину и велел ей убрать весь этот «хлам». «Oui, monsieur»[57], – сказала она с ужимкой и начала прибирать комнату, грациозно наклоняясь и каждым своим движением давая Лаврецкому чувствовать, что она считает его за необтесанного медведя. С ненавистью смотрел он на ее истасканное, но все еще «пикантное», насмешливое, парижское лицо, на ее белые нарукавнички, шелковый фартук и легкий чепчик. Он услал ее, наконец, и после долгих колебаний (Варвара Павловна все не возвращалась) решился отправиться к Калягиным, – не к Марье Дмитриевне (он бы ни за что не вошел в ее гостиную, в ту гостиную, где находилась его жена), но к Марфе Тимофеевне; он вспомнил, что задняя лестница с девичьего крыльца вела прямо к ней. Лаврецкий так и сделал. Случай помог ему: он на дворе встретил Шурочку; она провела его к Марфе Тимофеевне. Он застал ее, против ее обыкновения, одну; она сидела в уголку, простоволосая, сгорбленная, с скрещенными на груди руками. Увидев Лаврецкого, старушка очень всполошилась, проворно встала и начала ходить туда и сюда по комнате, как будто отыскивая свой чепец.","Liza had written to Lavretsky the day before, asking him to come to them in the evening; but he first went to his apartment. He found neither his wife nor his daughter at home; from people he learned that she went with her to the Kalitins. This news shocked and enraged him. “It is obvious that Varvara Pavlovna has made up her mind not to let me live,” he thought with an emotion of malice in his heart. He began to walk back and forth, constantly pushing away with his feet and hands the children's toys, books, and various women's belongings that came across to him; he called Justine and told her to clean up all this ""junk"". “Oui, monsieur,”[57] she said with an air of slyness, and began to tidy up the room, stooping gracefully and with every movement making Lavretsky feel that she considered him to be a rough bear. He looked with hatred at her worn, but still ""piquant"", mocking, Parisian face, at her white armlets, silk apron and light cap. He finally sent her away, and after long hesitation (Varvara Pavlovna still did not return) decided to go to the Kalyagins, not to Marya Dmitrievna (he would never have entered her drawing room, the drawing room where his wife was), but to Marfa Timofeevna; he remembered that the back stairs from the girl's porch led straight up to her. Lavretsky did just that. Chance helped him: he met Shurochka in the yard; she led him to Marfa Timofeevna. He found her, contrary to her custom, alone; she was sitting in a corner, bare-haired, hunched over, with her arms folded across her chest. Seeing Lavretsky, the old woman became very alarmed, got up nimbly and began to pace up and down the room, as if looking for her cap.","THE previous day Liza had written to Lavretsky, asking him to come that evening; but he went first to his own apartments. He found neither his wife, nor his daughter, at home; from the servants he learned that she had taken his daughter to the Kalitins. This news both amazed and infuriated him. ‘Obviously Varvara Pavlovna has decided to leave me nothing to live for,’ he thought with an access of malice in his heart. He began to walk backwards and forwards, ceaselessly kicking and casting aside the children’s toys, books and various female belongings that got in his way; he summoned Justine and ordered her to clear away all this ‘trash’. Oui, monsieur,’ she said, making a face, and proceeded to tidy the room, bending elegantly and giving Lavretsky to understand with every movement that she considered him an uneducated bear of a man. He looked with loathing at her raddled but still ‘piquant’, supercilious Parisian face, at her white cuffs, silk pinafore and little cap. He dismissed her eventually, and after much hesitation (Varvara Pavlovna had still not returned) made up his mind to go to the Kalitins – not to Marya Dmitrievna (nothing on earth would have made him enter her drawing-room, the drawing-room where his wife was), but to Marfa Timofeyevna; he remembered that a back staircase from the servants’ entrance led directly to her room. This is what Lavretsky did. He was helped by circumstances: Shurochka was in the courtyard and took him to Marfa Timofeyevna. He found her, contrary to custom, alone; she was sitting in a corner, bent, capless and with her arms folded. Seeing Lavretsky, the old lady got in a tizzy, jumped to her feet and began walking to and fro about the room as if looking for her cap.","Lisa had written to Lavretsky the day before, to tell him to come in the evening; but he first went home to his lodgings. He found neither his wife nor his daughter at home; from the servants he learned that she had gone with the child to the Kalitins’. This information astounded and maddened him. “Varvara Pavlovna has made up her mind not to let me live at all, it seems,” he thought with a passion of hatred in his heart. He began to walk up and down, and his hands and feet were constantly knocking up against child’s toys, books and feminine belongings; he called Justine and told her to clear away all this “litter.” “Oui, monsieur,” she said with a grimace, and began to set the room in order, stooping gracefully, and letting Lavretsky feel in every movement that she regarded him as an unpolished bear. He looked with aversion at her faded, but still “piquante,” ironical, Parisian face, at her white elbow-sleeves, her silk apron, and little light cap. He sent her away at last, and after long hesitation (as Varvara Pavlovna still did not return) he decided to go to the Kalitins’—not to see Marya Dmitrievna (he would not for anything in the world have gone into that drawing-room, the room where his wife was), but to go up to Marfa Timofyevna’s. He remembered that the back staircase from the servants’ entrance led straight to her apartment. He acted on this plan; fortune favoured him; he met Shurotchka in the court-yard; she conducted him up to Marfa Timofyevna’s. He found her, contrary to her usual habit, alone; she was sitting without a cap in a corner, bent, and her arms crossed over her breast. The old lady was much upset on seeing Lavretsky, she got up quickly and began to move to and fro in the room as if she were looking for her cap."
"Между тем время шло да шло. Иван Петрович большую часть года проводил в Лавриках (так называлось главное его родовое имение), а по зимам приезжал в Москву один, останавливался в трактире, прилежно посещал клуб, ораторствовал и развивал свои планы в гостиных и более чем когда-либо держался англоманом, брюзгой и государственным человеком. Но настал 1825 год и много принес с собою горя. Близкие знакомые и приятели Ивана Петровича подверглись тяжким испытаниям. Иван Петрович поспешил удалиться в деревню и заперся в своем доме. Прошел еще год, и Иван Петрович вдруг захилел, ослабел, опустился; здоровье ему изменило. Вольнодумец – начал ходить в церковь и заказывать молебны; европеец – стал париться в бане, обедать в два часа, ложиться в девять, засыпать под болтовню старого дворецкого; государственный человек – сжег все свои планы, всю переписку, трепетал перед губернатором и егозил перед исправником; человек с закаленною волей – хныкал и жаловался, когда у него вскакивал веред, когда ему подавали тарелку холодного супу. Глафира Петровна опять завладела всем в доме; опять начали ходить с заднего крыльца приказчики, бурмистры, простые мужики к «старой колотовке», – так прозывали ее дворовые люди. Перемена в Иване Петровиче сильно поразила его сына; ему уже пошел девятнадцатый год, и он начинал размышлять и высвобождаться из-под гнета давившей его руки. Он и прежде замечал разладицу между словами и делами отца, между его широкими либеральными теориями и черствым, мелким деспотизмом; но он не ожидал такого крутого перелома. Застарелый эгоист вдруг выказался весь. Молодой Лаврецкий собирался ехать в Москву, подготовиться в университет, – неожиданное, новое бедствие обрушилось на голову Ивана Петровича: он ослеп, и ослеп безнадежно, в один день.","Meanwhile, time went on and on. Ivan Petrovich spent most of the year in Lavriky (that was the name of his main family estate), and in the winter he came to Moscow alone, stayed in a tavern, diligently visited the club, orated and developed his plans in the drawing rooms and, more than ever, behaved like an Anglo-lover, a grump. and statesman. But the year 1825 came and brought with it a lot of grief. Close acquaintances and friends of Ivan Petrovich were subjected to severe trials. Ivan Petrovich hurried to retire to the village and locked himself in his house. Another year passed, and Ivan Petrovich suddenly became ill, weakened, sank; his health changed. Freethinker - began to go to church and order prayers; a European - began to bathe in a bathhouse, have dinner at two o'clock, go to bed at nine, fall asleep to the chatter of an old butler; a statesman - he burned all his plans, all correspondence, trembled before the governor and fussed before the police chief; a man with a tempered will - whimpered and complained when he jumped up in a fever when he was served a bowl of cold soup. Glafira Petrovna again took possession of everything in the house; clerks, bailiffs, and simple peasants again began to walk from the back porch to the “old beater,” as the courtyard people called it. The change in Ivan Petrovich greatly struck his son; he was already in his nineteenth year, and he was beginning to meditate and free himself from the yoke of the hand that was crushing him. He had previously noticed the discord between the words and deeds of his father, between his broad liberal theories and callous, petty despotism; but he did not expect such a sharp turn. The old egoist suddenly showed himself all. Young Lavretsky was about to go to Moscow, to prepare for the university, - an unexpected, new disaster fell on the head of Ivan Petrovich: he went blind, and hopelessly blind, in one day.","Meanwhile, time was relentlessly passing. Ivan Petrovich was used to spending a great part of each year in Lavriki (such was the name of his main estate), but in the winters he went off alone to Moscow, put up in an inn, assiduously visited his club, dilated oratorically on his plans in drawing-rooms and behaved more than ever like an Anglomaniac and querulous elder statesman. Then came the year 18252 and brought much grief with it. Close acquaintances and friends of Ivan Petrovich underwent painful ordeals. Ivan Petrovich hurriedly withdrew to the country and locked himself in his house. Another year passed and Ivan Petrovich suddenly went into a decline, grew weak and poorly; his health played traitor to him. The freethinker began to go to church and order prayers to be said; the European began taking steam baths, dining at two o’clock, going to bed at nine and falling asleep to the old steward’s chatter; the elder statesman burned all his plans and correspondence, trembled before the governor and fawned before the district police officer; the man of tempered will whimpered and groaned when a boil erupted on his skin or he was served a bowl of cold soup. Glafira Petrovna once again took charge of everything in the house; once again stewards, bailiffs and simple peasants began to frequent the back door to see ‘the browbeating old bitch’, as the house-serfs called her. The change in Ivan Petrovich had a powerful effect on his son; he was already nineteen and beginning to think for himself and break free of the oppressive authority wielded by his father’s hand. He had previously noticed the discrepancy between his father’s words and his deeds, between his broad liberal theories and crusty, petty despotism; but he had not expected such a sharp about-turn. The chronic egoist now revealed himself in his true colours. The young Lavretsky was about to go off to Moscow to prepare for the university when a new and unexpected misfortune broke over Ivan Petrovich’s head: he went blind, hopelessly blind, in the course of a single day.","Meanwhile time was passing. Ivan Petrovitch spent the great part of the year in Lavriky (that was the name of the principal estate inherited from his ancestors). But in the winter he used to go to Moscow alone; there he stayed at a tavern, diligently visited the club, made speeches and developed his plans in drawing-rooms, and in his behaviour was more than ever Anglomaniac, grumbling and political. But the year 1825 came and brought much sorrow. Intimate friends and acquaintances of Ivan Petrovitch underwent painful experiences. Ivan Petrovitch made haste to withdraw into the country and shut himself up in his house. Another year passed by, and suddenly Ivan Petrovitch grew feeble, and ailing; his health began to break up. He, the free-thinker, began to go to church and have prayers put up for him; he, the European, began to sit in steam-baths, to dine at two o’clock, to go to bed at nine, and to doze off to the sound of the chatter of the old steward; he, the man of! political ideas, burnt all his schemes, all his correspondence, trembled before the governor, and was uneasy at the sigh of the police-captain; he, the man of iron will, whimpered and complained, when he had a gumboil or when they gave him a plate of cold soup. Glafira Petrovna again took control of everything in the house; once more the overseers, bailiffs and simple peasants began to come to the back stairs to speak to the “old witch,” as the servants called her. The change in Ivan Petrovitch produced a powerful impression on his son. He had now reached his nineteenth year, and had begun to reflect and to emancipate himself from the hand that pressed like a weight upon him. Even before this time he had observed a little discrepancy between his father’s words and deeds, between his wide liberal theories and his harsh petty despotism; but he had not expected such a complete breakdown. His confirmed egoism was patent now in everything. Young Lavretsky was getting ready! to go to Moscow, to prepare for the university, when a new unexpected calamity overtook Ivan Petrovitch; he became blind, and hopelessly blind, in one day."
"– Постойте, – неожиданно крикнул ей вслед Лаврецкий. – У меня есть до вашей матушки и до вас великая просьба: посетите меня на моем новоселье. Вы знаете, я завел фортепьяно; Лемм гостит у меня; сирень теперь цветет; вы подышите деревенским воздухом и можете вернуться в тот же день, – согласны вы?","“Wait a minute,” Lavretsky suddenly called after her. - I have before your mother and before you a great request: visit me at my housewarming party. You know, I started the piano; Lemme is visiting me; the lilac is now blooming; you will breathe the country air and you can return the same day, do you agree?","‘Wait a minute,’ Lavretsky unexpectedly called after her. ‘I have a great favour to ask you and your mother. Visit me for my house-warming. You know I’ve had a piano installed; Lemm is staying with me; the lilac is now in bloom; you can have a breath of country air and return the same day – do you agree?’","“Stop a minute,” Lavretsky cried after her unexpectedly. “I have a great favour to beg of your mother and you; to pay me a visit in my new abode. You know, I have had a piano sent over; Lemm is staying with me; the lilac is in flower now; you will get a breath of country air, and you can return the same day— will you consent?”"
"– Зови ее Лизой, отец мой, что за Михайловна она для тебя? Да сиди смирно, а то ты Шурочкин стул сломаешь.","- Call her Liza, my father, what kind of Mikhailovna is she to you? Yes, sit still, otherwise you will break Shurochka's chair.","‘Call her Liza, there’s a good chap; since when is she Mikhaylovna to you? And do sit quietly, otherwise you’ll break Shurochka’s chair.’","“Call her Lisa, my dear fellow. Mihalovna indeed to you! But sit still, or you will break Shurotchka’s little chair.”"
"– А! Н-у, что ж – прекрасно. Леночка, ступай наверх с господином Леммом. Старик пошел было вслед за девочкой, но Паншин остановил его.","- BUT! Wow, that's great. Lenochka, go upstairs with Mr. Lemm. The old man started to follow the girl, but Panshin stopped him.","‘Ah! Well, that’s splendid. Lenochka, go upstairs with Mr Lemm.’ The old man was about to follow the little girl out of the room, but Panshin stopped him.","“Oh! very well. Lenotchka, go up-stairs with Mr. Lemm.” The old man was about to follow the little girl, but Panshin stopped him."
"Особенно доставалось Глафире Петровне; он решительно не мог обойтись без нее – и она до конца исполняла все прихоти больного, хотя иногда не тотчас решалась отвечать ему, чтобы звуком голоса не выдать душившей ее злобы. Так проскрипел он еще два года и умер в первых числах мая, вынесенный на балкон, на солнце. «Глаша, Глашка! бульонцу, бульонцу, старая дур…», – пролепетал его коснеющий язык и, не договорив последнего слова, умолк навеки. Глафира Петровна, которая только что выхватила чашку бульону из рук дворецкого, остановилась, посмотрела брату в лицо, медленно, широко перекрестилась и удалилась молча; а тут же находившийся сын тоже ничего не сказал, оперся на перила балкона и долго глядел в сад, весь благовонный и зеленый, весь блестевший в лучах золотого весеннего солнца. Ему было двадцать три года; как страшно, как незаметно скоро пронеслись эти двадцать три года!.. Жизнь открывалась перед ним.","Glafira Petrovna especially got it; he absolutely could not do without her - and she to the end fulfilled all the whims of the patient, although sometimes she did not immediately dare to answer him, so as not to betray the anger that was choking her by the sound of her voice. So he creaked for another two years and died in the first days of May, carried out on the balcony, in the sun. ""Glasha, Glashka! bouillon, bouillon, you old fool…” his stagnant tongue murmured and, without finishing the last word, fell silent forever. Glafira Petrovna, who had just snatched a cup of broth from the butler's hands, stopped, looked her brother in the face, crossed herself slowly, widely, and walked away in silence; and the son who was right there said nothing either, leaned on the railing of the balcony and looked for a long time into the garden, all fragrant and green, all shining in the rays of the golden spring sun. He was twenty-three; how terribly, how imperceptibly quickly these twenty-three years passed by!.. Life opened up before him.","Glafira Petrovna found it especially unbearable; he simply could not get on without her, and to the end she executed all the sick man’s whims, although there were times when she could not bring herself to answer him at once for fear that her voice might betray the wrath which choked her. In this way he scraped along for another two years and died early one May, out on the balcony, in the sun. ‘Glashka, Glashka! My beef-tea, my beef-tea, you old hag…’ he mumbled with his stiffening tongue and, without finishing the final word, fell silent forever. Glafira Petrovna, who had only just taken the cup of beef-tea from the steward’s hands, stopped, looked into her brother’s face, slowly, with a broad flourish, made the sign of the cross and withdrew in silence; and his son, who was also present, said nothing, but leaned on the handrail of the balcony and gazed long and hard into the garden that was all perfumed and green and glistening in the rays of a golden springtime sun. He was twenty-three years old; how terribly, how insensibly swift had been the passing of those twenty-three years!… Life was opening its arms before him.","Glafira Petrovna was specially necessary to him; he absolutely could not get on without her—and to the end she always carried out every whim of the sick man, though sometimes she could not bring herself to answer at once for fear the sound of her voice should betray her inward anger. Thus he lingered on for two years and died on the first day of May, when he had been brought out on to the balcony into the sun. “Glasha, Glashka! soup, soup, old foo——” his halting tongue muttered and before he had articulated the last word, it was silent for ever. Glafira Petrovna, who had only just taken the cup of soup from the hands of the steward, stopped, looked at her brother’s face, slowly made a large sign of the cross and turned away in silence; and his son, who happened to be there, also said nothing; he leaned on the railing of the balcony and gazed a long while into the garden, all fragrant and green, and shining in the rays of the golden sunshine of spring. He was twenty-three years old; how terribly, how imperceptibly quickly those twenty-three years had passed by!... Life was opening before him."
– По какому случаю?,- On what occasion?,‘For what occasion?’,“On what occasion?”
"– Ну, это еще не доказательство.","Well, that's not proof yet.","‘Well, that’s hardly any proof.’","“Well, that does not prove it.”"
"– Я почти ничего не пишу, – возразил Паншин, – я ведь это только так, между делом… А разве вы поете?","- I write almost nothing, - Panshin objected, - I only do it in the meantime ... But do you sing?","‘I have written almost nothing,’ Panshin replied. ‘I only did this for amusement, in my spare time…. Do you sing?’","“I hardly compose at all,” replied Panshin. “That was only thrown off in the intervals of business... but do you sing?”"
"– Вы добры, – повторил Лаврецкий. – Я топорный человек, а чувствую, что все должны вас любить. Вот хоть бы Лемм; он просто влюблен в вас.","“You are kind,” repeated Lavretsky. “I am a clumsy person, but I feel that everyone should love you. Here though Lemm; he is just in love with you.","‘You have a kind nature,’ Lavretsky repeated. ‘I’m an uncouth sort of chap, but I feel that everyone is bound to love you. Take Lemm, for example; he’s quite simply in love with you.’","“You are good,” repeated Lavretsky. “I am a rough fellow, but I feel that every one must love you. There’s Lemm for instance; he is simply in love with you.”"
"– Вы желали меня видеть, – сказал он, холодно кланяясь.","“You wanted to see me,” he said, bowing coldly.","‘You wished to see me,’ he said, coldly bowing.","“You wanted to see me,” he said, bowing coldly."
"Первую из них звали Марьей Дмитриевной Калитиной. Ее муж, бывший губернский прокурор, известный в свое время делец, – человек бойкий и решительный, желчный и упрямый, – умер лет десять тому назад. Он получил изрядное воспитание, учился в университете, но, рожденный в сословии бедном, рано понял необходимость проложить себе дорогу я набить деньгу. Марья Дмитриевна вышла за него по любви: он был недурен собою, умен и, когда хотел, очень любезен. Марья Дмитриевна (в девицах Пестова) еще в детстве лишилась родителей, провела несколько лет в Москве, в институте, и, вернувшись оттуда, жила в пятидесяти верстах от О…, в родовом своем селе Покровском, с теткой да с старшим братом. Брат этот скоро переселился в Петербург на службу и держал и сестру и тетку в черном теле, пока внезапная смерть не положила предела его поприщу. Марья Дмитриевна наследовала Покровское, но не долго жила в нем; на второй же год после ее свадьбы с Калитиным, который в несколько дней успел покорить ее сердце, Покровское было променено на другое имение, гораздо более доходное, но некрасивое и без усадьбы; и в то же время Калитин приобрел дом в городе О…, где и поселился с женою на постоянное жительство. При доме находился большой сад; одной стороной он выходил прямо в поле, за город. «Стало быть, – решил Калитин, большой неохотник до сельской тишины, – в деревню таскаться незачем». Марья Дмитриевна не раз в душе пожалела о своем хорошеньком Покровском с веселой речкой, широкими лугами и зелеными рощами; но она ни в чем не прекословила мужу и благоговела пред его умом и знанием света. Когда же, после пятнадцатилетнего брака, он умер, оставив сына и двух дочерей, Марья Дмитриевна уже до того привыкла к своему дому и к городской жизни, что сама не захотела выехать из О…","The first of them was called Marya Dmitrievna Kalitina. Her husband, a former provincial prosecutor, a well-known businessman in his time, a lively and decisive man, bilious and stubborn, died about ten years ago. He received a fair upbringing, studied at the university, but, born in the poor class, he early understood the need to pave his way and fill the money. Marya Dmitrievna married him out of love: he was good-looking, intelligent, and, when he wanted, very amiable. Marya Dmitrievna (in the maiden name of Pestov) lost her parents in childhood, spent several years in Moscow, at the institute, and, returning from there, lived fifty versts from O ..., in her ancestral village of Pokrovskoye, with her aunt and older brother. This brother soon moved to Petersburg to serve and kept both his sister and aunt in a black body until sudden death put an end to his career. Marya Dmitrievna inherited Pokrovskoye, but did not live long in it; in the second year after her marriage to Kalitin, who managed to win her heart in a few days, Pokrovskoye was exchanged for another estate, much more profitable, but ugly and without an estate; and at the same time, Kalitin bought a house in the city of O ..., where he settled with his wife for permanent residence. The house had a large garden; on one side it went straight into the field, out of the city. “So,” Kalitin, a great reluctant to rural silence, decided, “there is no need to go to the village.” Marya Dmitrievna more than once in her heart regretted her pretty Pokrovsky with a cheerful river, wide meadows and green groves; but she did not contradict her husband in anything and was in awe of his mind and knowledge of the world. When, after a fifteen-year marriage, he died, leaving a son and two daughters, Marya Dmitrievna was already so accustomed to her home and city life that she herself did not want to leave O ...","The first was called Marya Dmitrievna Kalitin. Her husband, formerly a provincial procurator and well known in his time as a businessman – a lively and decisive chap, contentious and stubborn – had died ten years before. He had received an unusually good education and had been to a university, but, being born in poor circumstances, he had early understood the need to make his own way in the world and accumulate money. Marya Dmitrievna had married him for love: he had been handsome, clever and, when he wished, very courteous. Marya Dmitrievna (whose maiden name was Pestov) had lost her parents when she was still a child and had spent several years in an institution in Moscow; and when she returned from there she lived about thirty miles from O…, in her native village of Pokrovskoye, with her aunt and elder brother. This brother soon moved to St Petersburg on government service and kept his sister and aunt in virtual bondage to him until his death put an end to his career. Marya Dmitrievna inherited Pokrovskoye, but did not live there long; in the second year of her marriage to Kalitin, who had succeeded in capturing her heart after only a few days’ courtship, Pokrovskoye was exchanged for another estate that was much more profitable, but inelegant and lacking a manorial house. At the same time Kalitin acquired a house in the town of O… as a permanent residence for his wife and himself. The house had a large garden and on one side it faced open country beyond the town. ‘ So,’ decided Kalitin, who was no lover of rural quiet, ‘there’ll be no need to go traipsing off into the country.’ More than once Marya Dmitrievna pined for her pretty Pokrovskoye with its gay little stream, broad meadows and green woods, but she did not gainsay her husband in anything and stood in awe of his intellect and knowledge of the world. When, after fifteen years of marriage, he died, leaving her a son and two daughters, Marya Dmitrievna had become so accustomed to her house and to town life that she had no wish to leave O…","The name of the former was Marya Dmitrievna Kalitin. Her husband, a shrewd determined man of obstinate bilious temperament, had been dead for ten years. He had been a provincial public prosecutor, noted in his own day as a successful man of business. He had received a fair education and had been to the university; but having been born in narrow circumstances he realized early in life the necessity of pushing his own way in the world and making money. It had been a love-match on Marya Dmitrievna’s side. He was not bad-looking, was clever and could be very agreeable when he chose. Marya Dmitrievna Pesto—that was her maiden name—had lost her parents in childhood. She spent some years in a boarding-school in Moscow, and after leaving school, lived on the family estate of Pokrovskoe, about forty miles from O——, with her aunt and her elder brother. This brother soon after obtained a post in Petersburg, and made them a scanty allowance. He treated his aunt and sister very shabbily till his sudden death cut short his career. Marya Dmitrievna inherited Pokrovskoe, but she did not live there long. Two years after her marriage with Kalitin, who succeeded in winning her heart in a few days, Pokrovskoe was exchanged for another estate, which yielded a much larger income, but was utterly unattractive and had no house. At the same time Kalitin took a house in the town of O——, in which he and his wife took up their permanent abode. There was a large garden round the house, which on one side looked out upon the open country away from the town. “And so,” decided Kalitin, who had a great distaste for the quiet of country life, “there would be no need for them to be dragging themselves off into the country.” In her heart Marya Dmitrievna more than once regretted her pretty Pokrovskoe, with its babbling brook, its wide meadows, and green copses; but she never opposed her husband in anything and had the greatest veneration for his wisdom and knowledge of the world. When after fifteen years of married life he died leaving her with a son and two daughters, Marya Dmitrievna had grown so accustomed to her house and to town life that she had no inclination to leave O——."
Паншин быстро провел пальцами по клавишам; едва заметная усмешка скользнула по его губам.,Panshin quickly ran his fingers over the keys; A faint smile flickered across his lips.,Panshin quickly ran his fingers along the keys and a faintly perceptible grin flickered on his lips.,"Panshin ran his fingers quickly over the keys, and a scarcely perceptible smile glided over his lips."
"– Вы поете? – промолвила Варвара Павловна, озарив его светлым и быстрым взором. – Садитесь. Паншин стал отговариваться.","- You sing? Varvara Pavlovna uttered, illuminating him with her bright and quick eyes. - Sit down. Panshin began to make excuses.","‘You sing, do you?’ asked Varvara Pavlovna, flashing a bright, quick glance at him. ‘Sit down.’ Panshin began to cry off.","“Do you sing?” said Varvara Pavlovna, enfolding him in a rapid radiant look. “Sit down.” Panshin began to cry off."
"– За что ты меня убила? За что ты меня убила? – так начала свои жалобы огорченная вдова. – Кого тебе еще нужно? Чем он тебе не муж? Камер-юнкер! не интересан! Он в Петербурге на любой фрейлине мог бы жениться. А я-то, я-то надеялась! И давно ли ты к нему изменилась? Откуда-нибудь эта туча надута, не сама собой пришла. Уж не тот ли фофан? Вот нашла советчика!","- Why did you kill me? Why did you kill me? - so began her complaints distressed widow. Who else do you need? Why is he not your husband? Chamber junker! not interested! He could have married any lady-in-waiting in Petersburg. And I, I was hoping! And how long have you changed for him? From somewhere this cloud is inflated, it did not come by itself. Isn't that the fofan? I have found an adviser!","‘Why have you been the death of me? Why?’ was how the embittered widow began her complaints. ‘Who else do you need? What’s wrong with him for a husband? He has a position at court! He doesn’t need to marry for money! In St Petersburg he could marry any lady-in-waiting! But for me, for me, there were such hopes! And how long is it since your feeling for him has changed? This cloud’s been blown up from somewhere, it didn’t come of its own accord. Is it that idiot relative of mine? What an adviser you’ve found!’","“Do you want to be the death of me? Do you want to be the death of me?” was how the disconsolate widow began her lamentations. “Whom do you want? Wasn’t he good enough for you? A kammer-junker! not interesting! He might have married any Maid of Honour he liked in Petersburg. And I—I had so hoped for it! Is it long that you have changed towards him? How has this misfortune come on us,—it cannot have come of itself! Is it that dolt of a cousin’s doing? A nice person you have picked up to advise you!”"
– И вы не боитесь ездить на такой злой лошади? – спросила его Марья Дмитриевна.,“And you are not afraid to ride such an evil horse?” Marya Dmitrievna asked him.,‘Aren’t you afraid of riding such a frisky horse?’ Marya Dmitrievna asked him.,“Aren’t you afraid to ride such a vicious horse?” Marya Dmitrievna questioned him.
"– Артист в душе, и такой любезный. Вы его увидите. Он все это время очень часто у меня бывал; я пригласила его на сегодняшний вечер; надеюсь, что он приедет, – прибавила Марья Дмитриевна с коротким вздохом и косвенной горькой улыбкой. Лиза поняла значение этой улыбки; но ей было не до того.","“An artist at heart, and so kind. You will see him. All this time he visited me very often; I invited him to this evening; I hope he will come,” added Marya Dmitrievna with a short sigh and an indirect bitter smile. Liza understood the meaning of that smile; but she was not up to it.","‘The soul of an artist, and so charming. You will see him. All the time he has been coming here very frequently; I invited him for this evening; I do hope he comes.’ added Marya Dmitrievna with a short sigh and a bitter smile to one side. Liza understood the meaning of this smile, but was unconcerned by it.","“An artist at heart, and so well-bred. You shall see him. He has been here very often of late: I invited him for this evening; I hope he will come,” added Marya Dmitrievna with a gentle sigh, and an oblique smile of bitterness. Lisa knew the meaning of this smile, but it was nothing to her now."
"Марья Дмитриевна встала; Сергей Петрович тоже встал и поклонился. «Елене Михайловне наше нижайшее», – проговорил он и, отойдя в угол для приличия, принялся сморкать свой длинный и правильный нос.","Marya Dmitrievna got up; Sergei Petrovich also stood up and bowed. “To Elena Mikhailovna our lowest,” he said, and, stepping into a corner for decency, he began to blow his long and regular nose.","Marya Dmitrievna rose. Sergey Petrovich rose also, bowed, said: ‘Our most humble respects to Elena Mikhaylovna,’ and, withdrawing into a corner out of politeness, proceeded to blow his long straight nose.","Marya Dmitrievna got up; Sergei Petrovitch also rose and made a bow. “Our humble respects to Elena Mihalovna,” he said, and turning aside into a corner for good manners, he began blowing his long straight nose."
"Однажды Лаврецкий, по обыкновению своему, сидел у Калитиных. После томительного жаркого дня наступил такой прекрасный вечер, что Марья Дмитриевна, несмотря на свое отвращение к сквозному ветру, велела отворить все окна и двери в сад и объявила, что в карты играть не станет, что в такую погоду в карты играть грех, а должно наслаждаться природой. Из гостей был один Паншин. Настроенный вечером и не желая петь перед Лаврецким, но чувствуя прилив художнических ощущений, он пустился в поэзию: прочел хорошо, но слишком сознательно и с ненужными тонкостями, несколько стихотворений Лермонтова (тогда Пушкин не успел еще опять войти в моду) – и вдруг, как бы устыдясь своих излияний, начал, по поводу известной «Думы», укорять и упрекать новейшее поколение; причем не упустил случая изложить, как бы он все повернул по-своему, если б власть у него была в руках. «Россия, – говорил он, – отстала от Европы; нужно подогнать ее. Уверяют, что мы молоды, – это вздор; да и притом у нас изобретательности нет; сам Х<омяко>в признается в том, что мы даже мышеловки не выдумали. Следовательно, мы поневоле должны заимствовать у других. Мы больны, говорит Лермонтов, – я согласен с ним; но мы больны оттого, что только наполовину сделались европейцами; чем мы ушиблись, тем мы и лечиться должны («Le cadastre», – подумал Лаврецкий). У нас, – продолжал он, – лучшие головы – les meilleures tetes – давно в этом убедились; все народы в сущности одинаковы; вводите только хорошие учреждения – и дело с концом. Пожалуй, можно приноравливаться к существующему народному быту; это наше дело, дело людей… (он чуть не сказал: государственных) служащих; но, в случае нужды, не беспокойтесь: учреждения переделают самый этот быт». Марья Дмитриевна с умилением поддакивала Паншину. «Вот какой, – думала она, – умный человек у меня беседует». Лиза молчала, прислонившись к окну; Лаврецкий молчал тоже; Марфа Тимофеевна, игравшая в уголке в карты с своей приятельницей, ворчала себе что-то под нос. Паншин расхаживал по комнате и говорил красиво, но с тайным озлобленьем: казалось, он бранил не целое поколенье, а нескольких известных ему людей. В саду Калитиных, в большом кусту сирени, жил соловей; его первые вечерние звуки раздавались в промежутках красноречивой речи; первые звезды зажигались на розовом небе над неподвижными верхушками лип. Лаврецкий поднялся и начал возражать Паншину; завязался спор. Лаврецкий отстаивал молодость и самостоятельность России; отдавал себя, свое поколение на жертву, – но заступался за новых людей, за их убеждения и желания; Паншин возражал раздражительно и резко, объявил, что умные люди должны все переделать, и занесся, наконец, до того, что, забыв свое камер-юнкерское звание и чиновничью карьеру, назвал Лаврецкого отсталым консерватором, даже намекнул – правда, весьма отдаленно – на его ложное положение в обществе. Лаврецкий не рассердился, не возвысил голоса (он вспомнил, что Михалевич тоже называл его отсталым – только вольтериянцем) – и спокойно разбил Паншина на всех пунктах. Он доказал ему невозможность скачков и надменных переделок с высоты чиновничьего самосознания – переделок, не оправданных ни знанием родной земли, ни действительной верой в идеал, хотя бы отрицательный; привел в пример свое собственное воспитание, требовал прежде всего признания народной правды и смирения перед нею – того смирения, без которого и смелость противу лжи невозможна; не отклонился, наконец, от заслуженного, по его мнению, упрека в легкомысленной растрате времени и сил.","One day Lavretsky, as was his custom, was sitting with the Kalitins. After a languid hot day, such a beautiful evening came that Marya Dmitrievna, despite her disgust for the through wind, ordered all the windows and doors to the garden to be opened and announced that she would not play cards, that in such weather it was a sin to play cards, but one should enjoying the nature. Panshin was one of the guests. In the evening, and not wanting to sing in front of Lavretsky, but feeling a surge of artistic sensations, he plunged into poetry: he read well, but too consciously and with unnecessary subtleties, several poems by Lermontov (then Pushkin had not yet had time to come back into fashion) - and suddenly, as ashamed of his outpourings, he began, in connection with the well-known ""Duma"", to reproach and reproach the newest generation; moreover, he did not miss the opportunity to state how he would have turned everything in his own way, if the power had been in his hands. “Russia,” he said, “has lagged behind Europe; you have to push her. They say that we are young is nonsense; and besides, we have no ingenuity; H<omyako>v himself admits that we have not even invented mousetraps. Therefore, we must necessarily borrow from others. We are sick, says Lermontov, - I agree with him; but we are sick because we have only become half Europeans; what hurt us is how we should be treated (“Le cadastre,” thought Lavretsky). We have, - he continued, - the best heads - les meilleures tetes - have long been convinced of this; all peoples are essentially the same; introduce only good institutions and that's it. Perhaps you can adapt to the existing folk way of life; this is our business, the business of people ... (he almost said: state) employees; but, in case of need, do not worry: institutions will remake this very life. Marya Dmitrievna assented to Panshin with emotion. ""That's what,"" she thought, ""a smart man is talking to me."" Liza was silent, leaning against the window; Lavretsky was also silent; Marfa Timofeevna, who was playing cards with her friend in the corner, grumbled something under her breath. Panshin paced the room and spoke beautifully, but with secret anger: it seemed that he was scolding not a whole generation, but several people known to him. In the Kalitins' garden, in a large lilac bush, lived a nightingale; his first evening sounds were heard in the intervals of eloquent speech; the first stars lit up in the pink sky above the motionless tops of the lindens. Lavretsky got up and began to object to Panshin; a dispute ensued. Lavretsky defended the youth and independence of Russia; he sacrificed himself, his generation, but stood up for new people, for their beliefs and desires; Panshin objected irritably and sharply, announced that smart people should redo everything, and finally carried himself so far that, forgetting his chamber junker rank and bureaucratic career, he called Lavretsky a backward conservative, even hinted - though very remotely - at his false position in society. Lavretsky did not get angry, did not raise his voice (he remembered that Mikhalevich had also called him a backward man - only a Voltairian) - and calmly defeated Panshin on all points. He proved to him the impossibility of leaps and arrogant alterations from the height of bureaucratic self-consciousness - alterations that are not justified either by knowledge of their native land, or by real faith in an ideal, even a negative one; he cited his own upbringing as an example, demanded, first of all, the recognition of the people's truth and humility before it - that humility, without which courage against lies is impossible; finally, he did not deviate from the well-deserved, in his opinion, reproach for the frivolous waste of time and effort.","ONCE Lavretsky, in his usual way, was sitting at the Kalitins. A tiresomely hot day had been succeeded by such a beautiful evening that Marya Dmitrievna, despite her aversion to draughts, had ordered all the windows and doors into the garden to be opened and announced that she would not play cards, that it was a sin to play cards in such weather and it was right to enjoy the beauties of nature. Panshin was the only guest. Inspired by the evening and yet unwilling to sing in front of Lavretsky, but experiencing an access of artistic feelings, he launched into poetry: he read well, but too deliberately and with unnecessary niceties, several poems by Lermontov1 (in those days Pushkin had not yet come back into fashion) – and suddenly, as if ashamed of his outpourings, began, apropos of the well-known poem Duma, to attack the younger generation; added to which, he did not overlook the opportunity to expound how he would change everything if he had the power. ‘ Russia,’ he said, ‘has fallen behind Europe; we must catch up. People assert that we’re young – that’s nonsense; besides, we lack inventiveness; Khomyakov2 himself has admitted that we did not even invent the mousetrap. Consequently, we must borrow willy-nilly from others. We’re sick, says Lermontov, and I agree with him; but we’re sick because we’ve only become half-European; we must cure ourselves with more of what’s made us sick.’ (‘Le cadastre,’ thought Lavretsky.) ‘Among us’, he continued, ‘the best minds – les meilleures têtes – have long been convinced of this; all nations are in substance the same; you have only to introduce good institutions, and that’s the end of the matter. Certainly the institutions can be modified to suit the existing national customs; that is our business, the business of men of…’ (he almost said: men of state) ‘of government servants; but if the need arises, you needn’t worry: the institutions will remake the national customs.’ Marya Dmitrievna ranged herself admiringly on Panshin’s side with nods of the head ‘What an intelligent talker I have in my house,’ she thought; Liza was silent, leaning at the open window; Lavretsky was also silent; Marfa Timofeyevna, playing cards in one corner with her friend, mumbled something under her breath. Panshin walked up and down the room and spoke eloquently, but with secret exasperation, as if he was scolding not a whole generation but a few of those known to him. In the Kalitins’ garden, in a large lilac bush, lived a nightingale; the first notes of its evening song resounded during pauses in the eloquent speech; the first stars were alight in the rosy sky above the motionless tips of the limes. Lavretsky stood up and began to counter Panshin’s words; a controversy developed. Lavretsky upheld the youth and independence of Russia; he sacrificed himself and his own generation, but he interceded for the new men, for their convictions and desires; Panshin made bad-tempered and sharp rejoinders, declared that intelligent people must change everything and was finally carried away to the point where, forgetting his court status and civil service career, he called Lavretsky an outdated conservative and even hinted – true, very remotely – at his false position in society. Lavretsky did not lose his temper, did not raise his voice (he remembered that Mikhalevich had also called him outdated, only a Voltairean) and calmly defeated Panshin on all points. He demonstrated to him the impossibility of progress by leaps and bounds or making high-handed changes from above through officialdom – changes justified neither by a knowledge of one’s native land, nor by genuine belief in an ideal, even a negative one; he cited his own education as an example and he demanded first of all a recognition of Russia’s own popular ‘truth’ and reconciliation with it – that recon ciliation, without which opposition to falsehood is impossible; finally, he did not attempt to evade the – in his opinion – deserved reproach of having lightmindedly wasted his time and energies.","One day Lavretsky, according to his habit, was at the Kalitins’. After an exhaustingly hot day, such a lovely evening had set in that Marya Dmitrievna, in spite of her aversion to a draught, ordered all the windows and doors into the garden to be thrown open, and declared that she would not play cards, that it was a sin to play cards in such weather, and one ought to enjoy nature. Panshin was the only guest. He was stimulated by the beauty of the evening, and conscious of a flood of artistic sensations, but he did not care to sing before Lavretsky, so he fell to reading poetry; he read aloud well, but too self-consciously and with unnecessary refinements, a few poems of Lermontov (Pushkin had not then come into fashion again). Then suddenly, as though ashamed of his enthusiasm, began, a propos of the well-known poem, “A Reverie,” to attack and fall foul of the younger generation. While doing so he did not lose the opportunity of expounding how he would change everything! after his own fashion, if the power were in his hands. “Russia,” he said, “has fallen behind Europe; we must catch her up. It is maintained that we are young—that’s nonsense. Moreover we have no inventiveness: Homakov himself admits that we have not even invented mouse-traps. Consequently, whether we will or no, we must borrow from others. We are sick, Lermontov says—I agree with him. But we are sick from having only half become Europeans, we must take a hair of the dog that bit us (“le cadastre,” thought Lavretsky). “The best head, les meilleures tetes,” he continued, “among us have long been convinced of it. All peoples are essentially alike; only introduce among them good institutions, and the thing is done. Of course there may be adaptation to the existing national life; that is our affair—the affair of the official (he almost said “governing” ) class. But in case of need don’t be uneasy. The institutions will transform the life itself.” Marya Dmitrievna most feelingly assented to all Panshin said. “What a clever man,” she thought, “is talking in my drawing-room!” Lisa sat in silence leaning back against the window; Lavretsky too was silent. Marfa Timofyevna, playing cards with her old friend in the corner, muttered something to herself. Panshin walked up and down the room, and spoke eloquently, but with secret exasperation. It seemed as if he were abusing not a whole generation but a few people known to him. In a great lilac bush in the Kalitins’ garden a nightingale had built its nest; its first evening notes filled the pauses of the eloquent speech; the first stars were beginning to shine in the rosy sky over the motionless tops of the limes. Lavretsky got up and began to answer Panshin; an argument sprang up. Lavretsky championed the youth and the independence of Russia; he was ready to throw over himself and his generation, but he stood up for the new men, their convictions and desires. Panshin answered sharply and irritably. He maintained that the intelligent people ought to change everything, and was at last even brought to the point of forgetting his position as a kammer-yunker, and his career as an official, and calling Lavretsky an antiquated conservative, even hinting—very remotely it is true—at his dubious position in society. Lavretsky did not lose his temper. He did not raise his voice (he recollected that Mihalevitch too had called him antiquated but an antiquated Voltairean), and calmly proceeded to refute Panshin at all points. He proved to him the impracticability of sudden leaps and reforms from above, founded neither on knowledge of the mother-country, nor on any genuine faith in any ideal, even a negative one. He brought forward his own education as an example, and demanded before all things a recognition of the true spirit of the people and submission to it, without which even a courageous combat against error is impossible. Finally he admitted the reproach—well-deserved as he thought—of reckless waste of time and strength."
"– Можно видеть Марфу Тимофеевну? – спросил он, замечая, что Паншин с еще большим достоинством принимался тасовать карты. Художника в нем уже не замечалось и тени.","- Can I see Marfa Timofeevna? he asked, noticing that Panshin began shuffling the cards with even greater dignity. The artist in it was no longer noticed even a shadow.","‘May I see Marfa Timofeyevna?’ he asked, when he noticed that Panshin had started shuffling the cards with even greater dignity. There was no inkling of the artist in him at that moment.","“Can I see Marfa Timofyevna?” he inquired, observing that Panshin was setting to work to shuffle the cards with still more dignity. There was not a trace of the artist to be detected in him now."
"– Наши убеждения на этот счет слишком различны, Лизавета Михайловна, – произнес Лаврецкий довольно – резко, – мы не поймем друг друга. Лиза побледнела; все тело ее слегка затрепетало, но она не замолчала.","“Our convictions on this point are too different, Lizaveta Mikhailovna,” Lavretsky said quite sharply, “we won’t understand each other. Liza turned pale; her whole body trembled slightly, but she did not stop.","‘Our convictions on that account are too far apart, Lizaveta Mikhaylovna,’ said Lavretsky rather sharply. ‘We will not understand each other.’ Liza went pale; her whole body gave a slight shudder, but she did not fall silent.","“Our convictions on that subject are too different, Lisaveta Mihalovna,” Lavretsky observed, rather sharply; “we cannot understand one another.” Lisa grew paler: her whole frame was trembling slightly; but she was not silenced."
"Лиза была спокойна по обыкновению, но более обыкновенного бледна. Она достала из кармана и протянула Лаврецкому мелко сложенный лист журнала.","Lisa was calm as usual, but paler than usual. She took from her pocket and handed Lavretsky a finely folded sheet of a magazine.","Liza was calm and composed as usual, but more than usually pale. She took from her pocket and handed to Lavretsky the tightly folded sheet of newspaper.",Lisa was as calm as usual but more than usually pale. She took out of her pocket and held out to Lavretsky the sheet of the newspaper folded up small.
"Лаврецкий взял карету и велел везти себя за город. Весь остаток дня и всю ночь до утра пробродил он, беспрестанно останавливаясь и всплескивая руками: он то безумствовал, то ему становилось как будто смешно, даже как будто весело. Утром он прозяб и зашел в дрянной загородный трактир, спросил комнату и сел на стул перед окном. Судорожная зевота напала на него. Он едва держался на ногах, тело его изнемогало, а он и не чувствовал усталости, – зато усталость брала свое: он сидел, глядел и ничего не понимал; не понимал, что с ним такое случилось, отчего он очутился один, с одеревенелыми членами, с горечью во рту, с камнем на груди, в пустой незнакомой комнате; он не понимал, что заставило ее, Варю, отдаться этому французу, и как могла она, зная себя неверной, быть по-прежнему спокойной, по-прежнему ласковой и доверчивой с ним! «Ничего не понимаю! – шептали его засохшие губы. – Кто мне поручится теперь, что в Петербурге…» И он не доканчивал вопроса и зевал опять, дрожа и пожимаясь всем телом. Светлые и темные воспоминания одинаково его терзали; ему вдруг пришло в голову, что на днях она при нем и при Эрнесте села за фортепьяно и спела: «Старый муж, грозный муж!» Он вспомнил выражение ее лица, странный блеск глаз и краску на щеках, – и он поднялся со стула, он хотел пойти, сказать им: «Вы со мной напрасно пошутили; прадед мой мужиков за ребра вешал, а дед мой сам был мужик», – да убить их обоих. То вдруг ему казалось, что все, что с ним делается, сон, и даже не сон, а так, вздор какой-то; что стоит только встряхнуться, оглянуться… Он оглядывался, и, как ястреб когтит пойманную птицу, глубже и глубже врезывалась тоска в его сердце. К довершению всего, Лаврецкий через несколько месяцев надеялся быть отцом… Прошедшее, будущее, вся жизнь была отравлена. Он вернулся наконец в Париж, остановился в гостинице и послал Варваре Павловне записку г-на Эрнеста с следующим письмом:","Lavretsky took a carriage and ordered that he be taken outside the city. All the rest of the day and all night until morning he wandered, stopping incessantly and clasping his hands: now he was mad, now he seemed to feel funny, even like it was fun. In the morning he was chilly and went into a shabby country tavern, asked for a room and sat down on a chair in front of the window. A convulsive yawn attacked him. He could hardly stand on his feet, his body was exhausted, and he did not feel tired, but fatigue took its toll: he sat, looked and did not understand anything; he did not understand what had happened to him, why he found himself alone, with stiff limbs, bitterness in his mouth, with a stone on his chest, in an empty unfamiliar room; he did not understand what made her, Varya, give herself to this Frenchman, and how could she, knowing herself unfaithful, be still calm, still affectionate and trusting with him! “I don’t understand anything! his dry lips whispered. “Who can guarantee me now that in Petersburg ...” And he did not finish the question and yawned again, trembling and shrugging his whole body. Light and dark memories tormented him equally; it suddenly occurred to him that the other day, in his presence and in Ernest's presence, she sat down at the piano and sang: ""Old husband, formidable husband!"" He remembered the expression on her face, the strange gleam in her eyes and the color on her cheeks, and he got up from his chair, he wanted to go and tell them: “You shouldn't have joked with me; my great-grandfather hung men by the ribs, and my grandfather himself was a man, ”and kill them both. Then suddenly it seemed to him that everything that was happening to him was a dream, and not even a dream, but just like that, some kind of nonsense; that one has only to shake oneself, look around... He looked around, and, like a hawk claws at a caught bird, anguish cut deeper and deeper into his heart. To top it off, Lavretsky hoped to be a father in a few months ... The past, the future, all life was poisoned. He finally returned to Paris, stayed at a hotel, and sent Varvara Pavlovna a note from Mr. Ernest with the following letter:","Lavretsky took a cab and ordered to be taken out of town. The remainder of the day and the whole night until morning he wandered about, endlessly stopping and flinging wide his arms: he was either out of his mind, or things came to seem to him somehow laughable, somehow even gay. By the morning he was thoroughly chilled and called at a miserable inn on the city’s outskirts, asked for a room and sat down on a chair by the window. A compulsive yawning took possession of him. He could scarcely keep on his feet, his body was exhausted, yet he could not even feel the tiredness, though the tiredness took its toll: he went on sitting there, staring and understanding nothing; he couldn’t understand what had happened to him, why he was there alone, with his limbs all numb, a bitter taste in his mouth, a dead weight on his heart, in an empty unfamiliar room; he couldn’t understand what had made her, Varya, give herself to this Frenchman and how, knowing herself to be unfaithful, she could maintain her former composure, her former tenderness and trustfulness towards him. ‘I don’t understand a thing,’ his parched lips whispered. ‘Who’ll guarantee to me now that in St Petersburg…’ And he could not bring himself to finish the question and yawned again, his whole body shuddering and shaking. Bright and dark memories tore with equal anguish at his heart; suddenly he recalled that a few days ago she had sat down along with him and Ernest at the piano and had sung: ‘Old husband, threatening husband!’ He recalled the expression on her face, the strange brilliance in her eyes and the colour in her cheeks – and he rose from the chair, wanting to go and say to them: ‘You’re not going to get away with making fun of me! My great-grandad used to hang his peasants up by the ribs, and my grandad was himself a peasant’ – and then kill them both. Then it suddenly seemed to him that everything happening to him was a dream, and not even a dream, but just some sort of nonsense that he could get rid of by shaking himself or turning his head…. He turned his head and, as a hawk drives its talons into its captive prey, so the pangs of regret cut deeper and deeper into his heart. To crown it all, Lavretsky was hoping in a few months to be a father…. The past, the future, the whole of his life was poisoned. He returned finally to Paris, stopped in an hotel and sent Varvara Pavlovna M. Ernest’s note together with the following letter:","Lavretsky took a cab and ordered the man to drive him out of town. All the rest of the day and the whole night he wandered about, constantly stopping short and wringing his hands, at one moment he was mad, and the next he was ready to laugh, was even merry after a fashion. By the morning he grew calm through exhaustion, and went into a wretched tavern in the outskirts, asked for a room and sat down on a chair before the window. He was overtaken by a fit of convulsive yawning. He could scarcely stand upright, his whole body was worn out, and he did not even feel fatigue, though fatigue began to do its work; he sat and gazed and comprehended nothing; he did not understand what had happened to him, why he found himself alone, with his limbs stiff, with a taste of bitterness in his mouth, with a load on his heart, in an empty unfamiliar room; he did not understand what had impelled her, his Varya, to give herself to this Frenchman, and how, knowing herself unfaithful, she could go on being just as calm, just as affectionate, as confidential with him as before! “I cannot understand it!” his parched lips whispered. “Who can guarantee now that even in Petersburg”... And he did not finish the question, and yawned again, shivering and shaking all over. Memories—bright and gloomy—fretted him alike; suddenly it crossed his mind how some days before she had sat down to the piano and sung before him and Ernest the song, “Old husband, cruel husband!” He recalled the expression of her face, the strange light in her eyes, and the colour on her cheeks—and he got up from his seat, he would have liked to go to them, to tell them: “You were wrong to play your tricks on me; my great-grandfather used to hang the peasants up by their ribs, and my grandfather was himself a peasant,” and to kill them both. Then all at once it seemed to him as if all that was happening was a dream, scarcely even a dream, but some kind of foolish joke; that he need only shake himself and look round... He looked round, and like a! hawk clutching its captured prey, anguish gnawed deeper and deeper into his heart. To complete it all Lavretsky had been hoping in a few months to be a father.... The past, the future, his whole life was poisoned. He went back at last to Paris, stopped at an hotel and sent M. Ernest’s note to Varvara Pavlovna with the following letter:—"
"Однажды, в театре (Мочалов находился тогда на высоте своей славы, и Лаврецкий не пропускал ни одного представления), увидел он в ложе бельэтажа девушку, – и хотя ни одна женщина не проходила мимо его угрюмой фигуры, не заставив дрогнуть его сердце, никогда еще оно так сильно не забилось. Облокотясь на бархат ложи, девушка не шевелилась; чуткая, молодая жизнь играла в каждой черте ее смуглого, круглого, миловидного лица; изящный ум сказывался в прекрасных глазах, внимательно и мягко глядевших из-под тонких бровей, в быстрой усмешке выразительных губ, в самом положении ее головы, рук, шеи; одета она была прелестно. Рядом с нею сидела сморщенная и желтая женщина лет сорока пяти, декольте, в черном токе, с беззубою улыбкой на напряженно озабоченном и пустом лице, а в углублении ложи виднелся пожилой мужчина, в широком сюртуке и высоком галстуке, с выражением тупой величавости и какой-то заискивающей подозрительности в маленьких глазках, с крашеными усами и бакенбардами, незначительным огромным лбом и измятыми щеками, по всем признакам отставной генерал. Лаврецкий не отводил взора от поразившей его девушки; вдруг дверь ложи отворилась, и вошел Михалевич. Появление этого человека, почти единственного его знакомого во всей Москве, появление его в обществе единственной девушки, поглотившей все его внимание, показалось Лаврецкому знаменательно и странно. Продолжая посматривать на ложу, он заметил, что все находившиеся в ней лица обращались с Михалевичем, как с старинным приятелем. Представление на сцене переставало занимать Лаврецкого; сам Мочалов, хотя и был в тот вечер «в ударе», не производил на него обычного впечатления. В одном очень патетическом месте Лаврецкий невольно взглянул на свою красавицу: она вся наклонилась вперед, щеки ее пылали; под влиянием его упорного взора глаза ее, устремленные на сцену, медленно обратились и остановились на нем… Всю ночь мерещились ему эти глаза. Прорвалась, наконец, искусственно возведенная плотина; он и дрожалки горел, и на другой же день отправился к Михалевичу. Он узнал от него, что красавицу звали Варварой Павловной Коробьиной; что старик и старуха, сидевшие с ней в ложе, были отец ее и мать и что сам он, Михалевич, познакомился с ними год тому назад, во время своего пребывания в подмосковной на «кондиции» у графа Н. С величайшей похвалой отозвался энтузиаст о Варваре Павловне. «Это, брат ты мой, – воскликнул он со свойственною ему порывистой певучестью в голосе, – эта девушка – изумительное, гениальное существо, артистка в настоящем смысле слова, и притом предобрая». Заметив из расспросов Лаврецкого, какое впечатление произвела на него Варвара Павловна, он сам предложил ему познакомить его с нею, прибавив, что он у них как свой; что генерал человек совсем не гордый, а мать так глупа, что только тряпки не сосет. Лаврецкий покраснел, пробормотал что-то невнятное и убежал. Целых пять дней боролся он со своею робостью; на шестой день молодой спартанец надел новенький мундир и отдался в распоряжение Михалевичу, который, будучи своим человеком, ограничился тем, что причесал себе волосы, – и оба отправились к Коробьиным.","Once, in the theater (Mochalov was then at the height of his fame, and Lavretsky did not miss a single performance), he saw a girl in the mezzanine box - and although not a single woman passed by his gloomy figure without making his heart tremble, never before it didn't hit that hard. Leaning on the velvet of the box, the girl did not move; sensitive, young life played in every line of her swarthy, round, pretty face; an elegant mind was expressed in the beautiful eyes, attentively and gently looking from under thin eyebrows, in the quick smile of expressive lips, in the very position of her head, hands, neck; she was beautifully dressed. Next to her sat a shriveled and yellow woman of about forty-five, cleavage, in black current, with a toothless smile on a tensely preoccupied and empty face, and in the recess of the box one could see an elderly man, in a wide frock coat and high tie, with an expression of dull majesty and some kind of then ingratiating suspicion in his small eyes, with a painted mustache and sideburns, an insignificant huge forehead and wrinkled cheeks, by all indications a retired general. Lavretsky did not take his eyes off the girl who had struck him; suddenly the door of the box opened, and Mikhalevich entered. The appearance of this man, almost his only acquaintance in all of Moscow, his appearance in the company of the only girl who absorbed all his attention, seemed to Lavretsky significant and strange. Continuing to look at the box, he noticed that all the faces in it treated Mikhalevich as if they were an old friend. Performance on the stage ceased to occupy Lavretsky; Mochalov himself, although he was ""in good spirits"" that evening, did not make the usual impression on him. In one very pathetic passage, Lavretsky involuntarily glanced at his beauty: she was all leaning forward, her cheeks glowing; under the influence of his stubborn gaze, her eyes, fixed on the stage, slowly turned and rested on him ... All night those eyes seemed to him. Finally, the artificially erected dam broke through; he was on fire, and the next day he went to Mikhalevich. He learned from him that the beauty's name was Varvara Pavlovna Korobina; that the old man and the old woman, who were sitting with her in the box, were her father and mother, and that he himself, Mikhalevich, met them a year ago, during his stay in the Moscow region on ""condition"" with Count N. The enthusiast responded with the greatest praise about Varvara Pavlovna. “This, my brother,” he exclaimed with his characteristic impetuous melodiousness in his voice, “this girl is an amazing, brilliant creature, an artist in the true sense of the word, and, moreover, pre-preparing.” Noticing from Lavretsky's questions what impression Varvara Pavlovna had made on him, he himself invited him to introduce him to her, adding that he was like one of their own; that the general is not a proud man at all, and his mother is so stupid that she only sucks rags. Lavretsky blushed, muttered something indistinct, and ran away. For five whole days he struggled with his timidity; on the sixth day, the young Spartan put on a brand new uniform and gave himself up to Mikhalevich, who, being his own man, limited himself to combing his hair, and both went to the Korobins.","On one occasion in the theatre (Mochalov1 was then at the height of his fame and Lavretsky did not miss a single one of his appearances) he caught sight of a girl in a box in the dress circle – and although no woman could pass by his outwardly sombre figure without causing his heart to quiver, it had never begun beating as hard as it did now. Leaning on the velvet of the box’s balustrade, the girl was utterly still; a sensitive, youthful vivacity played in every feature of her dark, round, pleasant face; a tastefully refined mind was reflected in the beautiful eyes gazing softly and attentively from beneath delicate brows, in the swift smiles of her expressive lips, in the very pose of her head and arms and neck; she was delightfully dressed. Next to her there sat a sallow, wrinkled woman of about forty-five in a low-cut dress and black toque, with a toothless smile on her intently preoccupied and empty face, while in the depths of the box could be seen an elderly man in a broad frock-coat and high cravat, with an expression of mindless stateliness and a kind of fawning suspiciousness in his tiny eyes, with dyed moustache and side-whiskers, massive but unremarkable temples and deeply creased cheeks, who gave every indication of being a retired general. Lavretsky could not take his eyes off the stunning girl. Suddenly the door of the box opened and Mikhalevich entered. The appearance of this man, almost his sole acquaintance in the whole of Moscow, in the company of the one girl who had absorbed all his attention, struck Lavretsky as ominous and strange. As he continued to watch the box he noticed that everyone in it treated Mikhalevich as an old friend. The performance on the stage ceased to concern Lavretsky; Mochalov himself, although he was that evening ‘on his best form’, did not make his usual impression on him. In one very moving scene Lavretsky glanced involuntarily at his beauty: she was leaning right forward and her cheeks glowed with excitement; under the influence of his steady gaze her eyes, directed though they were at the stage, slowly turned and rested on him…. All night he could not get them out of his thoughts. The artificially constructed dam had finally been breached; he throbbed and burned with love, and the next day set off to find Mikhalevich. From him he learned that the beauty was called Varvara Pavlovna Korobyn, that the elderly man and woman sitting with her in the box were her father and mother and that he, Mikhalevich, had got to know them a year ago during the time he had spent ‘tutoring’ at Count N’s house near Moscow. The enthusiastic Mikhalevich expressed himself in terms of the greatest praise about Varvara Pavlovna. ‘My dear fellow, that,’ he exclaimed with the characteristically impetuous lilt in his voice, ‘that girl’s a – an astonishing, a – a creature of genius, an artiste in the true sense of the word and kindness itself as well.’ Noting from Lavretsky’s persistent questions the kind of impression Varvara Pavolvna had made on him, he offered to introduce him to her, adding that he was treated like one of them at their house, that the general was not at all arrogant and the mother was so silly that about all she didn’t do was suck eggs. Lavretsky went red, mumbled something unintelligible and fled. For five whole days he struggled with his shyness; on the sixth the young Spartan dressed himself up in a new uniform and placed himself at Mikhalevich’s disposal, who, being a friend of the family, did no more than comb his hair – and both of them set off for the Korobyns’.","One day at the theatre—Motchalov was then at the height of his fame and Lavretsky did not miss a single performance—he saw in a box in the front tier a young girl, and though no woman ever came near his grim figure without setting his heart beating, it had never beaten so violently before. The young girl sat motionless, leaning with her elbows on the velvet of the box; the light of youth and life played in every feature of her dark, oval, lovely face; subtle intelligence was expressed in the splendid eyes which gazed softly and attentively from under her fine brows, in the swift smile on her expressive lips, in the very pose of her head, her hands, her neck. She was exquisitely dressed. Beside her sat a yellow and wrinkled woman of forty-five, with a low neck, in a black headdress, with a toothless smile on her intently-preoccupied and empty face, and in the inner recesses of the box was visible an elderly man in a wide frock-coat and high cravat, with an expression of dull dignity and a kind of ingratiating distrustfulness in his little eyes, with dyed moustache and whiskers, a large meaningless forehead and wrinkled cheeks, by every sign a retired general. Lavretsky did not take his eyes off the girl who had made such an impression on him; suddenly the door of the box opened and Mihalevitch went in. The appearance of this man, almost his one acquaintance in Moscow, in the society of the one girl who was absorbing his whole attention, struck him as curious and significant. Continuing to gaze into the box, he observed that all the persons in it treated Mihalevitch as an old friend. The performance on the stage ceased to interest Lavretsky, even Motchalov, though he was that evening in his “best form,” did not produce the usual impression on him. At one very pathetic part, Lavretsky involuntarily looked at his beauty: she was bending forward, her cheeks glowing under the influence of his persistent gaze, her eyes, which were fixed on the stage, slowly turned and rested on him. All night he was! haunted by those eyes. The skillfully constructed barriers were broken down at last; he was in a shiver and a fever, and the next day he went to Mihalevitch. From him he learnt that the name of the beauty was Varvara Pavlovna Korobyin; that the old people sitting with her in the box were her father and mother; and that he, Mihalevitch, had become acquainted with them a year before, while he was staying at Count N.‘s, in the position of a tutor, near Moscow. The enthusiast spoke in rapturous praise of Varvara Pavlovna. “My dear fellow,” he exclaimed with the impetuous ring in his voice peculiar to him, “that girl is a marvelous creature, a genius, an artist in the true sense of the word, and she is very good too.” Noticing from Lavretsky’s inquiries the impression Varvara Pavlovna had made on him, he himself proposed to introduce him to her, adding that he was like one of the family with them; that the general was not at all proud, and the mother was so stupid she could not say “Bo” to a goose. Lavretsky blushed, muttered something unintelligible, and ran away. For five whole days he was struggling with his timidity; on the sixth day the young Spartan got into a new uniform and placed himself at Mihalevitch’s disposal. The latter being his own valet, confined himself to combing his hair—and both betook themselves to the Korobyins."
"– Спасибо, брат, – промолвил Лаврецкий, – с меня будет этих неземных существ.","“Thank you, brother,” Lavretsky said, “these unearthly creatures will be with me.”","‘Thank you, my dear chap,’ Lavretsky said, ‘I’ve had enough of these heavenly creatures.’","“Thanks, brother,” remarked Lavretsky. “I have had quite enough of those heavenly creatures.”"
"– А Лизе за Паншиным не быть, не беспокойся; не такого мужа она стоит.","- But Lisa will not be after Panshin, do not worry; She is not worth the kind of husband.","‘Liza won’t be marrying Panshin, don’t you worry; he’s not the sort of husband she deserves.’",“And Lisa’s not going to marry Panshin; don’t you trouble yourself; that’s not the sort of husband she deserves.”
"– И вот что я хотела вам еще сказать, Федор Иваныч, – продолжала Марья Дмитриевна, слегка подвигаясь к нему, – если б вы видели, как она скромно себя держит, как почтительна! Право, это даже трогательно. А если б вы слышали, как она о вас отзывается! Я, говорит, перед ним кругом виновата; я, говорит, не умела ценить его, говорит; это, говорит, ангел, а не человек. Право, так и говорит: ангел. Раскаяние у ней такое… Я, ей-богу, и не видывала такого раскаяния!","“And this is what I wanted to tell you, Fyodor Ivanovich,” continued Marya Dmitrievna, moving slightly towards him, “if you could see how modestly she behaves, how respectful she is!” Indeed, it is even touching. And if you heard how she speaks of you! I, he says, is to blame in front of him; I, he says, did not know how to appreciate him, he says; this, he says, is an angel, not a man. That's right, he says so: an angel. She has such remorse... By God, I have never seen such remorse!","‘And I have something more to tell you, Fyodor Ivanych,’ continued Marya Dmitrievna, moving slightly closer to him, ‘– if only you’d seen how modestly she behaved, how respectfully! Truly, it was even touching. And if you’d heard what she said about you! I am wholly to blame, she said; I did not know how to appreciate him, she said; he’s an angel, not a man, she said. Truly, that is just what she said: an angel. Her repentance is such that… God is my witness, I’ve never seen such repentance!’","“And this is what I wanted to say to you besides, Fedor Ivanitch,” continued Marya Dmitrievna, moving slightly nearer up to him, “if you had seen the modesty of her behaviour, how respectful she is! Really, it is quite touching. And if you had heard how she spoke of you! I have been to blame towards him, she said, altogether; I did not know how to appreciate him , she said; he is an angel, she said, and not a man. Really, that is what she said—an angel. Her penitence is such... Ah, upon my word, I have never seen such penitence!”"
"На следующий день было воскресенье. Колокольный звон к ранней обедне не разбудил Лаврецкого – он не смыкал глаз всю ночь, – но напомнил ему другое воскресенье, когда он, по желанию Лизы, ходил в церковь. Он поспешно встал; какой-то тайный голос говорил ему, что он и сегодня увидит ее там же. Он без шума вышел из дома, велел сказать Варваре Павловне, которая еще спала, что он вернется к обеду, и большими шагами направился туда, куда звал его однообразно-печальный звон. Он пришел рано: почти никого еще не было в церкви; дьячок на клиросе читал часы; изредка прерываемый кашлем, голос его мерно гудел, то упадая, то вздуваясь. Лаврецкий поместился недалеко от входа. Богомольцы приходили поодиночке, останавливались, крестились, кланялись на все стороны; шаги их звенели в пустоте и тишине, явственно отзываясь под сводами. Дряхлая старушонка в ветхом капоте с капюшоном стояла на коленях подле Лаврецкого и прилежно молилась; ее беззубое, желтое, сморщенное лицо выражало напряженное умиление; красные глаза неотвратимо глядели вверх, на образа иконостаса; костлявая рука беспрестанно выходила из капота и медленно и крепко клала большой широкий крест. Мужик с густой бородой и угрюмым лицом, взъерошенный и измятый, вошел в церковь, разом стал на оба колена и тотчас же принялся поспешно креститься, закидывая назад и встряхивая голову после каждого поклона. Такое горькое горе сказывалось в его лице, во всех его движениях, что Лаврецкий решился подойти к нему и спросить его, что с ним. Мужик пугливо и сурово отшатнулся, посмотрел на него… «Сын помер», – произнес он скороговоркой и снова принялся класть поклоны… «Что для них может заменить утешения церкви?» – подумал Лаврецкий и сам попытался молиться; но сердце его отяжелело, ожесточилось, и мысли были далеко. Он все ждал Лизы – но Лиза не приходила. Церковь стала наполняться народом; ее все не было. Обедня началась, дьякон уже прочитал евангелие, зазвонили к достойной; Лаврецкий подвинулся немного вперед – и вдруг увидел Лизу. Она пришла раньше его, но он ее не заметил; прижавшись в промежуточек между стеной и клиросом, она не оглядывалась не шевелилась. Лаврецкий не свел с нее глаз до самого конца обедни: он прощался с нею. Народ стал расходиться, а она все стояла; казалось, она ожидала ухода Лаврецкого. Наконец она перекрестилась в последний раз и пошла, не оборачиваясь: с ней была одна горничная. Лаврецкий вышел вслед за ней из церкви и догнал ее на улице; она шла очень скоро, наклонив голову и спустив вуаль на лицо.","The next day was Sunday. The ringing of the bells for early mass did not wake Lavretsky—he did not close his eyes all night—but it reminded him of another Sunday, when, at Lisa's wish, he went to church. He hastily got up; some secret voice told him that he would see her there today too. He left the house without noise, told Varvara Pavlovna, who was still asleep, to tell him that he would be back for dinner, and with long strides went to where the monotonously sad ringing was calling him. He came early: there was almost no one else in the church; the deacon in the kliros read the clock; occasionally interrupted by a cough, his voice boomed measuredly, now falling, now swelling. Lavretsky was placed not far from the entrance. The pilgrims came one by one, stopped, crossed themselves, bowed in all directions; their steps rang in the emptiness and silence, clearly echoing under the vaults. A decrepit old woman in a shabby bonnet with a hood knelt beside Lavretsky and prayed earnestly; her toothless, yellow, wrinkled face expressed intense emotion; red eyes looked inexorably up at the images of the iconostasis; a bony hand constantly came out of the hood and slowly and firmly laid a large wide cross. A muzhik with a thick beard and a gloomy face, disheveled and crumpled, entered the church, fell on both knees at once and immediately began hastily crossing himself, throwing back and shaking his head after each bow. Such bitter grief was expressed in his face, in all his movements, that Lavretsky decided to go up to him and ask him what was the matter with him. The peasant recoiled timidly and sternly, looked at him... ""The son is dead,"" he said quickly, and again began to bow... ""What can replace the consolations of the church for them?"" thought Lavretsky, and he himself tried to pray; but his heart became heavy and hardened, and his thoughts were far away. He kept waiting for Liza, but Liza did not come. The church began to fill with people; she wasn't there. Mass began, the deacon had already read the gospel, the bell rang for the worthy; Lavretsky moved a little forward - and suddenly he saw Lisa. She arrived before him, but he did not notice her; nestled between the wall and the choir, she did not look back, did not move. Lavretsky did not take his eyes off her until the very end of mass: he was saying goodbye to her. The people began to disperse, but she still stood; she seemed to be expecting Lavretsky to leave. At last she made the sign of the cross for the last time and went on without turning round: there was only one maid with her. Lavretsky followed her out of the church and overtook her in the street; she walked very quickly with her head bowed and her veil drawn down over her face.","THE next day was Sunday. The sound of bells for early service did not waken Lavretsky – he had not closed his eyes all night – but reminded him of that other Sunday when he had gone to church on Liza’s wishes. He rose hurriedly; some secret voice told him that he would see her there again today. He left the house without a sound, having left word for Varvara Pavlovna, who was still sleeping, that he would return for dinner, and with big strides set off in the direction to which the monotonously sad ringing called him. He arrived early: hardly anyone was yet in the church; a deacon was reading prayers in the chancel; his voice, occasionally interrupted by bouts of coughing, rose and fell in its measured deep intoning of the words. Lavretsky positioned himself not far from the entrance. Worshippers arrived one by one, stopped, crossed themselves and bowed on all sides; their footsteps made a ringing sound in the emptiness and quiet, clearly echoing in the vaulted roof. A decrepit old woman in a threadbare coat with a hood kneeled by Lavretsky and prayed diligently; her toothless, yellow, wrinkled face expressed intense exultation; her reddened eyes gazed immovably up at the icons on the iconostasis; her bony hand ceaselessly emerged from her coat and slowly and firmly made the sign of the cross in broad, large gestures. A peasant with a thick beard and despondent face, dishevelled and crumpled, entered the church, fell at once on both knees and instantly began hurriedly crossing himself, throwing back and shaking his head after each obeisance. Such bitter sorrow was written in his face and expressed in all his movements that Lavretsky decided to approach him and ask what was wrong. The peasant started back sternly and in fright, and looked at him…. ‘My son has died’ he said in haste and again started making his obeisances. ‘What can replace for them the comfort of the church?’ thought Lavretsky and made his own attempt to pray; but his heart had become hard and embittered and his thoughts were far away. He kept on waiting for Liza, but Liza did not come. The church began to fill with people; still she wasn’t there. The service began, and the deacon had already read the gospel, the bell had rung for the final devotion, when Lavretsky moved a little forward – and suddenly he saw Liza. She had come earlier than him, but he had not noticed her; pressed into the little space between the wall and the chancel, she did not look round and did not move. Lavretsky did not take his eyes off her until the very end of the service: he was saying good-bye to her. The people began to disperse, but she still remained there, as if she was waiting for Lavretsky to leave. Finally she crossed herself for the last time and went out without turning round; she had a maid with her. Lavretsky followed her out of the church and caught up with her in the street; she was walking very fast, with her head bent forward and a veil over her face.","The following day was Sunday. The sound of bells ringing for early mass did not wake Lavretsky—he had not closed his eyes all night—but it reminded him of another Sunday, when at Lisa’s desire he had gone to church. He got up hastily; some secret voice told him that he would see her there to-day. He went noiselessly out of the house, leaving a message for Varvara Pavlovna that he would be back to dinner, and with long strides he made his way in the direction in which the monotonously mournful bells were calling him. He arrived early; there was scarcely any one in the church; a deacon was reading the service in the chair; the measured drone of his voice—sometimes broken by a cough—fell and rose at even intervals. Lavretsky placed himself not far from the entrance. Worshippers came in one by one, stopped, crossed themselves, and bowed in all directions; their steps rang out in the empty, silent church, echoing back distinctly under the arched roof. An infirm poor little old woman in a worn-out cloak with a hood was on her knees near Lavretsky, praying assiduously; her toothless, yellow, wrinkled face expressed intense emotion; her red eyes were gazing fixedly upwards at the holy figures on the iconostasis; her bony hand was constantly coming out from under her cloak, and slowly and earnestly making a great sign of the cross. A peasant with a bushy beard and a surly face, dishevelled and unkempt, came into the church, and at once fell on both knees, and began directly crossing himself in haste, bending back his head with a shake after each prostration. Such bitter grief was expressed in his face, and in all his actions, that Lavretsky made up his mind to go up to him and ask him what was wrong. The peasant timidly and morosely started back, looked at him.... “My son is dead,” he articulated quickly, and again fell to bowing to the earth. “What could replace the consolations of the Church to them?” thought Lavretsky; and he tried! himself to pray, but his heart was hard and heavy, and his thoughts were far away. He kept expecting Lisa, but Lisa did not come. The church began to be full of people; but still she was not there. The service commenced, the deacon had already read the gospel, they began ringing for the last prayer; Lavretsky moved a little forward—and suddenly caught sight of Lisa. She had com before him, but he had not seen her; she was hidden in a recess between the wall and the choir, and neither moved nor looked round. Lavretsky did not take his eyes off he till the very end of the service; he was saying farewell to her. The people began to disperse, but she still remained; it seemed as though she were waiting for Lavretsky to go out. At last she crossed herself for the last time and went out—there was only a maid with her—not turning round. Lavretsky went out of the church after her and overtook her in the street; she was walking very quickly, with downcast head, and a veil over her face."
"– Зачем оскорблять! – с усилием проговорила Лиза. Дрожь ее рук становилась видимой. – Вы сами ее оставили, Федор Иваныч.","Why insult! Lisa spoke with an effort. The trembling of her hands became visible. “You yourself left her, Fyodor Ivanovich.","‘How insulting to her!’ Liza said with an effort. Her hands were noticeably shaking. ‘You were the one who left her, Fyodor Ivanych.’","“Why abuse her?” Lisa articulated with an effort. The trembling of her hands was perceptible now. “You left her yourself, Fedor Ivanitch.”"
"Марья Дмитриевна слабо улыбнулась и протянула Гедеоновскому свою пухлую руку с отделенным пятым пальчиком. Он приложился к ней губами, а она пододвинула к нему свое кресло и, слегка нагнувшись, спросила вполголоса:","Marya Dmitrievna smiled weakly and held out her plump hand to Gedeonovsky, with the fifth finger severed. He kissed her lips, and she pulled her chair up to him and, bending slightly, asked in an undertone:","Marya Dmitrievna smiled faintly and extended to Gedeonovsky her plump hand with the little finger raised. He pressed his lips to it while she moved her chair towards him and, bending slightly forwards, asked in a low voice:","Marya Dmitrievna with a faint smile held out her plump hand to him with the little finger held apart from the rest.

"Казачок доложил о приходе Гедеоновского. Старый болтун вошел, отвешивая поклоны и ухмыляясь. Марья Дмитриевна представила его своей гостье. Он сперва было сконфузился; но Варвара Павловна так кокетливо-почтительно обошлась с ним, что у него ушки разгорелись, и выдумки, сплетни, любезности медом потекли с его уст. Варвара Павловна слушала его, сдержанно улыбалась и сама понемногу разговорилась. Она скромно рассказывала о Париже, о своих путешествиях, о Бадено; раза два рассмешила Марью Дмитриевну и всякий раз потом слегка вздыхала и как будто мысленно упрекала себя в неуместной веселости; выпросила позволение привести Аду; снявши перчатки, показывала своими гладкими, вымытыми мылом a la guimauve[39]руками, как и где носятся воланы, рюши, кружева, шу; обещалась принести стклянку с новыми английскими духами: Victoria's Essence[40] и обрадовалась, как дитя, когда Марья Дмитриевна согласилась принять ее в подарок; всплакнула при воспоминании о том, какое чувство она испытала, когда в первый раз услыхала русские колокола: «Так глубоко поразили они меня в самое сердце», – промолвила она. В это мгновенье вошла Лиза.","Kazachok reported on the arrival of Gedeonovsky. The old talker entered, bowing and grinning. Marya Dmitrievna introduced him to her guest. He was embarrassed at first; but Varvara Pavlovna treated him so coquettishly and respectfully that his ears flared up, and inventions, gossip, courtesies flowed like honey from his lips. Varvara Pavlovna listened to him, smiled discreetly, and gradually began talking herself. She talked modestly about Paris, about her travels, about Badeno; twice she made Marya Dmitrievna laugh, and each time afterwards she sighed slightly and seemed to mentally reproach herself for inappropriate gaiety; begged permission to bring Ada; taking off her gloves, she showed with her smooth, soapy hands a la guimauve[39] how and where flounces, ruffles, lace, shu are worn; promised to bring a glass of new English perfume: Victoria's Essence[40] and was delighted like a child when Marya Dmitrievna agreed to accept it as a gift; she wept at the memory of the feeling she had experienced when she first heard the Russian bells: “So deeply they struck me in the very heart,” she said. At that moment, Lisa entered.","A page-boy announced Gedeonovsky’s arrival. The old gossip entered, bowing low and smirking. Marya Dmitrievna introduced him to her guest. At first he made a show of being put out; but Varvara Pavlovna was so respectfully coquettish towards him that his ears turned a fiery red, and stories, gossip and compliments flowed like honey from his lips. Varvara Pavlovna listened to him, smiled with restraint and began gradually to join in the conversation. She spoke modestly about Paris, her travels and Baden; once or twice she made Marya Dmitrievna laugh and each time she sighed lightly afterwards and seemed mentally to scold herself for such inappropriate gaiety; she asked permission to bring Ada; after removing her gloves, she demonstrated with her smooth hands smelling of soap à la guimauve how and where flounces, frills, lace and choux were worn; she promised to bring a bottle of the new English scent, Victoria Essence2, and was as pleased as a child when Marya Dmitrievna agreed to accept it as a present; she grew tearful when she recalled what she had felt on hearing Russian church bells for the first time: ‘ So deeply they struck me, in my very heart,’ she murmured. At that instant Liza entered.","A page announced the arrival of Gedeonovsky. The old gossip came in bowing and smiling. Marya Dmitrievna presented him to her visitor. He was thrown into confusion for the first moment; but Varvara Pavlovna behaved with such coquettish respectfulness to him, that his ears began to tingle, and gossip, slander, and civility dropped like honey from his lips. Varvara Pavlovna listened to him with a restrained smile and began by degrees to talk herself. She spoke modestly of Paris, of her travels, of Baden; twice she made Marya Dmitrievna laugh, and each time she sighed a little afterwards, and seemed to be inwardly reproaching herself for misplaced levity. She obtained permission to bring Ada; taking off her gloves, with her smooth hands, redolent of soap a la guimauve, she showed how and where flounces were worn and ruches and lace and rosettes. She promised to bring a bottle of the new English scent, Victoria Essence; and was as happy as a child when Marya Dmitrievna consented to accept it as a gift. She was moved to tears over the recollection of the emotion she experienced, when, for the first time, she heard the Russian bells. “They went so deeply to my heart,” she explained. At that instant Lisa came in."
"– И ведь знает, плут, – перебила ее Марфа Тимофеевна, – знает, чем ее прельстить: табакерку ей подарил. Федя, попроси у ней табачку понюхать; ты увидишь, табакерка какая славная: на крышке гусар на коне представлен. Уж ты лучше, мать моя, не оправдывайся. Настасья Карповна только руками отмахивалась.","“And he knows, you rogue,” Marfa Timofeevna interrupted her, “he knows how to seduce her: he gave her a snuffbox.” Fedya, ask her to sniff some tobacco; you will see what a glorious snuffbox: on the lid is a hussar on horseback.

Nastasya Karpovna only waved her hands.","‘And he knows, the rascal does ,’ Marfa Timofeyevna interrupted her, ‘he knows what to flatter her with: he’s given her a little snuff-box.

You’d better not try to defend yourself, my dear.” Nastasya Karpovna could only fling up her hands."
"– Знаете ли, – шепнула она Варваре Павловне, – я хочу попытаться помирить, вас с вашим мужем; не отвечаю за успех, но попытаюсь. Он меня, вы знаете, очень уважает.","“You know,” she whispered to Varvara Pavlovna, “I want to try to reconcile you and your husband; I'm not responsible for success, but I'll try. He me, you know, very respects.","‘You know,’ she whispered to Varvara Pavlovna, ‘I want to try and reconcile you with your husband. I don’t guarantee success, but I will try.

"Но, видно, лицо у Лаврецкого было очень странно: старик сделал себе из руки над глазами козырек, вгляделся в своего ночного посетителя и впустил его.","But, evidently, Lavretsky's face was very strange: the old man made a visor from his hand over his eyes, peered at his nocturnal visitor, and let him in.","But evidently Lavretsky’s face had a strange look: the old man cupped a hand over his eyes, peered at his nocturnal visitor and admitted him.","But Lavretsky’s face, apparently, struck him as strange; the old man made a shade for his eyes with his hand, took a look at his elated visitor, and let him in."

"– Я сумею покориться, – возразила Варвара Павловна и склонила голову. – Я не забыла своей вины; я бы не удивилась, если бы узнала, что вы даже обрадовались известию о моей смерти, – кротко прибавила она, слегка указывая рукой на лежавший на столе, забытый Лаврецким нумер журнала.","""I'll be able to submit,"" objected Varvara Pavlovna, bowing her head. – I have not forgotten my guilt; I wouldn’t be surprised if I knew that you even rejoiced at the news of my death, ”she added meekly, pointing slightly with her hand at the number of the magazine lying on the table, forgotten by Lavretsky.","‘I will learn how to be submissive,’ Varvara Pavlovna responded and bowed her head. ‘I haven’t forgotten my guilt; I wouldn’t have been surprised if I’d learned that you even took delight in the news of my death,’ she added meekly, lightly indicating with her hand the newspaper lying forgotten on the table by Lavretsky.","“I know how to submit,” rejoined Varvara Pavlovna, bowing her head. “I have not forgotten my sin; I should not have been surprised if I had learnt that you even rejoiced at the news of my death,” she added softly, slightly pointing with her hand to the copy of the journal which was lying forgotten by Lavretsky on the table."
"– Ведь вас, кажется, зовут Елизаветой? – промолвил Лаврецкий, взбираясь по ступеням крыльца.","""Your name is Elizabeth, isn't it?"" said Lavretsky, climbing the steps of the porch.","‘It seems to me you’re called Elizaveta, aren’t you?’ Lavretsky asked, climbing the porch steps.","“Let me see, I think your name is Elisaveta?” said Lavretsky, as he went up the stairs."

"– Извините, пожалуйста, – проговорил Лаврецкий, – я… я не то хотел сказать, я пришел проститься с вами, я через час еду в деревню.","“Excuse me, please,” Lavretsky said, “I ... I didn’t mean to say that, I came to say goodbye to you, I’m going to the village in an hour.","‘Forgive me, please,’ said Lavretsky, ‘I… I didn’t mean that. I came to say good-bye to you because I’m leaving for the country in an hour.’","“I beg your pardon,” said Lavretsky; “I—I did not mean to say that; I have come to say good-bye to you, I am starting for my village in an hour.”"
"С утра, с самой той минуты, когда она, вся похолодев от ужаса, прочла записку Лаврецкого, Лиза готовилась к встрече с его женою; она предчувствовала, что увидит ее. Она решилась не избегать ее, в наказание своим, как она назвала их, преступным надеждам. Внезапный перелом в ее судьбе потряс ее до основания; в два каких-нибудь часа ее лицо похудело; но она и слезинки не проронила. «Поделом!», – говорила она самой себе, с трудом и волнением подавляя в душе какие-то горькие, злые, ее самое пугавшие порывы. «Ну, надо идти!» – подумала она, как только узнала о приезде Лаврецкой, и она пошла… Долго стояла она перед дверью гостиной, прежде чем решилась отворить ее; с мыслью «Я перед нею виновата» – переступила она порог и заставила себя посмотреть на нее, заставила себя улыбнуться. Варвара Павловна пошла ей навстречу, как только увидала ее, и склонилась перед ней слегка, но все-таки почтительно. «Позвольте мне рекомендовать себя, – заговорила она вкрадчивым голосом, – ваша maman так снисходительна ко мне, что я надеюсь, что и вы будете… добры». Выражение лица Варвары Павловны, когда она сказала это последнее слово, ее хитрая улыбка, холодный и в то же время мягкий взгляд, движение ее рук и плечей, самое ее платье, все ее существа – возбудили такое чувство отвращения в Лизе, что она ничего не могла ей ответить и через силу протянула ей руку. «Эта барышня брезгает мною», – подумала Варвара Павловна, крепко стискивая холодные пальцы Лизы и, обернувшись к Марье Дмитриевне, промолвила вполголоса: «Mais elle est delicieuse!»[41] Лиза слабо вспыхнула: насмешка, обида послышались ей в этом восклицании; но она решилась не верить своим впечатлениям и села к окну за пяльцы. Варвара Павловна и тут не оставила ее в покое: подошла к ней, начала хвалить ее вкус, ее искусство… Сильно и болезненно забилось сердце у Лизы: она едва переломила себя, едва усидела на месте. Ей казалось, что Варвара Павловна все знает и, тайно торжествуя, подтрунивает над ней. К счастью ее, Гедеоновский заговорил с Варварой Павловной и отвлек ее внимание. Лиза склонилась над пяльцами и украдкой наблюдала за нею. «Эту женщину, – думала она, – любил он». Но она тотчас же изгнала из головы самую мысль о Лаврецком: она боялась потерять власть над собою; она чувствовала, что голова у ней тихо кружилась. Марья Дмитриевна заговорила о музыке.","From the morning, from the very moment when, all cold with horror, she read Lavretsky's note, Liza prepared to meet his wife; she had a presentiment that she would see her. She decided not to avoid her, in punishment for her, as she called them, criminal hopes. A sudden change in her fate shook her to her foundations; in a matter of two hours her face lost weight; but she didn't shed a tear. “To serve you right!” she said to herself, with difficulty and excitement suppressing in her soul some bitter, evil impulses that frightened her most. ""Well, we must go!"" she thought, as soon as she learned of Lavretskaya's arrival, and she went... She stood for a long time in front of the drawing-room door before she decided to open it; with the thought “I am guilty before her” - she crossed the threshold and forced herself to look at her, forced herself to smile. Varvara Pavlovna went to meet her as soon as she saw her, and bowed slightly before her, but still respectfully. ""Let me recommend myself,"" she began in an insinuating voice, ""your maman is so indulgent towards me that I hope that you will be ... kind."" The expression on Varvara Pavlovna's face when she said this last word, her sly smile, her cold and at the same time soft look, the movement of her arms and shoulders, her very dress, all her beings - aroused such a feeling of disgust in Lisa that she did nothing could answer her and through force held out her hand to her. ""That young lady is squeamish about me,"" thought Varvara Pavlovna, firmly squeezing Lisa's cold fingers, and turning to Marya Dmitrievna, she said in an undertone: ""Mais elle est delicieuse!"" but she made up her mind not to believe her impressions and sat down at the frame by the window. Varvara Pavlovna did not leave her alone even here: she went up to her, began to praise her taste, her art ... Lisa's heart began to beat strongly and painfully: she could hardly break herself, she could hardly sit still. It seemed to her that Varvara Pavlovna knew everything and, secretly triumphant, teased her. Fortunately for her, Gedeonovsky spoke to Varvara Pavlovna and diverted her attention. Liza bent over the embroidery frame and furtively watched her. This woman, she thought, he loved. But she immediately drove the very thought of Lavretsky out of her head: she was afraid of losing power over herself; she felt her head spinning quietly. Marya Dmitrievna started talking about music.","Ever since the morning and that very moment when, cold with horror, she had read Lavretsky’s note, Liza had been preparing herself to meet his wife; she had a presentiment that she would see her. She had resolved not to avoid her, in punishment for her – as she called them – criminal hopes. The sudden crisis in her destiny had shaken her to the core; in no more than a couple of hours her face had grown thin; yet she had not shed a single tear. ‘It serves me right!’ she had told herself, suppressing excitedly and with difficulty certain bitter, malicious eruptions of feeling which frightened even her. ‘ Well, I must go,’ she thought, as soon as she heard of Mrs Lavretsky’s arrival, and go she did… She stood for a long while in front of the drawing-room door before she could make up her mind to open it; with the thought ‘I have wronged her’, she entered the room and forced herself to look at her, to smile at her. Varvara Pavlovna came towards her as soon as she saw her and bowed slightly, but nevertheless politely. ‘Allow me to introduce myself,’ she began ingratiatingly. ‘Your maman has been so gracious to me that I hope you will also be… kind.’ The expression on Varvara Pavlovna’s face when she said this last word, her insinuating smile, her cold and, at the same time, soft glance, the movement of her hands and shoulders, what she was wearing and her whole being aroused such a feeling of repugnance in Liza that she could not answer and it was with an effort that she stretched out her hand. ‘This young lady can’t stand me,’ thought Varvara Pavlovna, firmly pressing Liza’s cold fingers, and, turning to Marya Dmitrievna, she said in a low voice: ‘Mais elle est délicieuse!’ Liza coloured faintly at the mockery and insult which she heard in this exclamation; but she was determined not to trust her first impressions and sat down by the window with her embroidery. Varvara Pavlovna gave her no peace even there : she approached her, began praising her taste and her artistry…. Liza’s heart beat violently and sickeningly: she could hardly contain herself, hardly stay where she was. It seemed to her that Varvara Pavlovna knew everything and, secretly triumphant, was making fun of her. Luckily for her, Gedeonovsky began talking to Varvara Pavlovna and distracted her attention. Liza bent over her embroidery and covertly observed her. ‘This was the woman’, she thought, ‘that he loved.’ But she at once banished from her head all thought of Lavretsky, for she was frightened of losing control of herself and felt her head quietly spinning. Marya Dmitrievna started talking about music.","Ever since the morning, from the very instant when, chill with horror, she had read Lavretsky’s note, Lisa had been preparing herself for the meeting with his wife. She had a presentiment that she would see her. She resolved not to avoid her, as a punishment of her, as she called them, sinful hopes. The sudden crisis in her destiny had shaken her to the foundations. In some two hours her face seemed to have grown thin. But she did not shed a single tear. “It’s what I deserve!” she said to herself, repressing with difficulty and dismay some bitter impulses of hatred which frightened her in her soul. “Well, I must go down!” she thought directly she heard of Madame Lavretsky’s arrival, and she went down.... She stood a long while at the drawing-room door before she could summon up courage to open it. With the thought, “I have done her wrong,” she crossed the threshold and forced herself to look at her, forced herself to smile. Varvara Pavlovna went to meet her directly she caught sight of her, and bowed to her slightly, but still respectfully. “Allow me to introduce myself,” she began in an insinuating voice, “your maman is so indulgent to me that I hope that you too will be... good to me.” The expression of Varvara Pavlovna, when she uttered these last words, cold and at the same time soft, her hypocritical smile, the action of her hands, and her shoulders, her very dress, her whole being aroused such a feeling of repulsion in Lisa that she could make no reply to her, and only held out her hand with an effort. “This young lady disdains me,” thought Varvara Pavlovna, warmly pressing Lisa’s cold fingers, and turning to Marya Dmitrievna, she observed in an undertone, “mais elle est delicieuse!” Lisa faintly flushed; she heard ridicule, insult in this exclamation. But she resolved not to trust her impressions, and sat down by the window at her embroidery-frame. Even here Varvara Pavlovna did not leave her in peace. She began to admire her taste, her skill.... Lisa’s heart beat violently and painfully. She could scarcely control herself, she could scarcely sit in her place. It seemed to her that Varvara Pavlovna knew all, and was mocking at her in secret triumph. To her relief, Gedeonovsky began to talk to Varvara Pavlovna, and drew off her attention. Lisa bent over her frame, and secretly watched her. “ That woman,” she thought, “was loved by him.” But she at once drove away the very thought of Lavretsky; she was afraid of losing her control over herself, she felt that her head was going round. Marya Dmitrievna began to talk of music."
"Паншин счел девяносто и начал учтиво и спокойно брать взятки, с строгим и достойным выражением на лице. Так должны играть дипломаты; вероятно, так и он играл в Петербурге с каким-нибудь сильным сановником, которому желал внушить выгодное мнение о своей солидности и зрелости. «Сто один, сто два, черви, сто три», – мерно раздавался его голос, и Лаврецкий не мог понять, чем он звучал: укоризной или самодовольствием.","Panshin counted ninety and began politely and calmly taking bribes, with a stern and dignified expression on his face. This is how diplomats should play; probably, he played in Petersburg with some strong dignitary, whom he wanted to inspire a favorable opinion about his solidity and maturity. “One hundred and one, one hundred and two, worms, one hundred and three,” his voice sounded measuredly, and Lavretsky could not understand whether he sounded reproachful or self-satisfied.","Panshin totted his score up to ninety and then began politely and composedly taking tricks, with a stern and dignified expression on his face. That is how diplomats should play; no doubt he had played like that in St Petersburg with some powerful high-up whom he wished to impress with a good opinion of his solidity and maturity. ‘ A hundred and one, a hundred and two, hearts, a hundred and three,’ his voice resounded with monotonous regularity, and Lavretsky could not make up his mind whether it sounded reproachful or self-satisfied.","Panshin counted ninety, and began calmly and urbanely taking tricks with a severe and dignified expression of face. So it befits diplomatists to play; this was no doubt how he played in Petersburg with some influential dignitary, whom he wished to impress with a favourable opinion of his solidity and maturity. “A hundred and one, a hundred and two, hearts, a hundred and three,” sounded his voice in measured tones, and Lavretsky could not decide whether it had a ring of reproach or of self-satisfaction."
"– Как он чихал! – воскликнула Леночка, – и снова зазвенел неудержимый смех.","- How he sneezed!

"– А сверх того, вы все, вся ваша братия, – продолжал неугомонный Михалевич, – начитанные байбаки.

А то есть у нас такие господа – впрочем, я это говорю не на твой счет, – которые всю жизнь свою проводят в каком-то млении скуки, привыкают к ней, сидят в ней, как… как грыб в сметане, – подхватил Михалевич и сам засмеялся своему сравнению. – О, это мление скуки – гибель русских людей!

And that is, we have such gentlemen - however, I'm not talking about you at this expense - who spend their whole lives in some sort of awe of boredom, get used to it, sit in it like ... like a mushroom in sour cream, - Mikhalevich picked up and laughed at his own comparison. - Oh, this thrill of boredom - the death of the Russian people! The whole century is going to work a nasty bobak ...","‘But above all, you’re like all, all your gentry sort,’ continued the indefatigable Mikhalevich, ‘you’re all well-read layabouts.

Or there are some gents among us – however, I’m not saying this on your account – who spend their whole lives in an absolute ecstasy of boredom, who grow so used to it they wallow in it like… like a mushroom in sour cream.’ Mikhalevich burst out laughing at his own analogy. ‘Oh, this ecstasy of boredom is the ruin of the Russian people! The crass layabout spends his whole life making up his mind to start work…’","“And, besides that, you are all, all the tribe of you,” continued Mihalevitch, “cultivated loafers. You know which leg the German limps on , you know what’s amiss with the English and the French, and your pitiful culture goes to make it worse, your shameful idleness, your abominable inactivity is justified by it. Some are even proud of it: ‘I’m such a clever fellow,’ they say, ‘I do nothing, while these fools are in a fuss.’ Yes! and there are fine gentlemen among us— though I don’t say this as to you—who reduce their whole life to a kind of stupor of boredom, get used to it, live in it, like—like a mushroom in white sauce,” Mihalevitch added hastily, and he laughed at his own comparison. “Oh! this stupor of boredom is the ruin of Russians. Ours is the age for work, and the sickening loafer”..."

"Звуки замерли, и фигура старика в шлафроке, с раскрытой грудью и растрепанными волосами, показалась в окне.","The sounds died away, and the figure of an old man in a dressing gown, with open chest and disheveled hair, appeared in the window.","The sounds stopped and the figure of an old man in a nightshirt, bare-chested, with dishevelled hair, appeared in the window.","The sounds died away and the figure of the old man in a dressing-gown, with his throat bare and his hair dishevelled, appeared at the window."
"– Приказали очинно просить, – продолжал лакей, – приказали сказать, что они одни.","“They ordered me to ask politely,” the footman continued, “they ordered me to say that they were alone.","‘She said especial-like to ask,’ the footman went on. ‘ She said to say she was alone.’","“Her excellency told me to ask you very particularly,” continued the servant. “She gave orders to say she was at home.”"
"– Не надобно, – возразил старик с почти детской улыбкой. Два дня спустя Федор Иваныч отправился в город к Калитиным.","“No need,” said the old man with an almost childlike smile. Two days later Fyodor Ivanovich went to the city to the Kalitins.","‘Without Panshin,’ replied the old man with an almost childlike smile. Two days later Fyodor Ivanych set off for town to see the Kalitins.","“No, he isn’t wanted,” rejoined the old man with an almost child-like smile. Two days later Fedor Ivanitch set off to the town to see the Kalitins."
"– А по случаю бракосочетания господина Паншина с Лизой. Заметили ли вы, как он вчера за ней ухаживал? Кажется, у них уже все идет на лад.",- And on the occasion of the marriage of Mr. Panshin with Lisa. Did you notice how he courted her yesterday? They seem to be on the mend already.,‘The occasion of the marriage of Mr Panshin and Liza. Didn’t you notice how he was courting her yesterday? It seems that everything’s going along fine between them.’,“For the nuptials of Mr. Panshin and Lisa. Did you notice what attention he paid her yesterday? It seems as though things were in a fair way with them already.”

"Небольшой домик, куда приехал Лаврецкий и где два года тому назад скончалась Глафира Петровна, был выстроен в прошлом столетии, из прочного соснового леса; он на вид казался ветхим, но мог простоять еще лет пятьдесят или более. Лаврецкий обошел все комнаты и, к великому беспокойству старых, вялых мух с белой пылью на спине, неподвижно сидевших под притолоками, велел всюду открыть окна: с самой смерти Глафиры Петровны никто не отпирал их. Все в доме осталось, как было. Тонконогие белые диванчики в гостиной, обитые глянцевитым серым штофом, протертые и продавленные, живо напоминали екатерининские времена; в гостиной же стояло любимое кресло хозяйки, с высокой и прямой спинкой, к которой она и в старости не прислонялась. На главной стене висел старинный портрет Федорова прадеда, Андрея Лаврецкого; темное, желчное лицо едва отделялось от почерневшего и покоробленного фона; небольшие злые глаза угрюмо глядели из-под нависших, словно опухших век; черные волосы без пудры щеткой вздымались над тяжелым, изрытым лбом. На угле портрета висел венок из запыленных иммортелей. «Сами Глафира Петровна изволили плести», – доложил Антон. В спальне возвышалась узкая кровать, под пологом из стародавней, весьма добротной полосатой материи; горка полинялых подушек и стеганое жидкое одеяльце лежали на кровати, а у изголовья висел образ «Введение во храм пресвятой богородицы», – тот самый образ, к которому старая девица, умирая одна и всеми забытая, в последний раз приложилась уже хладеющими губами. Туалетный столик из штучного дерева, с медными бляхами и кривым зеркальцем, с почернелой позолотой, стоял у окна. Рядом с спальней находилась образная, маленькая комнатка, с голыми стенами и тяжелым киотом в угле; на полу лежал истертый, закапанный воском коверчик; Глафира Петровна клала на нем земные поклоны. Антон отправился с лакеем Лаврецкого отпирать конюшню и сарай; на место его явилась старушка, чуть ли не ровесница ему, повязанная платком по самые брови; голова ее тряслась и глаза глядели тупо, но выражали усердие, давнишнюю привычку служить безответно, и в то же время – какое-то почтительное сожаление. Она подошла к ручке Лаврецкого и остановилась у двери в ожидании приказаний. Он решительно не помнил, как ее звали, не помнил даже, видел ли ее когда-нибудь; оказалось, что ее звали Апраксеей; лет сорок тому назад та же Глафира Петровна сослала ее с барского двора и велела ей быть птичницей; впрочем, она говорила мало, словно из ума выжила, а глядела подобострастно. Кроме этих двух стариков да трех пузатых ребятишек в длинных рубашонках, Антоновых правнуков, жил еще на барском дворе однорукий бестягольный мужичонка; он бормотал, как тетерев, и не был способен ни на что; не многим полезнее его была дряхлая собака, приветствовавшая лаем возвращение Лаврецкого: она уже лет десять сидела на тяжелой цепи, купленной по распоряжению Глафиры Петровны, и едва-едва была в состоянии двигаться и влачить свою ношу. Осмотрев дом, Лаврецкий вышел в сад и остался им доволен. Он весь зарос бурьяном, лопухами, крыжовником и малиной; но в нем было много тени, много старых лип, которые поражали своею громадностью и странным расположением сучьев; они были слишком тесно посажены и когда-то – лет сто тому назад – стрижены. Сад оканчивался небольшим светлым прудом с каймой из высокого красноватого тростника. Следы человеческой жизни глохнут очень скоро: усадьба Глафиры Петровны не успела одичать, но уже казалась погруженной в ту тихую дрему, которой дремлет все на земле, где только нет людской, беспокойной заразы. Федор Иваныч прошелся также по деревне; бабы глядели на него с порогу своих изб, подпирая щеку рукою; мужики издали кланялись, дети бежали прочь, собаки равнодушно лаяли. Ему наконец захотелось есть; но он ожидал свою прислугу и повара только к вечеру; обоз с провизией из Лавриков еще не прибывал, – пришлось обратиться к Антону. Антон сейчас распорядился: поймал, зарезал и ощипал старую курицу; Апраксея долго терла и мыла ее, стирая ее, как белье, прежде чем положила ее в кастрюлю; когда она, наконец, сварилась, Антон накрыл и убрал стол, поставил перед прибором почерневшую солонку аплике о трех ножках и граненый графинчик с круглой стеклянной пробкой и узким горлышком; потом доложил Лаврецкому певучим голосом, что кушанье готово, – и сам стал за его стулом, обвернув правый кулак салфеткой и распространяя какой-то крепкий, древний запах, подобный запаху кипарисового дерева. Лаврецкий отведал супу и достал курицу; кожа ее была вся покрыта крупными пупырушками; толстая жила шла по каждой ноге, мясо отзывалось древесиной и щелоком. Пообедав, Лаврецкий сказал, что он выпил бы чаю, если… «Сею минуту-с подам-с», – перебил его старик – и сдержал свое обещание. Сыскалась щепотка чаю, завернутая в клочок красной бумажки; сыскался небольшой, но прерьяный и шумливый самоварчик, сыскался и сахар в очень маленьких, словно обтаявших кусках. Лаврецкий напился чаю из большой чашки; он еще с детства помнил эту чашку: игорные карты были изображены на ней, из нее пили только гости, – и он пил из нее, словно гость. К вечеру прибыла прислуга; Лаврецкому не захотелось лечь в теткиной кровати; он велел постлать себе постель в столовой. Погасив свечку, он долго глядел вокруг себя и думал невеселую думу; он испытывал чувство, знакомое каждому человеку, которому приходится в первый раз ночевать в давно необитаемом месте; ему казалось, что обступившая его со всех сторон темнота не могла привыкнуть к новому жильцу, что самые стены дома недоумевают. Наконец он вздохнул, натянул на себя одеяло и заснул. Антон дольше всех остался на ногах; он долго шептался с Апраксеей, охал вполголоса, раза два перекрестился; они оба не ожидали, чтобы барин поселился у них в Васильевском, когда у него под боком было такое славное именье с отлично устроенной усадьбой; они и не подозревали, что самая эта усадьба была противна Лаврецкому; она возбуждала в нем тягостные воспоминания. Нашептавшись вдоволь, Антон взял палку, поколотил по висячей, давно безмолвной доске у амбара и тут же прикорнул на дворе, ничем не прикрыв свою белую голову. Майская ночь была тиха и ласкова, – и сладко спалось старику.","The small house where Lavretsky arrived and where Glafira Petrovna died two years ago was built in the last century from a solid pine forest; it looked dilapidated, but could stand for another fifty years or more. Lavretsky went around all the rooms and, to the great anxiety of the old, sluggish flies with white dust on their backs, sitting motionless under the lintels, ordered the windows to be opened everywhere: since the death of Glafira Petrovna, no one had unlocked them. Everything in the house remained as it was. The thin-legged white sofas in the living room, upholstered in glossy gray damask, worn and dented, vividly recalled Catherine's times; in the drawing-room stood the mistress's favorite armchair, with a high and straight back, against which even in her old age she would not lean. On the main wall hung an old portrait of Fyodorov's great-grandfather, Andrey Lavretsky; the dark, bilious face was hardly separated from the blackened and warped background; small evil eyes looked sullenly from under hanging, as if swollen eyelids; her black, powderless hair rose like a brush over her heavy, pitted forehead. At the corner of the portrait hung a wreath of dusty immortels. “Glafira Petrovna herself deigned to weave,” Anton reported. In the bedroom rose a narrow bed, under a canopy of old-fashioned, very solid striped matter; a heap of faded pillows and a quilted liquid blanket lay on the bed, and at the head of the bed hung the image of the Entrance into the Temple of the Most Holy Theotokos, the same image to which the old maid, dying alone and forgotten by everyone, kissed her cold lips for the last time. A dressing table made of piece wood, with brass plaques and a curved mirror, with blackened gilding, stood by the window. Next to the bedroom was a figurative, small room, with bare walls and a heavy icon-case in the corner; on the floor lay a worn, wax-stained rug; Glafira Petrovna bowed to the ground on him. Anton went with Lavretsky's footman to unlock the stable and the shed; in his place appeared an old woman, almost the same age as him, tied with a handkerchief to the very eyebrows; her head was shaking and her eyes looked dull, but they expressed zeal, a long-standing habit of serving unrequitedly, and at the same time some kind of respectful regret. She went up to Lavretsky's hand and stood at the door waiting for orders. He absolutely did not remember her name, did not even remember if he had ever seen her; it turned out that her name was Apraksey; about forty years ago the same Glafira Petrovna exiled her from the manor's court and ordered her to be a bird-keeper; however, she spoke little, as if out of her mind, and looked obsequiously. In addition to these two old men and three pot-bellied children in long shirts, Antonov's great-grandchildren, there also lived in the manor's yard a one-armed, taxless peasant; he muttered like a black grouse and was incapable of anything; not much more useful than him was the decrepit dog, which greeted Lavretsky's return with a bark: for ten years now it had been sitting on a heavy chain bought on the orders of Glafira Petrovna, and was barely able to move and drag its burden. After examining the house, Lavretsky went out into the garden and was pleased with it. It is all overgrown with weeds, burdock, gooseberries and raspberries; but there was a lot of shade in it, a lot of old lindens, which struck with their immensity and the strange arrangement of the boughs; they were too closely planted and once - about a hundred years ago - sheared. The garden ended in a small light pond with a border of tall reddish reeds. The traces of human life will fade away very soon: Glafira Petrovna's estate did not have time to become wild, but already seemed immersed in that quiet slumber, which slumbers everything on earth, where there is only no human, restless infection. Fyodor Ivanitch also walked around the village; the women looked at him from the threshold of their huts, propping their cheeks with their hands; the peasants bowed from a distance, the children ran away, the dogs barked indifferently. He was finally hungry; but he expected his servant and cook only towards evening; The convoy with provisions from Lavrikov had not yet arrived, so I had to turn to Anton. Anton now ordered: he caught, slaughtered and plucked an old hen; Apraksey rubbed and washed it for a long time, washing it like linen, before putting it into the pan; when it was finally cooked, Anton covered and cleared the table, placed in front of the appliance a blackened salt shaker with three legs and a faceted decanter with a round glass stopper and a narrow neck; then he reported to Lavretsky in a melodious voice that the food was ready, and he himself stood behind his chair, wrapping a napkin around his right fist and spreading some strong, ancient smell, like the smell of a cypress tree. Lavretsky tasted the soup and brought out the chicken; her skin was all covered with large pimples; a thick vein ran down each leg, the meat reeked of wood and lye. After dinner, Lavretsky said that he would drink tea if ... ""I'll give you a minute,"" the old man interrupted him, and he kept his promise. A pinch of tea was found, wrapped in a piece of red paper; a small, but intermittent and noisy samovar was found, and sugar was found in very small, as if melted pieces. Lavretsky drank tea from a large cup; he remembered this cup from childhood: gambling cards were depicted on it, only guests drank from it, and he drank from it like a guest. By evening the servants arrived; Lavretsky did not want to lie down in his aunt's bed; he had his bed made up in the dining-room. Having extinguished the candle, he looked around him for a long time and thought a gloomy thought; he experienced a feeling familiar to every person who has to spend the night for the first time in a long uninhabited place; it seemed to him that the darkness surrounding him on all sides could not get used to the new tenant, that the very walls of the house were perplexed. Finally, he sighed, pulled the covers over himself, and fell asleep. Anton stayed on his feet the longest; he whispered to Apraksya for a long time, groaned in an undertone, crossed himself twice; they both did not expect the master to settle with them in Vasilyevsky, when he had such a glorious estate with a well-arranged estate near him; they did not even suspect that this very estate was disgusting to Lavretsky; it brought back painful memories in him. Having whispered to his heart's content, Anton took a stick, pounded on a hanging, long silent board by the barn, and immediately crouched down in the yard, not covering his white head with anything. The May night was quiet and gentle, and the old man slept soundly.","THE small house to which Lavretsky had come and where two years ago Glafira Petrovna had died was built in the last century of solid pinewood; in appearance it seemed decrepit, but it could well stand another fifty years or more. Lavretsky went through all the rooms and, to the great discomfort of the ancient, enfeebled flies with their backs covered in white dust who were sitting motionless under the lintels, ordered that all the windows should be opened: from the moment of Glafira Petrovna’s death no one had unlatched them. Everything in the house had remained as it was. In the drawing-room little white divans standing on elegant legs and upholstered in sheeny grey damask, frayed and holed, were a lively reminder of the times of Catherine1; there also stood the mistress’s favourite armchair with its high straight back, against which she did not lean even in old age. On the main wall hung an ancient portrait of Fyodor’s great-grandfather, Andrey Lavretsky; the dark, bad-tempered face was scarcely distinguishable from the warped and blackened background; small malicious eyes gazed morosely from beneath drooping and literally swollen lids; black unpowdered hair rose in bristles above a heavy furrowed brow. On one corner of the portrait hung a dusty wreath of everlasting flowers. ‘ Glafira Petrovna herself saw to the making of the wreath,’ Anton announced. In the bedroom stood a lofty narrow bed under a canopy of old-fashioned but very good-quality striped material; a pile of faded pillows and a threadbare quilted counterpane lay on the bed, at the head of which hung an icon, ‘The Blessed Virgin entering the Temple’ – the very same icon to which the old maiden lady, dying alone and forgotten by the world, pressed her already cold lips for the last time. By the window stood a little inlaid dressing-table with brass fittings and a crooked mirror in a tarnished gilt frame. Next to the bedroom was an icon-room, a tiny place with bare walls and a heavy icon-case set in one corner; on the floor lay a worn, wax-stained piece of carpet where Glafira Petrovna used to make her obeisances. Anton left with Lavretsky’s servant to unlock the stables and coach-house; in his place there appeared an old woman, almost his coeval, with a kerchief bound round her head to the level of her eyebrows; her head shook and her eyes stared vacantly, but she still contrived to express diligence, the long-term habit of unquestioning service and – at the same time – a kind of respectful regret. She approached Lavretsky’s hand and then stopped by the door in anticipation of orders. He simply could not remember what she was called, and did not even remember whether he had ever seen her before; it transpired that she was called Apraxia; some forty years ago Glafira Petrovna had despatched her from the house and ordered her to be a poultry-keeper; she spoke little, as if she had outlived her wits, but still gazed at him deferentially. Apart from these two old people and three pot-bellied children in long shirts, Anton’s great-grandchildren, there also lived at the house a little one-armed peasant who had been released from his obligations as a serf; he groused away to himself all day and was incapable of doing a thing; hardly more useful was the decrepit dog that had greeted Lavretsky’s return with its barking: it had spent ten years on a heavy chain bought on Glafira Petrovna’s orders and was barely in any condition to move about and drag its heavy burden. Having looked over the house, Lavretsky went into the garden and was satisfied by what he saw. It was entirely overgrown with thick weeds and burdock and gooseberry and raspberry bushes; but there was much shade and many old limes which were striking for their hugeness and the curious arrangements of their boughs, the result of having been planted too close together and – perhaps a hundred years ago – severely pruned back. The garden ended in a small bright pond with a fringe of tall reddish reeds. Traces of human life vanish very quickly: Glafira Petrovna’s estate had not yet gone wild, but it seemed already to have sunk into that quiet repose which possesses everything on earth wherever there is no restless human infection to affect it. Fyodor Ivanych also took a walk through the village; women gazed at him from the doorways of their huts, hands resting on their cheeks; the menfolk bowed from a distance, children ran off and dogs barked indifferently. Finally he wanted to have a meal, but he could not expect the rest of his servants and his cook before evening, and the waggons with supplies from Lavriki had not yet arrived – so he had to fall back on Anton. Anton at once made the arrangements: he caught, killed and plucked an old chicken; Apraxia took a long time rubbing and washing and belabouring it, as though it were linen, before putting it in a saucepan; when it was at last cooked, Anton spread a cloth and laid the table, setting before his master’s place a blackened plated salt-cellar on three legs and a cut-glass decanter with a round glass stopper and a thin neck; then he announced to Lavretsky in a sing-song voice that dinner was served and positioned himself behind Lavretsky’s chair with a napkin wrapped round his right fist and exuding a strong antique odour similar to that of cypress wood. Lavretsky dealt with the soup and then addressed himself to the chicken ; its skin was covered all over with large pimples; a large tendon ran down each leg and the meat had an alkaline, woody taste. Having dined, Lavretsky said that he would like some tea if… ‘I’ll bring it, sir, this very minute, sir,’ the old man interrupted and was as good as his word. A pinch of tea was sought out, wrapped in a twist of red paper; a small but exceedingly fiery and noisy samovar was unearthed, along with sugar in very small lumps which looked as if they had been melted. Lavretsky drank his tea from a big cup; he remembered this cup from his childhood: it had playing cards painted on it and only guests were allowed to drink out of it – and he drank out of it now as if he were a guest. His servants arrived towards evening; Lavretsky did not want to sleep in his aunt’s bed; he ordered that a bed be made up for him in the dining-room. When he had put out the candle he gazed around him for a long while and thought unhappy thoughts; he experienced the feeling, familiar to anyone who has had to spend a night for the first time in a long uninhabited place, that the darkness surrounding him on all sides could not, as it were, accustom itself to this new inhabitant, that the very walls of the house were baffled by him. Eventually he sighed, drew the blanket over him and fell asleep. Anton remained on his feet longer than anyone else; he spent a long time whispering with Apraxia, groaning under his breath and crossing himself a couple of times; neither of them had expected that the master would settle in Vasilyevskoye when he had nearby such a splendid estate with an admirably laid-out house and garden; they did not suspect that that very estate was repugnant to Lavretsky and aroused in him nothing but oppressive memories. Having whispered to his heart’s content, Anton took a stick and struck the watchman’s board which had long hung silent by the barn, and huddled down then and there out in the yard, without bothering to cover his white head. The May night was quiet and mild, and the old man slept sweetly.","The small manor-house to which Lavretsky had come and in which two years before Glafira Petrovna had breathed her last, had been built in the preceding century of solid pine-wood; it looked ancient, but it was still strong enough to stand another fifty years or more. Lavretsky made the tour of all the rooms, and to the great discomfiture of the aged languid flies, settled under the lintels and covered with white dust, he ordered the windows to be opened everywhere; they had not been opened ever since the death of Glafira Petrovna. Everything in the house had remained as it was; the thin-legged white miniature couches in the drawing-room, covered with glossy grey stuff, threadbare and rickety, vividly suggested the days of Catherine; in the drawing-room, too, stood the mistress’s favourite arm-chair, with high straight back, against which she never leaned even in her old age. On the principal wall hung a very old portrait of Fedor’s great-grandfather, Andrey Lavretsky; the dark yellow face was scarcely distinguishable from the warped and blackened background; the small cruel eyes looked grimly out from beneath the eyelids, which dropped as if they were swollen; his black unpowdered hair rose bristling above his heavy indented brow. In the corner of the portrait hung a wreath of dusty immortelles. “Glafira Petrovna herself was pleased to make it,” Anton announced. In the bedroom stood a narrow bedstead, under a canopy of old-fashioned and very good striped material; a heap of faded cushions and a thin quilted counterpane lay on the bed, and at the head hung a picture of the Presentation in the Temple of the Holy Mother of God; it was the very picture which the old maid, dying alone and forgotten by every one, had for the last time pressed to her chilling lips. A little toilet table of inlaid wood, with brass fittings and a warped looking-glass in a tarnished frame stood in the window. Next to the bedroom was the little ikon room with bare walls and a heavy case of holy images in the corner; on the floor lay a threadbare rug spotted with wax; Glafira Petrovna used to pray bowing to the ground upon it. Anton went away with Lavretsky ’s groom to unlock the stable and coach-house; to replace him appeared an old woman of about the same age, with a handkerchief tied round to her very eyebrows; her head shook, and her eyes were dim, but they expressed zeal, the habit of years of submissive service, and at the same time a kind of respectful commiseration. She kissed Lavretsky’s hand and stood still in the doorway awaiting his orders. He positively could not recollect her name and did not even remember whether he had ever seen her. Her name, it appeared, was Apraxya; forty years before, Glafira Petrovna had put her out of the master’s house and ordered that she should be a poultry woman. She said little, however; she seemed to have lost her senses from old age, and could only gaze at him obsequiously. Besides these two old creatures and three pot-bellied children in long smocks, Anton’s great-grandchildren, there was also living in the manor-house a one-armed peasant, who was exempted from servitude; he muttered like a woodcock and was of no use for anything. Not much more useful was the decrepit dog who had saluted Lavretsky’s return by its barking; he had been for ten years fastened up by a heavy chain, purchased at Glafira Petrovna’s command, and was scarcely able to move and drag the weight of it. Having looked over the house, Lavretsky went into the garden and was very much pleased with it. It was all overgrown with high grass, and burdock, and gooseberry and raspberry bushes, but there was plenty of shade, and many old lime-trees, which were remarkable for their immense size and the peculiar growth of their branches; they had been planted too close and at some time or other—a hundred years before—they had been lopped. At the end of the garden was a small clear pool bordered with high reddish rushes. The traces of human life very quickly! pass away; Glafira Petrovna’s estate had not had time to become quite wild, but already it seemed plunged in that quiet slumber in which everything reposes on earth where there is not the infection of man’s restlessness. Fedor Ivanitch walked also through the village; the peasant-women stared at him from the doorways of their huts, their cheeks resting on their hands; the peasants saluted him from a distance, the children ran out, and the dogs barked indifferently. At last he began to feel hungry; but he did not expect his servants and his cook till the evening; the waggons of provisions from Lavriky had not come yet, and he had to have recourse to Anton. Anton arranged matters at once; he caught, killed, and plucked an old hen; Apraxya gave it a long rubbing and cleaning, and washed it like linen before putting it into the stew-pan; when, at last, it was cooked Anton laid the cloth and set the table, placing beside the knife and fork a three-legged salt-cellar of tarnished plate and a cut decanter with a round glass stopper and a narrow neck; then he announced to Lavretsky in a sing-song voice that the meal was ready, and took his stand behind his chair, with a napkin twisted round his right fights, and diffusing about him a peculiar strong ancient odour, like the scent of a cypress-tree. Lavretsky tried the soup, and took out the hen; its skin was all covered with large blisters; a tough tendon ran up each leg; the meat had a flavour of wood and soda. When he had finished dinner, Lavretsky said that he would drink a cup of tea, if—“I will bring it this minute,” the old man interrupted. And he kept his word. A pinch of tea was hunted up, twisted in a screw of red paper; a small but very fiery and loudly-hissing samovar was found, and sugar too in small lumps, which looked as if they were thawing. Lavretsky drank tea out of a large cup; he remembered this cup from childhood; there were playing-cards depicted upon it, only visitors used to drink out of it—and here was he drinking out if like a visitor. In the evening his servants came; Lavretsky did not care to sleep in his aunt’s bed; he directed them put him up a bed in the dining-room. After extinguishing his candle he stared for a long time about him and feel into cheerless reflection; he experienced that feeling which every man knows whose lot it is to pass the night in a place long uninhabited; it seemed to him that the darkness surrounding him on all sides could not be accustomed to the new inhabitant, the very walls of the house seemed amazed. At last he sighed, drew up the counterpane round him and fell asleep. Anton remained up after all the rest of the household; he was whispering a long while with Apraxya, he sighed in an undertone, and twice he crossed himself; they had neither of them expected that their master would settle among them at Vassilyevskoe when he had not far off such a splendid estate with such a capitally built house; they did not suspect that the very house was hateful to Lavretsky; it stirred painful memories within him. Having gossiped to his heart’s content, Anton took a stick and struck the night watchman’s board, which had hung silent for so many years, and laid down to sleep in the courtyard with no covering on his white head. The May night was mild and soft, and the old man slept sweetly."

"– Гм, либретто! – возразил Лемм, – нет, это не по мне: у меня уже нет той живости, той игры вооброжения, которая необходима для оперы; я уже теперь лишился сил моих… Но если б я мог еще что-нибудь сделать, я бы удовольствовался романсом; конечно, я желал бы хороших слов… Он умолк и долго сидел неподвижно и подняв глаза на небо.","- Hmm, libretto!

"– Нет, тетушка, – промолвила она, – не говорите так; я решилась, я молилась, я просила совета у бога; все кончено, кончена моя жизнь с вами. Такой урок недаром; да я уж не в первый раз об этом думаю. Счастье ко мне не шло; даже когда у меня были надежды на счастье, сердце у меня все щемило. Я все знаю, и свои грехи, и чужие, и как папенька богатство наше нажил; я знаю все. Все это отмолить, отмолить надо. Вас мне жаль, жаль мамаши, Леночки; но делать нечего; чувствую я, что мне не житье здесь; я уже со всем простилась, всему в доме поклонилась в последний раз; отзывает меня что-то; тошно мне, хочется мне запереться навек.

I know everything, both my own sins and those of others, and how papa amassed our wealth; I know everything. All this must be prayed for, it must be prayed for. I feel sorry for you, sorry for your mother, Lenochka; but there is nothing to do; I feel that I cannot live here; I have already said goodbye to everything, bowed to everything in the house for the last time; something calls me back; I feel sick, I want to lock myself up forever.

I am sorry for you and for mama and for Lenochka; but it can’t be helped; I feel there is no life for me here. I’ve already said good-bye to everything, said my last good-byes to everything in the house; something is calling me away, and I feel sick of it all and I want to lock myself away for ever.

"Лаврецкий поехал в Васильевское; но и четырех дней там не выжил, – так ему показалось скучно. Его томило также ожидание: известие, сообщенное г-м Жюлем, требовало подтверждения, а он не получал никаких писем. Он вернулся в город и просидел вечер у Калитиных. Ему легко было заметить, что Марья Дмитриевна была против него восстановлена; но ему удалось несколько умилостивить ее, проиграв ей рублей пятнадцать в пикет, и он провел около получаса почти наедине с Лизой, несмотря на то, что мать ей еще накануне советовала не быть слишком фамильярной с человеком «qui a un si grand ridicule»[22]. Он нашел в ней перемену: она стала как будто задумчивее, попеняла ему за его отсутствие и спросила его: не пойдет ли он на другой день к обедне? (На другой день было воскресенье.)","Lavretsky went to Vasilyevskoye; but he didn’t survive even four days there, it seemed so boring to him. He was also tormented by expectation: the news communicated by M. Jules required confirmation, and he did not receive any letters. He returned to the city and spent the evening with the Kalitins. It was easy for him to notice that Marya Dmitrievna had been set against him; but he succeeded in appeasing her somewhat by losing fifteen rubles to her in a piquet, and he spent about half an hour almost alone with Liza, despite the fact that her mother had advised her the day before not to be too familiar with the man ""qui a un si grand ridicule""[22 ]. He found a change in her: she seemed to become more thoughtful, reproached him for his absence and asked him: would he not go to mass the next day? (The next day was Sunday.)","Lavretsky drove to Vasilyevskoye; but he was there less than four days – it seemed to him so boring. He was fretted also by expectation: the news given by M.

It was easy for him to see that Marya Dmitrievna was ranged against him; but he succeeded in ingratiating himself with her to some extent by losing fifteen roubles to her at picquet, and he spent about half an hour almost alone with Liza despite the fact that her mother had advised her the previous day not to be too familiar with someone ‘qui a un si grand ridicule’.

"– Ну, все-таки, отчего же не попробовать? Не отчаивайтесь, – возразила Марья Дмитриевна и хотела потрепать ее по щеке, но взглянула ей в лицо – и оробела. «Скромна, скромна, – подумала она, – а уж точно львица».","“Well, anyway, why not try? Don't despair, objected Marya Dmitrievna, and she wanted to pat her on the cheek, but she looked into her face and became timid. Modest, modest, she thought, and certainly a lioness.","‘Well, still, is there any harm in trying?

"Лаврецкий действительно не походил на жертву рока. От его краснощекого, чисто русского лица, с большим белым лбом, немного толстым носом и широкими правильными губами, так и веяло степным здоровьем, крепкой, долговечной силой. Сложен он был на славу, и белокурые волосы вились на его голове, как у юноши. В одних только его глазах, голубых, навыкате и несколько неподвижных, замечалась не то задумчивость, не то усталость, и голос его звучал как-то слишком ровно.","Lavretsky really did not look like a victim of fate. From his red-cheeked, purely Russian face, with a large white forehead, a slightly thick nose and wide, regular lips, one breathed of steppe health, strong, durable strength. He was well built, and his blond hair curled around his head like a young man's. In his eyes alone, blue, bulging and somewhat motionless, one could notice either thoughtfulness or fatigue, and his voice sounded somehow too even.","In fact, Lavretsky bore no resemblance to a victim of fate. His red-cheeked, very Russian face, with the large white forehead, slightly thick nose and broad regular lips, literally exuded the healthy life of the steppes and a powerful, durable strength. He had a magnificent build, and his fair hair curled on his head like a boy’s. Only in his blue, protruding and rather immobile eyes could be discerned a cross between pensiveness and tiredness, and his voice somehow sounded a little too smooth.","Lavretsky certainly did not look like the victim of fate. His rosy-cheeked typical Russian face, with its large white brow, rather thick nose, and wide straight lips seemed breathing with the wild health of the steppes, with vigorous primaeval energy. He was splendidly well-built, and his fair curly hair stood up on his head like a boy’s. It was only in his blue eyes, with their overhanging brows and somewhat fixed look, that one could trace an expression, not exactly of melancholy, nor exactly of weariness, and his voice had almost too measured a cadence."
– Сильфида! – воскликнул Гедеоновский.,- Sylph! exclaimed Gedeonovsky.,‘Sylph-like!’ exclaimed Gedeonovsky.,“Sylphide!” cried Gedeonovsky.
"Марьи Дмитриевны отзывалось о Васильевском, и потом, по обыкновению своему, ловко перейдя к самому себе, начал говорить о своих занятиях, о воззрениях своих на жизнь, на свет и на службу; сказал слова два о будущности России, о том, как следует губернаторов в руках держать; тут же весело подтрунил над самим собою и прибавил, что, между прочим, ему в Петербурге поручили «de populariser l'idee du cadastre»[19]. Он говорил довольно долго, с небрежной самоуверенностью разрешая все затруднения и, как фокусник шарами, играя самыми важными административными и политическими вопросами. Выражения: «Вот что бы я сделал, если б я был правительством»; «Вы, как умный человек, тотчас со мной согласитесь», – не сходили у него с языка. Лаврецкий холодно слушал разглагольствования Паншина: не нравился ему этот красивый, умный и непринужденно изящный человек, с своей светлой улыбкой, вежливым голосом и пытливыми глазами. Паншин скоро догадался, с свойственным ему быстрым пониманием ощущений другого, что не доставляет особенного удовольствия своему собеседнику, и под благовидным предлогом скрылся, решив про себя, что Лаврецкий, может быть, и прекрасный человек, но несимпатичный, «aigri»[20] и, «en somme»[21], несколько смешной. Марья Дмитриевна появилась в сопровождении Гедеоновского; потом пришла Марфа Тимофеевна с Лизой, за ними пришли остальные домочадцы; потом приехала и любительница музыки, Беленицына, маленькая, худенькая дама, с почти ребяческим, усталым и красивым личиком, в шумящем черном платье, с пестрым веером и толстыми золотыми браслетами; приехал и муж ее, краснощекий, пухлый человек с большими ногами и руками, с белыми ресницами и неподвижной улыбкой на толстых губах; в гостях жена никогда с ним не говорила, а дома, в минуты нежности, называла его своим поросеночком; Паншин вернулся: очень стало людно и шумно в комнатах. Лаврецкому такое множество народа было не по нутру; особенно сердила его Беленицына, которая то и дело глядела на него в лорнет. Он бы тотчас ушел, если б не Лиза: ему хотелось сказать ей два слова наедине, но он долго не мог улучить удобное мгновенье и довольствовался тем, что с тайной радостью следил за нею взором; никогда ее лицо не казалось ему благородней и милей. Она много выигрывала от близости Беленицыной. Та беспрестанно двигалась на стуле, поводила своими узкими плечиками, смеялась изнеженным смехом и то щурилась, то вдруг широко раскрывала глаза. Лиза сидела смирно, глядела прямо и вовсе не смеялась. Хозяйка села играть в карты с Марфой Тимофеевной, Беленицыным и Гедеоновским, который играл очень медленно, беспрестанно ошибался, моргал глазами и утирал лицо платком. Паншин принял меланхолический вид, выражался кратко, многозначительно и печально, – ни дать ни взять невыказавшийся художник, – но, несмотря на просьбы Беленицыной, которая очень с ним кокетничала, не соглашался спеть свой романс: Лаврецкий его стеснял. Федор Иваныч тоже говорил мало, особенное выражение его лица поразило Лизу, как только он вошел в комнату: она тотчас почувствовала, что он имеет сообщить ей что-то, но, сама не зная почему, боялась расспросить его. Наконец, переходя в залу наливать чай, она невольно поворотила голову в его сторону. Он тотчас пошел вслед за ней.","Marya Dmitrievna spoke of Vasilyevsky, and then, as usual, deftly turning to himself, he began to talk about his studies, about his views on life, on the world and on service; said a couple of words about the future of Russia, about how governors should be held in hand; he immediately joked merrily with himself and added that, by the way, he was entrusted in Petersburg with ""de populariser l'idee du cadastre""[19]. He talked for a long time, with careless self-confidence resolving all difficulties and, like a conjurer with balls, playing with the most important administrative and political questions. Expressions: ""This is what I would do if I were the government""; “You, as an intelligent person, will immediately agree with me,” he did not leave his tongue. Lavretsky listened coldly to Panshin's rantings: he did not like this handsome, intelligent, and effortlessly graceful man, with his bright smile, polite voice, and inquisitive eyes. Panshin soon guessed, with his characteristic quick understanding of the sensations of another, that he did not give special pleasure to his interlocutor, and under a plausible pretext disappeared, deciding to himself that Lavretsky, perhaps, was a wonderful person, but unsympathetic, ""aigri""[20] and , ""en somme""[21], somewhat funny. Marya Dmitrievna appeared accompanied by Gedeonovsky; then Marfa Timofeyevna came with Liza, followed by the rest of the household; then came the lover of music, Belenitsyna, a small, thin lady, with an almost childish, tired and beautiful face, in a noisy black dress, with a motley fan and thick gold bracelets; her husband also arrived, a ruddy-cheeked, chubby man with big legs and arms, with white eyelashes and a motionless smile on his thick lips; when visiting, his wife never spoke to him, but at home, in moments of tenderness, she called him her little pig; Panshin returned: it became very crowded and noisy in the rooms. Lavretsky did not like such a multitude of people; Belenitsyna, who kept looking at him through her lorgnette, was especially angry with him. He would have left at once if it had not been for Liza: he wanted to say a few words to her in private, but for a long time he could not seize a convenient moment and was content with following her with secret joy with his eyes; never had her face seemed nobler and sweeter to him. She benefited a lot from the proximity of Belenitsyna. She moved incessantly in her chair, wiggled her narrow shoulders, laughed with a pampered laugh, and then screwed up her eyes, then suddenly opened her eyes wide. Liza sat quietly, looked straight ahead, and did not laugh at all. The hostess sat down to play cards with Marfa Timofeyevna, Belenitsyn, and Gedeonovsky, who played very slowly, constantly making mistakes, blinking his eyes, and wiping his face with a handkerchief. Panshin took on a melancholy air, expressed himself briefly, meaningfully and sadly - the artist who did not show himself, for whatever reason - but, despite the requests of Belenitsyna, who was very flirtatious with him, did not agree to sing his romance: Lavretsky embarrassed him. Fyodor Ivanitch also spoke little; the peculiar expression of his face struck Liza as soon as he entered the room: she immediately felt that he had something to tell her, but, not knowing why herself, she was afraid to question him. Finally, going into the hall to pour tea, she involuntarily turned her head in his direction. He immediately followed her.","Panshin began with compliments, describing the enthusiasm with which, in his own words, Marya Dmitrievna’s entire family had spoken about Vasilyevskoye, and then, in his customary way, skilfully turning to himself, he began to talk about his own affairs and his views on life, high society and government service; he said a couple of words about the future destiny of Russia and how governors were to be kept in check; at which he gaily made fun of himself and added that, among other things, in St Petersburg he had been given the task ‘de populariser l’idée du cadastre’.1 He spoke for a rather long time, with careless self-assurance resolving all difficulties and juggling with the most important administrative and political questions. Expressions such as: ‘That’s what I’d do if I were the government’ and ‘You, as an intelligent man, will be bound to agree with me’ slipped off his tongue. Lavretsky listened coldly to Panshin’s exhortations: he did not like this handsome, clever man with his unforced elegance, his bright smile, his polite voice and probing eyes. Panshin soon guessed, with his habitual quick understanding of another’s feelings, that he was not giving his listener particular pleasure and on a favourable pretext absented himself, having decided for his own part that Lavretsky might be an excellent person, but he was also unsympathetic, aigri and, en somme, slightly ridiculous. Marya Dmitrievna appeared in the company of Gedeonovsky; then came Marfa Timofeyevna and Liza, and after them the remaining members of the household; then came the music-lover, Mrs Belenitsyn, a small, thin woman, with an almost childish little face, wan and pretty, in a rustling black dress, with a colourful fan and fat gold bracelets; her husband also came, a red-cheeked, puffy man with large feet and hands, with white eyelashes and a fixed smile on his thick lips; when they were guests his wife never spoke to him, but at home, in moments of tenderness, she called him her little porker. Panshin returned; the rooms became very noisy and full of people. Such a mass of people did not suit Lavretsky’s purpose; he was particularly irritated by Mrs Belenitsyn, who continually looked at him through her lorgnette. He would have left at once, had it not been for Liza: he wanted to have a word with her alone, but for a long time he could not find a suitable moment and had to content himself with the secret delight of following her with his eyes; her face had never seemed to him more noble or charming. She gained much through being close to Mrs Belenitsyn. That lady ceaselessly fidgeted on her chair, shrugged her narrow little shoulders, gave affected laughs and either screwed up her eyes or suddenly opened them wide. Liza sat quietly looking straight ahead of her and not laughing at all. The hostess sat down to play cards with Marfa Timofeyevna, Belenitsyn and Gedeonovsky, who played exceedingly slowly, made endless mistakes, blinked his eyes and wiped his face with a handkerchief. Panshin assumed a melancholy air, expressed himself briefly, pointedly and gravely – for all the world like a misunderstood artist-but notwithstanding the entreaties of Mrs Belenitsyn, who flirted with him outrageously, declined to sing his romance, since Lavretsky’s presence embarrassed him. Fyodor Ivanych also spoke little; the special look on his face had struck Liza as soon as he had entered the room; she sensed at once that he had something to tell her, but she was frightened of asking him, without knowing exactly why. Finally, as she was crossing into the main room to pour the tea, she turned her head in his direction despite herself. At once he followed her.","Panshin began with compliments to Lavretsky, with a description of the rapture in which, according to him, the whole family of Marya Dmitrievna! spoke of Vassilyevskoe; and then, according to his custom, passing neatly to himself, began to talk about his pursuits, and his views on life, the world and government service; uttered a sentence or two upon the future of Russia, and the duty of rulers to keep a strict hand over the country; and at this point laughed light-heartedly at his own expense, and added that among other things he had been intrusted in Petersburg with the duty de poplariser l’idee du cadastre. He spoke somewhat at length, passing over all difficulties with careless self-confidence, and playing with the weightiest administrative and political questions, as a juggler plays with balls. The expressions: “That’s what I would do if I were in the government;” “you as a man of intelligence, will agree with me at once,” were constantly on his lips. Lavretsky listened coldly to Panshin’s chatter; he did not like this handsome, clever, easily-elegant young man, with his bright smile, affable voice, and inquisitive eyes. Panshin, with the quick insight into the feelings of others, which was peculiar to him, soon guessed that he was not giving his companion any special satisfaction, and made a plausible excuse to go away, inwardly deciding that Lavretsky might be an “excellent man,” but he was unattractive, aigri, and, en somme, rather absurd. Marya Dmitrievna made her appearance escorted by Gedeonovsky, then Marfa Timofyevna and Lisa came in; and after them the other members of the household; and then the musical amateur, Madame Byelenitsin, arrived, a little thinnish lady, with a languid, pretty, almost childish little face, wearing a rusting dress, a striped fan, and heavy gold bracelets. Her husband was with her, a fat red-faced man, with large hands and feet, white eye-lashes, and an immovable smile on his thick lips; his wife never spoke to him in company, but at home, in moments of tenderness, she used to call him her little sucking-pig. Panshin returned; the rooms were very full of people and noise. Such a crowd was not to Lavretsky’s taste; and he was particularly irritated by Madame Byelenitsin, who kept staring at him through her eye-glasses. He would have gone away at once but for Lisa; he wanted to say a few words to her alone, but for a long time he could not get a favourable opportunity, and had to content himself with following her in secret delight with his eyes; never had her face seemed sweeter and more noble to him. She gained much from being near Madame Byelenitsin. The latter was for ever fidgeting in her chair, shrugging her narrow shoulders, giving little girlish giggles, and screwing up her eyes and then opening them wide; Lisa sat quietly, looked directly at every one and did not laugh at all. Madame Kalitin sat down to a game of cards with Marfa Timofyevna, Madame Byelenitsin, and Gedeonovsky, who played very slowly, and constantly made mistakes, frowning and wiping his face with his handkerchief. Panshin assumed a melancholy air, and expressed himself in brief, pregnant, and gloomy phrases, played the part, in fact, of the unappreciated genius, but in spite of the entreaties of Madame Byelenitsin, who was very coquettish with him, he would not consent to sing his son; he felt Lavretsky’s presence a constraint. Fedor Ivanitch also spoke little the peculiar expression of his face struck Lisa directly he came into the room; she felt at once that he had something to tell her, and though she could not herself have said why, she was afraid to question him. At last, as she was going into the next room to pour out tea, she involuntarily turned her head in his direction. He at once went after her."
"– Лиза, Лиза, – закричала Марья Дмитриевна, – поди сюда, посмотри, какого карася я поймала.","“Liza, Liza,” cried Marya Dmitrievna, “come here, look at what kind of crucian I have caught.”","‘Liza, Liza,’ cried Marya Dmitrievna, ‘come and have a look at the carp I’ve caught!’","“Lisa, Lisa!” cried Marya Dmitrievna, “do come here, and look what a fine carp I have caught.”"
"– Что хотите, – отвечал Лаврецкий и сел так, что мог смотреть на нее.","“Whatever you like,” answered Lavretsky, and sat down so that he could look at her.","‘Whatever you like,’ Lavretsky answered and sat down so that he could see her.","“What you like,” answered Lavretsky as he sat down so that he could look at her."
"Старик молча поклонился и побежал за ключами. Пока он бегал, ямщик сидел неподвижно, сбочась и поглядывая на запертую дверь; а лакей Лаврецкого как спрыгнул, так и остался в живописной позе, закинув одну руку на козлы. Старик принес ключи и, без всякой нужды изгибаясь, как змея, высоко поднимая локти, отпер дверь, посторонился и опять поклонился в пояс.","The old man bowed silently and ran for the keys. While he was running, the coachman sat motionless, slumped over and looking at the locked door; and Lavretsky's lackey jumped down and remained in a picturesque pose, throwing one arm over the goats. The old man brought the keys and, needlessly bending like a snake, raising his elbows high, unlocked the door, stood aside and again bowed from the waist.","The old man bowed silently and ran off to get the keys. While he was gone, the driver sat motionlessly, his arms at his sides, giving looks at the closed door; while Lavretsky’s servant, having jumped down, remained in exactly that picturesque pose with one hand thrown over the box. The old man brought the keys and, quite needlessly writhing like a snake, unlocked the door holding up his elbows high, stood aside and again gave a low bow from the waist.","The old man bowed without speaking, and ran off for the keys. While he went, the coachman sat motionless, sitting sideways and staring at the closed door, but Lavretsky’s groom stood as he had leaped down in a picturesque pose with one arm thrown back on the box. The old man brought the keys, and, quite needlessly, twisting about like a snake, with his elbows raised high, he opened the door, stood on one side, and again bowed to the earth."
– Отчего же?,- From what?,‘Why?’,“Why?”
"Он застал жену за завтраком; Ада, вся в буклях, в беленьком платьице с голубыми ленточками, кушала баранью котлетку. Варвара Павловна тотчас встала, как только Лаврецкий вошел в комнату, и с покорностью на лице подошла к нему. Он попросил ее последовать за ним в кабинет, запер за собою дверь и начал ходить взад и вперед; она села, скромно положила одну руку на другую и принялась следить за ним своими все еще прекрасными, хотя слегка подрисованными, глазами.","He found his wife at breakfast; Ada, all dressed up, in a little white dress with blue ribbons, was eating a mutton cutlet. Varvara Pavlovna got up at once as soon as Lavretsky entered the room, and went up to him with submissive expression on her face. He asked her to follow him into the study, locked the door behind him, and began pacing up and down; she sat down, modestly put one hand on the other, and began to follow him with her still beautiful, if slightly painted, eyes.","He found his wife at breakfast; Ada, her hair a mass of curls, dressed in a pale-white frock with pale-blue ribbons, was eating her mutton cutlet. Varvara Pavlovna rose the instant Lavretsky came into the room and approached him with a look of submissiveness on her face. He asked her to follow him into his study, locked the door behind him and began walking to and fro; she sat down, placing one hand modestly upon the other, and proceeded to follow him with her still beautiful, though slightly touched-up eyes.","He found his wife at breakfast; Ada, in curl-papers, in a little white frock with blue ribbons, was eating her mutton cutlet. Varvara Pavlovna rose at once directly Lavretsky entered the room, and went to meet him with humility in her face. He asked her to follow him into the study, shut the door after them, and began to walk up and down; she sat down, modestly laying one hand over the other, and began to follow his movements with her eyes, which were still beautiful, though they were pencilled lightly under their lids."
"Лаврецкий посмотрел ей вслед и, понурив голову, отправился назад по улице. Он наткнулся на Лемма, который тоже шел, надвинув шляпу на нос и глядя себе под ноги. Они молча посмотрели друг на друга.","Lavretsky looked after her and, bowing his head, walked back down the street. He bumped into Lemm, who was also walking, his hat pulled down over his nose and looking down at his feet. They silently looked at each other.","Lavretsky watched her go and, bowing his head, turned back along the street. He bumped into Lemm who also walked along with his hat pulled down to his nose and his eyes fixed on his feet. They exchanged looks in silence.","Lavretsky looked after her, and with bowed head, turned back along the street. He stumbled up against Lemm, who was also walking along with his eyes on the ground, and his hat pulled down to his nose. They looked at one another without speaking."
– Почему же? – спросил Лаврецкин.,Why not? asked Lavretskin.,‘Why exactly?’ asked Lavretsky.,“Why so?” inquired Lavretsky.
"– Да, ведь ты в Васильевское едешь. Ты не хочешь жить в Лавриках – ну, это твое дело; только съезди ты, поклонись гробу матери твоей, да и бабкину гробу кстати. Ты там, за границей, всякого ума набрался, а кто знает, может быть, они и почувствуют в своих могилках, что ты к ним пришел. Да не забудь, Федя, по Глафире Петровне тоже панафиду отслужить; вот тебе и целковый. Возьми, возьми, это я по ней хочу отслужить панафиду. Я ее при жизни не любила, а нечего сказать, с характером была девка. Умница была; ну и тебя не обидела. А теперь ступай с богом, а то я тебе надоем. И Марфа Тимофеевна обняла своего племянника.","- Yes, because you are going to Vasilyevskoye. You don't want to live in Lavriky - well, that's your business; just go and bow to your mother's coffin, and grandmother's coffin, by the way. You there, abroad, have gained all sorts of minds, and who knows, maybe they will feel in their graves that you have come to them. Don't forget, Fedya, to serve the Panafida according to Glafira Petrovna too; here's a whole one for you. Take it, take it, I want to serve a Panafida on it. I didn’t love her during her lifetime, but there’s nothing to say, she was a girl with character. She was smart; Well, I didn't offend you. Now go with God, or you'll get tired of me. And Marfa Timofeyevna embraced her nephew.","‘Yes, of course, you’re going to Vasilyevskoye. You don’t want to live in Lavriki – well, that’s your business. Only be sure to pay a visit to your mother’s grave, and to your grandmother’s while you’re about it. You must’ve picked up a lot of learning over there, in foreign countries, and – who knows – perhaps they’ll feel in their graves that you’ve come to visit them. And don’t forget, Fedya, to have a service said for Glafira Petrovna; here’s a rouble. Take it, take it, it’s because I want to have a service said for her. I didn’t love her when she was alive, but there’s no denying she was a woman with a character. A clever one, she was, and she didn’t treat you badly. But now be off with you in God’s name, or I’ll be boring you to tears.’ And Marfa Timofeyevna embraced her nephew.","“Yes, to be sure you are going to Vassilyevskoe. You don’t care to stay at Lavriky: well, that’s your own affair, only mind you go and say a prayer at our mother’s grave, and our grandmother’s too while you are there. Out there in foreign parts you have picked up all kinds of ideas, but who knows? Perhaps even in their graves they will feel that you have come to them. And, Fedya, don’t forget to have a service sung too for Glafira Petrovna; here’s a silver rouble for you. Take it, take it, I want to pay for a service for her. I had no love for her in her lifetime, but all the same there’s no denying she was a girl of character. She was a clever creature; and a good friend to you. And now go and God be with you, before I weary you.” And Marfa Timofyevna embraced her nephew."

"Она объявила, что голова у ней болит, и ушла к себе наверх, нерешительно протянув Лаврецкому кончики пальцев.","She announced that she had a headache, and went upstairs to her room, hesitantly holding out her fingertips to Lavretsky.","She announced that she had a headache and went upstairs to her room, irresolutely holding out to Lavretsky the tips of her fingers.","She declared that her head ached and went to her own room up-stairs, hesitatingly holding out the tips of her fingers to Lavretsky."
"– Садитесь, садитесь, мой дорогой Федор Иваныч. Ах, как я рада! Позвольте, во-первых, представить вам мою дочь Лизу…","“Sit down, sit down, my dear Fyodor Ivanovich. Oh, how glad I am! Let me first introduce you to my daughter Lisa...","‘Sit down, do sit down, my dear Fyodor Ivanych. Ah, how glad I am! Let me first of all introduce you to my daughter Liza…’","“Sit down, sit down, my dear Fedor Ivanitch. Ah, how glad I am! But let me present my daughter Lisa to you.”"
"Лаврецкий провел полтора дня в Васильевском и почти все время пробродил по окрестностям. Он не мог оставаться долго на одном месте: тоска его грызла; он испытывал все терзанья непрестанных, стремительных и бессильных порывов. Вспомнил он чувство, охватившее его душу на другой день после приезда в деревню; вспомнил свои тогдашние намерения и сильно негодовал на себя. Что могло оторвать его от того, что он признал своим долгом, единственной задачей своей будущности? Жажда счастья – опять-таки жажда счастья!» «Видно, Михалевич прав, – думал он. – Ты захотел вторично изведать счастья в жизни, – говорил он сам себе, – ты позабыл, что и то роскошь, незаслуженная, милость, когда оно хоть однажды посетит человека. Оно не было полно, оно было ложно, скажешь ты; да предъяви же свои права на полное, истинное счастье! Оглянись, кто вокруг тебя блаженствует, кто наслаждается? Вон мужик едет на косьбу; может быть, он доволен своей судьбою… Что ж? захотел ли бы ты поменяться с ним? Вспомни мать свою: как ничтожно малы были ее требования, и какова выпала ей доля? Ты, видно, только похвастался перед Паншиным, когда сказал ему, что приехал в Россию затем, чтобы пахать землю; ты приехал волочиться на старости лет за девочками. Пришла весть о твоей свободе, и ты все бросил, все забыл, ты побежал, как мальчик за бабочкой…» Образ Лизы беспрестанно представлялся ему посреди его размышлений; он с усилием изгонял его, как и другой неотвязный образ, другие, невозмутимо-лукавые, красивые и ненавистные черты. Старик Антон заметил, что барину не по себе; вздохнувши несколько раз за дверью да несколько раз на пороге, он решился подойти к нему, посоветовал ему напиться чего-нибудь тепленького. Лаврецкий закричал на него, велел ему выйти, а потом извинился перед ним; но Антон от этого еще больше опечалился. Лаврецкий не мог сидеть в гостиной: ему так и чудилось, что прадед Андрей презрительно глядит с полотна на хилого своего потомка. «Эх ты! мелко плаваешь!» – казалось, говорили его набок скрученные губы. «Неужели же, – думал он, – я не слажу с собою, поддамся этому… вздору?» (Тяжело раненные на войне всегда называют «вздором» свои раны. Не обманывать себя человеку – не жить ему на земле.) «Мальчишка я, что ли, в самом деле? Ну да: увидал вблизи, в руках почти держал возможность счастия на всю жизнь – оно вдруг исчезло; да ведь и в лотерее – повернись колесо еще немного, и бедняк, пожалуй, стал бы богачом. Не бывать, так не бывать – и кончено. Возьмусь за дело, стиснув зубы, да и велю себе молчать; благо, мне не в первый раз брать себя в руки. И для чего я бежал, зачем сижу здесь, забивши, как страус, голову в куст? Страшно беде в глаза взглянуть – вздор!» – Антон! – закричал он громко, – прикажи сейчас закладывать тарантас. «Да, – подумал он опять, – надо велеть себе молчать, надо взять себя в ежовые рукавицы…»","Lavretsky spent a day and a half in Vasilievsky and wandered about the neighborhood almost all the time. He could not stay long in one place: longing gnawed at him; he experienced all the torment of incessant, impetuous and impotent impulses. He recalled the feeling that had seized his soul the day after his arrival in the village; remembered his intentions of that time and was greatly indignant with himself. What could tear him away from what he recognized as his duty, the only task of his future? The thirst for happiness is again the thirst for happiness!” “You can see Mikhalevich is right,” he thought. “You wanted to experience happiness a second time in life,” he said to himself, “you forgot that even that is a luxury, undeserved, mercy, when it visits a person at least once. It was not complete, it was false, you will say; Yes, present your rights to complete, true happiness! Look around you, who is blissful around you, who is enjoying? There is a peasant going to mowing; maybe he is satisfied with his fate ... Well? Would you like to change with him? Remember your mother: how insignificant were her demands, and what was her share? Apparently, you only boasted to Panshin when you told him that you came to Russia to plow the land; you came to drag yourself in your old age for the girls. The news of your freedom came, and you abandoned everything, forgot everything, you ran like a boy after a butterfly ... ”The image of Lisa constantly appeared to him in the midst of his thoughts; he banished it with an effort, as well as the other obsessive image, other imperturbably sly, beautiful and hateful features. Old man Anton noticed that the master was uneasy; sighing several times outside the door and several times on the threshold, he decided to go up to him and advised him to drink something warm. Lavretsky shouted at him, ordered him to leave, and then apologized to him; but Anton was even more saddened by this. Lavretsky could not sit in the living room: it seemed to him that great-grandfather Andrei looked contemptuously from the canvas at his frail descendant. ""Oh you! swim shallow!"" His curled lips seemed to say. “Is it possible,” he thought, “I won’t manage with myself, I will succumb to this ... nonsense?” (Heavily wounded in the war always call their wounds “nonsense”. If a person does not deceive himself, he will not live on earth.) “Am I a boy, or what, really? Well, yes: I saw it up close, in my hands I almost held the possibility of happiness for life - it suddenly disappeared; yes, even in the lottery - turn the wheel a little more, and the poor man, perhaps, would become a rich man. Not to be, so not to be - and it's over. I'll get down to business, gritting my teeth, and tell myself to be silent; Fortunately, this is not the first time for me to pull myself together. And why did I run, why do I sit here, stuffing my head into a bush like an ostrich? It’s scary to look trouble in the eye - nonsense! – Anton! he shouted loudly, “order now to lay the tarantass. “Yes,” he thought again, “you must tell yourself to be silent, you must put yourself in tight rein…”","LAVRETSKY spent a day and a half in Vasilyevskoye and almost all the time wandered about the place. He could never stay long in one place: regret gnawed at him; he experienced all the torments of never-ending, impetuous and impotent passion. He remembered the feeling that overwhelmed him the day after his arrival in the country; he remembered his intentions at that time and felt utterly disgusted with himself. What could have torn him away from what he considered his duty, the one and only task of his future life? The thirst for happiness, that same old thirst for happiness! ‘ Evidently Mikhalevich was right,’ he thought. ‘What you wanted’, he said to himself, ‘was to know happiness for the second time in your life, and you forgot that it is a luxury, an undeserved favour, when it visits a man’s life even once. It was not full happiness, it was false happiness, you will say – then show what right you have to full and perfect happiness! Look about you and see who is happy, who enjoys life. Look, there’s a peasant on the way to mowing, perhaps he’s happy with his fate…. Do you want to change places with him, eh? Remember your mother and how triflingly small were her demands, yet what was her share of life’s happiness? You were evidently only boasting to Panshin when you told him that you’d come to Russia to plough the land; you had come in your old age to go chasing after young girls. No sooner had news come that you were free than you cast everything aside, forgot everything and ran off like a boy after a butterfly…’ The image of Liza endlessly rose before him in the midst of his cogitations; he banished it from him with an effort, as he did that other importunate image, those other nonchalantly calculating, beautiful, despicable features. Old Anton noticed that his master was preoccupied; sighing several times behind the door, and several times in the doorway, he made up his mind to approach him and proffered the advice that he should drink something warming. Lavretsky shouted at him, ordered him out and then begged his pardon; but Anton became even more crestfallen as a result. Lavretsky could not sit in the drawing-room, for he gained the quite literal impression that his great-grandfather Andrey looked despisingly from the canvas at this gutless descendant of his. ‘ Hey, you, you small fry!’ his sideways twisted lips seemed to be saying. ‘Will I, though,’ Lavretsky thought, ‘be unable to get myself right, will I give in to this… nonsense?’ (Severely wounded soldiers always call their wounds ‘nonsense’. Without deceiving himself a man cannot live.) ‘What am I, in fact – just a little boy? Well, yes: I saw within reach, almost held in my hands, the possibility of lifelong happiness – and then it suddenly vanished; just as in roulette, the wheel has only to turn a fraction more and the beggar perhaps becomes a rich man. But if it’s not to be, it’s not to be – and that’s the end of it. I will do what I have to do with clenched teeth, and tell myself to keep quiet; one blessing is that it’s not the first time I’ve had to take myself in hand. And why did I run away, why am I sitting here with my head in the sand like an ostrich? They say it’s terrible to look catastrophe in the face – nonsense!’ ‘Anton,’ he cried loudly, ‘Order the tarantass to be got ready at once!’ ‘Yes,’ he thought again, ‘I must tell myself to keep quiet, I must rule myself with a rod of iron…’","Lavretsky spent a day and a half at Vassilyevskoe, and employed almost all the time in wandering about the neighbourhood. He could not stop long in one place: he was devoured by anguish; he was torn unceasingly by impotent violent impulses. He remembered the feeling which had taken possession of him the day after his arrival in the country; he remembered his plans then and was intensely exasperated with himself. What had been able to tear him away from what he recognised as his duty—as the one task set before him in the future? The thirst for happiness—again the same thirst for happiness. “It seems Mihalevitch was right,” he thought; “you wanted a second time to taste happiness in life,” he said to himself, “you forgot that it is a luxury, an undeserved bliss, if it even comes once to a man. It was not complete, it was not genuine, you say; but prove your right to full, genuine happiness Look round and see who is happy, who enjoys life about you? Look at that peasant going to the mowing; is he contented with his fate?... What! would you care to change places with him? Remember your mother; how infinitely little she asked of life, and what a life fell to her lot. You were only bragging it seems when you said to Panshin that you had come back to Russia to cultivate the soil; you have come back to dangle after young girls in your old age. Directly the news of your freedom came, you threw up everything, forgot everything; you ran like a boy after a butterfly.”.... The image of Lisa continually presented itself in the midst of his broodings. He drove it away with an effort together with another importunate figure, other serenely wily, beautiful, hated features. Old Anton noticed that the master was not himself: after sighing several times outside the door and several times in the doorway, he made up his mind to go up to him, and advised him to take a hot drink of something. Lavretsky swore at him ; ordered him out; afterwards he begged his pardon, but that only made Anton still more sorrowful. Lavretsky could not stay in the drawing-room; it seemed to him that his great-grandfather Andrey, was looking contemptuously from the canvas at his feeble descendant. “Bah: you swim in shallow water,” the distorted lips seemed to be saying. “Is it possible,” he thought, “that I cannot master myself, that I am going to give in to this... nonsense?” (Those who are badly wounded in war always call their wounds “nonsense.” If man did not deceive himself, he could not live on earth.) “Am I really a boy? Ah, well; I saw quite close, I almost held in my hands the possibility of happiness for my whole life; yes, in the lottery too—turn the wheel a little and the beggar perhaps would be a rich man. If it does not happen, then it does not—and it’s all over. I will set to work, with my teeth clenched, and make myself be quiet; it’s as well , it’s not the first time I have had to hold myself in. And why have I run away, why am I stopping here sticking my head in a bush, like an ostrich? A fearful thing to face trouble... nonsense! Anton,” he called aloud, “order the coach to be brought round at once. Yes,” he thought again, “I must grin and bear it, I must keep myself well in hand.”"

"Лиза начала играть и долго не отводила глаз от своих пальцев. Она взглянула, наконец, на Лаврецкого, и остановилась: так чудно и странно показалось ей его лицо.","Lisa began to play and did not take her eyes off her fingers for a long time. She looked at last at Lavretsky, and stopped: his face seemed so wondrous and strange to her.","Liza began to play and for a long while did not lift her eyes from her fingers. She looked, finally, at Lavretsky and stopped: his face looked so strange and wonderful.","Lisa began to play, and for a long while she did not lift her eyes from her fingers. She glanced at last at Lavretsky, and stopped short; his face seemed strange and beautiful to her."
"– Лиза, ради бога, вы требуете невозможного. Я готов сделать все, что вы прикажете; но теперь примириться с нею!.. Я согласен на все, я все забыл; но не могу же я заставить свое сердце… Помилуйте, это жестоко!","“Lisa, for God's sake, you are asking for the impossible.

I consent to everything, I have forgotten everything; but I cannot force my heart.... Indeed, this is cruel!"

"Михалевич уехал на другой день, как ни удерживал его Лаврецкий. Федору Ивановичу не удалось убедить его остаться; но наговорился он с ним досыта. Оказалось, что у Михалевича гроша за душой не было. Лаврецкий уже накануне с сожалением заметил в нем все признаки и привычки застарелой бедности: сапоги у него были сбиты, сзади на сюртуке недоставало одной пуговицы, руки его не ведали перчаток, в волосах торчал пух; приехавши, он и не подумал попросить умыться, а за ужином ел, как акула, раздирая руками мясо и с треском перегрызая кости своими крепкими черными зубами. Оказалось также, что служба но пошла ему впрок, что все надежды свои он возлагал на откупщика, который взял его единственно для того, чтобы иметь у себя в конторе «образованного человека». Со всем тем Михалевич не унывал и жил себе циником, идеалистом, поэтом, искренно радея и сокрушаясь о судьбах человечества, о собственном призвании – и весьма мало заботясь о том, как бы не умереть с голоду. Михалевич женат не был, но влюблялся без счету и писал стихотворения на всех своих возлюбленных; особенно пылко воспел он одну таинственную чернокудрую «панну»… Ходили, правда, слухи, будто эта панна была простая жидовка, хорошо известная многим кавалерийским офицерам… но, как подумаешь – разве и это не все равно?","Mikhalevich left the next day, no matter how Lavretsky kept him. Fyodor Ivanovich failed to convince him to stay; but he talked to him to his heart's content. It turned out that Mikhalevich did not have a penny to his name. Lavretsky had already noticed with regret the day before in him all the signs and habits of chronic poverty: his boots were knocked off, one button was missing from the back of his frock coat, his hands did not know gloves, fluff stuck out in his hair; when he arrived, he did not even think to ask to wash, and at dinner he ate like a shark, tearing meat with his hands and cracking through the bones with his strong black teeth. It also turned out that the service did not go well for him, that he pinned all his hopes on the farmer, who took him solely in order to have an “educated person” in his office. With all this, Mikhalevich did not lose heart and lived for himself as a cynic, an idealist, a poet, sincerely caring and lamenting about the fate of mankind, about his own vocation - and very little caring about how not to die of hunger. Mikhalevich was not married, but he fell in love without counting and wrote poems for all his lovers; he sang with particular ardor one mysterious, black-haired “panna”… True, there were rumors that this panna was a simple Jewess, well known to many cavalry officers… but, what do you think – isn’t that all the same?","Mikhalevich left the next day, notwithstanding Lavretsky’s attempts to keep him there. Fyodor Ivanych did not succeed in persuading him to remain; but he talked to him to his heart’s content. It transpired that Mikhalevich had not got a penny to his name. On the previous day Lavretsky had noticed in him with regret all the signs and habits of longstanding poverty: his shoes were down at heel, a button was missing from the back of his coat, his hands were strangers to gloves and there was fluff in his hair; when he arrived he did not think of asking to wash, and at dinner he ate like a shark, tearing the meat with his hands and crunching the bones in his strong black teeth. It also transpired that government service had done him no good and that all his hopes were now placed on the tax-farmer, who had employed him solely in order to have ‘an educated man’ in his office. Despite this, Mikhalevich was not dispirited and lived to his liking the roles of cynic, idealist and poet, sincerely delighting in, and grieving for, the fate of mankind and his own vocation – and taking very little care about whether or not he died from hunger. Mikhalevich was unmarried, but he had fallen in love countless times and wrote poems to all his beloveds; he celebrated particularly ardently one mysterious black-curled ‘Polish lady’…. True, there were rumours that this Polish lady was no more than a Jewess well known to many cavalry officers…. But when you come to think of it, does that make any difference?","Mihalevitch set off the next day, in spite of all Lavretsky’s efforts to keep him. Fedor Ivanitch did not succeed in persuading him to remain; but he talked to him to his heart’s content. Mihalevitch, it appeared, had not a penny to bless himself with. Lavretsky had noticed with pain the evening before all the tokens and habits of years of poverty; his boots were shabby, a button was off on the back of his coat, on his arrival, he had not even thought of asking to wash, and at supper he ate like a shark, tearing his meat in his fingers, and crunching the bones with his strong black teeth. It appeared, too, that he had made nothing out of his employment, that he now rested all his hopes on the contractor who was taking him solely in order to have an “educated man” in his office. For all that Mihalevitch was not discouraged, but as idealist or cynic, lived on a crust of bread, sincerely rejoicing or grieving over the destinies of humanity, and his own vocation, and troubling himself very little as to how to escape dying of hunger. Mihalevitch was not married: but had been in love times beyond number, and had written poems to all the objects of his adoration; he sang with especial fervour the praises of a mysterious black-tressed “noble Polish lady.” There were rumours, it is true, that this “noble Polish lady” was a simple Jewess, very well known to a good many cavalry officers—but, after all, what do you think—does it really make any difference?"
"– Как? вы позволяете? – спросила Варвара Павловна и слегка, как бы с умиленьем, сложила руки.","- How? do you allow? Varvara Pavlovna asked, and slightly, as if with emotion, folded her hands.","‘Really? You permit me?’ Varvara Pavlovna asked and lightly, with a show of emotion, clasped her hands.","“What? you will allow me?” asked Varvara Pavlovna, and slightly, as though with emotion, clasped her hands."
"Старушка помолчала; Лаврецкий не знал, что сказать ей; но она его понимала.",The old woman was silent; Lavretsky did not know what to say to her; but she understood him.,The old lady fell silent; Lavretsky did not know what to say to her; but she understood him.,The old lady was silent for a little; Lavretsky did not know what to say to her; but she understood him.
"– Сиди, сиди; у меня самой ноги еще не отвалились. Должно быть, он у меня там в спальне.","- Sit, sit; My legs haven't fallen off yet. He must be in my bedroom there.","‘Sit down, sit down. My own legs haven’t fallen off yet. It’s probably there in my bedroom.’","“Sit down, sit down; I have still the use of my legs. It must be inside in my bedroom.”"
– Матушки мои! она его любит! – Марфа Тимофеевна сдернула с себя чепец. – Женатого человека любит! а? любит!,- My mothers! she loves him! Marfa Timofeevna pulled off her cap. - He loves a married man! a? loves!,‘Heavens above! She’s in love with him!’ Marfa Timofeyevna pulled the cap off her head. ‘She’s in love with a married man! Eh? She’s in love with him!’,“Merciful Heavens! She loves him!” Marfa Timofyevna snatched off her cap. “She loves a married man! Ah!
"– Помилуйте, Федор Иваныч! У вас в Лавриках такой чудесный дом! Лаврецкий чуть-чуть нахмурил брови.","- Have mercy, Fyodor Ivanovich! You have such a wonderful house in Lavriky! Lavretsky frowned a little.","‘Forgive me, Fyodor Ivanych, but at Lavriki you have such a delightful house!’ Lavretsky’s brows knit very slightly.","“Really, Fedor Ivanitch! You have such a magnificent house at Lavriky.” Lavretsky knitted his brows a little."
"– Люблю, – отвечала тихим голосом Лиза.","“I love you,” Lisa answered in a low voice.","‘I’m in love with him,’ Liza answered in a quiet voice.","“I love him,” answered Lisa softly."
"– Не спрашивайте меня, – перебила ее Варвара Павловна и потупилась. – Я была молода, легкомысленна… Впрочем, я не хочу оправдываться.","""Don't ask me,"" Varvara Pavlovna interrupted her and looked down. - I was young, frivolous ... However, I do not want to make excuses.","‘Don’t ask me,’ Varvara Pavlovna interrupted her and bowed her head. ‘I was young and thoughtless… Besides, I don’t want to justify myself.’","“Don’t question me,” Varvara Pavlovna interrupted her, and she cast down her eyes. “I was young, frivolous. But I don’t want to justify myself.”"
"– Как не быть-с, как не быть-с, – возразил гость, медленно моргая и вытягивая губы. – Гм!.. да вот пожалуйте, есть новость, и преудивительная: Лаврецкий Федор Иваныч приехал.","“How not to be, sir, how not to be,” objected the guest, blinking slowly and stretching his lips. “Hm! .. yes, please, there is news, and surprising: Fyodor Ivanovich Lavretsky has arrived.","‘Haven’t I indeed,’ the guest responded, giving slow winks and protruding his lips. ‘ Hm!… mark you, there is something very surprising about this piece of news: Fyodor Ivanych Lavretsky has come back.’","“There is indeed!” replied the visitor, slowly blinking his eyes and pursing up his mouth. “Hm!... yes, indeed, there is a piece of news, and very surprising news too. Lavretsky—Fedor Ivanitch is here.”"
"Лиза хотела ответить Лаврецкому – и ни слова не вымолвила, не оттого, что она решилась «спешить»; но оттого, что сердце у ней слишком сильно билось и чувство, похожее на страх, захватило дыхание.","Liza wanted to answer Lavretsky, but she didn't utter a word, not because she decided to ""hurry up""; but because her heart was beating too fast and a feeling like fear took her breath away.","Liza wanted to answer Lavretsky – and did not utter a word, not because she had decided to ‘hurry’, but because her heart was beating too fast and a feeling akin to terror stifled her breathing.","Lisa tried to answer Lavretsky, but she did not utter a word—not because she was resolved to “be in a hurry,” but because her heart was beating too violently and a feeling, akin to terror, stopped her breath."
"– Да с чего ты взял, что я лежу? – твердил Лаврецкий, – почему ты предполагаешь во мне такие мысли?","- Yes, where did you get that I'm lying? repeated Lavretsky, “why do you suppose such thoughts in me?",‘Where have you got the idea from that I’m lying about?’ Lavretsky asked. ‘Why do you ascribe such ideas to me?’,“And from what do you infer that I lie idle?” Lavretsky protested stoutly. “Why do you attribute such ideas to me?”
"– Он мне сказывал, что жена его скончалась. Марфа Тимофеевна перекрестилась.",He told me that his wife had passed away. Marfa Timofeyevna crossed herself.,‘He told me his wife had died.’ Marfa Timofeyevna crossed herself.,“He told me that his wife was dead.” Marfa Timofyevna crossed herself.
– Направо.,- Right.,‘To the right.’,“Yes.”
"Судьба этой женщины была замечательна. Она происходила из крестьянского семейства; шестнадцати лет ее выдали за мужика; но от своих сестер-крестьянок она отличалась резко. Отец ее лет двадцать был старостой, нажил денег много и баловал ее. Красавица она была необыкновенная, первая щеголиха по всему околотку, умница, речистая, смелая. Ее барин, Дмитрий Пестов, отец Марьи Дмитриевны, человек скромный и тихий, увидал ее однажды на молотьбе, поговорил с ней и страстно в нее влюбился. Она скоро овдовела; Пестов, хотя и женатый был человек, взял ее к себе в дом, одел ее по-дворовому. Агафья тотчас освоилась с новым своим положением, точно она век свой иначе не жила. Она побелела, пополнела; руки у ней под кисейными рукавами стали «крупичатые», как у купчихи; самовар не сходил со стола; кроме шелку да бархату она ничего носить не хотела, спала на пуховых перинах. Лет пять продолжалась эта блаженная жизнь, но Дмитрий Пестов умер; вдова его, барыня добрая, жалея память покойника, не хотела поступить с своей соперницей нечестно, тем более что Агафья никогда перед ней не забывалась; однако выдала ее за скотника и сослала с глаз долой. Прошло года три. Раз как-то, в жаркий летний день, барыня заехала к себе на скотный двор. Агафья попотчевала ее такими славными холодными сливками, так скромно себя держала и сама была такая опрятная, веселая, всем довольная, что барыня объявила ей прощение и позволила ходить в дом; а месяцев через шесть так к ней привязалась, что произвела ее в экономки и поручила ей все хозяйство. Агафья опять вошла в силу, опять раздобрела и побелела; барыня совсем ей вверилась. Так прошло еще лет пять. Несчастье вторично обрушилось на Агафью. Муж ее, которого она вывела в лакеи, запил, стал пропадать из дому и кончил тем, что украл шесть господских серебряных ложек и запрятал их – до случая – в женин сундук. Это открылось. Его опять повернули в скотники, а на Агафью наложили опалу; из дома ее не выгнали, но разжаловали из экономок в швеи и велели ей вместо чепца носить на голове платок. К удивлению всех, Агафья с покорным смирением приняла поразивший ее удар. Ей уже было тогда за тридцать лет, дети у ней все померли, и муж жил недолго. Пришла ей пора опомниться: она опомнилась. Она стала очень молчалива и богомольна, не пропускала ни одной заутрени, ни одной обедни, раздарила все свои хорошие платья. Пятнадцать лет провела она тихо, смиренно, степенно, ни с кем не ссорясь, всем уступая. Нагрубит ли ей кто – она только поклонится и поблагодарит за учение. Барыня давно ей простила, и опалу сложила с нее, и с своей головы чепец подарила; но она сама не захотела снять свой платок и все ходила в темном платье; а после смерти барыни она стала еще тише и ниже. Русский человек боится и привязывается легко; но уважение его заслужить трудно: дается оно не скоро и не всякому. Агафью все в доме очень уважали; никто и не вспоминал о прежних грехах, словно их вместе с старым барином в землю похоронили.","The fate of this woman was remarkable. She came from a peasant family; at the age of sixteen she was married off to a peasant; but she differed sharply from her peasant sisters. Her father was a headman for twenty years, he made a lot of money and spoiled her. She was an extraordinary beauty, the first dandy in the whole neighborhood, clever, well-spoken, bold. Her master, Dmitri Pestov, Marya Dmitrievna's father, a modest and quiet man, saw her one day at the threshing floor, talked to her, and fell passionately in love with her. She soon became a widow; Pestov, although he was a married man, took her to his house, dressed her in the courtyard. Agafya immediately got used to her new position, as if she had never lived her life differently. She turned white, grew stout; her hands under the muslin sleeves became ""grainy"" like those of a merchant's wife; the samovar did not leave the table; she did not want to wear anything except silk and velvet, she slept on downy featherbeds. This blissful life continued for five years, but Dmitry Pestov died; his widow, a kind lady, pitying the memory of the deceased, did not want to act dishonestly with her rival, especially since Agafya never forgot herself before her; however, she passed her off as a cattleman and exiled her out of sight. Three years have passed. Once, on a hot summer day, the lady stopped by her barnyard. Agafya regaled her with such glorious cold cream, behaved so modestly, and was herself so neat, cheerful, pleased with everything, that the mistress announced forgiveness to her and allowed her to go into the house; and six months later she became so attached to her that she made her a housekeeper and entrusted her with the whole household. Agafya again came into her strength, again grew mellow and turned white; the lady completely trusted her. So another five years passed. Misfortune befell Agafya a second time. Her husband, whom she took out as a footman, took to drink, began to disappear from the house, and ended up stealing six of the master's silver spoons and hiding them—until it happened—in his wife's chest. It opened up. He was again turned into cattlemen, and disgrace was imposed on Agafya; they didn’t kick her out of the house, but demoted her from housekeeper to seamstress and ordered her to wear a scarf on her head instead of a cap. To the surprise of everyone, Agafya accepted the blow that struck her with submissive humility. She was then over thirty years old, her children all died, and her husband did not live long. The time has come for her to come to her senses: she has come to her senses. She became very silent and devout, did not miss a single matins, not a single mass, gave away all her good dresses. She spent fifteen years quietly, humbly, sedately, without quarreling with anyone, yielding to everyone. If someone is rude to her, she will only bow and thank for the teaching. The mistress forgave her long ago, and laid down the disgrace from her, and gave her a cap from her head; but she herself did not want to take off her handkerchief and went about in a dark dress; and after the death of the mistress, she became even quieter and lower. A Russian person is afraid and easily attached; but it is difficult to earn his respect: it is not given quickly and not to everyone. Everyone in the house respected Agafya very much; no one remembered the previous sins, as if they were buried in the ground together with the old master.","This woman’s story was remarkable. She came of a peasant family; at sixteen she was married to a muzhik; but she was in sharp contrast to her peasant sisters. Her father had been a village elder for twenty years, had accumulated a good deal of money and spoiled her. She was extraordinarily good-looking, the best-dressed woman in the whole region, clever, talkative and bold. Her master, Dmitry Pestov, Marya Dmitrievna’s father, a quiet and modest man, saw her once during the threshing, talked to her and fell passionately in love with her. She was soon widowed; Pestov, although a married man, took her into his house and dressed her like a house-serf. Agafya at once acclimatized herself to her new position, just as if she had never lived otherwise. She grew paler and fuller; her arms beneath her muslin sleeves grew ‘white as wheaten flour’, like those of a merchant’s wife; the samovar was never off the table; she would wear nothing but silk and velvet and slept on feather beds. This life of bliss lasted about five years, until Dmitry Pestov died; his widow, a kindly woman, in deference to the dead man’s memory, had no wish to deal dishonourably with her rival, more especially since Agafya had never been disrespectful to her; however, she married her off to a cowherd and banished her from sight. Three years or so passed. One hot summer’s day the mistress paid a visit to her cowsheds. Agafya offered her such excellent cold dairy cream, carried herself so modestly and was so neatly dressed, happy and contented with everything, that her mistress forgave her and allowed her to return to the house; and within six months had become so attached to her that she made her a housekeeper and entrusted the management of the household to her. Agafya again came into her own, grew plump and white-skinned; her mistress had implicit confidence in her. So passed another five years. Misfortune broke over Agafya’s head a second time. Her husband, whom she had raised into a manservant, took to drink, started absenting himself from the house and ended by stealing six of the mistress’s silver spoons and hiding them – for the time being – in his wife’s trunk. The theft was discovered. He was again turned into a cowherd, but Agafya suffered the worse indignity of disgrace; though she was not driven from the house, she was downgraded from housekeeper to seamstress and ordered to wear a kerchief instead of a cap. To everyone’s surprise, Agafya accepted the blow that had fallen on her with meek humility. She was already more than thirty, all her children had died and her husband did not live long. The time had come for her to take stock; and take stock she did. She became very taciturn and religious, never missed a single morning or evening service, and gave away all her pretty dresses. Fifteen years she spent quietly, humbly, sedately, quarrelling with no one, acquiescent in all things. If people insulted her, she would simply bow her head and be grateful for the lesson. Her mistress had long since forgiven her, removed the disgrace from her and made her a gift of her own cap; but she herself had no wish to doff her kerchief and habitually went about in a dark dress; and after the death of her mistress she became still quieter and more humble. A Russian is always apprehensive and easily befriended; but it is hard to earn his respect: it is not given readily and not to everyone. Agafya was very much respected by everyone in the house; no one remembered her past sins, as if they had literally been buried in the earth along with the old master.","This woman’s story was remarkable. She came of a peasant family. She was married at sixteen to a peasant; but she was strikingly different from her peasant sisters. Her father had been twenty years starosta, and had made a good deal of money, and he spoiled her. She was exceptionally beautiful, the best-dressed girl in the whole district, clever, ready with her tongue, and daring. Her master Dmitri Pestov, Marya Dmitrievna’s father, a man of modest and gentle character, saw her one day at the threshing-floor, talked to her and fell passionately in love with her. She was soon left a widow; Pestov, though he was a married man, took her into his house and dressed her like a lady. Agafya at once adapted herself to her new position, just as if she had never lived differently all her life. She grew fairer and plumper; her arms grew as “floury white” under her muslin-sleeves as a merchant’s lady’s; the samovar never left her table; she would wear nothing except silk or velvet, and slept on well-stuffed feather-beds. This blissful existence lasted for five years, but Dmitri Pestov died; his widow, a kind-hearted woman, out of regard for the memory of the deceased, did not wish to treat her rival unfairly, all the more because Agafya had never forgotten herself in her presence. She married her, however, to a shepherd, and sent her a long way off. Three years passed. It happened one hot summer day that her mistress in driving past stopped at the cattle-yard. Agafya regaled her with such delicious cool cream, behaved so modestly, and was so neat, so bright, and so contented with everything that her mistress signified her forgiveness to her and allowed her to return to the house. Within six months she had become so much attached to her that she raised her to be housekeeper, and intrusted the whole household management to her. Agafya again returned to power, and again grew plump and fair; her mistress put the most complete confidence in her. So passed five years more. Misfortune again overtook Agafya. Her husband, whom she had promoted to be a footman, began to drink, took to vanishing from the house, and ended by stealing six of the mistress’ silver spoons and hiding them till a favourable moment in his wife’s box. It was opened. He was sent to be a shepherd again, and Agafya fell into disgrace. She was not turned out of the house, but was degraded from housekeeper to being a sewing-woman and was ordered to wear a kerchief on her head instead of a cap. To the astonishment of every one, Agafya accepted with humble resignation the blow that had fallen upon her. She was at that time about thirty, all her children were dead and her husband did not live much longer. The time had come for her to reflect. And she did reflect. She became very silent and devout, never missed a single matin’s service nor a single mass, and gave away all her fine clothes. She spent fifteen years quietly, peacefully, and soberly, never quarrelling with any one and giving way to every one. If any! one scolded her, she only bowed to them and thanked them for the admonition. Her mistress had long ago forgiven her, raised her out of disgrace, and made her a present of a cap of her own. But she was herself unwilling to give up the kerchief and always wore a dark dress. After her mistress’ death she became still more quiet and humble. A Russian readily feels fear, and affection; but it is hard to gain his respect: it is not soon given, nor to every one. For Agafya every one in the home had great respect; no one even remembered her previous sins, as though they had been buried with the old master."

"В гостиной Лаврецкий застал Марью Дмитриевну одну. От нее пахло одеколоном и мятой. У ней, по ее словам, болела голова, и ночь она провела беспокойно. Она приняла его с обычною своею томной любезностью и понемногу разговорилась.","In the drawing-room Lavretsky found Marya Dmitrievna alone. She smelled of cologne and mint.

– Ведь это отсюда недалеко? – спросила Лиза.,“Isn’t it close to here?” Lisa asked.,"‘Surely it’s not far away, is it?’ asked Liza.",“Is it far from here?” asked Lisa.
"– Уж вы, тетушка, всегда… – пробормотала с досадой Марья Дмитриевна и застучала пальцами по ручке кресела.","“Auntie, you always…” Marya Dmitrievna muttered with annoyance and tapped her fingers on the arm of her chair.","‘Oh, auntie dear, you’re always…’ muttered Marya Dmitrievna in vexation and began tapping her fingers on the arm of her chair.","“Really, auntie, you are always so...” muttered Marya Dmitrievna in a tone of vexation, drumming on the arm of her chair with her finger-tips."
"– Да, такой же, как твой отец, и сам того не подозреваешь.","“Yes, just like your father, and you yourself do not suspect it.","‘Yes, just like your father, and yet you don’t even suspect it.’","“Yes, like your father, and you yourself do not suspect it.”"
"– Все-таки, признаюсь, я этого не ожидал, – возразил Лаврецкий, – тут смелость нужна была большая.","“All the same, I confess, I did not expect this,” Lavretsky objected, “great courage was needed here.","‘Nevertheless, I admit I hadn’t expected this,’ Lavretsky said. ‘This needed great boldness.’","“Still, I confess I did not expect this,” rejoined Lavretsky; “there must be great effrontery to do this.”"
"– Да-с, – возразил Годеоновский, – другой на его месте и в свет-то показаться посовестился бы.","- Yes, sir, - Godeonovsky objected, - another in his place would be ashamed to appear in the world.","‘Yes, indeed,’ responded Gedeonovsky, ‘another man in his place would have thought twice about appearing in society.’","“Yes, indeed,” observed Gedeonovsky; “any other man in Fedor Ivanitch’s position would have hesitated to appear in society.”"
"– Это мне известно, – промолвил Лаврецкий.","“I know that,” said Lavretsky.","‘That is known to me,’ said Lavretsky.","“I was aware of that,” remarked Lavretsky."

Go.","‘So she’s not letting the grass grow under her feet. Shurochka, I see you want to run about the garden. Off with you!’","“Well, she’s ready for anything. Shurotchka, I see you want a run in the garden—run along.”"
"– Конечно, – возразил Лаврецкий, – но не лучше ли нам быть в своем семейном кружке?","“Of course,” Lavretsky objected, “but wouldn’t it be better for us to be in our family circle?","‘Of course,’ Lavretsky replied, ‘but wouldn’t it be best to keep it just in the family?’","“Yes,” replied Lavretsky, “but would it not be better to be just a family party?”"
"– Зачем же после? – вмешалась Марья Дмитриевна, – отчего же не теперь?","Why after? intervened Marya Dmitrievna, “why not now?",‘Why later on?’ interposed Marya Dmitrievna. ‘Why not now?’,"“Why later on?” interposed Marya Dmitrievna, “why not now?”"
"– Извините меня, государь мой, – возразила Марфа Тимофеевна, – не заметила вас на радости. На мать ты свою похож стал, на голубушку, – продолжала она, снова обратившись к Лаврецкому, – только нос у тебя отцовский был, отцовским и остался. Ну – и надолго ты к нам?","“Excuse me, my lord,” objected Marfa Timofeevna, “I didn’t notice you in my joy. You have become like your mother, like a little dove,” she went on, turning again to Lavretsky, “only your nose was your father’s, and it remains your father’s. Well, how long are you with us?","‘Forgive me, my good sir,’ responded Marfa Timofeyevna, ‘I didn’t notice you in my state of elation. You’ve begun to look like your mother, the darling child,’ she continued, addressing herself again to Lavretsky, ‘only your nose was your father’s and your father’s it’s remained. Well now, have you come to visit us for long?’","“Pardon me, sir,” replied Marfa Timofyevna, “for not observing you in my delight. You have grown like your mother, the poor darling,” she went on turning again to Lavretsky, “but your nose was always your father’s, and your father’s it has remained. Well, and are you going to be with us for long?”"
"Лиза задумалась. Лаврецкий заговорил о своем житье-бытье в Васильевском, о Михалевиче, об Антоне; он чувствовал потребность говорить с Лизой, сообщить ей все, что приходило ему в душу: она так мило, так внимательно его слушала; ее редкие замечания и возражения казались ему так просты и умны. Он даже сказал ей это. Лиза удивилась.","Lisa thought. Lavretsky spoke of his life in Vasilyevsky, of Mikhalevich, of Anton; he felt the need to talk to Liza, to tell her everything that came into his soul: she was so sweet, she listened to him so attentively; her rare remarks and objections seemed to him so simple and clever. He even told her this. Lisa was surprised.","Liza became thoughtful. Lavretsky began talking about his day-to-day existence in Vasilyevskoye, about Mikhalevich and Anton; he felt a need to talk to Liza, to tell her everything he thought and felt: she listened to him so charmingly and attentively; her occasional remarks and objections seemed to him so unaffected and intelligent.

He even told her so. Lisa was surprised."
"– Да, – возразила Марья Дмитриевна и отпила немного воды. – Я узнала, что вы прошли прямо к тетушке; я приказала вас просить к себе: мне нужно переговорить с вами. Садитесь, пожалуйста. – Марья Дмитриевна перевела дыхание. – Вы знаете, – продолжала она, – ваша жена приехала.","“Yes,” objected Marya Dmitrievna, and drank some water. “I learned that you went straight to your aunt; I ordered you to ask me: I need to talk to you. Sit down please. Marya Dmitrievna took a breath. “You know,” she continued, “your wife has arrived.","‘Yes,’ said Marya Dmitrievna and drank a little of the water. ‘ I learned that you had gone straight up to auntie’s room; I said that you should be asked to come and see me : I have something to discuss with you.

Sit down, please,” Marya Dmitrievna took breath. “You know,” she went on, “your wife has come.”"
"Полчаса спустя Лаврецкий стоял уже перед калиткой сада. Он нашел ее запертою и принужден был перепрыгнуть через забор. Он вернулся в город и пошел по заснувшим улицам. Чувство неожиданной, великой радости наполняло его душу; все сомнения в нем замерли. «Исчезни, прошедшее, темный призрак, – думал он, – она меня любит, она будет моя». Вдруг ему почудилось, что в воздухе над его головою разлились какие-то дивные, торжествующие звуки; он остановился: звуки загремели еще великолепней; певучим, сильным потоком струились они, – и в них, казалось, говорило и пело все его счастье. Он оглянулся: звуки неслись из двух верхних окон небольшого дома.","Half an hour later Lavretsky was already standing in front of the garden gate. He found it locked and was forced to jump over the fence. He returned to the city and walked through the sleepy streets. A feeling of unexpected, great joy filled his soul; all his doubts vanished. Disappear, past, dark ghost, he thought, she loves me, she will be mine. Suddenly it seemed to him that in the air above his head some wondrous, triumphant sounds were poured; he stopped: the sounds thundered even more magnificently; they flowed in a melodious, powerful stream, and all his happiness seemed to speak and sing in them. He looked around: sounds were coming from the two upper windows of the small house.","Half an hour later Lavretsky was already standing by the garden gate. He found it locked and was obliged to jump over the fence. He returned to town and walked through the sleeping streets.

He looked around: the sounds came from the two upper windows of a small house.","Half an hour later Lavretsky was standing before the little garden gate.

He stood still. The music resounded in still greater magnificence; a mighty flood of melody—and all his bliss seemed speaking and singing in its strains. He looked about him; the music floated down from two upper windows of a small house."
"– А! Федя! – начала она, как только увидала его. – Вчера вечером ты не видел моей семьи: полюбуйся. Мы все к чаю собрались; это у нас второй, праздничный чай. Всех поласкать можешь; только Шурочка не дастся, а кот оцарапает. Ты сегодня едешь?","- BUT! Fedya! she began as soon as she saw him. “You didn’t see my family last night: take a look. We all gathered for tea; This is our second celebratory tea. You can caress everyone; only Shurochka will not give in, and the cat will scratch. Are you eating today?","‘Ah! Fedya!’ she began as soon as she saw him. ‘ Yesterday evening you didn’t see my family – take a look at them now. We’re all gathered here for tea; this is our second, our Sunday tea.

– Как же так?,- How so?,"‘How did it happen, then?’",“How then?”
"Марья Дмитриевна опять до того смешалась, что даже выпрямилась и руки развела. Паншин пришел ей на помощь и вступил в разговор с Лаврецким. Марья Дмитриевна успокоилась, опустилась на спинку кресел и лишь изредка вставляла свое словечко; но при этом так жалостливо глядела на своего гостя, так значительно вздыхала и так уныло покачивала головой, что тот, наконец, не вытерпел и довольно резко опросил ее: здорова ли она?","Marya Dmitrievna was again so confused that she even straightened up and spread her arms. Panshin came to her aid and entered into a conversation with Lavretsky. Marya Dmitrievna calmed down, sank into the back of her chair, and only occasionally put in her little word; but at the same time she looked so pitifully at her guest, sighed so significantly, and shook her head so despondently, that he finally could not stand it and quite sharply asked her: is she well?","Marya Dmitrievna was again so put out that she straightened herself in her chair and spread her hands wide. Panshin came to her aid and engaged Lavretsky in conversation. Marya Dmitrievna grew calmer, sank back into her armchair and only made occasional contributions to the conversation; but all the while she looked so pityingly at her guest, sighed so meaningfully and gave such despondent shakes of the head that he could finally stand it no longer and asked her fairly sharply whether she was all right.","Marya Dmitrievna was again thrown into such a state of agitation that she became quite stiff, and her hands hung lifeless by her sides. Panshin came to her support by entering into conversation with Lavretsky. Marya Dmitrievna regained her composure, she leaned back in her arm-chair and now and then put in a word. But she looked all the while with such sympathy at her guest, sighed so significantly, and shook her head so dejectedly, that the latter at last lost patience and asked her rather sharply if she was unwell."
"– Это очень похвально, бесспорно, – возразил Паншин, – и мне сказывали, что вы уже большие сделали успехи по этой части; но согласитесь, что не всякий способен на такого рода занятия.","- This is very commendable, no doubt, - objected Panshin, - and I was told that you have already made great progress in this area; but you must admit that not everyone is capable of such occupations.","‘That’s very praiseworthy, no doubt of it,’ retorted Panshin, ‘and I’m told you’ve already made great strides in that direction; but you will agree that not everyone is capable of that kind of activity.’","“That is very praiseworthy, no doubt,” rejoined Panshin, “and I have been told that you have already had great success in that line; but you must allow that not every one is fit for pursuits of that kind.”"
"– Это ничего, – оказал он по-русски и потом прибавил на родном своем языке: – но он не может ничего понимать; как вы этого не видите? Он дилетант – и все тут!","“That’s nothing,” he said in Russian and then added in his native language: “but he can’t understand anything; how can you not see it? He is an amateur - and that's it!","‘It doesn’t matter,’ he said in Russian, and then added in his own language: ‘But he cannot understand anything; can’t you see that? He’s a dilettante – that’s all there is to it!’","“It’s no matter,” he said in Russian, and then added in his own language, “ but he cannot understand anything; how is it you don’t see that? He’s a dilettante— and that’s all!”"
"– Федор Иваныч не простил меня; он не хотел меня выслушать… Но он был так добр, что назначил мне Лаврики местом жительства.",- Fedor Ivanovich did not forgive me; he did not want to listen to me...

But he was so kind that he assigned me Lavriki as a place to live.’,“Fedor Ivanitch has not forgiven me; he would not hear me. But he was so good as to assign me Lavriky as a place of residence.”
"– Марья Дмитриевна, – произнес вдруг Лаврецкий, – позвольте вас спросить, для чего вы это все мне говорить изволите?","“Marya Dmitrievna,” Lavretsky said suddenly, “permit me to ask you, why are you telling me all this?”","‘Marya Dmitrievna,’ Lavretsky suddenly said, ‘allow me to ask you why you’ve been good enough to say all this to me?’","“Marya Dmitrievna,” Lavretsky blurted out suddenly, “allow me to ask you what is your object in talking to me like this?”"
"Лаврецкий долго не мог заговорить: он чувствовал, что не владел собою; он видел ясно, что Варвара Павловна нисколько его не боялась, а показывала вид, что вот сейчас в обморок упадет.","Lavretsky could not speak for a long time: he felt that he was not in control of himself; he clearly saw that Varvara Pavlovna was not in the least afraid of him, but showed an air that she was about to faint.","It took Lavretsky some while to begin speaking: he felt that he had no control of himself and he clearly saw that Varvara Pavlovna was not in the least frightened of him, though she pretended to be on the point of fainting.","For some time Lavretsky could not speak; he felt that he could not master himself, he saw clearly that Varvara Pavlovna was not in the least afraid of him, but was assuming an appearance of being ready to faint away in another instant."
"Настало утро; оба они поднялись. Странными глазами поглядели они друг на друга. Лаврецкому хотелось в этот миг убить себя. Кухарка Катрин принесла им скверного кофе. Пробило восемь часов. Лемм надел шляпу и, сказавши, что урок он дает у Калитиных в десять часов, но что он найдет приличный предлог, отправился. Лаврецкий опять бросился на диванчик, и опять со дна его души зашевелился горестный смех. Он думал о том, как жена выгнала его из дому; он представлял себе положение Лизы, закрывал глаза и закидывал руки за голову. Наконец Лемм вернулся и принес ему клочок бумаги, на котором Лиза начертила карандашом следующие слова: «Мы сегодня не можем видеться; может быть – завтра вечером. Прощайте». Лаврецкий сухо и рассеянно поблагодарил Лемма и пошел к себе домой.","Morning has come; they both got up. They looked at each other with strange eyes. Lavretsky wanted to kill himself at that moment. Catherine the cook brought them bad coffee. It has struck eight o'clock. Lemm put on his hat and, saying that he was giving a lesson at the Kalitins at ten o'clock, but that he would find a decent pretext, set off. Lavretsky again threw himself on the sofa, and again from the depths of his soul a rueful laugh began to stir. He thought about how his wife had kicked him out of the house; he imagined Lisa's situation, closed his eyes and threw his hands behind his head. Finally, Lemm returned and brought him a piece of paper, on which Lisa had drawn the following words in pencil: “We cannot see each other today; maybe tomorrow evening. Farewell"". Lavretsky thanked Lemm drily and absent-mindedly and went to his house.","Morning came; they both got up. They looked at each other with strange eyes. At that moment Lavretsky wanted to kill himself.

Lavretsky again flung himself down on the little divan, and again bitter laughter rose from the depths of his soul. He thought how his wife had driven him out of his house; he imagined to himself Liza’s position, closed his eyes and folded his hands behind his head. Eventually Lemm returned and brought him a scrap of paper on which Liza had pencilled the following words: ‘We can’t see each other today; perhaps tomorrow evening. Good-bye.’ Lavretsky gave Lemm his dry, confused thanks and went off to his own house.","The morning came; they both got up. With strange eyes they looked at one another.

Good-bye.” Lavretsky thanked Lemm briefly and indifferently, and went home."
"Лиза взглянула на мать, а Марья Дмитриевна приняла болезненный вид; но Лаврецкий не дал ей разинуть рта и тут же поцеловал у ней обе руки. Марья Дмитриевна, всегда чувствительная на ласку и уже вовсе не ожидавшая такой любезности от «тюленя», умилилась душою и согласилась. Пока она соображала, какой бы назначить день; Лаврецкий подошел к Лизе и, все еще взволнованный, украдкой шепнул ей: «Спасибо, вы добрая девушка; я виноват…» И ее бледное лицо заалелось веселой и стыдливой улыбкой; глаза ее тоже улыбнулись, – она до того мгновенья боялась, не оскорбила ли она его.","Liza glanced at her mother, and Marya Dmitrievna assumed a sickly air; but Lavretsky did not let her open her mouth, and immediately kissed both her hands. Marya Dmitrievna, always sensitive to affection and no longer expecting such courtesy from the ""seal"", was touched by her soul and agreed. While she thought about what day to appoint; Lavretsky went up to Liza and, still agitated, furtively whispered to her: “Thank you, you are a kind girl; I am to blame…” And her pale face turned red with a cheerful and bashful smile; her eyes smiled too, for up to that moment she had been afraid that she might have offended him.","Liza glanced at her mother, while Marya Dmitrievna assumed a pained look; but Lavretsky gave her no chance to open her mouth and there and then kissed her on both hands.

While she was considering which day to choose, Lavretsky went up to Liza and, still overwrought, furtively whispered to her: ‘Thank you, you’re a kind girl; I’m to blame…’ And her pale face crimsoned with a happy, ashamed smile; her eyes also smiled – until that moment she was afraid she had offended him.","Lisa looked towards her mother; Marya Dmitrievna was assuming an expression of suffering; but Lavretsky did not give her time to open her mouth; he at once kissed both her hands.

While she was deliberating which day to fix, Lavretsky went up to Lisa, and, still greatly moved, whispered to her aside: “ Thank you, you are a good girl; I was to blame.” And her pale face glowed with a bright, shy smile; her eyes smiled too—up to that instant she had been afraid she had offended him."
"Христофор Теодор Готлиб Лемм родился в 1786 году, в королевстве Саксонском, в городе Хемнице, от бедных музыкантов. Отец его играл на валторне, мать на арфе; сам он уже по пятому году упражнялся на трех различных инструментах. Восьми лет он осиротел, а с десяти начал зарабатывать себе кусок хлеба своим искусством. Он долго вел бродячую жизнь, играл везде – ив трактирах, и на ярмарках, и на крестьянских свадьбах, и на балах; наконец попал в оркестр и, подвигаясь все выше и выше, достиг дирижерского места. Исполнитель он был довольно плохой, но музыку знал основательно. На двадцать восьмом году переселился он в Россию. Его выписал большой барин, который сам терпеть не мог музыки, но держал оркестр из чванства. Лемм прожил у него лет семь в качестве капельмейстера и отошел от него с пустыми руками: барин разорился, хотел дать ему на себя вексель, но впоследствии отказал ему и в этом, – словом, не заплатил ему ни копейки. Ему советовали уехать; но он не хотел вернуться домой – нищим из России, из великой России, этого золотого дна артистов; он решился остаться и испытать свое счастье. В течение двадцати лет бедный немец пытал свое счастье: побывал у различных господ, жил и в Москве, и в губернских городах, терпел и сносил многое, узнал нищету, бился как рыба об лед; но мысль о возвращении на родину не покидала его среди всех бедствий, которым он подвергался; она только одна его и поддерживала. Судьбе, однако, не было угодно порадовать его этим последним и первым счастьем: пятидесяти лет, больной, до времени одряхлевший, застрял он в городе О… и остался в нем навсегда, уже окончательно потеряв всякую надежду покинуть ненавистную ему Россию и кое-как поддерживая уроками свое скудное существование. Наружность Лемма не располагала в его пользу. Он был небольшого роста, сутуловат, с криво выдавшимися лопатками и втянутым животом, с большими плоскими ступнями, с бледно-синими ногтями на твердых, не разгибавшихся пальцах жилистых красных рук; лицо имел морщинистое, впалые щеки и сжатые губы, которыми он беспрестанно двигал и жевал, что, при его обычной молчаливости, производило впечатление почти зловещее; седые его волосы висели клочьями над невысоким лбом; как только что залитые угольки, глухо тлели его крошечные, неподвижные глазки; ступал он тяжело, на каждом шагу перекидывая свое неповоротливое тело. Иные его движения напоминали неуклюжее охорашивание совы в клетке, когда она чувствует, что на нее глядят, а сама едва видит своими огромными, желтыми, пугливо и дремотно моргающими глазами. Застарелое, неумолимое горе положило на бедного музикуса свою неизгладимую печать, искривило и обезобразило его и без того невзрачную фигуру; но для того, кто умел не останавливаться на первых впечатлениях, что-то доброе, честное, что-то необыкновенное виднелось в этом полуразрушенном существе. Поклонник Баха и Генделя, знаток своего дела, одаренный живым воображением и той смелостью мысли, которая доступна одному германскому племени, Лемм со временем – кто знает? – стал бы в ряду великих композиторов своей родины, если б жизнь иначе его повела; но не под счастливой звездой он родился! Он много написал на своем веку – и ему не удалось увидеть ни одного своего произведения изданным; не умел он приняться за дело как следовало, поклониться кстати, похлопотать вовремя. Как-то, давным-давно тому назад, один его поклонник и друг, тоже немец и тоже бедный, издал на свой счет две его сонаты, – да и те остались целиком в подвалах музыкальных магазинов; глухо и бесследно провалились они, словно их ночью кто в реку бросил. Лемм, наконец, махнул рукой на все; притом и годы брали свое: он зачерствел, одеревенел, как пальцы его одеревенели. Один, с старой кухаркой, взятой им из богадельни (он никогда женат не был), проживал он в О… в небольшом домишке, недалеко от калитинского дома; много гулял, читал библию, да собрание протестантских псалмов, да Шекспира в шлегелевском переводе. Он давно ничего не сочинял; но, видно, Лиза, лучшая его ученица, умела его расшевелить: он написал для нее кантату, о которой упомянул Паншин. Слова этой кантаты были им заимствованы из собрания псалмов; некоторые стихи он сам присочинил. Ее пели два хора – хор счастливцев и хор несчастливцев; оба они к концу примирялись и пели вместе: «Боже милостивый, помилуй нас, грешных, и отжени от нас всякие лукавые мысля и земные надежды». На заглавном листе, весьма тщательно написанном и даже разрисованном, стояло: «Только праведные правы. Духовная кантата. Сочинена и посвящена девице Елизавете Калитиной, моей любезной ученице, ее учителем, X. Т. Г. Леммом». Слова: «Только праведные правы» и «Елизавете Калитиной» были окружены лучами. Внизу было приписано: «Для вас одних, fur Sie allein». – Оттого-то Лемм и покраснел и взглянул искоса на Лизу; ему было очень больно, когда Паншин заговорил при нем об его кантате.","Christopher Theodor Gottlieb Lemm was born in 1786, in the Kingdom of Saxony, in the city of Chemnitz, from poor musicians. His father played the horn, his mother the harp; he himself was already in his fifth year practicing on three different instruments. At the age of eight he became an orphan, and from the age of ten he began to earn a piece of bread for himself with his art. He led a wandering life for a long time, playing everywhere - in taverns, and at fairs, and at peasant weddings, and at balls; finally got into the orchestra and, moving higher and higher, reached the conductor's place. He was a rather poor performer, but he knew music thoroughly. In the twenty-eighth year he moved to Russia. He was ordered by a great gentleman who himself could not stand music, but kept the orchestra out of arrogance. Lemm lived with him for seven years as a bandmaster and left him empty-handed: the master went bankrupt, wanted to give him a bill of exchange, but later refused him this too - in a word, he did not pay him a penny. He was advised to leave; but he did not want to return home - a beggar from Russia, from great Russia, this gold mine of artists; he decided to stay and try his luck. For twenty years, the poor German tried his luck: he visited various masters, lived both in Moscow and in provincial cities, endured and endured a lot, learned poverty, fought like a fish on ice; but the thought of returning to his homeland did not leave him in the midst of all the disasters to which he was subjected; She was the only one who supported him. Fate, however, did not please him with this last and first happiness: fifty years old, ill, decrepit for a time, he got stuck in the city of O ... and stayed in it forever, having finally lost all hope of leaving Russia that he hated and somehow supporting lessons from their meager existence. Lemm's outward appearance did not favor him. He was small, round-shouldered, with crookedly protruding shoulder blades and a retracted belly, with large flat feet, with pale blue nails on the hard, unbent fingers of sinewy red hands; his face had wrinkled, sunken cheeks and compressed lips, with which he constantly moved and chewed, which, with his usual silence, produced an almost ominous impression; his gray hair hung in tufts over his low forehead; like freshly filled embers, his tiny, motionless eyes smoldered muffledly; he walked heavily, tossing his clumsy body at every step. Some of his movements were reminiscent of the clumsy preening of an owl in a cage, when she feels that she is being looked at, but she herself can barely see with her huge, yellow, timidly and drowsily blinking eyes. Old, inexorable grief has put its indelible mark on the poor musicus, distorted and disfigured his already unprepossessing figure; but for someone who knew how not to dwell on first impressions, something good, honest, something extraordinary could be seen in this dilapidated creature. An admirer of Bach and Handel, an expert in his field, endowed with a vivid imagination and that boldness of thought that is available to one Germanic tribe, Lemm eventually - who knows? - would have become one of the great composers of his homeland, if life had led him differently; but he was not born under a lucky star! He wrote a lot in his lifetime - and he did not manage to see a single of his works published; he did not know how to get down to business properly, to bow by the way, to plead in time. Somehow, a long time ago, one of his admirers and friends, also a German and also poor, published two of his sonatas at his own expense - and even those remained entirely in the cellars of music stores; they sank dully and without a trace, as if someone had thrown them into the river at night. Lemm finally waved his hand at everything; moreover, the years took their toll: he became callous, stiff, as his fingers were stiff. Alone, with an old cook he had taken from the almshouse (he had never been married), he lived in O ... in a small house, not far from the Kalitinsky house; I walked a lot, read the Bible, and a collection of Protestant psalms, and Shakespeare in Schlegel's translation. He hadn't written anything for a long time; but, apparently, Liza, his best student, knew how to stir him up: he wrote for her the cantata that Panshin mentioned. The words of this cantata were borrowed by him from the collection of psalms; some of the poems he composed himself. It was sung by two choirs - the choir of the fortunate and the choir of the unlucky; both of them were reconciled by the end and sang together: “O merciful God, have mercy on us sinners, and drive away from us all evil thoughts and earthly hopes.” On the title page, very carefully written and even painted, stood: “Only the righteous are right. Spiritual cantata. Composed and dedicated to the maiden Elizaveta Kalitina, my dear student, by her teacher, X. T. G. Lemm. The words: ""Only the righteous are right"" and ""Elizaveta Kalitina"" were surrounded by rays. At the bottom was written: ""For you alone, fur Sie allein."" That's why Lemm blushed and looked askance at Liza; he was very hurt when Panshin spoke in front of him about his cantata.","CHRISTOPHER THEODORE GOTTLIEB LEMM was born in 1786 into a family of penurious musicians in the town of Chemnitz in the Kingdom of Saxony. His father played the French horn, his mother played the harp; by his fifth year he was himself practising three different instruments. At eight he was orphaned and at ten he began earning his daily bread by his playing. For a long time he led a vagrant life, playing everywhere – at inns, at fairs, at peasant weddings and at balls. Finally he found a place in an orchestra and, moving ever higher and higher, eventually became conductor. He was a rather poor performer, but he had a fundamental understanding of music. In his twenty-eighth year he emigrated to Russia. He had been booked by a grandiose member of the gentry who could not endure music but maintained an orchestra for show. Lemm spent seven years as his director of music and left without a penny to show for it: the gentleman in question went bankrupt, wanted to give him an I.O.U. but later refused to give him even that – in short, did not pay him a farthing. He was advised to go abroad; but he did not wish to return home from Russia a beggar, from that great Russia, the gold mine of all artists. He decided to remain and try his luck. The poor German tried his luck for twenty yean: he was employed by various gentlemen, lived both in Moscow and in provincial towns, endured and suffered much, experiencing poverty and struggling for life like a fish out of water. But the idea of returning to his homeland never left him amid all the misfortunes which beset him. That idea alone kept him going. Fate, however, did not think fit to gladden him with this first and last happiness: at fifty, sick and prematurely decrepit, he found himself in the town of O… and remained there forever, having finally abandoned all hope of leaving the Russia that was so hateful to him and relying somehow on his lessons to make a paltry living. Lemm’s appearance was no advantage to him. He was short in stature, round-shouldered, with protuberant bent shoulder-blades and shrunken stomach, large flat feet and pale-blue nails on the stiff, inflexible fingers of his sinewy red hands. He had a wrinkled face, sunken cheeks and compressed lips which were endlessly making a chewing motion that, combined with his usual taciturnity, produced an almost menacing effect. His grey hair hung in tufts over his low forehead. His tiny motionless eyes had a dull glow like recently extinguished coals. He had a ponderous gait, swinging his cumbersome body from side to side at each step. Some of his movements were reminiscent of the preenings of an owl in a cage when it feels it is being watched and yet itself can hardly see out of its large, yellow, fearful and sleepily blinking eyes. Longstanding, implacable grief had left its ineradicable mark upon the poor musician and contorted and disfigured his already unbecoming person; but for those who could see beyond first impressions there was something kindly, honourable and unusual to be discerned in this half-ruined man. A devotee of Bach and Handel, expert at his craft, gifted with a lively imagination and that boldness of thought which is uniquely characteristic of the Germans, Lemm in time – who knows? – might have taken his place among the great composers of his country if life had led him on a different course; but he was not born under an auspicious star. He had written a great deal in his time – and he had not succeeded in seeing a single one of his compositions published; he had no idea how to set about things in the right way, to whom to bow at the right moment or when was the best time to busy himself. Somehow or other, a long time ago, an admirer and friend of his, also a German and also poor, had printed at his own expense two of his sonatas – and yet these remained entirely unsold in the storerooms of music shops; they vanished without sound or trace, literally as if they had been thrown into a river overnight. Lemm finally said goodbye to his dreams; the years, what is more, had taken their toll: he had grown crusty and hard like his fingers. All by himself, save for an old cook-housekeeper he took from the poor-house (he had never married), he lived in O… in a little house not far from the Kalitins’, passing much of his time in taking strolls and reading the Bible, a collection of Protestant psalms and the works of Shakespeare in Schlegel’s translation. It was a long time since he had composed anything new; but clearly Liza, his best pupil, had stirred his creative powers and he had written for her the cantata to which Panshin referred. The words of the cantata had been taken from the collection of psalms, though he had added some verses of his own. It was to be sung by two choirs of the lucky and the luckless – and in the finale they were to be reconciled and sing together: ‘Merciful Lord, forgive us, Thy sinners, and save us from all wicked thoughts and worldly hopes.’ On the title page, in extremely neat lettering and even suitably embellished, was the following: ‘Only the Righteous shall be Justified. A Religious Cantata. Composed and dedicated to my dear pupil, Miss Elizaveta Kalitin, by her teacher, C.T.G. Lemm.’ The words: ‘Only the Righteous shall be Justified’ and ‘Miss Elizaveta Kalitin’ were surrounded by decorative rays. Below had been written: ‘For you alone, für Sie allein.’ This was why Lemm had reddened and looked obliquely at Liza; Panshin’s mention of his cantata in his presence was very painful to him.","Christopher Theodor Gottlieb Lemm was born in 1786 in the town of Chemnitz in Saxony. His parents were poor musicians. His father played the French horn, his mother the harp; he himself was practising on three different instruments by the time he was five. At eight years old he was left an orphan, and from his tenth year he began to earn his bread by his art. He led a wandering life for many years, and performed everywhere in restaurants, at fairs, at peasants’ weddings, and at balls. At last he got into an orchestra and constantly rising in it , he obtained the position of director. He was rather a poor performer; but he understood music thoroughly. At twenty-eight he migrated into Russia, on the invitation of a great nobleman, who did not care for music himself, but kept an orchestra for show. Lemm lived with him seven years in the capacity of orchestra conductor, and left him empty-handed. The nobleman was ruined, he intended to give him a promissory note, but in the sequel refused him even that—in short, did not pay him a farthing. He was advised to go away; but he was unwilling to return home in poverty from Russia, that great Russia which is a mine of gold for artists; he decided to remain and try his luck. For twenty years the poor German had been trying his luck; he had lived in various gentlemen’s houses, had suffered and put up with much, had faced privation, had struggled like a fish on the ice; but the idea of returning to his own country never left him among all the hardships he endured; it was this dream alone that sustained him. But fate did not see fit to grant him this last and first happiness: at fifty, broken-down in health and prematurely aged, he drifted to the town of O——, and remained there for good, having now lost once for all every hope of leaving Russia, which he detested. He gained his poor livelihood somehow by lessons. Lemm’s exterior was not prepossessing. He was short and bent, with crooked shoulders, and contracted chest, with large flat feet, and bluish white nails on the gnarled bony fingers of his sinewy red hands. He had a wrinkled face, sunken cheeks, and compressed lips, which he was for ever twitching and biting; and this, together with his habitual taciturnity, produced an impression almost sinister. His grey hair hung in tufts on his low brow; like smouldering embers, his little set eyes glowed with dull fire. He moved painfully, at every step swinging his ungainly body forward. Some of his movements recalled the clumsy actions of an owl in a cage when it feels that it is being looked at, but itself can hardly see out of its great yellow eyes timorously and drowsily blinking. Pitiless, prolonged sorrow had laid its indelible stamp on the poor musician; it had disfigured and deformed his person, by no means attractive to begin with. But any one who was able to get over the first impression would have discerned something good, and honest, and out of the common in this half-shattered creature. A devoted admirer of Bach and Handel, a master of his art, gifted with a lively imagination and that boldness of conception which is only vouchsafed to the German race, Lemm might, in time—who knows?—have taken rank with the great composers of his fatherland, had his life been different; but he was born under an unlucky star! He had written much in his life, and it had not been granted to him to see one of his compositions produced; he did not know how to set about things in the right way, to gain favour in the right place, and to make a push at the right moment. A long, long time ago, his one friend and admirer, also a German and also poor, had published two of Lemm’s sonatas at his own expense—the whole edition remained on the shelves of the music-shops; they disappeared without a trace, as though they had been thrown into a river by night. At last Lemm had renounced everything; the years too did their work; his mind had grown hard and stiff, as his fingers had stiffened. He lived alone in a little cottage not far from the Kalitin’s house, with an old cook he had taken out of the poorhouse (he had never married). He took long walks, and read the Bible and the Protestant version of the Psalms, and Shakespeare in Schlegel’s translation. He had composed nothing for a long time; but apparently, Lisa, his best pupil, had been able to inspire him; he had written for her the cantata to which Panshin had! made allusion. The words of this cantata he had borrowed from his collection of hymns. He had added a few verses of his own. It was sung by two choruses—a chorus of the happy and a chorus of the unhappy. The two were brought into harmony at the end, and sang together, “Merciful God, have pity on us sinners, and deliver us from all evil thoughts and earthly hopes.” On the title-page was the inscription, most carefully written and even illuminated, “Only the righteous are justified. A religious cantata. Composed and dedicated to Miss Elisaveta Kalitin, his dear pupil, by her teacher, C. T. G. Lemm.” The words, “Only the righteous are justified” and “Elisaveta Kalitin,” were encircled by rays. Below was written: “For you alone, fur Sie allein.” This was why Lemm had grown red, and looked reproachfully at Lisa; he was deeply wounded when Panshin spoke of his cantata before him."
"В тот вечер, о котором зашла у нас речь, обитатели калитинского дома (старшему из них, жениху Леночки, было всего двадцать четыре года) занимались немногосложной, но, судя по их дружному хохотанью, весьма для них забавной игрой: они бегали по комнатам и ловили друг друга; собаки тоже бегали и лаяли, и висевшие в клетках перед окнами канарейки наперерыв драли горло, усиливал всеобщий гам звонкой трескотней своего яростного щебетанья. В самый разгар этой оглушительной потехи к воротам подъехал загрязненный тарантас, и человек лет сорока пяти, в дорожном платье, вылез из него и остановился в изумленье. Он постоял некоторое время неподвижно, окинул дом внимательным взором, вошел через калитку на двор и медленно взобрался на крыльцо. В передней никто его не встретил; но дверь залы быстро распахнулась – из нее, вся раскрасневшаяся, выскочила Шурочка, и мгновенно, вслед за ней, с звонким криком выбежала вся молодая ватага. Она внезапно остановилась и затихла при виде незнакомого; но светлые глаза, устремленные на него, глядели так же ласково, свежие лица не перестали смеяться. Сын Марья Дмитриевны подошел к гостю и приветливо опросил его, что ему угодно?","On that evening, which we are talking about, the inhabitants of the Kalitinsky house (the eldest of them, Lenochka's fiancé, was only twenty-four years old) were engaged in a little complicated, but, judging by their friendly laughter, a very amusing game for them: they ran around the rooms and caught each other; the dogs also ran and barked, and the canaries hanging in cages in front of the windows vied with each other, tearing their throats, intensifying the universal uproar with the ringing rattle of their furious chirping. In the midst of this deafening fun, a soiled chariot drove up to the gate, and a man of about forty-five, in a travel dress, got out of it and stopped in amazement. He stood motionless for a while, looked around the house with an attentive glance, entered through the gate into the yard, and slowly climbed up onto the porch. No one met him in the hall; but the door of the hall quickly swung open - Shurochka jumped out of it, all flushed, and instantly, after her, with a ringing cry, the whole young crowd ran out. She suddenly stopped and fell silent at the sight of a stranger; but the bright eyes fixed on him looked just as kindly, the fresh faces did not stop laughing. Marya Dmitrievna's son went up to the guest and amiably asked him what he wanted?","On that evening, of which we have just spoken, the inhabitants of the Kalitin house (the eldest of them, Lenochka’s fiancé, was only twenty-four years old) were engaged in a slightly complicated but, judging by their concerted laughter, to them extremely amusing game: they were running from room to room and catching each other; the dogs were also running about and barking, and the canaries in the cages hanging by the windows strained their throats to bursting, adding to die general commotion with the loud cacophony of their frantic trilling. At the very height of this deafening fun a muddy tarantass drove up to the gates and a man of about forty-five, in a travelling cloak, stepped out of it and stopped in astonishment. He stood there for a short while, encompassed the house with his attentive gaze, entered the courtyard through the little gate and slowly climbed the porch steps. He met nobody in the hall; but the door of the dining-room was flung open and out of it dashed a red-faced Shurochka, followed an instant later, with loud shouts, by the whole party of young people. They stopped suddenly and fell quiet at the sight of the stranger; but the bright eyes directed at him did not lose their kindly look and the fresh faces did not cease their laughter. Marya Dmitrievna’s son approached the new arrival and hospitably asked him what he wanted.","On the evening of which we are speaking, the inhabitants of the Kalitins’ house (the eldest of them, Lenotchka’s betrothed, was only twenty-four) were engaged in a game, which, though not of a very complicated nature, was, to judge from their merry laughter, exceedingly entertaining to them; they were running about the rooms, chasing one another; the dogs, too, were running and barking, and the canaries, hanging in cages above the windows, were straining their throats in rivalry and adding to the general uproar by the shrill trilling of their piercing notes. At the very height of this deafening merry-making a mud-bespattered carriage stopped at the gate, and a man of five-and forty, in a travelling dress, stepped out of it and stood still in amazement. He stood a little time without stirring, watching the house with attentive eyes; then went through the little gate in the courtyard, and slowly mounted the steps. In the hall he met no one; but the door of a room was suddenly! flung open, and out of it rushed Shurotchka, flushed and hot, and instantly, with a ringing shout, all the young party in pursuit of her. They stopped short at once and were quiet at the sight of a stranger; but their clear eyes fixed on him wore the same friendly expression, and their fresh faces were still smiling as Marya Dmitreivna’s son went up to the visitor and asked him cordially what he could do for him."
– Да.,- Yes.,‘I am.’,“Yes.”
"– Какая у него чудесная лошадь! – продолжала девочка. – Он сейчас был у калитки и сказал нам с Лизой, что к крыльцу подъедет.",What a wonderful horse he has! the girl continued. - He was at the gate just now and told Liza and me that he would drive up to the porch.,‘What a wonderful horse he has!’ the little girl continued. ‘ He was by the gate a moment ago and told Liza and me he’d ride right up to the porch.’,"“What a splendid horse he has!” continued the little girl. “He was at the gate just now, he told Lisa and me he would dismount at the steps.”"
"– Это все надо забыть, – проговорила Лиза, – я рада, что вы пришли; я хотела вам написать, но этак лучше. Только надо скорее пользоваться этими минутами. Нам обоим остается исполнить наш долг. Вы, Федор Иваныч, должны примириться с вашей женой.","“All this must be forgotten,” Liza said, “I am glad that you have come; I wanted to write to you, but that way is better. You just need to make the most of these moments. We both have to do our duty. You, Fyodor Ivanovich, must reconcile with your wife.","‘It must all be forgotten,’ said Liza. ‘I’m glad you’ve come. I wanted to write to you, but it’s better this way. Only we’ve got to make the most of these minutes. It remains for both of us now to do our duty. You, Fyodor Ivanych, must be reconciled with your wife.’","“We must forget all that,” Lisa brought out; “I am glad that you have come; I wanted to write to you, but it is better so. Only we must take advantage quickly of these minutes. It is left for both of us to do our duty. You, Fedor Ivanitch, must be reconciled with your wife.”"
"– Глядит таким смиренником, – начала она снова, – голова вся седая, а что рот раскроет, то солжет или насплетничает. А еще статский советник! Ну, и то оказать: попович!","“He looks so humble,” she began again, “his head is all gray, and if he opens his mouth, he will lie or gossip. And also a state adviser! Well, and then to show: priest!","‘He looks so inoffensive,’ she began again, ‘with all his grey hair, but as soon as he opens his mouth he either tells lies or spreads scandal – and he’s a councillor, mind you! Well, it’s only to be expected; after all, he’s the son of a priest!’","“He looks so meek and mild,” she began again, “with his grey head, but he no sooner opens his mouth than out comes a lie or a slander. And to think of his having the rank of a councillor! To be sure, though, he’s only a village priest’s son.”"
"На другой день Лаврецкий встал довольно рано, потолковал со старостой, побывал на гумне, велел снять цепь с дворовой собаки, которая только полаяла немного, но даже не отошла от своей конуры, – и, вернувшись домой, погрузился в какое-то мирное оцепенение, из которого не выходил целый день. «Вот когда я попал на самое дно реки», – сказал он самому себе не однажды. Он сидел под окном, не шевелился и словно прислушивался к теченью тихой жизни, которая его окружала, к редким звукам деревенской глуши. Вот где-то за крапивой кто-то напевает тонким-тонким голоском; комар словно вторит ему. Вот он перестал, а комар все пищит: сквозь дружное, назойливо жалобное жужжанье мух раздается гуденье толстого шмеля, который то и дело стучится головой о потолок; петух на улице закричал, хрипло вытягивая последнюю ноту, простучала телега, на деревне скрыпят ворота. «Чего?» – задребезжал вдруг бабий голос. «Ох ты, мой сударик», – говорит Антон двухлетней девочке, которую нянчит на руках. «Квас неси», – повторяет тот же бабий голос, – и вдруг находит тишина мертвая; ничто не стукнет, не шелохнется; ветер листком не шевельнет; ласточки несутся без крика одна за другой по земле, и печально становится на душе от их безмолвного налета. «Вот когда я на дне реки, – думает опять Лаврецкий. – И всегда, во всякое время тиха и неспешна здесь жизнь, – думает он, – кто входит в ее круг – покоряйся: здесь незачем волноваться, нечего мутить; здесь только тому и удача, кто прокладывает свою тропинку не торопясь, как пахарь борозду плугом. И какая сила кругом, какое здоровье в этой бездейственной тиши! Вот тут, под окном, коренастый лопух лезет из густой травы; над ним вытягивает зоря свой сочный стебель, богородицыны слезки еще выше выкидывают свои розовые кудри; а там, дальше, в полях, лоснится рожь, и овес уже пошел в трубочку, и ширится во всю ширину свою каждый лист на каждом дереве, каждая травка на своем стебле. На женскую любовь ушли мои лучшие года, – продолжает думать Лаврецкий, – пусть же вытрезвит меня здесь скука, пусть успокоит меня, подготовит к тому, чтобы и я умел не спеша делать дело». И он снова принимается прислушиваться к тишине, ничего не ожидая – и в то же время как будто беспрестанно ожидая чего-то; тишина обнимает его со всех сторон, солнце катится тихо по спокойному синему небу, и облака тихо плывут по нем; кажется, они знают, куда и зачем они плывут. В то самое время в других местах на земле кипела, торопилась, грохотала жизнь; здесь та же жизнь текла неслышно, как вода по болотным травам; и до самого вечера Лаврецкий не мог оторваться от созерцания этой уходящей, утекающей жизни; скорбь о прошедшем таяла в его душе, как весенний снег, и – странное дело! – никогда не было в нем так глубоко и сильно чувство родины.","The next day, Lavretsky got up quite early, talked to the headman, visited the threshing floor, ordered the yard dog to be unchained, which only barked a little, but did not even move away from its kennel, and, returning home, plunged into a kind of peaceful stupor, from which he did not leave the whole day. “That's when I hit the bottom of the river,” he said to himself more than once. He sat under the window, did not move, and seemed to be listening to the flow of the quiet life that surrounded him, to the rare sounds of the rural wilderness. Here, somewhere behind the nettles, someone is singing in a thin, thin voice; the mosquito seems to echo him. So he stopped, and the mosquito kept squeaking: through the friendly, importunately plaintive buzzing of flies, there is a buzz of a fat bumblebee, which now and then knocks its head on the ceiling; a rooster crowed in the street, hoarsely drawing out the last note, a cart rattled, the gates were hidden in the village. ""What?"" suddenly rattled a woman's voice. “Oh, my sir,” Anton says to a two-year-old girl, whom she nurses in her arms. “Bring kvass,” repeats the same woman’s voice, “and suddenly there is a dead silence; nothing will knock, nothing will stir; the wind does not move the leaf; the swallows rush without a cry one after another over the earth, and the soul becomes sad from their silent raid. “That’s when I’m at the bottom of the river,” Lavretsky thinks again. - And always, at all times, life is quiet and unhurried here, - he thinks, - whoever enters its circle - submit: there is nothing to worry about, nothing to stir up; here only he is lucky who paves his path slowly, like a plowman furrows with a plow. And what strength is all around, what health in this inactive stillness! Here, under the window, a stocky burdock climbs out of the thick grass; above him the dawn stretches its juicy stalk, the tears of the Mother of God throw out their pink curls even higher; and there, farther, in the fields, the rye is shining, and the oats have already gone into a tube, and every leaf on every tree, every grass on its stem, is expanding to its full width. My best years have gone into womanly love, - Lavretsky continues to think, - let boredom sober me up here, let me calm down, prepare me so that I too can do things slowly. And he again begins to listen to the silence, not expecting anything - and at the same time, as if constantly waiting for something; silence embraces him from all sides, the sun rolls quietly across the calm blue sky, and the clouds float silently across it; they seem to know where and why they are swimming. At the same time, in other places on earth, life was seething, hurrying, rumbling; here the same life flowed inaudibly, like water over swamp grasses; and until the very evening Lavretsky could not tear himself away from the contemplation of this departing, flowing life; sorrow for the past melted in his soul like spring snow, and—strange thing! – never was in it so deeply and strongly feeling of the native land.","THE next day Lavretsky rose fairly early, chatted with the village elder, visited the threshing-floor, ordered the chain to be taken off the dog in the yard, who only barked a little but did not even leave his kennel, and then returned home to sink into a kind of peaceful torpor from which he did not emerge all day. ‘Here’s the point where I’ve fallen to the bottom of the river,’ he said to himself more than once. He sat at the window without stirring a muscle, literally absorbed in listening to the flow of the quiet life surrounding him and the occasional sounds of the peaceful rural world. Somewhere beyond the nettles someone hummed a melody in the finest of thin voices, and a gnat seemed to take up the refrain. The voice ceased, but the gnat continued to hum: through the concerted, naggingly plaintive buzzing of flies there resounded the droning of a fat bumble-bee which now and then tapped against the ceiling; a cock started crowing in the street, wheezily prolonging its final crowing note; a cart rattled by and in the village a gate creaked. ‘What’ sat?’ a woman’s voice suddenly screeched. ‘Oh, you’re a little madam!’ said Anton to the two-year-old girl he was dandling in his arms. ‘ Bring the kvass,’ repeated the same woman’s voice – and suddenly dead silence ensued; nothing tapped, nothing stirred; one by one swallows swooped along the ground without a murmur, and the very silence of their flight made the heart sad. ‘Here am I as though I were at the bottom of a river,’ Lavretsky thought again. ‘ And here always, at all times, life is quiet and unhurried,’ he reflected. ‘Whoever enters its charmed circle must submit to it: here there is nothing to worry about, nothing to disturb one; here success comes only to him who carves out his own unhurried path as the ploughman carves out the furrows with his plough. And what strength there is everywhere, what vigour in this static peace! Just there, beneath the window, a rugged burdock shoves its way through the thick grass; above it lovage stretches its juicy stalk, angels’ tears unfurls its rosy curls higher still; and there, further off, in the fields, the rye gleams brightly burnished, and the oats have formed their little trumpet ears, and every leaf on every tree, and every blade of grass on its stalk, has broadened out to its fullest breadth. My best years have passed in loving a woman,’ Lavretsky continued to reflect. ‘Now let this boredom bring me to my senses, let it calm me and prepare me to take up my task without hurry.’ And once again he began to listen to the silence, awaiting nothing – and yet at the same time endlessly expectant: the silence engulfed him on every side; the sun ran its course across the tranquil blue of the sky, and the clouds floated silently upon it; it seemed as if they knew why and where they were going. At that very time, in other places on the earth, life was seething, hurrying, roaring on its way; here the same life flowed by inaudibly, like water through marshy grass; and until evening Lavretsky could not tear himself away from contemplation of this receding, outflowing life; anguish for the past was melting in his soul like spring snow and – strangest of all! – never before had he felt so deep and strong a feeling for his country.","The next day Lavretsky got up rather early, had a talk with the village bailiff, visited the threshing-floor, ordered the chain to be taken off the yard dog, who only barked a little but did not even come out of his kennel, and returning home, sank into a kind of peaceful torpor, which he did not shake off the whole day. “Here I am at the very bottom of the river,” he said to himself more than once. He sat at the window without stirring, and, as it were, listened to the current of the quiet life surrounding him, to the few sounds of the country solitude. Something from behind the nettles chirps with a shrill, shrill little note; a gnat seems to answer it. Now it has ceased, but still the gnat keeps up its sharp whirr; across the pleasant, persistent, fretful buzz of the flies sounds the hum of a big bee, constantly knocking its head against the ceiling; a cock crows in the street, hoarsely prolonging the last note; there is the rattle of a cart; in the village a gate is creaking. Then the jarring voice of a peasant woman, “What?” “Hey, you are my little sweetheart,” cries Anton to the little two-year-old girl he is dandling in his arms. “Fetch the kvas,” repeats the same woman’s voice, and all at once there follows a deathly silence; nothing rattles, nothing is moving; the wind is not stirring a leaf; without a sound the swallows fly one after another over the earth, and sadness weights on the heart from their noiseless flight. “Here I am at the very bottom of the river,” thought Lavretsky again. “And always, at all times life here is quiet, unhasting,” he thought; “whoever comes within its circle must submit; here there is nothing to agitate, nothing to harass; one can only get on here by making one’s way slowly, as the ploughman cuts the furrow with his plough. And what vigour, what health abound in this inactive place! Here under the window the sturdy burdock creeps out of the thick grass; above it the lovage trails its juicy stalks and the Virgin ’s tears fling still higher their pink tendrils; and yonder further in the fields is the silky rye, and the oats are already in ear, and every leaf on every tree, every grass on its stalk is spread to its fullest width. In the love of a woman my best years have gone by,” Lavretsky went on thinking, “let me be sobered by the sameness of life here, let me be soothed and made ready, so that I may learn to do my duty without haste.” And again he fell to listening to the silence, expecting nothing—and at the same time constantly expecting something; the silence enfolded him on all sides, the sun moved calmly in the peaceful blue sky, and the clouds sailed calmly across it; they seemed to know why and whither they were sailing. At this same time in other places on the earth there is the seething, the bustle, the clash of life; life here slipped by noiseless, as water over marshy grass; and even till evening Lavretsky could not tear himself from the contemplation of this life as it passed and glided by; sorrow for the past was melting in his soul like snow in spring, and strange to say, never had the feeling of home been so deep and strong within him."
"– Отчего же странный? Я спрашиваю о нем у вас как человек, недавно сюда приехавший, как родственник.","- Why is it strange?

– А что же ваша дочь? – спросила вдруг Лиза и остановилась. Лаврецкий встрепенулся.,- And what about your daughter? Liza suddenly asked and stopped.

Lavretsky started."

We’re sleeping while time’s passing away; we’re sleeping…’","“And what a time, what a place for men to think of loafing!” he cried at four o’clock, in a voice, however, which showed signs of sleepiness; “among us! now! in Russia where every separate individual has a duty resting upon him, a solemn responsibility to God, to the people, to himself. We are sleeping, and the time is slipping away; we are sleeping.” ...."

"– Послушайте, – сказал он, – не будемте больше говорить обо мне; станемте разыгрывать нашу сонату. Об одном только прошу я вас, – прибавил он, разглаживая рукою листы лежавшей на пюпитре тетради, – думайте обо мне что хотите, называйте меня даже эгоистом – так и быть! но не называйте меня светским человеком: эта кличка мне нестерпима… Anch'io sono pittore[6].

Anch ‘io sono pittore. I too am an artist, though a poor one—and that —I mean that I’m a poor artist, I shall show directly. Let us begin.”"
"– Что с вами? – промолвил Лаврецкий и услышал тихое рыдание. Сердце его захолонуло… Он понял, что значили эти слезы. – Неужели вы меня любите? – прошептал он и коснулся ее коленей.","- What's wrong with you? said Lavretsky, and heard a soft sob. His heart sank… He understood what those tears meant. - Do you love me? he whispered and touched her knees.","‘What’s wrong?’ asked Lavretsky and heard her quiet weeping. His heart missed a beat. He realized what these tears meant. ‘You’re in love with me, aren’t you?’ he whispered and touched her knees.","Lavretsky urged, and he heard a subdued sob. His heart stood still....

I’m not going to tell you that, my good chap, because everyone should know that,’ said the Demosthenes with irony. ‘A landowner, a member of the gentry – and he doesn’t know what to do!

"Паншин ответил Марье Дмитриевне одним только взглядом, вежливо поклонился ей, но к ручке не подошел. Она представила его Варваре Павловне; он отступил на шаг, поклонился ей так же вежливо, но с оттенком изящества и уважения, и подсел к карточному столу. Преферанс скоро кончился. Паншин осведомился о Лизавете Михайловне, узнал, что она не совсем здорова, изъявил сожаленье; потом он заговорил с Варварой Павловной, дипломатически взвешивая и отчеканивая каждое слово, почтительно выслушивая ее ответы до конца. Но важность его дипломатического тона не действовала на Варвару Павловну, не сообщалась ей. Напротив: она с веселым вниманием глядела ему в лицо, говорила развязно, и тонкие ее ноздри слегка трепетали, как бы от сдержанного смеха. Марья Дмитриевна начала превозносить ее талант; Паншин учтиво, насколько позволяли ему воротнички, наклонил голову, объявил, что «он был в этом заранее уверен», – и завел речь чуть ли не о самом Меттернихе. Варвара Павловна прищурила свои бархатные глаза и, сказавши вполголоса: «Да ведь вы тоже артист, un confrere»[44], – прибавила еще тише: «Venez!»[45] – и качнула головой в сторону фортепьяно. Это одно брошенное слово: «Venez!» – мгновенно, как бы по волшебству, изменило всю наружность Паншина. Озабоченная осанка его исчезла; он улыбнулся, оживился, расстегнул фрак и, повторяя: «Какой я артист, увы! Вот вы, я слышал, артистка истинная», – направился вслед за Варварой Павловной к фортепьяно.","Panshin replied to Marya Dmitrievna with a single glance, bowed politely to her, but did not approach the pen. She introduced him to Varvara Pavlovna; he stepped back, bowed to her with the same politeness, but with a touch of grace and respect, and sat down at the card table. The preference soon ended. Panshin inquired about Lizaveta Mikhailovna, learned that she was not quite well, and expressed his regret; then he spoke to Varvara Pavlovna, diplomatically weighing and minting every word, respectfully listening to her answers to the end. But the importance of his diplomatic tone did not affect Varvara Pavlovna, was not communicated to her. On the contrary: she gazed into his face with merry attention, spoke casually, and her thin nostrils quivered slightly, as if from restrained laughter. Marya Dmitrievna began to extol her talent; Panshin politely, as far as his collars would allow him, bowed his head, announced that ""he was sure of it in advance,"" and started talking almost about Metternich himself. Varvara Pavlovna screwed up her velvety eyes and, saying in an undertone: “But you are also an artist, un confrere,”[44] she added even more quietly: “Venez!”[45]—and shook her head in the direction of the pianoforte. It's one thrown word: ""Venez!"" - instantly, as if by magic, changed the whole appearance of Panshin. His preoccupied bearing vanished; he smiled, perked up, unbuttoned his coat and, repeating: “What an artist I am, alas! Here you are, I heard, a true artist, ”he followed Varvara Pavlovna to the piano.","Panshin answered Marya Dmitrievna with no more than a glance, bowed politely to her, but did not kiss her hand. She introduced him to Varvara Pavlovna; he stepped back a pace, bowed to her just as politely, but with a suggestion of elegance and respect, and sat down at the card table. The game soon ended. Panshin asked about Lizaveta Mikhaylovna, learned that she was not quite well and expressed his regret; then he struck up a conversation with Varvara Pavlovna, diplomatically weighing and neatly rounding each word and respectfully hearing out her answers to the end. But the self-importance of his diplomatic tone did not have any effect on Varvara Pavlovna and was not even communicated to her. On the contrary, she looked him in the face with gay attentiveness, speaking without constraint, and her delicate nostrils quivered slightly as if from suppressed laughter. Marya Dmitrievna began to praise her talents; Panshin courteously bowed his head (as much as his collar would permit him), declared that ‘he had been sure of that from the start’ – and embarked on a discourse that led him almost to Metternich1. Varvara Pavlovna screwed up her velvety eyes and, saying in a low voice: ‘Yes, you’re an artist, too, un confrère,’ added even more quietly: ‘Venez!’ and nodded in the direction of the piano. This one casual word: ‘Venez!’ instantly, as if by magic, changed Panshin’s whole appearance. His preoccupied expression vanished; he smiled, grew animated, undid his coat and, repeating: ‘What sort of an artist am I, indeed? But you, I hear, are a true artist,’ followed Varvara Pavlovna to the piano.","Panshin only replied to Marya Dmitrievna by a single glance. He bowed courteously to her, but did not kiss her hand. She presented him to Varvara Pavlovna; he stepped back a pace, bowed to her with the same courtesy, but with still greater elegance and respect, and took a seat near the card-table. The game of preference was soon over. Panshin inquired after Lisaveta Mihalovna, learnt that she was not quite well, and expressed his regret. Then he began to talk to Varvara Pavlovna, diplomatically weighing each word and giving it its full value, and politely hearing her answers to the end. But the dignity of his diplomatic tone did not impress Varvara Pavlovna, and she did not adopt it. On the contrary, she looked him in the face with light-hearted attention and talked easily, while her delicate nostrils were quivering as though with suppressed laughter. Marya Dmitrievna began to enlarge on her talent; Panshin courteously inclined his head, so far as his collar would permit him, declared that, “he felt sure of it beforehand,” and almost turned the conversation to the diplomatic topic of Metternich himself. Varvara Pavlovna, with an expressive look in her velvety eyes, said in a low voice, “Why, but you too are an artist, un confrere,” adding still lower, “venez!” with a nod towards the piano. The single word venez thrown at him, instantly, as though by magic, effected a complete transformation in Panshin’s whole appearance. His care-worn air disappeared; he smiled and grew lively, unbuttoned his coat, and repeating “a poor artist, alas! Now you, I have heard, are a real artist; he followed Varvara Pavlovna to the piano...."
"– Какой странный вопрос! – воскликнула она, вытащила удочку и далеко закинула ее снова.","What a strange question! - she exclaimed, pulled out a fishing rod and threw it far again.","‘What a strange question!’ she exclaimed, drawing the line out of the water and casting it again.","“What a queer question!” she exclaimed, drawing up her line and throwing it in again further off."
"Лаврецкий невольно поднялся со стула; Марья Дмитриевна тоже встала и, проворно зайдя за ширмы, вывела оттуда Варвару Павловну. Бледная, полуживая, с опущенными глазами, она, казалось, отреклась от воякой собственной мысли, от всякой воли – отдалась вся в руки Марьи Дмитриевны. Лаврецкий отступил шаг назад.","Lavretsky involuntarily got up from his chair; Marya Dmitrievna also got up and, deftly going behind the screen, brought Varvara Pavlovna out of there. Pale, half-dead, with lowered eyes, she seemed to have renounced her own militant thoughts, all will - she gave herself entirely into the hands of Marya Dmitrievna. Lavretsky took a step back.","Lavretsky involuntarily rose from his chair; Marya Dmitrievna also stood up and, going briskly behind a screen, led Varvara Pavlovna out from behind it. Pale, half-alive, with lowered eyes, she seemed to have abdicated all thoughts of her own, all will-power – and to have given herself over wholly into Marya Dmitrievna’s hands. Lavretsky took a step back.","Involuntarily Lavretsky jumped up from his chair; Marya Dmitrievna also rose and running quickly behind a screen, she led forth Varvara Pavlovna. Pale, almost lifeless, with downcast eyes, she seemed to have renounced all thought, all will of her own, and to have surrendered herself completely to Marya Dmitrievna. Lavretsky stepped back a pace."
"– Я, брат, – промолвил он, – завтра должен ехать; сегодня мы, уж ты извини меня, ляжем поздно. Мне хочется непременно узнать, что ты, какие твои мнения, убежденья, чем ты стал, чему жизнь тебя научила? (Михалевич придерживался еще фразеологии тридцатых годов.) Что касается до меня, я во многом изменился, брат: волны жизни упали на мою грудь, – кто, бишь, это сказал? – хотя в важном, существенном я не изменился; я по-прежнему верю в добро, в истину; но я не только верю, – я верую теперь, да – я верую, верую. Послушай, ты знаешь, я пописываю стихи; в них поэзии нет, но есть правда. Я тебе прочту мою последнюю пиесу: в ней я выразил самые задушевные мои убеждения. Слушай.","“I, brother,” he said, “must go tomorrow; today we, excuse me, we will go to bed late. I want to know without fail what you are, what are your opinions, beliefs, what have you become, what has life taught you? (Mikhalevich still adhered to the phraseology of the thirties.) As for me, I have changed in many ways, brother: the waves of life fell on my chest - who, I mean, said that? - although in important, essential I have not changed; I still believe in good, in truth; but I not only believe—I believe now, yes—I believe, I believe. Look, you know I write poetry; there is no poetry in them, but there is truth. I will read you my last play: in it I expressed my most sincere convictions. Listen.","‘My dear fellow,’ he said, ‘I must be off tomorrow; today – you must forgive me – we will go to bed late. I simply must know what you’ve been up to, what your opinions and convictions are, what you’ve become, what life has taught you.’ (Mikhalevich adhered to the phraseology of the thirties.) ‘So far as I’m concerned, I’ve changed a great deal, my dear chap. The waves of life have broken o’er my breast – by the way, who said that? – although in all the important and essential things I have not changed; I believe as ever in goodness and truth; but I not only believe in them, I now have faith – yes, I have faith in them , I have faith in them. Listen a moment – you know I scribble verses; there’s no poetry in them, but there is truth. I’ll read you my latest piece: in it I’ve expressed my most heartfelt convictions. Listen.’","“I must set off to-morrow, my dear fellow,” he observed; “to-day if you will excuse it, we will sit up late. I want above all to know what you are like, what are your views and convictions, what you have become, what life has taught you.” (Mihalevitch still preserved the phraseology of 1830.) “As for me, I have changed in much; the waves of life have broken over my breast—who was it said that?—though in what is important, essential I have not changed; I believe as of old in the good, the true: but I do not only believe—I have faith now, yes, I have faith, faith. Listen, you know I write verses; there is no poetry in them, but there is truth. I will read you aloud my last poem; I have expressed my truest convictions in it. Listen.”"
"– Именно цынык, – повторил, не смущаясь, Михалевич.","“Just tsynyk,” Mikhalevich repeated without embarrassment.","‘Precisely, seeneek,’ repeated Mikhalevich unperturbed.","“Ceeneec, just so,” repeated Mihalevitch unabashed."
"– Точно так-с, – возразил лакей и осклабился. Лаврецкий пожал плечами и отправился вслед за ним.","“Just so, sir,” objected the lackey, and grinned. Lavretsky shrugged his shoulders and followed him.","‘Yes-sir,’ the footman replied and grinned. Lavretsky shrugged his shoulders and followed him.","“Certainly, sir,” replied the servant with a grin. Lavretsky shrugged his shoulders and followed him."
"– Ах, не говорите таких ужасных слов, – перебила его Варвара Павловна, – пощадите меня, хотя… хотя ради этого ангела… – И, сказавши эти слова, Варвара Павловна стремительно выбежала в другую комнату и тотчас же вернулась с маленькой, очень изящно одетой девочкой на руках. Крупные русые кудри падали ей на хорошенькое румяное личико, на большие черные заспанные глаза; она и улыбалась, и щурилась от огня, и упиралась пухлой ручонкой в шею матери.","“Oh, don’t say such terrible words,” Varvara Pavlovna interrupted him, “have mercy on me, although ... although for the sake of this angel ...” And, having said these words, Varvara Pavlovna quickly ran out into another room and immediately returned with a small, very elegantly dressed girl in her arms. Large blond curls fell on her pretty ruddy face, on big black sleepy eyes; she smiled and squinted from the fire, and rested her plump little hand on her mother's neck.","‘Ah, don’t say such terrible things,’ Varvara Pavlovna interrupted him. ‘ Have pity on me, if only for… if only for the sake of this angel…’ And, so saying, Varvara Pavlovna dashed headlong into the other room and instantly returned with a small, very elegantly dressed little girl in her arms. Large auburn curls fell about her pretty, rosy little face and on her large, black, sleepy eyes; she was both smiling and screwing up her eyes from the firelight and leaning with one fat little hand on her mother’s neck.","“Ah, don’t say such dreadful things,” Varvara Pavlovna interrupted him, “spare me, if only... if only for the sake of this angel.” And as she uttered these words, Varvara Pavlovna ran impulsively into the next room, and returned at once with a small and very elegantly dressed little girl in her arms. Thick flaxen curls fell over her pretty rosy little face, and on to her large sleepy black eyes; she smiled and blinked her eyes at the light and laid a chubby little hand on her mother’s neck."
"– Ты все говоришь: ничего. Что у вас там внизу, опять музыка?","“You keep saying nothing. What do you have down there, music again?",‘You always say it’s nothing. What’s happening downstairs – is it music again?’,“You keep saying it’s nothing. What have you going on down-stairs—music?”

"Лаврецкий не был молодым человеком; он не мог долго обманываться насчет чувства, внушенного ему Лизой; он окончательно в тот же день убедился в том, что полюбил ее. Не много радости принесло ему это убеждение. «Неужели, – подумал он, – мне в тридцать пять лет нечего другого делать, как опять отдать свою душу в руки женщины? Но Лиза не чета той: она бы не потребовала от меня постыдных жертв; она не отвлекла бы меня от моих занятий; она бы сама воодушевила меня на честный, строгий труд, и мы пошли бы оба вперед к прекрасной цели. Да, – кончил он свои размышления, – все это хорошо, но худо то, что она вовсе не захочет пойти со мной. Недаром она сказала мне, что я ей страшен. Зато и Паншина она не любит… Слабое утешение!»","Lavretsky was not a young man; he could not deceive himself for a long time about the feeling Lisa inspired in him; he finally on the same day was convinced that he loved her. Not much joy brought him this conviction. “Is it possible,” he thought, “at thirty-five years of age I have nothing else to do but to again give my soul into the hands of a woman? But Liza is not like that: she would not demand shameful sacrifices from me; she would not distract me from my studies; she herself would inspire me to honest, rigorous work, and we would both go forward towards a wonderful goal. Yes,” he finished his reflections, “that’s all good, but the bad thing is that she doesn’t want to go with me at all. No wonder she told me that she was afraid of me. But she doesn’t like Panshin either ... Small consolation!","LAVRETSKY was not a young man; he could not deceive himself for long about the feeling induced in him by Liza; that day he was finally convinced he loved her. This conviction brought him no great happiness. ‘Can it be’, he thought, ‘that at thirty-five years of age I have nothing better to do than once again relinquish my soul to a woman? But Liza is not to be compared with her: she would not demand degrading sacrifices; she would not distract me from my studies; she would herself inspire me to honest, disciplined labour, and we would go forward together towards a beautiful ideal. Yes,’ he ended his reflections, ‘all this is good, but the bad part is that she has no wish to go with me. She meant it when she said I terrified her. Still she doesn’t love Panshin… a poor consolation!’","Lavretsky was not a young man; he could not long delude himself as to the nature of the feeling inspired in him by Lisa; he was brought on that day to the final conviction that he loved her. This conviction did not give him ay great pleasure. “Have I really nothing better to do,” he thought, “at thirty-five than to put my soul into a woman’s keeping again? But Lisa is not like her; she would not demand degrading sacrifices from me: she would not tempt me away from my duties; she would herself incite me to hard honest work, and we would walk hand in hand towards a noble aim. Yes,” he concluded his reflections, “that’s all very fine, but the worst of it is that she does not in the least wish to walk hand in hand with me. She meant it when she said that I frightened her. But she doesn’t love Panshin either—a poor consolation!”"

"Звезды уже начинали бледнеть и небо серело, когда коляска подъехала к крыльцу домика в Васильевском. Лаврецкий проводил своего гостя в назначенную ему комнату, вернулся в кабинет и сел перед окном. В саду пел соловей свою последнюю, передрассветную песнь. Лаврецкий вспомнил, что и у Калитиных в саду пел соловей; он вспомнил также тихое движение Лизиных глаз, когда, при первых его звуках, они обратились к темному окну. Он стал думать о ней, и сердце в нем утихло. «Чистая девушка, – проговорил он вполголоса, – чистые звезды», – прибавил он с улыбкой и спокойно лег спать.","The stars were already beginning to fade and the sky was turning gray when the carriage drove up to the porch of the house in Vasilyevsky. Lavretsky escorted his guest to the room assigned to him, returned to the study and sat down in front of the window. In the garden the nightingale sang its last, pre-dawn song. Lavretsky remembered that a nightingale sang in the Kalitins' garden too; he also remembered the quiet movement of Liza's eyes when, at the first sound of it, they turned to the dark window. He began to think of her, and his heart subsided. ""A pure girl,"" he said in an undertone, ""clean stars,"" he added with a smile, and calmly went to bed.","The stars were already beginning to pale and the sky had grown grey by the time the carriage drove up to the porch of the little house in Vasilyevskoye.

Lavretsky remembered that a nightingale had sung in the Kalitins’ garden; he remembered also the quiet movement of Liza’s eyes when, at the first sounds of the nightingale’s song, they had turned towards the dark window.

"Лаврецкий вошел в комнату и опустился на стул; старик остановился перед ним, запахнув полы своего пестрого, дряхлого халата, ежась и жуя губами.","Lavretsky entered the room and sank into a chair; the old man stopped in front of him, wrapping up the hems of his motley, decrepit robe, shivering and chewing his lips.","Lavretsky entered the room and sank down on to a chair; the old man stopped in front of him and drew the skirts of his threadbare, colourful dressing-gown round him, hugging himself and gnawing his lips.","Lavretsky went into the room and sank into a chair.

"Лаврецкий тихо встал и тихо удалился; его никто не заметил, никто не удерживал; веселые клики сильнее прежнего раздавались в саду за зеленой сплошной стеной высоких лип. Он сел в тарантас и велел кучеру ехать домой и не гнать лошадей.","Lavretsky quietly got up and quietly withdrew; no one noticed him, no one held him back; merry cries resounded louder than ever in the garden behind a solid green wall of tall lindens. He got into the carriage and ordered the coachman to go home and not to drive the horses.","Lavretsky rose quietly and quietly departed; nobody noticed him, nobody detained him; the gay shouts rang out still more loudly in the garden beyond the tall green screen of limes.

"– О дитя мое! – воскликнул вдруг Лаврецкий, и голос его задрожал, – не мудрствуйте лукаво, не называйте слабостью крик вашего сердца, которое не хочет отдаться без любви. Не берите на себя такой страшной ответственности перед тем человеком, которого вы не любите и которому хотите принадлежать…","- Oh, my child! Lavretsky suddenly exclaimed, and his voice trembled.

"С наступившими первыми холодами Варвара Павловна, несмотря на свое обещание зарыться в глуши, запасшись денежками, переселилась в Петербург, где наняла скромную, но миленькую квартиру, отысканную для нее Паншиным, который еще раньше ее покинул О…скую губернию. В последнее время своего пребывания в О… он совершенно лишился расположения Марьи Дмитриевны; он вдруг перестал ее посещать и почти не выезжал из Лавриков.

Только ты, смотри, зайди проститься. – Старушка потрепала его по щеке. – Не думала я дождаться тебя; и не то чтоб я умирать собиралась; нет – меня еще годов на десять, пожалуй, хватит: все мы, Пестовы, живучи; дед твой покойный, бывало, двужильными нас прозывал; да ведь господь тебя знал, сколько б ты еще за границей проболтался. Ну, а молодец ты, молодец; чай, по-прежнему десять пудов одной рукой поднимаешь? Твой батюшка покойный, извини, уж на что был вздорный, а хорошо сделал, что швейцарца тебе нанял; помнишь, вы с ним на кулачки бились; гимнастикой, что ли, это прозывается? Но, однако, что это я так раскудахталась; только господину Паншину (она никогда не называла его, как следовало, Паншиным) рассуждать помешала. А впрочем, станемте-ка лучше чай пить; да на террасу пойдемте его, батюшку, пить; у нас сливки славные – не то что в ваших Лондонах да Парижах. Пойдемте, пойдемте, а ты, Федюша, дай мне руку. О! да какая же она у тебя толстая! Небось с тобой не упадешь.","- Well, if tomorrow, then tomorrow. God bless, you know better. Just you, look, come and say goodbye. The old woman patted him on the cheek. - I did not think to wait for you; and not that I was going to die; no - I'll probably have enough for another ten years: all of us, the Pestovs, are tenacious; your late grandfather used to call us two-stranded; but the Lord knew you, how much more you would have blabbed abroad. Well, well done you, well done; tea, do you still raise ten pounds with one hand? Your father is dead, excuse me, he was so absurd, but he did well that he hired you a Swiss; remember, you fought with him on fists; gymnastics, is it called? But, however, that it was I who cackled so; only Mr. Panshin (she never properly called him Panshin) was hindered from reasoning. And yet, let us better drink tea; yes, let’s go to the terrace, father, to drink it; we have nice cream - not like in your Londons and Parises. Let's go, let's go, and you, Fedyusha, give me your hand. O! Yes, she is so fat! Don't fall with you.","‘Very well, if it’s to be tomorrow, tomorrow it is. God be with you – you know best.

And that doesn’t mean I was getting ready to die – oh, no, I’ve got a good ten years to go yet: all we Pestovs are long-livers; your late grandfather used to call us double-lifers. But God alone knew how long you’d go on wasting your time abroad. Well, anyhow, you’re looking fine, really fine. I suppose you can still lift ten stone with one hand as you used to? Your late father, foolish though he was – you must forgive me for saying so – did well to engage that Swiss for you. Do you remember how you used to have fist fights with him? It’s called gymnastics, isn’t it? But I mustn’t go on chattering so; all I’m doing is preventing Mr Panshín’ (she never called him Pánshin, as she should have done) ‘from continuing what he was saying. Besides, it would be better if we had some tea. Let’s go out on the terrace to have it, my dear. We have wonderful cream, not the sort of stuff in your Londons and Parises.

Only mind you come and say good-bye to me.” The old woman patted his cheek. “I did not think I should be here to see you; not that I have made up my mind to die yet a while—I shall last another ten years, I daresay: all we Pestovs live long; your late grandfather used to say we had two lives; but you see there was no telling how much longer you were going to dangle about abroad. Well, you’re a fine lad, a fine lad; can you lift twenty stone with one hand as you used to do, eh? Your late pap was fantastical in some things, if I may say so; but he did well in having that Swiss to bring you up; do you remember you used to fight with your fists with him?—gymnastics, wasn’t it they called it? But there, why I am gabbling away like this; I have only been hindering Mr. PanSHIN (she never pronounced his name PANshin as was correct) from holding forth. Besides, we’d better go and have tea; yes, let’s go on to the terrace, my boy, and drink it there; we have some real cream, not like what you get in your Londons and Parises.

It’s awful ,’ she said, suddenly throwing down her cap and seating herself on Liza’s bed, ‘it’s more than I can bear – today is the fourth day that I’ve been literally bubbling with worry; I can’t go on pretending that I don’t notice anything, that I can’t see how pale you are, how dried up you are, how much you’re crying – I can’t, I can’t.’","“What word, eh?” the old lady returned quickly. “What do you mean? This is horrible,” she began, suddenly flinging off her cap and sitting down on Lisa’s little bed; “it is more than I can bear! this is the fourth day now that I have been boiling over inside; I can’t pretend not to notice any longer; I can’t see you getting pale, and fading away, and weeping , I can’t I can’t!”"

This disgust, she thought, is over! I'm not even a woman to him.""","Varvara Pavlovna pursed her lips and narrowed her eyes. ‘ This is repugnance,’ she thought. ‘It’s all over! I’m not even a woman for him.’","Varvara Pavlovna bit her lips and half-closed her eyes. “It is aversion,” she thought; “all is over; in his eyes I am not even a woman.”"
"– Да, Федя, очень. Больше нас с тобою, Федя.","- Yes, Fedya, very much. More of us with you, Fedya.","‘Yes, Fedya, she’s very religious. More than you and I are.’","“Yes, Fedya, very much so. More than you and I, Fedya.”"
"Она опять вздрогнула, как будто ее что-то ужалило, и подняла взоры к небу.","She shuddered again, as if something had stung her, and raised her eyes to the sky.","Again she shuddered, as though the words had stung her, and raised her eyes to the sky.","She shuddered again, as though something had stung her, and lifted her eyes towards heaven."
"– Ничего, мы прорепетируем вполголоса. Пустите меня.","- Nothing, we will rehearse in an undertone. Let me go.",We’ll rehearse it in a low voice. Allow me.’,"“Never mind, we will rehearse it in a low voice. Allow me.”"
"– А мы без вас принялись было за бетговенскую сонату, – продолжал Паншин, любезно взяв его за талию и светло улыбаясь, – но дело совсем на лад не пошло. Вообразите, я не мог две ноты сряду взять верно.","“And without you we set to work on the Beethoven sonata,” continued Panshin, kindly taking him by the waist and smiling brightly, “but things did not go smoothly at all. Imagine, I could not take two notes in a row correctly.","‘In your absence we tried the Beethoven Sonata,’ Panshin went on, amiably taking him by the waist and smiling brightly, ‘but the whole thing was hopeless. Just imagine it, I couldn’t play two notes in a row correctly.’","“We set to work on the sonata of Beethoven without you,” continued Panshin, taking hold of him affectionately and smiling brightly, “but we couldn’t get on at all. Fancy, I couldn’t play two notes together correctly.”"
"– Не спрашивайте меня ни о чем, – произнесла она с живостью, – я ничего не знаю; я сама себя не знаю… И она тотчас же удалилась.","“Don't ask me anything,” she said briskly, “I don't know anything; I don't know myself... And she immediately left.","‘Don’t ask me about anything!’ she cried with animation. ‘I don’t know anything, I don’t even know myself…’ And she at once left the room.",“Don’t ask me about anything!” she broke out hotly. “I know nothing; I don’t know myself.” And instantly she was gone.
"– Eh bien, madame?[31] – спросила ее ее служанка француженка, вывезенная ею из Парижа, снимая с нее корсет.","- Eh bien, madame?

Вам это будет приятно? Лемм наклонил голову над тарелкой.","“What do you think, Christopher Fyodoritch,” he said at last, “because everything seems to be in order now, the garden is in full bloom ... Why not invite her here for a day with her mother and my old aunt, huh? Will it please you?

– Оттого-то я и просил вас не говорить об этом никому. Лиза прошлась немного.,“That's why I asked you not to tell anyone about this. Lisa walked a little.,‘That’s why I asked you not to speak to anyone about it.’ Liza walked on a little way.,“That is why I asked you not to speak of it to any one.” Lisa walked on a little.

"Молодые люди выслушали Лаврецкого с приветливой и чуть-чуть насмешливой почтительностью, – точно им учитель урок прочел, – и вдруг посыпали от него все прочь, вбежали на поляну; четверо стало около деревьев, один на середине – и началась потеха.","The young people listened to Lavretsky with affable and slightly mocking reverence, as if a teacher had read a lesson to them, and suddenly they scattered everything away from him, ran into the clearing; four stood near the trees, one in the middle - and the fun began.","The young people listened to Lavretsky with affable and slightly ironic respectfulness, as if a teacher had just read them a lesson, and suddenly scattered, dashing on to the grass; four of them took up places by the trees, one in the middle – and the fun began.","The young people listened to Lavretsky with polite but rather ironical respect—as though a teacher were giving them a lesson—and suddenly they all dispersed, and ran to the lawn; four stood near trees, one in the middle, and the game began."

"– Приходите, – отвечала она с тем же недоумением на лице.","“Come,” she answered with the same bewilderment on her face.","‘Please come,’ she answered with the same perplexed look on her face.","“Come,” she answered with the same perplexity on her face."
– Приехала. Она теперь у меня; а я… я несчастный человек. И он опять усмехнулся.,– Has arrived. I have her now; and I ... I am an unfortunate person. And he smiled again.,‘Yes. She’s at my place now; and I’m… I’m an unlucky man.’ And again he gave a short laugh.,“Yes. She is at my house now; and I... I am an unlucky fellow.” And he laughed again.
"– Я понимаю ваше положение, – сказала она ему, – и он, по выражению ее умных глаз, мог заключить, что она понимала его положение вполне, – но вы отдадите мне хоть ту справедливость, что со мной легко живется; я не стану вам навязываться, стеснять вас; я хотела обеспечить будущность Ады; больше мне ничего не нужно.","“I understand your position,” she said to him, “and from the expression of her intelligent eyes, he could conclude that she fully understood his position, but you will give me at least that justice that life is easy with me; I will not impose on you, embarrass you; I wanted to secure Ada's future; I don't need anything more.","‘I understand your position,’ she told him – and, judging by the expression of her clever eyes, he could conclude that she understood his position fully. ‘But you must at least do me the justice of agreeing that I am easy to live with; I won’t impose myself on you or embarrass you; I wanted to ensure Ada’s future; I need nothing more.’","“I understand your position,” she said to him, and from the look in her subtle eyes, he was able to infer that she understood his position fully, “but you must do me , at least, this justice, that I am easy to live with; I will not fetter you or hinder you; I wanted to secure Ada’s future, I want nothing more.”"

"Он начал облачаться; дьячок в стихаре подобострастно попросил уголька; запахло ладаном. Из передней вышли горничные и лакеи и остановились сплошной кучкой перед дверями. Роска, никогда не сходившая сверху, вдруг появилась в столовой: ее стали выгонять – она испугалась, завертелась и села; лакей подхватил ее и унес. Всенощная началась. Лаврецкий прижался в уголок; ощущения его были странны, почти грустны; он сам не мог хорошенько разобрать, что он чувствовал. Марья Дмитриевна стояла впереди всех, перед креслами; она крестилась изнеженно-небрежно, по-барски – то оглядывалась, то вдруг поднимала взоры кверху: она скучала. Марфа Тимофеевна казалась озабоченной; Настасья Карповна клала земные поклоны и вставала с каким-то скромным и мягким шумом; Лиза, как стала, так и не двигалась с места и не шевелилась; по сосредоточенному выражению ее лица можно было догадаться, что она пристально и горячо молилась. Прикладываясь ко кресту по окончании всенощной, она также поцеловала большую красную руку священника. Марья Дмитриевна пригласила его откушать чаю; он снял епитрахиль, принял несколько светский вид и вместе с дамами перешел в гостиную. Начался разговор, не слишком оживленный. Священник выпил четыре чашки, беспрестанно отирая платком свою лысину, рассказал, между прочим, что купец Авошников пожертвовал семьсот рублей на позолоту церковного «кумпола», и сообщил верное средство против веснушек. Лаврецкий подсел было к Лизе, но она держалась строго, почти сурово, и ни разу не взглянула на него. Она как будто с намерением его не замечала; какая-то холодная, важная восторженность нашла на нее. Лаврецкому почему-то все хотелось улыбнуться и сказать что-нибудь забавное; но на сердце у него было смущение, и он ушел наконец, тайно недоумевая… Он чувствовал: что-то было в Лизе, куда он проникнуть не мог.","He began to dress; the deacon in surplice obsequiously asked for a piece of coal; smelled of incense. The maids and footmen came out of the hall and stood in a solid group in front of the doors. Roska, who had never descended from above, suddenly appeared in the dining room: they began to drive her out - she was frightened, turned around and sat down; the footman picked it up and carried it away. Vespers began. Lavretsky pressed himself into a corner; his sensations were strange, almost sad; he himself could not quite make out what he felt. Marya Dmitrievna stood in front of everyone, in front of the armchairs; she crossed herself pampered, carelessly, in a lordly way - now looking around, then suddenly raising her eyes upwards: she was bored. Marfa Timofeevna seemed preoccupied; Nastasya Karpovna bowed to the ground and got up with some kind of modest and soft noise; Liza, as she became, did not move from her place and did not stir; one could guess from the concentrated expression of her face that she was intently and fervently praying. As she venerated the cross at the end of the vigil, she also kissed the priest's big red hand. Marya Dmitrievna invited him to have tea; he took off his epitrachelion, assumed a somewhat secular air, and, together with the ladies, went into the drawing-room. A conversation began, not too lively. The priest drank four cups, constantly wiping his bald head with a handkerchief, and said, among other things, that the merchant Avoshnikov had donated seven hundred rubles for the gilding of the church kumpol, and he had given the right remedy for freckles. Lavretsky sat down next to Lisa, but she behaved sternly, almost sternly, and never once looked at him. She seemed to deliberately ignore him; some kind of cold, solemn enthusiasm came over her. For some reason Lavretsky kept on wanting to smile and say something amusing; but he had confusion in his heart, and he left at last, secretly perplexed... He felt that there was something in Lisa that he could not penetrate.","He began to put on his vestments; a deacon in a surplice asked obsequiously for a live coal; the smell of incense arose. Household servants came in from the hall and stood in a dense crowd by the doors. Roska, who had never come downstairs before, suddenly appeared in the dining-room: they started to drive her out, but she grew frightened, dashed round and round and then sat down; a manservant picked her up and carried her away. The service began. Lavretsky pressed himself into a corner; his feelings were strange, almost sad; he had no very clear idea what he felt. Marya Dmitrievna stood at the front, before the armchairs; she made the sign of the cross with an affected nonchalance, in lordly fashion, either looking around her or suddenly raising her eyes to the ceiling: she was manifestly bored. Marfa Timofeyevna seemed preoccupied; Nastasya Karpovna bowed to the floor and rose again with a kind of soft and modest rustling; Liza stood on the one spot without moving or stirring; judging from the look of concentration on her face, it could be assumed that she was engaged in intent and fervent prayer. When the cross was placed to her lips at the end of the service, she also kissed the priest’s large red hand. Marya Dmitrievna invited him to take tea; he removed his stole, took on a slightly worldly look and joined the ladies in the drawing-room. A not unduly lively conversation began. The priest drank four cups of tea, ceaselessly wiped his bald patch with a handkerchief, related among other things that the merchant Avoshnikov had given seven hundred roubles for the gilding of the church ‘cupola’ and informed them of a reliable means of getting rid of freckles. Lavretsky was about to sit next to Liza, but she held herself stiffly, almost severely, and did not once glance in his direction. She seemed deliberately not to notice him; she was possessed by a kind of cold, serious exaltation. Lavretsky for some reason felt a constant urge to smile and say amusing things; but there was confusion in his heart, and he left finally, secretly bewildered…. He felt that there was something in Liza which he could not fathom.","He began to put on his robes; a deacon in a surplice asked obsequiously for a hot ember; there was a scent of incense. The maids and men-servants came out from the hall and remained huddled close together before the door. Roska, who never came down from up-stairs, suddenly ran into the dining-room; they began to chase her out; she was scared, doubled back into the room and sat down; a footman picked her up and carried her away. The evening service began. Lavretsky squeezed himself into a corner; his emotions were strange, almost sad; he could not himself make out clearly what he was feeling. Marya Dmitrievna stood in front of all, before the chairs; she crossed herself with languid carelessness, like a grand lady, and first looked about her, then suddenly lifted her eyes to the ceiling; she was bored. Marfa Timofyevna looked worried; Nastasya Karpovna bowed down to the ground and got up with a kind of discreet, subdued rustle; Lisa remained standing in her place motionless; from the concentrated expression of her face it could be seen that she was praying steadfastly and fervently. When she bowed to the cross at the end of the service, she also kissed the large red hand of the priest. Marya Dmitrievna invited the latter to have some tea; he took off his vestment, assumed a somewhat more worldly air, and passed into the drawing-room with the ladies.

He felt there was something in Lisa to which he could never penetrate."
– Вы отказали ему? – перебил Лаврецкий.,- Did you refuse him? interrupted Lavretsky.,‘You refused him?’ Lavretsky interrupted.,“You have refused him?” interrupted Lavretsky.

"Шурочка фыркнула подавленным смехом и выскочила вон, а Лаврецкий поднялся с своего места.","Shurochka snorted with suppressed laughter and rushed out, while Lavretsky got up from his seat.",Shurochka gave a snort of suppressed laughter and skipped out of the room just as Lavretsky rose from his place.,Shurotchka choked with suppressed laughter and skipped out of the room.

"Лаврецкий вышел из дома в сад, сел на знакомой ему скамейке – и на этом дорогом месте, перед лицом того дома, где он в последний раз напрасно простирал свои руки к заветному кубку, в котором кипит и играет золотое вино наслажденья, – он, одинокий, бездомный странник, под долетавшие до него веселые клики уже заменившего его молодого поколения, оглянулся на свою жизнь. Грустно стало ему на сердце, но не тяжело и не прискорбно: сожалеть ему было о чем, стыдиться нечего. «Играйте, веселитесь, растите, молодые силы, – думал он, и не было горечи в его думах, – жизнь у вас впереди, и вам легче будет жить: вам не придется, как нам, отыскивать свою дорогу, бороться, падать и вставать среди мрака; мы хлопотали о том, как бы уцелеть – и сколько из нас не уцелело! – а вам надобно дело делать, работать, и благословение нашего брата, старика, будет с вами. А мне, после сегодняшнего дня, после этих ощущений, остается отдать вам последний поклон – и, хотя с печалью, но без зависти, безо всяких темных чувств, сказать, в виду конца, в виду ожидающего бога: „Здравствуй, одинокая старость! Догорай, бесполезная жизнь!“","Lavretsky went out of the house into the garden, sat down on a bench familiar to him - and on this dear place, in front of that house where for the last time he vainly stretched out his hands to the cherished goblet in which the golden wine of pleasure boils and plays - he, lonely , a homeless wanderer, under the cheerful cries of the younger generation that had already replaced him, reached him, looked back at his life. His heart felt sad, but not heavy and not regrettable: he had something to regret, nothing to be ashamed of. “Play, have fun, grow up, young forces,” he thought, and there was no bitterness in his thoughts, “you have your life ahead of you, and it will be easier for you to live: you don’t have to, like us, find your way, fight, fall and get up in the midst of darkness; we fussed about how to survive - and how many of us did not survive! - and you need to do business, work, and the blessing of our brother, the old man, will be with you. And after today, after these sensations, it remains for me to give you my last bow - and, although with sadness, but without envy, without any dark feelings, say, in view of the end, in view of the awaiting God: “Hello, lonely old age! Burn down, useless life!“","Lavretsky went out of the house into the garden, sat down on the bench that was so familiar to him – and in that dear place, face to face with the house where for the last time he had vainly stretched out his hands to the promised cup in which there bubbles and sparkles the golden wine of pleasure – he, a lonely, homeless wanderer, his ears filled with the gay shouts of a younger generation that had already taken his place, looked back upon his life. He grew sad at heart, but not oppressed and not ashamed: there were things to regret, nothing to be ashamed of. ‘Play on, enjoy yourselves, grow up, forces of youth,’ he thought, and there was no bitterness in his thoughts. ‘Your life lies ahead of you, and for you it will be easier: you won’t have to seek out your path as we have done, to struggle and fall and rise again in the midst of darkness; we had to strive to remain whole – and how many of us fell by the wayside? – but for you there are things to be done, there is work to do, and the blessing of us old men will go with you. But for me, after this day, after such sensations as these, it remains only to make you a final bow – and, if with sadness, but without envy, without any dark feelings, to say, in sight of the end, in sight of an ever-waiting God: “Welcome, lonely old age! Burn out, useless life!”‘","Lavretsky went out of the house into the garden, and sat down on the familiar garden seat. And on this loved spot, facing the house where for the last time he had vainly stretched out his hand for the enchanted cup which frothed and sparkled with the golden wine of delight, he, a solitary homeless wanderer, looked back upon his life, while the joyous shouts of the younger generation who were already filling his place floated across the garden to him. His heart was sad, but not weighed down, nor bitter; much there was to regret, nothing to be ashamed of. “Play away, be gay, grow strong, vigorous youth!” he thought, and there was no bitterness in his meditations; “your life is before you, and for you life will be easier; you have not, as we had, to find out a path for yourselves, to struggle, to fall, and to rise again in the dark; we had enough to do to last out—and how many of us did not last out?—but you need only do your duty, work away, and the blessing of an old man be with you. For me, after to-day, after these emotions, there remains to take my leave at last,—and though sadly, without envy, without any dark feelings, to say, in sight of the end, in sight of God who awaits me: ‘Welcome, lonely old age! burn out, useless life!’”"
"Лаврецкий написал два слова Лизе: он известил ее о приезде жены, просил ее назначить ему свидание, – и бросился на узенький диван лицом к стене; а старик лег на постель и долго ворочался, кашляя и отпивая глотками свой декокт.","Lavretsky wrote two words to Liza: he informed her of his wife's arrival, asked her to make an appointment with him, and threw himself on the narrow sofa facing the wall; and the old man lay down on the bed and tossed and turned for a long time, coughing and drinking his decoction in sips.","Lavretsky wrote a couple of words to Liza: he informed her of his wife’s arrival and begged her to let him see her – and flung himself down on the narrow divan with his face to the wall; and the old man lay down on his bed and was restless for a long time, coughing and taking mouthfuls of his decoction.","Lavretsky wrote a few words to Lisa.

"Лаврецкому уже не удалось более побывать наедине с Лизой; но он так глядел на нее, что ей и хорошо становилось, и стыдно немножко, и жалко его. Прощаясь с ней, он крепко пожал ей руку; она задумалась, оставшись одна.","Lavretsky no longer managed to be alone with Liza; but he looked at her so that she felt good, and a little ashamed, and sorry for him.

"День пронесся быстро в этих размышлениях; настал вечер. Лаврецкий отправился к Калитиным. Он шел поспешно, но к дому их приблизился замедленными шагами. Перед крыльцом стояли дрожки Паншина. «Ну, – подумал Лаврецкий, – не буду эгоистом», и вошел в дом. В доме он никого не встретил, и в гостиной было тихо; он отворил дверь и увидел Марью Дмитриевну, игравшую в пикет с Паншиным. Паншин молча ему поклонился, а хозяйка дома воскликнула: «Вот неожиданно!» – и слегка нахмурила брови. Лаврецкий подсел к ней и стал глядеть ей в карты.","The day passed quickly in these reflections; evening has come. Lavretsky went to the Kalitins. He walked hastily, but approached their house with slow steps. Panshin's droshky stood in front of the porch. ""Well,"" thought Lavretsky, ""I won't be an egoist,"" and he entered the house. He met no one in the house, and the drawing-room was quiet; he opened the door and saw Marya Dmitrievna playing picket with Panshin. Panshin silently bowed to him, and the mistress of the house exclaimed: ""That's unexpected!"" and furrowed her brows slightly. Lavretsky sat down beside her and began looking at her cards.","The day passed quickly in these reflections, and it became evening. Lavretsky went to the Kalitins. He walked hurriedly, but he approached their house with slower steps. Panshin’s droshky stood before the porch. ‘ Well,’ thought Lavretsky, ‘I’m not going to be an egoist,’ and he went into the house. He met no one inside, and there was no sound from the drawing-room; he opened the door and saw Marya Dmitrievna playing picquet with Panshin. Panshin bowed to him without speaking, and the mistress of the house exclaimed: ‘What a surprise!’ and slightly knitted her brows. Lavretsky sat down beside her and began looking at her cards.","The day passed quickly by in these meditations; and evening came. Lavretsky went to the Kalitins’. He walked quickly, but his pace slackened as he drew near the house. Before the steps was standing Panshin’s light carriage. “Come,” though Lavretsky, “I will not be an egoist”—and he went into the house. He met with no one within-doors, and there was no sound in the drawing-room; he opened the door and saw Marya Dmitrievna playing picquet with Panshin. Panshin bowed to him without speaking, but the lady of the house cried, “Well, this is unexpected!” and slightly frowned. Lavretsky sat down near her, and began to look at her cards."
"Петр Андреич сдержал свое слово. Он известил сына, что для смертного часа его матери, для младенца Федора он возвращает ему свое благословение и Маланью Сергеевну оставляет у себя в доме. Ей отвели две комнаты в антресолях, он представил ее своим почтеннейшим гостям, кривому бригадиру Скурехииу и жене его; подарил ей двух девок и казачка для посылок. Марфа Тимофеевна с ней простилась: она возненавидела Глафиру и в течение одного дня раза три поссорилась с нею.","Pyotr Andreich kept his word. He informed his son that for the hour of death of his mother, for the baby Fyodor, he returns his blessing to him and leaves Malanya Sergeevna in his house. She was given two rooms in the mezzanine, he introduced her to his most respected guests, the crooked foreman Skurekhiiu and his wife; gave her two girls and a Cossack girl for parcels. Marfa Timofeevna took leave of her: she hated Glafira and in the course of one day quarreled with her three times.","Pyotr Andreyich kept his word. He informed his son that for the sake of his mother’s dying wish and for the sake of the infant Fyodor he was returning to him his blessing and allowing Malanya Sergeyevna to remain with him in his house. She was given two rooms in the attic, and he introduced her to his two most honoured guests, the one-eyed brigadier Skurekhin and his wife. He also gave her two maids and a boy to run her errands. Marfa Timofeyevna said good-bye to her: she could not stand the sight of Glafira and in the course of one day quarrelled with her three times.","Piotr Andreitch kept his word. He informed his son that for the sake of his mother’s dying hours, and for the sake of the little Fedor, he sent him his blessing and was keeping Malanya Sergyevna in his house.

"Агафья, однако, не ужилась с Марфой Тимофеевной, когда та переехала в калитинский дом. Строгая важность бывшей «паневницы» не нравилась нетерпеливой и самовольной старушке. Агафья отпросилась на богомолье и не вернулась. Ходили темные слухи, будто она удалилась в раскольничий скит. Но след, оставленный ею в душе Лизы, не изгладился. Она по-прежнему шла к обедне, как на праздник, молилась с наслажденьем, с каким-то сдержанным и стыдливым порывом, чему Марья Дмитриевна втайне немало дивилась, да и сама Марфа Тимофеевна, хотя ни в чем не стесняла Лизу, однако старалась умерить ее рвение и не позволяла ей класть лишние земные поклоны: не дворянская, мол, это замашка. Училась Лиза хорошо, то есть усидчиво; особенно блестящими способностями, большим умом ее бог не наградил; без труда ей ничего не давалось. Она хорошо играла на фортепьяно; но один Лемм знал, чего ей это стоило. Читала она немного; у ней не было «своих слов», но были свои мысли, и шла она своей дорогой. Недаром походила она на отца: он тоже не спрашивал у других, что ему делать. Так росла она – покойно, неторопливо, так достигла девятнадцатилетнего возраста. Она была очень мила, сама того не зная. В каждом ее движенье высказывалась невольная, несколько неловкая грация; голос ее звучал серебром нетронутой юности; малейшее ощущение удовольствия вызывало привлекательную улыбку на ее губы, придавало глубокий блеск и какую-то тайную ласковость ее засветившимся глазам. Вся проникнутая чувством долга, боязнью оскорбить кого бы то ни было, с сердцем добрым и кротким, она любила всех и никого в особенности; она любила одного бога восторженно, робко, нежно. Лаврецкий первый нарушил ее тихую внутреннюю жизнь. Такова была Лиза.","Agafya, however, did not get along with Marfa Timofeevna when she moved into the Kalitinsky house. The strict importance of the former ""panevnitsa"" did not please the impatient and self-willed old woman. Agafya asked to go on a pilgrimage and did not return. There were dark rumors that she had retired to a schismatic skete. But the trace left by her in Liza's soul has not been erased. As before, she went to mass, as if on a holiday, praying with pleasure, with some restrained and bashful impulse, at which Marya Dmitrievna secretly marveled a lot, and Marfa Timofeevna herself, although she did not embarrass Liza in anything, nevertheless tried to moderate her. zeal and did not allow her to make unnecessary prostrations: not noble, they say, this is a manner. Lisa studied well, that is, diligently; especially brilliant abilities, God did not reward her with a great mind; Nothing came easy for her. She played the piano well; but Lemm alone knew what it cost her. She read a little; she did not have ""her own words"", but she had her own thoughts, and she went her own way. No wonder she looked like her father: he also did not ask others what to do. So she grew up - calmly, unhurriedly, so she reached the age of nineteen. She was very sweet without knowing it. In her every movement there was an involuntary, somewhat awkward grace; her voice sounded like the silver of untouched youth; the slightest sensation of pleasure evoked an attractive smile on her lips, imparted a deep brilliance and some kind of secret tenderness to her luminous eyes. All imbued with a sense of duty, fear of offending anyone, with a kind and meek heart, she loved everyone and no one in particular; she loved one God enthusiastically, timidly, tenderly. Lavretsky was the first to disturb her quiet inner life. That was Lisa.","Agafya, however, did not get on with Marfa Timofeyevna when the latter moved into the Kalitin house. The stern solemnity of the former ‘peasant’ had no appeal for the self-willed and impatient old lady. Agafya asked to be allowed to go on a pilgrimage and did not return. Dark rumours circulated that she had joined a sect of Raskolniks. But the trace left by her in Liza’s soul was not erased. She went as before to Mass, as if going on an outing, and said her prayers with enjoyment, with a kind of restrained and shamefaced excess of feeling which was a source of no little secret wonder to Marya Dmitrievna, and Marfa Timofeyevna herself, although she did not inhibit Liza in any way, tried to make her moderate her fervour and would not allow her to make too many obeisances to the ground: that, she said, was not the way the gentry did things. Liza learned her lessons well, that is to say assiduously; God had not endowed her with particularly remarkable capabilities or great cleverness; nothing came easily to her. She played the piano well; but Lemm alone knew how much that had cost her. She read little; she had no ‘words of her own’, but she had her own ideas and she went her own way. It was not for nothing that she resembled her father: she also never asked others what to do. So she grew up, calmly and unhurriedly, and had reached nineteen years of age. She was very charming without knowing it. Her every movement bespoke an involuntary, slightly awkward gracefulness; her voice rang with the silvery ring of immaculate youth; the slightest sensation of happiness brought an attractive smile to her lips and endowed her brightening eyes with a profound lustre and a kind of secret kindliness. Permeated with a feeling of duty, with a fear of offending anyone, with a kindness and meekness of heart, she loved the whole world and no one in particular; God alone she loved exultantly, shyly, tenderly. Lavretsky was the first person to disturb her calm inner life. Such was Liza.","Agafya did not, however, get on well with Marfa Timofyevna, when she came to live in the Kalitins’ house. Such gravity and dignity on the part of one who had once worn the motley skirt of a peasant wench displeased the impatient and self-willed old lady. Agafya asked leave to go on a pilgrimage and she never came back. There were dark rumours that she had gone off to a retreat of sectaries. But the impression she had left in Lisa’s soul was never obliterated. She went as before to the mass as to a festival, she prayed with rapture, with a kind of restrained and shamefaced transport, at which Marya Dmitrievna secretly marvelled not a little, and even Marfa Timofyevna, though she did not restrain Lisa in any way, tried to temper her zeal, and would not let her make too many prostrations to the earth in her prayers ; it was not a lady-like habit, she would say. In her studies Lisa worked well, that is to say perseveringly; she was not gifted with specially brilliant abilities, or great intellect; she could not succeed in anything without labour. She played the piano well, but only Lemm knew what it had cost her. She had read little; she had not “words of her own,” but she had her own ideas, and she went her own way. It was not only on the surface that she took after her father; he, too, had never asked other people what was to be done. So she had grown up tranquilly and restfully till she had reached the age of nineteen. She was very charming, without being aware of it herself. Her every movement was full of spontaneous, somewhat awkward gracefulness; her voice had the silvery ring of untouched youth, the least feeling of pleasure called forth an enchanting smile on her lips, and added a deep light and a kind of mystic sweetness to her kindling eyes. Penetrated through and through by a sense of duty, by the dread of hurting any one whatever, with a kind and tender heart, she had loved all men, and no one in particular; God only she had! loved passionately, timidly, and tenderly. Lavretsky was the first to break in upon her peaceful inner life. Such was Lisa."

"– Ах, как вам не стыдно так говорить! Она пела и играла для того только, чтобы сделать мне угодное, потому что я настоятельно ее просила об этом, почти приказывала ей. Я вижу, что ей тяжело, так тяжело; думаю, чем бы ее развлечь, – да и слышала-то я, что талант у ней такой прекрасный! Помилуйте, Федор Иваныч, она совсем уничтожена, спросите хоть Сергея Петровича; убитая женщина, tout-a-fait[58], что вы это? Лаврецкий только плечами пожал.","""Ah, aren't you ashamed to say that! She sang and played only to please me, because I urgently asked her about it, almost ordered her. I can see that it's hard for her, so hard; I think about how to entertain her - and I heard that she has such a wonderful talent! For mercy, Fyodor Ivanovich, she is completely destroyed, just ask Sergei Petrovich; murdered woman, tout-a-fait[58], what are you? Lavretsky only shrugged his shoulders.","‘Ah, you ought to be ashamed of what you’re saying! She sang and played simply to do me a favour, because I insisted she should, almost ordered her to. I saw that things were so hard for her, so very hard; I wondered how to distract her – and I’d heard that she had such a splendid talent! Believe me, Fyodor Ivanych, she is quite shattered, ask Sergey Petrovich if you like – a broken woman, tout à fait. So how can you ask such a question?’ Lavretsky simply shrugged his shoulders.","“Ah, I wonder you are not ashamed to talk like that! She sang and played the piano only to do me a kindness, because I positively entreated, almost commanded her to do so. I saw that she was sad, so sad; I thought how to distract her mind—and I heard that she had such marvellous talent!

"– Эх, Варвара Павловна, – перебил ее Лаврецкий, – вы умная женщина, да ведь и я не дурак; я знаю, что этого вам совсем не нужно. А я давно вас простил; но между нами всегда была бездна.","“Oh, Varvara Pavlovna,” Lavretsky interrupted her, “you are a clever woman, but I’m not a fool either; I know you don't need it at all. And I forgave you a long time ago; but there was always an abyss between us.","‘Oh, Varvara Pavlovna,’ Lavretsky interrupted her, ‘you’re a clever woman, but I’m also no fool ; I know you don’t need that at all.

"– Постойте, Марья Дмитриевна, – перебил ее Лаврецкий глухим, но потрясающим голосом. – Вы, вероятно, любите чувствительные сцены (Лаврецкий не ошибался: Марья Дмитриевна еще с института сохранила страсть к некоторой театральности); они вас забавляют; но другим от них плохо приходится. Впрочем, я с вами говорить не буду: в этой сцене не вы главное действующее лицо. Что вы хотите от меня, сударыня? – прибавил он, обращаясь к жене. – Не сделал ли я для вас, что мог? Не возражайте мне, что не вы затеяли это свидание; я вам не поверю, – и вы знаете, что я вам верить не могу. Что же вы хотите? Вы умны, – вы ничего не делаете без цели. Вы должны понять, что жить с вами, как я жил прежде, я не в состоянии; не оттого, что я на вас сержусь, а оттого, что я стал другим человеком. Я сказал вам это на второй же день вашего возвращения, и вы сами, в это мгновенье, в душе со мной согласны. Но вы желаете восстановить себя в общем мнении; вам мало жить у меня в доме, вы желаете жить со мной под одной кровлей – не правда ли?","""Wait a minute, Marya Dmitrievna,"" Lavretsky interrupted her in a hollow but amazing voice. - You probably like sensitive scenes (Lavretsky was not mistaken: Marya Dmitrievna, even from the institute, retained a passion for some theatricality); they amuse you; but others are badly off them. However, I will not talk to you: in this scene you are not the main character. What do you want from me, ma'am? he added, turning to his wife. Have I done what I could for you? Do not object to me that you did not start this meeting; I won't believe you - and you know that I can't believe you. What do you want? You are smart - you do nothing without a purpose. You must understand that I am not able to live with you as I lived before; not because I'm angry with you, but because I've become a different person. I told you this on the very second day of your return, and you yourself, at this moment, agree with me in your soul. But you wish to restore yourself to the general opinion; It’s not enough for you to live in my house, you want to live with me under the same roof, don’t you?","‘Stop, Marya Dmitrievna,’ Lavretsky interrupted her in a hollow but impressive voice. ‘ No doubt you’re fond of emotional scenes’ (Lavretsky was not mistaken: since her schooldays Marya Dmitrievna had retained a passion for theatricality); ‘they amuse you; but others may come out of them badly. However, I don’t intend to talk to you: in this scene you’re not the principal character. What do you want from me, madam?’ he added, turning to his wife. ‘ Haven’t I done what I can for you? Don’t retort that you were not the one who contrived this meeting – I won’t believe you, and you know I can’t believe you. What do you want? You’re clever. You don’t do anything without a purpose. You must understand that I have no inclination to live with you as I lived before, not because I am angry with you but because I have become a different person. I told you that the day after you returned, and in your soul, at this moment, you know you agree with me. But you want to rehabilitate yourself in the eyes of the world; it’s not enough for you to live in my house , you want to live with me under the same roof – isn’t that so?’","“Stop a minute, Marya Dmitrievna,” said Lavretsky in a low but startlingly impressive voice. “I dare say you are fond of affecting scenes” (Lavretsky was right, Marya Dmitrievna still retained her school-girl’s passion for a little melodramatic effect), “they amuse you; but they may be anything but pleasant for other people. But I am not going to talk to you; in this scene you are not the principal character. What do you want to get out of me, madam?” he added, turning to his wife. “Haven’t I done all I could for you? Don’t tell me you did not contrive this interview ; I shall not believe you—and you know that I cannot possibly believe you. What is it you want? You are clever—you do nothing without an object. You must realise, that as for living with, as I once lived with you, that I cannot do; not because I am angry with you, but because I have become a different man. I told you so the day after your return, and you yourself, at that moment, agreed with me in your! heart. But you want to reinstate yourself in public opinion; it is not enough for you to live in my house, you want to live with me under the same roof—isn’t that it?”"

"Лаврецкий написал жене, что не нуждается в ответе… но он ждал, он жаждал ответа, объяснения этого непонятного, непостижимого дела. Варвара Павловна в тот же день прислала ему большое французское письмо. Оно его доконало; последние его сомнения исчезли – и ему стало стыдно, что у него оставались еще сомнения. Варвара Павловна не оправдывалась: она желала толь– ко увидать его, умоляла не осуждать ее безвозвратно. Письмо было холодно и напряженно, хотя кой-где виднелись пятна слез. Лаврецкий усмехнулся горько и велел сказать через посланного, что все очень хорошо. Три дня спустя его уже не было в Париже: но он поехал не в Россию, а в Италию. Он сам не знал, почему он выбрал именно Италию; ему, в сущности, было все равно, куда ни ехать – лишь бы не домой. Он послал предписание своему бурмистру насчет жениной пенсии, приказывая ему в то же время немедленно принять от генерала Коробьина все дела по имению, не дожидаясь сдачи счетов, и распорядиться о выезде его превосходительства из Лавриков; живо представил он себе смущение, тщетную величавость изгоняемого генерала и, при всем своем горе, почувствовал некоторое злобное удовольствие. Тогда же попросил он в письме Глафиру Петровну вернуться в Лаврики и отправил на ее имя доверенность; Глафира Петровна в Лаврики не вернулась и сама припечатала в газетах об уничтожении доверенности, что было совершенно излишне. Скрываясь в небольшом италианском городке, Лаврецкий еще долго не мог заставить себя не следить за женою. Из газет он узнал, что она из Парижа поехала, как располагала, в Баден-Баден; имя ее скоро появилось в статейке, подписанной тем же мусье Жюлем. В этой статейке сквозь обычную игривость проступало какое-то дружественное соболезнование; очень гадко сделалось на душе Федора Иваныча при чтении этой статейки. Потом он узнал, что у него родилась дочь; месяца через два получил он от бурмистра извещение о том, что Варвара Павловна вытребовала себе первую треть своего жалованья. Потом стали ходить все более и более дурные слухи; наконец с шумом пронеслась по всем журналам трагикомическая история, в которой жена его играла незавидную роль. Все было кончено: Варвара Павловна стала «известностью».","Lavretsky wrote to his wife that he did not need an answer ... but he waited, he longed for an answer, an explanation of this incomprehensible, incomprehensible matter. Varvara Pavlovna sent him a large French letter the same day. It finished him off; his last doubts disappeared - and he felt ashamed that he still had doubts. Varvara Pavlovna made no excuses: she only wanted to see him, she begged him not to condemn her irrevocably. The letter was cold and tense, though there were spots of tears here and there. Lavretsky grinned bitterly and ordered him to say through the messenger that everything was very good. Three days later he was no longer in Paris: but he did not go to Russia, but to Italy. He himself did not know why he had chosen Italy; he didn't really care where he went, as long as it wasn't home. He sent an order to his steward about his wife's pension, ordering him at the same time to immediately take over from General Korobin all the affairs of the estate, without waiting for the payment of accounts, and to order His Excellency to leave Lavrikov; he vividly imagined the embarrassment, the vain majesty of the exiled general, and, for all his grief, he felt a certain malicious pleasure. Then he asked in a letter to Glafira Petrovna to return to Lavriki and sent a power of attorney to her; Glafira Petrovna did not return to Lavriki and herself printed in the newspapers about the destruction of the power of attorney, which was completely unnecessary. Hiding in a small Italian town, Lavretsky for a long time could not force himself not to follow his wife. He learned from the newspapers that she had gone from Paris, as she pleased, to Baden-Baden; her name soon appeared in an article signed by the same Monsieur Jules. In this article, a kind of friendly condolence showed through the usual playfulness; The soul of Fyodor Ivanovich felt very disgusting when he read this article. Then he learned that his daughter was born; About two months later he received a notice from the steward that Varvara Pavlovna had demanded the first third of her salary. Then more and more bad rumors began to circulate; finally, a tragicomic story in which his wife played an unenviable role swept through all the magazines with a bang. It was all over: Varvara Pavlovna became ""famous.""","Lavretsky wrote to his wife that there was no need for an answer… but he waited, thirsted for an answer, for an explanation of this incomprehensible, inexplicable matter. That very same day Varvara Pavlovna sent him a long letter in French. It was the final blow; his last doubts vanished – and he felt ashamed that he had still entertained doubts. Varvara Pavlovna did not attempt to justify herself; she wished only to see him and begged him not to condemn her irrevocably. The letter was cold and strained, although in places there were traces of tears. Lavretsky gave a bitter smile and ordered the messenger to say that everything was quite all right. Three days later he had left Paris, though he travelled not to Russia but to Italy. He did not know precisely why he chose Italy; it didn’t matter to him in essence where he went – so long as it wasn’t home. He sent instructions to his bailiff about his wife’s allowance, simultaneously ordering him immediately to take over the affairs of the estate from General Korobyn, without waiting for the accounts to be made up, and to arrange for His Excellency’s departure from Lavriki; he painted a lively picture for himself of the confusion and majestic bewilderment of the expelled general and, despite all his grief, experienced a certain malicious satisfaction. Then he wrote to Glafira Petrovna asking her to return to Lavriki and sent off a power of attorney in her name; Glafira Petrovna did not return to Lavriki and herself had printed in the newspapers a statement about the annulment of the power of attorney, which was completely unnecessary. Taking refuge in a small Italian town, Lavretsky was unable to refrain for a long time from following the doings of his wife. From the papers he learned that she had left Paris, as arranged, for Baden-Baden; her name soon appeared in a little notice signed by the same M. Jules. Through the usual playfulness of this notice emerged a kind of amicable condolence; intense repugnance filled Fyodor Ivanych’s soul when he read it. Later he learned that a daughter had been born; in a couple of months he received news from his bailiff that Varvara Pavlovna had asked for the first third of her allowance. Later ever-worsening rumours became current; finally all the journals noised about a tragi-comic story in which his wife played an unenviable role. Everything was over: Varvara Pavlovna had become a ‘notoriety’.","Lavretsky wrote to his wife that he needed no answer... but he waited, he thirsted for a reply, for an explanation of this incredible, inconceivable thing. Varvara Pavlovna wrote him the same day a long letter in French. It put the finishing touch; his last doubts vanished,—and he began to feel ashamed that he had still had any doubt left. Varvara Pavlovna did not attempt to defend herself; her only desire was to see him, she besought him not to condemn her irrevocably. The letter was cold and constrained, though here and there traces of tears were visible. Lavretsky smiled bitterly, and sent word by the messenger that it was all right. Three days later he was no longer in Paris; but he did not go to Russia, but to Italy. He did not know himself why he fixed upon Italy; he did not really care where he went—so long as it was not home. He sent instructions to his steward on the subject of his wife’s allowance, and at the same time told him to take all control of his property out of General Korobyin’s hands at once, without waiting for him to draw up an account, and to make arrangements for his Excellency’s departure from Lavriky; he could picture vividly the confusion, the vain airs of self-importance of the dispossessed general, and in the midst of all his sorrow, he felt a kind of spiteful satisfaction. At the same time he asked Glafira Petrovna by letter to return to Lavriky, and drew up a deed authorising her to take possession; Glafira Petrovna did not return to Lavriky, and printed in the newspapers that the deed was cancelled, which was perfectly unnecessary on her part. Lavretsky kept out of sight in a small Italian town, but for a long time he could not help following his wife’s movements. From the newspapers he learned that she had gone from Paris to Baden as she had arranged; her name soon appeared in an article written by the same M. Jules. In this article there was a kind of sympathetic condolence apparent under the habitual playfulness; there was a deep sense of disgust in the soul of Fedor Ivanitch as he read this article. Afterwards he learned that a daughter had been born to him; two months later he received a notification from his steward that Varvara Pavlovna had asked for the first quarter’s allowance. Then worse and worse rumors began to reach him; at last, a tragic-comic story was reported with acclamations in all the papers. His wife played an unenviable part in it. It was the finishing stroke; Varvara Pavlovna had become a “notoriety.”"
"Гости поняли намек и начали прощаться. Варвара Павловна должна была обещать, что приедет обедать на следующий день и прквезет Аду; Гедеоновский, который чуть было не заснул, сидя в углу, вызвался ее проводить до дому. Паншин торжественно раскланялся со всеми, а на крыльце, подсаживая Варвару Павловну в карету, пожал ей руку и закричал вслед: «Au revoir!»[56] Гедеоновский сел с ней рядом; она всю дорогу забавлялась тем, что ставила, будто не нарочно, кончик своей ножки на его ногу; он конфузился, говорил ей комплименты; она хихикала и делала ему глазки, когда свет от уличного фонаря западал в карету. Сыгранный ею самою вальс звенел у ней в голове, волновал ее; где бы она ни находилась, стоило ей только представить себе огни, бальную залу, быстрое круженье под звуки музыки – и душа в ней так и загоралась, глаза странно меркли, улыбка блуждала на губах, что-то грациозно-вакхическое разливалось по всему телу. Приехавши домой, Варвара Павловна легко выскочила из кареты – только львицы умеют так выскакивать, – обернулась к Гедеоновскому и вдруг расхохоталась звонким хохотом прямо ему в нос.","The guests took the hint and began to say goodbye. Varvara Pavlovna had to promise that she would come to dinner the next day and deliver to Ada; Gedeonovsky, who almost fell asleep while sitting in the corner, volunteered to walk her home. Panshin solemnly bowed to everyone, and on the porch, putting Varvara Pavlovna into the carriage, he shook hands with her and shouted after her: ""Au revoir!""[56] Gedeonovsky sat down beside her; all the way she amused herself by putting, as if not on purpose, the tip of her foot on his leg; he was embarrassed, he complimented her; she giggled and made eyes at him as the light from the street lamp fell into the carriage. The waltz she herself had played rang in her head, excited her; wherever she was, she had only to imagine the lights, the ballroom, the rapid whirling to the sounds of music - and her soul lit up in her, her eyes dimmed strangely, a smile wandered on her lips, something gracefully Bacchic spread over her whole body. Arriving home, Varvara Pavlovna jumped out of the carriage easily—only lionesses know how to jump out like that—turned to Gedeonovsky and suddenly burst out laughing with ringing laughter right into his nose.","The guests took the hint and began to say good-bye. Varvara Pavlovna had to promise that she would come to dinner the next day and bring Ada; Gedeonovsky, who had almost fallen asleep sitting in the corner, was called on to accompany her home. Panshin bowed ceremoniously to everyone and on the front steps, as he helped Varvara Pavlovna into the carriage, squeezed her hand and cried out as she left: ‘Au revoir!’ Gedeonovsky sat beside her; she entertained herself the whole journey by placing the tip of her foot apparently unintentionally against his leg; he was confused and paid her compliments; she giggled and made eyes at him when the light from a street lamp fell into the carriage. The waltz which she had played rang in her head and excited her; no matter where she was, she had only to imagine to herself lights, a ballroom and rapid circling to the sound of music for her soul literally to catch fire, her eyes to become strangely glassy, a smile to hover on her lips and something elegantly Bacchanalian to pervade her whole body. Reaching home, Varvara Pavlovna skipped lightly out of the carriage – only lionesses can skip out like that – swung round to Gedeonovsky and suddenly burst into ringing laughter right under his nose.","Her guests took the hint and began to say good-bye. Varvara Pavlovna had to promise that she would come to dinner the following day and bring Ada. Gedeonovsky, who had all but fallen asleep sitting in his corner, offered to escort her home. Panshin took leave solemnly of all, but at the steps as he put Varvara Pavlovna into her carriage he pressed her hand, and cried after her, “au revoir!” Gedeonovsky sat beside her all the way home. She amused herself by pressing the tip of her little foot as though accidentally on his foot; he was thrown into confusion and began paying her compliments. She tittered and made eyes at him when the light of a street lamp fell into the carriage. The waltz she had played was ringing in her head, and exciting her; whatever position she might find herself in, she had only to imagine lights, a ballroom, rapid whirling to the strains of music—and her blood was on fire, her eyes glittered strangely, a smile strayed about her lips, and something of bacchanalian grace was visible over her whole frame. When she reached home Varvara Pavlovna bounded lightly out of the carriage—only real lionesses know how to bound like that—and turning round to Gedeonovsky she burst suddenly into a ringing laugh right in his face."

"– Да что ж ты бранишься! – вопил в свою очередь Лаврецкий. – Работать… делать… Скажи лучше, что делать, а не бранись, Демосфен полтавский!","- Yes, what are you scolding! cried Lavretsky in his turn. - Work ... do ... Tell me better what to do, and do not scold, Demosthenes of Poltava!","‘What’s all this scolding!’ Lavretsky howled in his turn. ‘Work… activity…. Just you say what ought to be done, and stop scolding, you Poltavan Demosthenes!’","“But what is all this abuse about?” Lavretsky clamoured in his turn. “Work—doing—you’d better say what is to be done, instead of abusing me, Desmosthenes of Poltava!”"

"– Что я скажу? – угрюмо возразил Лемм. – Ничего я не скажу. Все умерло, и мы умерли (Alles ist todt, und wir sind todt). Ведь вам направо идти?","– What will I say? Lemm objected sullenly. - I won't say anything. Everything died and we died (Alles ist todt, und wir sind todt). Are you going to the right?","‘What do I have to say?’ Lemm replied gloomily. ‘I have nothing to say. Everything is dead, and we’re dead. (Alles ist todt, und wir sind todt.) You’re going to the right, aren’t you?’","“What have I to say?” returned Lemm, grimly. “I have nothing to say. All is dead, and we are dead ( Alles ist todt, und wir sind todt).

"– Какую книжку, тетенька?","- What book, auntie?","‘What book, auntie?’","“What book, auntie?”"
"– То есть он не… Да, да, понимаю, – промолвила Марья Дмитриевна. – Он только с виду немного груб, а сердце у него мягкое.","- That is, he is not ... Yes, yes, I understand, - said Marya Dmitrievna. “He only looks a little rough, but his heart is soft.","‘That’s to say, he didn’t…. Yes, yes, I understand,’ Marya Dmitrievna said. ‘He only gives the appearance of being a little uncouth, but he has a soft heart.’","“That is to say, he did not...

"Марья Дмитриевна уронила карты и завозилась на кресле; Варвара Павловна посмотрела на нее с полуусмешкой, потом обратила взоры на дверь. Появился Паншин, в черном фраке, в высоких английских воротничках, застегнутый доверху. «Мне было тяжело повиноваться; но вы видите, я приехал» – вот что выражало его неулыбавшееся, только что выбритое лицо.","Marya Dmitrievna dropped her cards and fidgeted in her chair; Varvara Pavlovna looked at her with a half smile, then turned her eyes towards the door.

Ты жив еще?","“Hello, hello, brother,” Lavretsky said, “I think your name is Anton?” Are you still alive?","‘Good to see you, my good chap,’ said Lavretsky. ‘You’re called Anton, aren’t you? Can you still be alive?’","“How do you do, how do you do, brother?” began Lavretsky. “Your name’s Anton, I think? You are still alive, then?”"
"– А! – промолвил Лаврецкий и умолк. Полупечальное, полунасмешливое выражение промелькнуло у него на лице. Упорный взгляд его смущал Лизу, но она продолжала улыбаться. – Ну, и дай бог им счастья! – пробормотал он, наконец, как будто про себя, и отворотил голову. Лиза покраснела.","- BUT! said Lavretsky, and fell silent. A half-sad, half-mocking look crossed his face. His stubborn gaze embarrassed Liza, but she continued to smile. Well, God bless them! he muttered at last, as if to himself, and turned his head away. Lisa blushed.","‘Ah!’ Lavretsky said and was silent.

"Два дня спустя Марья Дмитриевна, по обещанию, прибыла со всей своей молодежью в Васильевское. Девочки побежали тотчас в сад, а Марья Дмитриевна томно прошлась по комнатам и томно все похвалила. Визит свой Лаврецкому она считала знаком великого снисхожденья, чуть не добрым поступком. Она приветливо улыбнулась, когда Антон и Апраксея, по старинной дворовой привычке, подошли к ней к ручке, и расслабленным голосом, в нос, попросила напиться чаю. К великой досаде Антона, надевшего вязаные белые перчатки, чай подал приезжей барыне не он, а наемный камердинер Лаврецкого, не понимавший, по словам старика, никаких порядков. Зато Антон за обедом взял свое: твердой стопою стал он за кресло Марьи Дмитриевны – и уже никому не уступил своего места. Давно не бывалое появление гостей в Васильевском и встревожило и обрадовало старика: ему было приятно видеть, что с его барином хорошие господа знаются. Впрочем, не он один волновался в тот день: Лемм волновался тоже. Он надел коротенький табачного цвета фрак с острым хвостиком, туго затянул свой шейный платок и беспрестанно откашливался и сторонился с приятным и приветливым видом. Лаврецкий с удовольствием заметил, что сближение между им и Лизой продолжалось: она, как только вошла, дружелюбно протянула ему руку. После обеда Лемм достал из заднего кармана фрака, куда он то и дело запускал руку, небольшой сверток нотной бумаги и, сжав губы, молча положил его на фортепьяно. Это был романс, сочиненный им накануне на старомодные немецкие слова, в которых упоминалось о звездах. Лиза тотчас села за фортепьяно и разобрала романс… Увы! музыка оказалась запутанной и неприятно напряженной; видно было, что композитор силился выразить что-то страстное, глубокое, но ничего не вышло: усилие так и осталось одним усилием. Лаврецкий и Лиза оба это почувствовали – и Лемм это понял: ни слова не сказав, положил он свой романс обратно в карман и, в ответ на предложение Лизы сыграть его еще раз, покачав только головой, значительно сказал: «Теперь – баста!» – сгорбился, съежился и отошел.","Two days later, Marya Dmitrievna, as promised, arrived with all her young people at Vasilyevskoye. The girls immediately ran into the garden, while Marya Dmitrievna walked languidly through the rooms and languidly praised everything. She considered her visit to Lavretsky a sign of great indulgence, almost a kind deed. She smiled affably when Anton and Apraksey, according to an old yard habit, approached her to the pen, and in a relaxed voice, through her nose, asked to drink tea. To the great annoyance of Anton, who was wearing knitted white gloves, it was not he who served tea to the visiting mistress, but Lavretsky's hired valet, who, according to the old man, did not understand any order. But Anton at dinner took his own: he stood with a firm foot behind Marya Dmitrievna's chair - and no longer gave up his place to anyone. The appearance of guests in Vasilievsky for a long time alarmed and delighted the old man: he was pleased to see that good gentlemen knew his master. However, he was not the only one who was worried that day: Lemm was worried too. He put on a short, tobacco-coloured tailcoat with a pointed ponytail, pulled his neckerchief tight, and cleared his throat incessantly and kept aloof with a pleasant and friendly air. Lavretsky noticed with pleasure that the rapprochement between him and Liza continued: as soon as she entered, she amiably extended her hand to him. After dinner, Lemm took from the back pocket of his tailcoat, into which he now and again put his hand, a small bundle of music paper, and, pursing his lips, silently placed it on the pianoforte. It was a romance he had composed the day before in old-fashioned German words that referred to the stars. Liza immediately sat down at the pianoforte and analyzed the romance... Alas! the music was confused and uncomfortably tense; it was evident that the composer was trying to express something passionate, profound, but nothing came of it: the effort remained just one effort. Lavretsky and Liza both felt this - and Lemm understood this: without saying a word, he put his romance back in his pocket and, in response to Lisa's suggestion to play it again, shaking his head, said significantly: ""Now - that's it!"" - hunched over, cringed and walked away.","TWO days later Marya Dmitrievna, according to her promise, arrived in Vasilyevskoye with all her young people. The little girls at once ran into the garden, while Marya Dmitrievna made a languid tour of the rooms and languidly praised everything. Her visit to Lavretsky she regarded as a mark of her great condescension, almost as an act of virtue. She graciously smiled when Anton and Apraxia, in the old-fashioned house-serf style, kissed her hand, and in a limp voice, nasally, asked if she might have some tea. To the profound annoyance of Anton, who had put on white knitted gloves for the occasion, tea was poured for the lady visitor not by him but by Lavretsky’s hired man who had no understanding, in the old man’s words, of the proper order of things. However, he came into his own at lunch-time: with a firm step he took his place by Marya Dmitrievna’s chair and would not surrender his place to anyone. The long unfamiliar arrival of guests at Vasilyevskoye both alarmed and delighted the old man: it pleased him to see that people of such good standing knew his master. Yet he was not the only one to be excited that day: Lemm was also excited. He had put on a short tobacco-coloured swallow-tail coat and tied his neck-tie tightly round his neck, and he ceaselessly cleared his throat and made way for people with a pleasantly welcoming expression. Lavretsky noted with satisfaction that the intimacy between him and Liza was continuing: as soon as she had entered the house she had amicably offered him her hand. After the meal Lemm extracted from the rear pocket of his coat, where he had from time to time been putting his hand, a small rolled-up sheet of music and, pursing his lips, silently laid it on the piano. It was a romance, composed by him the previous day to old-fashioned German words which made mention of the stars. Liza at once sat down at the piano and started to play. Alas! the music turned out to be involved and unpleasantly strained; it was apparent that the composer had striven to express something passionate and profound, but nothing had come of it: the striving remained striving and nothing more. Lavretsky and Liza both felt this – and Lemm understood: without a word, he replaced his romance in his pocket and, in response to Liza’s proposal that he should play it over again, simply gave a shake of the head, said significantly: ‘ Now – that ’s all!’ , hunched his shoulders, cringed into himself and left the room.","Two days later, Marya Dmitrievna visited Vassilyevskoe according to her promise, with all her young people. The little girls ran at once into the garden, while Marya Dmitrievna languidly walked through the rooms and languidly admired everything. She regarded her visit to Lavretsky as a sign of great condescension, almost as a deed of charity. She smiled graciously when Anton and Apraxya kissed her hand in the old-fashioned house-servants’ style; and in a weak voice, speaking through her nose, asked for some tea. To the great vexation of Anton, who had put on knitted white gloves for the purpose, tea was not handed to the grand lady visitor by him, but by Lavretsky’s hired valet, who in the old man’s words, had not a notion of what was proper. To make up for this, Anton resumed his rights at dinner: he took up a firm position behind Marya Dmitrievna’s chair; and he would not surrender his post to any one. The appearance of guests after so long an interval at Vassilyevskoe fluttered and delighted the old man. It was a pleasure to him to see that his master was acquainted with such fine gentlefolk. He was not, however, the only one who was fluttered that day; Lemm, too, was in agitation. He had put on a rather short snuff-coloured coat with a swallow-tail, and tied his neck handkerchief stiffly, and he kept incessantly coughing and making way for people with a cordial and affable air. Lavretsky noticed with pleasure that his relations with Lisa were becoming more intimate; she had held out her hand to him affectionately directly she came in. After dinner Lemm drew out of his coat-tail pocket, into which he had continually been fumbling, a small roll of music-paper and compressing his lips he laid it without speaking on the pianoforte. It was a song composed by him the evening before, to some old-fashioned German words, in which mention was made of the stars. Lisa sat down at once to the piano and played at sight the song.... Alas! the music turned out to be complicated and painfully strained; it was clear that the composer had striven to express something passionate and deep, but nothing had come of it; the effort had remained an effort. Lavretsky and Lisa both felt this, and Lemm understood it. Without uttering a single word, he put his song back into his pocket, and in reply to Lisa’s proposal to play it again, he only shook his head and said significantly: “Now—enough!” and shrinking into himself he turned away."
"– Да, – произнесла Лиза и прямо и серьезно посмотрела Лаврецкому в глаза. Лаврецкий, в свою очередь, серьезно посмотрел на Лизу.","""Yes,"" said Liza, and looked directly and seriously into Lavretsky's eyes. Lavretsky, in turn, looked seriously at Lisa.","‘Yes,’ uttered Liza and looked at Lavretsky directly and seriously in the eyes. Lavretsky, in his turn, looked seriously at Liza.","“Yes,” replied Lisa, looking Lavretsky straight in the face with a serious expression. Lavretsky on his side looked seriously at Lisa."
"– Она к обедне шла, – продолжал Лаврецкий. – Разве она богомольна?","“She was on her way to mass,” continued Lavretsky. - Is she devout?","‘She was going to Mass,’ Lavretsky continued. ‘She isn’t religious, is she?’","“She has gone to church,” continued Lavretsky. “Is she religious?”"
– Пока еще нет.,- Not yet.,‘Not so far.’,“Not yet.”

"– Не сердитесь, простите меня, – торопливо произнесла Лиза. В это мгновенье вошла Марья Дмитриевна. Лиза встала и хотела удалиться.","“Don’t be angry, forgive me,” Liza said hastily. At that moment Marya Dmitrievna entered. Lisa got up and wanted to leave.","‘Don’t be angry, forgive me,’ Liza uttered hurriedly. At that moment Marya Dmitrievna entered. Liza stood up and wanted to leave.","“Don’t be angry, forgive me,” Lisa faltered hurriedly. At that instant Marya Dmitrievna came in. Lisa got up and was going away."
"– Я вас люблю, – проговорил он снова, – я готов отдать вам всю жизнь мою.","“I love you,” he said again, “I am ready to give you my whole life.","‘I love you,’ he said again. ‘I’m ready to give up my life for you.’","“I love you,” he said again. “I am ready to devote my whole life to you.”"
"Лиза медленно взглянула на него; казалось, она только в это мгновение поняла, где она и что с нею. Она хотела подняться, не могла и закрыла лицо руками.","Lisa looked at him slowly; it seemed that only at that moment did she realize where she was and what was happening to her. She wanted to get up, but she couldn't and covered her face with her hands.","Liza looked slowly up at him; it seemed she had only that instant realized where she was and what was happening to her. She wanted to get up, couldn’t make herself and covered her face with her hands.","Lisa slowly looked at him. It seemed as though she only at that instant knew where she was and what was happening. She tried to get up, she could no, and she covered her face with her hands."
"– Я завтра же отправляюсь туда, в исполнение его воли; но я почла долгом побывать прежде у вас.","“Tomorrow I am going there, in fulfillment of his will; but I felt it my duty to visit you first.","‘I am going there tomorrow, in fulfilment of his wishes; but I considered it my duty to pay you a visit beforehand.’",“I am setting off there to-morrow in fulfilment of his wish; but I esteemed it a duty to visit you first.”
"Такими-то рассуждениями старался помочь Лаврецкий своему горю, но оно было велико и сильно; и сама выжившая не столько из ума, сколько изо всякого чувства, Апраксея покачала головой и печально проводила его глазами, когда он сел в тарантас, чтобы ехать в город. Лошади скакали; он сидел неподвижно и прямо, и неподвижно глядел вперед на дорогу.","With such reasoning Lavretsky tried to help his grief, but it was great and strong; and herself surviving not so much from her mind as from every feeling, Apraksei shook her head and sadly followed him with her eyes when he got into the tarantass to go to the city.
