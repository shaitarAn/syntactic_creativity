"Вот был мой путь: от части к целому; часть – R-13, величественное целое – наш Институт Государственных Поэтов и Писателей. Я думал: как могло случиться, что древним не бросалась в глаза вся нелепость их литературы и поэзии. Огромнейшая великолепная сила художественного слова – тратилась совершенно зря. Просто смешно: всякий писал – о чем ему вздумается. Так же смешно и нелепо, как то, что море у древних круглые сутки тупо билось о берег, и заключенные в волнах силлионы килограммометров – уходили только на подогревание чувств у влюбленных. Мы из влюбленного шепота волн – добыли электричество, из брызжущего бешеной пеной зверя – мы сделали домашнее животное: и точно так же у нас приручена и оседлана когда-то дикая стихия поэзии. Теперь поэзия – уже не беспардонный соловьиный свист: поэзия – государственная служба, поэзия – полезность.","That was my way: from the part to the whole; the part is R-13, the majestic whole is our Institute of State Poets and Writers. I thought: how could it happen that the ancients did not catch the eye of all the absurdity of their literature and poetry. The enormous magnificent power of the artistic word was wasted completely in vain. It's just ridiculous: everyone wrote - what he pleases. It is just as ridiculous and absurd as the fact that the sea of the ancients stupidly beat against the shore all day and night, and millions of kilometers enclosed in the waves - went only to warm up the feelings of lovers. From the loving whisper of the waves we have obtained electricity, from the beast splashing with furious foam we have made a domestic animal: and in the same way we have tamed and saddled the once wild element of poetry. Now poetry is no longer a shameless nightingale whistle: poetry is a public service, poetry is utility.","This was my way of thinking: from the part to the whole,—R-13 is the part; the whole is our Institution of State Poets and Authors. I thought: how was it that the ancients did not notice the utter absurdity of their prose and poetry? The gigantic, magnificent power of the artistic word was spent by them in vain. It is really droll; anybody wrote whatever happened to come into his head! It was as foolish as the fact that in the days of the ancients the ocean blindly splashed at the shore for twenty-four hours without interruption or use. The millions of kilogram-meters of energy which were hidden in the waves were used only for the stimulation of sweethearts! We obtained electricity from the amorous whisper of the waves! We made a domestic animal out of that sparkling, foaming, rabid one! And in the same manner we domesticated and harnessed the wild element of poetry. Now poetry is no longer the unpardonable whistling of nightingales but a State Service! Poetry is a commodity.","My reflections proceeded from the part to the whole: the part, R-13; the majestic whole, our Institute of State Poets and Writers. I wondered at the ancients who had never realized the utter absurdity of their literature and poetry. The enormous, magnificent power of the literary word was completely wasted. It's simply ridiculous—everyone wrote anything he pleased. Just as ridiculous and absurd as the fact that the ancients allowed the ocean to beat dully at the shore twenty-four hours a day, while the millions of kilogrammometers of energy residing in the waves went only to heighten lovers' feelings. But we have extracted electricity from the amorous whisper of the waves; we have transformed the savage, foam-spitting beast into a domestic animal; and in the same way we have tamed and harnessed the once wild element of poetry. Today, poetry is no longer the idle, impudent whistling of a nightingale; poetry is civic service, poetry is useful.","This was my thought path: from the parts to the whole. The part was R-13 and the majestic whole was our Institute of State Poets and Writers. I thought: how could it be that the utter silliness of their literature and poetry didn’t fling itself into the eyes of the Ancients? The tremendous, splendid force of the artistic word was wasted absolutely in vain. It’s pure comedy: anyone wrote about whatever he took it in his head to write. It’s just as comic and ridiculous that the oceans of the Ancients beat stupidly against their shores, night and day, and that the millions of kilogram-meters contained in these waves were only expended as kindling for the feelings of lovers. We, from those amorous whispers of the waves, procured electricity. From the beast, gushing with rabid froth, we made a domestic animal. And that is exactly how we tamed and saddled the once-wild natural force of poetry. Now poetry is no longer a brazen nightingale call. Poetry is a state service; poetry is purpose.","Here was the path I had to take: from the part to the whole. The part was R-13. The magnificent whole was our Institute of State Poets and Writers. How could it have happened, I wondered, that the ancients did not immediately see how completely idiotic their literature and poetry was. The immense majestic power of the artistic word was squandered for absolutely nothing. It’s simply ridiculous—everybody wrote about whatever popped into his head. It’s just as stupid and ridiculous as the fact that the ancients let the ocean go on dumbly beating against the shore around the clock, and the millions of kilogrammeters locked up inside the waves went for nothing but kindling lovers’ emotions. We’ve taken the waves’ sweet nothings and turned them into electricity ... taken a mad crashing foaming beast and turned it into a domestic animal. In just the same way we’ve tamed and saddled what used to be the wild nature of poetry. Poetry today is not some impudent nightingale’s piping—poetry is government service, poetry is usefulness.","This was my way of thinking: from the part to the whole—R-13 is the part, the whole is our Institution of State Poets and Authors.

"Вы, читающие эти записки, – кто бы вы ни были, но над вами солнце. И если вы тоже когда-нибудь были так больны, как я сейчас, вы знаете, какое бывает – какое может быть – утром солнце, вы знаете это розовое, прозрачное, теплое золото. И самый воздух – чуть розовый, и все пропитано нежной солнечной кровью, все – живое: живые и все до одного улыбаются – люди. Может случиться, через час исчезнет, через час выкаплет розовая кровь, но пока – живое. И я вижу: пульсирует и переливается что-то в стеклянных соках «Интеграла»; я вижу: «Интеграл» мыслит о великом и страшном своем будущем, о тяжком грузе неизбежного счастья, которое он понесет туда вверх, вам, неведомым, вам, вечно ищущим и никогда не находящим. Вы найдете, вы будете счастливы – вы обязаны быть счастливыми, и уже недолго вам ждать.","You who read these notes, whoever you are, the sun is above you.

It may happen, in an hour it will disappear, in an hour pink blood will spit out, but for now it is alive.

It may be that in a short while all this will disappear, that in an hour the pinkish blood of the sun will be drained out, but in the meantime everything is alive.

It may happen that an hour later everything might disappear and an hour later, that rosy blood might drain away, but for now everything is alive.

I can see: the Integral is contemplating its great and terrifying future, its heavy cargo of inescapable happiness, which it will carry up there, up to you, the unknown, you, who eternally search and never find. You will find you will be happy—you are obliged to be happy—and you haven’t much longer to wait.","Those of you reading these notes, wherever you are, you’ve got the sun above you.

"Так вот – если капнуть на идею «права». Даже у древних – наиболее взрослые знали: источник права – сила, право – функция от силы. И вот – две чашки весов! На одной – грамм, на другой – тонна, на одной – «я», на другой – «мы», Единое Государство. Не ясно ли: допускать, что у «я» могут быть какие-то «права» по отношению к Государству, и допускать, что грамм может уравновесить тонну, – это совершенно одно и то же. Отсюда – распределение: тонне – права, грамму – обязанности; и естественный путь от ничтожества к величию: забыть, что ты – грамм, и почувствовать себя миллионной долей тонны…","So - if you drop on the idea of ""right"". Even among the ancients, the most mature ones knew: the source of law is strength, law is a function of strength. And here are two scales! On one - a gram, on the other - a ton, on one - ""I"", on the other - ""we"", the United State. Isn't it clear: to admit that the ""I"" can have some ""rights"" in relation to the State, and to admit that a gram can balance a ton, is exactly the same thing. Hence - the distribution: a ton - rights, a gram - obligations; and the natural path from insignificance to greatness: forget that you are a gram and feel like a millionth part of a ton ...","Now if we put a drop of acid on the idea of “right”.... Even the ancients (the most mature of them) knew that the source of right was—might! Right is a function of might. Here we have our scale: on the one side an ounce, on the other a ton. On one side “I,” on the other “we,” the United State. Is it not clear? To assume that I may have any “right” as far as the State is concerned, is like assuming that an ounce may equilibrate a ton in a scale! Hence the natural distribution: tons—rights, grams—duties. And the natural road from nothingness to greatness, is to forget that one is a gram and to feel that one is one-millionth of a ton!","Well, then, suppose a drop of acid is applied to the idea of ""rights. "" Even among the ancients, the most mature among them knew that the source of right is might, that right is a function of power. And so, we have the scales: on one side, a grain, on the other a ton; on one side ""I,"" on the other ""We,"" the One State. Is it not clear, then, that to assume that the ""I"" can have some ""rights"" in relation to the State is exactly like assuming that a gram can balance the scale against the ton? Hence, the division: rights to the ton, duties to the gram. And the natural path from nonentity to greatness is to forget that you are a gram and feel yourself instead a millionth of a ton.","So, take the idea of “rights” and drip some acid on it. Even the most adult of the Ancients knew: the source of a right is power, a right is a function of power. Take two trays of a weighing scale: put a gram on one, and on the other, put a ton. On one side is the “I,” on the other is the “WE,” the One State. Isn’t it clear? Assuming that “I” has the same “rights” compared to the State is exactly the same thing as assuming that a gram can counterbalance a ton. Here is the distribution: a ton has rights, a gram has duties. And this is the natural path from insignificance to greatness: forget that you are a gram, and feel as though you are a millionth part of the ton …","Look here—suppose you let a drop fall on the idea of “rights. ” Even among the ancients the more grown-up knew that the source of right is power, that right is a function of power. So, take some scales and put on one side a gram, on the other a ton; on one side “I” and on the other “We,” OneState. It’s clear, isn’t it?—to assert that “I” has certain “rights” with respect to the State is exactly the same as asserting that a gram weighs the same as a ton. That explains the way things are divided up: To the ton go the rights, to the gram the duties. And the natural path from nullity to greatness is this: Forget that you’re a gram and feel yourself a millionth part of a ton.","Now if we put a drop of acid on the idea of “right” … Even the ancients (the most mature of them) knew that the source of right was—might!

"То же самое – да, именно то же самое – сегодня со мной. Я знаю, что эта маленькая черная стрелка на часах сползет вот сюда, вниз, к полночи, снова медленно подымется наверх, перешагнет какую-то последнюю черту – и настанет невероятное завтра. Я знаю это, но вот все же как-то не верю – или, может быть, мне кажется, что двадцать четыре часа – это двадцать четыре года. И оттого я могу еще что-то делать, куда-то торопиться, отвечать на вопросы, взбираться по трапу вверх на «Интеграл». Я чувствую еще, как он покачивается на воде, и понимаю – что надо ухватиться за поручень – и под рукою холодное стекло. Я вижу, как прозрачные живые краны, согнув журавлиные шеи, вытянув клювы, заботливо и нежно кормят «Интеграл» страшной взрывной пищей для двигателей. И внизу на реке – я вижу ясно синие, вздувшиеся от ветра водяные жилы, узлы. Но так: все это очень отдельно от меня, посторонне, плоско – как чертеж на листе бумаги. И странно, что плоское, чертежное лицо Второго Строителя – вдруг говорит:","The same thing - yes, exactly the same thing - with me today. I know that this little black hand on the clock will slide down here at midnight, slowly rise up again, cross some last line - and an incredible tomorrow will come. I know this, but somehow I still don't believe it - or maybe it seems to me that twenty-four hours is twenty-four years. And that's why I can still do something, rush somewhere, answer questions, climb the ladder up to the Integral. I still feel how he is swaying on the water, and I understand that I need to grab onto the handrail - and cold glass is at hand. I see how transparent living cranes, bending their crane necks, stretching out their beaks, carefully and gently feed the Integral with terrible explosive food for engines. And down on the river - I clearly see blue water veins, knots swollen from the wind. But this way: all this is very separate from me, extraneous, flat - like a drawing on a sheet of paper. And it is strange that the flat, drawing-like face of the Second Builder suddenly says:","This very thing, yes , exactly this is alive in me today. I know that that small black hand on the clock will slide down here towards midnight, then again it will start to ascend, and it will cross some last border and the improbable tomorrow will have arrived. I know it, but somehow I do not believe it, or perhaps I think that twenty-four hours are twenty-four years. Therefore I am still able to act, to hurry, to answer questions, to climb the rope-ladder to the Integral. I am still able to feel how the latter is shaking the surface of the water, and I still understand that I must grasp the railing, and I am still able to feel the cold glass in my hand. I see the transparent, living cranes, bending their long necks, carefully feeding the Integral with the terrible explosive food which the motors need. I still see below on the river the blue veins and knots of water swollen by the wind.... Yet all this seems very distant from me, foreign, flat,—like a draught on a sheet of paper. And it seems to me strange, when the flat, draught-like face of the Second Builder, suddenly asks:","The same—yes, exactly the same—is true of me today. I know that this little black arrow on the dock will crawl down here, below, to midnight, will slowly rise again, will step across some final line—and the incredible tomorrow will be here. I know this, but somehow I also don't believe it. Or, perhaps, it seems to me that twenty-four hours are twenty-four years. And this is why I can still do something, hurry somewhere, answer questions, climb the ladder to the Integral. I still feel it rocking on the water; I know I must grasp the handrail and feel the cold glass under my hand. I see the transparent, living cranes bend their long, birdlike necks, stretch their beaks, and tenderly, solicitously feed the Integral with the terrible explosive food for its motors. And below, on the river, I clearly see the blue, watery veins and nodes, swollen with the wind. But all of this is quite apart from me, extraneous, flat—like a scheme on a sheet of paper. And it is strange that the flat, paper face of the Second Builder is suddenly speaking.","That’s just what—yes, that is just exactly what I am going through today. I know that the small, black arrow down there on my timepiece is crawling toward midnight and that it will rise upwards again to cross some final line and then that improbable day will begin. I know this, but I still somehow don’t believe it—or, maybe it’s just that these twenty-four hours are passing like twenty-four years. And that is why I can still do things, rush to things, answer questions, and climb up the gangway to the Integral. I can still feel it rock slightly on the water, and I can understand that you have to hold on to the handrail (the glass is cold under your hand). I see the transparent, living cranes bending their swanlike necks, stretching out their beaks, thoughtfully and tenderly feeding the Integral with scary explosive food for its engine. And I can see clearly the blue, wind-swollen water veins and knots in the river below. But meanwhile: all this was very separate from me—it was foreign and flat, like a diagram on a leaf of paper. And strangely, the flat diagram of the face of the Second Builder suddenly speaks to me: “","It’s the same—yes, exactly the same—with me today. I know that this little black hand on my watch is going to creep down to here, midnight, and that it will then climb slowly back upward, to cross at a certain moment some final point, at which time an incredible tomorrow will commence. This I know, but I somehow do not believe it—or maybe it seems to me that the twenty-four hours are going to be twenty-four years. And that is why I can still do something, hurry somewhere, answer questions, climb up the ladder to the INTEGRAL. I still feel it rocking on the water and understand that I have to hold on to the handrail and that it’s cold glass I feel under my hand. I see the transparent living cranes bending their goose necks, sticking out their beaks, and carefully, tenderly feeding the INTEGRAL the terrible explosive food for its engines. And, down below on the river, I have a clear view of the blue watery veins and nodules inflated by the wind. But even so, all this is very separate from me, strange, flat—like a diagram on a sheet of paper. And it’s also strange that the flat diagrammatic face of the Second Builder is suddenly talking: “So what do you say?","This very thing, yes , exactly this is alive in me today.

"Но не ясно ли: блаженство и зависть – это числитель и знаменатель дроби, именуемой счастьем. И какой был бы смысл во всех бесчисленных жертвах Двухсотлетней Войны, если бы в нашей жизни все-таки еще оставался повод для зависти.

"Все глаза были подняты туда, вверх: в утренней, непорочной, еще не высохшей от ночных слез синеве – едва заметное пятно, то темное, то одетое лучами. Это с небес нисходил к нам Он – новый Иегова на аэро, такой же мудрый и любяще-жестокий, как Иегова древних. С каждой минутой Он все ближе – и все выше навстречу ему миллионы сердец, – и вот уже Он видит нас. И я вместе с ним мысленно озираю сверху: намеченные тонким голубым пунктиром концентрические круги трибун – как бы круги паутины, осыпанные микроскопическими солнцами (сияние блях); и в центре ее – сейчас сядет белый, мудрый Паук – в белых одеждах Благодетель, мудро связавший нас по рукам и ногам благодетельными тенетами счастья.","All eyes were raised there, up: in the morning, immaculate blue, not yet dried from night tears - a barely noticeable spot, now dark, now dressed in rays. It was from heaven that He descended to us - the new Jehovah on an aero, just as wise and lovingly cruel as the Jehovah of the ancients. With every minute He is getting closer – and millions of hearts are meeting Him higher – and now He sees us. And together with him I mentally look from above: the concentric circles of the stands outlined by a thin blue dotted line are, as it were, circles of a cobweb, showered with microscopic suns (shine of plaques); and in the center of it - a white, wise Spider will now sit - in white robes the Benefactor, who wisely bound us hand and foot with beneficent snares of happiness.","All eyes were directed upward; in the pure morning blue, still moist with the tears of night, a small dark spot appeared.

Nearer and nearer, and higher toward him were drawn millions of hearts. Already he saw us. And in my mind with Him I looked over everything from the heights: concentric circles of stands marked with dotted blue lines of unifs,—like circles of a spider-web strewn with microscopic suns (the shining of the badges).

"S оборотился, быстро-быстро буравчики в меня, на дно, что-то достал оттуда. Потом поднял вверх левую бровь, бровью подмигнул на стену, где висело «Мефи». И мне мелькнул хвостик его улыбки – к моему удивлению, как будто даже веселой. А впрочем, чего же удивляться. Томительной, медленно подымающейся температуре инкубационного периода врач всегда предпочтет сыпь и сорокаградусный жар: тут уж, по крайней мере, ясно, что за болезнь. «Мефи», высыпавшее сегодня на стенах, – это сыпь.

But then again, what’s there to be surprised about anymore? Given the choice of the agonizingly slow-rising temperature of the incubation of an illness or a rash with a 104-degree fever, a doctor will always prefer the latter: at least the illness is clearly present. The “MEPHI,” which broke out on the wall today, is a rash. I can understand this smile …5","S turned around and quick as a flash his drills sank right down to the bottom of me, where they picked something up.

A doctor always prefers a temperature of 40°C. and a rash to the slow, languid rise of the temperature during the incubation period of a disease; it enables him to determine the character of the disease. Today “Mephi” broke out on the walls like a rash. I understood his smile. In the passage to the underground railway, under our feet on the clean glass of the steps, again a white sheet: “Mephi.”"

"Судя по дошедшим до нас описаниям, нечто подобное испытывали древние во время своих «богослужений».

"И дальше сам с собою: почему красиво? Почему танец красив? Ответ: потому что это несвободное движение, потому что весь глубокий смысл танца именно в абсолютной, эстетической подчиненности, идеальной несвободе. И если верно, что наши предки отдавались танцу в самые вдохновенные моменты своей жизни (религиозные мистерии, военные парады), то это значит только одно: инстинкт несвободы издревле органически присущ человеку, и мы в теперешней нашей жизни – только сознательно…","And further with himself: why is it beautiful?

"Говорят, древние производили выборы как-то тайно, скрываясь, как воры; некоторые наши историки утверждают даже, что они являлись на выборные празднества тщательно замаскированными (воображаю это фантастически-мрачное зрелище: ночь, площадь, крадущиеся вдоль стен фигуры в темных плащах; приседающее от ветра багровое пламя факелов…). Зачем нужна была вся эта таинственность – до сих пор не выяснено окончательно; вероятней всего, выборы связывались с какими-нибудь мистическими, суеверными, может быть, даже преступными обрядами.

"Вот этого я никак не могу осмыслить. Ведь как бы ни был ограничен их разум, но все-таки должны же они были понимать, что такая жизнь была самым настоящим поголовным убийством – только медленным, изо дня в день. Государство (гуманность) запрещало убить насмерть одного и не запрещало убивать миллионы наполовину. Убить одного, то есть уменьшить сумму человеческих жизней на 50 лет, – это преступно, а уменьшить сумму человеческих жизней на 50 миллионов лет – это не преступно. Ну, разве не смешно? У нас эту математически-моральную задачу в полминуты решит любой десятилетний нумер; у них не могли – все их Канты вместе (потому что ни один из Кантов не догадался построить систему научной этики, то есть основанной на вычитании, сложении, делении, умножении).","This is what I can't figure out. After all, no matter how limited their minds, they still had to understand that such a life was a real massacre - only slowly, day after day. The state (humanity) forbade killing one to death and did not forbid killing millions by half. To kill one, that is, to reduce the sum of human lives by 50 years, is criminal, but to reduce the sum of human lives by 50 million years is not criminal. Well, isn't it funny? With us, this mathematical-moral problem can be solved in half a minute by any ten-year-old number; they could not - all their Kants together (because none of the Kants guessed to build a system of scientific ethics, that is, based on subtraction, addition, division, multiplication).","That I cannot understand; true, their minds were rather limited in those days. Yet they should have understood, should they not, that such a life was actually wholesale murder, although slow murder, day after day? The State (humanitarianism) forbade in those days the murder of one person, but it did not forbid the killing of millions slowly and by half. To kill one, that is, to reduce the general sum of human life by fifty years, was considered criminal, but to reduce the general sum of human life by fifty million years was not considered criminal! Is it not droll? Today this simple mathematical moral problem could easily be solved in half a minute’s time by any ten-year-old Number, yet they couldn’t do it! All their Immanuel Kants together couldn’t do it! It didn’t enter the heads of all their Kants to build a system of scientific ethics, that is, ethics based on adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing.","Try as I may, I cannot understand it. After all, no matter how limited their intelligence, they should have understood that such a way of life was truly mass murder—even if slow murder. The state (humaneness) forbade the killing of a single individual, but not the partial killing of millions day by day. To kill one individual, that is, to diminish the total sum of human lives by fifty years, was criminal. But to diminish the sum of human lives by fifty million years was not considered criminal. Isn't that absurd? Today, any ten-year-old will solve this mathematical-moral problem in half a minute. They, with all their Kants taken together, could not solve it (because it never occurred to any of the Kants to build a system of scientific ethics, i.e., ethics based on subtraction, addition, division, and multiplication).","This I just cannot comprehend in any way. Their faculties of reason may not have been developed, but they must have understood more broadly that living like that amounted to mass murder— literally—only it was committed slowly, day after day. The State (humaneness) forbade killing to death any one person but didn’t forbid the half-killing of millions. To kill a man, that is, to decrease the sum of a human life span by fifty years—this was criminal. But decreasing the sum of many humans’ lives by fifty million years— this was not criminal. Isn’t that funny? This mathematical-moral mystery could be solved in half a minute by any ten-year-old cipher here among us; but they couldn’t do it—not with all their Kants put together (because not one of their Kants ever figured out how to build a system of scientific ethics based on subtraction, addition, division, and multiplication).","Now, that’s something I simply cannot get through my head. No matter how limited their powers of reason might have been, still they must have understood that living like that was just murder, a capital crime—except it was slow, day-by-day murder. The government (or humanity) would not permit capital punishment for one man, but they permitted the murder of millions a little at a time. To kill one man—that is, to subtract 50 years from the sum of all human lives—that was a crime; but to subtract from the sum of all human lives 50,000,000 years—that was not a crime! No, really, isn’t that funny? This problem in moral math could be solved in half a minute by any ten-year-old Number today, but they couldn’t solve it. All their Kants together couldn’t solve it (because it never occurred to one of their Kants to construct a system of scientific ethics—that is, one based on subtraction, addition, division, and multiplication).","That I cannot understand. True, their minds were rather limited in those days. Yet they should have understood, should they not, that such a life was actually wholesale murder, although slow murder, day after day?

To kill one person, that is, to reduce the individual span of human life by fifty years, was considered criminal, but to reduce the general sum of human life by fifty million years was not considered criminal!

"Слава Благодетелю: еще двадцать минут!

"Странно: барометр идет вниз, а ветра все еще нет, тишина. Там, наверху, уже началось – еще неслышная нам – буря. Во весь дух несутся тучи. Их пока мало – отдельные зубчатые обломки. И так: будто наверху уже низринут какой-то город, и летят вниз куски стен и башен, растут на глазах с ужасающей быстротой – все ближе, – но еще дни им лететь сквозь голубую бесконечность, пока не рухнут на дно, к нам, вниз.","Strange: the barometer is going down, but there is still no wind, silence. Up there, a storm has already begun - still inaudible to us -. Clouds are rushing in full swing. There are still few of them - separate jagged fragments. And so: it’s as if some city has already been thrown down above, and pieces of walls and towers are flying down, growing before our eyes with terrifying speed - getting closer, - but there are still days for them to fly through the blue infinity, until they collapse to the bottom, to us, down .","It is strange: the barometer continues to fall yet there is no wind. There is quiet. Above, the storm which we do not yet hear has begun. The clouds are rushing with a terrific speed. There are few of them as yet; separate fragments; it is as if there above us an unknown city were being destroyed and pieces of walls and towers were rushing down, coming nearer and nearer with terrific speed, but it will take some days of rushing through the blue infinite before they reach the bottom, that is us, below.","Strange: the barometer is falling, but there is still no wind.
