"Я затворил за собою дверь моей комнаты, засветил свечку и бросился на постель; только сон на этот раз заставил себя ждать более обыкновенного. Уж восток начинал бледнеть, когда я заснул, но – видно, было написано на небесах, что в эту ночь я не высплюсь. В четыре часа утра два кулака застучали ко мне в окно. Я вскочил: что такое?.. «Вставай, одевайся!» – кричало мне несколько голосов. Я наскоро оделся и вышел. «Знаешь, что случилось?» – сказали мне в один голос три офицера, пришедшие за мною; они были бледны как смерть.","I closed the door of my room behind me, lit the candle, and flung myself on the bed; only the dream this time forced itself to wait for something more ordinary. The east was already beginning to turn pale when I fell asleep, but apparently it was written in heaven that I would not sleep that night. At four o'clock in the morning two fists pounded on my window. I jumped up: what is it? .. ""Get up, get dressed!"" several voices shouted at me. I quickly got dressed and went out.

"За полчаса до бала явился ко мне Грушницкий полном сиянии армейского пехотного мундира. К третьей пуговице пристегнута была бронзовая цепочка, на которой висел двойной лорнет; эполеты неимоверной величины были загнуты кверху в виде крылышек амура; сапоги его скрипели; в левой руке держал он коричневые лайковые перчатки и фуражку, а правою взбивал ежеминутно в мелкие кудри завитой хохол. Самодовольствие и вместе некоторая неуверенность изображались на его лице; его праздничная наружность, его гордая походка заставили бы меня расхохотаться, если б это было согласно с моими намерениями.","Half an hour before the ball, Grushnitsky appeared to me in the full radiance of an army infantry uniform. Attached to the third button was a bronze chain from which hung a double lorgnette; epaulettes of incredible size were bent upwards in the form of cupid's wings; his boots creaked; in his left hand he held brown kid gloves and a cap, and with his right hand he constantly fluffed a curled tuft of hair into small curls.

"И точно, она была хороша: высокая, тоненькая, глаза черные, как у горной серны, так и заглядывали нам в душу. Печорин в задумчивости не сводил с нее глаз, и она частенько исподлобья на него посматривала. Только не один Печорин любовался хорошенькой княжной: из угла комнаты на нее смотрели другие два глаза, неподвижные, огненные. Я стал вглядываться и узнал моего старого знакомца Казбича. Он, знаете, был не то, чтоб мирной, не то, чтоб немирной. Подозрений на него было много, хоть он ни в какой шалости не был замечен. Бывало, он приводил к нам в крепость баранов и продавал дешево, только никогда не торговался: что запросит, давай, – хоть зарежь, не уступит. Говорили про него, что он любит таскаться на Кубань с абреками, и, правду сказать, рожа у него была самая разбойничья: маленький, сухой, широкоплечий… А уж ловок-то, ловок-то был, как бес! Бешмет всегда изорванный, в заплатках, а оружие в серебре. А лошадь его славилась в целой Кабарде, – и точно, лучше этой лошади ничего выдумать невозможно. Недаром ему завидовали все наездники и не раз пытались ее украсть, только не удавалось. Как теперь гляжу на эту лошадь: вороная, как смоль, ноги – струнки, и глаза не хуже, чем у Бэлы; а какая сила! скачи хоть на пятьдесят верст; а уж выезжена – как собака бегает за хозяином, голос даже его знала! Бывало, он ее никогда и не привязывает. Уж такая разбойничья лошадь!..","And sure enough, she was pretty: tall, thin, her eyes black, like those of a mountain chamois, looked into our souls. Pechorin did not take his eyes off her in thought, and she often looked at him from under her brows. Only Pechorin was not alone in admiring the pretty princess: from the corner of the room two other eyes, motionless, fiery, looked at her. I began to peer and recognized my old acquaintance Kazbich. He, you know, was not that peaceful, not that peaceful. There were many suspicions of him, although he was not seen in any pranks. He used to bring rams to our fortress and sell them cheaply, but he never bargained: whatever he asks, come on, even slaughter, he won’t give in. They said about him that he likes to go to the Kuban with abreks, and, to tell the truth, his face was the most robber-like: small, dry, broad-shouldered ... And he was dexterous, dexterous, like a devil! The beshmet is always torn, in patches, and the weapon is in silver. And his horse was famous in the whole Kabarda - and for sure, it is impossible to invent anything better than this horse. No wonder all the riders envied him and tried to steal it more than once, but failed. How I look at this horse now: black as pitch, legs - strings, and eyes no worse than Bela's; what a power! jump at least fifty miles; and already left - like a dog running after the owner, the voice even knew him! Sometimes he never ties her up. What a rogue horse!","“And indeed, she was fine: tall, slim, with black eyes like a hill chamois14 that cast a look straight into your soul. Pechorin, in his reverie, didn’t take his eyes off her, and she looked over at him from under her brow fairly often too. But it wasn’t only Pechorin who admired the winning princess: from the corner of the room two other eyes were looking at her, fixed and fiery. I looked over and recognized my old acquaintance Kazbich. He was, you understand, neither peaceable nor unpeaceable as it were. There were lots of suspicions about him, even though he wasn’t ever discovered making even one bit of mischief. Sometimes, he would bring sheep to us at the fortress, and he sold them cheaply —he never haggled. You would give what he asked—come what may, he wouldn’t bend. They say that he loves to roam along the Kuban River with the abreks,15 and to tell the truth, he had a thievish snout on him. He was small, spindly, wide-shouldered . . . And then his cunning—he was as cunning as a demon! His beshmet16 was always in tatters and patches, but his weapon was in silver. And his horse was famous in the whole Kabarde— you couldn’t even dream of a better horse. Not for nothing that all the horsemen envied him—and they tried to steal him more than once but never managed it. I can see that horse even now: black as jet, legs like bow-strings, and eyes no worse than Bela’s—and what strength! He’ll gallop at least 50 versts—and he’s well-trained too—runs like a dog after his master, and knows the man’s voice even! They say that Kazbich never ties him up. What a perfect horse for a thief!","“And indeed, she was beautiful: tall, slender, with black eyes which resembled those of a mountain gazelle and practically peered into your soul. Lost in thought, Pechorin did not take his eyes off her, and quite often she would steal a glance at him from under her brows. But Pechorin was not the only one to admire the pretty young princess: from a corner of the room, there looked at her another pair of eyes, immobile and fiery. I looked closer, and recognized my old acquaintance, Kazbich. He was, do you know, neither exactly neutral, nor exactly hostile. He was suspected of many things, though he had never been involved in any mischief. At times, he would bring sheep19 to our fort and sell them cheap, but he would never haggle: whatever his asking price was, you had to pay it —you could cut his throat and still he would not come down. It was rumored of him that he liked to prowl on the Russian side of the Kuban River20 with abreks.21 And to tell the truth , his countenance was that of a regular robber: he was small, wiry, broad-shouldered … And how nimble he was; it was the nimbleness of a devil! His beshmet22 was always in tatters, all patched up, but his weapons were chased with silver. And his horse was the talk of the whole Kabardan region—indeed, you could not think of anything more handsome than that horse. No wonder, every horseman envied him; and there had been more than one attempt to steal it, but none succeeded. It is as if I were looking at that horse now: pitch black, legs like taut strings, and eyes no less beautiful than Bela’s; and what strength!—you could ride him thirty miles; and how well he was trained—ran after his master like a dog; even knew his voice! As a matter of fact, Kazbich would never tie him. Just the right horse for a bandit!"

"Его наружность была из тех, которые с первого взгляда поражают неприятно, но которые нравятся впоследствии, когда глаз выучится читать в неправильных чертах отпечаток души испытанной и высокой. Бывали примеры, что женщины влюблялись в таких людей до безумия и не променяли бы их безобразия на красоту самых свежих и розовых эндимионов; надобно отдать справедливость женщинам: они имеют инстинкт красоты душевной: оттого-то, может быть, люди, подобные Вернеру, так страстно любят женщин.","His appearance was one of those that strike unpleasantly at first sight, but which one likes later, when the eye has learned to read in irregular features the imprint of a tried and exalted soul. There were examples that women fell in love with such people to the point of madness and would not exchange their ugliness for the beauty of the freshest and pinkest endymons; it is necessary to do justice to women: they have an instinct for the beauty of their souls: that is why, perhaps, people like Werner love women so passionately.","His appearance was one that strikes you, on first glance, as unpleasant but which subsequently becomes likable, when the eye has learned to read the stamp of an experienced and lofty soul in his irregular features.

"Итак, я начал рассматривать лицо слепого; но что прикажете прочитать на лице, у которого нет глаз? Долго я глядел на него с небольшим сожалением, как вдруг едва приметная улыбка пробежала по тонким губам его, и, не знаю отчего, она произвела на меня самое неприятное впечатление.

"Так прошло около часа. Месяц светил в окно, и луч его играл по земляному полу хаты. Вдруг на яркой полосе, пересекающей пол, промелькнула тень. Я привстал и взглянул в окно: кто-то вторично пробежал мимо его и скрылся Бог знает куда. Я не мог полагать, чтоб это существо сбежало по отвесу берега; однако иначе ему некуда было деваться. Я встал, накинул бешмет, опоясал кинжал и тихо-тихо вышел из хаты; навстречу мне слепой мальчик. Я притаился у забора, и он верной, но осторожной поступью прошел мимо меня. Под мышкой он нес какой-то узел, и повернув к пристани, стал спускаться по узкой и крутой тропинке. «В тот день немые возопиют и слепые прозрят», – подумал я, следуя за ним в таком расстоянии, чтоб не терять его из вида.","So it took about an hour. The moon shone through the window, and its beam played on the earthen floor of the hut. Suddenly, a shadow flashed across the bright strip that crossed the floor.

I could not believe that this creature had escaped along the steep bank; however, he had nowhere else to go. I got up, put on my beshmet, girded my dagger, and quietly left the hut; towards me a blind boy. I crouched near the fence, and with a sure but cautious step he passed me. Under his arm, he carried some kind of bundle, and turning towards the pier, he began to descend along a narrow and steep path. “On that day the dumb will cry out and the blind will see,” I thought, following him at such a distance so as not to lose sight of him.","Thus an hour passed. The moon shone through the window, and its light played on the earthen floor of the peasant house. Suddenly, a shadow flew through a bright ray that cut across the floor.

I could not suppose that this creature had run down the steep slope of the shore; however, there was no other place for it to have gone.

"Сегодняшний вечер был обилен происшествиями.

Я взял под уздцы лошадь княжны и свел ее в воду, которая не была выше колен; мы тихонько стали подвигаться наискось против течения.

I took the princess's horse by the bridle and led it into the water, which was not above the knees; we slowly began to move obliquely against the current.

I was riding by the young princess’s side: on our way home, the Podkumok River had to be forded. The shallowest mountain streams are dangerous, especially because their bottom is an absolute kaleidoscope: every day it changes from the pressure of the waves. Where yesterday there was a stone, today there is a hole. I took the princess’s horse by the bridle and led it down into the water, which was no more than knee-deep: we started to advance slowly in an oblique direction against the current. It is well-known that when fording rapid streams, one should not look at the water, for otherwise one immediately gets dizzy. I forgot to warn Princess Mary of this."

"– А-га, вот что!.. – отвечал он, – да ведь они всегда были отъявленные пьяницы!","- Ah, that's what! .. - he answered, - but they were always notorious drunkards!","“Aha, that’s it!” he replied. “Indeed, they have always been inveterate drunks!”","“Ah, that’s how it is!” he answered. “Well, they have always been inveterate drunkards!”"
– А что ж?,- What about it?,“Well . . . what?”,“Well—why?”
"Крепость наша стояла на высоком месте, и вид был с вала прекрасный; с одной стороны широкая поляна, изрытая несколькими балками[9], оканчивалась лесом, который тянулся до самого хребта гор; кое-где на ней дымились аулы, ходили табуны; с другой – бежала мелкая речка, и к ней примыкал частый кустарник, покрывавший кремнистые возвышенности, которые соединялись с главной цепью Кавказа. Мы сидели на углу бастиона, так что в обе стороны могли видеть все. Вот смотрю: из леса выезжает кто-то на серой лошади, все ближе и ближе и, наконец, остановился по ту сторону речки, саженях во сте от нас, и начал кружить лошадь свою как бешеный. Что за притча!..","Our fortress stood on a high place, and the view from the rampart was beautiful; on one side, a wide clearing, pitted with several beams[9], ended in a forest that stretched to the very ridge of the mountains; in some places auls smoked on it, herds walked; on the other, a small river ran, and a dense shrubbery adjoined it, covering the siliceous hills, which connected with the main chain of the Caucasus. We sat on the corner of the bastion, so that everyone could see in both directions. Here I look: someone is riding out of the forest on a gray horse, getting closer and closer, and finally, he stopped on the other side of the river, a hundred fathoms from us, and began to circle his horse like a mad one. What a parable!","“Our fortress stood at a high point, and the view from the ramparts was excellent. On one side, there was a wide glade, pitted with several gullies, finishing at a forest that stretched to the peak of the mountain. Here and there, auls were sending up smoke, herds were ranging. A rivulet ran on the other side, flanked by the thick shrubbery, which covered the stony ridges connecting to the central chain of the Caucasus. We sat on the corner of a bastion, so we could see everything on either side. And then I saw: someone emerging from the forest on a gray horse, getting closer and closer, and finally stopping on the other side of the stream, about a hundred sazhens33 from us, and twirling his horse, like a madman. What an extraordinary thing!","“Our fort stood on high ground, and the view from the rampart was beautiful: on one side, an extensive meadow,45 furrowed by several ravines, ended in a forest which stretched all the way up to the mountain ridge; here and there, native hamlets smoked upon it, and herds of horses ranged; on the other side, there ran a shallow river, margined by the dense brush, which covered the flinty heights, linked up with the main Caucasian range. We sat in a corner of the bastion, and thus could see everything in either direction. This is what I saw: somebody rode out of the forest on a gray horse, he came nearer and nearer, and finally, stopped on the far side of the river, some two hundred and fifty yards from us, and began wheeling his horse around like a madman. What could it mean?"
– Нет.,- Not.,“No.”,“No.”

"Она посмотрела на меня пристально, покачала головой – и опять впала в задумчивость: явно было, что ей хотелось что-то сказать, но она не знала, с чего начать; ее грудь волновалась… Как быть! кисейный рукав слабая защита, и электрическая искра пробежала из моей руки в ее руку; все почти страсти начинаются так, и мы часто себя очень обманываем, думая, что нас женщина любит за наши физические или нравственные достоинства; конечно, они приготовляют ее сердце к принятию священного огня, а все-таки первое прикосновение решает дело.","She looked at me intently, shook her head, and again fell into thoughtfulness: it was obvious that she wanted to say something, but she did not know where to begin; her chest was agitated...

"И много других подобных дум проходило в уме моем; я их не удерживал, потому что не люблю останавливаться на какой-нибудь отвлеченной мысли. И к чему это ведет?.. В первой молодости моей я был мечтателем, я любил ласкать попеременно то мрачные, то радужные образы, которые рисовало мне беспокойное и жадное воображение. Но что от этого мне осталось? одна усталость, как после ночной битвы с привидением, и смутное воспоминание, исполненное сожалений. В этой напрасной борьбе я истощил и жар души, и постоянство воли, необходимое для действительной жизни; я вступил в эту жизнь, пережив ее уже мысленно, и мне стало скучно и гадко, как тому, кто читает дурное подражание давно ему известной книге.","And many other similar thoughts passed through my mind; I didn't hold them back because I don't like dwelling on some abstract thought.

But what is left of this for me? only weariness, as after a night of fighting with a ghost, and a vague memory full of regrets. In this futile struggle, I exhausted both the heat of the soul and the constancy of the will necessary for real life; I entered this life having already experienced it mentally, and I became bored and disgusted, like someone who reads a bad imitation of a book he has long known.","Many similar such thoughts passed through my mind, and I didn’t suppress them because I don’t like to dwell on any sort of abstract thought.

But what did this leave me with? Only fatigue, like that which comes after a nocturnal battle with a specter, and dim recollections, filled with regret. In this pointless struggle I exhausted both the fire of my soul and the constancy of my will, both necessary for a real life. I then set about living this life, having survived it already in my thoughts, and I became bored and repulsed, like a man who is reading a stupid imitation of a book with which he has long been familiar.","And many other, similar, thoughts passed through my mind. I did not detain them, since I do not care to concentrate on any abstract thought; and, indeed, what does it lead to?

"Поздно вечером, то есть часов в одиннадцать, я пошел гулять по липовой аллее бульвара. Город спал, только в некоторых окнах мелькали огни. С трех сторон чернели гребни утесов, отрасли Машука, на вершине которого лежало зловещее облачко; месяц подымался на востоке; вдали серебряной бахромой сверкали снеговые горы. Оклики часовых перемежались с шумом горячих ключей, спущенных на ночь. Порою звучный топот коня раздавался по улице, сопровождаемый скрыпом нагайской арбы и заунывным татарским припевом. Я сел на скамью и задумался… Я чувствовал необходимость излить свои мысли в дружеском разговоре… но с кем? «Что делает теперь Вера?» – думал я… Я бы дорого дал, чтоб в эту минуту пожать ее руку.","Late in the evening, that is, at eleven o'clock, I went for a walk along the linden alley of the boulevard. The city was sleeping, only lights flickered in some windows. From three sides blackened the ridges of the cliffs, branches of Mashuk, on the top of which lay an ominous cloud; the moon rose in the east; in the distance the snow-capped mountains glittered like a silver fringe. The calls of sentries were interspersed with the noise of hot springs lowered for the night. Sometimes the sonorous stomp of a horse was heard along the street, accompanied by the creak of a Nagai cart and a mournful Tatar refrain. I sat down on the bench and thought... I felt the need to pour out my thoughts in friendly conversation... but with whom? ""What is Vera doing now?"" - I thought ... I would give dearly to shake her hand at that moment.","Late that evening, at eleven o’clock that is, I went out for a stroll along the linden alley of the boulevard. The city was sleeping, the lights of fires flashed in a few windows. Craggy crests loomed black on three sides: the ridges of Mount Mashuk, on whose peaks lay a sinister little cloud. The moon smoked in the east. In the distance the snowy mountains sparkled with a silver fringe. The calls of the sentries alternated with noises from the hot springs, which are released at night. From time to time, the ringing clatter of horses scattered along the street, accompanied by the creaking of a Nogay wagon,11 and doleful Tatar song. I sat on a bench and became lost in my thoughts . . . I felt the necessity to give vent to my thoughts in a conversation with a friend . . . but with whom? “What is Vera doing right now?” I thought . . .

"Оборачиваюсь: Грушницкий! Мы обнялись. Я познакомился с ним в действующем отряде. Он был ранен пулей в ногу и поехал на воды с неделю прежде меня. Грушницкий – юнкер. Он только год в службе, носит, по особенному роду франтовства, толстую солдатскую шинель. У него георгиевский солдатский крестик. Он хорошо сложен, смугл и черноволос; ему на вид можно дать двадцать пять лет, хотя ему едва ли двадцать один год. Он закидывает голову назад, когда говорит, и поминутно крутит усы левой рукой, ибо правою опирается на костыль. Говорит он скоро и вычурно: он из тех людей, которые на все случаи жизни имеют готовые пышные фразы, которых просто прекрасное не трогает и которые важно драпируются в необыкновенные чувства, возвышенные страсти и исключительные страдания. Производить эффект – их наслаждение; они нравятся романтическим провинциалкам до безумия. Под старость они делаются либо мирными помещиками, либо пьяницами – иногда тем и другим. В их душе часто много добрых свойств, но ни на грош поэзии. Грушницкого страсть была декламировать: он закидывал вас словами, как скоро разговор выходил из круга обыкновенных понятий; спорить с ним я никогда не мог. Он не отвечает на ваши возражения, он вас не слушает. Только что вы остановитесь, он начинает длинную тираду, по-видимому имеющую какую-то связь с тем, что вы сказали, но которая в самом деле есть только продолжение его собственной речи.","I turn around: Grushnitsky! We hugged. I met him in the active detachment. He was wounded by a bullet in the leg and went to the waters a week before me. Grushnitsky is a cadet. He is only a year in the service, wears, in a special kind of foppery, a thick soldier's overcoat. He has a St. George soldier's cross. He is well built, swarthy and black-haired; he looks to be twenty-five years old, although he is scarcely twenty-one. He throws his head back when he speaks, and continually twists his mustache with his left hand, for with his right he leans on a crutch. He speaks quickly and pretentiously: he is one of those people who have pompous phrases ready for all occasions, who simply do not touch the beautiful and who importantly drape themselves in extraordinary feelings, lofty passions and exceptional suffering. To produce an effect is their delight; they are liked by romantic provincial women to the point of madness. In old age, they become either peaceful landowners or drunkards - sometimes both. In their souls there are often many good qualities, but not a penny worth of poetry. Grushnitsky's passion was to recite: he bombarded you with words, as soon as the conversation left the circle of ordinary concepts; I could never argue with him. He does not answer your objections, he does not listen to you. As soon as you stop, he starts a long tirade, apparently having some connection with what you said, but which is really only a continuation of his own speech.","I turn around: Grushnitsky!

He looks as though he is twenty-five years old, but he is barely twenty-one. He throws his head back when he talks and he twists his mustache with his left hand all the time, while the right hand leans on his crutch. His speech is quick and fanciful: he is one of those people who have a flamboyant phrase ready for any situation, who aren’t touched by the simply beautiful, and who grandly drape themselves with extraordinary feelings, sublime passions and exceptional suffering. They delight in producing an effect. They are madly fancied by romantic provincial girls. Toward old age, they become either peaceful landowners, or drunks—and sometimes both. There are often many good attributes to their souls, but not a half-kopeck piece of poetry.

"– Печорин был долго нездоров, исхудал, бедняжка; только никогда с этих пор мы не говорили о Бэле: я видел, что ему будет неприятно, так зачем же? Месяца три спустя его назначили в Е…й полк, и он уехал в Грузию. Мы с тех пор не встречались, да помнится, кто-то недавно мне говорил, что он возвратился в Россию, но в приказах по корпусу не было. Впрочем, до нашего брата вести поздно доходят.","- Pechorin was unwell for a long time, emaciated, poor thing; only since then we have never talked about Bel: I saw that it would be unpleasant for him, so why? About three months later he was assigned to the E ... th regiment, and he left for Georgia.

However, news reaches our brother late.","“Pechorin was unwell for a long while, he wasted away, poor fellow, but we never spoke of Bela again.

We have not met since then … Yes, now that I think of it, someone was telling me recently that he had returned to Russia, but there was nothing about it in divisional orders.

"Когда дым рассеялся, Грушницкого на площадке не было. Только прах легким столбом еще вился на краю обрыва.","When the smoke cleared, Grushnitsky was not on the site. Only the ashes still curled on the edge of the cliff in a light column.","When the smoke had dissipated, there was no Grushnitsky on the platform. Only a light pillar of dust still curled up at the edge of the precipice.","When the smoke dispersed, Grushnitski was not on the ledge. Only dust in a light column still revolved on the brink of the precipice."
"Смотрю: Печорин на скаку приложился из ружья… «Не стреляйте! – кричу я ему. – берегите заряд; мы и так его догоним». Уж эта молодежь! вечно некстати горячится… Но выстрел раздался, и пуля перебила заднюю ногу лошади: она сгоряча сделала еще прыжков десять, споткнулась и упала на колени; Казбич соскочил, и тогда мы увидели, что он держал на руках своих женщину, окутанную чадрою… Это была Бэла… бедная Бэла! Он что-то нам закричал по-своему и занес над нею кинжал… Медлить было нечего: я выстрелил, в свою очередь, наудачу; верно, пуля попала ему в плечо, потому что вдруг он опустил руку… Когда дым рассеялся, на земле лежала раненая лошадь и возле нее Бэла; а Казбич, бросив ружье, по кустарникам, точно кошка, карабкался на утес; хотелось мне его снять оттуда – да не было заряда готового! Мы соскочили с лошадей и кинулись к Бэле. Бедняжка, она лежала неподвижно, и кровь лилась из раны ручьями… Такой злодей; хоть бы в сердце ударил – ну, так уж и быть, одним разом все бы кончил, а то в спину… самый разбойничий удар! Она была без памяти. Мы изорвали чадру и перевязали рану как можно туже; напрасно Печорин целовал ее холодные губы – ничто не могло привести ее в себя.","I look: Pechorin, at a gallop, kissed from a gun ... “Do not shoot! I shout to him. - take care of the charge; we'll catch up with him anyway."" This youth! always inappropriately excited ... But the shot rang out, and the bullet broke the horse's hind leg: in the heat of the moment she made another ten jumps, stumbled and fell to her knees; Kazbich jumped off, and then we saw that he was holding a woman wrapped in a veil in his arms ... It was Bela ... poor Bela! He shouted something to us in his own way and raised a dagger over her ... There was nothing to delay: I, in turn, fired at random; sure, the bullet hit him in the shoulder, because suddenly he lowered his hand ... When the smoke cleared, a wounded horse was lying on the ground and Bela beside it; and Kazbich, throwing down his gun, clambered through the bushes, like a cat, up a cliff; I wanted to take it off from there - but there was no charge ready! We jumped off our horses and rushed to Bela. Poor thing, she lay motionless, and blood poured from the wound in streams ... Such a villain; even if he struck in the heart - well, so be it, he would have finished everything at once, otherwise in the back ... the most robber blow! She was unconscious. We tore off the veil and bandaged the wound as tightly as possible; Pechorin kissed her cold lips in vain—nothing could bring her to her senses.","“As I watched, Pechorin took aim with his rifle at full gallop . . . ‘Don’t shoot!’ I yelled to him. ‘Hold your fire! We’ll catch up with him!’ But—young men! Forever flaring up when they shouldn’t . . . A shot rang out, and the bullet broke the horse’s back leg. It sprang along another ten times or so, compelled by the heat of the moment, then stumbled and fell to its knees. Kazbich leapt off, and then we saw that he was holding a woman covered in a yashmak in his arms . . . It was Bela . . . Poor Bela! He then shouted something in his tongue and raised his dagger over her . . . There wasn’t a moment to waste. I took a shot in turn, a random shot. It looked as though the bullet had hit him in the shoulder because his arm suddenly fell . . . But when the smoke had dispersed, the horse lay wounded on the ground, and Bela next to it. And Kazbich, having thrown his rifle into the bushes, was clambering up the cliff like a cat. I would have liked to pick him off, but I didn’t have a ready cartridge! We jumped off our horses and rushed to Bela. The poor thing, she was lying there, unmoving, and blood was pouring in streams from her wound. That scoundrel—he could have at least struck her in the heart and ended it all with one blow, but to stick her in the back . . . the most treacherous of attacks! She wasn’t conscious. We tore up the yashmak and bandaged the wound as tightly as we could. Pechorin kissed her cold lips, but to no avail—nothing could bring her to her senses.","“I looked and saw Pechorin take aim at full gallop. Don’t fire!’ I cried to him. ‘ Save your shot, we’ll catch up with him anyway.’ But those youngsters, they always lose their heads at the wrong time. The shot rang out and the bullet broke the hind leg of Kazbich’s horse: carried on by impetus , it took another ten bounds or so, then stumbled and fell to its knees. Kazbich jumped off, and then we saw that he was holding in his arms a woman wrapped up in a yashmak. It was Bela, poor Bela! He shouted something at us in his own tongue, and raised his dagger over her. No time could be lost; I fired in my turn, at random; the bullet must have hit him in the shoulder because he suddenly lowered his arm. When the smoke had cleared, the wounded horse lay on the ground, and beside it lay Bela, while Kazbich, having abandoned his rifle, was scrambling like a cat up the scrub on the cliff. I would have liked to bring him down, but I had no charge ready. We jumped off our horses and rushed toward Bela. Poor little thing, she was lying motionless, and blood poured out of her wound in streams. What a villain! He could at least have hit her in the heart—then after all, it would have been over with one blow, but in the back, the most treacherous stab! She was unconscious. We tore up the veil and bound up the wound as tight as we could. In vain did Pechorin kiss her cold lips—nothing could restore her to consciousness."
"В этот вечер Казбич был угрюмее, чем когда-нибудь, и я заметил, что у него под бешметом надета кольчуга. «Недаром на нем эта кольчуга, – подумал я, – уж он, верно, что-нибудь замышляет».","That evening Kazbich was gloomier than ever, and I noticed that he was wearing chain mail under his beshmet. “It’s not for nothing that he is wearing this chain mail,” I thought, “he must be plotting something.”","“That evening, Kazbich was as sullen as ever, and I noticed that he had a chain mail shirt under his beshmet. ‘ He’s wearing this chain mail shirt for a reason,’ I thought. ‘He has probably laid a plan.’","“That night Kazbich was gloomier than ever, and I noticed that under his beshmet he wore a coat of mail. ‘It is not without reason that he has that coat of mail on,’ I reflected. ‘ He must be planning something.’23"
"Вот раз уговаривает меня Печорин ехать с ним на кабана; я долго отнекивался: ну, что мне был за диковинка кабан! Однако ж утащил-таки он меня с собой. Мы взяли человек пять солдат и уехали рано утром. До десяти часов шныряли по камышам и по лесу, – нет зверя. «Эй, не воротиться ли? – говорил я, – к чему упрямиться? Уж, видно, такой задался несчастный день!» Только Григорий Александрович, несмотря на зной и усталость, не хотел воротиться без добычи, таков уж был человек: что задумает, подавай; видно, в детстве был маменькой избалован… Наконец в полдень отыскали проклятого кабана: паф! паф!.. не тут-то было: ушел в камыши… такой уж был несчастный день! Вот мы, отдохнув маленько, отправились домой.","Once Pechorin persuades me to go with him to the boar; I denied for a long time: well, what a curiosity a wild boar was to me! However, he took me with him. We took about five soldiers and left early in the morning. Until ten o'clock they darted through the reeds and through the forest - there was no beast. ""Hey, why don't you come back? - I said, - why be stubborn? It must have been such an unfortunate day!” Only Grigory Alexandrovich, despite the heat and fatigue, did not want to return without prey, such was the man: whatever he thinks, give; apparently, in childhood he was spoiled by his mother ... Finally, at noon, they found the damned boar: bang! bang! .. it wasn’t there: he went into the reeds ... it was such an unhappy day! Here we are, resting a little, went home.","“One day, Pechorin had tried to persuade me to go boar-hunting with him. I refused at length. Wild boar was no marvel to me! But, he managed to drag me off with him anyway. We took about five soldiers and set off early in the morning. Until ten o’clock we darted about the rushes and forest without seeing one beast. “‘Ho! Shouldn’t we go back?’ I said. ‘What is there to aim at? It’s clear that it’s turned out to be an unlucky day!’ But Grigory Alexandrovich did not want to turn back without some sort of quarry, never mind the intense heat and exhaustion . . . that’s the kind of person he was—as soon as something occurs to him, he has to have it. He must have been spoiled by his mama as a child . . . Finally, at midday, we tracked down a damned boar. Paff! Paff! . . . No luck. It fled into the rushes. That’s the sort of unlucky day it was! . . . Then we paused to catch our breath for a moment, and set off home.","“Well, one day, Pechorin began persuading me to go boar-hunting with him; for a long time I kept refusing: after all, a wild boar was no novelty to me; nevertheless he did succeed in dragging me off with him. We took half a dozen soldiers with us and left early in the morning. Until ten o’clock we poked around in the rushes and in the woods, but found not one brute. ‘Hey, how about turning back?” I said. “What’s the point in persisting? It is obviously our unlucky day!’ But Pechorin, despite the heat and fatigue, did not want to return without a kill. That’s the kind of man he was: whatever he set his heart on he had to have, you could see he had been spoiled by his mamma when he was young. At last, at noontime, we tracked down that damned boar. Bang, bang! went our guns, but it was not to be, the boar escaped into the rushes. It was that kind of unlucky day! Well, we rested for a little while and set out for home."
"Когда она от нас отошла, тогда я шепнул Григорью Александровичу: «Ну что, какова?» – «Прелесть! – отвечал он. – А как ее зовут?» – «Ее зовут Бэлою», – отвечал я.","When she left us, then I whispered to Grigory Alexandrovich: “Well, what is it like?” – “Lovely! he answered. - What is her name?"" “Her name is Beloyu,” I replied.","“When she walked away from us, I whispered to Grigory Alexandrovich: “ ‘Well, what do you think of her?’ “ ‘Enchanting!’ he replied. ‘What is her name?’ “ ‘Her name is Bela,’ I replied.","“When she had moved away from us, I whispered to Pechorin: “Well, what do you think of her?” “‘Charming,’ he answered. “What is her name?” “Her name is Bela,’ I replied."
"Велев седлать лошадей, я оделся и сбежал к купальне. Погружаясь в холодный кипяток нарзана, я чувствовал, как телесные и душевные силы мои возвращались.

"– Да, я уж здесь служил при Алексее Петровиче[1], – отвечал он, приосанившись. – Когда он приехал на Линию, я был подпоручиком, – прибавил он, – и при нем получил два чина за дела против горцев.","“Yes, I already served here under Alexei Petrovich,” he answered, drawing himself up. “When he came to the Line, I was a lieutenant,” he added, “and under him I received two ranks for deeds against the highlanders.","“I served here before under Alexei Petrovich,” he replied, assuming a dignified air. “When he arrived at the front I was a second lieutenant,” he added, “and under him I received two promotions for action against the mountain-dwellers.”","“I was already serving here in General Aleksey Ermolov’s7 time,” he replied with a certain loftiness. “When he took over the Border Command, I was a second lieutenant,” he added, “and, under him, was twice promoted for action against the mountain tribes.”"

"Пробегаю в памяти все мое прошедшее и спрашиваю себя невольно: зачем я жил? для какой цели я родился?.. А, верно, она существовала, и, верно, было мне назначение высокое, потому что я чувствую в душе моей силы необъятные… Но я не угадал этого назначения, я увлекся приманками страстей пустых и неблагодарных; из горнила их я вышел тверд и холоден, как железо, но утратил навеки пыл благородных стремлений – лучший свет жизни. И с той поры сколько раз уже я играл роль топора в руках судьбы! Как орудие казни, я упадал на голову обреченных жертв, часто без злобы, всегда без сожаления… Моя любовь никому не принесла счастья, потому что я ничем не жертвовал для тех, кого любил: я любил для себя, для собственного удовольствия: я только удовлетворял странную потребность сердца, с жадностью поглощая их чувства, их радости и страданья – и никогда не мог насытиться.

"Cегодня я встал поздно; прихожу к колодцу – никого уже нет. Становилось жарко; белые мохнатые тучки быстро бежали от снеговых гор, обещая грозу; голова Машука дымилась, как загашенный факел; кругом него вились и ползали, как змеи, серые клочки облаков, задержанные в своем стремлении и будто зацепившиеся за колючий его кустарник. Воздух был напоен электричеством. Я углубился в виноградную аллею, ведущую в грот; мне было грустно. Я думал о той молодой женщине с родинкой на щеке, про которую говорил мне доктор… Зачем она здесь? И она ли? И почему я думаю, что это она? и почему я даже так в этом уверен? Мало ли женщин с родинками на щеках? Размышляя таким образом, я подошел к самому гроту. Смотрю: в прохладной тени его свода, на каменной скамье сидит женщина, в соломенной шляпке, окутанная черной шалью, опустив голову на грудь; шляпка закрывала ее лицо. Я хотел уже вернуться, чтоб не нарушить ее мечтаний, когда она на меня взглянула.","Today I got up late; I come to the well - there is no one else. It was getting hot; white shaggy clouds quickly fled from the snowy mountains, promising a thunderstorm; Mashuk's head was smoking like an extinguished torch; around it, gray wisps of clouds curled and crawled like snakes, held back in their striving and seemed to be clinging to its thorny bush. The air was filled with electricity. I went deeper into the avenue of grapes leading to the grotto; I was sad. I thought about that young woman with a mole on her cheek that the doctor told me about... Why is she here? And is she? And why do I think it's her? And why am I even so sure of it? Are there many women with moles on their cheeks? Thinking in this way, I approached the grotto itself. I look: in the cool shade of its arch, on a stone bench, a woman is sitting, in a straw hat, wrapped in a black shawl, her head bowed to her chest; the hat covered her face. I already wanted to return, so as not to disturb her dreams, when she looked at me.","Today I was up late; I arrived at the well—and no one was there anymore. The day began to get hot. White, shaggy rain clouds quickly sped down from the snowy mountains, promising a storm. The head of Mount Mashuk was smoking like an extinguished torch. Gray shreds of cloud twisted and crawled around it, like snakes, and they seemed to be held back in their strivings, as if they had been caught up in its prickly shrubbery. The air was filled with electricity. I went deep into the grapevine alley that led to a grotto; I was melancholy. I was thinking about the young woman whom the doctor had mentioned, with the mole on her cheek . . . Why is she here? Is it she? And why do I think that it is she? And why am I even convinced of it? Are women with moles on their cheeks so very rare? Thinking in this way, I walked right up to the grotto and looked: on a stone bench in the cool shadows of its entrance, a woman was sitting, wrapped in a black shawl, wearing a straw hat, with her head lowered onto her chest. The hat covered her face. I wanted to turn, in order not to ruin her daydreaming, when she caught sight of me.","Today I rose late; when I reached the well, there was already nobody there. It was getting hot; furry white clouds were rapidly scudding from the snowy mountains with the promise of a thunderstorm; the top of Mount Mashuk smoked like an extinguished torch; around it there coiled and slithered, like snakes, gray shreds of cloud, which had been delayed in their surge and seemed to have caught in its thorny brush. The air was pervaded with electricity. I plunged into a viny avenue that led to a grotto; I was sad. I kept thinking of that young woman with the little birthmark on her cheek of whom the doctor had been talking. Why was she here? And was it she? And why did I think it was she? And why was I even so sure of it? Were there not many women with little moles on their cheeks! Meditating in this fashion, I came close to the grotto. As I looked in, I saw in the cool shade of its vault, on a stone bench, a seated woman, wearing a straw hat, a black shawl wrapped around her shoulders, her head sunken on her breast: the hat screened her face. I was on the point of turning back, so as not to disturb her revery, when she looked up at me."

"Происшествие этого вечера произвело на меня довольно глубокое впечатление и раздражило мои нервы; не знаю наверное, верю ли я теперь предопределению или нет, но в этот вечер я ему твердо верил: доказательство было разительно, и я, несмотря на то, что посмеялся над нашими предками и их услужливой астрологией, попал невольно в их колею, но я остановил себя вовремя на этом опасном пути и, имея правило ничего не отвергать решительно и ничему не вверяться слепо, отбросил метафизику в сторону и стал смотреть под ноги. Такая предосторожность была очень кстати: я чуть-чуть не упал, наткнувшись на что-то толстое и мягкое, но, по-видимому, неживое. Наклоняюсь – месяц уж светил прямо на дорогу – и что же? предо мною лежала свинья, разрубленная пополам шашкой… Едва я успел ее осмотреть, как услышал шум шагов: два казака бежали из переулка, один подошел ко мне и спросил, не видал ли я пьяного казака, который гнался за свиньей. Я объявил им, что не встречал казака, и указал на несчастную жертву его неистовой храбрости.","The incident of that evening made a rather deep impression on me and irritated my nerves; I don’t know for sure whether I now believe in predestination or not, but that evening I firmly believed it: the proof was striking, and despite the fact that I laughed at our ancestors and their helpful astrology, I involuntarily fell into their rut, but I He stopped himself in time on this dangerous path and, having the rule not to reject anything resolutely and not to trust anything blindly, he threw metaphysics aside and began to look under his feet.

And having the rule of never rejecting anything absolutely, and never believing in anything blindly, I threw out metaphysics and started to look beneath my feet. Such precaution was very apt. I nearly fell, stumbling on something fat and soft, but by all appearances, not living. I stooped—the moon was shining directly onto the road—and what was it?

"После этой трагической фразы, сказанной с приличною важностью, он отошел на свое место; Иван Игнатьич со слезами обнял также Грушницкого, и вот он остался один против меня. Я до сих пор стараюсь объяснить себе, какого роду чувство кипело тогда в груди моей: то было и досада оскорбленного самолюбия, и презрение, и злоба, рождавшаяся при мысли, что этот человек, теперь с такою уверенностью, с такой спокойной дерзостью на меня глядящий, две минуты тому назад, не подвергая себя никакой опасности, хотел меня убить как собаку, ибо раненный в ногу немного сильнее, я бы непременно свалился с утеса.","After this tragic phrase, spoken with decent gravity, he retired to his seat; Ivan Ignatich also embraced Grushnitsky with tears, and now he was left alone against me.

"Тихо было все на небе и на земле, как в сердце человека в минуту утренней молитвы; только изредка набегал прохладный ветер с востока, приподнимая гриву лошадей, покрытую инеем. Мы тронулись в путь; с трудом пять худых кляч тащили наши повозки по извилистой дороге на Гуд-гору; мы шли пешком сзади, подкладывая камни под колеса, когда лошади выбивались из сил; казалось, дорога вела на небо, потому что, сколько глаз мог разглядеть, она все поднималась и наконец пропадала в облаке, которое еще с вечера отдыхало на вершине Гуд-горы, как коршун, ожидающий добычу; снег хрустел под ногами нашими; воздух становился так редок, что было больно дышать; кровь поминутно приливала в голову, но со всем тем какое-то отрадное чувство распространялось по всем моим жилам, и мне было как-то весело, что я так высоко над миром: чувство детское, не спорю, но, удаляясь от условий общества и приближаясь к природе, мы невольно становимся детьми; все приобретенное отпадает от души, и она делается вновь такою, какой была некогда, и, верно, будет когда-нибудь опять. Тот, кому случалось, как мне, бродить по горам пустынным, и долго-долго всматриваться в их причудливые образы, и жадно глотать животворящий воздух, разлитый в их ущельях, тот, конечно, поймет мое желание передать, рассказать, нарисовать эти волшебные картины. Вот наконец мы взобрались на Гуд-гору, остановились и оглянулись: на ней висело серое облако, и его холодное дыхание грозило близкой бурею; но на востоке все было так ясно и золотисто, что мы, то есть я и штабс-капитан, совершенно о нем забыли… Да, и штабс-капитан: в сердцах простых чувство красоты и величия природы сильнее, живее во сто крат, чем в нас, восторженных рассказчиках на словах и на бумаге.","Everything was quiet in heaven and on earth, as in the heart of a person at the moment of morning prayer; only occasionally a cool wind from the east came up, lifting the horses' manes, covered with hoarfrost. We set off; with difficulty, five thin nags dragged our wagons along the winding road to Good Mountain; we walked behind, placing stones under the wheels when the horses were exhausted; it seemed that the road led to heaven, because, as far as eyes could see, it kept rising and finally disappeared in a cloud that had been resting on the top of Mount Gud-mountain since evening, like a kite waiting for prey; the snow crunched under our feet; the air became so thin that it hurt to breathe; the blood constantly rushed to my head, but with all that, some kind of gratifying feeling spread through all my veins, and I was somehow glad that I was so high above the world: a childish feeling, I don’t argue, but, moving away from the conditions of society and approaching to nature, we unwittingly become children; everything acquired falls away from the soul, and it becomes again such as it once was, and, surely, will someday be again. Anyone who happened, like me, to wander through the desert mountains, and for a long, long time peer into their bizarre images, and eagerly swallow the life-giving air spilled in their gorges, he, of course, will understand my desire to convey, tell, draw these magical pictures. Finally, we climbed the Gud-mountain, stopped and looked around: a gray cloud hung on it, and its cold breath threatened a coming storm; but in the east everything was so clear and golden that we, that is, I and the staff captain, completely forgot about him ... Yes, and the staff captain: in the hearts of simple people, the feeling of beauty and grandeur of nature is stronger, more alive a hundred times than in us enthusiastic storytellers in words and on paper.","All was quiet on the earth and in the sky, like the heart of a person during the minute of morning prayer. But, occasionally a cool wind would spring up from the east, lifting the manes of the horses, which were coated in frost. We set off; five skinny nags hauled our carts with difficulty along the winding road up Gud Mountain. We walked on foot behind them, putting rocks behind the wheels when the horses ran out of strength. It looked as though the road led to the sky because as far as the eye could see, it kept ascending, and finally, became lost in the clouds, which had rested on the heights of Gud Mountain since the day before, like a kite awaiting its prey. The snow crunched under our feet; the air became so rare that it was painful to breathe; blood flooded into our heads every minute, and with it, some sort of gratifying feeling spread to every vein. I was so delighted to be so high above the world: it was a childlike feeling, I won’t deny it, but withdrawing from the demands of society, and drawing near to nature, we become children without meaning to, and everything that has been acquired falls away from the soul—and it becomes as it once was, and probably will be once again. A person who has found himself wandering, like me, among desert mountains for a long, long time, and peering at their fantastical shapes, and who has greedily swallowed the life-giving air which pours into its gorges—that person, I’m certain, will understand my desire to relate, to tell, to paint these magical pictures. And so, at last, we gained the summit of Gud Mountain, stopped and looked around: there was a gray cloud suspended over it, and its cold breath threatened an approaching storm. But in the east, everything was so clear and golden, that we, that is the staff captain and I, forgot about it completely . . . Yes, even the staff captain forgot: the simple people among us have hearts in which the feeling of beauty, and the grandeur of nature, is stronger—a hundredfold more vivid than in us, the rapturous storytellers in words and on paper.","All was silent in heaven and on earth, as it is in the heart of man at the moment of his morning prayer; only once in a while, a cool wind would come rippling from the east, raising a little the rime-covered manes of the horses. We set out; five skinny nags dragged our carriages with difficulty along the road winding up Mount Gud. We followed on foot, chocking the wheels with stones whenever the horses became exhausted; the road seemed to lead up into the sky because, as far as the eye could see, it kept ascending and, finally, it lost itself in the cloud which, since the previous evening, had been resting on the summit of Mount Gud, like a vulture awaiting its prey; the snow crunched underfoot; the air was becoming so rare, that it was painful to breathe; the blood kept rushing to our heads every moment, but despite all this, a delightful kind of feeling spread along all my veins, and I felt somehow elated at being so far above the world—a childish feeling, no doubt, but, on getting away from social conventions and coming closer to nature, we cannot help becoming children: all the things that have been acquired are shed by the soul, and it becomes again as it was once, and as it is surely to be again some day. He who, like me, has had occasion to wander over wild mountains and scrutinize, for a long time, their fantastic shapes, and avidly swallow the vivifying air pervading their gorges, will certainly understand my desire to render, to relate, to paint those magical images. Finally, we got to the top of Mount Gud, stopped, and looked around us: upon it hung the gray cloud whose cold breath threatened us with a gathering storm; but everything was so limpid and golden-bright in the east that we, that is to say the junior captain and I, completely forgot that cloud. Yes, the junior captain too: in simple hearts, the sense of the beauty and grandeur of nature is a hundred times stronger and more vivid than it is in us, enthusiastic tellers of tales, oral or written.38"
"Я лгал; но мне хотелось его побесить. У меня врожденная страсть противоречить; целая моя жизнь была только цепь грустных и неудачных противоречий сердцу или рассудку. Присутствие энтузиаста обдает меня крещенским холодом, и, я думаю, частые сношения с вялым флегматиком сделали бы из меня страстного мечтателя. Признаюсь еще, чувство неприятное, но знакомое пробежало слегка в это мгновение по моему сердцу; это чувство – было зависть; я говорю смело «зависть», потому что привык себе во всем признаваться; и вряд ли найдется молодой человек, который, встретив хорошенькую женщину, приковавшую его праздное внимание и вдруг явно при нем отличившую другого, ей равно ненакомого, вряд ли, говорю, найдется такой молодой человек (разумеется, живший в большом свете и привыкший баловать свое самлюбие), который бы не был этим поражен неприятно.","I lied; but I wanted to annoy him.

I also confess that an unpleasant, but familiar feeling ran lightly at that moment through my heart; this feeling was envy; I boldly say ""envy"" because I'm used to admitting everything to myself; and it is unlikely that there will be a young man who, having met a pretty woman who has riveted his idle attention and suddenly clearly distinguished another in his presence, who is equally unfamiliar to her, it is unlikely, I say, that there will be such a young man ), who would not be unpleasantly struck by this.","I was lying, but I wanted to infuriate him.

I further confess that a nasty but familiar sensation, at that moment, skimmed over my heart This sensation was envy: I boldly say “envy” because I am used to being frank with myself in everything, and it is doubtful if there can be found a young man who, upon meeting a pretty woman who has riveted his idle attention and has suddenly given obvious preference to another man equally unknown to her, it is doubtful, let me repeat, that there can be found a young man (provided, of course, that he has lived in the grand monde and is accustomed to indulge his vanity), who would not be unpleasantly struck by this."

"Хохот и шушуканье нас окружающих заставили меня обернуться и прервать мою фразу. В нескольких шагах от меня стояла группа мужчин, и в их числе драгунский капитан, изъявивший враждебные намерения против милой княжны; он особенно был чем-то очень доволен, потирал руки, хохотал и перемигивался с товарищами. Вдруг из среды их отделился господин во фраке с длинными усами и красной рожей и направил неверные шаги свои прямо к княжне: он был пьян.

"Тамань – самый скверный городишко из всех приморских городов России. Я там чуть-чуть не умер с голода, да еще в добавок меня хотели утопить. Я приехал на перекладной тележке поздно ночью.

Часовой, черноморский казак, услышав звон колокольчика, закричал спросонья диким голосом: «Кто идет?» Вышел урядник и десятник.

"– А вот я вам расскажу. Верст шесть от крепости жил один мирной князь. Сынишка его, мальчик лет пятнадцати, повадился к нам ездит: всякий день, бывало, то за тем, то за другим; и уж точно, избаловали мы его с Григорием Александровичем. А уж какой был головорез, проворный на что хочешь: шапку ли поднять на всем скаку, из ружья ли стрелять. Одно было в нем нехорошо: ужасно падок был на деньги. Раз, для смеха, Григорий Александрович обещался ему дать червонец, коли он ему украдет лучшего козла из отцовского стада; и что ж вы думаете? на другую же ночь притащил его за рога. А бывало, мы его вздумаем дразнить, так глаза кровью и нальются, и сейчас за кинжал. «Эй, Азамат, не сносить тебе головы, – говорил я ему, яман[2] будет твоя башка!»","- And here I will tell you. About six versts from the fortress lived a peaceful prince. His son, a boy of about fifteen, got into the habit of going to us: every day, it happened, now for one, then for another; and certainly, we spoiled him with Grigory Alexandrovich. And what a thug he was, nimble for whatever you want: whether to raise his hat at full gallop, whether to shoot from a gun. One thing was not good about him: he was terribly greedy for money. Once, for a laugh, Grigory Alexandrovich promised to give him a gold piece if he would steal the best goat from his father's herd for him; and what do you think? the next night he dragged him by the horns. And it happened that we would take it into our head to tease him, so his eyes would fill up with blood, and now for the dagger. “Hey, Azamat, don’t blow your head off,” I told him, yaman [2] will be your head!”","“Well, I’ll explain.

About four miles from the fort, there lived a neutral prince. His young son, a boy of fifteen or so, took to riding over to our place: every day he would come for one thing or another.

I’ll admit I also awaited the appearance of this Pechorin with a certain amount of impatience, though from the staff captain’s tale I had formed an opinion of him that wasn’t very favorable. But several features of his character seemed remarkable to me. After an hour, one of the veterans brought a boiling samovar and a teapot.","Maksim Maksimich seated himself on a bench outside the gate, and I went to my room. I confess that I, too, looked forward rather eagerly for this Pechorin person to appear; and although the idea of him I made myself from the captain’s narrative was not particularly flattering, still certain features of his character seemed to me remarkable. An horn: later, one of the veterans brought in a simmering samovar and a teapot."

"А ведь вышло, что я был прав: подарки подействовали только вполовину; она стала ласковее, доверчивее – да и только; так что он решился на последнее средство. Раз утром он велел оседлать лошадь, оделся по-черкесски, вооружился и вошел к ней. «Бэла! – сказал он, – ты знаешь, как я тебя люблю. Я решился тебя увезти, думая, что ты, когда узнаешь меня, полюбишь; я ошибся: прощай! оставайся полной хозяйкой всего, что я имею; если хочешь, вернись к отцу, – ты свободна. Я виноват перед тобой и должен наказать себя; прощай, я еду – куда? почему я знаю? Авось недолго буду гоняться за пулей или ударом шашки; тогда вспомни обо мне и прости меня». – Он отвернулся и протянул ей руку на прощание. Она не взяла руки, молчала. Только стоя за дверью, я мог в щель рассмотреть ее лицо: и мне стало жаль – такая смертельная бледность покрыла это милое личико! Не слыша ответа, Печорин сделал несколько шагов к двери; он дрожал – и сказать ли вам? я думаю, он в состоянии был исполнить в самом деле то, о чем говорил шутя. Таков уж был человек, бог его знает! Только едва он коснулся двери, как она вскочила, зарыдала и бросилась ему на шею. Поверите ли? я, стоя за дверью, также заплакал, то есть, знаете, не то чтобы заплакал, а так – глупость!..","But it turned out that I was right: the gifts worked only half; she became more affectionate, more trusting - and that's all; so he decided on the last resort. One morning he ordered the horse to be saddled, dressed in Circassian fashion, armed himself and went in to her. Bela! he said, “you know how much I love you. I decided to take you away, thinking that when you get to know me, you will love me; I was wrong: sorry! remain the complete mistress of all that I have; if you want, return to your father - you are free. I am guilty before you and must punish myself; goodbye, I'm going - where? why do i know? Maybe I won’t be chasing a bullet or a blow from a checker for long; then remember me and forgive me.” He turned away and extended his hand to her in farewell. She did not take her hand, she was silent. Only standing outside the door could I see her face through the gap: and I felt sorry - such a deadly pallor covered that pretty face! Hearing no answer, Pechorin took a few steps towards the door; he was trembling - and shall I tell you? I think he was really able to do what he said jokingly. Such was the man, God knows! As soon as he touched the door, she jumped up, sobbed and threw herself on his neck. Would you believe? I, standing outside the door, also began to cry, that is, you know, not really crying, but so - stupidity! ..","“Well, it seemed I was right: the presents worked only partially. She became more affectionate, more trusting—and that was it. So he went to his last resort.

I decided to carry you away, thinking that once you knew me, you would love me too. I was mistaken—farewell! You may be the mistress of everything I possess. If you want, you may return to your father—you are free. I am guilty before you and must punish myself. Farewell, I am going now. Where? How could I know? I may not manage to chase bullets or dodge the thrusts of swords for long: then think of me, and forgive me.’ He turned away and reached his hand back toward her in a parting gesture. She didn’t take the hand, and she said nothing. I could see through a crack as I stood behind the door and I felt such pity for her—such a deathly pallor had spread over that lovely little face! “Not hearing a reply, Pechorin took a few steps toward the door; he was trembling—and shall I tell you? I think he was in such a state that he would have gone through with the business, though it all began in jest. That’s what sort of person he was—unfathomable! He had barely touched the door when she jumped up, sobbed, and threw her arms around his neck. Can you believe it?

"Решительно, я никогда подобной женщины не видывал. Она была далеко не красавица, но я имею свои предубеждения также и насчет красоты. В ней было много породы… порода в женщинах, как и в лошадях, великое дело; это открытие принадлежит Юной Франции[10]. Она, то есть порода, а не Юная Франция, большею частью изобличается в поступи, в руках и ногах; особенно нос много значит. Правильный нос в России реже маленькой ножки. Моей певунье казалось не более восемнадцати лет. Необыкновенная гибкость ее стана, особенное, ей только свойственное наклонение головы, длинные русые волосы, какой-то золотистый отлив ее слегка загорелой кожи на шее и плечах и особенно правильный нос – все это было для меня обворожительно. Хотя в ее косвенных взглядах я читал что-то дикое и подозрительное, хотя в ее улыбке было что-то неопределенное, но такова сила предубеждений: правильный нос свел меня с ума; я вообразил, что нашел Гетеву Миньону[11], это причудливое создание его немецкого воображения, – и точно, между ими было много сходства: те же быстрые переходы от величайшего беспокойства к полной неподвижности, те же загадочные речи, те же прыжки, странные песни.","Certainly, I have never seen such a woman. She was far from beautiful, but I have my own prejudices about beauty as well. There was a lot of breed in her ... breed in women, as in horses, a great thing; this discovery belongs to Young France[10]. She, that is, the breed, and not Young France, is mostly exposed in her steps, in her hands and feet; especially the nose means a lot. The correct nose in Russia is less common than a small leg. My songstress seemed no more than eighteen years old. The extraordinary flexibility of her figure, the special tilt of her head, her long blond hair, some kind of golden tint of her slightly tanned skin on her neck and shoulders, and her especially correct nose - all this was charming for me. Although I read something wild and suspicious in her indirect glances, although there was something indefinite in her smile, but such is the power of prejudice: the right nose drove me crazy; I imagined that I had found Goethe's Mignon[11], this bizarre creation of his German imagination - and indeed, there were many similarities between them: the same rapid transitions from the greatest restlessness to complete immobility, the same cryptic speeches, the same jumps, strange songs .","I have definitely never seen a girl like her. She was far from being a beauty, but then I have prejudices with regard to beauty too. There was a look of breeding to her . . . breeding in women, as in horses, is of great matter. This discovery belongs to La Jeune-France.7 It, beauty that is, not La Jeune-France, is in large part manifested in the gait, in the arms and the legs. The nose is especially telling. A straight nose is rarer in Russia than small feet. My songstress seemed no more than eighteen years old. Her figure had an unusual suppleness to it, she had a particular inclination of the head; she had long light-brown hair, a sort of golden tint to the slightly sun-tanned skin on her neck and her shoulders, and an especially straight nose. All this enchanted me. I read something wild and suspicious in her oblique gaze, and there was something indeterminate in her smile but such is the strength of prejudice: her straight nose had carried me from my senses. I imagined that I had found Goethe ’s Mignon,8 the marvelous creation of his German imagination. Certainly there were many similarities: the same quick transitions between extreme agitation and complete motionlessness, the same mysterious utterances, the same leaping about, and strange songs .","Really, I had never seen such a woman! She was far from beautiful, but I have my preconceptions in regard to beauty, too. She revealed a good deal of breeding … and breeding in women, as in horses, is a great thing: les Jeunes-France68 are responsible for this discovery. It (that is, breeding, not Young France) is most visible in the gait, in the hands and feet; the nose is especially significant. In Russia, a straight nose is rarer than a small foot. My songstress did not appear to be more than eighteen. The extraordinary suppleness of her figure, a special inclination of the head, peculiar to her alone, her long auburn hair, a kind of golden sheen on the slightly sun-tanned skin of her neck and shoulders, and, especially, her straight nose—all this was enchanting to me. Although I detected in her oblique glances something wild and suspicious, and although there was an odd vagueness about her smile, still such is the force of preconception; her straight nose drove me crazy. I imagined I had discovered Goethe’s Mignon69—that extravagant product of his German imagination—and indeed, there was a lot in common between them: the same rapid transitions from intense restlessness to complete immobility, the same enigmatic accents, the same capers and strange songs."

Я помню, одна меня полюбила за то, что я любил другую. Нет ничего парадоксальнее женского ума; женщин трудно убедить в чем-нибудь, надо их довести до того, чтоб они убедили себя сами; порядок доказательств, которыми они уничтожают свои предупреждения, очень оригинален; чтоб выучиться их диалектике, надо опрокинуть в уме своем все школьные правила логики.","I dined with them.

"И точно, такую панораму вряд ли где еще удастся мне видеть: под нами лежала Койшаурская долина, пересекаемая Арагвой и другой речкой, как двумя серебряными нитями; голубоватый туман скользил по ней, убегая в соседние теснины от теплых лучей утра; направо и налево гребни гор, один выше другого, пересекались, тянулись, покрытые снегами, кустарником; вдали те же горы, но хоть бы две скалы, похожие одна на другую, – и все эти снега горели румяным блеском так весело, так ярко, что кажется, тут бы и остаться жить навеки; солнце чуть показалось из-за темно-синей горы, которую только привычный глаз мог бы различить от грозовой тучи; но над солнцем была кровавая полоса, на которую мой товарищ обратил особенное внимание. «Я говорил вам, – воскликнул он, – что нынче будет погода; надо торопиться, а то, пожалуй, она застанет нас на Крестовой.

"– Против вас точно есть заговор, – сказал он. – Я нашел у Грушницкого драгунского капитана и еще одного господина, которого фамилии не помню. Я на минуту остановился в передней, чтоб снять галоши. У них был ужасный шум и спор… «Ни за что не соглашусь! – говорил Грушницкий, – он меня оскорбил публично; тогда было совсем другое…» – «Какое тебе дело? – отвечал капитан, – я все беру на себя. Я был секундантом на пяти дуэлях и уж знаю, как это устроить. Я все придумал. Пожалуйста, только мне не мешай. Постращать не худо. А зачем подвергать себя опасности, если можно избавиться?..» В эту минуту я взошел. Они замолчали. Переговоры наши продолжались довольно долго; наконец мы решили дело вот как: верстах в пяти отсюда есть глухое ущелье; они туда поедут завтра в четыре часа утра, а мы выедем полчаса после них; стреляться будете на шести шагах – этого требовал Грушницкий. Убитого – на счет черкесов. Теперь вот какие у меня подозрения: они, то есть секунданты, должно быть, несколько переменили свой прежний план и хотят зарядить пулею один пистолет Грушницкого. Это немножко похоже на убийство, но в военное время, и особенно в азиатской войне, хитрости позволяются; только Грушницкий, кажется, поблагороднее своих товарищей. Как вы думаете? Должны ли мы показать им, что догадались?","“There is definitely a conspiracy against you,” he said. - I found a dragoon captain at Grushnitsky's and another gentleman whose last name I don't remember. I stopped for a minute in the hall to take off my galoshes. They had a terrible noise and argument ... “I will never agree! - said Grushnitsky, - he insulted me publicly; then it was completely different ... ""-"" What do you care? - answered the captain, - I take everything upon myself. I was a second in five duels and I already know how to arrange it. I came up with everything. Please, just don't bother me. It's not bad to intimidate. And why put yourself in danger if you can get rid of it?..” At that moment I ascended. They fell silent. Our negotiations went on for quite some time; Finally, we settled the matter in the following way: five versts from here there is a deaf gorge; they will go there tomorrow at four o'clock in the morning, and we will leave half an hour after them; you will shoot at six paces - this was demanded by Grushnitsky. Killed - at the expense of the Circassians. Now here are my suspicions: they, that is, the seconds, must have somewhat changed their previous plan and want to load one Grushnitsky pistol with a bullet. It is a little like murder, but in wartime, and especially in the Asiatic war, tricks are allowed; only Grushnitsky seems to be more noble than his comrades. What do you think? Should we show them what we guessed?","“There is definitely a plot against you,” he said. “I found the dragoon captain and another gentleman, whose last name I don’t remember, at Grushnitsky’s place. I paused for a minute in the entrance hall in order to remove my galoshes. There was a terrible noise and argument going on inside . . . “‘I won’t agree to that for anything!’ Grushnitsky was saying. ‘ He insulted me publicly—before that it was entirely different . . .’ “‘What is it to you?’ answered the dragoon captain. ‘I’ll take it all onto myself. I have been a second in five duels and I know well how to arrange it all. I have devised everything. If you please, just don’t get in my way. Giving someone a scare is no bad thing. And why expose yourself to danger, if you can escape it?’ “At that minute I walked up. They went silent. Our negotiations lasted rather a long time; finally we decided the matter thus: about five versts from here, there is a hidden gully. They will go there tomorrow at four o’clock in the morning, and we will depart half an hour after them. Shots will be at six paces—this was requested by Grushnitsky. The dead body will be attributed to the Circassians. Now, these are my suspicions: they, the seconds that is, have somewhat changed their prior plans it seems, and they want to load a bullet into Grushnitsky’s pistol alone. This is a little similar to murder, but in wartime, and especially an Asiatic war, such stratagems are allowed. Only Grushnitsky, it would seem, is a little more noble than his friends. What do you think? Shall we reveal to him that we have figured it out?”","“There is, indeed, a plot against you,” he said. “I found at Grushnitski’s the Captain of Dragoons and yet another gentleman, whose name I do not remember. For a moment I stopped in the vestibule to take off my rubbers. They were making a lot of noise and arguing. ‘For nothing in the world shall I agree,’ Grushnitski was saying. ‘ He insulted me in public: before that, things were entirely different.’ ‘What business is this of yours?’ answered the captain. ‘I take everything upon myself. I was a second in five duels, and you may be sure I know how to arrange it. I have planned it all. Only please do not interfere. It won’t do any harm to scare the fellow. But why expose oneself to danger if one can avoid it? …’ At this moment, I entered. They were suddenly silent. Our negotiations lasted a considerable time. Finally, we decided the matter in the following way: within three miles from here there is a desolate gorge; they will drive there tomorrow at four in the morning, and we shall set out half an hour after them; you will shoot at each other at six paces— Grushnitski himself demanded this. The one who is killed is to be put down to the Circassians. Now, here are my suspicions: they, that is to say the seconds, have apparently altered somewhat their former plan and want to load, with a bullet, only Grushnitski’s pistol. This slightly resembles murder, but in time of war, and especially Asiatic war, trickery is allowed. However, Grushnitski seems to be a little nobler than his companions. What do you think, should we show them that we have found them out?”"

"Я думаю, казаки, зевающие на своих вышках, видя меня скачущего без нужды и цели, долго мучились этой загадкой, ибо, верно, по одежде приняли меня за черкеса. Мне в самом деле говорили, что в черкесском костюме верхом я больше похож на кабардинца, чем многие кабардинцы. И точно, что касается до этой благородной боевой одежды, я совершенный денди: ни одного галуна лишнего; оружие ценное в простой отделке, мех на шапке не слишком длинный, не слишком короткий; ноговицы и черевики пригнаны со всевозможной точностью; бешмет белый, черкеска темно-бурая. Я долго изучал горскую посадку: ничем нельзя так польстить моему самолюбию, как признавая мое искусство в верховой езде на кавказский лад. Я держу четырех лошадей: одну для себя, трех для приятелей, чтоб не скучно было одному таскаться по полям; они берут моих лошадей с удовольствием и никогда со мной не ездят вместе. Было уже шесть часов пополудни, когда вспомнил я, что пора обедать; лошадь моя была измучена; я выехал на дорогу, ведущую из Пятигорска в немецкую колонию, куда часто водяное общество ездит en piquenique[20]. Дорога идет, извиваясь между кустарниками, опускаясь в небольшие овраги, где протекают шумные ручьи под сенью высоких трав; кругом амфитеатром возвышаются синие громады Бешту, Змеиной, Железной и Лысой горы. Спустясь в один из таких оврагов, называемых на здешнем наречии балками, я остановился, чтоб напоить лошадь; в это время показалась на дороге шумная и блестящая кавалькада: дамы в черных и голубых амазонках, кавалеры в костюмах, составляющих смесь черкесского с нижегородским[21]; впереди ехал Грушницкий с княжною Мери.","I think that the Cossacks, yawning on their towers, seeing me galloping without need or purpose, were tormented by this riddle for a long time, because, it’s true, they mistook me for a Circassian by my clothes. In fact, they told me that in a Circassian costume on horseback I look more like a Kabardian than many Kabardians. And for sure, as far as this noble combat clothing is concerned, I am a perfect dandy: not a single extra galloon; a weapon of value in a simple finish, the fur on the hat is not too long, not too short; leggings and slippers fitted with every possible precision; beshmet white, dark brown Circassian. I have long studied mountain landing: nothing can flatter my vanity so much as recognizing my skill in riding in a Caucasian way. I keep four horses: one for myself, three for friends, so that it would not be boring to drag myself through the fields alone; they take my horses with pleasure and never ride with me. It was already six o'clock in the afternoon when I remembered that it was time for dinner; my horse was exhausted; I drove onto the road leading from Pyatigorsk to the German colony, where the water society often travels en piquenique[20]. The road winds through the bushes, descending into small ravines where noisy streams flow under the shade of tall grasses; around the amphitheater rise the blue masses of Beshtu, Serpent, Iron and Bald Mountains. Descending into one of these ravines, called beams in the local dialect, I stopped to water the horse; at this time, a noisy and brilliant cavalcade appeared on the road: ladies in black and blue Amazons, gentlemen in costumes that were a mixture of Circassian and Nizhny Novgorod[21]; Grushnitsky rode ahead with Princess Mary.","I think that the Cossacks, yawning in their watchtowers, seeing me galloping without need or aim, would long be tortured by such a riddle, or, they would likely take me for a Circassian, given my attire. I have actually been told that on horseback, in Circassian costume, I look more Kabardin than most Kabardins. And when it comes to this noble battle attire, I am a perfect dandy: not one bit of extraneous galloon; an expensive weapon with simple finishings; the fur on my hat isn’t too long, too short; leggings and high boots fitted to utter exactitude; a white beshmet, and a dark-brown cherkeska.7 I have long studied the mountain riding style: nothing would flatter my vanity more than an acknowledgment of my art in the Caucasian manner of horsemanship. I keep four horses: one for myself, three for friends, to avoid the boredom of roaming about the fields on one’s own. They take my horses with pleasure and never go out together with me. It was already six hours after midday when I realized it was time to dine. My horse was worn out. I went out onto the road that leads from Pyatigorsk to the German colony where the spa community often goes en pique-nique. The road goes meandering between shrubs, descending into small gullies where brooks flow under the canopy of the long grasses. The blue masses of the peaks—Beshtau, Zmeinaya, Zheleznaya, and Lisaya8—tower above and around like an amphitheater. Having descended into one of the gullies, called balkas in the local dialect, I stopped to let my horse drink. At that moment a noisy and shiny cavalcade appeared on the road. There were ladies in light-blue and black riding habits, and cavaliers in outfits made up of a mixture of Circassian and Nizhny Novgorod styles; and Grushnitsky rode at the front with Princess Mary.","I think that the Cossacks yawning on the top of their watchtowers, upon seeing me galloping without need or goal, ware for a long time tormented by this riddle, for I am sure they must have taken me for a Circassian because of my dress. Indeed, I have been told that when riding in Circassian garb, I look more like a Kabardan than many a Kabardan. And, in point of fact, as regards that noble battle garb, I am an absolute dandy: not one bit of superfluous braid; costly arms in plain setting; the fur of the cap neither too long nor too short; leggings and boots fitted with the utmost exactitude; a white beshmet; a dark-brown cherkeska94. I have studied, for a long time, the mountain peoples’ style of riding: there is no better way of flattering my vanity than to acknowledge my skill in riding a horse in the Caucasian fashion. I keep four horses: one for myself, three for pals, so as not to feel dull while ranging the fields alone: they take my horses with alacrity, and never ride with me. It was already six in the evening, when I remembered that it was time to dine. My horse was worn out; I came out onto the road which led from Pyatigorsk to the German settlement where the spa society frequently went for picnics. The road ran winding among bushes, and descending into small ravines where noisy creeks flowed under the shelter of tall grasses; all around rose an amphitheatre of blue masses—Besh Tau, Snake Mountain, Iron Mountain and Bald Mountain. Upon descending into one of these ravines, called bal-kas95 in the local dialect, I stopped to water my horse. At that moment, there appeared on the road a noisy and resplendent cavalcade, the ladies in black or light-blue riding habits, and the gentlemen in costumes representing a mixture of Circassian and Nizhni-Novgorodan:96 Grushnitski rode in front with Princess Mary."
"Но, увы; комендант ничего не мог сказать мне решительного.

"– Послушай, – сказал Грушницкий очень важно, – пожалуйста, не подшучивай над моей любовью, если хочешь остаться моим приятелем… Видишь: я ее люблю до безумия… и я думаю, я надеюсь, она также меня любит… У меня есть до тебя просьба: ты будешь нынче у них вечером… обещай мне замечать все; я знаю, ты опытен в этих вещах, ты лучше меня знаешь женщин… Женщины! женщины! кто их поймет?

"Вчера я приехал в Пятигорск, нанял квартиру на краю города, на самом высоком месте, у подошвы Машука: во время грозы облака будут спускаться до моей кровли. Нынче в пять часов утра, когда я открыл окно, моя комната наполнилась запахом цветов, растуших в скромном палисаднике. Ветки цветущих черешен смотрят мне в окна, и ветер иногда усыпает мой письменный стол их белыми лепестками. Вид с трех сторон у меня чудесный. На запад пятиглавый Бешту синеет, как «последняя туча рассеянной бури»[12]; на север поднимается Машук, как мохнатая персидская шапка, и закрывает всю эту часть небосклона; на восток смотреть веселее: внизу передо мною пестреет чистенький, новенький городок, шумят целебные ключи, шумит разноязычная толпа, – а там, дальше, амфитеатром громоздятся горы все синее и туманнее, а на краю горизонта тянется серебряная цепь снеговых вершин, начинаясь Казбеком и оканчиваясь двуглавым Эльборусом… Весело жить в такой земле! Какое-то отрадное чувство разлито во всех моих жилах. Воздух чист и свеж, как поцелуй ребенка; солнце ярко, небо сине – чего бы, кажется, больше? – зачем тут страсти, желания, сожаления?.. Однако пора. Пойду к Елизаветинскому источнику: там, говорят, утром собирается все водяное обшество.","Yesterday I arrived in Pyatigorsk, rented an apartment on the edge of the city, on the highest place, at the foot of Mashuk: during a thunderstorm, clouds will descend to my roof. This morning at five o'clock, when I opened the window, my room was filled with the smell of flowers growing in a modest front garden. Branches of blossoming cherries look out my windows, and the wind sometimes strews my desk with their white petals. The view from three sides is wonderful. To the west, the five-headed Beshtu turns blue, like “the last cloud of a scattered storm”[12]; Mashuk rises to the north, like a shaggy Persian hat, and covers this entire part of the sky; it’s more fun to look to the east: down below, a clean, new town is full of colors in front of me, healing springs rustle, a multilingual crowd rustles, - and there, further, mountains are piled up like an amphitheater, all bluer and more foggy, and at the edge of the horizon stretches a silver chain of snow peaks, starting with Kazbek and ending two-headed Elborus ... It's fun to live in such a land! Some kind of gratifying feeling is poured into all my veins. The air is pure and fresh, like the kiss of a child; the sun is bright, the sky is blue - what would seem more? - Why are there passions, desires, regrets? .. However, it's time. I’ll go to the Elizabethan spring: they say that the whole water community gathers there in the morning.","Yesterday I arrived in Pyatigorsk and hired quarters at the edge of town, at the highest point, at the foot of Mount Mashuk. When a storm arrives, the clouds will come right down to my roof. Today, at five o’clock in the morning, when I opened the window, my room filled with the scent of the flowers, which grow inside the modest palisade. The blooming branches of a cherry tree look at me through my window, and the wind strews my writing desk with white petals. The view in three directions is marvelous. To the west the five-headed Beshtau is shining blue, like “the last storm-cloud of a dissipating storm. ”1 To the north rises Mashuk, like a shaggy Persian hat, covering one whole part of the horizon. Looking eastward is more cheering: below, a clean and new little town is flashing its colors, curative springs are babbling, the many-tongued crowd is babbling; in the distance an amphitheater of blue and cloudy hills towers over the town; and farther still, a silver chain of snowy peaks extends along the horizon’s edge, beginning with Kazbek and ending with the two-headed Elbrus . . . What joy to live in such country! A kind of joyful feeling has spread to all my veins. The air is clean and fresh, like the kiss of a baby; the sun is bright, the sky blue—what more could one wish? What place do passions, desires, and regrets have here? . . . But it’s time now. I am going to Elizabeth’s Spring: it is said that the whole spa community gathers there in the morning.","YESTERDAY, I arrived in Pyatigorsk74 and rented lodgings on the outskirts of the town, at its highest point, at the foot of Mount Mashuk: when there is a thunderstorm, the clouds will descend down to my roof. At five this morning, when I opened the window, my room was filled with the perfume of flowers growing in the modest front garden. The branches of cherry trees in bloom look into my window, and the wind occasionally strews my desk with their white petals. The view on three sides is marvelous: to the west, the five-peaked Besh Tau looms blue like “the last thundercloud of a tempest dispersed”;75 to the north, Mount Mashuk rises like a shaggy Persian fur cap and closes off all that part of the horizon; to the east, the outlook is gayer; right below me, lies the varicolored, neat, brand-new little town, the medicinal springs babble, and so does the multilingual crowd; and, beyond the town, amphitheatrical mountains pile up, ever bluer and mistier, while on the edge of the horizon there stretches a silver range of snowy summits, beginning with Mount Kazbek, and ending with the bicephalous Mount Elbruz.76 It is gay to live in such country! A kind of joyful feeling permeates all my veins. The air is pure and fresh, like the kiss of a child, the sun is bright, the sky is blue—what more, it seems, could one wish? Who, here, needs passions, desires, regrets? However, it is time. I shall go to the Elizabeth Spring: there, I am told, the entire spa society gathers in the morning."
"Признаюсь, сколько я ни старался различить вдалеке что-нибудь наподобие лодки, но безуспешно. Так прошло минут десять; и вот показалась между горами волн черная точка; она то увеличивалась, то уменьшалась. Медленно поднимаясь на хребты волн, быстро спускаясь с них, приближалась к берегу лодка. Отважен был пловец, решившийся в такую ночь пуститься через пролив на расстояние двадцати верст, и важная должна быть причина, его к тому побудившая! Думая так, я с невольном биением сердца глядел на бедную лодку; но она, как утка, ныряла и потом, быстро взмахнув веслами, будто крыльями, выскакивала из пропасти среди брызгов пены; и вот, я думал, она ударится с размаха об берег и разлетится вдребезги; но она ловко повернулась боком и вскочила в маленькую бухту невредима. Из нее вышел человек среднего роста, в татарской бараньей шапке; он махнул рукою, и все трое принялись вытаскивать что-то из лодки; груз был так велик, что я до сих пор не понимаю, как она не потонула. Взяв на плечи каждый по узлу, они пустились вдоль по берегу, и скоро я потерял их из вида. Надо было вернуться домой; но, признаюсь, все эти странности меня тревожили, и я насилу дождался утра.","I confess that no matter how hard I tried to discern in the distance something like a boat, but to no avail. So ten minutes passed; and now a black dot appeared between the mountains of waves; it either increased or decreased. Slowly climbing the ridges of the waves, quickly descending from them, the boat approached the shore. The swimmer was brave, who decided on such a night to set off across the strait for a distance of twenty miles, and there must be an important reason that prompted him to do so! Thinking so, I looked at the poor boat with an involuntary beating of my heart; but she, like a duck, dived and then, quickly flapping her oars, as if with wings, jumped out of the abyss among splashes of foam; and behold, I thought, she would hit the shore with a swing and shatter into smithereens; but she deftly turned sideways and jumped into the little bay unharmed. A man of medium height stepped out of it, wearing a Tatar ram's hat; he waved his hand, and all three began to pull something out of the boat; the load was so great that I still do not understand how she did not drown. Taking a bundle on their shoulders, they set off along the shore, and soon I lost sight of them. I had to go home; but, I confess, all these oddities disturbed me, and I could hardly wait for morning.","I admit, as hard as I tried to make out in the distance anything that resembled a boat, I was unsuccessful. Thus passed about ten minutes. And then, a black dot appeared between the mountains of waves. It grew larger and smaller in turns. Slowly climbing up to the peak of a wave, and quickly falling from it, a boat was approaching the shore. Brave was the seaman who decided to set out across the strait at a distance of twenty versts on such a night, and important must his reason have been, to have induced him to it! Thinking this, with an involuntary beating of my heart, I looked at the poor boat, but like a duck, it dived under and then, rapidly waving its oars, like wings, sprang out of the depths in a spray of foam. And I thought to myself, it is going to strike against the shore with all its might and fly into pieces. But it turned deftly to one side, and hurdled unharmed into a small bay. A man of medium height, in a Tatar sheepswool hat, emerged from it. He waved an arm and the three of them took to dragging something out of the boat. The load was so great that even now I don’t understand how it hadn’t sunk. Each took a bundle onto his shoulder and they set off along the shoreline; and soon I lost sight of them. I had to go back, but I confess that all these odd things had perturbed me, and I barely managed to wait until morning.","I confess that no matter how I strained to make out, in the distance, anything resembling a boat, my efforts were in vain. Some ten minutes elapsed; then, amid the mountains of the waves, a black dot appeared; it grew now bigger, now smaller. Slowly rising upon the wave crests, and rapidly coming down them, a boat was nearing the shore. He must be a valiant navigator, indeed, to venture on such a night to cross the straits, a distance of fifteen miles; and it must be an important reason that induced him to do sol These were my thoughts as, with an involuntary throbbing of the heart, I looked at the wretched boat; but she kept diving like a duck and then, with a wing-like upsweep of oars, would spring out of the abyss amid a burst of foam; and now, I thought, her impetus will dash her against the shore and she will be smashed to bits; but cleverly she turned sideways and bounded, unharmed, into a cove. A man of medium height, in a Tatar cap of sheepskin, came ashore. He waved his hand, and all three began to drag something out of the boat; the load was so great that, to this day, I cannot understand how she had not sunk. Each having shouldered a bundle, they started to walk away along the coast, and I soon lost sight of them. I had to go back to my lodgings; but, I confess, all these strange things worried me, and I had a hard time awaiting the morning."
"– Mon cher, – отвечал я ему, стараясь подделаться под его тон, – je meprise les femmes pour ne pas les aimer car autrement la vie serait un melodrame trop ridicule[17].","“Mon cher,” I answered him, trying to imitate his tone, “je meprise les femmes pour ne pas les aimer car autrement la vie serait un melodrame trop ridicule.”","“Mon cher,” I replied to him, attempting to imitate his tone, “je méprise les femmes pour ne pas les aimer, car autrement la vie serait un mélodrame trop ridicule.”6","“Mon cher,” I answered trying to copy his manner, “je méprise les femmes pour ne pas les aimer, car autrement la vie serait un mélodrame trop ridicule.”"

"Вулич вышел молча в спальню майора; мы за ним последовали. Он подошел к стене, на которой висело оружие, и наудачу снял с гвоздя один из разнокалиберных пистолетов; мы еще его не понимали; но когда он взвел курок и насыпал на полку пороху, то многие, невольно вскрикнув, схватили его за руки.","Vulich went silently into the major's bedroom; we followed him. He went to the wall on which the weapon hung, and at random removed one of the pistols of different calibers from a nail; we didn't understand it yet; but when he cocked the trigger and poured gunpowder on the shelf, many, involuntarily crying out, grabbed his hands.","Vulich went into the major’s sleeping quarters without saying anything; we followed him. He walked up to a wall where some guns were hanging. At random he took down one of the variously calibered pistols from its nail; we still didn’t understand him but when he cocked the gun and poured gunpowder into the pan, many couldn’t help but cry out, and they grabbed his arms.","Vulich without a word walked into the major’s bedroom: we followed him. He went to the wall where there hung some weapons, and among pistols of various caliber, he, at random, took one down from its nail.

"– Ни за что на свете, доктор! – отвечал я, удерживая его за руку, – вы все испортите; вы мне дали слово не мешать… Какое вам дело? Может быть, я хочу быть убит…","“No way in the world, doctor!” - I answered, holding his hand, - you will ruin everything; you gave me your word not to interfere ... What do you care? Maybe I want to be killed...","“Not for anything in the world, doctor!” I answered, holding him back by the arm. “You will ruin everything. You gave me your word that you wouldn’t get in my way . . . What is it to you? Perhaps I want to be killed . . .”","“Not for anything in the world, doctor!” I replied, holding him back by the arm. “You would spoil everything.

"– Признайтесь, однако, – сказал я, – что без них нам было бы хуже.","“Confess, however,” I said, “that it would be worse for us without them.","“You must admit, though,” I said, “that things would be worse without them.”","“Still, you must admit,” said I, “that, without them, we would have been worse off.”"
"И в самом деле, Гуд-гора курилась; по бокам ее ползали легкие струйки – облаков, а на вершине лежала черная туча, такая черная, что на темном небе она казалась пятном.","And in fact, Good Mountain smoked; light streams of clouds crawled along its sides, and on top lay a black cloud, so black that it seemed like a spot in the dark sky.","And it was true, Gud Mountain was smoking. Light little currents of cloud were creeping down its slopes, and a black storm cloud sat at its summit, so black that it looked like a blot on the dark sky.","And indeed, Mount Gud was smoking; along its flanks there crept light wisps of clouds, while on its summit there lay a black cloud, so black that it looked like a blot on the dark sky."
"– Да, я случайно слышал, – отвечал он, покраснев, – признаюсь, я не желаю с ними познакомиться. Эта гордая знать смотрит на нас, армейцев, как на диких. И какое им дело, есть ли ум под нумерованной фуражкой и сердце под толстой шинелью?","“Yes, I heard by chance,” he answered, blushing, “I confess that I do not want to meet them. This proud nobility looks at us, the army, as wild. And what do they care if there is a mind under a numbered cap and a heart under a thick overcoat?","“Yes, I heard it accidentally,” he replied, blushing. “I admit that I don’t want to be introduced. This proud nobility looks at us army-men like savages. And what is it to them whether there is a mind underneath this numbered military cap and a heart beneath this heavy greatcoat?”","“Yes, I happened to hear it,” he answered flushing. “I confess, I do not wish to meet them. Those proud aristocrats look upon us army men as savages. And what do they care whether or not there is a mind under a numbered regimental cap and a heart under a thick army coat?”81"
"Я отвечал, что много есть людей, говорящих то же самое; что есть, вероятно, и такие, которые говорят правду; что, впрочем, разочарование, как все моды, начав с высших слоев общества, спустилось к низшим, которые его донашивают, и что нынче те, которые больше всех и в самом деле скучают, стараются скрыть это несчастье, как порок. Штабс-капитан не понял этих тонкостей, покачал головою и улыбнулся лукаво:","I answered that there are many people who say the same thing; that there are probably those who tell the truth; that, however, disappointment, like all fashions, starting from the upper strata of society, descended to the lower ones, who wear it out, and that now those who really miss it the most are trying to hide this misfortune as a vice. The captain did not understand these subtleties, shook his head and smiled slyly:","I answered that there are many people who speak in the same way; that there are, probably, some that are telling the truth; however, disillusionment, like every fashion, having begun at the highest social strata, had descended to the lower strata, who were now wearing it out, and that now, those who are most bored of all try to hide this misfortune as though it were a vice. The staff captain didn’t understand these nuances, shook his head, and smiled slyly.","I replied that there were many people who talked like that; that probably there were some who were telling the truth; that, on the other hand, disillusionment, like all fashions, having begun in the upper strata of society, had descended to the lower, which were now wearing it out, and that nowadays those people who were really bored the most tried to conceal this misfortune as though it were a vice.

Дверь сама отворилась; из хаты повеяло сыростью. Я засветил серную спичку и поднес ее к носу мальчика: она озарила два белые глаза. Он был слепой, совершенно слепой от природы.

The door opened of its own accord; dampness wafted from the hut. I lit a sulfur match and brought it to the boy's nose: it lit up two white eyes. He was blind, totally blind by nature. He stood motionless in front of me, and I began to examine the features of his face.","“Where is the proprietor?” “No.” The boy spoke in a Ukrainian dialect. “What? He’s not here at all?” “Not at all.” “And the proprietress?” “Run off to the slobodka.”3 “Who then will open the door for me?” I said, kicking it with my foot. The door opened. A dampness blew softly from the peasant house. I struck a sulfur match and put it up to the boy’s nose. It illuminated two white eyes. He was blind, completely blind from birth. He stood in front of me without moving, and I began to scrutinize the features of his face.","“Where is the landlord?” “No landlord.” “How’s that? None at all?” “None.” “And what about a landlady?” “Gone to the settlement” “Then who’ll open the door for me?” I asked, and gave it a kick.

He was blind, totally blind from birth. He stood motionless before me and I began to examine his features."
"Засверкали глазенки у татарчонка, а Печорин будто не замечает; я заговорю о другом, а он, смотришь, тотчас собьет разговор на лошадь Казбича.

How extraordinary!","“The little Moslem’s eyes sparkled, but Pechorin seemed not to notice; I would start speaking of something else, but before you knew, he had switched the talk back to Kazbich’s horse.

"Через полчаса и я отправился. На улице было темно и пусто; вокруг собрания или трактира, как угодно, теснился народ; окна его светились; звуки полковой музыки доносил ко мне вечерний ветер.

Since I have been living and acting, fate has somehow always led me to the denouement of other people's dramas, as if without me no one could die or despair! I was the necessary face of the fifth act; involuntarily I played the pitiful role of executioner or traitor. What purpose did fate have for this?.. Haven’t I already been appointed by her to the writers of petty-bourgeois tragedies and family novels - or to the staff of the supplier of stories, for example, for the “Library for Reading”? life, they think of ending it like Alexander the Great or Lord Byron, and yet for a century remain titular advisers?...","I set off half an hour later.

Хороша совесть!","For half the next day she was quiet, silent and obedient, no matter how our doctor tortured her with poultices and potions. “Excuse me,” I told him, “after all, you yourself said that she would certainly die, so why are all your drugs here?” “Still, it’s better, Maxim Maksimych,” he answered, “that the conscience be at peace.” Good conscience!","“The first half of the next day she was quiet, un-talking and obedient, as the doctor tortured her with poultices and mixtures. “‘For pity’s sake!’ I said to him. ‘ You said yourself that she would die for certain, so why all these medical preparations? ’ “‘It’s still better than nothing, Maxim Maximych,’ he responded, ‘for the sake of a peaceful conscience.’ A peaceful conscience!","“For half the next day, she was calm, silent and submissive, no matter how much our army doctor tormented her with poultices and potions. ‘For goodness’ sake,’ I told him, ‘haven’t you said yourself that she was sure to die, why then all those medications of yours?’ ‘Still it’s better this way, Maksim Maksimich,’ he answered, ‘so as to have a clear conscience.’ A clear conscience, indeed!"
Грушницкий вскочил с своего места и хотел разгорячиться.,Grushnitsky jumped up from his seat and wanted to get excited.,Grushnitsky leapt up from his place and made motions of becoming impassioned.,Grushnitski jumped up from his seat and was about to flare up.
"Мы пошли. Они рассказали мне все, что случилось, с примесью разных замечаний насчет странного предопределения, которое спасло его от неминуемой смерти за полчаса до смерти. Вулич шел один по темной улице: на него наскочил пьяный казак, изрубивший свинью и, может быть, прошел бы мимо, не заметив его, если б Вулич, вдруг остановясь, не сказал: «Кого ты, братец, ищешь?» – «Тебя!» – отвечал казак, ударив его шашкой, и разрубил его от плеча почти до сердца… Два казака, встретившие меня и следившие за убийцей, подоспели, подняли раненого, но он был уже при последнем издыхании и сказал только два слова: «Он прав!» Я один понимал темное значение этих слов: они относились ко мне; я предсказал невольно бедному его судьбу; мой инстинкт не обманул меня: я точно прочел на его изменившемся лице печать близкой кончины.","We're going. They told me everything that had happened, with an admixture of various remarks about the strange predestination that had saved him from certain death half an hour before his death. Vulich was walking alone along a dark street: a drunken Cossack jumped on him, chopping up a pig and, perhaps, would have passed by without noticing him, if Vulich, suddenly stopping, had not said: “Whom are you looking for, brother?” - ""You!"" - answered the Cossack, hitting him with a saber, and cut him from the shoulder almost to the heart ... Two Cossacks, who met me and followed the killer, arrived in time, raised the wounded man, but he was already at his last breath and said only two words: “He is right!” I alone understood the dark meaning of these words: they applied to me; I predicted unwittingly the poor man's fate; my instinct did not deceive me: I definitely read on his changed face the seal of imminent death.","We went off. They told me all that had happened, adding remarks about the strange predestination that had saved him from inevitable death half an hour before his death. Vulich had been walking alone along a dark street; the drunk Cossack who had cleaved the swine galloped at him and might have passed him by without noticing Vulich had the latter not stopped and said: “Brother, whom are you looking for?” “You!” replied the Cossack, striking him with his saber, slicing him from the shoulder almost to the heart . . . The two Cossacks I encountered, who had been tracking the murderer, had appeared just then; they picked up the wounded man, but he was already at his final breath, saying, “He was right!” I alone understood the dark meaning of these words. They referred to me. I had involuntarily predicted his poor fate. My instinct had not fooled me. I had correctly read the stamp of near demise in his altered face.","Off we went. They told me all that had happened with an admixture of various remarks regarding the strange predestination which had saved him from inevitable death, half an hour before his death. Vulich had been walking alone in a dark street. The drunken Cossack, who had hacked up the pig, happened to pitch into him, and would, perhaps, have gone on without taking notice of him, had not Vulich stopped short and said: “Whom are you looking for, man?” “You!” answered the Cossack, striking him with his sword, and cutting him in two, from the shoulder almost down to the heart. The two Cossacks who had met me and who were on the lookout for the murderer, came along; they picked up the wounded officer, but he was already breathing his last and said only three words: “He was right!” I alone understood the obscure meaning of these words: they referred to me. I had unwittingly foretold the poor fellow’s fate; my intuition had not betrayed me; I had really read upon his altered face, the imprint of his imminent end."
"Я возвратился домой. В сенях трещала догоревшая свеча в деревянной тарелке, и казак мой, вопреки приказанию, спал крепким сном, держа ружье обеими руками. Я его оставил в покое, взял свечу и пошел в хату. Увы! моя шкатулка, шашка с серебряной оправой, дагестанский кинжал – подарок приятеля – все исчезло. Тут-то я догадался, какие вещи тащил проклятый слепой. Разбудив казака довольно невежливым толчком, я побранил его, посердился, а делать было нечего! И не смешно ли было бы жаловаться начальству, что слепой мальчик меня обокрал, а восьмнадцатилетняя девушка чуть-чуть не утопила?","I returned home. In the passage a burned-out candle crackled in a wooden plate, and my Cossack, contrary to orders, slept soundly, holding his gun in both hands. I left him alone, took a candle and went into the hut. Alas! my box, a saber with a silver frame, a Dagestan dagger - a gift from a friend - everything disappeared. It was then that I guessed what kind of things the damned blind man was carrying. Having woken up the Cossack with a rather impolite push, I scolded him, got angry, but there was nothing to do! And wouldn't it be ridiculous to complain to the authorities that a blind boy robbed me, and an eighteen-year-old girl almost drowned me?","I returned to the peasant house. In the vestibule there was a burned-out candle on a wooden dish, and my Cossack, contrary to orders, was in a deep sleep, holding his rifle with both hands. I left him in peace, took the candle, and went into the peasant house. Alas! My case, my silver-worked saber, my Dagestani dagger (a present from a friend)—all had disappeared. Then I guessed just what things the damned blind boy had been lugging. Having awakened the Cossack with a sufficiently impolite shove, I scolded him, got angry, but there was nothing to be done! And wouldn’t it be amusing to complain to the authorities that I had been robbed by a blind boy and nearly drowned by an eighteen-year-old girl?","I returned to my lodgings. In the hallway, the burned-down candle sputtered in a wooden plate, and my Cossack, despite my orders, lay sound asleep, holding his rifle in both hands. I left him in peace, took the candle and went into the interior of the hut. Alas! My traveling box, my sword chased with silver, my Dagestan dagger—a present from a pal—all had disappeared. It was then that I realized the nature of the things that the confounded blind lad had been hauling. Upon rousing the Cossack with a rather uncivil push, I scolded him and vented my anger a little, but there was nothing to be done! Really, would it not be absurd to complain to the authorities that I had been robbed by a blind boy, and had almost been drowned by an eighteen-year- old girl?"

"Нынче поутру мой муж вошел ко мне и рассказал про твою ссору с Грушницким.

"– Заметьте, любезный доктор, – сказал я, – что без дураков было бы на свете очень скучно!.. Посмотрите, вот нас двое умных людей; мы знаем заране, что обо всем можно спорить до бесконечности, и потому не спорим; мы знаем почти все сокровенные мысли друг друга; одно слово – для нас целая история; видим зерно каждого нашего чувства сквозь тройную оболочку. Печальное нам смешно, смешное грустно, а вообще, по правде, мы ко всему довольно равнодушны, кроме самих себя. Итак, размена чувств и мыслей между нами не может быть: мы знаем один о другом все, что хотим знать, и знать больше не хотим. Остается одно средство: рассказывать новости.
