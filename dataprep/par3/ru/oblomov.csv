"Между тем и ему долго, почти всю жизнь предстояла еще немалая забота поддерживать на одной высоте свое достоинство мужчины в глазах самолюбивой, гордой Ольги не из пошлой ревности, а для того, чтоб не помрачилась эта хрустальная жизнь; а это могло бы случиться, если б хоть немного поколебалась ее вера в него.","Meanwhile, for a long time, almost all his life, he still had to take considerable care to maintain his dignity as a man at the same height in the eyes of proud, proud Olga, not out of vulgar jealousy, but so that this crystal life would not be darkened; and this might have happened if her faith in him had been shaken a little.","Meanwhile, for a long time, almost his whole life, he had faced the considerable concern of maintaining his dignity as a man in the eyes of ambitious and proud Olga, not out of base jealousy but so that this crystalline life would not dim, which could happen if her faith in him wavered the least bit.","Meanwhile he, too, was faced for years, for almost his whole life, with the not inconsiderable task of maintaining his dignity as a man on the same high level in the eyes of a woman so proud and with so proper a regard for her own self-respect as Olga, not out of vulgar jealousy, but so as to make sure that her life, which was clear as crystal, should not be darkened; and this might well happen if her faith in him were in the least shaken.","The love beheld in that vision was a love which, unfading and indestructible, expressed itself on the features of husband and wife only during seasons of mutual sorrow, and shone forth only in slow, silent glances of mutual sympathy, and voiced itself only in a constant, joint endurance of the trials of life as he and she restrained the tears, and choked back the sobs, which those trials called forth."

"— Помню, — продолжал Штольц, — как ты однажды принес мне перевод из Сея, с посвящением мне в именины; перевод цел у меня. А как ты запирался с учителем математики, хотел непременно добиться, зачем тебе знать круги и квадраты, но на половине бросил и не добился? По-английски начал учиться… и не доучился!

Я два раза был за границей, после нашей премудрости, смиренно сидел на студенческих скамьях в Бонне, в Иене, в Эрлангене, потом выучил Европу, как свое имение.

You've always been a bit of an actor. Well, Ilya? I was twice abroad, after our wisdom, humbly sat on the student benches in Bonn, in Jena, in Erlangen, then I learned Europe as my estate.

I’ve been abroad twice, seeking wisdom, and I sat humbly on student benches in Bonn, Jena, and Erlangen, and then I learned Europe as if it were my own estate. A voyage is a luxury, I’ll grant you that, and not everyone is in a position or obliged to enjoy this means, but what about Russia? I’ve seen the length and breadth of Russia. I work—”","‘I remember,’ Stolz went on, ‘how once you brought me a translation from a book by Jean-Baptiste Say which you dedicated to me on my name-day. I have it still. And how you used to closet yourself with the teacher of mathematics because you were determined to find out why you had to know all about circles and squares, but threw it up half-way and never found out! You began to learn English and – never did learn it! And when I drew up a plan for a journey abroad and asked you to take a course at the German universities with me, you jumped to your feet, embraced me, and solemnly held out your hand to me: “I’m yours, Andrey, and I will go with you everywhere” – those were your very words.

He took one look at her and suddenly lost heart. His joy vanished into thin air. It was as if Olga had aged subtly. She was pale but her eyes were glittering.

His joy vanished: Olga seemed to have aged. She was pale, but her eyes glittered; an intense inner life was hidden in her tightly closed lips and in every feature of her face, a life bound, as with ice, by her enforced calm and immobility.","ZAKHAR, after closing the door successively behind Tarantiev and Alexiev, stood expecting to receive a summons from his master, inasmuch as he had overheard the fact that the latter had undertaken to write a letter. But in Oblomov's study all remained silent as the tomb."
"— Пока она смотрела только на меня, — прибавил он, — я ничего; но когда этот же взгляд упал на тебя, у меня руки и ноги похолодели…","“As long as she looked only at me,” he added, “I was nothing; but when that same look fell on you, my hands and feet went cold...","“As long as she was looking only at me,” he added, “I didn’t mind.

"— Наведены, наведены сегодня в ночь! — радостно сказала она и приняла быстро вскочившую с постели барышню на руки, накинула на нее блузу и пододвинула крошечные туфли. Ольга проворно отворила ящик, вынула что-то оттуда и опустила в руку Кате, а Катя поцеловала у ней руку. Все это — прыжок с постели, опущенная монета в руку Кати и поцелуй барышниной руки — случилось в одну и ту же минуту. «Ах, завтра воскресенье: как это кстати! Он придет!» — подумала Ольга и живо оделась, наскоро напилась чаю и поехала с теткой в магазин.","- Pointed, pointed tonight! she said happily, and took the young lady, who quickly jumped out of bed, into her arms, threw a blouse over her and pushed her tiny shoes. Olga deftly opened the drawer, took something out and put it in Katya's hand, and Katya kissed her hand. All this - jumping out of bed, dropping a coin into Katya's hand and kissing the young lady's hand - happened at the same moment. “Oh, tomorrow is Sunday: how fitting! He will come!"" thought Olga, and she dressed herself briskly, drank her tea hastily, and went with her aunt to the store.","“They’re down, they were lowered last night!” she said joyously, and she pulled the young lady, who had jumped up from the bed, by the hands, threw her smock on, and pushed over her tiny slippers. Olga quickly opened the drawer, pulled something out, and dropped it into Katya’s hand, and Katya kissed her hand. All this—the jump out of bed, the coin dropped in Katya’s hand, and the kiss of the young lady’s hand—happened in a single minute. Oh, tomorrow is Sunday. How fortunate that is! He will come! thought Olga and she quickly dressed, drank her tea, and went to the store with her aunt.","‘They were put back last night!’ she cried joyfully, caught Olga, who had jumped out of bed, in her arms, threw her dressing-gown round her, and helped her into her tiny slippers. Olga quickly opened a box, took something out of it, and put it in Katya’s hand. Katya kissed her hand. All this – her jumping out of bed, the coin dropped into Katya’s hand and Katya’s kiss – happened in one minute. ‘Oh, to-morrow’s Sunday: how lucky! He’ll be coming!’ thought Olga. She dressed quickly, had her breakfast, and went shopping with her aunt.","Much the same thing was to be seen in the case of the pictures, the vases, and certain other trifles of the apartment. Nevertheless, its master was accustomed to regard its appurtenances with the cold, detached eye of one who would ask, ""Who has dared to bring this stuff here?"" The same indifference on his part, added to, perhaps, an even greater indifference on the part of his servant, Zakhar, caused the study, when contemplated with attention, to strike the beholder with an impression of all-prevailing carelessness and neglect. On the walls and around the pictures there hung cobwebs coated with dust; the mirrors, instead of reflecting, would more usefully have served as tablets for recording memoranda; every mat was freely spotted with stains; on the sofa there lay a forgotten towel, and on the table (as on most mornings) a plate, a salt-cellar, a half-eaten crust of bread, and some scattered crumbs--all of which had failed to be cleared away after last night's supper. Indeed, were it not for the plate, for a recently smoked pipe that was propped against the bed, and for the recumbent form of Oblomov himself, one might have imagined that the place contained not a single living soul, so dusty and discoloured did everything look, and so lacking were any active traces of the presence of a human being."

"— Какое болтать! Я и в мыслях не думаю, не токмо что болтать, — трещала Анисья, как будто лучину щепала, — да ничего и нет, в первый раз слышу сегодня, вот перед Господом Богом, сквозь землю провалиться! Удивилась, как барин молвил мне, испугалась, даже затряслась вся! Как это можно? Какая свадьба? Никому и во сне не грезилось. Я ни с кем ничего не говорю, все на кухне сижу. С Ильинскими людьми не видалась с месяц, забыла, как их и зовут. А здесь с кем болтать? С хозяйкой только и разговору, что о хозяйстве; с бабушкой говорить нельзя: та кашляет да и на ухо крепка; Акулина дура набитая, а дворник пьяница; остаются ребятишки только: с теми что говорить? Да я и барышню в лицо забыла…","- What a chat! I don’t even think in my thoughts, let alone talk, - Anisya crackled, as if she was chipping a torch, - but there’s nothing, for the first time I hear it today, before the Lord God, fall through the earth!

I haven’t seen the Ilyinsky people for a month, I forgot what their names are. And who is there to talk to? With the hostess, only conversation was about the household; you can’t talk to your grandmother: she coughs and is strong in the ear; Akulina is a stuffed fool, and the janitor is a drunkard; only children remain: what to say with those? Yes, I forgot the young lady in the face ...","“What idle nonsense! I don’t even think it, let alone say it,” crackled Anisya, as if she were a burning torch. “There’s nothing to it.

No one ever dreamed of it. I don’t talk to anyone. I sit in the kitchen all the time. I haven’t seen the Ilinsky servants for a month. I’ve even forgotten their names. Who am I going to gossip with here? All I talk with the mistress about is the household, and you can’t talk to the old woman because she’s always coughing and her ear’s not too strong.

Why, sir, I don’t think about it, let alone talk,’ Anisya rattled on, just as though she were chopping up sticks. ‘ Besides, sir, there’s nothing to talk about, is there? It’s the first time I’ve heard of it to-day, and that’s the truth, may the Lord strike me dead if it isn’t! I wasn’t half surprised when you told me about it, sir.

Frequently the gropings of a vivid, excitable intellect transcend the limits of everyday existence, and, finding no answer to what that intellect demands of life, become converted into despondency and a temporary dissatisfaction with life.

"Страстно преданный барину, он, однако ж, редкий день в чем-нибудь не солжет ему.

Тот крепче всякого сундука сбережет барские деньги, а Захар норовит усчитать у барина при какой-нибудь издержке гривенник и непременно присвоит себе лежащую на столе медную гривну или пятак.

In the same way, if Ilya Ilyich forgets to demand change from Zakhar, she will never come back to him.","While passionately devoted to his master, it was a rare day, nonetheless, that he did not lie to him about something.

The one guarded his master’s money better than any safe, but Zakhar always tried to cheat his master of ten copecks over some purchase and never failed to appropriate any coppers that were left lying on the table.

No such words were to be found in her brother’s, Tarantyev’s, or her sister-in-law’s vocabulary, because they all lacked the ideas those words expressed; only Oblomov would have understood her, but she never told him, because at the time she did not understand it herself and did not know how to express it.","Greatly she had loved, and to the full: she had loved Oblomov as a lover, as a husband, and as a barin.

Но поведу твоего Андрея, куда ты не мог идти… и с ним будем проводить в дело наши юношеские мечты».","“No, I won’t forget your Andrei,” Stoltz thought sadly, walking through the yard. “You are dead, Ilya: there’s nothing to tell you that your Oblomovka is no longer in the wilderness, that the turn has come to her, that the rays of the sun have fallen on her! I won’t tell you that in four years it will be a road station, that your men will go to work on the embankment, and then your bread will roll along the iron to the pier ... And there ... schools, diploma, and then ... No, you will be frightened of the dawn of a new happiness, it will hurt unaccustomed eyes. But I will take your Andrey where you could not go ... and with him we will put our youthful dreams into action.","No, I won’t forget your Andrei! thought Stolz with sadness as he walked through the yard. You’re lost, Ilya. There’s no point telling you that your Oblomovka is a backwater no more, that its turn has come, that the sun’s rays have fallen on it! I won’t tell you that in four years it will be a rail station, that your muzhiks will go to work the embankment, and then your wheat will travel to the landing by rail. There are schools, learning, and more. No, you would be too frightened by the dawn of this new happiness, it would hurt your unaccustomed eyes. But I will take your Andrei where you couldn’t go, and he and I will make your youthful dreams come true.","‘No, I shall not forget your Andrey,’ Stolz thought sadly as he walked across the yard. ‘You’re done for, Ilya: it is useless to tell you that your Oblomovka is no longer in the wilds, that its turn has come, and that the rays of sunshine have at last fallen upon it! I shall not tell you that in another four years there will be a railway station there, that your peasants will be working on the line, and that later on your corn will be carried by train to the quayside. And then – schools, education, and after that – but no! You will be frightened of the dawn of new happiness; it will hurt your eyes that are unaccustomed to the bright light. But I shall lead your Andrey to where you would not go, and I will carry out your youthful dreams together with him.","""No, never will I forget your little Andrei,"" thought Schtoltz sadly as he drove homewards. "" Ah, Ilya, you are lost beyond recall! It would be useless now to tell you that your Oblomovka is no longer in ruins, that its turn is come again, and that it is basking in the rays of the sun. It would be useless now to tell you that, some four years hence, it will have a railway-station, and that your peasantry are clearing away the rubbish there, and that before long an iron road will be carrying your grain to the wharves, and that already local schools have been built. Such a dawn of good fortune would merely affright you; it would merely cause your unaccustomed eyes to smart. Yet along the road which you could not tread I will lead your little Andrei; and with him I will put into practice those theories whereof you and I used to dream in the days of our youth."

She lived feeling that her life was full as it had never been before; but, as before, she would never be able to express it in words or, rather , it never occurred to her to do so. She merely prayed that God would prolong Oblomov’s life and save him from ‘sorrow, wrath, and want’, committing herself, her children, and her entire household to God’s will. But, as though to make up for it, her face always wore the same expression of complete and perfect happiness, without desires and therefore rare, and, indeed, impossible for a person of a different temperament.","Ever since the day when Schtoltz had cleared him of debt, and Tarantiev and Tarantiev's friend had taken themselves off for good, every adverse element had disappeared from Oblomov's existence, and there surrounded him only good, kind, sensible folk who had agreed to underpin his existence with theirs, and to help him not to notice it, nor to feel it, as it pursued its even course."

At Schtoltz's prompting she sang several arias and romances, of which some expressed suffering, with a vague forecast of joy, while others expressed joy, coupled with a lurking germ of sorrow.

In fact, he would have undertaken the tour abroad if thereby he could have remained where he was at that moment, and then gone. ""Have I pleased you to-night?"" she inquired of Schtoltz.

Three weeks later Andrushka, Petrushka, and Vassika were ordered to chop the planks and the remainder of the balustrade in pieces, and then to remove the fragments to the outbuildings, lest the road should become obstructed; and in the outbuildings those fragments tossed about until the following spring. Every time that the elder Oblomov saw them from the window he fell to thinking what had best be done with them. Summoning the carpenter, he took counsel with the man as to whether he had better build a new gallery or pull down what was left of the old one; until finally he dismissed his subordinate with the words, ""Do you wait a little until I have considered the matter further."

"Другой бы прибавил: пишу и обливаюсь слезами , но я не рисуюсь перед вами, не драпируюсь в свою печаль, потому что не хочу усиливать боль, растравлять сожаление, грусть. Вся эта драпировка скрывает обыкновенно умысел глубже пустить корни на почве чувства, а я хочу истребить и в вас и в себе семена его. Да и плакать пристало или соблазнителям, которые ищут уловить фразами неосторожное самолюбие женщин, или томным мечтателям. Я говорю это, прощаясь, как прощаются с добрым другом, отпуская его в далекий путь. Недели чрез три, чрез месяц было бы поздно, трудно: любовь делает неимоверные успехи, это душевный антонов огонь. И теперь я уже ни на что не похож, не считаю часы и минуты, не знаю восхождения и захождения солнца, а считаю: видел — не видал, увижу — не увижу, приходила — не пришла, придет… Все это к лицу молодости, которая легко переносит и приятные и неприятные волнения; а мне к лицу покой, хотя скучный, сонный, но он знаком мне; а с бурями я не управлюсь.","Another would add: I write and shed tears, but I don’t show off in front of you, I don’t drape in my sadness, because I don’t want to intensify pain, inflame regret, sadness. All this drapery usually hides the intention to take root deeper on the soil of feeling, and I want to destroy its seeds both in you and in myself. Yes, and it is fitting to cry either for seducers who are looking to capture the careless pride of women in phrases, or for languid dreamers. I say this, saying goodbye, as one says goodbye to a good friend, letting him go on a long journey. In three weeks, in a month it would be too late, it would be difficult: love is making incredible progress, this is the spiritual fire of Antonov. And now I don’t look like anything, I don’t count hours and minutes, I don’t know the rising and setting of the sun, but I count: I saw - I didn’t see, I see - I don’t see, I came - I didn’t come, it will come ... All this is in the face of youth, which easily tolerates both pleasant and unpleasant unrest; and peace suits me, although boring, sleepy, but it is familiar to me; and I can't handle the storms.","Another would have added that I’m writing bathed in tears, but I’m not going to pose for you or drape myself in my sorrow because I don’t want to add to your pain or stir up your compassion and grief. All that draping usually conceals the intention to plant deeper roots in emotion’s soil, and I want to eradicate the seeds of this in you and in me. In any case, weeping is either for seducers seeking to snare women’s incautious vanity with their pretty phrases, or for languid dreamers. I say this, in parting, as one parts with a good friend, letting him go on a long journey. In a few weeks, or a month, it would be too late, too hard. Love is having incredible success; it is a St. Anthony’s fire of emotions. Even now I don’t recognize myself, I don’t keep track of the hours and minutes. I don’t know the rising and setting of the sun. But I do keep track of whether I have or haven’t seen you, will or won’t see you, whether you were coming and didn’t but will. All this suits youth, which easily endures upheavals both pleasant and unpleasant; but what suits me is serenity, boring and sleepy though it may be, but it’s what I know . I cannot cope with storms.","‘Another man might have added: I write this in a flood of tears, but I am not trying to show off before you, I do not parade my grief, because I do not want to make the pain worse, to aggravate regret and sorrow. All such showing off generally conceals the intention of making the feeling strike deeper roots, and I want to destroy its seeds in both you and me. Besides, tears are suitable either to seducers who try to capture a woman’s imprudent vanity by phrases, or to languid dreamers. I am saying this, parting from you as one parts from a good friend who sets out on a long journey. In another three weeks or in another month it would be too late: love makes incredible progress, it is a kind of gangrene of the soul. Now I am in as bad a state as can be, I don’t count time by hours and minutes, I know nothing of sunrise and sunset, but only by whether I have seen you or have not seen you, whether I shall or shall not see you, whether you have been or not, whether you will come. … All this is all right for youth, which bears easily pleasant and unpleasant sensations; what I want is peace and quiet, however dull and somnolent, for it is familiar to me; for I cannot weather storms.",

Next, an old countess took a fancy to my looks. ' He is of respectable appearance,' she said to herself, and added me to her staff of Swiss lacqueys.

"Штольц уехал в тот же день, а вечером к Обломову явился Тарантьев. Он не утерпел, чтобы не обругать его хорошенько за кума. Он не взял одного в расчет: что Обломов, в обществе Ильинских, отвык от подобных ему явлений, и что апатия и снисхождение к грубости и наглости заменились отвращением.

This would have been revealed long ago and even manifested itself in part when Oblomov was still living at the dacha, but since then Tarantiev visited him less often and, moreover, visited others, and there were no clashes between them.","Stolz left that same day, and that evening Tarantiev went to see Oblomov.

As of old, Agafia Matvievna, his landlady, would come and propose one or another dish for his delectation; also her children would come running to and fro through his rooms.

"«Но, однако ж… Ольга любит меня! — думал он дорогой. — Это молодое, свежее создание!

Наконец, любят и не юношей, не отвагу на лице, не ловкость в мазурке, не скаканье на лошади… Положим, Ольга не дюжинная девушка, у которой сердце можно пощекотать усами, тронуть слух звуком сабли; но ведь тогда надо другое… силу ума, например, чтобы женщина смирялась и склоняла голову перед этим умом, чтоб и свет кланялся ему… Или прославленный артист… А я что такое? Обломов — больше ничего. Вот Штольц — другое дело: Штольц — ум, сила, уменье управлять собой, другими, судьбой. Куда ни придет, с кем ни сойдется — смотришь, уж овладел, играет, как будто на инструменте… А я?.. И с Захаром не управлюсь… и с собой тоже… я — Обломов! Штольц! Боже!.. Ведь она его любит, — в ужасе подумал он, — сама сказала: как друга — говорит она; да это ложь, может быть, бессознательная… Дружбы между мужчиной и женщиной не бывает…»","“But, however ... Olga loves me! he thought dear. “This is a young, fresh creature! The most poetic sphere of life is now open to her imagination: she must dream of young men with black curls, slender, tall, with thoughtful, hidden strength, with courage on their faces, with a proud smile, with this spark in their eyes, which sinks and trembles in their eyes, and so on. easily reaches the heart, with a soft and fresh voice that sounds like a metal string. Finally, they love not young men, not courage on the face, not dexterity in a mazurka, not riding a horse ... Suppose Olga is not a dozen-of-a-kind girl, whose heart can be tickled with a mustache, touched by the sound of a saber; but then something else is needed ... the strength of the mind, for example, so that a woman humbles herself and bows her head before this mind, so that the world bows to him ... Or a famous artist ... And what am I? Oblomov - nothing more. Here Stolz is another matter: Stolz is mind, strength, the ability to control oneself, others, fate. Wherever he comes, with whom he gets along - you look, he has already mastered it, he plays, as if on an instrument ... And I? Stolz! God!.. After all, she loves him, he thought in horror, she herself said: as a friend, she says; Yes, this is a lie, maybe unconscious ... There is no friendship between a man and a woman ... ""","But still . . . Olga does love me! he thought en route. She is a young, free creature! Her imagination has access to the most poetic sphere of life now. She must dream of a young man with black curls, slender and tall, with a pensive hidden strength, valor on his face, a proud smile, a spark in his eyes that drowns and flickers in his glance and touches the heart so easily, and a soft, fresh voice that rings like a metal string. Ultimately, people love men who aren’t young, too, who don’t have valor on their face or agility in a mazurka or on horseback. Presumably, Olga is no commonplace girl whose heart can be tickled by a mustache or moved by the rattle of a saber, but after all then something else is wanted . . . a strong intellect, for instance, to which a woman can submit and bow her head and society can bow down. Or a famous artist. But what am I? Oblomov—nothing more. Now Stolz is another matter. Stolz is intellect, strength, and the ability to control himself, others, and his destiny. No matter where he goes or whom he meets, before you know it he’s taken charge and is playing them like an instrument. But what about me? I can’t even control Zakhar . . . or myself for that matter. I’m Oblomov! Stolz! My God! She is fond of him, he thought, aghast. She said so herself. “Like a friend,” she said. Yes, but that’s a lie, if an unconscious one. There is no such thing as friendship between a man and a woman.","‘But then – Olga loves me!’ he thought on the way. ‘ She who is so young and so fresh! She, whose imagination should be wideawake to the poetic side of life, ought to be dreaming of black-haired, curly-headed youths, tall and slender, with thoughtful, hidden power, with courage in their faces, a proud smile, with that melting and trembling light in the eye that touches the heart so easily, and with a gentle fresh voice that sounds like a harp-string. It is true there are women who do not care for youth, courage, good dancing, clever riding. … Olga, I daresay, is no ordinary girl whose heart can be won by a handsome moustache or whose ears can be charmed by the rattle of a sword; but then something else is needed – intelligence, for instance, so that a woman should yield and bow her head to it as the rest of the world does.… Or a famous artist. … But what am I? Oblomov – and nothing more. Stolz, now, is a different matter: Stolz has intelligence, force, he knows how to control himself, others, and life. Wherever he goes and whoever he meets, he immediately gets the upper hand, playing on people as on an instrument. And I? Why, I can’t get the better of Zakhar even – or of myself – I – Oblomov! Stolz – good Lord, she loves him,’ he thought with horror. ‘ She said so herself. Like a friend, she said. But that’s a lie, an unconscious lie perhaps.

"Тогда еще он был молод, и если нельзя сказать, чтоб он был жив, то, по крайней мере, живее, чем теперь; еще он был полон разных стремлений, все чего-то надеялся, ждал многого и от судьбы, и от самого себя; все готовился к поприщу, к роли — прежде всего, разумеется, в службе, что и было целью его приезда в Петербург. Потом он думал и о роли в обществе; наконец, в отдаленной перспективе, на повороте с юности к зрелым летам, воображению его мелькало и улыбалось семейное счастие.","Then he was still young, and if it cannot be said that he was alive, then at least he is more alive than now; he was also full of various aspirations, he kept hoping for something, expecting a lot both from fate and from himself; everything was preparing for the field, for the role - first of all, of course, in the service, which was the purpose of his arrival in St. Petersburg. Then he thought about his role in society; finally, in the distant future, at the turn from youth to mature years, family happiness flashed and smiled at his imagination.","At the time he was still young, and if he could not have been called lively, then at the least he was livelier than he was now. He was still full of all kinds of aspirations, still hoped for things, still expected much of fate and of himself; he was still preparing for an arena, a role—first and foremost, of course, in service, which had been his purpose in coming to Petersburg. Later, he also thought about his role in society; and finally, in the distant future, at the turning point from youth to maturity, the notion of family happiness flickered and smiled in his imagination.","He was still young then, and while it could not be said that he was lively, he was at all events livelier than now; he was still full of all sorts of aspirations, still hoped for something, and expected a great deal from the future and from himself; he was still preparing himself for a career, for the part he was going to play in life, and, above all, of course for the Civil Service, which was the main reason for his arrival in Petersburg.

"Илья Ильич ходит не так, как ходил ее покойный муж, коллежский секретарь Пшеницын, мелкой, деловой прытью, не пишет беспрестанно бумаг, не трясется от страха, что опоздает в должность, не глядит на всякого так, как будто просит оседлать его и поехать, а глядит он на всех и на все так смело и свободно, как будто требует покорности себе.","Ilya Ilyich walks differently than her late husband, collegiate secretary Pshenitsyn, walked with petty, businesslike agility, does not constantly write papers, does not tremble with fear that he will be late for his post, does not look at everyone as if asking to saddle him and go, but he looks at everyone and everything so boldly and freely, as if demanding obedience to himself.","Ilya Ilich did not walk the way her deceased husband, Collegiate Secretary Pshenitsyn, had walked—with a short, brisk step. He was not constantly writing documents, or quaking with fear at being late to the office, or looking at everyone as if they were asking to saddle him and ride off. Rather, he looked at everyone and everything quite boldly and freely, as if demanding their deference.","Oblomov did not walk like her husband, the late Collegiate Secretary Pshenitzyn, with small, quick, business-like steps, he did not write endless documents, he did not shake with fear at being late at the office, he did not look at people as though begging them to saddle him and ride on his back, but he looked at everything and everybody openly and fearlessly, as though expecting them to obey him.","Also they know that beyond it stand Saratov and Nizhni Novgorod--likewise they have heard that such places as Moscow and Petrograd exist, and that on the farther side of them dwell folk who are known as Germans and French; but beyond that point there begins for them, as it did for the ancients, a mysterious world of unknown countries which are peopled with monsters and two-headed giants, and bounded on the outer side by a void of mist, and, again, by the colossal fish which bears the world on its back."

"Захару он тоже надоедал собой. Захар, отслужив в молодости лакейскую службу в барском доме, был произведен в дядьки к Илье Ильичу и с тех пор начал считать себя только предметом роскоши, аристократическою принадлежностью дома, назначенною для поддержания полноты и блеска старинной фамилии, а не предметом необходимости. От этого он, одев барчонка утром и раздев его вечером, остальное время ровно ничего не делал.","He also bored Zakhar with himself. Zakhar, having served as a servant in a manor's house in his youth, was promoted to uncle to Ilya Ilyich and from then on began to consider himself only a luxury item, an aristocratic accessory of the house, appointed to maintain the fullness and splendor of an old family, and not a necessity. Because of this, having dressed the barchon in the morning and undressed him in the evening, he did absolutely nothing the rest of the time.","Zakhar was equally sick and tired of his master.

This is why, having dressed his little master in the morning and undressed him at night, he did absolutely nothing the rest of the time.","Zakhar, too, was often tired of his master. Having served his term as a footman in his youth, Zakhar had been appointed to look after the young master; from that day he began to regard himself as an article of luxury, an aristocratic accessory of the house, whose duty it was to keep up the prestige and splendour of an old family and not to be of any real use. That was why, having dressed the young master in the morning and undressed him in the evening, he spent the rest of the day doing nothing at all.",
"И сам домик обветшал немного, глядел небрежно, нечисто, как небритый и немытый человек.

Когда кто войдет в калитку, старая арапка не скачет бодро на цепи, а хрипло и лениво лает, не вылезая из конуры.","And the house itself was a little dilapidated, looked careless, unclean, like an unshaven and unwashed person. The paint peeled off, the rain pipes were broken in places: therefore, there were puddles of mud in the yard, through which, as before, a narrow plank was thrown. When someone enters the gate, the old black-haired woman does not gallop cheerfully on the chain, but barks hoarsely and lazily without getting out of the kennel.","The little house itself had become rather dilapidated and looked untended and unclean, like a man who has not shaved or washed.

In places the paint has peeled away, and in others the gutters are broken.

Should a visitor approach the wicket, the old watchdog no longer leaps nimbly to the extent of his chain, but gives tongue hoarsely and lazily from the interior of his kennel."
"Он чувствовал, что и его здоровый организм не устоит, если продлятся еще месяцы этого напряжения ума, воли, нерв.

But of course with a man like the vice-director of our department it’s a pleasure. He never fails to reward a good and conscientious official for faithful service, and he doesn’t forget those who don’t do any work, either. Those who have done their term of service he recommends for promotion; and for those who aren’t due for promotion or the conferment of an order he’ll try to get a bonus.’",

She would be grinding coffee and not remember what she was doing, or throw in so much chicory that it was undrinkable—but not taste it, as if she had no tongue.

"— А наша лучшая молодежь, что она делает? Разве не спит, ходя, разъезжая по Невскому, танцуя? Ежедневная пустая перетасовка дней! А посмотри, с какою гордостью и неведомым достоинством, отталкивающим взглядом смотрят, кто не так одет, как они, не носит их имени и звания. И воображают, несчастные, что еще они выше толпы: «Мы-де служим, где, кроме нас, никто не служит; мы в первом ряду кресел, мы на бале у князя N, куда только нас пускают»… А сойдутся между собой, перепьются и подерутся, точно дикие! Разве это живые, неспящие люди? Да не одна молодежь: посмотри на взрослых. Собираются, кормят друг друга, ни радушия, ни доброты, ни взаимного влечения! Собираются на обед, на вечер, как в должность, без веселья, холодно, чтоб похвастать поваром, салоном, и потом под рукой осмеять, подставить ногу один другому. Третьего дня, за обедом, я не знал, куда смотреть, хоть под стол залезть, когда началось терзание репутаций отсутствующих: «Тот глуп, этот низок, другой вор, третий смешон» — настоящая травля! Говоря это, глядят друг на друга такими же глазами: «вот уйди только за дверь, и тебе то же будет»… Зачем же они сходятся, если они таковы? Зачем так крепко жмут друг другу руки? Ни искреннего смеха, ни проблеска симпатии! Стараются залучить громкий чин, имя. «У меня был такой-то, а я был у такого-то», — хвастают потом… Что ж это за жизнь? Я не хочу ее.

And the unfortunate ones imagine that they are still higher than the crowd: “We serve, where, apart from us, no one serves; we are in the first row of seats, we are at the ball at Prince N, wherever they let us in ”... And they will converge among themselves, get drunk and fight, like wild ones! Are they living, sleepless people? Yes, not only young people: look at adults. They gather, feed each other, no cordiality, no kindness, no mutual attraction! They gather for dinner, for the evening, as if on duty, without fun, it’s cold, to boast of a cook, a salon, and then at hand to ridicule, to substitute one foot for another. On the third day, at dinner, I didn’t know where to look, even to crawl under the table, when the tormenting reputations of those absent began: “That one is stupid, this one is low, another thief, the third one is ridiculous” - real persecution! Saying this, they look at each other with the same eyes: “just go out the door, and you will have the same thing” ... Why do they converge, if they are like that? Why do they shake hands so tightly? No sincere laughter, no glimmer of sympathy! They are trying to get a high-profile rank, a name. “I had such and such, and I had such and such,” they boast later ... What kind of life is this?

They gather and feed each other without the slightest kindness, or goodness, or mutual attraction!

Why, are these alive, wide-awake people? And it isn’t just the young people, either. Take a look at the older people. They meet, entertain each other at meals, but there is no real good-fellowship, no real hospitality, no mutual sympathy. If they meet at a dinner or a party, it is just the same as at their office – coldly, without a spark of gaiety, to boast of their chef or their drawing-room, and then to jeer at each other in a discreet aside, to trip one another up. The other day at dinner I honestly did not know where to look and wished I could hide under the table, when they began tearing to shreds the reputations of those who did not happen to be there: so-and-so is an ass, so-and-so is a mean scoundrel; that one is a thief, and another one is ridiculous – a regular massacre! And as they said it, they looked at each other as if to say, “Just go out of the door, my dear fellow, and we’ll do the same to you.” Why, then, do they meet if they are like that? Why do they press each other’s hands so warmly? No genuine laughter, no glimmer of sympathy! They are all out to get someone of high rank, someone with a name, to come to their place. “So-and-so has called on me,” they boast afterwards. “I’ve been to see so-and-so.” What kind of life is that?

"Как там отец его, дед, дети, внучата и гости сидели или лежали в ленивом покое, зная, что есть в доме вечно ходящее около них и промышляющее око и непокладные руки, которые обошьют их, накормят, напоят, оденут и обуют и спать положат, а при смерти закроют им глаза, так и тут Обломов, сидя и не трогаясь с дивана, видел, что движется что-то живое и проворное в его пользу, и что не взойдет завтра солнце, застелют небо вихри, понесется бурный ветр из концов в концы вселенной, а суп и жаркое явятся у него на столе, а белье его будет чисто и свежо, а паутина снята со стены, и он не узнает, как это сделается, не даст себе труда подумать, чего ему хочется, а оно будет угадано и принесено ему под нос, не с ленью, не с грубостью, не грязными руками Захара, а с бодрым и кротким взглядом, с улыбкой глубокой преданности, чистыми, белыми руками и с голыми локтями.","How was his father, grandfather, children, grandchildren and guests sitting or lying in lazy peace, knowing that in the house there is an eye that always walks around them and provides foresight and unyielding hands that will sew them, feed, drink, dress and shoe and put them to sleep , and at death they will close their eyes, so here Oblomov, sitting and not moving from the sofa, saw that something living and agile was moving in his favor, and that the sun would not rise tomorrow, whirlwinds would cover the sky, a stormy wind would rush from the ends to the ends of the universe, and soup and roast will appear on his table, and his linen will be clean and fresh, and the cobwebs have been removed from the wall, and he will not know how it will be done, will not take the trouble to think what he wants, but it will be guessed and brought under his breath, not with laziness, not with rudeness, not with Zakhar's dirty hands, but with a cheerful and meek look, with a smile of deep devotion, clean, white hands and bare elbows.","The way his father, his grandfather, their children, grandchildren, and guests sat or reclined in lazy tranquility, knowing that there was a steady, industrious eye and restless hands in the house to sew for them, give them food and drink, clothe their bodies and shod their feet, and put them to bed, and when they died to shut their eyes—this was how Oblomov, here, sitting and never stirring from the sofa, saw this lively and deft movement for his benefit.

The costume in question consisted of a dressing-gown of some Persian material--a real Eastern dressing-gown--a garment that was devoid both of tassels and velvet facings and a waist, yet so roomy that Oblomov might have wrapped himself in it once or twice over. Also, in accordance with the immutable custom of Asia, its sleeves widened steadily from knuckles to shoulder. True, it was a dressing-gown which had lost its pristine freshness, and had, in places, exchanged its natural, original sheen for one acquired by hard wear; yet still it retained both the clarity of its Oriental colouring and the soundness of its texture."
"Дело в том, что Обломов накануне получил из деревни, от своего старосты, письмо неприятного содержания. Известно, о каких неприятностях может писать староста: неурожай, недоимки, уменьшение дохода и т. п. Хотя староста и в прошлом и в третьем году писал к своему барину точно такие же письма, но и это последнее письмо подействовало так же сильно, как всякий неприятный сюрприз.","The fact is that on the eve of Oblomov received from the village, from his headman, a letter of unpleasant content. It is known what kind of troubles the headman can write about: crop failure, arrears, a decrease in income, etc. Although the headman wrote exactly the same letters to his master last year and in the third year, this last letter also had an effect as strong as any an unpleasant surprise.","The problem was that the previous evening Oblomov had received a letter of distasteful content from his bailiff in the country. One knows what distasteful things a bailiff can write about: crop failure, arrears, reduced income, and so forth. Although both last year and the year before that the bailiff had written his master precisely the same letter, nonetheless this last letter had had a powerful effect on him, like any nasty surprise.","What had happened was that on the previous evening Oblomov had received a disagreeable letter from the bailiff of his estate. The sort of disagreeable news a bailiff usually sends can be easily imagined: bad harvest, arrears of taxes due from the peasants, falling income, and so on. Though the bailiff had written identical letters to his master the year before and the year before that, this last letter had the same strong effect as any other unpleasant and unexpected piece of news.",
"Тарантьев смотрел на все угрюмо, с полупрезрением, с явным недоброжелательством ко всему окружающему, готовый бранить все и всех на свете, как будто какой-нибудь обиженный несправедливостью или непризнанный в каком-то достоинстве, наконец, как гонимый судьбою сильный характер, который недобровольно, неуныло покоряется ей.","Tarantiev looked at everything sullenly, with half contempt, with obvious hostility to everything around him, ready to scold everything and everyone in the world, as if some one offended by injustice or unrecognized in some dignity, finally, as a strong character driven by fate, who involuntarily, reluctantly submits to her.","Tarantiev viewed everything sullenly, with poorly disguised contempt and frank ill will toward all around him, prepared to abuse everyone and everything in the world, as if offended by some injustice or unacknowledged for some merit, a strong character, ultimately, hounded but not bowed by fate.","Tarantyev looked at everything morosely, with ill-disguised contempt and open hostility towards the world at large; he was ready to abuse everyone and everything as though he had suffered some injustice or had been offended in his dignity, or like a man of strong character persecuted by destiny and submitting to it under protest and unwillingly.",

"— Вот этот желтый господин в очках, — продолжал Обломов, — пристал ко мне: читал ли я речь какого-то депутата, и глаза вытаращил на меня, когда я сказал, что не читаю газет. И пошел о Лудовике-Филиппе, точно как будто он родной отец ему. Потом привязался, как я думаю: отчего французский посланник выехал из Рима? Как, всю жизнь обречь себя на ежедневное заряжанье всесветными новостями, кричать неделю, пока не выкричишься! Сегодня Мехмет-Али послал корабль в Константинополь, и он ломает себе голову: зачем? Завтра не удалось Дон Карлосу — и он в ужасной тревоге. Там роют канал, тут отряд войска послали на Восток; батюшки, загорелось! лица нет, бежит, кричит, как будто на него самого войско идет. Рассуждают, соображают вкривь и вкось, а самим скучно — не занимает это их; сквозь эти крики виден непробудный сон! Это им постороннее; они не в своей шапке ходят. Дела-то своего нет, они разбросались на все стороны, не направились ни на что. Под этой всеобъемлемостью кроется пустота, отсутствие симпатии ко всему! А избрать скромную, трудовую тропинку и идти по ней, прорывать глубокую колею — это скучно, незаметно; там всезнание не поможет и пыль в глаза пускать некому.","“That yellow gentleman with glasses,” Oblomov continued, “sticked to me: did I read the speech of some deputy, and goggled his eyes at me when I said that I didn’t read newspapers. And he went about Louis Philippe, just as if he were his own father. Then he became attached, as I think: why did the French envoy leave Rome? How do you doom yourself all your life to daily loading with all-world news, screaming for a week until you scream out! Today Mehmet-Ali sent a ship to Constantinople, and he is racking his brains: why? Tomorrow Don Carlos failed - and he is in terrible anxiety. There they are digging a canal, here a detachment of troops has been sent to the East; dude, it's on fire! there is no face, he runs, shouts, as if an army is coming against him. They argue, think at random, but they themselves are bored - this does not interest them; through these cries, an unawakened dream is visible! This is foreign to them; they don't wear their hats. There is nothing of their own, they scattered in all directions, did not go to anything. Under this comprehensiveness lies emptiness, lack of sympathy for everything! And to choose a modest, laboring path and follow it, break through a deep rut - this is boring, imperceptible; there omniscience will not help and there is no one to throw dust in the eyes.","“Take that yellow gentleman in spectacles,” continued Oblomov. “He badgered me about whether I had read some deputy’s speech, and he stared at me when I said I didn’t read the newspapers. He went on about Louis Philippe as if he were his own father. Then he pestered me for my opinion about why the French ambassador had left Rome. Why should I condemn myself to filling up every day with colorless news and shouting for a week until I’m all shouted out? Today Mehmet-Ali sent a ship to Constantinople, and he’s wracking his brains trying to figure out why. Tomorrow Don Carlos can’t do something and he’s in a terrible state. A canal is being dug there, while here a detachment of troops has been sent to the Orient. Good gracious! He’s burning to go. He looks awful. He’s running and shouting as if the troops were coming straight at him. They reason and ponder pell-mell, but they themselves are bored. They’re not interested. Through these shouts you can see the eternal rest! This is alien to them; they’re fish out of water. There is nothing they care about so they rush in all directions without any destination in mind. This all-encompassing sweep hides their emptiness and lack of sympathy for anything! Whereas choosing a modest path of labor and following it, digging a deep rut—that’s tedious and insignificant. Omniscience is useless there and there’s no one to fool.”","‘That sallow-faced gentleman in glasses,’ Oblomov went on, ‘kept asking me if I had read the speech of some French deputy, and glared at me when I told him that I did not read the papers. And he kept talking and talking about Louis-Philippe as though he were his own father. Then he kept pestering me to tell him why the French ambassador had left Rome. Do you expect me to load myself every day with a fresh supply of world news and then to shout about it all week till it runs out? To-day Mahomet-Ali dispatched a ship to Constantinople and he is racking his brains wondering why. To-morrow Don Carlos has a setback and he is terribly worried. Here they are digging a canal, there a detachment of troops has been sent to the East: good Lord, it’s war! He looks terribly upset, he runs, he shouts, as though an army was marching against him personally. They argue, they discuss everything from every possible point of view, but they are bored, they are not really interested in the whole thing: you can see they are fast asleep in spite of their shouts! The whole thing does not concern them; it is as if they walked about in borrowed hats. They have nothing to do, so they squander their energies all over the place without trying to aim at anything in particular. The universality of their interests merely conceals emptiness and a complete absence of sympathy with everything! To choose the modest path of hard work and follow it, to dig a deep channel – is dull and unostentatious, and knowing everything would be of no use there, and there would be no one to impress!’",

He knew his parent would never dream of not believing how many haycocks had been harvested or mowed, or of fining someone for a misdeed, but just fail to give him a handkerchief quickly enough and he would start shouting about how things had gone to hell in a hand basket and turning the entire house upside down.","Perhaps Oblomov had observed and understood long ago what was being said and done in his presence: that his father, dressed in velveteen trousers and a brown quilted cotton coat, did nothing but walk up and down the room all day with his hands behind his back, take snuff, and blow his nose, while his mother passed on from coffee to tea, from tea to dinner; that it never entered his father’s head to check how many stacks of hay or corn had been mown or reaped, and call to account those who were guilty of neglecting their duties, but if his handkerchief was not handed to him soon enough, he would make a scene and turn the whole house upside down.",

"И вот воображению спящего Ильи Ильича начали так же по очереди, как живые картины, открываться сначала три главные акта жизни, разыгрывавшиеся как в его семействе, так у родственников и знакомых: родины, свадьба, похороны.","And so the imagination of the sleeping Ilya Ilyich began, just as in turn, like living pictures, to open at first the three main acts of life, played out both in his family and with relatives and friends: homeland, wedding, funeral.","So to the imagination of the sleeping Ilya Ilich there began to be revealed, also in turn, like tableaux vivants, first, the three main acts of life that had been played out both in his family and among his relatives and acquaintances: birth, wedding, and funeral.","And so, too, like living pictures, there unrolled themselves in turn before the imagination of Oblomov in his sleep the three main events of life, as they happened in his family and among his relations and friends: births, marriages, and funerals.",
"— Штольц? — в тревоге говорил Обломов, озираясь кругом, куда бы уйти. — Боже! что он скажет, как увидит… Скажите, что я уехал! — торопливо прибавил он и ушел к хозяйке в комнату.","— Stolz? - Oblomov said in alarm, looking around, where to go. - God! what will he say when he sees ...

"— А ты тем временем вот что сделаешь, кум, — продолжал Тарантьев, — ты выведи какие-нибудь счеты, какие хочешь, за дрова, за капусту, ну, за что хочешь, благо Обломов теперь передал куме хозяйство, и покажи сумму в расход. А Затертый, как приедет, скажем, что привез оброчных денег столько-то, и что в расход ушли.","“And in the meantime, this is what you will do, godfather,” continued Tarantiev, “you withdraw any bills you want, for firewood, for cabbage, well, for whatever you want, since Oblomov has now transferred the household to the godfather, and show the amount to be spent . And Zaterty, as soon as he arrives, we will say that he brought so much quitrent money, and that they have gone to the expense.","“Meanwhile, here’s what you do, old chum,” continued Tarantiev. “You bring out some bills, for anything—fuel, cabbage, whatever you like—seeing as Oblomov’s handed his household over to your sister, and show him how much you spent. And Zaterty, when he comes, we’ll say he brought the quit-rent but it went to cover what Oblomov spent.”","‘In the meantime, old man,’ Tarantyev went on, ‘you’d better do this: make out some bills – any you like – for fuel or cabbage or whatever you please, since Oblomov has transferred the management of his household to your sister, and show it to him. And when Zatyorty arrives we shall say that all the taxes he collected went to meet the expenses.’","As for the tutor himself, he was both capable and strict--like most Germans; wherefore Oblomov might have received a good education had Oblomovka stood five hundred versts from Verklevo. As it was, the atmosphere, the mode of life, and the customs of Oblomovka extended also to Verklevo, and the one place represented a sort of replica of the other, until only old Schtoltz's establishment stood clear of the primordial mist of laziness, of simplicity of morals, of inertia, and of immobility for which Oblomovka was distinguished."
"Цыплята не пищали больше, они давно стали пожилыми курами и прятались по курятникам.

He had not had time to read the books Olga had sent him: having read as far as the hundred and fifth page of one book, he put it away face downwards, and so it lay for several days.","Unfortunately, in his dark-grey eyes there was an absence of any definite idea, and in his other features a total lack of concentration. Suddenly a thought would wander across his face with the freedom of a bird, flutter for a moment in his eyes, settle on his half-opened lips, and remain momentarily lurking in the lines of his forehead."

Having arrived at this decision, he felt easier. Two days later, Zakhar entered the room with a letter from Olga. ""I cannot wait until Wednesday,"" she wrote. ""I feel so lost through these long absences from your side that I shall look to see you in the Summer Gardens at three o'clock to-morrow."" ""I cannot go,"" he thought to himself. The next moment he comforted himself with the reflection that very likely her aunt, or some other lady, would be with her; in which case he would have a chance of concealing his nervousness."

Look out!” he said. “This means a dead man: the tip of my nose keeps itching.”,"‘Good heavens,’ he said, ‘what can this mean? Someone’s going to die: the tip of my nose keeps itching.’",

I haven’t seen him for three days.’,
"Она рассказала о прогулках, о парке, о своих надеждах, о просветлении и падении Обломова, о ветке сирени, даже о поцелуе.

Nothing was to be apprehended from monsters--that he knew full well; but always he stood in awe of something which seemed to be awaiting him at every step; and, if left alone in a dark room, or if fated to catch sight of a corpse, he would tremble with that sense of oppressive foreboding which his infancy had instilled into his very being. Inclined, of a morning, to laugh at his fears, of an evening his countenance paled again."

"— Знаешь ли, Андрей, в жизни моей ведь никогда не загоралось никакого, ни спасительного, ни разрушительного огня? Она не была похожа на утро, на которое постепенно падают краски, огонь, которое потом превращается в день, как у других, и пылает жарко, и все кипит, движется в ярком полудне, и потом все тише и тише, все бледнее, и все естественно и постепенно гаснет к вечеру. Нет, жизнь моя началась с погасания. Странно, а это так! С первой минуты, когда я сознал себя, я почувствовал, что я уже гасну. Начал гаснуть я над писаньем бумаг в канцелярии; гаснул потом, вычитывая в книгах истины, с которыми не знал, что делать в жизни, гаснул с приятелями, слушая толки, сплетни, передразниванье, злую и холодную болтовню, пустоту, глядя на дружбу, поддерживаемую сходками без цели, без симпатии; гаснул и губил силы с Миной: платил ей больше половины своего дохода и воображал, что люблю ее; гаснул в унылом и ленивом хождении по Невскому проспекту, среди енотовых шуб и бобровых воротников, — на вечерах, в приемные дни, где оказывали мне радушие как сносному жениху; гаснул и тратил по мелочи жизнь и ум, переезжая из города на дачу, с дачи в Гороховую, определяя весну привозом устриц и омаров, осень и зиму — положенными днями, лето — гуляньями и всю жизнь — ленивой и покойной дремотой, как другие… Даже самолюбие — на что оно тратилось? Чтоб заказывать платье у известного портного? Чтоб попасть в известный дом? Чтоб князь П* пожал мне руку? А ведь самолюбие — соль жизни! Куда оно ушло?

Andrey only thought up: “Work and work like a horse!” To what? I am full, dressed.
